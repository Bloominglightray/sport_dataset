        "text": "Bruce Turner Marshall (July 23, 1962 – October 15, 2016) was an American ice hockey coach who was – at his death – the head coach at Franklin Pierce University. He was previously the head coach of the Connecticut Huskies ice hockey team. Marshall took over for Ben Kirtland prior to the start of the 1988–1989 season. In his 24 years as the coach since then, he has transitioned them to Division I status. Just ten years later, in 1998–1999, the Huskies began Division I play. In their first year at the highest level, Connecticut went 20–10–4. The next year was successful as well, for a new program, with a 19–16–1 record overall. However, that success was short lived, as Marshall and the Huskies have finished with a losing record every year since, consistently rating near the very bottom of the RPI ratings. Marshall's 2010–11 season was his best in recent history, however, when he did manage to reach the 2011 AHA semifinals in Rochester.\nOn January 7, 2013, Marshall resigned as head coach for health reasons. He had been on a medical leave of absence since November 6, 2012. Assistant coach David Berard was named head coach for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. Following a nationwide search, Mike Cavanaugh was named as Marshall's replacement after serving 18 years as an assistant at Boston College He died on October 15, 2016, at the age of 54."

        "title": "2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season",
        "text": "The 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season is widely regarded as one of the greatest seasons ever in men's tennis. He ended the year with an impressive 10–1 record against Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the other two best players of the year. From the start of the year, he went undefeated until the French Open semifinals in June (losing to Federer), compiling a 41-match winning streak. Djokovic won ten tournaments, in which three of them were Grand Slam events: the Australian Open, Wimbledon Championships and the US Open. He won a then record (since broken by himself) five Masters Series 1000 titles: Indian Wells, Miami and Canada, played on hard courts, and Madrid and Rome, on clay. Djokovic also won in Dubai and at the Serbia Open. \nDjokovic won seventy matches and lost only six (including two in which he retired due to injury). He beat Nadal in six finals during the season and reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time on 4 July, maintaining the top ranking for the rest of the season. Among the six finals he defeated Nadal, two were in Masters tournaments on clay: a notable reversal due to the fact that he had lost all nine matches played against Nadal on clay prior to this season. He also set a new season record by winning $12.6 million USD in prize money on the ATP World Tour. Furthermore, he obtained a 21-4 record against top-10 and a 13-3 against Top-5 players.\nYear summary.\nEarly Hardcourt events.\nAustralian Open.\nIn the last week of January, Djokovic took on the four-time and reigning champion Roger Federer. The first set was won in a tiebreaker, which went to Djokovic in seven-points-to-three. In the second set, Djokovic took an early break of serve, when Federer overhit his backhand shot. But Djokovic let Federer gain control and Federer broke twice to take a four-games-to-two lead. In a pivotal ninth game, Federer was serving for the set, but hit an ineffective drop shot that allowed Djokovic back into the set. In the eleventh game, Federer again lost serve, paving the way for Djokovic to go up two-sets-to-none. Federer broke Djokovic in the eight game of the third set to level it at four-games all, but Djokovic broke again in the ninth game. This allowed Djokovic to serve out the match.\nIn the final, Djokovic took on Andy Murray, with Murray coming under serious duress in the second game, when he had to survive a 14-minute service game. Murray held serve at this key juncture, and the first set stayed on serve until the tenth game. During that crucial game, they were embroiled in a 39-shot tussle, which gave the relieved Serb a break point. Djokovic took the break of serve on the subsequent point, and captured the first set in a hard-fought 59 minutes. Djokovic quickly overcame the Briton in the second set to take a five-games-to-none advantage, which allowed him to take the set, only losing two games. Djokovic went on to win the third set, which allowed him to capture his second Australian Open title.\nDubai.\nIn February in the Dubai final, Federer was unable to hold serve in the third game, allowing Djokovic to get the upper hand in the first set. In the second set Federer was first to break, but he could not hold on to the advantage. Djokovic won the match.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nIn the first half of March Djokovic met Federer in the semifinals of Indian Wells, and they split the opening two sets of the match. Djokovic quickly broke Federer's service in the third set, but had to stave off two break points on his own serve to go up two-games-to-love. The players traded breaks until Djokovic won the final four games to take the set and match. With this win Djokovic moved up to Number 2 in the ATP World Tour Rankings.\nDjokovic played Rafael Nadal in the final, for their first encounter of the season. The first set went to Nadal via two breaks of Djokovic's serve. In the second set, Djokovic was up five-games-to-three, and faced five deuces before taking the set. In the third set Djokovic took command and lost only two games to take victory.\nMiami Masters.\nIn the second half of March Djokovic met Nadal for the second time of the season in the finals yet again. Nadal quickly took a three-games-to-one advantage, and saved breakpoints to advance to five-games-to-one. Djokovic recovered a break but couldn't avoid losing the set. Djokovic started well in the second set, going up four-games-to-love. Djokovic won the second set to force a deciding third set. The final set was decided in a tiebreak. Djokovic got down early in the tiebreak, but recovered to win the match.\nClay court events.\nSerbia Open.\nIn April in his hometown tournament Djokovic met Spaniard Feliciano López in the final of the Serbia Open in Belgrade. The first set went to a tiebreaker, which was won by Djokovic. Djokovic went on to the victory in the match, only losing two games in the second set.\nMadrid Masters.\nIn May in the final of the Madrid Masters, Djokovic took a four-games-to-love lead over Rafael Nadal, but Nadal came back to five-games-all. Djokovic was able to break again and took the opening set. Djokovic got broken in the opening service game of the second set, but came back to win the set and the match.\nRome Masters.\nDjokovic met Andy Murray in the semifinals of the Rome Masters. Djokovic went to a one set lead. Murray took the second set with just one break of serve in the sixth game of the set. In the third set, Murray was serving for the match at five-games-to-four, but Djokovic broke back. The match was decided in a tiebreak, with Djokovic winning it.\nDjokovic played Nadal in the finals. Djokovic failed to serve for the set after getting a break in the eight game, but took the set after getting another break. The second set was very close, with Djokovic converting his fourth match point to win the title, his second Masters title on clay courts this year.\nWith this victory Djokovic was the first player to qualify for the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals.\nFrench Open.\nDjokovic met Roger Federer in the semifinals. It was the first time the two rivals met at Roland Garros. Federer went into the match with a 13–9 lead in their head-to-head matchup as well as a 2–1 lead in their head-to-head on clay. The first set featured an exchange of breaks, with Federer taking the tiebreak when Djokovic hit a forehand into the net at 5–6. In the second set Federer capitalized on an early break to take a two sets lead. Djokovic came back by winning the third set. The fourth set was close with both players holding serve through the first eight games. In the ninth game Djokovic finally managed to break and prepared to serve to level the match. Federer broke back. Djokovic had another break opportunity in the eleventh service game, but the set went into a tiebreak. Roger Federer finally sealed the match with an ace on his first match point. The loss marked Djokovic's first defeat of the season (with Federer also being the last man to defeat Djokovic in 2010), ending a 43-match win streak and his chance to win the Calendar Year Grand Slam.\nGrass court events.\nWimbledon Championships.\nIn June Djokovic took on Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals of Wimbledon. The match started out in an inauspicious way for Djokovic, as he was broken in his opening service game. Djokovic broke back in tenth game, and went on to win the first set in a tiebreak. Djokovic also took the second set. The third set was an up-and-down affair with several breaks of serve, but also ended in a tiebreak. Tsonga took this third set. Next Djokovic won the fourth set and the match. This win allowed Djokovic to take over the World Number 1 ranking from Rafael Nadal.\nDjokovic met Nadal for their first meeting in a Wimbledon final. Djokovic took the first set with his first break in the match. The second and third sets were quite lopsided affairs. Djokovic took the second set, but Nadal hit back in the third set.

This was Djokovic's fifth Masters Series victory for the season, a record.\nCincinnati Masters.\nDjokovic faced Andy Murray in the finals. The match stayed on serve until the seventh game, when Murray got a break, allowing him to take the opening set. After Murray won the first three games in the second set, Djokovic retired from the match with a shoulder injury.\nUS Open.\nDjokovic met Federer in the US Open for the fifth year in a row, this time in the semi-finals. Federer took the first two sets, and Djokovic won the next two sets. In the decisive fifth set, Djokovic dropped his serve in the eighth game, allowing Federer to serve for the match. Federer got two match points, but Djokovic was able to save them and break back. With another break of serve Djokovic won the match and reached his third Major final of the season.\nDjokovic played Nadal in the final, their second successive Major final, and their sixth encounter in a final for the season. The first two sets saw Nadal taking two-games-to-love leads. But on both occasions Djokovic recovered to take a two sets lead. Djokovic was serving for the match in the twelfth game of the third set, but was broken by Nadal. Nadal took that set in a tiebreak. Despite receiving treatment early in the fourth set, Djokovic went on to win the match in four sets, taking his first US Open title.\nLate Hardcourt events.\nIn October at the 2011 Swiss Indoors, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Kei Nishikori, for only his fourth loss of the season.\nIn November during the Paris Masters, Djokovic withdrew against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nDjokovic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the fifth consecutive year. Novak was drawn into group A alongside Tomáš Berdych, David Ferrer and Andy Murray.

With a 1–2 record in the round-robin stage he was eliminated from the tournament.\nDavis Cup.\nIn September Djokovic missed the first rubber of the Davis Cup tie vs Argentina. He came back to play Juan Martín del Potro in the fourth rubber, and lost the first set, before withdrawing with injury midway through the second set. Serbia lost the tie.\nHopman Cup.\nIn January Djokovic teamed up with Ana Ivanovic to represent Serbia in the Hopman Cup. They reached the final, but had to withdraw before the match because Ivanovic sustained an injury.\nAnalysis.\nIt is considered one of the best seasons in the history of tennis. It is considered one of Djokovic's two absolute best seasons, alongside his 2015 season. Pete Sampras hailed Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he has ever seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of sports.\" Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time,\" adding that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\" John McEnroe stated after Djokovic won the 2011 US Open final against Nadal that \"Djokovic is having the greatest year in the history of our sport, there's no doubt about it.\" At the end of the season, Rafael Nadal, who went 0–6 against Djokovic, all in finals, stated that \"It’s probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\" Former world No. 7, Mardy Fish, declared in 2023 that 2011 Djokovic was \"the best player of all time.\"\nDjokovic was dominant against Federer and Nadal, the other two best players of 2011, going 10–1 against them. Noticeably, Nadal was coming off of his best season ever in 2010, and was his prime, yet was unable to notch one win against Djokovic throughout the entire season, being handily beaten in six Big Title finals, and would have had a season statistically equal to, if not better than, 2010 if not for Djokovic. This is confirmed by Nadal in 2016 who stated in an interview with \"Tennis Magazine\" that \"In 2011, my problem was Djokovic because I was winning against everybody and losing against him in the finals.\" Noticeably, Nadal was beaten in straight sets at two clay Masters finals while in his prime on clay. Thus Djokovic's 2011 season is praised as the best by some, for his dominance and the high level of competition he faced, including dominating Nadal and Federer at or near their best.\nDjokovic was praised for his exceptional movement and incredible athleticism shown throughout the season, along with his service having improved, along with the tremendous pressure he put on his opponents service games. His incredible ability at returning led him to having the season best return games won statistics (38.84%). He also had the season best return games won statistics on hardcourts (41.03%). He had the season best second serve return points won (57.54%). With that, he also had the season best second serve return points won on hardcourts (57.86%). With his incredible returning, he hit a return winner against Federer on Federer's first of two match points, both of which Djokovic saved, in the 2011 US Open semifinals, which has been praised as one of the best ever.\nJustin Gimelstob attributed Djokovic's consistency to the improvement in his service game, particularly when it came to his second services, which was just one percent behind of those statistic leaders like Nadal and Federer. According to him Djokovic's strength derived from his agility, his backhand and his return of serve, which was the best on the 2011 tour. \nAll matches.\nThis table lists all the matches of Djokovic this year, including walkovers W/O (they are marked ND for non-decision)\nYearly records.\nHead-to-Head matchups.\nNovak Djokovic has a record against the top 10, against the top 50, and ) against other players.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\"\nEarnings.\nNovak Djokovic earned a record-breaking $12.6 million throughout the season."

He was an All-American at Loyola University of Chicago and is best remembered for hitting the game-winning shot as time expired in the overtime period of the 1963 NCAA championship game.\nRouse, a 6'7\" forward from Pearl High School in Nashville, Tennessee, played college basketball for Loyola for coach George Ireland. He, along with high school teammate Les Hunter, joined the Ramblers and helped them become the first NCAA champion to feature four African-American starters in his junior year. Rouse anchored the middle, leading the team in rebounding as a sophomore (11.3 per game) and junior (12.1 per game). In the championship season of 1962–63, Rouse averaged 13.5 points.\nRouse is best known for following Hunter's miss as time expired to defeat Cincinnati and spoil that school's bid to win a third straight NCAA title. The shot gave Loyola its first, and so far only, NCAA basketball championship. Rouse and the four other Loyola starters played the entire championship game, without substitution.\nIn his senior year, Loyola returned four starters and had eyes on repeating as champions. Rouse upped his averages to 15.6 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. However, he dislocated his shoulder early in the season, hampering his effectiveness. Rouse was still named an honorable mention All-American at the close of the season. Rouse scored 1,169 points and grabbed 982 rebounds in his Loyola career. His #40 jersey was retired in 1993.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Rouse was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals in the 1964 NBA draft (seventh round, 60th pick); however, he never played in the league. Instead, Rouse earned three master's degrees and a PhD. During his postgraduate academic study, he served as a student member of the Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees from 1971 to 1974. He owned his own educational consulting firm and taught courses at the University of Maryland.\nOn July 11, 2013, to observe the 50th anniversary of the national championship, President Barack Obama welcomed surviving Loyola players Hunter, Jerry Harkness, John Egan and Ron Miller to the Oval Office to honor the team. The entire squad was then inducted in November of that year by the College Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHe died on May 31, 1999, in Annapolis, Maryland at age 56."

        "title": "2011–12 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2011–12 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2011–2012 NCAA Division I basketball season. They were led by John Thompson III and played their home games at the Verizon Center. They are a member of the Big East Conference. Prior to the season, the Hoyas made a goodwill trip to China for several matches with local teams. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attended their first game, a win over the Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons. Their second game, against the Bayi Rockets, ended in a brawl, causing the team to leave the court while Chinese fans threw garbage and debris. Georgetown won their final games against the Liaoning Dinosaurs and the Taiwanese national team without incident.\nBefore the season began, the team was picked to finish tenth in the Big East Conference standings. However, early road wins against ranked teams like Memphis, Alabama, and Louisville made the team one of the biggest surprises of the 2011–2012 season, elevating their ranking into the top ten in the nation. With a 12–6 conference record, they finished in a three-way tie for fourth place, with tie breakers placing them fifth, over South Florida but behind Cincinnati.\nThe team was ranked No. 15 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 17 in the postseason Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nDuring the offseason, a major shakeup had taken place in the Georgetown roster. Three stars, guard Austin Freeman and forwards Julian Vaughn and Chris Wright, had graduated in 2011, and sophomore reserve guard Vee Sanford had transferred to Dayton after the end of the previous season. Joining the team as freshmen was a much-heralded recruiting class consisting of Mikeal Hopkins, Otto Porter, and Greg Whittington at forward, Jabril Trawick at guard, and Tyler Adams at center, and, after sitting out the previous season, forward Aaron Bowen also began play as a redshirt freshman. Returning upperclassmen were seniors Jason Clark at guard and Henry Sims at center, junior Hollis Thompson at forward, and sophomores Moses Ayegba at center, Nate Lubick at forward, and Markel Starks at guard. Also returning was sophomore John Caprio, a walk-on playing for his second year as a reserve guard. The loss of Freeman, Vaughn, and Wright left the Hoyas with a young and inexperienced team with 10 freshmen and sophomores on the roster for the 2011–12 season and they began the year unranked in the national polls. Expectations for the season were lower than they had been for the past few years, and before the season began, the Big East's coaches picked the Hoyas to finish in 10th place in the 16-team conference.\nGoodwill tour of China.\nFor the first time in their history, the Hoyas went on an overseas trip to play a series of exhibition games – something the NCAA permitted once every four years – visiting China for 10 days in August 2011. Georgetown intended the team's 10-day goodwill tour to be an athletic, cultural, and educational exchange to promote Georgetown University internationally, and scheduled two games in Beijing – billed together as a \"China-U.S. Basketball Friendship Match\" – followed by two in Shanghai, meeting three Chinese teams and one from Taiwan. The Hoyas won the first game, with Vice President Joe Biden looking on.\nThe second game, against the Bayi Rockets, a military team from the Chinese Basketball Association composed of People's Liberation Army personnel, was a rough one, with 11 fouls called against Bayi and 28 against Georgetown in the first half alone. The rough play continued in the second half and the game took on an uglier character, as at one point Bayi forward Xu Zhonghao approached head coach John Thompson III as he stood near the bench and yelled at him at close range, and play had to be stopped again a few moments later when Bayi player Wang Lei was called for a technical foul and vociferously disputed the call. Finally, with 9:32 left to play in the game and the score tied at 64-64, Bayi center-forward Hu Ke fouled Jason Clark, Clark complained to him about it, and the two began shoving each other. Both benches cleared, and an estimated six separate fights took place on the court. Members of the crowd, one of them armed with a stanchion, came on the court to join the fight, and some people threw chairs at the Georgetown players. The Chinese officiating crew fled, and Chinese security personnel made no effort to intervene and calm the crowd. Fearing for his players' safety, head coach John Thompson III pulled his team off the court as Chinese fans bombarded the Hoyas and their fan section with water bottles. The game never was finished, and no box score for it was posted. An unidentified United States Department of State official and a spokesman for the Embassy of China in Washington, D.C., both called the brawl \"unfortunate.\"\nDespite the ugly incident, the Hoyas continued their trip. Before leaving Beijing, the Georgetown team and Bayi players met to exchange apologies and parted company on friendlier terms. Boosted by the infamy of the brawl in Beijing, Georgetown's next game, played in Shanghai, was a hot ticket, and Chinese officials and security personnel kept tight control of the game and the crowd to ensure that nothing untoward happened. Georgetown won both games in Shanghai without any additional controversy, and Hoya coaches and players spent time at a special basketball clinic for Chinese youth, finishing the trip on a positive note.\nNon-conference schedule.\nA little less than three months after returning from China, Georgetown began the 2011–12 season with two easy wins at the Verizon Center. In the first, over a Savannah State team coached by former Hoya player Horace Broadnax, Henry Sims came off the bench to score a game-high and career-high 19 points and Hollis Thompson added 13, while Otto Porter grabbed a game-high eight rebounds. The second win was in a game played at the Verizon Center as part of the \"Opening Round\" of the Maui Invitational Tournament, a newly established round of play in which four teams headed for the tournament on Maui played at home against four mid-major teams which would remain in the Mainland United States to compete with one another in a parallel tournament of their own while the Maui-bound teams played the main tournament in Hawaii. Georgetown's opening-round opponent was UNC Greensboro, and in defeating the Spartans Hollis Thompson scored a game-high 19 points, Jason Clark scored 17 off the bench, and Markel Starks also came off the bench for the first double-digit scoring performance of his collegiate career, adding 11 points.\nGeorgetown then traveled to Lahaina, Hawaii, for the Maui Invitational Tournament proper, facing No. 14 Kansas, the young Georgetown team's first serious challenge, in the first round. Both teams got off to poor offensive starts; the Jayhawks missed eight of their first 12 shots and the Hoyas did not score for the first 3 minutes 52 seconds and hit only four of their first 15 shots. Down 6-0 before their first field goal, the Hoyas came back to take a 12–9 lead with 10:54 left in the half, then fell behind again before tying the game at 19–19 with 8:36 left. After that, Kansas pulled away to a 32–26 lead before the Hoyas again closed the gap, and the Jayhawks went to the locker room at halftime clinging to a 37–35 lead. In the second half, Kansas extended its lead to 44–39 with 17:31 left in the game, but the underdog Hoyas again came back to take a 48–47 lead with 12:28 to play. Sixteen seconds later, Kansas junior forward Thomas Robinson – who finished with a double-double that included a game-high 20 points (12 of them on dunks) and 12 rebounds – scored a two-point jumper that gave the Jayhawks the lead for good. The Hoyas never trailed by more than five points the rest of the way, however, and Kansas did not clinch the win until Kansas junior guard Travis Releford sank two free throws with 16 seconds left to give the Jayhawks a 67–63 lead, then grabbed the rebound when Jason Clark missed on a three-point jumper with eight seconds to play. Kansas prevailed 67–63, with Jason Clark leading the Hoyas with 15 points, Hollis Thompson contributing 14, and Otto Porter adding 12.\nRelegated to the tournament's consolation bracket, Georgetown had an easy win over host Chaminade behind 28 points by Jason Clark and 17 by Otto Porter and advanced to meet its second ranked opponent in three days, No. 8 Memphis. In the first half, both teams repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet with deep three-pointers and many acrobatic dunks and layups. Georgetown made 19 of its 36 shots (52.8%) during the half, while Memphis went 16-for-29 (55.2%). Memphis pulled out to a 9–4 lead with 17:23 left in the first half, but the Hoyas responded with a 17–2 run to take a 21–11 lead with 11:34 until halftime. The Tigers closed to 41–40 with 2:34 remaining, then the Hoyas pulled away again for a 47-42 halftime lead. In the second half, both teams continued their run of spectacular shots, including two notable early dunks by Memphis sophomore center Tarik Black and a dunk and a reverse layup by Henry Sims. Other than a 49-44 Georgetown lead with 19:08 left in regulation, neither team ever led by more than three points for the rest of the game, and the second half saw five ties before its final minute. The Tigers led 78–75 with 2:17 left, but a Jason Clark free throw at 1:43, a Greg Whittington tip shot with 18 seconds left, and a missed three-pointer by Memphis freshman guard-forward Adonis Thomas with two seconds remaining left the score tied at 78–78 at the end of regulation. With 52 seconds left in overtime, Jason Clark hit a three-pointer to give the Hoyas an 88–86 lead, and 18 seconds later Markel Starks stretched it to 90–86 with two free throws. Tigers junior center Stan Simpson made two free throws to close the score to 90–88, then Hollis Thompson sank one of two free throws to increase the Georgetown lead to 91-88 but leaving the door open for the Tigers to tie the game with a final shot and force a second overtime. Memphis sophomore guard Antonio Barton put up a three-point shot at the buzzer, but it fell well short, and Georgetown came away with a 91–88 upset victory and a fifth-place finish in the Maui Invitational. During the game, Jason Clark had a game-high 26 points, Henry Sims had 24 points and eight rebounds, and Market Starks and Hollis Thompson each scored 12.\nThe Hoyas returned home for a convincing come-from-behind win against IUPUI in which Hollis Thompson had a double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Henry Sims and Markel Starks came off the bench to score 14 and 13 points, respectively. Averaging 82 points a game on the season, they then went on the road again to begin December with their third game in 11 days against a ranked opponent, visiting No. 12 Alabama in an SEC–Big East Challenge game. Both teams mounted stingy defenses, but Georgetown's zone defense especially flummoxed Alabama, which missed its first 11 three-point attempts including all nine it attempted in the first half. Georgetown led 23–16 at halftime, Alabama scoring its fewest first-half points since a 16-point performance at Oklahoma State on December 18, 2010. In the second half, the Hoyas extended their lead to eight points, the largest deficit the Crimson Tide had faced all season. Alabama closed to a two-point deficit six times over the next few minutes and even took a brief one-point lead, but the Hoyas quickly took it back as Henry Sims scored seven consecutive points, followed by a Hollis Thompson three-pointer and a Jason Clark basket to give Georgetown a 54–45 lead with 2:57 left in the game. Alabama responded by scoring nine unanswered points, culminating in two free throws by sophomore guard Trevor Releford with 13 seconds left to give the Crimson Tide a 55–54 advantage, only its second lead of the second half. On the Hoyas′ following possession, Jason Clark dribbled down the court and passed the ball to Hollis Thompson, who sank a long three-pointer he launched from in front of the Georgetown bench, giving the Hoyas a last-second 57–55 upset win which broke a 24-game Crimson Tide home winning streak dating back almost two years. Jason Clark had a game-high 22 points, Henry Sims added 13 points, and Hollis Thompson had 12 points and pulled down eight rebounds, and the Hoya defense held the Crimson Tide to 3-of-16 (18.8%) shooting from three-point range.\nGeorgetown rounded out its non-conference schedule by sweeping the homestand that followed, beating all four opponents by double-digit margins ranging from 11 to 40 points and giving the Hoyas an eight-game winning streak. During the homestand, which ended with a rare, regular-season, non-conference rematch with by-then unranked Memphis, Hollis Thompson had 20 points against overmatched NJIT, 12 against Howard, 15 against American, and 17 points and nine rebounds against Memphis. Jason Clark scored 10 points against NJIT, 12 against Howard, and 18 against Memphis. Against American, Henry Sims had an outstanding game, scoring 17 points and grabbing six rebounds in addition to playing an important role noted in a postgame interview by John Thompson III in providing on-court leadership to the Georgetown defense; he followed that with 12 points and nine rebounds against Memphis. Markel Starks scored a game-high 18 points against American and 14 against Memphis, while Otto Porter came off the bench to lead the Hoyas with 13 points against Howard, and narrowly missed a double-double when he pulled down 10 rebounds and scored eight points against American. Mikeal Hopkins came into the NJIT game to score in double digits for the first time in his collegiate career, contributing 12 points. The win over American stretched Georgetown's all-time lead in games between the schools to 44–8, and for the fifth straight season, Georgetown opened with a 10–1 record. Before the Howard game, the Hoyas entered the Top 25 in the national polls for the first time and were ranked No. 18 in the Associated Press Poll; they rose to No. 16 before the American game.\nFreshman center Tyler Adams played 11 minutes in the NJIT game on December 3. Seeing no further action, he suffered chest pains during practice on December 14 and was taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a heart arrhythmia that had the potential to make strenuous activities like basketball dangerous and even lethal, although it was also possible that he could play through an entire career with no serious health problem. Although Adams's parents encouraged him to accept the risk and keep playing, John Thompson III did not want him to risk his health, but offered to keep him on scholarship with a medical hardship waiver so that he could attend Georgetown without counting against the team's scholarship limit. After a month of entertaining offers from other schools that said they would clear him to play if he transferred and contemplating his future, Adams decided to forego his college playing career to stay at Georgetown, saying that he lacked the athleticism to succeed in a National Basketball Association career and that it was important to take advantage of the opportunity to earn a Georgetown degree. Adams became a fixture on the team's bench through the end of his senior season, functioning as a \"de facto\" assistant coach – and John Thompson III would honor him by allowing him one last collegiate appearance as a player in the final Georgetown home game of his senior year in March 2015.\nConference schedule.\nRising to No. 12 in the AP Poll, Georgetown began its Big East season on December 28 by visiting No. 4 Louisville, the Hoyas′ fourth ranked opponent of the year. Off to its best start since the 1974-75 season, Louisville was one of only six undefeated NCAA Division I teams and had a 20-game home winning streak, its longest such streak since 1984. Louisville held a small lead through most of the first half, but the underdog Hoyas stayed close, and at the half Louisville held only a three-point lead, 35–32. Louisville clung to its lead into the second half, and the Hoyas were down 47-45 when Hollis Thompson scored five consecutive points to put them ahead 51–47 with a little less than nine minutes remaining in the game. Officials then called a bench technical foul on Louisville, and Jason Clark sank both free throws to make the score Georgetown 53 Louisville 47. After two Louisville free throws, Markel Starks – who finished with a career-high 20 points – sank two consecutive three-pointers to give the Hoyas a 59–49 lead with 6:06 to play, and a Henry Sims jump hook shot and Starks layup stretched the lead to 63–52 with minutes to play. The Cardinals, who had rallied from deficits of seven or more nine times dating back to the previous season, mounted a comeback with an 11–0 run that tied the game at 63–63 with 2:01 left to play. Otto Porter followed a Henry Sims miss with a layup to put Georgetown back in the lead, 65–63, and Sims then hit two free throws to make the lead 67–63. Two Porter free throws stretched the lead to 69-63 before Louisville sophomore guard Russ Smith sank a three-pointer to close the gap to 69–66. Porter followed with two clutch free throws, and the Hoyas prevailed 71–68. The upset victory was Georgetown's ninth in a row and snapped Louisville's long home winning streak. Porter finished with his first collegiate double-double (14 points and 14 rebounds), and Hollis Thompson scored 10 points. The Hoyas then came home to defeat Providence on New Year's Eve in a low-scoring contest in which Georgetown shot 30.5 percent from the field, its worst offensive performance since John Thompson III's arrival in 2004, but held Providence to 25.5 percent, the Friars′ worst-ever field-goal percentage in a Big East game. Jason Clark had a game-high 16 points against the Friars, while Henry Sims added 11 points and Otto Porter grabbed 12 rebounds. The win extended Georgetown's winning streak to 10, its longest streak since the Final Four team of 2006-07 won 11 in a row.\nThe Hoyas had improved to No. 9 in the AP Poll by the time they hosted No. 20 Marquette in their first game at home against a ranked opponent all season. During the first half and well into the second, it looked as though the Golden Eagles would blow out the Hoyas; Marquette led 43–29 at halftime and extended its lead to 56–39 with 13:10 left to play. However, the Hoyas shot 76 percent from the field during the second half and mounted a comeback led by Jason Clark despite putting four freshmen – Mikael Hopkins, Otto Porter, Jabril Trawick, and Greg Whittington – on the court when upperclassmen Henry Sims and Hollis Thompson got into foul trouble. While the Golden Eagles went cold, not scoring a field goal for minutes, Georgetown cut Marquette's lead to 62–57 with a little over seven minutes remaining, and Hollis Thompson re-entered the game to score five consecutive points and tie the game at 66-66. A Sims layup put the Hoyas ahead 68–66, and the teams traded baskets to even the score at 70-70. Hollis Thompson, whose last-second three-pointer almost five weeks earlier had given Georgetown its win over Alabama, then hit a clutch three-pointer with 24 seconds to play to give Georgetown a 73–70 victory and an 11-game winning streak. Clark finished with a game-high 26 points, Thompson scored 16, and Sims added 13.\nWith an overall record of 13-1 and 3–0 in the Big East, Georgetown followed the win over Marquette with eight straight games against unranked teams, its longest stretch without a ranked opponent since the 2007–08 season. It started with the Hoyas′ only back-to-back losses all season; the first, at West Virginia, ended Georgetown's winning streak at 11 games, and the second, against Cincinnati, was the Hoyas′ first home loss all season. A frightening incident took place in the Cincinnati game on January 9 when Bearcat freshman guard Ge'Lawn Guyn suffered a concussion in a collision with Greg Whittington, could not lift his legs, and had to be taken to a hospital, but he recovered quickly. Hollis Thompson led the Hoyas with 20 points at West Virginia and scored 14 against Cincinnati, Jason Clark finished with 10 points against the Mountaineers and 14 against the Bearcats, Henry Sims scored 10 points against both teams, and Markel Starks contributed 10 points in the Cincinnati game.\nThe Hoyas recovered to win five of their next six games. Hollis Thompson had 20 points against St. John's in a game that dropped the Red Storm to 0–7 against ranked teams and 1–4 at Madison Square Garden on the season, and scored 14 at DePaul in Georgetown's 11th straight win against the Blue Demons, giving the Hoyas a 20-6 all-time series lead over DePaul. Against St. John's, Jason Clark had 15 points and eight rebounds and Otto Porter had a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, while at DePaul Clark finished with a career-high 31 points, Henry Sims had 16, and Porter pulled down 15 rebounds. Against Rutgers, in a game that gave the Hoyas a 10-game home winning streak against the Scarlet Knights dating back to 2000, 10 wins in the teams′ last 11 meetings, and an overall home record against Rutgers of 18–2, Sims had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds and Jason Clark added 11 points. In the loss which followed at Pittsburgh, the Hoya defense allowed the Panthers to shoot 52 percent from the field, the best field-goal percentage by a Georgetown opponent so far that season, but the Georgetown defense recovered against Connecticut in the next game, limiting the Huskies to only 30 percent shooting from the floor (their lowest field-goal percentage since a 23.8 percent effort against Syracuse on February 8, 1997) and to only 44 points, their lowest single-game point total since a 42-point performance, also against Syracuse, on February 1, 1999. The Hoyas followed with a second straight stingy defensive effort in the next game, a win over South Florida. Hollis Thompson scored 11 points against Pittsburgh, and – by then the leading three-point shooter in the Big East – just missed a double-double with 18 points and nine rebounds against Connecticut. Henry Sims scored in double digits in all three games, with 10 points at Pittsburgh, 13 against the Huskies, and a near-double-double with 13 points and nine rebounds against South Florida. Otto Porter led the team against the Panthers with 14 points and came off the bench to add 12 against the Bulls. Jason Clark scored 11 points each against Connecticut and South Florida, and Markel Starks and Jabril Trawick each finished with 10 points against the Bulls, the first time Trawick had scored in double digits in his collegiate career. In the AP Poll, Georgetown dropped to No. 11 after the loss at West Virginia, rose to No. 10 after beating St. John's and to No. 9 after defeating Rutgers, and then dropped again to No. 14 after losing at Pittsburgh, but the Hoyas climbed to No. 12 after the win over South Florida.\nWith an overall record of 18–4, 8–3 in the Big East, the Hoyas traveled to the Carrier Dome on February 8 to play No. 2 Syracuse, the top shooting team in the Big East, unbeaten in 15 home games during the season, and Georgetown's first ranked opponent in five weeks. The game pitted Syracuse's Big East-leading offense (78.1 points per game) against Georgetown's conference-leading defense (giving up only 58.6 points per game and limiting opponents to 27.6 percent in three-point shooting). In a tight first half that saw five ties, neither team had a strong offensive performance; Georgetown shot 39.4 percent from the field during the half, 3-for-13 (23.1%) from three-point range, while the Orange shot just 29 percent overall from the field and 2-for-11 (18.2%) in three-pointers. The underdog Hoyas pulled out to their largest lead of the game, 29–23, with 1:54 left in the half and led 31–27 at halftime, but Syracuse began the second half with an 8–0 run to take a 35–31 lead with just under 18 minutes left in regulation. Otherwise, neither team led by more than three points until the Orange scored five straight points to pull ahead 54–48 with 4:36 left. Georgetown closed to 55–54 with 1:36 to play thanks to two Jason Clark three-pointers, and Greg Whittington hit a free throw with a minute left to tie the game at 55-55, where the score stood at the end of regulation. Otto Porter scored the first four points in overtime, and Georgetown held a 61–59 lead with 2:19 remaining. Syracuse sophomore guard Dion Waiters sank two free throws to tie the game at 61-61, and, with 29 seconds remaining Orange senior forward Kris Joseph, who finished with 29 points, hit a decisive three-pointer to give Syracuse a 64–61 win and a 48–39 advantage in the all-time series with the Hoyas. In a losing cause, the Hoya defense held Syracuse to 34.9 percent shooting from the field and Georgetown outrebounded the Orange 52–35, while Syracuse held Georgetown, second in the Big East in three-point shooting, to 5-for-21 (23.8 percent) from three-point range. Hollis Thompson (10 points and 10 rebounds) and Otto Porter (14 points and 13 rebounds) both had double-doubles, and Jason Clark scored 12 points. The Orange's victory was the 880th career win for Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim, moving him past North Carolina′s Dean Smith into third place in career wins.\nThe Hoyas went 3–1 in their next four games, winning rematches with St. John's and at Providence, suffering an upset loss at Seton Hall, and defeating Villanova. The Hoyas had a balanced attack against the Red Storm, with Greg Whittington finishing with a team-high 12 points, Jason Clark, Otto Porter, and Markel Starks each scoring 11, Hollis Thompson adding 10 and Henry Sims nine, and Nate Lubick having an excellent all-around game with seven points, eight rebounds, five assists, and a career-high four blocked shots. The Hoyas, still the second-stingiest defensive team in the Big East (allowing 58.9 points per game), held Providence to 25.9 percent shooting from the field, the fourth time in five games they had held an opponent to making fewer than 35 percent of its shots, and moved into sole possession of third place in the conference standings by defeating the Friars; Hollis Thompson had a double-double against the Friars with 13 points and 10 rebounds, while Jason Clark also scored 13 and Henry Sims added 10. Allowing only 38.4 percent shooting overall and 27.6 in three-pointers by opponents on the season entering the Seton Hall game, Georgetown had its worst defensive performance of the year, allowing the Pirates to shoot 61.0 percent overall and 61.5 percent from three-point range; Greg Whittington's nine points led the Hoyas in the first game of the season in which no Georgetown player scored in double digits. The Hoyas recovered on both defense and offense against Villanova, limiting the Wildcats to 28 percent shooting from the field and outrebounding them 43–25 in a win that moved the Hoyas into sole possession of fourth place in the Big East; four Hoyas scored in double digits against the Wildcats, with Jason Clark and Otto Porter each finishing with 15, Henry Sims with 12, and Hollis Thompson with 10 points. The Hoyas rose to No. 10 in the AP Poll after beating St. John's and to No. 9 after the win at Providence, although the loss at Seton Hall prompted a drop to No. 11 after the Villanova game.\nThe Hoyas closed out their regular season with two games against ranked opponents. In the first, against No. 20 Notre Dame at the Verizon Center, the teams combined to make eight of their first 12 shots, then combined to make only three of their next 16. The Hoyas had a 7–0 run to take an 18–11 lead, the last two of those points on a layup by Henry Sims that started a stretch in which he scored or assisted on the next 10 Georgetown points, giving the Hoyas a 26–18 lead. Georgetown led 28–18 at halftime and continued to pull away in the second half, including a 9–0 run that gave the Hoyas a 48–29 lead with about minutes to play, and cruised to a 59–41 victory. The Hoyas held the Fighting Irish to 33 percent shooting overall and 3-for-17 (17.6%) from three-point range, with no Notre Dame player scoring in double digits, and the Fighting Irish scored their fewest points in a game since a 61–41 loss to Washington State on March 22, 2008, in the 2008 NCAA tournament. In their final home game, Henry Sims and Jason Clark scored 13 and 12 points, respectively, and each grabbed six rebounds, while Greg Whittington came off the bench to add 15 points.\nNo. 11 Georgetown completed the regular season by going on the road for a rematch with Marquette, now ranked No. 8. The Golden Eagles overwhelmed Georgetown's strong defense with their transition game, outscoring the Hoyas 24-8 off of turnovers and making 33 out of 45 foul shots (73.3%). Marquette led 39–29 at halftime, and began the second half with a 9–2 run to take a 48–31 lead with 17:55 left to play. The Hoyas cut the lead to 51–43 with 14:31 left, but the Golden Eagles then extended their lead to 67–53 with 6:33 remaining. Although the Hoyas soon cut the lead to nine, Marquette led by 11 with a little under four minutes left in the game and went on to win 83–69. Hollis Thompson and Otto Porter each scored 19 points, but Jason Clark shot 4-for-14 (28.6%) from the field and finished with 11 points and Henry Sims fouled out with 9:33 remaining in the game after grabbing nine rebounds but scoring only five points. The Hoyas finished the Big East season at 12–6, in a three-way tie for third place, and with an overall record of 22–7.\nBig East tournament.\nAlthough the loss to Marquette in the regular-season finale denied Georgetown a double bye in the 2012 Big East tournament, the Hoyas were seeded fifth and earned a bye in the first round. In the second round – now ranked No. 13 in the AP Poll after the\nMarquette loss – they faced the 13th seed, Pittsburgh, which had upset 12th-seeded St. John's the previous day to advance to meet Georgetown. Georgetown entered the game as the second-best defensive team in the Big East, allowing opponents only 59 points a game on the season, and held the Panthers scoreless during two separate eight-minute stretches of the game. The Hoyas closed the first half with a decisive 16–2 run that gave them a 31–23 lead at halftime, and, beginning with six straight points by Otto Porter, had a 9–1 run in the second half that extended their lead to 53–39 with 8:46 to play. The Hoyas′ last score of the game came with 2:55 left on two Henry Sims free throws that extended Georgetown's advantage to 64–45. The Panthers then finished the game with a 7–0 run that fell well short of challenging the Hoyas′ lead, and Georgetown won 64–52. Georgetown outrebounded Pittsburgh 36-25 and shot 19-of-39 (48.7%) from the field and 22-of-31 (71.0%) from the free-throw line, while the Panthers went 11-of-18 (61.1%) in free throws. Henry Sims shot 7-for-10 (70.0%) from the field and had a double-double (20 points and 13 rebounds) as well as five assists, and Otto Porter also scored 20 on 7-for-11 (63.6%) shooting, while Greg Whittington added 11 points. It was the 17th time during the season that the Hoyas held an opponent to under 60 points.\nAdvancing to the quarterfinals, Georgetown faced the No. 4 seed, Cincinnati, the following day. A dramatic narrative of the game was the duel underneath the baskets between the teams′ two senior \"big men,\" Henry Sims and Cincinnati forward Yancy Gates. The first half was close, although Georgetown pulled away in the final five minutes to lead 30–24 at halftime. In the second half, an 8-0 Georgetown run extended the Hoyas′ lead to 49–38, but the Bearcats responded with an 11–3 run that cut Georgetown's lead to 52–49 with 3:53 remaining in regulation. Gates scored over Sims on a layup with 1:56 remaining to narrow the gap to 52–51, then tipped in a miss by Cincinnati junior guard Cashmere Wright to give the Bearcats their first lead of the second half at 53–52 with 37 seconds left. After Cincinnati senior guard Dion Dixon sank the first of two free throws to extend his team's lead to 54-52 but missed his second shot, Otto Porter grabbed the rebound and scored on a jumper with four seconds remaining to tie the game at 54-54 and force overtime. In overtime, Cincinnati staked itself to a 62–60 lead on a Dixon free throw with 20 seconds left, but Henry Sims, finding himself at the top of the key with the ball and with time running out, drove in toward the basket and made a layup at the buzzer to force a second overtime with the score tied 62-62. The teams traded baskets in the second overtime, and Sims tied it with a two-point jumper at 70–70 with 29 seconds to play, but Wright countered with a jumper 20 seconds later to give the Bearcats a 72–70 advantage. On the next possession, Sims missed a three-point attempt from way out of range at the buzzer, and Cincinnati won 72-70 despite shooting 2-for-21 (9.5%) in three-pointers. Sims led the Hoyas with a double-double (22 points and 15 rebounds), while Otto Porter added 14 points and grabbed seven rebounds, Jason Clark scored 12 points, and Hollis Thompson finished with 10. It was the first multiple-overtime game for the Hoyas since January 24, 2006, and the first one in the Big East tournament since Syracuse beat Connecticut in six overtimes in the 2009 quarterfinals. The Bearcats advanced to upset Syracuse in the semifinals and then to the championship game, where they lost to Louisville.\nNCAA tournament.\nDropping to No. 15 in the AP Poll but with a record of 23–8, Georgetown earned a bid in the 2012 NCAA tournament, the Hoyas′ third consecutive appearance in the tournament and sixth in seven seasons. Seeded third in the Midwest Region, in the Round of 64 – termed the \"Second Round\" of the tournament that year – they met 14th-seeded Belmont, the regular-season champion of the Atlantic Sun Conference and winner of the 2012 Atlantic Sun tournament, with Country Music Hall of Fame member Vince Gill looking on from the front row of the Belmont cheering section. The Bruins entered the game with a 14-game winning streak, but Georgetown dominated them with its defense and inside game. The Hoyas led 36–27 at halftime and never let the Bruins get closer than six points for the rest of the game. After Belmont closed to 58–49 with just under six minutes left in the game, the Hoyas went on a 13–2 run to ensure a 74–59 victory. Belmont made just 10 of their 27 three-point attempts (37.0%), while Georgetown shot 61 percent from the floor for the game and 70 percent in the second half. Jason Clark led the Hoyas with 21 points, Otto Porter scored 16 points and pulled down eight rebounds, and Henry Sims finished with 15 points. Belmont's winning streak came to an end, and the Bruins fell to 0-5 all time in NCAA tournament play. It was the first time the Hoyas had won an NCAA tournament game since the first game of the 2008 tournament, and only the second Georgetown NCAA tournament victory since the Final Four season of 2006–07, despite four appearances in the tournament over that span.\nTwo days later, Georgetown met the Midwest Region's 11th seed, North Carolina State, in the Round of 32, termed the \"Third Round\" that year. The Wolfpack had upset the region's sixth seed, San Diego State, to advance to meet the Hoyas. North Carolina State mounted a strong defensive effort and, down by eight points in the first half, had a 12–0 run that put them ahead 30–27 at the half. In the second half, the Wolfpack extended their lead to 11 points and got Henry Sims into foul trouble before the Hoyas mounted a strong comeback, closing to 63-61 before Otto Porter missed a potential game-tying two-point jumper with 14 seconds left. North Carolina State guard Lorenzo Brown then hit two free throws to extend the Wolfpack's lead to 65–61 with 10.6 seconds to play. With 4.6 seconds left, Brown hit one of two free throws but missed the second, leaving the door open for Georgetown to tie the game with a last-second three-pointer. Jason Clark got the ball and launched the last shot of his collegiate career, a hurried three-point attempt, but it missed, and North Carolina State ended Georgetown's season with a 66–63 upset victory. Hollis Thompson finished with 23 points, Clark had 10, and Otto Porter scored nine points and grabbed eight rebounds. For the fourth straight time, the Hoyas exited the NCAA tournament in its first weekend due to an upset by a lower-seeded opponent. The Wolfpack, meanwhile, advanced to the region semifinal, which they lost to Kansas.\nWrap-up.\nJason Clark, who started all 33 games during the season, finished the year with a team-leading 14 points per game on 47.6 percent shooting from the field and 75 percent from the free-throw line, and he was fourth in rebounds with 4.1 per game. Also starting every game, Hollis Thompson finished second on the team with an average of 12.8 points per game on 46.4 shooting from the field overall, and he led the Big East in three-point shooting at 43.0 percent and was third on the team in rebounds with 5.5 per game; he was an honorable-mention all-conference pick. Henry Sims, who also started all 33 games, had a break-out year, averaging 11.6 points per game with a field-goal percentage of 46.2 and a free-throw percentage of 70.8, and he was second on the team with 6.0 rebounds per game. Otto Porter only started eight games but played in all 33 and led the team in field-goal percentage (52.5%) and rebounds (6.8) while averaging 9.7 points per game. Markel Starks, starting 25 of the 31 games he played in, averaged 7.1 points per game on 45.5 percent shooting. Nate Lubick started all 33 games and averaged 3.5 points per game, while Greg Whittington appeared in all 33 and averaged 4.3 points. Mikeal Hopkins played in 30 games, averaging 2.4 points.\nAfter the season, Jason Clark and Henry Sims graduated. Clark had played in all 130 games of his collegiate career, starting every game in his sophomore, junior, and senior years; he averaged 10.5 points per game on 48.0 percent field-goal shooting over his four-year career. He went on to play professional basketball in Europe. Sims played as a reserve in his first three seasons, skewing his overall career statistics, but he started every game in his senior year, and it was far and away his best season. Over his 121-game college career, he averaged 4.9 points per game on 47.9 percent shooting from the field, and he pulled down an average of 3.2 rebounds per game. He went undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft, but later signed with several National Basketball Association teams, beginning with the New York Knicks. Hollis Thompson announced on March 27, 2012, that he would not return to Georgetown for his senior year the following season and would enter the 2012 NBA draft; he left Georgetown having played 99 games, 57 as a starter, with a career average of 8.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, and 24.6 minutes per game, shooting 47.8 percent overall from the field, and his three-point shooting percentage of 44 percent was the best in school history. He went undrafted in the NBA draft, but signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder in July 2012 and with the Philadelphia 76ers in September 2013. He was the twelfth Hoya player in seven seasons to leave the team prior to the end of his college eligibility.\nConsistently mounting one of the top defenses in the Big East, the 2011-12 Hoyas were an overachieving team that finished much higher in the Big East than projected and won Georgetown's first NCAA tournament game in four years despite a youthful roster that included 10 freshmen and sophomores. However, they also continued the disappointing streak of early Georgetown exits from the NCAA tournament at the hands of underdog teams. They finished with a record of 24–9, and their final ranking was No. 15 in the AP Poll and No. 17 in the Coaches Poll.\nRankings.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Goodwill tour of China (Exhibition)\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Penn–Princeton men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Penn–Princeton men's basketball rivalry is an American college basketball rivalry between the Penn Quakers men's basketball team of the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton Tigers men's basketball team of Princeton University. Having been contested every year since 1903, it is the third oldest consecutively played rivalry in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I history. Unlike many notable college basketball rivalries, such as Carolina–Duke, which involves teams that often both get invited to the same NCAA tournaments, Notre Dame–UCLA, which involves geographically remote teams, Illinois–Missouri, which involves non-conference rivals, or Alabama–Auburn, which takes a back seat to the football rivalry, this is a rivalry of geographically close, conference rivals, who compete for a single NCAA invitation and consider the basketball rivalry more important than other sports rivalries between the schools. A head-to-head contest has been the final regularly scheduled game of the Princeton season every year since 1995. Between 1963 and 2007, Princeton or Penn won or shared the Ivy League conference championship every season except 1986 and 1988. The other seasons in which neither team won or shared the Ivy League title are 1957, 1958, 1962, 2008–10, and 2012-2016. \nThe two programs are omnipresent in the history of Ivy League basketball. Entering the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, 11 of the 12 active Division I basketball head coaches who are Ivy basketball alumni are from these two programs: Penn – Jerome Allen (Penn), Matt Langel (Colgate), Fran McCaffery (Iowa) and Andrew Toole (Robert Morris); Princeton – Mitch Henderson (Princeton), Sydney Johnson (Fairfield), Chris Mooney (Richmond), Craig Robinson (Oregon State), Joe Scott (Denver), John Thompson III (Georgetown) and Mike Brennan (American).\nPenn and Princeton have each won 26 conference championships. Princeton has been undefeated in conference 5 times: 1968–69, 1975–76, 1990–91, 1996–97 &amp; 1997–98. Penn has been undefeated in conference 7 times: 1969–70, 1970–71, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1999–2000 &amp; 2002–03. Four one-loss Penn teams suffered their only conference loss to Princeton: 1971–72, 1974–75, 1980–81 &amp; 1998–99. The following one-loss Princeton teams suffered their only conference loss to Penn 1976–77, 1980–81 and 2003–04. Note that in the 1980–81 season both teams had one loss, and Princeton won a one-game playoff for the NCAA invitation. Also, in 1996 when both teams had two losses, the 1995–96 Tigers suffered their only conference losses to the 1995–96 Quakers, and Princeton won a one-game playoff for the automatic NCAA invitation.\nBoth Penn and Princeton have earned 24 bids each as Ivy League conference's bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Both teams have advanced to the NCAA tournament final four once: 1964–65 Tigers and 1978–79 Quakers. Additionally, the 1974–75 Tigers won the 1975 National Invitation Tournament championship.\n\"Black Tuesday\" - February 9, 1999.\nPrinceton 50,\nPenn 49\nAfter Princeton's Brian Earl opened the scoring with a three-pointer, Penn scored 29 unanswered points to stake a 29-3 lead. The Quakers led 33-9 at the break and 40-13 in the second half. But Princeton closed the game on a 37-9 run to score a stunning 50-49 victory and move into first place in the Ivy League. As of 2010, the 27-point comeback from 13–40 with 15:11 remaining to win 50–49 over Penn on February 9, 1999, remains the fifth-largest comeback and fourth-largest second-half comeback in NCAA history. That game's 9–33 half time deficit comeback remains the second-largest comeback.\nRecent games.\nThe 2010–11 Tigers needed to beat the 2010–11 Quakers in the season-ending rivalry game to tie the 2010–11 Harvard Crimson for the regular season co-championship and necessitate a one-game playoff for the conference's automatic NCAA tournament invitation. Princeton won.\nThe 2011–12 Quakers needed a victory over the 2011–12 Tigers in the season-ending rivalry game to tie the 2011–12 Crimson for the regular season co-championship and necessitate a one-game playoff for the conference's automatic NCAA tournament invitation. Penn lost.\nThe first game of the 2017 Ivy League men's basketball tournament, which was the inaugural Ivy League men's basketball tournament was an overtime victory by Princeton over Penn."

        "text": "The Pakistan national cricket team toured Bangladesh from 29 November to 21 December 2011. The tour consisted of one Twenty20 International (T20I), three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Test matches, all of which were won by Pakistan.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nBangladesh recalled 56-Test veteran and former captain Mohammad Ashraful to their side for the first Test in Chittagong; he had been dropped for the series against the West Indies earlier in the year. Nazimuddin, the captain of Chittagong Division, was selected to make his Test debut.\nPakistan won the toss and decided to bowl. Their bowlers duly tore through Bangladesh's batting lineup, bowling them out for 135 before the tea break on the first day. Debutant opener Nazimuddin was Bangladesh's longest-lasting batsman, surviving for 78 balls before being dismissed by Umar Gul for 31. All-rounder Nasir Hossain, batting at number eight, top scored with 41. Only one other batsman scored more than 10 runs. Pakistan's front-line bowlers shared the wickets: Abdur Rehman and Saeed Ajmal took three each; Gul and Aizaz Cheema took two.\nPakistan ended the first day on 132 runs for the loss of no wickets, thanks to an opening stand between Mohammad Hafeez and Taufeeq Umar. It was the 21st consecutive Test in which Hafeez and Taufeeq had opened for Pakistan, a record for the team. Taufeeq was dismissed the next morning, leg before wicket to Mahmudullah; Hafeez went on to score his fourth Test century, eventually falling for 143 runs. Pakistan continued to pile on the runs with another large partnership, a fifth-wicket stand of 259 runs between Younus Khan and Asad Shafiq over the Test's second and third days. Shafiq scored his first Test century before being dismissed for 104; Younus scored his third Test double century. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq declared with Younus not out for 200 and Pakistan at 594/5.\nBangladesh, needing 459 runs simply to force Pakistan to bat again, improved on their first innings total, but were dismissed for 275. Nazimuddin top-scored with 78, while Shakib Al Hasan also scored a half-century (51 off 69 balls). Rehman took four wickets, giving him seven for the match. Pakistan thus won by an innings and 184 runs. Younus was named player of the match.\n2nd Test.\nBangladesh selectors dropped Mohammad Ashraful from the team after scoring only one run in the first Test. Bowlers Nazmul Hossain and Robiul Islam were brought into the side; fellow paceman Rubel Hossain was ruled out due to a shoulder injury. Pakistan entered the Test with an unchanged team.\nPakistan won the toss and put Bangladesh into bat. After their low first innings in the first Test, Bangladesh's top order again fell quickly, sitting at 4/34 after Aizaz Cheema took three wickets. However, Shahriar Nafees and Shakib Al Hasan combined for a 180-run partnership, a record fifth-wicket stand for Bangladesh. Shahriar, under pressure to retain his position in the team, scored 97. By the end of the first day's play, Shakib had scored his second Test century. Shakib was run out the next morning for his highest Test score of 144, before Bangladesh's tail was dismissed quickly, leaving the team all out for 338. Cheema and Umar Gul took three wickets each.\nPakistan finished the second day of the test at 1/87. The following day, their batsmen accumulated runs carefully, with six out of their top seven batsmen scoring at least 40. Taufeeq Umar was the stand-out, with 130. They batted into the fourth day of the match, being bowled out for 470, raising the prospect of a drawn result. Shakib followed up his century in Bangladesh's first innings by taking six of Pakistan's wickets, becoming his country's first player to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test.\nBangladesh needed 132 runs to force Pakistan to bat again. They ended the fourth day of the match at 5/114, leaving Pakistan just five wickets from victory on the Test's final day. A partnership between Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim and Nasir Hossain lasting for the whole of the day's first session gave Bangladesh a chance of drawing the match, but Abdur Rehman and Saeed Ajmal's spin bowled Bangladesh out in the second session, leaving Pakistan needing just over 100 runs in fading light to win the match. Pakistan reached the target at a rate of over five runs per over, sealing a 2–0 series win. Shakib was named player of the match."

On March 9, 2020, Biega signed a one-year contract extension with the Red Wings. During the pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, Biega was placed on waivers for the purpose of transferring him to the Red Wings' taxi squad. He finished the season with 3 points in 13 games with the Red Wings.\nOn July 28, 2021, having left the Red Wings as a free agent, Biega was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Biega saw little action with the Maple Leafs, playing in only two games. He made his debut for the Maple Leafs on January 1, 2022 against the Ottawa Senators. He played in 31 games with the Maple Leafs AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. On March 21, 2022, Biega was traded to the Nashville Predators for future considerations. He was assigned to the Predators' AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals.\nOn December 19, 2022 Biega announced his retirement from professional hockey.\nPersonal life.\nBiega's brother, Danny Biega, was also a professional ice hockey player who last played for the Carolina Hurricanes. He also has two other brothers, Marc and Michael. Alex, Danny, and Michael all played hockey for Harvard University, becoming the first trio of brothers since 2000 to play for Harvard.\nBiega met his wife Diana while in Boston. They had a son together in April 2015. While with the Vancouver Canucks, Biega became involved with the National Hockey League Players Association's Core Development Program, which helps former NHL players transition from their hockey careers post retirement, helping to develop the program."

        "text": "James Brian Johnson (November 3, 1945 – December 6, 1987) was an American professional baseball player. A left-handed pitcher, he appeared in three Major League games during the early days of the season as a member of the San Francisco Giants. Born in Muskegon, Michigan, he stood tall and weighed .\nAn alumnus of Western Michigan University, he entered professional baseball after being selected by the Giants in the third round of the secondary phase of the June 1967 Major League Baseball draft. After three years of seasoning in the Giants' farm system, he made the early-season roster of the 1970 Giants.\nHis three MLB appearances all came in relief. In his debut, April 13 at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, he took over from Giants' starting pitcher Frank Reberger in the first inning with the Giants trailing 4–0. He pitched creditably and held the Giants close until the fourth inning, when Atlanta reached him for five hits and five earned runs en route to a 9–3 Braves' triumph. In his second appearance, three days later against the Houston Astros, Johnson worked two hitless innings but his three bases on balls resulted in another earned run charged against his record; however, the Giants won that contest 11–9.\nFinally, on April 18, 1970, Johnson again relieved Reberger after the starter experienced a tough outing. Entering the game against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field in the fourth inning, Johnson allowed three inherited runners to score, but eventually stopped a Cincinnati rally with the Reds' leading 8–3. Johnson then pitched a scoreless fifth inning and exited for a pinch hitter in the top of the sixth; but in that inning, San Francisco rallied for seven runs and eventually won 16–9, earning Johnson the victory.\nHe then was returned the Giants' minor league system and he retired after the 1970 season. In the Majors, he allowed eight hits, six earned runs, and five bases on balls, while recording two strikeouts.\nJohnson became an educator after leaving baseball, and in 1983 he was named superintendent of schools in North Muskegon, Michigan. Four years later, he died from cancer at the age of 42."

        "title": "History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)",
        "text": "The Texas Rangers Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise was established in 1961 as the second incarnation of the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after the old Washington Senators team of the American League moved to Minnesota and became the Twins. The new Senators remained in Washington through 1971 playing at Griffith Stadium in their first season and at RFK Stadium for the next 10 years. In 1972, the team moved to Arlington, Texas, where it became the Texas Rangers. The Rangers played at Arlington Stadium from 1972 to 1993. Arlington Stadium was demolished, and the new Ballpark at Arlington was built, opening in 1994. The Ballpark at Arlington was renamed Globe Life Park in Arlington in 2014.\nIt took the team 36 seasons to make the playoffs and they have made nine appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a wild card team in 2012 and 2023. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. The team then brought home their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games. In the 2010 World Series, the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the 2011 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The team won the 2023 World Series, effectively ending the longest drought amongst all North American pro sports franchises that are yet to win their first championship. The Rangers are in the American League West Division along with the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, Los Angeles Angels and the Houston Astros.\nWashington Senators: 1961–1971.\nWhen the original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota in 1960 as the Twins, Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off threats of losing its exemption from the Sherman Antitrust Act. At the winter meetings that year, it awarded a new team to Los Angeles (the Angels) as well as a new team in the nation's capital. This new team adopted the old Senators name, but was (and still is) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an expansion draft. The team played the season at old Griffith Stadium before moving to District of Columbia Stadium (now the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium). \nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators—\"Washington: first in war, first in peace and \"still\" last in the American League.\" Frank Howard, known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Owner Pete Queseda once wondered why he needed to pay players who did not belong in the majors and later agreed to a ten-year lease at D.C. Stadium—a move that would come back to haunt the Senators. In , Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers James Johnston and James Lemon owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnston died in and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive Bob Short, who outbid a group headed by Bob Hope. Short named himself general manager and hired Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager. Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept them in contention for most of the 1969 season, bringing them in at 86–76 for fourth place in the AL East. Attendance surged to over 918,000, at the time the highest in Washington baseball history.\nHowever, this would not last. Short had borrowed most of the $9.4 million he had paid for the team. Serving as his own general manager, Short was forced to make many questionable trades to service the debt and bring in much-needed revenue. As a result, the team rapidly fell back into the American League's cellar. Moreover, like their predecessors in their final few years in the nation's capital, the new Senators had to compete for an audience with the Baltimore Orioles, to the northeast, who by the 1960s were perennial contenders. Fans kept their distance from the Senators while the Orioles won four American League pennants and two World Series from 1966 through 1971. As it turned out, the 1969 season would be the only time the franchise would manage so much as a .500 record in its first 12 years. As well, the Senators would never approach their 1969 gate again during their stay in Washington; it would remain the franchise record for attendance until 1974–the franchise's fourth year in Texas.\nBy the end of the season, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (in comparison, the New York Yankees were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and move the team elsewhere. At that season's end, Short dealt his best starting pitcher and the left side of his infield to the Detroit Tigers for erstwhile 30-game-winner Denny McLain, who had spent most of the 1970 campaign suspended because of gambling allegations. The deal—alleged by onetime Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield to have been made in order to secure the Tigers' vote in favor of the Senators' eventual move to Texas—turned Detroit back into contenders, while McLain was a monumental bust, losing a league-worst 22 games.\nShort was especially receptive to an offer from Arlington, Texas mayor Tom Vandergriff, who had been trying to get a Major League team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Kansas City Athletics, sought to move his team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed by the other AL team owners.\nArlington's hole card was Turnpike Stadium, a 10,000-seat park which had been built in to house the AA Dallas–Fort Worth Spurs of the Texas League. However, it had been built to Major League specifications. It was also located in a natural bowl, meaning only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate Major League crowds.\nAfter Vandergriff offered a multimillion-dollar down payment, Short decided to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, (by a vote of 10–2, the Orioles' Jerold Hoffberger and John Allyn of the Chicago White Sox registering the dissenting votes), American League owners granted approval for the season.\nSenators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7–5 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed first base and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, umpire crew chief Jim Honochick forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.\nEven after the move, the Rangers retained the rights to the Senators name, which meant the current Washington team, who relocated from Montreal in , would revive another longtime name, the Nationals (which was used by several NL teams in the 19th century, as well as the from 1905 to 1955). However, the Rangers allowed the Nationals to use the curly W logo that originated with the expansion Senators.\nNaming of the Rangers.\nAfter moving from Washington, the Senators were renamed after the Texas Rangers, the state-wide investigative law-enforcement agency which was founded by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 when Texas was part of Mexico, and whose mythology led to fictional characters such as The Lone Ranger and Walker, Texas Ranger.\nFirst years in Texas: 1972–1984.\nDuring the off-season, improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as Arlington Stadium for the 1972 season. Meanwhile, ownership announced that the franchise would be renamed the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1–0 loss at the California Angels. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5–1 for the club's first victory. After the season Ted Williams retired as manager; he had made no secret of his displeasure with the franchise's new location. Whitey Herzog was named the new manager, but he was replaced before the end of the 1973 season by Billy Martin.\nIn 1974, the Rangers began to come into their own as a team. They finished the season second in the American League West with an 84–76 record, behind the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics. The 1974 Rangers are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. Mike Hargrove was awarded A.L. Rookie of the Year, Billy Martin was named Manager of the Year, Jeff Burroughs won American League MVP, and Ferguson Jenkins was named the Comeback Player of the Year after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. However, after a 44–51 start in 1975, Martin was fired as the Rangers' manager and was replaced by Frank Lucchesi.\nAfter excellent seasons between 1977 and 1979, the Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in the first half of 1981. But when Texas lost its last game before the players' strike began, the Oakland A's won the AL West in the first half by a half-game. After 1981, the Rangers would not post another winning record for five seasons. During this stretch, the Rangers made one of their most unpopular trades ever, sending multi-Gold Glove catcher and fan favorite Jim Sundberg to the Milwaukee Brewers for future Brewers’ manager Ned Yost, who later managed the Kansas City Royals to the 2015 World Series championship.\nThe Rangers faced attendance problems for a few years after moving to Texas, in part due to the team's inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity that can overtake the area in the summer. Until the Florida (now Miami) Marlins arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, with temperatures frequently topping throughout the summer months. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even their weekend games between May and September at night—a tradition that continued until the opening of retractable-roofed Globe Life Field in 2020. Beginning in 1990, the Rangers usually received a waiver from ESPN to play Sunday night games and televise them in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\nThe Valentine, Ryan, and Bush years: 1985–1994.\nBobby Valentine, who would eventually become the Rangers' longest-serving manager at 1,186 games, took on the managerial reins of the team late in the 1985 season and became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of many stellar young rookies such as Rubén Sierra, Pete Incaviglia, Mitch Williams, Bobby Witt, and Edwin Correa, the Rangers finished in 2nd place with an 87–75 record, just five games behind the division champion California Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in a yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher Nolan Ryan prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th strikeout, 300th win, and sixth and seventh no-hitters with the Rangers before his long career ended in 1993. Coupled with powerful batters like Juan González, Rubén Sierra, Julio Franco, and Rafael Palmeiro and a pitching staff that also included Charlie Hough, Bobby Witt, Kevin Brown, and Kenny Rogers, fans held high expectations for the Rangers. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon Eddie Chiles, sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush, son of the President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed a group of investors that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was a small one (about ten percent), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year.\nDuring his tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named Choctaw Stadium), which would open in 1994. The city, through the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority, also controversially authorized the seizure of of land through eminent domain for the Rangers future development. Landowners filed lawsuits over the acquisition and eventually won settlements of $22.2 million which the Rangers failed to pay.\nBush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected Governor of Texas in 1994, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States in 2000. Although Bush no longer has any ownership stake in the Rangers, he remains a fan of the team to this day and regularly attends the team's home games.\nIn 1993, Kevin Kennedy took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the A.L. West (with a 52–62 record) prior to the players' strike. The strike prematurely ended what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when commissioner Bud Selig canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Regardless of the unceremonious end to the 1994 season, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th perfect game in Major League history on July 28.\nFirst success: 1995–2000.\nThe year 1995 saw the beginnings of promise for the Rangers. With a brand new ballpark that hosted its first All-Star Game that year, Johnny Oates was hired as the Rangers' manager. Oates and company promptly helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division championship, the first division championship in team history, finally reaching the playoffs in the franchise's 36th season, taking longer than any other team in North American professional sports history to accomplish the feat, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas. The series ultimately saw the Rangers lose to the burgeoning late-1990s New York Yankees, three games to one. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and Juan González was named A.L. MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters with Iván Rodríguez, Will Clark, Mark McLemore, Dean Palmer, Rusty Greer, Juan González, and Mickey Tettleton but continued to struggle with pitching—a common stereotype of Rangers teams—despite having Rick Helling, and Aaron Sele on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive A.L. West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three world championships in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team would be the last playoff-bound team for over a decade, as the Rangers took a step backwards at the beginning of the new millennium. En route to a second straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28 games into the 2001 season. The Rangers finished the decade going 1–9 in the postseason, without a single home win.\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire Tom Hicks bought the team for $250 million. Hicks also agreed to pay the $22.2 million awarded in settlements in relation to the 1991 eminent domain litigation concerning the Ballpark in Arlington.\nThe lean years: 2001–2004.\nThe A-Rod era: 2001–2003.\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez, was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a ten-year, $252 million contract. The move was considered controversial and was frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager Jerry Narron was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager Buck Showalter.\nThe 2003 season signified the fourth straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning A.L. MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and infielder prospect Joaquin Arias.\nIn the spring of 2009, Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers. During the investigations into PED use earlier in the decade, several other former Rangers players were criticized for possible use of performance-enhancers. These included notable '90s sluggers Jose Canseco, Iván Rodríguez, Juan González, and Rafael Palmeiro.\n2004.\nPrior to the 2004 season, little hope was held out for the Rangers to improve on their losing ways. However, the Rangers battled with the Anaheim Angels and Oakland Athletics for first place in the American League West for much of the season. Mark Teixeira, Alfonso Soriano, Michael Young, and Hank Blalock became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano were named to the 2004 All-Star Game. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2for3 with a three-run home run. Late in September, the Oakland Athletics visited Arlington for a three-game series. After taking the first two games of the series, the Rangers trailed 4–2, in the bottom of the ninth. A loss would have dropped them to four games behind the Athletics. A home run by Hank Blalock and a dramatic two-out, two-run double by David Dellucci (known amongst fans as the \"Dellucci Double\") gave the Rangers a 5–4 win, one of the most memorable in club history. It also allowed the Rangers to sweep the first-place Athletics and leave them just two games behind with ten to play. Unfortunately, the Rangers ended up losing six of the final ten games and another turnaround season came up short. The club finished in third place behind the Angels and Athletics, a mere three games out of first place.\n2005–2009.\n2005.\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that the team swept an entire homestand for the first time in its history. Frank Francisco and Carlos Almanzar, two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined for Tommy John surgery. Kenny Rogers, the team's ace pitcher, received a 20-game suspension from commissioner Bud Selig for attacking a cameraman at Ameriquest Field prior to a game. Management later placed opening day starter Ryan Drese on waivers, where he was claimed by the Washington Nationals. After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1–12 August road trip all but sealed the squad's fate.\nOn October 4, 2005, the Rangers announced that John Hart would step down as general manager and that Jon Daniels was being promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, would become the youngest general manager in Major League history.\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in the 2005–06 offseason. Alfonso Soriano, who had often been mentioned in trade speculation, was finally dealt to the Nationals for outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel Sledge. The Rangers then began making moves to acquire pitching talent. The Rangers gained enigmatic starter Vicente Padilla from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Ricardo Rodríguez and acquired San Diego Padres pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka in exchange for Chris Young, Adrián González, and Sledge. Finally, they signed free agent starter Kevin Millwood to a five-year contract worth $60 million.\n2006: Building the brand.\nThe Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80–82 record and a third-place finish in the American League West. Though the club showed strength in the early going, the team proved unable to keep pace with the surging Oakland Athletics in the second half and fell out of contention in September. To some extent the Rangers were the victims of bad luck, as their win–loss record was worse than their +51 run differential for the season would normally indicate. However, the element the club continued to lack was a solid pitching staff, whose combined ERA ranked 9th in the American League at the season's end. The Rangers were represented in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game by center fielder Gary Matthews, Jr. and shortstop Michael Young, who was named the MVP for his game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning.\nSignificant player moves in-season included a July 28 deal acquiring outfielders Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero, and Laynce Nix.\nOn October 4 after two attempts to replicate the success of the 2004 team, the Rangers dismissed Buck Showalter as manager with three years left on his contract. A month later, the team announced that Oakland Athletics third base coach Ron Washington had accepted their offer to manage the team. A change at manager would be the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy off-season.\nGary Matthews, Jr., Mark DeRosa, Carlos Lee, and Adam Eaton all signed with other clubs as free agents. Vicente Padilla accepted a three-year, $33 million offer with an option for a fourth year at $12 million. The Rangers also signed first baseman/outfielder Frank Catalanotto to a multi-year deal. The Rangers later added reliever Éric Gagné and veteran outfielders Kenny Lofton and Sammy Sosa on short-term deals. In a sign that general manager Jon Daniels was looking for results in 2007, the Rangers' top pitching prospect John Danks was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with reliever Nick Masset for 23-year-old starter Brandon McCarthy. The Danks trade caused quite a stir amongst fans, many of which had followed the minor league careers of the highly touted \"DVD\" trio of pitchers that included Danks, Edinson Vólquez, and Thomas Diamond. All three pitchers would eventually reach the majors, with varying degrees of success, while McCarthy's career became marred by injury.\nThe Rangers previously negotiated a 30-year, $75 million stadium naming rights agreement with Ameriquest Mortgage Company in 2004, renaming the Ballpark \"Ameriquest Field\". Under the Ameriquest moniker, the Ballpark featured a replica of the Liberty Bell in the stands above the Diamond Club (representing Ameriquest's logo) that rang after home runs. In 2007, though, the Rangers announced the termination of the agreement with Ameriquest, and changed the name to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Club president Jeff Cogen cited that the team was more concerned about getting their name back on the ballpark than Ameriquest's public financial troubles. \"It's all about the brand\", Cogen said. The Rangers lost a reported $2.5 million per year from the lack of naming rights but regained advertising space given over to Ameriquest in the naming rights deal. Regardless of Cogen's comments, Ameriquest dissolved within months after the naming rights were terminated, and the company ended most business operations in September 2007.\n2007–2009: Financial troubles.\nThe Rangers struggled offensively early in the season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. On June 20, Sammy Sosa hit his 600th career home run against the Chicago Cubs at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Hank Blalock, the starting 3rd baseman who had been enjoying a good season, was placed on the 60-day disabled list on May 19 due to thoracic outlet syndrome, and Mark Teixeira followed him onto the disabled list on June9 (for the first time in his career) with a strained left quadriceps muscle. With a record of 46–59 at the July 31 trade deadline, the team traded Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay to the Atlanta Braves in a deal that would eventually bring five prospects to the Rangers organization, including four of Atlanta's top prospects Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Elvis Andrus, Matt Harrison, and Neftalí Feliz. The team also traded closer Éric Gagné to the Boston Red Sox for left-hander Kason Gabbard and Minor League outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre. These moves were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. The objective of Daniels' plan was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\nThe 2007 season remains notable in the minds of baseball fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, on August 22, in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 30–3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League history—entering the game in the bottom of the seventh, with his team already ahead 14–3, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk.\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season red hot, headlined by newcomer Josh Hamilton who looked to be a threat to win the Triple Crown, before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at Yankee Stadium, Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 Home Run Derby with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' Justin Morneau. Four Rangers played in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game: Josh Hamilton, Ian Kinsler, Milton Bradley, and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\nThe Rangers would finish the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79–83), yet ended the season second in the American League West, the club's best finish since 1999. The off-season saw perennial All-Star shortstop Michael Young ask for a trade when the team told him he would be moving to third base to make room for rookie Elvis Andrus. After speaking with club president Nolan Ryan and his agent, Young later rescinded his trade request, and agreed to move to third base. The offseason also saw the departure of mercurial outfielder/designated hitter Milton Bradley to free agency.\nThe 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and Ian Kinsler, the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Rangers finished the season at 87–75, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the American League West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth straight All-Star appearance. Josh Hamilton and Nelson Cruz were also named 2009 American League All-Stars. Several young stars with the club broke out including the debuts of highly rated rookies Elvis Andrus, Derek Holland, and Neftalí Feliz. Second baseman Ian Kinsler hit for the cycle in April, while having a 30–30 season in home runs and stolen bases. Starting pitcher Scott Feldman posted a fantastic season as well in 2009, finishing 3rd in the American League in wins with 17.\nNew ownership.\nWhile the 2009 season was strong on the field, club owner Tom Hicks became the focus of several reports indicating serious financial problems with his holding group, Hicks Sports Group, which also owned the Dallas Stars, the Frisco RoughRiders (the Rangers AA-farm club), of Liverpool F.C. (sold in mid-October 2010 to New England Sports Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox), and the Mesquite Championship Rodeo (later sold by HSG). HSG was reported to have gone into default on a $525 million loan.\nIn April 2009, Hicks announced he would be willing to sell a minority interest in the team. Only one month later, Hicks announced he would be willing to sell majority control of the Rangers. In July 2009, it was reported that Hicks borrowed money from Major League Baseball to meet the team's payroll. After the 2009 season, Hicks began scouting prospective buyers and in December, entered into exclusive negotiating rights for sale of the Rangers with a consortium headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer Chuck Greenberg and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan.\nOn January 22, 2010, Hicks Sports Group officially reached a formal agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan (later called Rangers Baseball Express) for approximately $570 million. Under the provisions of the deal, former owner Hicks stayed on as a limited minority partner, but was not allowed to retain a seat on the board of governors. Co-lead investors Dallas businessmen Ray Davis, and Ft. Worth Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen. Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Rangers Baseball Express in a separate deal.\nThe deal was subject to approval by the other MLB owners (a vote is required) and completed by April 1. However, one of HSG's principal lenders (Monarch Alternative Capital) opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes. On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process. Because of public comments made by Hicks deemed detrimental to the process, MLB also stripped Hicks of any responsibility regarding the sale of the team. On May 13, MLB threatened to seize control of the rest of the team's operations if a deal was not completed by the deadline set by the Commissioner.\nAs the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, on May 24, 2010, the Texas Rangers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million. Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary. Officially, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez topped the list of unsecured creditors with an estimated $24.9 million owed by the Rangers. Additionally, the Rangers also owed Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Millwood $12.9 million, and current Rangers third baseman Michael Young $3.9 million. At a press conference, the Greenberg-Ryan group proposed to buy the team for $575 million. The sale would repay all the team's creditors, including players owed back salary.\nAfter several attempts to resolve the deal fell through, the bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held on August 4. The Greenberg/Ryan bid would be the opening bid, and other offers (subject to MLB approval) would have to be submitted by the prior day in order to be considered. At the auction, only one other MLB-approved group submitted an offer—Radical Baseball LLC, a group formed by Houston businessman Jim Crane (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Houston Astros) and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Chicago Cubs). The auction lasted until the early morning of August 5, with the winning bid submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. The bankruptcy court approved the bid later that morning and the bankruptcy case closed. The sale to the Greenberg/Ryan was approved by all 30 MLB owners at the owners meeting in Minneapolis on Thursday August 12.\nThe new ownership group, which included Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan, was called Rangers Baseball Express, LLC and had Greenberg serving as managing general partner and Ryan as club president. Again, co-lead investors Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen. In March 2011, Greenberg resigned as Chief Executive and Managing General Partner and sold his interest in the club following a \"falling out\" with his partners. Following Greenberg's resignation, Ryan was named chief executive officer in addition to his continuing role as team President. Ryan was subsequently designated the controlling owner of the club by a unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011. Co-chairmen Simpson and Davis stated they would not be involved in day-to-day operations.\n2010–2016: Rise to contention.\nFirst pennant: 2010.\nOffseason moves made by the Rangers sent Kevin Millwood to the Baltimore Orioles and acquired free agents Rich Harden, Colby Lewis, and Vladimir Guerrero. With the new influx of talent and success in 2009, the Rangers entered the season with expecting to compete for the division and achieve the front office's goals of 2007. During the offseason, Texas Rangers' team President Nolan Ryan spoke about the Rangers' chances in the upcoming season by saying,\nAfter stumbling out of the gates with a sub-.500 start in April, the Rangers took the division lead with a franchise-best month of June, going 21–6. The Rangers would never relinquish first place after an 11-game winning streak. On July 9, the club dealt one of its top prospects, Justin Smoak, with two other minor leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for former Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe. The Rangers also made moves to acquire veterans Bengie Molina, Jorge Cantú, Cristian Guzmán, and Jeff Francoeur. In the 2010 All-Star Game, the team was represented by Lee, Guerrero, Ian Kinsler, Josh Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, and Neftalí Feliz. After the All-Star Game, came the debut of the claw and antler hand gestures, which gained much popularity, especially after the release of various apparel and souvenir options for the fans. Foam claws and helmets with deer antlers became quite commonplace in the ballpark as the Rangers played further into the fall. The Rangers won the A.L. West on September 25, advancing to the postseason for the first time since 1999.\n2010 postseason.\nAfter winning the AL West with a 90–72 record, the Rangers entered the playoffs for the first time since 1999, and faced the Tampa Bay Rays for the first round, which ultimately resulted in a 3–2 series victory and marked the first postseason series victory in the 50-year history of the Rangers/Washington Senators franchise. Facing the Rangers in the American League Championship Series were the defending World Champion New York Yankees, the team the Rangers failed against three separate times in the 1990s. In the playoffs, the Rangers record against the Yankees was 1–9. In a 6-game series, the Texas Rangers came out victorious, winning the first Pennant in franchise history in front of an ecstatic home crowd. Josh Hamilton was awarded ALCS MVP after setting a series record for intentional walks. The Texas Rangers faced the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 World Series. The Rangers offense struggled against the Giants' young pitching and eventually lost the Series 4–1, the lone win coming in Arlington on October 30. For the first time, the Rangers ended their season in the month of November.\n2011: Repeat AL champions.\nThe Rangers successfully defended their AL West Division title in 2011, making the club's second straight division title and postseason appearance and fifth division title and postseason appearance overall. The Rangers set records for best record (96–66 with a .592 winning percentage) and home attendance (2,946,949). On October 15, they went back to the World Series, beating the Detroit Tigers 15–5 in Game6 of the ALCS. The series featured Nelson Cruz hitting six home runs, the most home runs by one player in a playoff series in MLB history. In game two, Cruz also became the first player in postseason history to win a game with a walk-off grand slam as the Rangers defeated the Tigers 7–3 in 11 innings. However, they would proceed to lose the World Series in seven games to the Cardinals.\n2012: Staff changes.\nThe Rangers did a lot of retooling in the 2011–2012 off season. Staff ace C. J. Wilson left the team to join the division rival Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels also upgraded their offense with the signing of Albert Pujols, causing more parity within the division. The Rangers responded by signing Yu Darvish of the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Central League in Nippon Professional Baseball of Japan. The team also converted closer Neftalí Feliz to a starting pitcher upon signing Joe Nathan to take over closing duties in the bullpen. The Rangers would not repeat as AL West champions, but would qualify for the postseason as the top wild card team in the AL. They would lose the wild card game to the Orioles.\n2013–14: Missed postseasons.\nIn 2013, the Rangers finished 91–71, which tied them with Tampa Bay for the final wild card position. The Rangers would lose the tie-breaker game to the Rays 5–2. In 2014, the Rangers slumped to their first losing season since 2008. Late in the season, manager Ron Washington resigned, citing personal reasons.\n2015–16: Back-to-back AL West champions.\nIn 2015, under new manager Jeff Banister, the Rangers overcame a slow start to win the AL West. The club was aided by the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Cole Hamels. On the last day of the regular season, Hamels would pitch a complete game in a victory over the Angels that clinched the division for the Rangers. In the Division Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Rangers would win the first two games in Toronto, but then lose three straight to end their season.\nIn 2016, the Rangers repeated as AL West champions with the best record in the AL. They would face the Blue Jays again in the ALDS. This time, the Blue Jays swept the series.\n2017: Missed postseason.\nWith a returning top bullpen and new recruits, the Rangers had hopes of postseason success. However, they ended their 2017 season 78–84, and tied for 3rd in the AL West.\n2018: Staff changes.\nThe Rangers finished their season 67–95, and finished 5th place in the AL West. With little success the previous seasons, Jeff Banister was fired as club manager. Rangers bench coach, Don Wakamatsu, was promoted to interim manager for the final games of the season. After the season concluded, the Rangers decided on Chris Woodward to be the new team manager.\n2019–22: Rebuilding.\nThis season's opener was on March 28, and it acted as the final opening day game at the stadium. The final season at Globe Life Park (not to be confused with the new Globe Life Field) marked the end of an era. The Ranger's new manager, Chris Woodward, explained the direction of the 2019 season:\n The Rangers finished the 2019 season with a 78–84 record, which placed them third in the American League West.\nThe club moved into their new stadium, Globe Life Field, for the 2020 season. During the pandemic-shortened 60-game season, the Rangers posted a league-worst 22–38 record. After the season, Elvis Andrus, the last player who had remained with the team after their 2011 World Series run, was traded to the Oakland Athletics.\nIn 2021, the Rangers once again finished last in the AL West with a 60–102 record. The 2022 season, despite the acquisitions of middle infielders Marcus Semien and Corey Seager, saw minimal improvement for the club, as they finished fourth with a 68–94 record.\n2023-present: The Bruce Bochy Era and First World Series Championship.\nThe Rangers hired three time World Series-winning manager Bruce Bochy—bringing him out of retirement after 4 seasons—and signed star pitchers Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi in the 2022-23 offseason. In 2023, despite injuries to many star players, most notably deGrom, who had Tommy John surgery in June, the team would improve their record from the previous season by 22 games with an 90–72 record, while playing in the postseason for the first time since 2016 with the help of mid-season pitching acquisitions Max Scherzer and Jordan Montgomery and September call-up and top prospect Evan Carter.\nThe Rangers led the AL West for much of the 2023 season. However, the Houston Astros would take the division on the season's final day due to a Rangers loss to Seattle and the Astros owning the tiebreaker via winning the regular season series between the two clubs.\nThe Rangers went on to sweep the Tampa Bay Rays in two games in their wild card series for their first postseason series win since 2011. They would then follow that up with a three-game sweep of the top seeded Baltimore Orioles in the ALDS to advance to the 2023 ALCS.\nIn the ALCS, the Rangers defeated bitter division rival Houston Astros 4 games to 3, in a series where every game was won by the road team. The Rangers thus advanced to the 2023 World Series and defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4 games to 1 to win the franchise's first World Series title."

An outfielder, Taylor played for 17 pro seasons (1962–1978), including a dozen in minor league baseball, four years in Nippon Professional Baseball, and one full season in the Major Leagues with the San Francisco Giants. Taylor batted left-handed, threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nTaylor signed with San Francisco in 1962 and played eight years in their farm system, winning the 1964 California League batting title with a .364 average. Another productive campaign in 1969 — during which he batted .331 for the Triple-A Phoenix Giants — earned him a spot on the 1970 Giants' 40-man spring training roster. Wrote Baseball Digest in its annual rookie scouting report: \"Seldom swings at a bad pitch. Struck out only 25 times in 438 at bats ... Spray hitter with little power but ready to step into a Major League uniform right now. Should make it with Giants.\"\nThe report was prescient: Taylor stayed with the Giants all season, getting into 63 games, with an even 100 plate appearances and 84 official at bats. Of his 16 hits, two were for extra bases, but both were home runs against the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, on May 27 against José Peña, and on July 3 in a pinch hitting role against Don Sutton, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nTaylor returned to Phoenix in 1971 and 1972, and batted over .300 each season, giving him an opportunity to play Japanese baseball from 1973–1975. He then finished his pro career with two more seasons in the Giants' minor league system. All told, he collected 1,258 hits and batted .301 in his minor league career."

        "text": "David Bailey (born March 3, 1981) is an American professional basketball player. He is most notable for his time spent as point guard for the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team from 1999 to 2003. He was a three-time All-Horizon League selection (two-time first team), a Horizon League scoring champion, a Horizon League assists champion and Horizon League All-Tournament team selection. He is the older brother of crosstown Horizon League foe and former George Westinghouse College Prep teammate Martell Bailey. The brothers' tenure in the league overlapped for two seasons, including one in which they were both All-League honorees. They played head-to-head several times, including a Horizon League men's basketball tournament championship game in which both were key performers.\nHigh school.\nAs a , junior point guard, Bailey led Westinghouse to the quarterfinals of the Chicago Public School League championships. He missed a month of his senior season with a broken wrist, but was back in the lineup by mid January. As a senior, the team reached the semifinals. Following the season, David and junior teammate Cedrick Banks were first team All-Chicago Public School League and Martell was second team. As a second team All-state selection, he signed with Loyola. He was also recruited by Rhode Island, Northern Illinois and Southwestern Louisiana. Loyola head coach Larry Farmer was advised to recruit Bailey by his former head coach John Wooden.\nCollege.\nBailey began contributing in his first moments on the court at Loyola in 1999, and he is credited with saving a game as a freshman. Bailey had the ability to slam dunk the basketball. At Loyola, Bailey earned 2000–01 and 2001–02 first team All-Horizon League recognition and 2002–03 second team recognition (along with his brother who was also on the second team that season). He was also a 2001–02 All-Tournament Team selection.\nAlthough the Bailey brothers played each other as Horizon League foes several times, the most notable was the 2002 Horizon League men's basketball tournament where the fifth-seeded Ramblers (17–12) and sixth-seeded Flames (19–13) opposed each other in the championship game for a 2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament invitation with the entire family in attendance. Although David made the All-Tournament team, younger brother Martell's team prevailed by one point in overtime, with Martell making a steal of a pass by David with 13 seconds remaining. David scored 35 points, while Martell only contributed 3 field goals, but all of Martell's field goals came in overtime, including one following the crucial steal. Nonetheless, the \"Chicago Tribune\" described David's gritty efforts on the season as heroic.\nDuring his career, he was named Horizon League Player of the Week three times (January 22, 2001; November 26, 2001 and December 3, 2001). He was also a 2001–02 All-Tournament Team selection.\nHe led the Horizon League in assists in 2000–01 with 170 in 28 games for a 6.1 average and led the league in scoring the subsequent season with 651 points in 30 games for a 21.7 average. Bailey retired as the tenth leading scorer in Horizon League history in 2003 with 1933 points. This ranked him as the third-leading scorer in Loyola Ramblers history, and he retired as the Loyola leader in three point shots made. In his final career home game, he opposed his brother.\nProfessional career.\nBailey began his career in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) with the Idaho Stampede during the 2003–04 season, where he was named the CBA Rookie of the Year.\nHe played in the Ligue Nationale de Basketball (Pro A) for a few years including a year each with Le Mans Sarthe Basket, BCM Gravelines and Hyères-Toulon Var Basket. He has also played in the Korvpalli Meistriliiga (KML) in Estonia for Tartu Ülikool/Rock and in the NBA Development League for the Sioux Falls Skyforce, Fort Wayne Mad Ants and Idaho Stampede.\nPersonal.\nBailey's family included his mother, Linda Riley, his father, David Bailey, two older brothers and younger sister, Dakita."

After the third, when he went 20–7 for the Class A Omaha Cardinals of the Western League, he was selected by the White Sox in that off-season's Rule 5 draft.\nMahoney appeared in three games in relief for Chicago during the early weeks of the 1951 season. He was effective in his first two outings, but in the third, on May 13 at Comiskey Park, he permitted a grand slam home run to Al Rosen of the Cleveland Indians in a lopsided, 11–2 defeat. The White Sox placed him on waivers, and he was claimed by the pitching-poor St. Louis Browns on May 29.\nThe remainder of Mahoney's MLB career was spent with the Browns. He worked in 33 games for them through June 14, 1952, making four starts, and posting a 2–5 won–lost record with no complete games or saves. In perhaps his best overall performance, on June 29, 1951, against his former team, the White Sox, he threw 6 innings in a mop-up role, allowed two runs on four hits, and collected two singles in three at bats at the plate.\nIn his 36 big-league games, Mahoney permitted 99 hits and 50 bases on balls in 90 innings pitched, with 34 strikeouts. His career earned run average was 4.96."

        "text": "Nate James (born August 7, 1977) is an American former basketball player and former head coach at Austin Peay State University. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils.\nCollege career.\nJames, a 6'6\" (1.98 m) swingman out of Saint John's at Prospect Hall, played for coach Mike Krzyzewski at Duke from 1996 to 2001. After appearing sparingly as a freshman, James suffered a medical redshirt in his sophomore season after six games. Returning in the 1998–99 season, James became a key reserve for the Blue Devils' 1999 Final Four team, averaging 5.0 points and 2.6 rebounds in 14.7 minutes per game.\nIn his junior year, James was named co-captain of the 1999–2000 team with Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier. He also moved into the starting lineup and upped his averages to 11.0 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. As a senior, James was again named co-captain and led the Blue Devils to the 2001 NCAA championship. He was named third team All-Atlantic Coast Conference and tallied 12.3 points and 5.2 rebounds per game for the Blue Devils. During his time at Duke, James scored 1,116 points and due to his redshirt year became the first player in ACC history to be a member of five regular-season conference championships.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing the close of his college career, James was not drafted by the National Basketball Association. After stints with the Summer League teams of the Washington Wizards and Sacramento Kings, he embarked on an international career. James' career would take him to the Philippines, France, Japan, Bosnia, the Netherlands, Brazil, Hungary and Poland. James was a part of league championship teams in the Netherlands and Hungary.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2008, James retired from basketball and took a role as assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater. Following the departure of assistant Johnny Dawkins to Stanford, James was elevated to a full assistant role for the 2009–10 season. Duke went on to win the 2010 national championship, making James the first person to win championships at Duke as both a player and as a coach. James would stay on as a full assistant for another season before moving to a special assistant role as former Blue Devil Jeff Capel joined the staff. On March 27, 2013, head coach Mike Krzyzewski announced James would be moving back to the bench, naming him an assistant coach for the 2013–14 season, following the announcement that Associate Head Coach Chris Collins would leave the Blue Devils at end of the season to become the head coach at Northwestern University.\nFollowing the departure of associate head coach Jeff Capel to become the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh at the end of the 2018 season, James was promoted to co-associate head coach along with Jon Scheyer.\nOn April 2, 2021, James was named the 13th head coach in Austin Peay history, replacing Matt Figger."

        "text": "Erik Gustafsson (born 14 March 1992) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Calgary Flames, Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens, Washington Capitals and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Gustafsson was selected by the Edmonton Oilers in the fourth round, 93rd overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nGustafsson began playing hockey in Nynäshamns IF, before moving to Djurgårdens IF's youth organisation. Gustafsson represented team Stockholm in the 2008 TV-pucken, a national junior tournament, scoring four assists. He played the 2008–09 season with Djurgården's under-18 team. In the following season, Gustafsson played for both the under-18 team and the J20-team. For the 2010–11 season, Gustafsson had a permanent place in the J20-team which won their division and ended up third in the playoffs. He extended his contract with Djurgårdens IF in May 2011 through to the 2013–14 season.\nGustafsson was called to make his Elitserien (now the Swedish Hockey League (SHL)) debut in the 2011–12 season opener against HV71 on 15 September 2011, but did not receive any game-time. In his second game, against Brynäs IF on 27 September 2011, he made his on-ice debut, playing six minutes of the game. Gustafsson scored his first Elitserien goal on 26 December 2011 against Fredrik Norrena of Linköpings HC.\nOn 23 June 2012, at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, Gustafsson was selected in the fourth round, 93rd overall by the Edmonton Oilers.\nOn 4 April 2013, with Djurgårdens IF demoted to the second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan, Gustafsson left the team to sign a contract with SHL club Frölunda HC.\nAfter two successful seasons establishing himself with Frölunda, and with his NHL playing rights not retained by Edmonton, on 30 April 2015, Gustafsson signed a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks.\nGustafsson began the 2017–18 season with Chicago's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, but was recalled to the NHL on 9 January 2018. He recorded his first NHL goal and added an assist in a 7–3 loss to the New York Islanders on 20 January. On 6 March, Gustafsson signed a two-year contract extension with Chicago.\nIn the 2019–20 season, Gustafsson entering the final season of his contract was unable to keep his scoring pace from the previous season. Adding 6 goals and 26 points in 59 games and with the Blackhawks out of contention for a playoff berth, Gustafsson was dealt by Chicago at the NHL trade deadline to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a 2020 third-round pick on 24 February 2020.\nUn-signed from the Flames, Gustafsson left as a free agent at the conclusion of his contract and later agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on 12 October 2020. In the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, he appeared in 24 games with the Flyers recording 1 goal and 10 points. Unable to cement a role within the Flyers blueline he was dealt at the trade deadline to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for a seventh-round pick in 2022 on 12 April 2021.\nOn 21 September 2021, Gustafsson was signed to a professional tryout contract (PTO) by the New York Islanders. On 10 October, Gustafsson was released from his PTO and signed a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Chicago Blackhawks, marking his second stint with the team.\nAt the conclusion of his contract with the Blackhawks, Gustafsson left as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Washington Capitals on 13 July 2022. In the season, on 17 December, Gustafsson scored his first three goals of the season for his first career hat-trick in a win over the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs. With his ice-time elevated due to an injury to leading defenceman John Carlson, Gustafsson was rejuvenated with the Capitals, scoring 7 goals and 31 assist for 38 points in 61 regular season games. As a pending free agent and with the Capitals looking out of the playoffs, on 28 February, 2023, three days before the trade deadline, Gustafsson was traded to the Maple Leafs, along with a first-round pick in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for defenceman Rasmus Sandin.\nAs a free agent from the Maple Leafs, Gustafsson continued his career in the NHL by agreeing to a one-year, $825,000 contract with the New York Rangers for the season on 1 July 2023.\nPersonal life.\nGustafsson's younger brother Glenn is also a professional hockey player, currently playing for Örebro HK in the SHL."

        "text": "World Series Cricket (WSC) was a professional cricket competition established by Kerry Packer which ran from 1977 and 1979. Packer set the competition up after failing to gain the rights to show Test cricket on his Channel Nine television channel. It was opposed by the International Cricket Conference (ICC), who ruled that such matches would not be first-class, and any players taking part would be banned from playing in officially sanctioned cricket, although the latter was ruled to be a \"restraint of trade\" and was not enforceable. They also barred the WSC from using the term \"Test matches\", or naming a team \"Australia\". As a result, the matches were dubbed \"Supertests\", while the teams were WSC Australia XI, WSC West Indies XI and WSC World XI. In all, 16 Supertests and 58 international one-day matches were played, before Packer and the Australian Cricket Board came to an agreement in May 1979, and World Series Cricket came to an end.\nThe first Supertest began on 2 December 1977, although the first century (100 or more runs in a single innings) was not scored until the third match, in which Ian Chappell accumulated 141 runs in the first innings. Bruce Laird and Viv Richards went on to score centuries in the same match. A month later, Barry Richards achieved the competition's first double century, scoring 207 runs for the WSC World XI. In the same innings, Gordon Greenidge and Richards also passed a hundred, while Greg Chappell did so in the second innings for WSC Australia XI. In the next match, Greg Chappell surpassed Richards' total, remaining 246 not out, one of his record five WSC centuries.\nOnly two centuries were made in the international one-day matches. Kepler Wessels scored the first, accruing 136 runs; his score is the highest in WSC one-day international matches, and makes him the only player to have scored a century in both a Supertest and an international one-day match in the WSC. The other century was scored by Martin Kent, who scored 109 runs. In all, 25 centuries were scored in Supertests, and 2 in international one-day matches. Seven of the centuries were scored at VFL Park in Melbourne, the most of any venue.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\nReferences"

It competes in the Hawke Cup.\nTaranaki as a representative team played as early as 1877.\nFirst-class matches.\nBetween 1883 and 1898 Taranaki played eight matches that are now considered first-class. They won one match, lost six and drew one.\n1897–98.\nTaranaki's 13 innings totals (63, 55, 70, 39, 35, 29, 91, 135, 246, 124, 172, 108, 109) add up to 1276 runs for 130 wickets, an average of 9.81 runs per wicket.

The two teams competed separately in the Hawke Cup from 1910–11 to 1922–23. Neither won the title.\nCurrent status.\nTaranaki reunited in the mid-1920s, and since 1926–27 they have competed in the Hawke Cup. In their first challenge match Taranaki beat Wanganui, Charles Clark taking 13 wickets. They thus gained the title, which they held until Wanganui defeated them in the next season. Taranaki have held the title several times since, most recently in 2007.\nThe Taranaki Cricket Association is based in New Plymouth. The Association forms part of the Central Districts cricket team, which competes in first-class, List A and Twenty20 domestic cricket competitions. Since the 1920s Taranaki have played most of their home matches at Pukekura Park in New Plymouth, which is also regularly used by Central Districts."

        "title": "Southland cricket team",
        "text": "The Southland cricket team represents the Southland Region of New Zealand. They compete in the Hawke Cup.\nEarly history.\nSouthland first played interprovincial cricket in 1864, and often played against touring teams from Australia, Fiji and England. The Southland Cricket Association was formed in 1892, leading to an increase in representative matches, including the annual match against Otago, which began in 1893–94 and continued until the 1980s. In 1910–11 Southland were the first winners of the Hawke Cup. They retained it in 1911–12 but surrendered it in 1912–13 when they did not take part.\nFirst-class matches.\nSouthland had first-class status from 1914–15 to 1920–21. They played eight first-class matches, winning one, losing five and drawing two.\nIn 1914–15 Southland played two matches against Otago, losing the first and drawing the second. In the first match, at Rugby Park, Invercargill, Otago made 166 (Jack Doig taking 7 for 46) and 85 for 3 declared, and Southland 71 and 62. In the second match, at Carisbrook, Dunedin, Southland made 226 (Arthur Poole scoring 77, which remained Southland's highest score) and 152, Otago 212 and 50 for 3.\nIn 1917–18 at Carisbrook, Otago won by an innings, making 313 and dismissing Southland for 149 and 108. The opening batsman Horace Gleeson scored 55 (Southland's only other score of 50 or more) and 21. In 1918–19 at Rugby Park, Otago made only 94 and 88 (Jack Doig taking 5 for 43 and 5 for 41), yet still comfortably defeated Southland, Henry Holderness and Arthur Alloo dismissing them for 41 and 55. Only six players on either side reached double figures.\nIn 1919–20 Southland lost their first match against Otago at Carisbrook by an innings, scoring only 55 and 42 to Otago's 144 (in which Dan McBeath took 7 for 59). However, they won the return match at Rugby Park. Otago batted first, scoring 180, with Dan McBeath taking 7 for 66. Southland replied with 179. Then Doig (6 for 21) and McBeath (4 for 28) dismissed Otago for 50. Needing 52 to win, Southland lost wickets cheaply but McBeath, who had made 32 in the first innings, this time made 28 not out and took Southland to victory by four wickets.\nIn 1920–21 Southland played Canterbury at Rugby Park. Canterbury made 189 (McBeath 8 for 84) and 37 (McBeath 5 for 8), beating Southland, who made 90 and 56, by 80 runs. Reg Read took 14 wickets for 59 for Canterbury. Three weeks later Southland played their final first-class match, against the touring Australians at Rugby Park. Southland made 122 and dismissed the Australians for 195 (Doig 5 for 102, McBeath 4 for 51) before rain washed out the rest of the match.\nLeading first-class players.\nThe opening bowlers Dan McBeath and Jack Doig were Southland's two outstanding players. In four matches McBeath took 35 wickets at an average of 8.45. In seven matches Doig took 38 wickets at 15.78. Arthur Poole was the leading run-scorer with 223 runs in six matches at an average of 20.27. Doig and Poole were among those in the team who played first-class cricket only for Southland. There were five captains.\nLater history.\nAlong with Hawke's Bay, Southland lost their first-class status after the 1920–21 season, leaving just four first-class teams in New Zealand: Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington. In reorganising domestic first-class cricket, the New Zealand Cricket Council chose only those teams that could afford to travel to take part in an annual round robin tournament for the Plunket Shield. \nFrom 1921, for first-class (and in later years List A and Twenty20) cricket purposes Southland merged with Otago. However, Southland continued to play non-first-class matches on their own. They played against some touring teams and resumed their participation in the Hawke Cup in the 1929–30 season.\nSouthland have won the Hawke Cup six times, most recently in March 2018. Their longest periods of success have been when they held the trophy from March 1973 to February 1977, and from February 1989 to February 1992. They play their home games at Queen's Park, Invercargill. \nThe Southland Cricket Association, which organises cricket in the region at all levels, is based in Invercargill. The six teams that play in the senior competition are Appleby, Invercargill Old Boys, Marist Invercargill, Metropolitan, Southland Boys High School and Waikoikoi.\nLeading Hawke Cup players.\nSeveral Southland players have represented New Zealand internationally as well as having successful careers for Southland in the Hawke Cup and Otago in the Plunket Shield. The Test leg-spinner Jack Alabaster played 14 matches for Southland and took 92 wickets at an average of 13.29. His brother Gren Alabaster played 20 matches and took 102 wickets at an average of 14.78. Robert Anderson played 16 games and scored 1773 runs at an average of 70.29. When, to celebrate the centenary of the Hawke Cup, a team of the century was selected from all the participating teams, Gren Alabaster was named the captain, and the other Southland players chosen were Anderson and Richard Hoskin."

        "text": "Shane Harper (born February 1, 1989) is an American professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with the Adirondack Thunder of the ECHL.\nPlaying career.\nShane Harper grew up playing hockey in the greater Los Angeles area. As a youth, he played in the 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Anaheim Junior Ducks minor ice hockey team.\nPrior to turning professional, Harper played major junior hockey in the Western Hockey League with the Everett Silvertips where he was named to the Western Conference Second All-Star Team for his outstanding play during the 2009–10 WHL season.\nCareer.\nOn March 4, 2010, the Philadelphia Flyers signed Harper to a three-year, entry-level contract.\nOn June 12, 2013, he was traded from the Flyers to the New York Islanders, along with a 2014 4th-round draft pick, for the rights to defenseman Mark Streit.\nHarper was not tendered a new contract with the Islanders and on September 9, 2013, he was signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the Chicago Wolves of the AHL. In the 2014–15 season with the Wolves, Harper placed third in the League with 32 goals, for 50 points in 75 games.\nOn July 1, 2015, Harper secured an NHL contract, signing a one-year, two-way contract as a free agent with the Florida Panthers.\nComing out of training camp in 2016, Harper made the Panthers initial 23-man roster.

        "title": "W. G. Grace's cricket career (1872 to 1873)",
        "text": "Following his father's death in December 1871, W. G. Grace increased his involvement with the United South of England Eleven (USEE) in order to provide more income for his mother, with whom he and his younger brother Fred were still living. Grace continued to play regularly for Gloucestershire and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and, when required, by the Gentlemen. In the late summer of 1872, he toured North America with a team of players who all had amateur status. In the 1873 season, he performed his first season \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets.\nBackground.\nFollowing the death of their father, Grace and his brother Fred still lived with their mother at Downend. Their father had left just enough to maintain the family home but the onus was now on the brothers to increase their earnings from cricket to pay for their medical studies (Fred started his in the autumn of 1872). They achieved this through their involvement as match organisers of the United South of England Eleven (USEE) which played six matches in the 1872 season including games in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Grace's first visit to Scotland.\n1872 was a wet summer and Grace ended his season in early August so that he could join the tour of North America. He made 22 first-class appearances, scoring 1,561 runs at 53.82 including 6 centuries with a highest score of 170 not out and taking 27 catches. He took 62 wickets at 11.87 including 9 instances of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 8–33, and 3 instances of 10 wickets in a match. He topped the batting averages ahead of John Selby, E.M. Grace, Richard Daft, William Yardley and A.N. Hornby. His nearest challengers among runscorers were Richard Humphrey, Jupp and Lockwood. Grace's 62 wickets placed him 5th in that list, once again well behind the leader Southerton who took 169. James Lillywhite and the two Shaws were also ahead of Grace and just behind him were Emmett and Street. The best average was William McIntyre's 5.65.\nGloucestershire played seven inter-county matches and had mixed success. Although they defeated both Surrey and Yorkshire by an innings, they lost another match against Surrey and had three draws including two against Nottinghamshire. Medium pacer Thomas Lang, who played for the county till 1875, made his debut.\nGrace made three overseas tours during his career. The first was to the United States and Canada with R.A. Fitzgerald's team in August and September 1872. The expenses of this tour were paid by the Montreal Club who had written to Fitzgerald the previous winter and invited him to form a team. Grace and his all-amateur colleagues made \"short work of the weak teams\" they faced.\nThe team included two other future England captains in Hornby, who became a rival of Grace in future years; and the Honourable George Harris, the future Lord Harris, who became a very close friend and a most useful ally. The team met in Liverpool on 8 August and sailed on the \"SS Sarmatian\", docking at Quebec on 17 August. Simon Rae recounts that the bond between Grace and Harris was forged by their mutual sea-sickness. Matches were played in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, London, New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. The team sailed back from Quebec on 27 September and arrived at Liverpool on 8 October.\nThe tour was \"a high point of (Grace's) early years\" and he \"retained fond memories of it\" for the rest of his life, calling it \"a prolonged and happy picnic\" in his ghost-written \"Reminiscences\".\nGrace became the first batsman to score a century before lunch in a first-class match when he made 134 for Gentlemen of the South \"versus\" Players of the South at The Oval in 1873. In the same season, he became the first player ever to complete the \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season. He went on to do that eight times in all:\nGrace made 20 first-class appearances in 1873, scoring 2,139 runs at 71.30 including 7 centuries with a highest score of 192 not out and taking 29 catches. He took 106 wickets at 12.92 including 10 instances of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 10–92, and 3 instances of 10 wickets in a match. No other batsman came near his runs or average, the best of the rest being Jupp, Fred Grace, William Oscroft and Isaac Walker. Grace's 106 wickets was 4th best behind Southerton, Alfred Shaw and James Lillywhite with Allen Hill in fifth place. William McIntyre again had the best average with 8.38.\n1873 was the year that some semblance of organisation was brought into county cricket with the introduction of a residence qualification. This was aimed principally at England's outstanding bowler James Southerton who had been playing for both Surrey and Sussex, having been born in one and living in the other. Southerton chose to play for his county of residence, Surrey, from then on but remained the country's top bowler. The counties agreed on residence but not on a means of deciding a championship and so the title remained an unofficial award until 1889. Gloucestershire had a very strong claim to this unofficial title in 1873 but consensus was that they shared it with Nottinghamshire. These two did not play each other and both were unbeaten in six matches, but Nottinghamshire won five and Gloucestershire won four."

He served as head football coach at coach of the Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia from 1981 to 1994 and Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama from 2006 to 2008, compiling career college football record of 70–92–4. Thompson was also the athletic director at Morris Brown from 1982 to 1995 and interim athletic director at Stillman from October 2004 to June 2005 and again from January through July 2007.\nIn November 1981, Thompson was named interim head coach for the final game of the season following the suspension of Lambert Reed for striking a player with an ax handle. Following the firing of Reed, Thompson was named the full-time head coach, and served in that capacity at Morris Brown from 1981 to 1995 and compiled an overall record of 50–89–4. After being fired from Morris Brown in December 1995, Thompson was hired as offensive coordinator at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) by Willie Hunter. At CAU, Thompson served as the offensive coordinator under Hunter through the 1998 season when he was moved to tight ends coach for the 1999 season. He was subsequently moved back to the offensive coordinator season midway through the 1999 season following the resignation of Elmer Mixon as head coach.\nThompson then returned to Morris Brown where he served as offensive coordinator from 2001 to 2002 under head coach Sol Brannan. Morris Brown subsequently fired Thompson in January 2003 in an effort to save money after the college lost its accreditation.\nIn 2004, Theophilus Danzy hired Thompson to serve as offensive coordinator at Stillman. In February 2006 he was named head coach after Danzy was resigned elsewhere in the athletic department. He was fired after the 2008 season and compiled an overall record of 16–16 during his tenure."

        "text": "Naked Woman Climbing a Staircase (originally in French Femme nue montant l'escalier) is a drawing done with pencil and charcoal on card made by Joan Miró in 1937. It is part of the permanent collection of the Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona.\nHistory.\nMiró created \"Naked Woman Climbing a Staircase\" during the Spanish Civil War. He was living in Paris when he started to attend life drawing classes at the school of the Grande Chaumiere. Miró returned to constructing the human figure to represent the drama that was then taking place in Catalonia. This feeling can be made out in the shapes used to draw this tortured nude woman climbing a staircase. Other works of this period include \"Still Life with Old Shoe\" and \"Aidez l'Espagne\".\nDescription.\nAccording to the Joan Miró Foundation, \"Miró's despondency brought about by the moral tragedy of the war can be seen in the violent metamorphosis of the figure, in her heavy limbs and in the effort involved in climbing.\" At the top right is a kind of window or box where light rays can be seen entering the room. The woman is using her right arm to try to grab a ladder – this was a symbol that Miró used in several of his works to represent evasion or escape. The external genitals of the woman are similar to those of the woman in \"Man and Woman in Front of a Pile of Excrement\" as they are exaggerated in size. This work is said to be related to Marcel Duchamp's 1912 painting \"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\", although here the woman is ascending. The distortion and effort of the figure are interpreted as mirroring the Spanish Civil War. Duchamp's painting was not original; it alluded to the earlier photographs by Eadweard Muybridge which were amongst the first to record animal locomotion. Miró first saw this work by Duchamp in 1912, during the Cubist art exhibition held at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona.\nMuybridge's idea of a woman on a staircase caught the imagination of not only Duchamp and Miró but also Miró's contemporary Salvador Dalí who created a homage to Duchamp's painting. His model was also shown ascending the stairs like Miró's subject.\n2011 exhibition.\nThe exhibition \"\" that opened in October 2011 was supported by access to Wikipedia using QRpedia codes that allowed access to visitors in Catalan, English and several other languages."

        "text": "West Coast cricket team was a cricket team nominally representing the West Coast of the North Island of New Zealand, but actually from Wanganui.\nWest Coast appeared twice in recorded cricket. The first match was a first-class match against Wellington in 1879 at the Basin Reserve. Captained by George Anson, the team won its only appearance in first-class cricket by 6 wickets. In the low-scoring match, William Barton scored 75 not out in West Coast's first innings; the next-highest score in the match was 26. The team's second appearance came in a one-day match against Wellington in 1882. The New Zealand captain and cricket historian Dan Reese later wrote: \"For a couple of years ... Wanganui cricket reached first-class standard, chiefly on account of Barton, then the best batsman in New Zealand, being resident there. But neither before nor since have they been first-class.\"\nA West Coast Cricket Association was formed in 1888, based in Wanganui and including Hawera and Feilding. It lapsed in the 1890s, and never fielded a representative team. It should not be confused with the South Island's West Coast Cricket Association, formed around the same time, based in Greymouth, which is still in existence."

        "text": "William J. Walker Jr. (born ) was an American basketball player. He was a native of Queens, New York and played the guard position. Walker played collegiately for the Toledo Rockets from 1948 to 1951. He was known as an excellent dribbler and passer, and was the first officially recorded national season assists leader with his 7.24 per game average during the 1950–51 NCAA men's basketball season. However, Walker's collegiate accomplishments were overshadowed by his involvement in a point shaving scandal during his senior year.\nDuring a game against the Niagara Purple Eagles on December 15, 1950, Walker's Toledo Rockets held a lead of 17 points with three minutes remaining. In the final minutes of the game, the Rockets misdribbled the ball, threw errant passes and only won the game by three points. The game began suspicion among spectators that a fix had occurred and an investigation was subsequently commenced. Walker and teammates Carlo Munzi and Robert McDonald were found to be involved with the point shaving plot after having been instructed to win the Niagara game by less than the predicted seven points following a payment from New York gambler Eli Klukofski, who had been involved in other fixes. The three Toledo players had turned down opportunities to point shave previous games against the Michigan Wolverines, Illinois Fighting Illini and Denver Pioneers as it \"meant too much for them and the school\" to defeat those teams. For the Niagara game, Walker received $1,750 from Klukofski and gave $250 each to Munzi and McDonald. No charges were formally placed against Walker and his teammates as the state of Ohio had no laws dealing with sports bribery.\nPrior to enrolling at Toledo, Walker had served in the United States Navy. Walker graduated from Toledo just six weeks before the accusal; he was 25 years old, was married and had fathered one son at the time. Walker showed remorse for his involvement in the scandal. In a July 29, 1951 issue of \"The Toledo Blade\", he was quoted \"In the end all this scandal will help a lot of kids and a lot of schools. My own boy will never make the same mistake I did.\""

        "text": "The Men's Individual Road Race of the 1987 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on September 6 in Villach, Austria. The route consisted of twenty-three laps totaling to a length of . Irishman Stephen Roche won the race, while Italian Moreno Argentin and Spaniard Juan Fernández finished second and third, respectively. By winning the race, Roche also completed the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year.\nRace route and details.\nThe race route contained 23 laps of , equaling a total of racing in all. Each lap featured two climbs that were and , respectively, with some portions having a ten percent gradient. The race started at 10:30 AM local time. Sportswriters found the course to be suited for sprinters, believing that the race would likely result in a sprint finish. Swiss rider Bernard Gavillet stated that it favored the sprinters and the pure climbers chances \"are almost zero.\" The race featured a 500,000 Swiss francs prize for the first place rider, to split among his fellow countrymen. The Italian Cycling Federation had an additional bonus that they'd award each team member 120,000 Swiss francs if an Italian won the race.\nParticipants and race favorites.\nThe race began with 168 riders from 26 different countries, of which 71 finished. \"L'Impartial\" writer Michel Deruns felt the race was open to 40 or so riders to win the event as he felt it would likely end in a bunch sprint. The starting field featured the previous year's winner Moreno Argentin, who was seen as the race favorite by many journalists and the Austrian bookmakers. Guido Bontempi (Italy), Sean Kelly (Ireland), Teun van Vliet (Dutch), and Eric Vanderaerden (Belgium) as other riders capable of winning the race. Swiss rider Erich Maechler who won Milan–San Remo that season was viewed as Switzerland's best hope to win the race. A writer for \"Amigoe\" believed the Dutch and Italian teams to be the best teams competing in the race. \"La Stampa\" writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano believed an Italian rider would win the race, specifically Argentin or Bontempi, but stated the Dutch riders were a team to \"fear.\" Cees Olsthoorn of \"Het vrĳe volk\" believed that Steven Rooks and van Vliet were the Dutch riders with the best chances of winning.\nGiro d'Italia and Tour de France winner Stephen Roche was viewed as a contender due to his great form throughout the season. There was significant media coverage around Roche because if he won the race, he would win cycling's Triple Crown, where one win's the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in one calendar year. Only five cyclists had won the two Grand Tours in a single season by that point. A writer for \"The Guardian\" stated that if the climbs were higher, Roche's chances would be better. There were concerns over Roche's fitness at the time because he took a break from racing following his Tour success and in his first race back (Italy's Three Valleys), he did not perform well.\nRace summary.\nAfter speculation of the start being delayed due to severe thunderstorms, the race began on time, during heavy rain. The rain on course caused the earlier portion of the race to be slower, what \"De Telegraaf\" described as \"dull.\" Portugal's Orlando Neves attacked off the front of the peloton early and established a lead of nearly two minutes, but was caught by the main field later.\nOn the eighteenth lap, Jan Nevens (Belgium), Argentin (Italy), van Vliet (Dutch), and Juan Fernández (Spain) formed a breakaway. The quartet stretched a lead of one minute over chasing riders. As the riders chased the leaders, Roche (Ireland) and Steve Bauer (Canada) led a group of fifteen to join the leading four during the twenty-first lap. Roche had been principally working to help teammate Sean Kelly get to a final sprint. Shortly after joining the lead bunch, Erik Breukink made a move off the front, only to be caught by Belgian Jozef Lieckens. Van Vliet made another move between three kilometers and one and a half kilometers to go, which Roche, Rolf Sørensen (Denmark), Guido Winterberg and Rolf Gölz (Germany) followed. These attacks by the Dutch riders split the group of thirteen on the road, which left Kelly in the group behind. Sørensen feigned a move with close to remaining, which promoted Roche to react and overtake him as the finish approached. Roche beat Argentin to the line by four bike lengths, as the trailing group bridged the gap.\nAftermath.\nRoche became the first ever Irishman to win the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships. In addition, he became the second rider – after Eddy Merckx in 1974 – to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. Upon finishing the race, Roche stated that was like \"a fairy tale\" and that he \"came to Austria to help [Sean] Kelly\" going on to mention how the course did not suit him and he was not well prepared for the race. Roche commented on his day's performance saying: \"Normally, I never do that kind of move – sprinting from the front for so long – but I realized that If I didn't do something, I'd finish fourth or fifth.\" For his achievements during the 1987 cycling season, Roche was named Freedom of the City of Dublin and became the first athlete to be given this honor. Michel Deruns of \"L'Impartial\" felt that the race was one of the best in the past twenty years in the event, with Roche being the only rider deserving of winning. He stated that Roche did a great job at trying to support Kelly and the two quelled any attacks from the field as the race wound down.\nDutchman Teun van Vliet stated that Germany's Rolf Gölz was on his wheel as Roche launched the final attack. Van Vliet stated \"I was still fresh\", but he elected not to chase hard after Roche as Gölz would benefit from his slipstream and have a great chance to win the race, to which van Vliet commented \"I didn't like that thought.\" Fellow countryman, Adri Van der Poel felt the Dutch team had a strong showing and commented: \"If we can continue to build with this group, there will be more in the future. Then success cannot be inevitable.\" \"De Telegraaf\" felt the Dutch team performed very well, citing three riders finished in the top nine placings. Jean-Paul van Poppel was regarded as the worst Dutch performer as his legs' \"blocked\" during the first lap and did not finish the race. Durens felt the Swiss riders collectively raced an aggressive race, with two riders, Guido Winterberg and Jörg Müller, finishing in the lead bunch. He felt that if the two riders worked together in the final sprint, Winterberg could have finished in the top five or placed on the podium."

        "text": "The Men's Road Race of the 2011 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on 25 September 2011 in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nIn a sprint to the finish line, Great Britain's Mark Cavendish became world champion after making his move down the right-hand side of the course, and just managed to hold off the rest of the field, to become his country's first road race world champion since Tom Simpson won the event in San Sebastián in 1965. The silver medal went to Australia's Matthew Goss – a team-mate of Cavendish on the team – with the bronze medal going to Germany's André Greipel.\nRoute.\nThe race started in the square at Copenhagen City Hall. For the second consecutive time, the World Championship route started and finished in different locations, with the riders completing – including a neutralised section – before reaching the finishing circuit in Rudersdal. Having reached Rudersdal, the riders then completed seventeen laps of the circuit around the suburbs of Søllerød and Nærum, to make up the racing distance of .\nRace report.\nThe field started quickly, with an average speed close to for the first half-hour of racing, as breaks went and were brought back. Finally a breakaway formed, which consisted of seven riders: in the break were Oleg Chuzhda, Maxim Iglinsky, Tanel Kangert, Robert Kišerlovski, Pablo Lastras, Christian Poos and Anthony Roux. As the lead rose up to eight minutes, the Great Britain team began to increase the pace of the peloton to start chasing the group and lower their lead. The lead was brought back to about four minutes, mainly due to the work of Steve Cummings and David Millar.\nAt that point, a first attack came from the main group at the end of the eleventh lap. Johan Vansummeren accelerated and took Yoann Offredo and Luca Paolini with him. Soon after they were joined by Olivier Kaisen and Simon Clarke. These five riders began to eat into the lead break's advantage, with Offredo staying mostly at the back of the line with his teammate Roux up ahead.\nBoth groups ahead merged, creating a group of eleven riders at the front, as Christian Poos had dropped out and fell back into the peloton. The peloton itself, still being led by the British, had split as result of a fall in the thirteenth lap, causing some big names to fall back and never catch up with the main pack, including amongst others the defending champion Thor Hushovd, 2011 time trial world champion Tony Martin and quick finisher Greg Van Avermaet.\nThe pack closed the gap to about one minute, with several riders trying to bridge the gap between the peloton and the leading bunch in small groups. Eventually all riders were brought back, with Anthony Roux surviving the longest, only to be caught by his countryman Thomas Voeckler as he stormed past to form a new leading group in the penultimate lap together with Nicki Sørensen and Klaas Lodewyck. These three never got more than 25 seconds and were held very close by the peloton. Johnny Hoogerland managed to bridge the gap to the leaders, but was caught together with the three a few kilometres later. No riders managed to get away from the bunch after that, allowing Mark Cavendish to finish the work of his teammates in the sprint. Matthew Goss was a close second, while André Greipel needed a photo finish to hold off Fabian Cancellara for bronze. Jürgen Roelandts completed the top five.\nNational qualification.\nAfter a meeting of the UCI Management Committee on 28 January 2011, the qualification system for the 2011 road race remained unchanged from 2010. Results from January to the middle of August would count towards the qualification criteria on both the UCI World Tour and the UCI Continental Circuits across the world, with the rankings being determined upon the release of the numerous tour rankings on 15 August 2011.\nUCI World Tour.\nThe top ten nations in the UCI World Tour rankings by individual nations, may register up to fourteen different riders, of which nine could compete in the event. A nation with less than nine riders in the individual classification of the UCI World Tour rankings would only be allowed to start the race with the number of riders that were classified. If this number is less than six, the country would still allocate six riders for the competition; but could still reach the original allocation via the Continental Circuits. Prior to that re-allocation, any unused allocations within the top ten placings are re-allocated to countries that were ranked eleventh downwards on 15 August 2011, until the places were filled. Other countries could also enter teams into the race through individual riders in the World Tour rankings, if they had at least one rider in the top 100 placings overall, or had one rider listed outside the top 100, but still ranked.\nUCI Continental Circuits.\nIn each of the five continental tours held beneath the UCI World Tour, places could be earned through the rankings by nation. As many as sixteen places were offered through one of these continental tours – through the UCI Europe Tour – to as few as the overall winner of the UCI Oceania Tour. Similar to the UCI World Tour, other countries could also enter teams into the race through individual riders in their continental rankings, if they had at least one rider ranked overall.\nFinal classification.\nOf the race's 210 entrants, 177 completed the full distance of . 32 riders failed to finish the race and Roman Kreuziger pulled out due to a wrist injury prior to the race."

On the morning of the team's departure from Southampton, he responded to well-wishers by saying that his team \"had a duty to perform to maintain the honour of English cricket, and to uphold the high character of English cricketers\". But both his and the team's performance fell well short of this goal. The tour was not a success and the only positive outcome was the fact of the tour having taken place, ten years after the previous one, as it \"gave Australian cricket a much needed fillip\". Most of the problems lay with Grace himself and his \"overbearing personality\" which quickly exhausted all personal goodwill towards him. There was also bad feeling within the team itself because Grace, who normally got on well with professional players, enforced the class divide throughout the tour. In terms of results, the team fared reasonably well following a poor start in which they were beaten by both Victoria and New South Wales. They played 15 matches in all but none are recognised as first-class."

The 1874 season was very successful for him as he completed a second successive \"double\". Gloucestershire again had a strong claim to the Champion County title although some sources have awarded it to Derbyshire and Grace himself said that it should have gone to Yorkshire. Grace made 21 first-class appearances in 1874, scoring 1,664 runs, with a highest score of 179, at an average of 52.00 with 8 centuries and 2 half-centuries.

This was his best season as a bowler. Grace made 26 first-class appearances in 1875, scoring 1,498 runs, with a highest score of 152, at an average of 32.56 with 3 centuries and 5 half-centuries.

Two days after his innings at Canterbury, he made 177 for Gloucestershire v Nottinghamshire; and two days after that 318 not out for Gloucestershire v Yorkshire, these two innings against counties with exceptionally strong bowling attacks including Alfred Shaw, Fred Morley, Tom Emmett and Allen Hill. Thus, in three consecutive innings Grace scored 839 runs and was only out twice.\nHis innings of 344 was the first triple century scored in first-class cricket and broke the record for the highest individual score in all classes of cricket, previously held by William Ward who made 278 in 1820. Ward’s record had stood for 56 years and, within a week, Grace bettered it twice. Gloucestershire were designated “Champion County” for the second time. Grace made 26 first-class appearances in 1876, scoring 2,622 runs, with a highest score of 344, at an average of 62.42 with 7 centuries and 10 half-centuries. In the field, he held 46 catches and 130 wickets with a best analysis of 8–69. His bowling average was 19.05; he had 5 wickets in an innings 11 times and 10 wickets in a match twice.\nIn 1877, Gloucestershire were designated “Champion County” for the third and (to date) final time, largely thanks to another outstanding season by Grace. Grace made 24 first-class appearances in 1877, scoring 1,474 runs, with a highest score of 261, at an average of 39.83 with 2 centuries and 9 half-centuries. In the field, he took 37 catches and 179 wickets with a best analysis of 9–55. His bowling average was 12.81; he had 5 wickets in an innings 17 times and 10 wickets in a match 7 times."

The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time were played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, the tie was played as a single match. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores remained tied.\nThe draw mechanisms for the knockout stage is as follows:\nRound of 16.\nThe first legs were played on 14, 15, 21 and 22 February, and the second legs were played on 6, 7, 13 and 14 March 2012.\nMatches.\n\"1–1 on aggregate.

Listed at and , he batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nBiography.\nFoley attended Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He played on each sport's freshman team, then was on the varsity of each squad for three years, earning a total of nine varsity letters; during his senior year, he was the captain of the football and baseball teams. An outfielder on the baseball team, he was signed by the New York Giants in June 1928, the same month that he graduated.\nFoley played in two games for the Giants during the 1928 season, his only major league appearances. His first appearance was on July 4, in the first game of a home doubleheader against the Brooklyn Robins. In the bottom of the seventh inning, with Brooklyn leading, 7–1, Foley pinch hit for pitcher Tiny Chaplin. With a runner on first base and no outs, Foley struck out facing Brooklyn pitcher Dazzy Vance. Foley did not play defensively, as he was replaced by pitcher Dutch Henry. On July 18, the Giants released Foley in order to add rookie pitcher Carl Hubbell to their roster. When Foley re-joined the Giants is unclear, as he made a second appearance on September 10, in the second game of a road doubleheader versus the Boston Braves. In the top of the seventh inning, with the Giants leading, 7–0, Foley again pinch hit, this time for catcher Shanty Hogan. With runners on second and third with one out, Foley drew a walk against Braves' pitcher Foster Edwards, loading the bases. Foley advanced to second base on a ground out, then scored on a single. He again did not play defensively, as he was replaced by catcher Bob O'Farrell. In January 1929, the Giants sent Foley to the minor league Bridgeport Bears of the Eastern League. However, Foley does not appear in the statistical summary of Bridgeport's 1929 season.\nBy October 1940, Foley was married and working for the board of education in his hometown of Naugatuck, Connecticut. He was inducted to the athletics hall of fame at Catholic University in 1977. Foley died in March 1980 in Vero Beach, Florida, and was interred in Naugatuck. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.\nNotes.\nMinor league experience is absent from Foley's summary at Baseball-Reference.com. While that site has two entries of \"Ray Foley\" minor league statistics, those records include professional games during 1926 and 1927, when Foley was still playing for Catholic University."

On January 13, 2012, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin announced Barlow had been hired to serve as the Commodores' defensive backs coach. In his two seasons at Vanderbilt, Barlow mentored the team’s defensive backs into one of the SEC’s most productive units, finishing in the Top-25 in both passing defense and passing efficiency defense during his tenure. On January 16, 2014, NC State head coach Dave Doeren announced Barlow had been hired to serve as the Wolfpack's cornerbacks coach."

Despite averaging 10.3 points per game for his career, which in the early 1950s was an impressive number, he was known more for his tenacious play and ability to distribute the basketball to his teammates. He is the NCAA's second ever officially recognized season assists leader, and his 7.89 assists per game as a senior topped the nation. O'Toole would also become the last assists champion recognized for 31 years until the NCAA began keeping track again in 1983–84.\nIn his final game as a Boston College Eagle, O'Toole scored 23 points as his team upset highly favored Holy Cross, 64–61. The win capped a 22–5 season, one of the school's best ever, as he exited the court to a standing ovation.\nAfter college, O'Toole forwent any professional basketball aspirations and decided to coach instead, including high school. In 1977 he was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Costa Rica at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "This is a record of Costa Rica's results at the FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nCosta Rica's history at the FIFA World Cup is relatively recent, as they missed the tournament for sixty years since its inception in 1930 until their first appearance at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the team's only participation at the tournament in the 20th century. The 21st century has seen Costa Rica qualifying to all editions of the FIFA World Cup, with the exception of the 2010 edition, which they narrowly missed.\nIn 2014, Costa Rica had its best performance at a FIFA World Cup. On 6 December 2013, Costa Rica was drawn into Group D with Uruguay, Italy, and England, the only group in FIFA World Cup history to feature three former world champions who, at the time, stood within the top 10 of the FIFA Men's World Ranking. Expectations for Costa Rica were overwhelmingly low, and that the team would finish in the thirty-second place. Instead, Costa Rica topped the group undefeated, with two victories and one draw, and only one goal received. After defeating Greece at the round of 16 through the penalty shoot-outs, and losing through the same means at the quarter-finals against the Netherlands, Costa Rica left the World Cup among the eight best teams, undefeated, and conceding only two goals, the least of all participants of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Sports-news outlets such as Goal and \"Mundo Deportivo\" rank Costa Rica's performance in 2014 as one of the biggest surprises in FIFA World Cup history. Such a performance at the World Cup boosted Costa Rica's prestige in the international scene, as fifteen of the twenty-three players of the squad changed teams in the two transfer windows following the World Cup, including goalkeeper Keylor Navas signing for Real Madrid. Both the Costa Rican performance at the 2014 World Cup and Navas' subsequent, successful stint with Real Madrid had a significant impact on Costa Rican sports, economy, tourism, and society.\nCosta Rica ranks third in FIFA World Cup appearances within the CONCACAF region, and first within the UNCAF subregion, in which they hold as many participations as the rest of Central America combined. Costa Rica remains the only Central American team to win a match at a World Cup, which they have done six times, and the only team within that region to qualify past the group stage, which they have done twice.\nThe Borges family, namely father Alexandre Guimarães and son Celso Borges, have accompanied Costa Rica through all the team's appearances at the FIFA World Cup. Guimarães participated as a player in 1990, then as a coach in 2002 and 2006, while Celso played in 2014, 2018, and 2022.\nGoalscorers.\nFifteen Costa Ricans have scored for the national team throughout their six participations at the FIFA World Cup.\nIn addition to those players, Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer scored an own goal for Costa Rica in 2018."

        "text": "Ice Hockey Tasmania Incorporated, currently trading as Ice Hockey Tasmania, is the governing body of ice hockey in Tasmania, Australia. Ice Hockey Tasmania is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nHistory.\nThe First Ice Rink.\nThe first ice hockey rink was built in Moonah, an inner suburb of Hobart, at 7 Main Road, Moonah. The surface was a standard international size of 16000sq ft, measuring 85 ft x 185 ft and contained suitable plant to enable the production of block ice for public consumption and provide cool storage lockers to store fruit and other perishable goods. The formation of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. into a public company occurred on 6 July 1950. The Rink differed from any other rinks built in Australia as it was the only open air rink at the time.\nThe rink was opened on 23 October 1950 by the Premier of Tasmania, Robert Cosgrove after being introduced by the Managing director of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. Mr. R.L. Worsley to the thousands in attendance.\nFormation of the Association.\nThe first ice hockey association in Tasmania formed on the evening of 23 August 1950 in a special meeting convened by the Nation Fitness Council. The chairman of the council, Max Lyall Moore, said the committee would help further the promotion of ice hockey in the state of Tasmania. Two provisional committees were formed rather than a unified committee, at the advice of Ted Moloney from Melbourne, one for ice skating and the other for ice hockey. Within the meeting the directors of Tasmanian Glaciarium Pty Ltd said the Moonah Glaciarium would be ready to use with a few weeks from this meeting. The first committee for Ice Hockey in Tasmania were: F. J. Ellis, R.W. O'Toole, T. Hope, A.W. Kelly and Alfred Chwalczyk.\nFirst Ice Hockey Game in Tasmania.\nThe first ice hockey team formed in Tasmania were the Mustangs. They played the first game of ice hockey in Tasmania in front of 3000 people at the first ice carnival held in the Moonah Glaciarium. The first game of ice hockey held in Tasmania was on 29 December 1950 and was between the Mustangs and a team composed of Hobart ice skaters, calling themselves the Red Devils. The Mustangs defeated the Red Devils by a score of 4 – 3.\n8 August 1951 while the Mustangs played the Comets during a snowstorm, the match was held up while snow was cleared away due to interfering with play.\nLeagues.\nIce Hockey Tasmania operates a single senior league out of the Glenorchy Ice Skating Rink along with a development program.\nVan Diemen's League.\nThe Van Diemen's League represents the highest level of senior competition in Tasmania.\nThe League consists of 5 teams:\nOn 4 April 2016 the Van Diemen's League expanded to 5 teams with the addition of the Mighty Ducks, who began as a group of All Star players from Launceston. The debut game for the Mighty Ducks was scheduled for 5 April 2016 at 6:30 pm against the Cougars.\nOn 6 March 2017 the Van Diemen's League introduced a new team called Ice Breakers, as the Mighty Ducks were not returning. The debut game for the Ice Breakers is scheduled for 4 April 2017 at 7:45 pm against the Barons."

In some years, a second-level competition, the Excellence Division, has been held.\nFormat.\nThe twelve teams in the league are divided into two divisions, North and South. During the regular season, each team plays each of the others in their division twice (once at home and once away), with 3 points being awarded for a win in regulation time, 2 points for a win in overtime or shootouts, 1 point for an overtime/shootout loss, and 0 points for a regulation time loss. The overtime period lasts 5 minutes, and is played 3 vs. 3 sudden-death. The regular season usually takes place from September to March.\nThe top two teams from each division then go on to play in a three-game playoff tournament (facing each other team once) in a pre-selected host city. The team that finishes with the most points in the playoff tournament is crowned league champions. The playoff tournament usually takes place at the end of March."

        "text": "The North Florida Ospreys represent the University of North Florida (UNF) in men's college basketball. The Ospreys compete in the ASUN Conference (A-Sun) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They play home games at UNF Arena on the school's campus in Jacksonville.\nThe program was founded in 1992 in the NAIA. They entered NCAA Division II the following season. The Ospreys transitioned into NCAA Division I from 2005 to 2009. In 2015, the Ospreys made their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since transitioning to Division I. The Ospreys are currently coached by Matthew Driscoll.\nHistory.\nThe North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team played its first games in the 1992–93 season, spending their first year as a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Independent. UNF initially had no basketball court, so the Ospreys' first three home games were played at Florida Community College at Jacksonville until UNF Arena was finished in 1993. Their first coach was Rich Zvosec. In the 1993–94 season UNF transitioned into NCAA Division II, joining the Sunshine State Conference. In 1997–98 the Ospreys switched over to the Peach Belt Conference, also in Division II. After six seasons, Zvosec was succeeded as head coach by former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Sidney Green. In 1999, Matt Kilcullen became the team's third head coach.\nIn 2005, UNF began its transition into NCAA Division I competition, joining the Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun). The four-year transition period, 2005–2009, was difficult for the Ospreys, who compiled a record of 20–96, a substantially worse record than the Ospreys had faced in their previous six seasons under Coach Kilcullen. In 2009, new athletic director, Lee Moon, relieved Kilkullen of his position and replaced him with former Baylor University assistant coach Matthew Driscoll for the Ospreys' first year as full Division I members. The Ospreys improved under Driscoll, who led them to their first conference tournament appearance in the 2009–2010 season. In the 2011 A-Sun tournament the Ospreys upset Jacksonville and East Tennessee State to advance to the championship game, but were defeated 87–46 by Belmont. The game was UNF's first to be nationally televised.\nIn the 2014–15 season, the Ospreys made their first ever appearance in the NCAA Division I tournament by winning the Atlantic Sun tournament for the first time. On December 6, 2014, they defeated the Purdue Boilermakers on the road, marking their first ever victory over a Big Ten Conference opponent. They also won the Atlantic Sun regular season title for the first time and posted the best record in team history with 23 wins and 11 losses. As a No. 16 seed in the NCAA tournament, they were defeated by fellow No. 16 seed Robert Morris in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio. Nevertheless, the Ospreys drew unprecedented media attention both locally and nationally.\nTheir success continued as the 2015–16 Ospreys began the season with a 93–81 upset at Illinois. It was the program's second win over a Big Ten Conference opponent.\nFacilities.\nThe Ospreys' home venue is UNF Arena. Also the home to the UNF women's basketball and volleyball teams, it opened in 1993 and has a capacity of 5,800. The facility is slated to undergo upgrades and additions as part of UNF's Varsity Village program.\nRivalries.\nNorth Florida's most notable rivalry is with crosstown opponents the Jacksonville University Dolphins. The two universities contest the \"River City Rumble\", in which the school with the most wins annually over the other across all sports receives a trophy, the SunTrust Old Wooden Barrel.\nThe first game between North Florida and Jacksonville was played on November 23, 2004 when JU defeated UNF, a Division II program, 78–73. The Ospreys' first win over their crosstown rival came on January 25, 2006 by a score of 90–78. The series record was 8–1 in favor of JU through the 2008–09 season, when UNF completed their transition to Division I.\nAfter beginning their Division I era 0–5 against the Dolphins, UNF finally defeated JU in the 2011 A-Sun Tournament quarterfinals in one of the young program's most significant wins. Since then, the Ospreys have held the edge, bringing the all-time series record to 15–10 in favor of JU after the 2015–16 season. However, UNF leads the series 9–7 since UNF became a full Division I member.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Ospreys earned their first invitation to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2015 as a #16 seed in the South Region. They lost to Robert Morris, giving them a tournament record of 0–1. \nNIT results.\nThe Ospreys earned their first bid to the National Invitation Tournament in 2016. Due to renovations at the O'Connell Center, the Ospreys hosted Florida at the UNF Arena. \nConference tournament results.\nIn seven appearances in the Atlantic Sun men's basketball tournament, the Ospreys have an overall record of 9–8. They won their first Atlantic Sun Tournament championship in 2015. \nConference championships.\nThe Ospreys won the Atlantic Sun regular season championship for the first time in the 2014–15 season and won their second in a row the following season.

He then transferred to VCU to play for the Rams, and in just two years became a highly decorated player in the school's history. During his junior season, Hopkins shot 58.5% from the field and finished with the 25th best shooting percentage in the country. He then broke out during his senior year when he scored 538 points, grabbed 333 rebounds (third highest ever at VCU), compiled 19 double-doubles and guided the Rams to both the conference regular season and tournament championships. In the first round of the 1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which the Rams would lose to Mississippi State by seven, Hopkins was named the CBS Chevrolet Player of the Game. Also as a senior, he became the CAA's first player to record 500+ points, 300+ rebounds, 70+ assists and shoot better than 50% from the field in a single season. He was named the CAA Tournament MVP as well as the CAA Player of the Year. For his career, Hopkins scored 950 career points.\nProfessional career.\nHopkins was invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament following his senior season, the only postseason camp conducted for just the top NCAA seniors. It is a chance to impress National Basketball Association (NBA) scouts to possibly get drafted in that respective year's NBA draft. Hopkins was named the MVP of the tournament yet failed to get drafted a month later. Instead, the Continental Basketball Association's Yakima Sun Kings selected him third overall in their draft. He played for the Sun Kings for one season where he was named the Rookie of the Year and got selected to the all-rookie and all-league teams.\nSince 1998–99 he has played for various teams, all in Spain, and became a naturalized citizen of that country. His career highlights include being named a Liga ACB All-Star in 1999 and 2001, a five-time Player of the Month and a 24-time Player of the Week.\nOn November 6, 2012, Blu:sens Monbús, his last team in Spain, announced it will retire his number 4 at the end of the 2012–13 season.\nPersonal.\nHopkins became a naturalized citizen of Spain during his time playing in that country."

Sixteen matches were played (all won) along with a Test match against United States sides.\nThe tour had a relevance for American rugby because it came at a time when the local code, American football, was widely criticised prompted by worries over violent play, serious injuries and evidence of sharp practice by college coaches. That dispute, originated in 1906, had led some colleges (such as Stanford and California, Berkeley Universities) to switch from football to rugby. The \"All Blacks\" (which had toured in North America for the first time in 1905) had already made their contribution to the spread of the sport in the west coast.\nNew Zealand took the tour seriously, with a squad led by veteran player Alex McDonald that won all their matches in North America with large victories, conceding only 6 points in 16 games. The only test was played against the United States, which included players from Stanford and Berkeley.\nSuch hard defeats were a depressing result for the hosts, with the media emphasizing the skill difference between Californian players and the New Zealand side.\nAs a result, the University of California returned to football in 1915, although Stanford would remain in rugby. Several players competed in the national team in the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games where the US won the gold medal on both occasions. However, the medals were only contested by 2-3 countries, with New Zealand absent.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by the \"All Blacks\" in North America:\n Test matches"

        "text": "Jonathan Lee Singleton (born September 18, 1991) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Milwaukee Brewers.\nSingleton grew up in Long Beach, California, and was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009. He was one of several prospects traded to the Astros in exchange for Hunter Pence in 2011. He signed a $10 million contract with the Astros before making his major league debut in 2014, but he struggled, last playing for the Astros in 2015 before they relegated him to the minor leagues and released him in 2018.\nAfter playing in the Mexican League, Singleton signed a minor league contract with the Brewers, for whom he returned to the major leagues in 2023.\nEarly life.\nSingleton played baseball at Millikan High School in Long Beach, California. He committed to play at California State University, Long Beach a few months before the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft.\nCareer.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies selected Singleton in the eighth round of the 2009 MLB Draft. He had been projected for selection as high as the second round of the draft, but his senior year statistics caused him to fall. Singleton reported to the Gulf Coast League Phillies, where he played 31 minor league games that year. He spent 2010 with the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws, where he hit for a .290 batting average, 14 home runs and 77 runs batted in (RBIs).\nPrior to the 2011 season, Singleton was considered the Phillies' second best prospect by \"Baseball America\".\nHouston Astros.\nOn July 29, 2011, the Phillies traded Singleton, Jarred Cosart, Josh Zeid, and Domingo Santana to the Houston Astros in exchange for Hunter Pence. \"Baseball America\" designated Singleton as Houston's top prospect following the 2011 season. He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.\nSingleton tested positive for marijuana in June 2012. He competed in the Arizona Fall League that offseason, and had a second positive test for marijuana in December. On January 9, 2013, Singleton was suspended for 50 games due to his second failed drug test. Singleton said that he had grown up around friends who used the drug and that he had been using it \"on and off\" since he was 14 years old. He spent a month in a rehabilitation center after the second failed test.\nFollowing the 2013 season, the Astros added Singleton to their 40 man roster. On June 2, 2014, the Astros signed Singleton to a 5-year contract that guaranteed him $10 million, and could have been worth as much as $35 million. The extension was the first to be signed by a drafted player with no major league experience. Singleton was promoted from the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) to make his major league debut on June 3.\nSingleton made his major league debut for the Astros on June 3, 2014 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In his first game, he went 1–3 with a home run, two RBIs, a walk, and two strikeouts. His first home run, a solo home run, was off of Matt Shoemaker. On June 8, Singleton lined his first career grand slam off of Glen Perkins of the Minnesota Twins at Target Field to help the Astros to a 14–5 win. Teammates Dexter Fowler, Chris Carter, and George Springer also homered. (Carter's was also a grand-slam).\nOn August 2, 2014, Singleton hit an inside-the-park home run against the Toronto Blue Jays. It was initially ruled an out by the home plate umpire, but was later reversed following a challenge by Astros manager Bo Porter.\nThe Astros optioned Singleton to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies of the PCL to start the 2015 season. On May 13, 2015, Singleton recorded 10 RBIs, including a grand slam and two-run home run against the Albuquerque Isotopes. His 10-RBI game set a Fresno club record, and was one short of the modern-day PCL record, established by Mike Moustakas in 2010. Including the previous two games, Singleton amassed four home runs—two of which were grand slams—and 18 RBI over three games. Over a five-day span, Singleton collected 22 RBIs, including the 18 in Fresno's four game series in Albuquerque from May 12–15.\nOn November 19, 2016, Singleton was placed on outright waivers by the Astros. He cleared waivers on November 22 and was assigned to Fresno. He played the 2017 season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League, and led all minor leaguers with 500 or more plate appearances with a walk percentage of 21.4%.\nIn January 2018, MLB announced that Singleton had failed a third test for a drug of abuse and would be suspended for 100 games. In a statement to the Associated Press, Singleton admitted that he had a substance abuse problem:\n\"At this point, it's pretty evident to me that I'm a drug addict. I don't openly tell everyone that, but it's pretty apparent to myself. I know that I enjoy smoking weed, I enjoy being high and I can't block that out of my mind that I enjoy that. So I have to work against that.\" On May 21, 2018, Singleton was released by the organization, while serving his suspension, during the final year of his contract.\nDiablos Rojos del México.\nOn April 2, 2020, Singleton signed with the Diablos Rojos del México of the Mexican League. He did not play that year due to the cancellation of the Mexican League because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 4, 2020, he was traded to the Guerreros de Oaxaca of the Mexican League. On May 24, 2021, Singleton was traded back to the Diablos Rojos without appearing in a game for the Guerreros. He appeared in 46 games for México in 2021, batting .321/.503/.693 with 15 home runs, 36 RBIs, and four stolen bases.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 9, 2021, Singleton signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers organization. He spent the 2022 season with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, batting .219/.375/.434 in 456 at-bats, including 24 home runs and 87 RBIs. He led all of minor league baseball that year with 117 walks. \nOn November 15, 2022, the Brewers selected Singleton to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. On January 23, 2023, Singleton was designated for assignment after the signing of Brian Anderson was made official. He was released by the Brewers on January 26. On February 10, Singleton re-signed with the Brewers on a minor league contract. In 49 games for Nashville, Singleton hit .258/.384/.483 with 10 home runs and 29 RBI.\nOn June 3, 2023, the Brewers promoted Singleton to the major leagues following an injury to Darin Ruf. In 11 games for Milwaukee, he went 3–for–29 (.103) with 2 RBI. On June 17, Singleton was designated for assignment by the Brewers. After clearing waivers, Singleton elected for free agency on June 21.\nHouston Astros (second stint).\nOn June 24, 2023, Singleton signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros organization and was subsequently assigned to Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys. Singleton was called up to the majors on August 8, after a .333/.446/.692 performance over 33 games at Sugar Land, including 12 home runs, 28 RBI, 26 walks and 34 strikeouts. Singleton made his 2023 Astros debut the same day versus the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He pinch hit in the ninth inning against closer Félix Bautista, drew a walk, and scored on a go-ahead grand slam by Kyle Tucker that led to a 7–6 Astros win.\nMaking his return to Minute Maid Park for the first time since 2015, Singleton homered twice for his first career multi-home run game in the major leagues while driving in a career-high five runs to lead an 11–3 win over the Los Angeles Angels on August 11, 2023."

Ponferrada had unsuccessfully bid for the 2013 World Championships, which were awarded to Tuscany. Other candidates for the 2014 Championships were Hooglede-Gits in Belgium, Chihuahua in Mexico and the Vendée region in France.\nPreparations.\nThe original plan was to have two different finish sections, one for the road races and one for an uphill time trial. The idea was later discarded because it was not possible from a logistical and financial point of view.\nUnpaid volunteers will perform a variety of tasks before and during the Championships. A target of 1000 volunteers was set with a maximum of 1400. When recruitment started begin April 2014, 200 applications were received within the first day.

        "text": "Vincent Smith (born February 7, 1990) is a former collegiate American football running back and return specialist. He played college football at the University of Michigan from 2009 to 2012. He led Michigan's running backs in rushing yardage during the 2010 season.\nEarly years.\nSmith grew up in Pahokee, Florida and played high school football at Pahokee High School. He totaled 4,677 yards and 58 touchdowns at Pahokee, including more than 2,000 rushing yards and 29 touchdowns as a senior.\nUniversity of Michigan.\n2009 season.\nSmith accepted a football scholarship to attend the University of Michigan. As a freshman in 2009, Smith appeared in eight games for the Wolverines. He gained 166 yards on 17 carries against Delaware State on October 17, 2009. He had 276 rushing yards, 82 receiving yards and three touchdowns in 2009.\n2010 season.\nAs a sophomore in 2010, Smith led the Michigan running backs with 601 rushing yards. (Quarterback Denard Robinson led the team with 1,702 rushing yards.) Smith also had 130 receiving yards and scored 7 touchdowns.\n2011 season.\nAs a junior in 2011, Smith ran for 118 yards against Eastern Michigan on September 17, the second 100-yard rushing game of his collegiate career. After the Eastern Michigan game, head coach Brady Hoke named Smith as the Wolverines starting running back, adding that Smith had \"earned that right.\" Against Minnesota on October 1, 2011, Smith became the first football player in Michigan history to score rushing, passing and receiving touchdowns in the same game. He was the first Division I FBS player to accomplish the feat since 2009. Smith's touchdown pass came on a 17-yard throw to sophomore receiver Drew Dileo. During the 2011 season, Smith had 296 rushing yards, 142 receiving yards, 17 passing yards, and five touchdowns (two rushing, two receiving touchdowns, and one passing).\n2012 season.\nSmith saw reduced playing time during the 2012 season. In the third game of the season, Smith scored two touchdowns on three carries against UMass, averaging 6.7 yards per carry. In his final game at Michigan Stadium, a 42-17 victory over Iowa, Smith scored a touchdown on an 18-yard catch and run. Through the first 11 games of the 2012 season, Smith gained 88 rushing yards and scored three touchdowns. Jadeveon Clowney's tackle of Smith in the 2013 Outback Bowl, which resulted in a fumble and sent Smith's helmet flying five yards downfield, became an Internet sensation as it was one of the most brutal hits of all time. Smith said of the hit: \"I couldn't duck or try anything. My head wasn't even down and that's why my helmet popped off.\""

        "title": "W. G. Grace in the 1871 English cricket season",
        "text": "W. G. Grace played in 32 matches in the 1871 English cricket season, 25 of which are recognised as first-class. His main roles in 1871 were as captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and as both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series.\n1871 was a cold, wet summer but nevertheless one of Grace's best seasons as a batsman, for he scored 2,739 runs including 10 centuries in first-class matches at an average of 78.25, the first time anyone had scored over 2,000 runs in an English season. It was arguably his most successful season and was described by a leading cricket historian as his \"annus mirabilis\".\nBackground.\nHaving begun his top-class career in 1864 at the age of 15, Grace had by the 1871 season established himself as the sport's outstanding player. He was unmarried and still living with his parents and his younger brother, Fred Grace at the family home in Downend, near Bristol. Grace turned 23 in July 1871 and was a medical student at Bristol Medical School, having enrolled there in October 1868. Derek Birley records that it was at this time, \"scorning the puny modern fashion of moustaches\", that Grace grew the enormous black beard that made him so recognisable. In addition, his \"ample girth\" had developed, for he weighed 15 stone (95 kg) in his early twenties. Grace was a non-smoker, but he enjoyed good food and wine.\nGrace in 1871 was principally involved with four teams: the Gentlemen, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the United South of England Eleven (USEE). Gloucestershire was then a new club, generally understood to have been formally constituted in 1870 and had played its first two first-class matches that season. Grace had joined MCC in 1869. The USEE had been founded in 1865 and Grace had played for it occasionally but he formally joined the club in 1870 as its match organiser, for which he received payment, though he played for expenses only.\n1871 was a wet summer and, even when the rain relented, there was a persistent chilly wind. Grace, however, had the skill and resilience to cope with adverse conditions and some of his best batting performances were achieved on wet wickets.\nMay: the season begins.\nGrace began the season on 8 May playing for MCC against a Colts XV at Lord's. He took 7/56 in the Colts' first innings and then scored 44 and 31, but the Colts won by 34 runs.\nIn the opening first-class fixture, Grace played a brilliant innings of 181 for MCC against Surrey at Lord's, enabling MCC to win by an innings and 23 runs. A week later, playing for MCC against Yorkshire, also at Lord's, his second innings of 98 (run out) in a low scoring game effectively decided the match which MCC won by 55 runs. After scoring another century (118) in an all-amateurs match, he played for South v North at Lord's and scored 178, enabling his team to win by an innings and 49 runs.\nJune.\nOn 1 June, Grace scored his fourth century in five matches with 162 for the Gentlemen against Cambridge University, following up with bowling figures of 7/103 in the University's second innings. In his next match, he made his first appearance of the season for Gloucestershire, this time playing against MCC and, though he made relatively modest scores of 49 and 34 not out, he still finished on the winning side, by 5 wickets. Apart from an innings of 88 for MCC against Middlesex, Grace had low scores in the rest of June and no great success as a bowler either.\nGloucestershire defeated Surrey at The Oval by an innings and 60 runs, a significant victory for the new county club against one of the established counties. Surrey batted first and were bowled out for 161, largely due to George Strachan who took 5/45. Grace opened the Gloucestershire first innings with his brother E. M. but both were dismissed cheaply and Gloucestershire had to recover from a position of 7–2 to make 315, half-centuries being scored by Charles Gordon, Fred Grace and Robert Miles. James Street took 7/141 for Surrey. Batting again, Surrey needed 154 to avoid the innings defeat but were bowled out for 94 by E. M. and W. G. Grace who took all ten wickets between them, brother Fred helping the cause by holding three catches.\nFollowing successive matches for MCC at Lord's against Cambridge University and Oxford University, Grace travelled up to Grantham with the United South of England Eleven (USEE), his first engagement with them in 1871. It was a match scheduled for three days with the USEE playing 11 against 22 and winning by five wickets. Grace did not bowl, leaving that to James Lillywhite, James Southerton and Ned Willsher. He scored 13 and 56 not out including the winning hit.\nGrace travelled back to London from Grantham to play at The Oval for Gentlemen of the South against Players of the South. Although it was a relatively high-scoring match, he could only make 4 and 11, his team losing by just 3 runs. Players struggled on the first day and were dismissed for 173, Grace taking 3/50, the innings bolstered by Henry Charlwood's 77. Gentlemen reached 187–6 by the close and finished at 323 on the second day. 150 behind, Players now began a recovery and amassed 278–4 at close of play with Ted Pooley 93 not out after Harry Jupp had been dismissed for 97. Pooley went on to 125 on the final morning and Players were eventually dismissed for 398 (Grace 1/32). Needing 248, Gentlemen were dismissed for 245 having reached 239–7, Southerton taking 6/95.\nJuly.\nThe first two Gentlemen v Players matches of 1871 were held in early July at Lord's, starting Monday, 3 July, and the Oval, starting on Thursday, 6 July. The Lord's fixture was drawn as a result of rain. Gentlemen won the toss and batted first, scoring 208. Grace, who opened with A. N. Hornby, scored 50. Players responded with 180, Grace taking 1/16, and Gentlemen then scored 146 all out, Grace making 37. There was no time left for the second Players innings to begin. At the Oval, there was better weather and the match was completed, Gentlemen winning by 5 wickets. They batted first and totalled 299. Grace made only 16 and the outstanding innings was 97 by Walter Hadow. Players struggled and only the efforts of Robert Carpenter, who was 72 not out, enabled them to reach 182. Following on, Players were better in the second innings and scored 260 to leave Gentlemen needing 144 to win. Grace scored 43 as they easily reached 145–5.\nThen Grace cut loose again with an outstanding innings of 189 not out (carrying his bat) in a Married v Single game at Lord's, his Single team winning by an innings and 73 runs. This innings was played on a \"sticky wicket\" after rain and many people considered it the finest of Grace's career, though Grace himself disagreed. In his \"Reminiscences\", he modestly says he \"played for the Single side and made 189 (not out)\". The match was a benefit for Ned Willsher and the second day was rained off so Grace helped to arrange another match for Willsher, played at Mote Park, Maidstone in September. Grace began the innings cautiously and took fifteen minutes to score his first run but then, records Rae, he \"scored at a cracking pace\". MCC Secretary Harry Perkins had no doubts and insisted that it was Grace's greatest-ever performance with rain frequently stopping play and making the wicket at times \"unplayable\".\nWhen MCC played Kent at Lord's, Grace scored 51 out of 183 as MCC won easily by an innings and 9 runs within two days. He scored 146 21 for MCC against Surrey at the Oval, but his team lost by just one wicket despite having had to follow on. Grace took 4/48 in the Surrey second innings as they struggled to reach their target of 111. MCC then played Sussex at Lord's, winning a low-scoring game by 8 wickets in only two days. Grace batted once and scored 59, the only half-century in the match.\nGrace produced his season highlight in another South v North match, played at the Oval, when he made his highest career score to date of 268, having been dismissed by Jem Shaw for nought in the first innings. It was to no avail as the match was drawn. The occasion produced a memorable and oft-quoted comment by Jem Shaw who ruefully said: \"I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes\". The match was a benefit for H. H. Stephenson.\nDuring July, Grace made two appearances for the USEE at Uppingham and Broughton, both being \"odds\" matches with 11 against 22. At Uppingham, Grace scored only one run but took 25 wickets. The match was drawn. At Broughton, the match was ruined by rain and Grace made 18 in his sole innings.\nAugust.\nBeginning on 3 August, Grace captained Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at the Clifton College Close Ground in Bristol. He scored 78 and 55 against an attack consisting mostly of Alfred Shaw and Jem Shaw. The match was drawn. Next came a North v South match at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury which the South won by 100 runs, Grace scoring 31 and 40 including the 2,000th run of his first-class season so far.\nAfter another century for the MCC Gentlemen against Kent, he played for Gentlemen v Players at the Royal Brunswick Ground, Brighton, in August and, for the second time, followed a first innings \"duck\" with a double century. As on the previous occasion, the feat was achieved in a benefit match, this time for John Lillywhite. In the second innings, Grace and his brother Fred shared a second wicket partnership of 241 till Fred was out for 98, W.G. going on to score 217.\nBeginning on 17 August, Grace captained Gloucestershire against Surrey at Clifton College Close and was for once overshadowed by a teammate as he scored only 23 while Thomas Matthews compiled 201. Gloucestershire totalled exactly 400 and won the match by an innings and 9 runs. Grace took four wickets in Surrey's first innings.\nWhen Gloucestershire went to Trent Bridge to play Nottinghamshire, Grace scored 79 and 116 but his team lost by 10 wickets after Jem Shaw took 13 wickets in the match. It was the first time that anyone had scored a century on the ground and Grace's presence ensured a bumper crowd with over £400 being taken at the gate. This money went a long way towards the £1500 that Nottinghamshire needed to erect the Trent Bridge Pavilion.\nSeptember.\nGrace played 4 matches in September including three for the USEE in Birmingham, Chichester and Chesterfield. His final first-class match of the season was at Mote Park, Maidstone where his own select team played Kent in a benefit match for Ned Willsher. The match was drawn; Grace scored 81 not out and 42 not out and took ten wickets in the match with 6–67 and 4–83.\nGloucestershire.\nGloucestershire played four county matches in 1871. They twice defeated Surrey by an innings margin but had less success against Nottinghamshire, drawing with them at Clifton College Close Ground and then losing by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. The team had certain regulars but tended to include occasional and even guest players, some of whom weakened the side, whereas Nottinghamshire generally turned out a full-strength eleven. The key Gloucestershire players were the three Graces, batsman Thomas Matthews, wicket-keeper James Bush (who was also an England rugby union international), slow left-armer Robert Miles and all-rounders George Strachan and Frank Townsend. Newcomers in 1871 were Frederic Carter and George Wyatt who both made a number of appearances over the next few seasons.\nSeason summary.\nIn all first-class matches in 1871, a total of 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge. He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068. Grace's highest score was 268 for South v. North at The Oval. He took 79 wickets at 17.02 with a best analysis of 7–67. He claimed five wickets in an innings 5 times and twice had 10 in a match. Besides Grace and apart from Jupp and Ted Pooley who were the highest runscorers, other leading batsmen in 1871 were Richard Daft, Robert Carpenter, Fred Grace, Henry Charlwood and Ephraim Lockwood. The leading bowlers were James Southerton, Alfred Shaw, Jem Shaw, Frank Farrands, Grace, Ned Willsher, James Street and Tom Emmett.\nAftermath.\nAccording to Harry Altham, 1871 was Grace's \"annus mirabilis\", except that he produced another outstanding year in 1895. Grace summarised it as \"one of my best seasons\" as he scored 10 centuries. He later told Bernard Darwin that he had needed to apply great patience when batting in 1871 because of the generally wet weather which produced poor wickets and difficult batting conditions. Simon Rae remarked that cricket enthusiasts still argue about Grace's \"greatest season\" and that 1871 features in any such discussion.\nGrace had numerous nicknames during his career including \"The Doctor\", after he achieved his medical qualification; \"The Old Man\", as he reached the veteran stage; and most auspiciously \"The Champion\". He was first acclaimed as \"the Champion Cricketer\" by John Lillywhite's \"Cricketer's Companion\" (\"aka\" \"Green Lilly\") in recognition of his exploits in 1871.\nBut Grace's great year was marred by the death of his father in December. Grace and his younger brother Fred still lived with their mother at the family home in Downend and they had to increase their involvement with the USEE to pay for their medical studies."

        "title": "History of boxing in the Philippines",
        "text": "The history of boxing in the Philippines is the history of boxing and the evolution and progress of the sport in the Philippines. In the Philippines, boxing is one of its most popular sports, together with basketball, due to the many accolades it has brought to the country, having produced 45 major world champions (including those of Filipino heritage), one of the most in the world. Despite not having won a gold medal in boxing, the Philippines has had multiple Olympic standouts, with 8 out of its 12 total Olympic medals coming from boxing, along with some of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport. Filipino greats like Pancho Villa and Flash Elorde are members of the two highly respected boxing hall of fames – International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF) and World Boxing Hall of Fame (WBHF) thus, giving the Philippines the most number of boxing hall of fame members out of Asia.\nGolden ages of Philippine boxing.\nBefore the Spaniards and Americans came to the Philippines, Filipinos had their own kind of boxing known as \"suntukan\",\"bare-hand fighting\" in Tagalog, generally believed to have evolved from a Filipino knife fighting technique called \"kali\". During the Spanish colonization martial arts and fight sports were banned, so it was driven underground where the lack of knives and rattan sticks lead to fist fighting.\nFirst golden age of Philippine boxing.\nThe evolution of Philippine boxing began after when Spain ceded its colonial territories, namely Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States as agreed in the Treaty of Paris on 1898 which led to the Philippine–American War on 1899. Some reports state U.S. soldiers brought modern boxing to the Philippines, evidenced by a pair boxing gloves made by Sol Levinson of San Francisco. Another story tells of a renegade soldier brought some boxing gloves to Filipino prisoners and taught them how to use them. However, it was generally believed that three Americans were responsible for the evolution of boxing in the country namely: Frank Churchill and the Tait brothers (Eddie and Stewart) Eddie and Stewart Tait, also dubbed as \"Barnums of Borneo\", were amusement park entrepreneurs who established carnivals and horse racing tracks in Manila, who arrived in the country in 1902. Eddie, believed to be a boxing enthusiast, wanted to attract crowds by teaching Filipino locals some western boxing lessons for free to create American-style Filipino boxers.\nIn 1921, boxing was legalized in the Philippines and began to flourish. Frank Churchill joined by the Tait brothers, established the Olympic Boxing Club in Manila. During this time, the country saw the first batch of great Filipino fighters such as Dencio Cabanela, Speedy Dado, the Flores brothers (Francisco, Elino, Macario and Ireneo), Pete Sarmiento, Sylvino Jamito, Macario Villon and the legendary Pancho Villa. The first golden age of Philippine boxing emerge as Pancho Villa won the universal world flyweight championship from Welshman Jimmy Wilde to become the first ever Asian and Filipino world champion. Villa defended his title three times including a fight in the Philippines with fellow Filipino Clever Sencio where he won by fifteen-round decision, which at the time, nobody thought it would be the last victory of his young career. The glorious era was short-lived following the ring deaths of popular fighters Dencio Cabanela and Clever Sencio along with the death of Pancho Villa from Ludwig's angina and their influential promoter Frank Churchill.\nThere was also the Filipino-Spanish boxer, Luis Logan, who at one time or another held the title Oriental welterweight and heavyweight champion. Logan's boxing career spanned 1925–1940; and spent half his boxing career in Spain, Argentina, outside of the Philippines.\nOn October 2, 1939, a sudden uplift came when Ceferino Garcia won the NYSAC world middleweight championship from American Fred Apostoli at the Madison Square Garden, New York, United States. On December 23, 1939, Garcia successfully defended his title for the first time against American Glen Lee in front of his countrymen inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex which was the first world title bout ever recorded in the Philippine islands. Garcia also competed with some of the best boxers ever like Barney Ross and Henry Armstrong, to whom he denied his fourth title in four weight divisions through a draw. However, he then lost at the hands of Ken Overlin, unable to land his famous bolo punch and losing the title.\nSecond golden age of Philippine boxing.\nOn July 20, 1955, Filipino boxing fans saw the birth of Philippine boxing's second golden era as a Cebuano boxer named Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde beat the then reigning world featherweight champion and later Hall of Famer Sandy Saddler in a non-title bout at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Elorde went on to win the world super featherweight championship from Harold Gomes by a seventh-round knockout on March 16, 1960. Elorde kept his world title inside a division record of 7 years and 2 months with 10 successful defenses, including a one-round knockout of Gomes in a rematch. Flash Elorde, during his time, was one of the busiest fighters who traveled to fight very often. A great and fearless fighter, Elorde was one of the most beloved Filipino athletes since Pancho Villa. In this Elorde inspired period, twenty world champions were created spanning from Roberto Cruz to Gerry Peñalosa along with the formation of the \"Big Four of Professional Boxing\" or the major sanctioning bodies, namely the WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO. However, as time goes by, boxing was becoming less popular in the country because of many alternative sports including basketball until Manny Pacquiao came.\nThird golden age of Philippine boxing (present).\nA Filipino boxer named Manny Pacquiao was an entertaining star in the local boxing television show called \"Blow-by-Blow\" by the famed Filipino manager and promoter Rod Nazario. Viewers became accustomed to Pacquiao's name not only because of his aggressive style but also due to his unique looks and catchy surname. Pacquiao's ascendancy heralded a new wave of Filipino boxers and marks the third great era of Philippine boxing.\nOn December 4, 1998, Pacquiao upset Thai Champion Chatchai Sasakul in Thailand to win the Lineal and WBC flyweight championship (his first world title). On his title defense, Pacquiao lost his title on the scale and was knocked out in the fight by Medgoen Singsurat of Thailand. Pacquiao lost his WBC title on the scales as he was unable to make the flyweight limit. Pacquiao gained weight and skipped the super flyweight and bantamweight divisions to fight at super bantamweight division. Pacquiao, for the second time in his career, was the heavy underdog against South African Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, the reigning IBF super bantamweight champion. On June 23, 2001, Pacquiao dethroned Ledwaba to win his second world title in two different weight divisions. In 2003, Pacquiao's career rose to its peak as he stopped the then reigning Lineal and \"The Ring\" featherweight champion Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico via 11th-round technical knockout. Since that time, Pacquiao has acquired three lineal titles and four major (WBC &amp; IBF) world titles along six different divisions—flyweight (112 lbs.), super bantamweight (122 lbs.), featherweight (126 lbs.), super featherweight (130 lbs.), lightweight (135 lbs.) and light welterweight (140 lbs.).\nOn November 14, 2009, Pacquiao surpassed Oscar De La Hoya's record of six-division titles by stopping WBO welterweight champion Miguel Angel Cotto to win his seventh title across seven divisions. One year later, he made history by being the first boxer ever to win eight world titles in eight weight divisions as he dominated Mexican slugger Antonio Margarito to win the vacant WBC light middleweight title in a catchweight bout. Since 2003, Pacquiao amassed a record of 21 wins, 3 defeats and 1 draw in his last 25 fights. The Filipino fighter defeated some of the best opposition available on the way to superstardom (earning the nickname \"the Mexicutioner\") including Mexicans Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales, Juan Manuel Márquez and Antonio Margarito, British Ricky Hatton, Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto, and Americans Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, Timothy Bradley and Keith Thurman.\nThe \"Pacquiao Wave\" regenerated boxing in the Philippines, inspiring a new generation of boxers to aim ever higher. Nonito Donaire, one of the Pacquiao-wave fighters, became the second Asian to win four world titles in four weight divisions by defeating South African Simpiwe Vetyeka to claim the WBA featherweight title on May 31, 2014. In 2017, Donnie Nietes became the third Filipino boxer to win world titles in three different weight divisions when he defeated Thailand's Komgrich Nantapech in May 2017. In Dec. 31 2018, Donnie Nietes became the third Filipino boxer and third Asian to win world titles in Four different weight divisions when he defeated Japanese Kazuto Ioka via split decision on New Year's Eve, winning the vacant World Boxing Organization belt at the Wynn Palace in Macau. Another famous or rather infamous Filipino boxer John Riel Casimero became the fourth Filipino boxer to win world titles in three different weight divisions when he defeated Zolani Tete via TKO on November 30, 2019 in England. His boxing persona pave the way to building-up his fights, this makes him a rarity in amongst Filipino boxing fans in present times.\nPhilippines' contribution to boxing.\nThe Philippines is one of the founding member nations of the World Boxing Council (WBC) and Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation (OPBF). Filipino boxers also contributed to the history of boxing from rules and techniques to records and achievements. Pancho Villa is not only the first Asian and Filipino world champion but is also described as one of the cleanest boxers before the proper rules were established. Ceferino Garcia is credited as the inventor of the \"bolo punch\". However, according to \"Tahoma News-Tribune\", a fellow Filipino boxer named Macario Flores was reportedly using it. Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde still holds the record for longest reign in the super featherweight or junior lightweight (130 lbs.) division – 7 years, 2 months and 29 days with 10 title defenses. His success was due to his innovative footwork and maneuvers which he learned from training Balintawak Eskrima with his father \"Tatang\" Elorde who was the Eskrima champion of Cebu. Elorde's style from eskrima has been adopted by many boxers, including his friend Muhammad Ali, which influenced the out-boxer style of boxing.\nWhile Donnie Nietes holds as the longest Filipino world champion in the light flyweight division. On November 13, 2010, Manny Pacquiao entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the first ever boxer to win eight world titles in eight (8) different divisions (see also Octuple Champion) by defeating Mexican Antonio Margarito via 12-round unanimous decision to claim the vacant WBC light middleweight championship.\nPhilippines' popular ring officials.\nThe Philippines has produced respected ring officials. Referee Carlos \"Sonny\" Padilla officiated the famous \"Thrilla in Manila\" match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1975. He worked as third man in the ring in many big matches for over 25 years.\nIn 2012, the World Boxing Council awarded Rey Danseco the Judge of the Year. He received the accolade in a rite held during the 50th Annual WBC Convention at the Grand Oasis Hotel in Cancún, Mexico. To date, Danseco is the only Asian boxing ring official to win an award of such magnitude. He is also a multiple Judge of the Year awardee in the Philippines until he moved to the US in 2012.\nDanseco judged the world championship fights of some big names in boxing of his generation, such as Canelo Alvarez, Errol Spence Jr., Danny García, Robert Guerrero, Julio César Chávez, Bernard Hopkins, Austin Trout, Gerry Penalosa, Pongsaklek Wonjongkam, Badou Jack, Jorge Arce, Jhonny González, Adonis Stevenson, Tony Bellew, Josh Taylor, Toshiaki Nishioka, Shawn Porter, Edgar Sosa, Miguel Berchelt, Leo Santa Cruz, Abner Mares, Amir Khan, Daniel Dubois, Jamel Herring, Jessica McCaskill, Regis Prograis, and Khalid Yafai.\nPadilla refereed or judged the fights of notable world champions, including Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Alexis Argüello, Erbito Salavarria, Leon Spinks, Ken Norton, Larry Holmes, Sugar Ray Leonard, Lupe Pintor, Roberto Durán, Marvin Hagler, Roberto Durán, Bobby Chacon, Pipino Cuevas, Julio César Chávez, Michael Spinks, Mike Tyson, Michael Moorer, George Foreman, Azumah Nelson, Riddick Bowe, Terry Norris, Ray Mercer, Iran Barkley, Humberto González, Roger Mayweather, Kennedy McKinney, Johnny Tapia, Marco Antonio Barrera, Antonio Tarver, and Filipino greats Manny Pacquiao, Dodie Boy Peñalosa, Erbito Salavarria, Ben Villaflor, and Rolando Navarette in his career from 1967 until his retirement in year 2000.\nList of men's professional boxing world champions.\nThe following is a list of Filipino boxing champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring.\nIn December 2000, the WBA created an unprecedented situation of having a split championship in the same weight class by introducing a new title called \"Super world\", commonly referred to simply as \"Super\". The \"Super\" champion is highly regarded as the WBA's primary champion, while the \"World\" champion – commonly known as the \"Regular\" champion by boxing publications – is only considered the primary champion by the other three major sanctioning bodies (WBC, IBF, and WBO) if the \"Super\" title is vacant.\nA \"Unified\" champion is a boxer that holds the \"Regular\" title and a world title from another major sanctioning body (WBC, IBF, WBO) simultaneously. An \"Undisputed\" champion as defined by the WBA, only needs to hold three of the four major titles but in some cases they may change a \"Super\" champion into an \"Undisputed\" champion after a failed title defense (e.g. Anselmo Moreno losing to Juan Payano and Chris John losing to Simpiwe Vetyeka). This is not to be confused by professional boxing's own definition of an undisputed champion, in which a boxer must hold all four major titles.\nOther former international/national-world boxing commissions and organizations from the beginning of boxing are also included here:\nNote\nList of women's professional boxing world champions.\nThe following is a list of filipina boxing champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring."

        "text": "Liu Song () is a male table tennis player from Argentina. From 1998 to 2011 he won several medals in singles, doubles, and team events in the Latin American Table Tennis Championships.\nBiography.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in Guangxi, China he started practising table tennis at the age of nine. He studied in a special school for athletes and reached eighth place in China's national ranking. Between 1990 and 1994 he was a part of China's national team, and he won the national junior single's championship in 1991. In 1986 he started studying marketing in the University of Tokyo, although he dropped it after a year after deciding to go to Argentina. That's why it is said that Liu has three nationalities (Chinese, Argentinian and Japanese). In 1990 his family moved to Argentina, living in Floresta, a neighborhood in Buenos Aires city, where they opened a laundry. Five years later, Song followed his family. He adopted Argentinian nationality, the country that he always represented at international level, and he started training in the Centro Nacional de Alto Rendimiento Deportivo.\nInternational career.\nHis first big accomplishment was in 1995 in Brazil's Open; in 1996 he reached the semi-finals of the US Open, in the United States.

        "text": "Jacques Brunel (born 14 January 1954) is a French rugby union coach and former player. He was most recently the French national team head coach, having previously been assistant coach for his nation and had led the Italian national team between 2011 and 2016. Brunel, who has spent most of his career in France, formally coached his former team Auch, as well as Bordeaux Bègles, Colomiers, Pau and Perpignan.\nEarly life and playing career.\nJacques Brunel, born in Courrensan, played club rugby for his local side at age grade level, and joined the academy side at Auch in 1967 at the age of 13. Haven moved through the age grade ranks, he graduated to the club's senior side in 1972 at the age of 18. He represented the club up until 1979, playing in the French Rugby Union Championship, where for most of the time, the club failed to progress past the Pool stages. During the 1979–80 French Rugby Union Championship, Brunel played for Grenoble, where they made it to the Last 32 stage, but was beaten by Montferrand 10–3. In 1980, again Brunel only made it as far as the Last 32, with Carcassonne, being beaten by Béziers 29–6. In 1981, he returned to Auch, where he remained with the club until his retirement at the end of 1987–88 season.\nCoaching career.\nThe beginning.\nHe started coaching immediately after he retired from playing rugby in 1988, where he became the head coach of Auch until 1995. During his time as coach at the club, he led the team to 4 Top 16 rounds, 3 of which came in consecutive years. In 1995, he arrived at Colomiers, where in just his second season in charge, he led the team to the Quarter-finals of the 1996–97 French Rugby Union Championship. During the 1997–98 season, he led the team to the Semi-final of the French Rugby Union Championship, but narrowly lost to Perpignan 15–12. However, he did oversee Colomiers first ever silverware, when they won the 1997–98 European Challenge Cup. In 1999, Brunel took the team one step forwards, leading them to the 1999 Heineken Cup Final, only to lose to Ulster 21–6.\nIn 1999, he moved to Pau, where during the 1999–2000 French Rugby Union Championship, they made it to the semi-final, where they lost to Brunel former club Colomiers 24–22. Pau did however, make it to the 1999–2000 European Challenge Cup final, where they beat Castres Olympique 34–21. However, in Brunel stood down from his post after his second season, following Pau's poor form, and close call with relegation. In 2001, Jacques Brunel joined the technical staff of the French national team under the guidance of Bernard Laporte, training the forwards. Under his guidance, France became known for their strong forwards work, which was a key element in their Six Nations Championship grand slam winning campaigns in 2002 and 2004. It was also a key part in France coming fourth in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and saw them through to the Semi-finals of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which saw France beat New Zealand, 20–18, in the Quarter-finals. However, France were dominated by a strong England pack during the Semi-finals, which saw the home side lose 14–9, before being dominated again by Argentina in the Bronze final, to lose 34–10. France's form during that world cup, saw all coached lose their job with the National team.\nPerpignan (2007–2011).\nAfter the world cup, he joined Perpignan as the head coach. In his debut season, he guided the team to fourth on the table, however they lost to Clermont 21–7 in the Semi-final. Though, during the 2008–09 Top 14 season, he led the team to victory, topping the table with 92 points, 20 wins from 26 matches, and a Semi-final win over Stade Français 25–21. They then beat Clermont 22–13. Perpignan topped the table again in the 2009–10 Top 14 season, and then went on to beat Toulouse 21–13 in the Semi-final to set up a repeat of the 2009 final. However, on this occasion, Clermont won 19–6. In 2011 he left his post with Perpignan to join the Italian national team as head coach.\nItaly (2011–2016).\nJacques Brunel's first match in charge of Italy came during the 2012 Six Nations Championship, which saw Italy face France in Paris. France scored 4 tries to claim a 30–12 victory in Brunel's opening match. That was followed by a narrow 15–19 loss to England in Rome and a 42–10 loss to Ireland. They went into the final week with 4 losses, however a 13–6 win over Scotland saw Italy avoid the wooden spoon. Brunel's starting pack during that Scottish game, was the most internationally experienced ever to play an international match. Brunel gained a further two victories during Italy's 2012 Summer Tour, where they beat Canada 25–16 and the United States 30–10. They did however lose to Argentina in the opening fixture of the tour, losing 37–22. During Italy's 2012 end of year tests, they came within three points of beating Australia, losing 19–22 in Florence.\nDuring the 2013 Six Nations Championship, Italy equaled their best positioning of fourth, with wins over France and Ireland, with the Irish win the first against the team in the Championship. Due to the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, Italy joined Scotland, Samoa and South Africa in a quadrangular tournament hosted by the Springboks. Italy lost all three games, to finish last in the tournament. During the 2013 end of year tests, Italy claimed a sole win against Fiji, who was down to just 11 player at one point in the game, where Italy scored 17 points in that time, to earn a full-time score of 37–31.\nItaly finished last during the 2014 Six Nations Championship, the first time since Brunel became head coach. They lost all five matches, which was followed by a Summer Tour white-wash in June later that year. They lost in consecutive week-ends to Fiji 25–14, Samoa 15–0 and Japan 26–23 - which was Italy's first ever loss to the Japanese. Their 9-match losing streak came to an end in their opening fixture of the 2014 end of year tests, beating Samoa 24–13.\nIn 2015, Italy finished fifth during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, with their only win coming against Scotland, winning 22–19. Though, this win was Italy's first win over Scotland in Scotland, since 2007. Italy later went down to Scotland twice during the Rugby World Cup Warm-ups, with the second test being a record defeat, 48–7. During their 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign, Italy only came away with 2 wins to finish third in their pool. They opened with a 32–10 loss to France, before narrowly beating Canada 23–18 a week later. They were massively competitive in their game against Ireland, losing by just 7 points, 16–9. Their final game came against Romania, which was a must win game for both teams if they wanted to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Italy scored 4 tries to earn a bonus point, which led them to a 32–22 win.\nBordeaux Bègles.\nOn 14 March 2016, following the completion of his contract with Italy, Brunel announced he would become the forwards coach for Bordeaux Bègles. However, by the end of the 2015–16 Top 14 season, Brunel had been promoted to head coach of Bordeaux, with Régis Sonnes stepping down as the lead coach.\nBrunel's first match in charge was a 15–9 victory over reigning champions Racing 92. Despite the good start to the season, Bordeaux only went on to win 10 games in 25 matches for the rest of the season, placing them in eleventh on the table. While in Europe, they failed to progress out of the pool stage, winning just half of their games.\nUntil his departure, Bordeaux put in inconsistent performances in the 2017–18 Top 14 season, winning just 7 games in the opening 13 rounds. Though this did include victories over giants Clermont, Montpellier and Toulon. Whilst in the European Challenge Cup, they had only managed to defeat Russian side Enisey-STM heading into the final two rounds. With the announcement of Brunel stepping up to lead the French national team, he coached his last game at Bordeaux on 30 December 2017, losing away to Stade Français 22–12.\nFrance.\nOn 27 December 2017, Brunel was named as the new coach of the French national team after Guy Novès was sacked due to a series of poor results. Brunel's first match in charge, was a last minute loss to Ireland, losing 15–13, with a drop goal from Johnny Sexton three minutes into over time during the 2018 Six Nations Championship. The following week, in what was the first ever match where the Auld Alliance Trophy was contested, Scotland claimed the victory winning 32–26. Brunel gained his first victory in round 3, defeating Italy at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the first time France had taken a home game away from Paris during the Championship, to retain the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy. In round 4, France defeated England for the first time since 2015, running out 22–16 victors, and had it not been because of a defeat to Wales (14–13) in the final round, France could have finished second. However, their narrow loss meant they finished fourth, ahead of England and Italy in fifth and sixth. During the 2018 June rugby union tests, Brunel led France to a series whitewash against New Zealand, losing the first test 52–11, the second 26–13 and the third 49–14.\nThe 2018/19 International Season for France saw Brunel lead his nation to just three wins in eight matches, defeating Argentina during the 2018 November test window and Scotland and Italy during the 2019 Six Nations Championship; finishing fourth on the table. Despite this, the Championship was not without recorded for the French side, losing to Wales in the opening round after leading 16–0 at half time before going onto recording their biggest defeat to England, losing 44–8.\nOther honours.\nColomiers\nPau\nPerpignan\nFrance \"(as assistant coach)\""

It began with the ICC World Twenty20, which the West Indies won by defeating host nation Sri Lanka in the final. As a result, Sri Lanka and the West Indies rose to number one and two respectively in the ICC T20I Championship rankings. The season included the first bilateral series between India and Pakistan since 2007. Bilateral ties between the two countries had been severed since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\nIn Test cricket, South Africa had their first successful defences of the ICC Test Championship number-one ranking they acquired from England in August 2012. They started with winning a three-Test series 1–0 in Australia, and won all their home matches, against New Zealand and Pakistan. England won a Test series in India for the first time since 1984–85. It was also India's first Test series defeat at home since the 2004–05 season. India then bounced back with a 4–0 victory in a home Test series against a restructuring Australian team. This was a complete turnaround from their previous meeting in 2011–12, when India lost 0–4 in Australia. In series of three or more Tests, it was also the first whitewash against Australia since 1969–70.\nIn the ICC ODI Championship, South Africa dropped from number two to four after a home series loss to the ninth-ranked New Zealand. South Africa were experimenting with the make-up of their ODI squad at the time. India and England lost an ODI series each to leave them ranked number one and two respectively for the second half of the season. No team was able to perform well consistently ahead of the Champions Trophy to be held the following season."

        "text": "Otley Cricket Club is a member of Airedale &amp; Wharfedale Cricket League. The Club is based at Cross Green, Otley, West Yorkshire, England. The Club runs 3 Senior Sides and a full Junior Section ranging from Under 17 to Under 9.\nHistory.\nOne of the County's oldest cricket clubs, Otley CC was formed in 1820 although there are records that suggest that cricket was played in the town even before this date. Initially the club played on a ground now occupied by the cemetery and moved to its present Cross Green ground in 1862.\nFor the first 73 years of the club's existence it played friendly matched but in 1893 the Club took a huge step forward by becoming founder members of the Airedale &amp; Wharfedale Cricket League. The Club continued to play cricket in the League until after the First World War when in 1919 the Club joined the Yorkshire Council League. The Club played in this competition until 1936 when they joined the re-formed AWSCL. Otley instantly made their presence felt by winning the first of its league titles the following year.\nIn 1942, Otley won the AWSCL for the 2nd time, and also got their maiden win in the League's Cup competition with victory over Menston CC in the Waddilove Cup. During this period the Club had many successful players; H. Daphne, W. Bishop, J. Warburton, H. Bolton &amp; R. Scarr to name a few. The latter two would go on to write their names into the League record books. In 1943 the Club retained the Waddilove Cup with H. Daphne taking match winning figures of 7–22.\nFrom 1950 to 1980 saw the Club win 5 more Waddilove Cups, starting the careers of some of the finest cricketer's the Club has seen such as Mike Bailey, Barrie Crighton, Ray Beadle, John Harker, Steve Davies and Chris Smith. Smith has been at the forefront of everything going on at the Club ever since, with a hugely successful playing career spanning four decades and his more recent off field efforts with fundraising events and serving as the Club's current Chairman.\nDuring the period of the 1980s and the early '90s, the likes of Beadle, Smith, Davies and Wadkin led the Club's most successful period with numerous league and Cup triumphs. Thanks to a crop of highly talented juniors coming through such as Hill, Hunt, Conway, Davey, Chaplin and the Wolfenden brothers who pushed onto the 1st XI saw the Club win both 1st &amp; 2nd Team League titles, the Waddilove Cup and the Burmah Oil Trophy in 1988.\nThe trophies have dried up over the last 20 years, with defeats in the 2006 and 2008 Waddilove Cup Finals against Bilton and Kirkstall Educational and defeats in the Birtwhistle Cup Final in 2008 and 2009 both against Kirkstall.\nHonours.\n1st XI.\nAWSCL Division A :-\n1937, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1966(JOINT), 1974, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993\nWaddilove Cup:-\n1942, 1943, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1972, 1976, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1988\n2nd XI.\nAWSCL Division A:-\n1988, 1993, 2013\nBirtwhistle Cup:-\n1986, 1994\n3rd XI.\nAWSCL Champions:-\n2013,\nClub awards.\nBurmah Oil Trophy:-\n1974, 1986, 1988, 1993\n2013 season.\nOtley enjoyed a terrific season in 2013 with silverware being brought to Cross Green for the first time since 1994. The 2nd XI won Division A(Reserve League Champions) and were Runners-up to Guiseley in the Birtwhistle Cup. The 3rd XI also were Runners-up in the Chappell Cup, but won the Championship Play-off with victory over Adel. The 1st XI finished 3rd in Division A."

        "title": "World Series Hockey",
        "text": "World Series Hockey (WSH) was a professional league for field hockey competition in India. It was organised by Indian Hockey Federation with the objective to reinvigorate hockey in India. It was contested among eight franchise-based teams consisting of players from India and around the world. The entire event took place on home and away basis culminating into multi header playoffs. Australian Dennis Meredith, a member of the FIH panel of tournament directors, was the technical director of the WSH. It was sponsored by tyre manufacturers, Bridgestone, and therefore officially known as Bridgestone World Series Hockey.\nHistory.\nFirst season.\nThe inaugural season of WSH was to take place from 17 December 2011 to 22 January 2012, but later was postponed owing to Olympic qualifiers. It kicked off on 29 February amidst confusion and controversies when the Indian players opted out of the tournament and FIH, HI and PHF warned players looking to participate in the WSH that they will be suspended from international matches as the event was unsanctioned.\nA total of 59 matches were played in 34 days. The top four teams in the league phase advanced to the semi-finals followed by the final which was played in Mahindra Hockey Stadium, Mumbai. Sher-e-Punjab defeated Pune Strykers 5 – 2 to become the champions of the first WSH.\nSecond season.\nThe second season of World Series Hockey was supposed to be played from 15 December 2012 to 20 January 2013.\nCompetition format.\nRules.\nThe event was played according to the traditional hockey rules, apart from a few variations. All the matches were of 70 minutes, but instead of two-halves, the games are divided into four-quarters of 17-and-a-half minutes, to give more rest to players, and provide opportunities to sponsors and advertisers. Each team could have a maximum of 25 registered players, out of which 18 played. Time-outs (2 minutes) could be called once in each half. There were video umpires in all games. In the event that the referral is upheld, the referring team would retain its right. A penalty stroke was awarded in case of an intentional foul. The shoot-outs are used only in the knockout stage.\nLeague phase.\nEach team played the other twice; home and away. Top four teams qualify for the semi-finals. If at the end of the league phase two or more teams have the same number of points, these teams will be ranked according to the following criteria:\nPlayoffs.\nThe four teams with the best record after the league phase qualify for the playoffs. The winners of each playoff semis qualifies for the final.\nPlayers.\nEach team could have a maximum of 25 registered players. The tournament included Pakistani superstar and legend Waseem Ahmad along with seven other Pakistani players. The players were finalized on 28 November and 10 February based on the draft system. The captains of eight teams were announced at a media conference and the list includes four Indian players and four foreign players. WSH signed on eight world-renowned coaches to take charge of the teams.\nTrophy.\nTrophy of \"Bridgestone World Series Hockey\" comprised a large cup with two hockey sticks on either sides. The trophy was unveiled by actor Saif Ali Khan, Viren Rasquinha, Prabhjot Singh, Arjun Halappa and Rajpal Singh at a press conference in Mumbai.\nSponsorship.\nTyre manufacturers Bridgestone became the title sponsors of World Series Hockey for the inaugural season. Other major sponsors of the league included Vodafone and Seagram's Imperial Blue.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for WSH was at the time the highest prize money for any hockey event in the \nworld, 30 times more than the Euro Hockey League. The total prize money was excess of 100 million Indian rupees. \nIf an Indian player becomes \"WSH Rockstar\", the prize for the \"Indian Superstar\" will be awarded to the next best Indian player. All WSH franchises have committed to share a minimum of 50% of their team winnings with the players.\nBrand ambassador.\nBollywood actor Suniel Shetty is appointed as the brand ambassador for the World Series Hockey.\nStatistics.\nTop scorers.\nThe top goal scorer of the league is awarded with golden stick and a prize money of 2.5 million ( 25,000). Apart from this, 5,000 is given to the players for the goal of the match. Champion team Sher-e-Punjab holds the record for most goals scored (54 in 16 matches). Delhi Wizards and Bhopal Badshahs have conceded the fewest goals (37 in 14 matches).\nThe highest-scoring matches to date in the World Series Hockey occurred twice: Pune Strykers beat Mumbai Marines and Delhi defeated Punjab. Both the matches ended up 7–5. Out of Pune's 7 goals, 5 were scored by Gurpreet Singh, which is also the most goals scored in a WSH match by an individual.\nTechnical committee.\nThe technical committee for World Series Hockey included Dennis Meredith, former Indian coach Joaquim Carvolho, former captain and one of the best goalkeepers of India Ashish Ballal, former Chairman of the International Hockey Federation umpiring committee Peter Von Reth, M.P. Ganesh, Shahbaz Ahmed and Zafar Iqbal.\n1996 Atlanta Olympics Indian goalkeeper Alloysius Edwards was chosen as one of the managers of the World Series Hockey, whereas sports medicine expert P. S. M. Chandran, involved with multiple sports at the international level for more than three decades, was elected as chief medical officer.\nControversies.\nThe IHF has not been recognised by the International Hockey Federation as the governing body for the sport in India. Instead, the FIH recognises Hockey India as the sole national governing body for the sport. It remained an unsanctioned event as per the FIH statutes.\nPakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has said that any player who participates in the WSH will be banned from domestic competitions. FIH wrote a letter to PHF which clearly stated that the league is unsanctioned and its players would not take part. Earlier, the FIH had stated that those who had signed their contracts before 28 March 2011 could play in the league, but situation has changed. Apart from Rehan, Zeeshan Ashraf, Mudassar Ali, Tariq Aziz, Adnan Maqsood, Waseem Ahmad, Syed Imran Warsi and Shakeel Abbasi were signed to play in WSH.\nFIH president Leandro Negre served a direct warning to players looking to participate in the WSH that they will be suspended from international matches. The entire Indian squad signed a contract to play in the league but Negre made it clear that any Indian player who participates will be banned from the Olympic qualifiers and all FIH tournaments.\nFormer Indian coach Harendra Singh criticized the FIH and Hockey India over interfering in a domestic tournament and stopping players from participating in the WSH. According to him, playing matches is more beneficial for the players than attending camps for the Olympic qualifiers.\nOn 30 November, six top Indian players pulled out of the league in favor of the national camp for the Olympic qualifiers. In a letter, addressed to Hockey India secretary Narinder Batra and signed by skipper Bharat Chettri, Tushar Khandekar, Yuvraj Walmiki, Sreejesh, Sandeep Singh and Sardar Singh, the players said they would be available for selection. The WSH, however, said that they were yet to get communication from any WSH player regarding their non-availability for the inaugural edition.\nOn 1 December, six more Indian players pulled out of the World Series Hockey, citing national camp that would coincide with the league start. The six players - Rupinder Pal Singh, Danish Mujtaba, Kangujam Chinglensana Singh, Manjeet Kullu, Birendra Lakra and Manpreet Singh - in a letter assured the Hockey India that they would attend the national camp.\nSources claimed that coach requested Hockey India to postpone camp from 11 December to sometime in January so that national players can feature in inaugural World Series Hockey. Organisers of the WSH have said they are open to postponing the event by three months, till after the Olympic Qualification tournament. The organisers postponed the event with condition of written guarantee from HI and an assurance that they will allow all the players to participate in the tournament after the qualifiers.\nThe tournament got clearance from Delhi High Court on 13 February, adding that the schedule did not clash with international commitments of the national team.\n18 players of the Indian team that qualified for the Olympics decided to skip the league after a team meeting. International Hockey Federation said that it can sanction the WSH only if the two organisations, Hockey India and Indian Hockey Federation, reach an agreement."

The series consisted of 4 continental championships (European, Pan American, Oceania and Asian), 3 world cup races and the world championships.\nFinal standings.\nThe winner of each world cup race was awarded 30 points. Semifinalists were guaranteed at least 5 points and paddlers eliminated in heats received 2 points each. The continental championships had a lesser status with the winner earning 20 points, semifinalists at least 2 points and all others were awarded 1 point for participation. Because the continental championships were not open to all countries, every athlete could only compete in one of them. The world championships points scale was the same as for the world cups multiplied by a factor of 1.5. That meant the world champion earned 45 points, semifinalists got at least 7.5 points and paddlers eliminated in heats received 3 points apiece.

        "title": "Trinidad and Tobago at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but is normally referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nTrinidad and Tobago have qualified for the final stages of the FIFA World Cup on one occasion, in 2006, when they qualified for the tournament in Germany, but were eliminated at the group stage. Trinidad and Tobago became the smallest nation in terms of population to reach the finals of a World Cup tournament, a feat previously held by Northern Ireland since their first World Cup appearance at the 1958 World Cup. This record was held until Iceland qualified for the first time in 2018.\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nQualification.\nOn 12 October 2005, Trinidad and Tobago secured fourth place in the CONCACAF final qualification round, and therefore participated in a playoff with the fifth place Asian team Bahrain for a chance to enter the 2006 World Cup. After a 1–1 draw in Port of Spain, the team beat Bahrain 1–0, with a Dennis Lawrence header in Manama, to clinch their first ever qualification for the World Cup finals.\nSquad.\nSilvio Spann was originally in the squad, but had to drop-out after sustaining a hamstring injury in the run-up to the tournament. He was replaced by Evans Wise. Head coach of Trinidad and Tobago's 2006 World Cup squad was Leo Beenhakker.\nFinals Matches.\nTrinidad and Tobago were drawn in Group B along with England, Sweden and Paraguay.\nIn their first match, Trinidad and Tobago held a strong Swedish side to a 0–0 draw, despite having Avery John sent off less than 30 seconds into the second half. Team captain Dwight Yorke won \"Man of the Match\" honours.\nTrinidad and Tobago lost their second game of the group stage to England 2–0. Late goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard secured England a place in the second round.\nTrinidad had hoped for a draw between Paraguay and Sweden for their best chances of getting second place but Sweden defeated Paraguay 1–0.\nTrinidad and Tobago lost their third and final game of Group B to Paraguay 2–0. An own goal from Brent Sancho put them behind early in the game, and Paraguay scored a second goal late in the match from Nelson Cuevas.\nTrinidad and Tobago finished last in Group B with one point, and were eliminated. They were the only team in the 2006 World Cup not to score a goal.\nSupport.\nThe Tartan Army, supporters of Scottish football, lent their support to Trinidad and Tobago, partly since they were opponents to England and also due to six of the squad members playing for Scottish clubs.\nAftermath.\nOn their return from Germany, the government awarded Leo Beenhakker and each member of the squad the country's second highest honour, the Chaconia Medal, Gold, plus TT$1,000,000 (one quarter in cash, the rest in unit trusts). As captain, Dwight Yorke was awarded TT$1,250,000, while players who had participated in qualification but not in Germany were awarded TT$250,000. Ten members of the teams' technical staff were also later awarded TT$250,000.\nOn 6 October 2006, thirteen of the players in the 2006 World Cup squad indicated their intention to retire from international football after friendly matches against St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Panama on 7 October and 11 October, respectively. The players alleged that the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation had reneged on various contractual commitments to the team. This was upheld by the Trinidadian High Court in March 2011, who ordered that an interim payment of $1.14m should be made.\nRecord players.\nNine players were fielded in all three of Trinidad and Tobago's matches in 2006, making them record World Cup appearance makers for their country."

        "text": "The El Salvador national football team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup final tournament on two occasions, the first time in 1970 in Mexico and the second time in 1982 in Spain. El Salvador has played in six group stage matches, losing all six and never advancing to the knockout stage.\nEl Salvador qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the first FIFA World Cup the country qualified for. During qualification, El Salvador played Honduras over three matches in June 1969, with El Salvador advancing to the next round of CONCACAF qualification. The matches between El Salvador and Honduras increased political tensions between both countries, resulting the outbreak of the Football War in July 1969 causing over 2,000 deaths. After defeating Haiti over three matches, El Salvador qualified. El Salvador lost all three matches it played against Belgium, Mexico, and the Soviet Union and failed to score a goal.\nEl Salvador next qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup as runners-up of the 1981 CONCACAF Championship. As occurred in 1970, El Salvador lost all three of its matches against Hungary, Belgium, and Argentina. The match against Hungary resulted in the largest defeat in FIFA World Cup history when El Salvador lost by a score of 10–1. El Salvador's lone goal in the match, scored by Luis Ramírez Zapata in the 64th minute, remains the only goal scored by El Salvador at the FIFA World Cup.\nSince 1970, El Salvador has participated in every FIFA World Cup qualification but has failed to qualify for another FIFA World Cup since 1982. The country has selected 42 players to play at the FIFA World Cup across both times it qualified, 17 of which are tied for making the most appearances for El Salvador at 3 appearances each. Hernán Carrasco was the country's manager in 1970 while Mauricio Rodríguez was the manager in 1982. El Salvador is ranked 80th (last place) all-time for its performance at the FIFA World Cup by the Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation.\nHistory.\n1970 Mexico.\nQualification.\nEl Salvador entered FIFA World Cup qualification for the first time for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. During the first round of CONCACAF qualifiers, El Salvador was drawn into a double round-robin group against Suriname and Netherlands Antilles, winning all four of its matches. El Salvador advanced to the second round with three wins and one loss.\nDuring the second round, El Salvador played Honduras in a two-legged tie. Prior to the matches, tensions were high between the Salvadoran and Honduran governments regarding the status of 300,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador who were living and working in Honduras. Hondurans saw the Salvadoran immigrants as taking Honduran land and economically crippling the country, and the Honduran government announced in April 1969 that it would expel people who had acquired property under an agrarian reform who could not prove that they were Honduran citizens by birth.\nIn the first leg, held in Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969, Honduras defeated El Salvador by a score of 1–0. Reports were made that hostility between fans was present during the match. In the second leg, held in San Salvador on 15 June 1969, El Salvador defeated Honduras by a score of 3–0. Before the match, Salvadorans harassed the Honduran players as they were sleeping and the Honduran national flag was desecrated. The defeat and actions by Salvadorans resulted in rioting in Honduran towns where many Salvadorans were killed and thousands fled the country; the Salvadoran government condemned the deaths as a \"genocide\" and demanded reparations. A third leg was held in Mexico City on 27 June 1969 as both teams had won a match; El Salvador defeated Honduras by a score of 3–2 after an extra time goal by Pipo Rodríguez in the 101st minute. Following the match, Honduras severed all diplomatic ties with El Salvador, and on 14 July 1969, the Salvadoran Army invaded Honduras beginning the Football War. The war ended on 20 July 1969 after the Organization of American States (OAS) negotiated a cease fire. The war killed over 2,000 people.\nAfter defeating Honduras in the third leg, El Salvador played a two-legged tie against Haiti; El Salvador defeated Haiti 2–1 in Port-au-Prince on 21 September 1969 and then Haiti defeated El Salvador 3–0 in San Salvador on 28 September 1969. A third leg was held in Kingston, Jamaica on 8 October 1969 as both teams had won a match, where El Salvador defeated Haiti 1–0 in extra time. With the victory, El Salvador qualified for its first ever FIFA World Cup and became the first Central American country to qualify for the tournament.\nFinal tournament.\nFor the 1970 FIFA World Cup, El Salvador was drawn into Group 1 along with Belgium, Mexico (the tournament's host), and the Soviet Union. El Salvador's squad consisted of 22 players. Chilean Hernán Carrasco was the manager and Salvador Mariona was the captain.\nEl Salvador lost their first match against Belgium on 3 June 1982 by a score of 3–0; Wilfried Van Moer and Raoul Lambert scored Belgium's goals. In its second match against Mexico on 7 June 1970, El Salvador lost by a score of 4–0; Javier Valdivia (scored twice), Javier Fragoso, and Juan Ignacio Basaguren scored Mexico's goals. In El Salvador's final match, it lost to the Soviet Union by a score of 2–0 on 10 June 1970; both goals for the Soviet Union were scored by Anatoliy Byshovets. El Salvador lost every match, failed to score a goal, and failed to advance to the knockout stage.\n1982 Spain.\nQualification.\nQualification for the 1982 FIFA World Cup was determined via the 1981 CONCACAF Championship. During the tournament, El Salvador won two matches, drew two, and lost one. Both Honduras, the tournament's winner, and El Salvador, the runner-up, both qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nFinal tournament.\nFor the 1982 FIFA World Cup, El Salvador was drawn into Group 3 along with Argentina, Belgium, and Hungary. El Salvador's squad consisted of 20 players, rather than the 22 allowed as Salvadoran officials decided to bring some \"cronies\" in their place. The players were outraged once they found out and attempted to raise money to help Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González (the two players left behind) come to Spain, but their effort failed as they were not able to raise enough money. Mauricio Rodríguez, who played for El Salvador at the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was the manager and Norberto Huezo was the captain.\nAccording to a survey conducted by a Salvadoran radio station before El Salvador's first match against Hungary, 60 percent of respondents believed that El Salvador would win its first match. On 15 June 1982, Hungary defeated El Salvador by a score of 10–1, inflicting the heaviest defeat in El Salvador's history as well as the heaviest defeat in FIFA World Cup history. Hungary's 10 goals, which remains the record for the most goals scored by a team in a single match at the FIFA World Cup, were scored by Tibor Nyilasi (scored twice), Gábor Pölöskei, László Fazekas (scored twice), József Tóth, László Kiss (who scored a hat-trick), and Lázár Szentes. Meanwhile, Luis Ramírez Zapata scored El Salvador's lone goal in the 64th minute. His goal remains the only goal ever scored by El Salvador at the FIFA World Cup. According to Ramírez, his teammates told him to not celebrate the goal he scored as they were \"afraid that it would make Hungary angry\" and result in El Salvador conceding more goals. After the match, three players—Huezo, Francisco Jovel, and Ramón Fagoaga—announced that they would determine the team's tactics for its next two matches instead of Rodríguez.\nIn El Salvador's second match, the team lost by a score of 1–0 to Belgium. Ludo Coeck scored the match's lone goal in the 19th minute. Prior to the match, Belgian manager Guy Thys described El Salvador's loss to Hungary as \"the most shameful\" to ever occur at the FIFA World Cup. El Salvador lost their final match to Argentina by a score of 2–0; Daniel Passarella and Daniel Bertoni scored Argentina's goals. El Salvador lost all three matches, scored only one goal, and failed to advance to the knockout stage.\nRecord at the FIFA World Cup.\nThe following table displays El Salvador's all-time results for the FIFA World Cup and FIFA World Cup qualification. El Salvador is ranked 80th (last place) all-time for its performance at the FIFA World Cup.\nRecords and statistics.\nMost appearances.\nA total of 42 players have been selected to play for El Salvador at the FIFA World Cup, of which, 33 have played in at least one match and 30 of which have started at least one match. A total of 17 players are tied for having the most appearances at the FIFA World Cup (8 from 1970 and 9 from 1980), appearing in three matches each.\nTop goalscorers.\nIn six matches at the FIFA World Cup, El Salvador has only scored a single goal, scored by Zapata against Hungary in 1982."

Red Sox owner Ed Barrow convinced Traynor to join Portsmouth, saying that if the third baseman performed well there, he would join the Red Sox, as the Boston team and Portsmouth had a gentleman's agreement, wherein Portsmouth served as something of a farm team for the Red Sox.\nHowever, the Truckers were still an independent team and, despite the informal agreement, were able to do anything they wished with Traynor, including selling him to another team. In September 1920, they sold him to the Pittsburgh Pirates, infuriating Burrow. \"I hit the ceiling. I grabbed the phone and called Dawson and called him everything I could think of\", Burrow said. Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith, too, was unhappy, claiming he thought his team would gain access to Traynor.\nIncident.\nIn July 1934, while business and general manager of the Norfolk Tars, Dawson was arrested, along with team manager Bill Skiff and pitcher Ray White, for striking a police officer and resisting arrest during a squabble over a disputed home run call. He was neither fined or imprisoned."

        "title": "2011–12 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2011–12 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2011–2012 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Huskies were coached by Geno Auriemma, and played their home games at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies are a member of the Big East Conference.\nOffseason.\nItaly trip.\nThe UConn team traveled to Italy, for a ten-day trip, combining exhibition basketball, and sightseeing. The team, along with the coaching staff and fans left the US on 16 August 2011, and arrived in Rome the following morning. After landing, everyone boarded a bus, which took them to Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, one of the four great ancient major basilicas of Rome. The bus then continued to some of the other classic sites of Rome, including Circus Maximus and the Colosseum. The next day started with sightseeing; a visit to Vatican City, including St. Peter's Basilica, and the Sistine Chapel. In the evening, it was time for basketball, as the UConn team took on the Netherlands national team. The game was close at the half, with the Huskies up only by two points, 34–32, but UConn held the Dutch team scoreless for the first seven minutes of the second half, and won easily, 73–53.\nOn the third day of the trip, the team started as tourists, visiting the Pantheon and the Spanish Steps. In the evening, the team played the Italian Select team, and won easily 98–52. Incoming freshman Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis had a stretch where she sank five consecutive three-point attempts, which extended a lead to 32 points by the end of the third quarter. The next day, the team took a bus trip to Villa d'Este, and spent the day touring the grounds of the 16th-century estate outside Rome, used as a retreat by Cardinals and Popes of the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe fifth day of the trip was all cultural, starting with a bus ride to Florence and a stop to your Accademia Gallery, home of many famous paintings and sculptures, the most famous of which is Michelangelo's David. The group then did a walking tour of central Florence, including a walk around the Duomo of Florence. The next stop was a visit to Galleria degli Uffizi to view the art treasures.\nThe sixth day featured basketball, a game between UConn and the TDT Slammers from Germany. The game was never close, and UConn ended up with a 112–36 win. Five players scored in double figures, including Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Tiffany Hayes, Bria Hartley, Briana Banks, and Heather Buck. The team appreciated playing indoors; the temperature reached 112 degrees during the day. The next day featured a bus trip to Pisa, to visit the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa.\nOn the eighth day, the team started with a bus trip to Lake Como. The original schedule included a game against the Nigerian National team, but there were difficulties with visas, so the team did not arrive. UConn played the first quarter against the same team, the TDT Slammers, that they had played in Florence, then played the last three quarters against Castellanza Select, a local club team. Tiffany Hayes was one rebound and one assist short of a triple-double in the 116–33 against the over-matched teams. The last full day in Italy featured a boat trip on Lake Como and strolls through Bellagio. The following day, the team returned to the US.\nRoster changes.\nTwo players graduated, Lorin Dixon and Maya Moore. Although Dixon was not a starter, she averaged almost 22 minutes per game, sixth most among all players, and played a major role in the NCAA semi-final win over Georgetown. The loss of Moore is far more significant, as she was selected as the WNBA number one pick, and went on to help the Minnesota Lynx win their first WNBA championship.\nConnecticut's incoming class of freshman included three players: Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks, and Kiah Stokes. The incoming class was rated the number two recruiting class, by ESPN. Mosqueda-Lewis, from California, was the 2011 State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year. Banks is a left-handed guard from Georgia, with an overall rank of 24 in the 2011 class. Stokes is a 6'3 post player from Iowa, with an overall ranking of 42 within the 2011 class.\nPre-season.\nConnecticut played two exhibition games in the warm up to the regular season. The first was played November 3 against Assumption College, from Worcester, Massachusetts. Five UConn players scored in double digits, including Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis who hit five of nine three-point attempts in her first game wearing a UConn uniform. UConn won the game 89–30. Six days later, UConn played Pace University from New York City. Tiffany Hayes lead all scorers with 24 points, helping the UConn team to an 85–35 win.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference games.\nUConn opened their season at their campus home court, against Holy Cross. The game featured the return of Caroline Doty, who missed the entire previous season due to injury. Bria Hartley and Tiffany Hayes lead the scoring with 17 and 16 points respectively. The Huskies won the game 87–37. In their next game, UConn tied a record with 68 points in the first half against Pacific. The Huskies hit 71% of their basket attempts in the first half, and opened up a 43-point lead. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis went on to score 25 points on ten for twelve shooting. Four other Huskies scored in double digits, leading to a 112–53 victory over the Pacific team playing their 999th game.\nThe game against Stanford represented the first major test of the season; the Huskies were ranked #2 in the AP ratings and Stanford #3. The Stanford team ended the Connecticut winning streak at 90 games in the prior-season matchup. UConn won the game 68–58, behind 25 points by freshman Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, and a defensive effort that inspired coach Geno Auriemma to remark, \"That's one of the better defensive efforts I’ve seen us have in a long time.\"\nUConn held Fairleigh Dickinson University to five first-half points, the lowest point total ever scored by an opponent in a half, but the game did not earn praise from coach Auriemma, \"It was the worst exhibition of basketball I've ever seen by two teams in my 27 years at UConn. They should give everyone a refund.\" The final score in the first game of the World Vision Classic was 74–28.\nTiffany Hayes completed a double-double, with double digits scoring and double digit rebounds, the first such accomplishment of her career, well timed because Connecticut Sun head coach Mike Thibault and assistant coach Scott Hawk were watching from the sidelines. Hayes 30 points was a career high, helping the Huskies to a 90–34 victory over the Buffalo in the second game of the World Vision Classic.\nUConn beat Dayton in the final game of the World Vision Classic by a score of 78–38. The win was also a milestone; the team has now won 89 consecutive home games, an NCAA all division record, snapping the 88 game streak set by Rust College in 1989.\nBria Hartley scored 24 points on nine for twelve shooting to help the Huskies defeat Towson University 92–31 November 30 in a game at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Hartford. Hartley was not the only player shooting well. Heather Buck hit both shots she attempted, while Tiffany Hayes, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis and Stefanie Dolson each shot better than 70% from the field. The game was never competitive, and UConn would go on to win 92–31. However, the game was not without a potential downside; Caroline Doty suffered a head and neck injury in the first half sufficiently serious to keep her in the locker room for the second half, although she would return to the line-up for the next game.\nThe game against Texas A&amp;M matched UConn against the second top ten team of the season. The pregame started with Stefanie Dolson leading the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance. Connecticut held the defending National Champions to just over 32% field goal shooting, leading A&amp;M coach Gary Blair to comment, \"We're not ready for this kind of competition\". The Huskies won by thirty points, with a final score of 81–51.\nThe game between Baylor University and UConn matched up the top two ranked teams in the country. Connecticut went to halftime with a six-point lead, and built the lead to eleven in the second half, but Brittney Griner scored 25 points along with nine blocks to bring Baylor back into the lead, and Baylor went on to win the game, 66–61, handing UConn its first loss of the season.\nUConn played College of Charleston in Charleston December 21, the last game before Christmas break. Although the Huskies had a 19-point lead at halftime, the 27 points scored was the lowest first half total of the season. The second half featured more scoring by Connecticut, as they scored 45 points in the second half, en route to a 72–24 victory. The win, following the loss to Baylor, represented the 665th game without back-to-back losses. The current streak stretches back to March 1993. By comparison, the second longest streak is held by Duke University, who have won 142 games without consecutive losses.\nThe Fairfield Stags entered the game against UConn on a four-game winning streak, but lost 93–40, representing the largest margin of defeat in a decade.\nAfter playing five conference games, UConn hosted North Carolina, one of the three remaining non-conference games. The game against North Carolina was held on Martin Luther King day, and has been an annual occurrence for many years. In the first seven match ups between the two teams, the Tarheels won five, but the Huskies have won the last five games. Although the North Carolina team was ranked in the top 25, the UConn team handed them their worst loss in history, defeating them 86–35 for a margin of over 50 points.\nConference games.\nUConn opened conference play against Seton Hall. The UConn team scored the first 20 points of the game. After two free throws by Seton Hall, the huskies reeled off ten more points before giving up their first basket. Although the scoring would be roughly even from that point on, the game result was never in doubt. UConn won by a final score of 70–37.\nIn the first game of the new year, UConn faced West Virginia in Hartford. The UConn team won 79–60, but the contest featured many fouls—there were a total of 36 fouls called on both teams. At the press conference following the game, coach Auriemma remarked,\"I'll take questions, but I sure don't have no answers.\"\nThe next game matched the number two and number three ranked teams in the country, with UConn playing at Notre Dame. The game was close throughout, with UConn holding a slim two-point lead in the final minute, but Notre Dame forced overtime, and out scored the Huskies by seven points in the extra period, to win 74–67. It was the first Huskies regular season Big East loss after 57 consecutive victories. The Huskies rebounded from their loss with a win over Providence, in which every one of the eleven players scored. The team was shooting over 70% from the floor in the first half, and went on to win 96–35.\nIn their next game, against Villanova, the home team had an early lead at 15–11 when the Huskies scored 15 consecutive points as part of a 21–2 run to take a large lead. Villanova got with five points in the second half, but the Huskies responded with a 17–5 run, helping them to a comfortable margin, and a 72–49 victory.\nUConn returned to conference play with their match up against Cincinnati, coached by Jamelle Elliott, former long-time assistant at Connecticut. Although the Bearcats had started the season with six straight victories, they were now playing tougher competition, and had lost eight of their last eleven games. Dayeesha Hollins scored the first 13 points for Cincinnati, and was single-handedly keeping the game in reach, but UConn pulled away, and won easily 80–37.\nThe next game featured a ranked opponent in DePaul, although since losing senior Keisha Hampton, they aren’t the same team that earned the ranking. Oft-injured Caroline Doty came out of the game with a knee injury in the first half and did not return to the game. The Huskies had three scoring runs of double-digit consecutive points to help put away the Blue Demons, and come away with the win, 88–44. UConn then traveled to Syracuse, where the Orange kept the game close in the first half, ending the half only seven points behind the Huskies. However, behind a career-high 35 points from Tiffany Hayes, the UConn team pulled away in the second half to a 95–54 victory.\nThe UConn team played the University of South Florida in front of 13,627 fans on Saturday, January 28. The date is Jasper Howard's birthday, a cornerback for the UConn football team, before being fatally stabbed in 2009. He was a friend of Tiffany Hayes, who brought a hat of his to the media session and spoke of his inspiration. The USF team has never beaten the Huskies, but was behind only by three points at halftime, and scored early in the second half to cut the margin to a single point. However, Hayes and Stefanie Dolson combined to give the team a large lead. Hayes scored 33 points, and Dolson added 22 to help the team to a 77–62 final score. Hayes has scored 68 points in the last two games, setting an all-time UConn record for scoring in consecutive games.\nUConn next faced Rutgers, who were playing without star player Khadijah Rushdan, who was sitting out recovering from a concussion. Rutgers Hall of Fame head coach C. Vivian Stringer is known for her defense, so her comments about the UConn defense \"They play the passing lanes and pressure the ball. They play personnel as well as anyone I’ve seen. They do a great job.\" were respected. UConn held Rutgers to 34 points, the fewest ever scored in a game between the two teams. UConn won the game 66–34, extending the consecutive home winning streak to 98 games.\nThe next game pitted UConn against a Louisville team with a twelve-game home winning streak, who bought 16,418 fans to the arena. UConn started slowly, and Bria Hartley picked up two early fouls. The team outscored the Cardinals 24–9 in the last twelve minutes of the first half, opening up a lead that stretched to more than 20 at one point. However, the Cardinals fought back in the second half, at one time cutting the lead to six, but held on and won with a final score of 56–46.\nIn the next game, against Georgetown, the Hoyas had an early 12–11 lead, but then the defense of the Huskies went to work and held the Georgetown team to a game total of 38 points. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who had been struggling with her shooting, scored a team high 23 points, helping to lead the team to an 80–38 final score.\nSchedule.\nThe XL Center is the Veterans Memorial Coliseum at XL Center\nε\nExhibition\nβ\nBig East\nBig East tournament.\nThe 2012 Big East tournament was held at the XL Center. The opening rounds proceeded largely as expected, with the Marquette victory over Cincinnati the only upset in the first two rounds. Both Villanova and South Florida won by a single point each.\nIn the quarterfinals, second seeded St. Johns beat Louisville in Overtime 68–61. Both Notre Dame and Connecticut won by 15, with Notre Dame beating DePaul 69–54, and UConn beating Rutgers in a low scoring game, 49–34. The defensive battle of the day was between West Virginia and Georgetown. Both teams were 11–5 in conference, but Georgetown was the higher seed, and nationally ranked. West Virginia achieved a mild upset, in a very low scoring game 39–32.\nNeither semifinal game was close. Both games featured a match up between a top-ranked team which had lost to an unranked (at the time) team. Notre Dame had only one loss in Big East play, but in the rematch, handled West Virginia easily, winning by a margin of 28 points, 73–45. Connecticut, which had lost to St. Johns a week earlier, ending a 99-game home win streak, beat the Red Storm by 31 points, 74–43.\nThe finals featured Notre Dame and Connecticut, the same teams as had played in the 2011 Championship game. Connecticut won that game, but Notre Dame had won three consecutive match ups since that game, defeating Connecticut in the semifinals of the Final Four, and the two regular season match ups in 2012. In the rematch, Connecticut opened up a ten-point lead in the first half, but Notre Dame responded, and cut the margin to a single point at halftime. Connecticut only scored two points in the opening of the second half, and fans remembered that UConn had gone almost nine minutes without scoring in the previous match up. However, UConn went on a run, helped by two three-pointers from Kelly Faris and 19 points from Mosqueda -Lewis, and went on to win the 2012 Big East tournament championship 63–54. Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley were named to the All-Tournament team, and Mosqueda-Lewis was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament.\nThe victory was also a personal milestone for coach Auriemma, representing the 800th win of his career. No one in NCAA basketball history has reached 800 wins in fewer total games.\nNCAA tournament.\nPrairie View.\nConnecticut started the first game like they have in so many other first-round games, looking like a potential blowout. UConn scored the first eight points, before Prairie View hit an awkward three-pointer off the glass. However, The Lady Panthers would stay relatively close in the first half, cutting the lead to eight well into the game. Senior Tiffany Hayes, nursing a stress injury, would pay 17 minutes in the first half, but would sit out the second half. Freshman Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis stepped up, scoring 21 points, tying a UConn record for points in their first NCAA appearance, held by former UConn player and current Cincinnati coach Jamelle Elliott. UConn stretched out the lead in the second half and won 83–47.\nKansas State.\nAfter Connecticut scored the first basket of the game, Kansas State responded with a three-pointer taking a 3–2 lead. It would be their last point for over eleven minutes, and their last lead of the game. UConn played a game described as \"nearly...flawless defensive game\". The Wildcats scored just before halftime to increase their point total to ten, narrowly missing a tie for fewest points in the first half of an NCAA tournament game. They would not be so fortunate in avoiding the complete game record, set by Southern when they scored only 27 points in a game. The Kansas State team reached 26 points with almost three minutes left to play, but would not score again. The Huskies won 72–26.\nPenn State.\nPenn State's Alex Bentley was asked about UConn after their win over Kansas State, and she said \"I don't think [the Huskies] played against a real, true scoring team\". UConn held the two guards, Bentley and Lucas to seven made shots on 31 attempts. In one notable sequence, Kelly Faris leaped to block a three-point attempt by Lucas. Caroline Doty grabbed the ball, and, with her back to her own basket and closely covered, leapt and spun to heave the ball to a streaking Faris, who had to be fouled hard to prevent a score. Bria Hartley would lead all scorers with 20 points, while Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis had a double-double in points and rebounds off the bench. The game was the 100th NCAA tournament game in UConn history. UConn has a record of 84–16 in NCAA tournament games.\nKentucky.\nConnecticut opened with a 9–0 run, but Kentucky did not quit, and responded, first closing the gap, then taking a small lead. When the Wildcats hit two free throws with 2.1 seconds in the first half to make the score 39 all, it looked like the score would be tied at halftime, but Tiffany Hayes hit a streaking Kelly Faris who put in a shot at the halftime buzzer to take a two-point lead. In the second half, the Huskies expanded the margin to 20 points, then ended with a 15-point victory, 80–65, to propel the UConn team to their fifth consecutive Final Four, tying an NCAA record.\nNotre Dame.\nConnecticut met Notre Dame for the third time this season. Notre Dame won by seven points on their home court, then won by twenty points at the XL Center in Hartford.UConn responded with a nine-point victory in the Big East championship game. \nThe Huskies held a slim three-point lead at halftime, while both teams took turns leading in the second half. Notre dame had a four-point lead with two minutes to go when Kelly Faris hit a layup to cut the margin to two, then sank two free throws to tie it with 44 seconds to go, then stole the ball and sank two more free throws to give UConn a two-point lead at the 11 second mark. Skyler Diggins missed a jump shot, but Natalie Novasel grabbed the rebound and hit a layup to send the game to overtime.\nIn the overtime, Diggins hit a three-pointer, then Brittany Mallory hit back-to-back three-pointers to give the Irish enough points for the win. Notre Dame won the game, 83–75."

        "text": "The 2011–12 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University in the 2011–12 college basketball season. Their head coach was Tom Crean, in his fourth season with the Hoosiers. The team played its home games at Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 27–9 overall and 11–7 in Big Ten play. They advanced to the second round of the 2012 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament before falling to Wisconsin. They received an at-large bid in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they advanced to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" before falling to eventual champion Kentucky.\nPreseason.\nCoach Tom Crean signed a three-man class in 2011.\nSeason.\nOn December 10, 2011, top-ranked Kentucky traveled to Bloomington to take on unranked Indiana. Indiana fans sensed a resurgence in the program and possible upset, with students lining up outside the arena 10 hours before tipoff to get good seats. The game remained close and hard-fought, with five lead changes in the final 121 seconds. At the last second, Christian Watford hit a 3-pointer, giving the Hoosiers a stunning 73–72 upset. Victor Oladipo had 13 points and five Hoosiers wound up in double figures. Watford's shot sent Indiana fans storming the court and crowding around players. Kentucky's loss was their only one of the regular season and prevented them from matching a record last set by Indiana's 1975–1976 team.\nVideo of Indiana fans reacting to the shot around the country went viral. ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, who was covering the game for the network, said it was the \"best game of the year\" and that \"[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot.\" According to Bob Kravitz, the win marked \"a day when Hoosier Hysteria was restored to something akin to its former glory.\"\nOn December 31, 2011, the Hoosiers knocked off 2nd ranked Ohio State and in doing so became the first IU team in history to knock off the top 2 team ranked teams in the same season. On February 28, 2012 they again beat a Top 5 team by beating No. 5 Michigan State, and became the first IU team since the undefeated 1975–76 team to beat 3 Top 5 teams in the same year. The Hoosiers earned a number four seed in the 2012 NCAA tournament and defeated New Mexico State in the second round. After defeating VCU in the third round, the Hoosiers however would go on to lose to eventual champion Kentucky in the Sweet Sixteen 102–90, as the Wildcats avenged their lone regular season loss.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=12| Big Ten Regular Season\n!colspan=9| Big Ten Conference tournament\n!colspan=9| 2012 NCAA tournament\n\"The Movement\".\nThe 2012 class consists of Yogi Ferrell, Hanner Perea, Jeremy Hollowell, Peter Jurkin, and Ron Patterson."

Born in Alameda, California, he stood tall and weighed as an active player.\nMacdonald signed his first professional contract with the Detroit Tigers and spent 1947–48 in their farm system. After winning 15 games during the latter season for the Flint Arrows of the Class A Central League, Macdonald was declared a free agent by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler on October 27, 1948; three months later, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, the Pirate affiliate in the Double-A Southern Association. In 1949, he posted a 13–11 record with the Pelicans and made the Pirates' roster out of spring training in 1950.\nAs a rookie, he appeared in 32 games, twenty as a starting pitcher, and won eight of 18 decisions, with six complete games and two shutouts. In his second MLB game, on May 23, he threw a complete game, three-hitter and blanked the eventual National League champion Philadelphia Phillies, 6–0 at Shibe Park.\nMacdonald missed the entire 1951–52 seasons due to military service. When he returned to baseball in 1953, he pitched ineffectively for the Pirates during the season's early weeks and spent much of the campaign with the Hollywood Stars of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League. He left baseball after the 1954 minor league season.\nAll told, in 160 Major League innings pitched, Macdonald gave up 150 hits and 96 bases on balls; he struck out 64."

        "text": "Justin Carl Fontaine (born November 6, 1987) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Minnesota Wild.\nPlaying career.\nFontaine attended the University of Minnesota Duluth where he played four seasons (2007–2011) of NCAA college hockey with the Minnesota–Duluth Bulldogs.\nOn April 19, 2011, the Minnesota Wild signed Fontaine as a free agent to an entry-level contract. In the 2013–14 season, Fontaine scored his first NHL goal on October 12, 2013 against Dan Ellis of the Dallas Stars 12 seconds into the first period – a Minnesota Wild record. Later the same night, fellow rookie teammate Mathew Dumba notched his first. Fontaine scored three goals on January 9, 2014, against the Phoenix Coyotes for his first career NHL Hat Trick.\nIn his rookie season, Fontaine notched 13 goals, a good secondary scoring player for the Wild, although his 13 goals were impressive, Fontaine was sometimes a healthy scratch in favor of veteran players, when he did play however, he was mostly used as third or fourth liner. Fontaine finished his rookie season with 13 goals and 8 assists for 21 points. On July 29, 2014, Fontaine was re-signed to a 2-year contract. Fontaine played 9 playoff games, adding a goal and an assist against Colorado and Chicago.\nFontaine's playing time increased in his sophomore season, as he was constantly juggled from line to line. His role changes however, did not affect his play, as he was able to adapt rather quickly to playing on different lines and with different players. He was sometimes used as first or second liner when injuries came upon the Wild, and was credited for not changing his game when he was shuffled around. Fontaine showed signs of his old scoring self, but showed some of his playmaking skills as well. Fontaine's goals decreased to just 8, but he did however, notch 22 assists.\nOn March 27, 2014 in a game against the Calgary Flames Fontaine took a huge hit from Joe Colborne , the hit was deemed dirty by Wild players and Fontaine, because he did not have the puck at the time. Fontaine was able to stay in the game however, and on his very next shift, Fontaine setup Thomas Vanek's 20th goal to tie the game at 1, en route to a 4–2 Wild win.\nAfter ending his 5-year association with the Minnesota Wild, as a free agent off-season, Fontaine was unable to attain an NHL contract. On September 8, 2016, he agreed to attend the Florida Panthers training camp on a professional try-out contract.\nOn October 16, 2016, Fontaine signed a 1-year, 2-way deal with the New York Rangers and was immediately assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. However, after collecting 30 points in 50 games with the Wolf Pack on March 1, 2017, Fontaine was traded by the Rangers to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Taylor Beck.\nAs a free agent from the Oilers following the completion of his contract, Fontaine opted to pursue a career abroad in agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Dinamo Minsk of the KHL on July 31, 2017."

They finished fourth in the 2014 Olympics.\nAs of the 2018 April IIHF World Ranking, Damkronorna were ranked sixth in the world.\nMen's leagues.\nSHL.\nThe SHL (Swedish Hockey League or \"Svenska hockeyligan\"), founded in 1975 as Elitserien, is the highest level of men's ice hockey in Sweden, the second-most attended (in average attendance) sports league in Sweden (after Allsvenskan), the third-most attended ice hockey league in Europe, and as of 2006 is the fourth-highest paid hockey league in the world.\nHockeyAllsvenskan.\nHockeyAllsvenskan is the second tier of men's ice hockey, and has by far the highest average attendance of second-tier ice hockey leagues in Europe.\nHockeyettan.\nIn Hockeyettan, teams do not compete nationally, but rather break into four divisions/groups organized geographically. These smaller divisions play half a season together, after which the more successful teams in the four divisions join two new groups, organized geographically into \"Allettan North\" and \"Allettan South\", and play the rest of the season in the new groups. Meanwhile, the teams in the four beginning groups that did not qualify for Allettan continue playing in the original groups, with the poorest performing teams being forced to defend their spots against the winning teams from Division 2 in the qualification tournament known as Kvalserien. The two Allettan winners battle for a direct spot in the Kvalserien for HockeyAllsvenskan in a series known as Hockeyettanfinalen. The teams ranked 2–9 in each Allettan group, the loser of Hockeyettanfinalen and the winners of the continuation groups qualify for a three-round playoff where the final three remaining teams qualify for the same Kvalserien. These four teams are joined by the two worst HockeyAllsvenskan teams to battle for two spots in the following HockeyAllsvenskan season.\nTiers 4–7.\nAll leagues in Swedish ice hockey after Hockeyettan are organized regionally. There is Hockeytvåan, the fourth tier. Most regions also have Hockeytrean. The eastern region also has Hockeyfyran. Stockholm also has a seventh division, Division 5, and has also briefly had an eighth, Division 6.\nWomen's leagues.\nThe highest women's ice hockey league is Swedish Women's Hockey League, which has eight teams. Lower leagues are Damettan and Damtvåan."

Moreno appeared in 73 games played in Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators from –. The native of Güines stood tall and weighed .\nCareer.\nAfter joining professional baseball, Moreno was a star hurler for the Havana Cubanos of the Class B Florida International League, winning 50 of 66 decisions (.758) from 1947 to 1950, before being called up by the Senators for the final month of the 1950 campaign.\nIn his Major League debut on September 8, he started against the Philadelphia Athletics and pitched a complete game, 10–4 victory at Griffith Stadium. Moreno spent the full and seasons with Washington, as both a starter and relief pitcher, and was credited with 12 complete games and two saves during that period. He made his last MLB start on May 25, 1953 — also against Philadelphia — and threw another complete game victory over the Athletics, 6–1. Although Moreno had compiled a 3–1 record that season and his best MLB earned run average (2.80), he was sent to the minor leagues in mid-season and spent the rest of his career in minor and winter league baseball. At age 45, he worked in 38 games for the 1966 Puebla Pericos in the Double-A Mexican League. Two years later, as batting practice pitcher for the world champion Detroit Tigers, he was voted a full World Series share by his teammates.\nAs a Major Leaguer, Moreno surrendered 349 hits and 157 bases on balls, and recorded 119 strikeouts, in 336⅔ innings pitched."

He best known for his college career at Santa Clara University, where he was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Year in 1972. He is the father of former NBA player Michael \"Yogi\" Stewart.\nCollege career.\nStewart, a 6'10\" tall center, played college basketball at the University of Santa Clara, from 1970 to 1973. After redshirting in what would have been his sophomore year, he was a three-year starter for the Broncos, and he led the team in scoring all three years. As a junior in the 1971–72 season, Stewart averaged 21.2 points and 9.7 rebounds per game. He also shot a 64.7% in field goal percentage. He was named the WCC Player of the Year, and he was also named an All-American, by the Helms Athletic Foundation. His strong college season led to him being one of 28 players that was given an invitation to Team USA's training camp trials for the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics. However, he did not make the USA's 12 man 1972 Summer Olympics team.\nSince Stewart had redshirted in college, he was eligible to be drafted professionally. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, in the 6th round of the 1972 NBA draft, with the 95th overall pick. He was also drafted by The Floridians of the American Basketball Association (ABA). However, he chose to return to Santa Clara for his final season of college eligibility. In his final college season, Stewart averaged 18.7 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. He was again named to the All-West Coast Conference First team. He was inducted into Santa Clara's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1987.\nProfessional career.\nIn the 1973 NBA draft, Stewart was selected in the 7th round, by the Boston Celtics, with the 120th overall pick of the draft. However, he never played in the NBA. He instead played briefly in the Western Basketball League, with the Martinez Muirs. Stewart then headed to France, where he played for seven years, with AS Merck and AS Monaco. He was a standout for those teams, and he was later named to AS Monaco Basket's club Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nMike Stewart is the father of Michael \"Yogi\" Stewart, who played several years in the NBA."

The club competes in USA Rugby South's third division.\nHistory.\nARFC was founded in 1973 by Jim \"Jim Rugby\" Macmillan and Danny Ferguson. Both ruggers had previously played rugby during their undergraduate college years. The pair were classmates at the Medical College of Georgia and started the team to serve as a much needed distraction for their fellow medical students. Thus, the MCG Mad Dogs were born -- \"Mad Dogs\" being derived from the abbreviation for \"Medical Doctor\" (MD).\nThe team has played on several fields over the years, converting football, soccer, softball and polo fields to passable rugby pitches. Ultimately, ARFC finalized an agreement with the city of Augusta, GA to lease unused property near downtown Augusta which led to the construction of Larry Bray Memorial Pitch, named after the late long-time \"old boy\" Larry Bray. The inaugural match was played on September 19, 2009, against Jacksonville Rugby with Augusta pulling out the win in the closing minutes of a very exciting match."

        "title": "C. J. Brown (American football)",
        "text": "Clark \"C. J.\" David Brown Jr. (born June 27, 1991) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at the University of Maryland and was the Terrapins starting quarterback in 2011, 2013 and 2014. In 2011, Brown broke the school's 61-year-old single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 162 yards against No. 8 Clemson.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born on June 27, 1991 in Troy, Michigan to Clark and Kimberley Brown, Sr., the eldest of their three children. His father attended Michigan State University, where he played as a quarterback on the football team. The family later relocated to Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, and Brown attended Seneca Valley Senior High School.\nAt Seneca Valley, Brown earned three letters on both the basketball and football teams. He said that basketball was his preferred sport, but felt that he had a brighter future on the gridiron. As a junior, he averaged 12.0 points per game in basketball, and according to the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" was athletic enough to execute a 360-degree dunk. Brown served two seasons as the football team captain, and ran Seneca Valley's spread offense. Brown set the school records with 3,845 passing yards and 26 touchdowns over the course of his interscholastic career, and also set the school single-season for passing yards in his senior season.\nAs a freshman, he played quarterback for the first time, and showed early promise before suffering a broken collarbone. As a sophomore in 2006, Brown rushed for 586 yards and five touchdowns. He was named an honorable mention All-Northern Six Conference player. As a junior in 2007, he passed for 1,567 yards and 11 ;touchdowns, and was the team's second leading rusher with 443 yards and five touchdowns. The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" named him to its \"Fab 22\". As a senior in 2008, he passed for 2,154 yards and 14 touchdowns and rushed for 680 yards and 12 touchdowns. The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" again selected him for its \"Fab 22\", and the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" named him to its \"Fantastic 25\". Brown twice selected unanimously as an All-Northern Six Conference player.\nRivals.com rated Brown a three-star prospect, and ranked him as the 17th-best dual-threat quarterback in the nation and 14th-best prospect in the state of Pennsylvania. Scout.com also rated him a three-star prospect, and ranked him the 67th best quarterback prospect in his class. Brown received scholarship offers from Maryland and Akron. Indiana, Michigan State, Northwestern, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Virginia, and West Virginia also showed interest in Brown. After Brown gave a verbal commitment to attend Maryland in April 2008, the Pittsburgh and Penn State coaching staffs said they would be interested if he reopened his recruitment.\nCollege career.\nBrown enrolled at the University of Maryland, and served a redshirt season in 2009. In 2010, he saw action in four plays against Morgan State. On his first snap, he gained 12 yards on an option run, and lowered his shoulder into two opposing tacklers. He suffered a broken collarbone on the run, but remained in the game for three more plays. The injury ended his season. During his convalescence, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, \"I just told him he has to hang in there, he has to sit in the meetings and learn as much as you can. That's an area where he was coming on. I still think he's got the potential to be a very, very good quarterback. He's very mobile and he has a strong arm and [he is] a smart guy. He's just further behind because of his high school development.\" During the season, fellow redshirt sophomore Danny O'Brien captured the starting position and finished with ACC Rookie of the Year honors. Friedgen was fired after the season and replaced by Connecticut head coach Randy Edsall, who selected Gary Crowton as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\nDuring the spring, Edsall said \"C. J. Brown is putting pressure on Danny [O'Brien]. C.J. Brown is playing very well. I think we're in a good situation.\" O'Brien entered the 2011 season as the established starter at quarterback, but the staff hoped to use Brown because of his mobility and athleticism. Brown recorded a 4.42-second 40-yard dash. Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey said, \"You watched today and you watched him outrunning linebackers. Before today, he outran a safety, which seems crazy. Crazy athletic. Both [quarterbacks] are definitely going to play.\" Against No. 12 Georgia Tech, O'Brien struggled, completing one pass on six attempts and throwing an interception. Brown came off the bench to relieve O'Brien, and while he also struggled passing, going 4-for-17 for 36 yards and an interception, he rushed for 124 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown off of a zone-option read. After the game, he said, \"I know the passing game in and out, just like I'm supposed to ... It might not have showed today, but I knew I was making the correct reads. Maybe the balls weren't there on time, and I was a little off ... I'll get better week to week.\" Maryland head coach Randy Edsall stated the starting quarterback for the following week's game against No. 8 Clemson would be a game-time decision. Brown started against Clemson, and played the duration of the 56–45 loss. He recorded 17 completions on 35 attempts for 177 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. He also rushed for a touchdown. Brown carried the ball 22 times for 162 yards, which set the single-game rushing yards record for a Maryland quarterback.\nThe record was previously held by Jack Scarbath, who rushed for 132 yards against Georgetown in 1950.\nBrown missed the 2012 season with an ACL injury. He returned to be the starting quarterback in the 2013 season. For the season he passed for 2,242 yards with 13 passing touchdowns and rushed for 576 yards with 12 rushing touchdowns. Brown remained the starter his senior season in 2014, passing for 2,288 yards and 13 touchdowns.\nStatistics.\nThrough the end of the 2014 regular season, Brown's statistics are as follows:"

The Titans, in their 1970s throwback uniforms, jumped to a quick 8–0 lead to force a Red Storm time out. St. John's rallied to tie the game at 15 and later had a one–point lead, but Detroit took advantage of the Red Storm's inability to score a point for over eight minutes, retaking the lead and leading by double–digits. The Titans went into half–time up 32–21. The Red Storm led a furious comeback to start the second half, going on a 9–0 run to bring the Titan lead down to just a single bucket, but a jump shot from Chase Simon followed by a fast–break by Doug Anderson helped regain the momentum.

Coming off a suspension of more than 10 games, Holman scored 21 points from the bench to lead all Titans in scoring and tied LaMarcus Lowe with the most rebounds, grabbing 3 offensive rebounds and 7 overall. The Titans started with a 9–0 run and never looked back. They led by as much as 24 points at several moments in the first half before going into half–time up 61–39. The Titans faltered in the second half at times, letting Western Michigan pull within 9 with 3:36 remaining in the game, but the Titans protected the lead with a few key baskets and free throws as they defeated the Broncos 92–81. The Titans kept their turnovers far lower than average, losing the ball 8 times while dishing out 18 assists. This was the first game of the season where the Titans had 10 active players, just in time to travel to Tuscaloosa to face the nationally ranked Alabama Crimson Tide.\n12/11/2011 – Detroit at #16/15 Alabama&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit faced off with its most difficult road opponent of the regular season, taking on the Alabama Crimson Tide, a then Top 20 nationally ranked team. The Titans struggled early, going 0–for–10 on field goals to start the game, and the Tide capitalized, surging to a 12–1 lead. The Titans had great difficulty scoring in the first half, going just 7–of–29 from the field and 0–of–7 from 3, leading to a likely insurmountable 38–22 deficit at half–time. Detroit made many attempts in the second half to mount runs and cut into Alabama's lead, but every time the Titans would cut the lead to 10 or 12, Alabama would surge ahead again and again, stretching their lead to as much as 18 at 57–39 with 5:13 remaining.

LaMarcus Lowe grabbed 10 rebounds in the effort, and Eli Holman scored 9 points and grabbed 9 boards in 27 minutes off the bench.\n12/17/2011 – Detroit vs #17/16 Mississippi State&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit played its second Top 20 nationally ranked SEC foe in a row, this time hosting the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Titans took an early 3–0 lead on a 3–pointer by Chase Simon. Mississippi State then went on a 15–4 run to go up 15–7. The Titans kept cutting into the lead, stopping every Bulldog attempt to pull away in the first half. Detroit fought back to tie the game three times, and went into half–time down three points at 39–36 Bulldogs. Mississippi State came out swinging in the second half, starting on a 10–0 run in the first 2:13 to extend their lead to 13 at 49–36. The Bulldogs would stretch their lead to 15 with 15:05 remaining in the game before the Titans mounted another run fueled by a dunk and tip–in from Eli Holman. PJ Boutte hit a layup and Chase Simon hit a 3–pointer to cut the Bulldog lead back down to 6. Mississippi State stretched the lead back to 11 with 7:26 remaining before the Titans mounted another comeback.

Holman contributed 12 points and a team high 9 rebounds off the bench in just 17 minutes of play.\n12/22/2011 – Detroit vs Alabama State&lt;br&gt;\nAfter dropping five of their last seven games, Detroit tried to get their season out of disarray, hosting the Alabama State Hornets of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The game did not start as the Titans had intended, trailing for the majority of the first half. Alabama State took an early five-point lead on a three-pointer by Ivory White six minutes into the game. The Hornets led by as much as six, keeping the Titans at bay for the majority of the first half before the Titans went on a 7–0 run to take the lead at 25–24. Detroit ended the half on a 10–4 run to take a 40–34 lead at half-time. Early in the second half up just 48–43, Eli Holman had a slam dunk and Doug Anderson followed it up with two more, permanently shifting the momentum in favor of the Titans. Detroit finished the remainder of the game on a 32–13 run to beat Alabama State 80–56. Anderson posted 16 points on 6–of–8 shooting and 12 rebounds and Ray McCallum added 19 points and 5 assists.\n12/29/2011 – Detroit at UIC&lt;br&gt;\nLooking for their first conference win, the Titans traveled to Chicago, Illinois to meet the UIC Flames. UIC jumped out to a 16–5 lead to start the game, but the Titans responded with a 9–0 run to bring Detroit within a single score. Eli Holman scored from under the rim to tie the game at 18–all, and Doug Anderson followed it up with a two-handed slam dunk to take the lead by two. Despite being up large early in the game, the Flames went into half-time with a narrow 30–28 lead. The Titans only shortly regained the lead with six minutes remaining in the game on a jumper in the paint by Chase Simon, but UIC retook the lead on a three-pointer by Gary Talton. The Titans were down 61–59 with 11.8 seconds remaining, and Jason Calliste, a 76% free-throw shooter, managed to draw a foul with 2.8 seconds left in the game. He went on to miss the front-end of a one–and–one, and Flames guard Daniel Barnes pulled down the rebound and hit two free throws to end the game in a 63–59 defeat for the Titans. Detroit fell to 0–3 in conference play and 7–10 overall.\n12/31/2011 – Detroit at Loyola Chicago&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing their loss to UIC two days prior, the Titans traveled across town to face Loyola Chicago. The Ramblers led for almost the entirety of the first half, stretching their lead as high as eight before the Titans mounted a comeback culminating in a successful three-point play by Doug Anderson to take the lead going into half-time 27–24. Detroit had an early 8–0 run in the second half to go up 34–26, and continued to hold Loyola at bay, stretching their lead into double digits multiple times. The Ramblers got as close as 44–39 at the 8:44 mark from a layup by Denzel Brito, but the Titans never let up, defeating Loyola 65–54 and gaining their first conference win of the season. Chase Simon led the team in scoring with 17, and Ray McCallum added 13 points, leading the Titans in rebounding (7) and assists (5).\n1/6/2012 – Detroit vs Valparaiso&lt;br&gt;\nThe Titans started the new calendar year with a bout at Calihan Hall against the Valparaiso Crusaders. Valpo ran out to an early eight-point lead to go up 12–4, but the Titans answered with a 16–1 run to go up 20–13. The Titans stretched their lead to double digits many times throughout the first half, but the Crusaders chipped away at the lead before going into half-time down just 3 at 35–32 Detroit. Valpo retook a small lead early in the second half, but the Titans kept battling back in the first four minutes, leading to three lead changes before the media timeout. After several more lead changes, the Crusaders took a six-point lead with 4:29 remaining. With the Titans down 67–63 with 2:33 to play, Chase Simon hit a three-pointer and Eli Holman hit a jumper after getting a blocked shot at the other end to take the lead 68–67 with 1:28 left. Ryan Brokehoff hit a jump shot to put Valparaiso back in front by 1, and Eli Holman countered by grabbing his own missed shot for an offensive rebound and hitting another big shot and successfully converted a three-point play to put the Titans back out in front 71–69 with 47 seconds left. The Crusaders' Jay Harris hit a layup to tie the game once again at 71–71, giving the Titans a chance to have the final shot with just 26 seconds remaining. With still 10 seconds left, Chase Simon started driving inside the lane to the hoop, knocking a Valpo player over and being called for an offensive foul for charging. With 5 seconds still left on the clock, Erik Buggs drove the length of the court and hit a layup at the buzzer to give Valparaiso the victory 73–71."

        "title": "Mattamy National Cycling Centre",
        "text": "The Mattamy National Cycling Centre is a track cycling facility in Milton, Ontario, Canada built for the 2015 Pan American Games. During the Pan Am and Parapan Am Games the venue was known as the \"Cisco Milton Pan Am / Parapan Am Velodrome\".\nDescription.\nThe velodrome is the first-ever UCI-regulated, class 1 indoor velodrome in Canada, and only the second in North America along with the VELO Sports Center in Los Angeles. It features a 250-metre timber track with two 42-degree angle banks. During the games the velodrome had 2,500 seats. After the games the velodrome became the home of Cycling Canada’s national track cycling program, with the seating being reduced to 1,500. The facility also includes community recreational space including a cardio and strength training fitness centre, group fitness studio, 300 metre walking/jogging track and three sport courts for volleyball, basketball, and badminton.\nFinancing &amp; Opposition.\nThe facility was originally scheduled to be built at Mohawk College in Hamilton, however the city withdrew after its city council voted to spend a maximum of only $5 million. In October 2011, Milton council was given six weeks by organizers to sign a binding agreement. \"We only have six weeks for binding agreement. That’s not enough time for public feedback and that makes me nervous,\" said Ward 8 Councillor Zeeshan Hamid. On January 31, 2012 Milton town council voted in favour of building the velodrome in their town.\nThe facility costed a total of $56 million to build (with $47.4 million to build/design the facility and the rest going to operation costs after the games have finished).\nMilton paid 44 percent of the cost to build the velodrome ($25 million), which will come from the town itself, the proposed Milton Education Village and private donations. The rest ($31 million) came from the Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games.\nAfter Montreal failed to sustain its track cycling venue from the 1976 Summer Olympics, some Milton residents and town councillors questioned the long-term viability of such a facility in Milton after the 2015 Pan Am Games. \"There’s a lot of suppositions,\" said Councillor Rick Malboeuf. \"This could happen, that could happen. The business plan doesn’t make sense.\" Malboeuf was convinced history will repeat itself in Milton. Communities such as Hamilton and Vaughan passed on the Pan Am velodrome, he pointed out. \"They had a good reason. It’s such a highly specialized sport. Where are the regular participants and events going to come from after the games are over? Just like the other venues like Montreal, this one will sit empty.\" As to his constituents, he said, \"Twenty to one, they’re against it. They want to know why we’re worried about a velodrome when we don’t even have a hospital. That’s what they want. But it’s going to get done. They have the votes. I’m still not going to vote for it.\"\nIn June 2013 Milton Mayor Gord Krantz said \"We are committed. Some of us may not like how this has evolved, but we are at least in my opinion, at the point of no return.\" He said, down the road, he hopes he can hold Malboeuf accountable to his words that he be the first to stand up and say he was wrong should the project turn out to be a success. \"I predict he will. He’s a man of his word and I believe he’ll say he’s wrong,\" said Krantz.\nAccording to Community Services Director Jennifer Reynolds, the initial $40 million price tag was expected to be covered by the following sources listed in a 2011 staff report: \nTotal: $39.6 million\nInitial construction costs were announced as being $40 million, but ballooned to $56 million before work began. \"I said back then it couldn’t be built for $40 million and I was told I was wrong and now we’re seeing the cost will be more like $56 million and a shovel hasn’t even hit the ground yet,\" said Malboeuf.\nThe breakdown evolved to:\nThe Town's portion of $3.6M has been re-directed from the budget for the Sherwood Community Centre which would have opened in 2015/2016. By legislation, recreation development funds are only available for use on recreational facilities (not roads, hospitals, or fire services).\nVelodrome facilities in Winnipeg for the 1967 (demolished) and 1999 (dismantled and re-located to Europe) Pan Am Games no longer exist.\nIn February 2013, it was revealed that early construction of roads and additional site costs had caused the total project cost to mushroom to $63 million.\nThe Milton velodrome's legacy funding for maintenance and operation of the facility has been referred to as \"smoke and mirrors\" by opponents. In June 2013 the legacy funding was announced as being $735,850 annually for 20 years commencing in 2014. The legacy grant amount will be revisited on an annual basis after the initial three years over the minimum 20-year life of the Legacy Fund. A 2016 Velodrome Operating Forecast released in 2013 showing anticipated revenues versus expenditures projected a net loss of $410,499.\nIncorporation Into Education Village.\nThe Town's plan to have the velodrome anchor the proposed future Wilfrid Laurier University in the Milton Education Village took a hit in May 2015 when the province rejected Laurier's pitch for the satellite campus on the site. The Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities says there will be a second call for proposals in spring 2016, for a campus in the Peel and Halton region — which includes Milton. Laurier's president said the school does intend to resubmit its proposal.\nOn October 26, 2016, Ontario announced it will build new university campuses in Milton and Brampton as part of a larger plan to improve access to education in underserved areas of the province. At the announcement in Milton, Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development Deb Matthews said the facilities will focus on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM).\nCommunity Usage.\nIn a September 2016 Town of Milton staff report, track cycling numbers at the local velodrome exceeded the Town's expectations, with waitlists for track time continuing to grow:\nIn 2016, the net operating cost per capita for the MNCC is sitting at $4.03 – the second lowest of the major Town facilities, with the Leisure Centre sitting at the bottom of the list at $2.95. The Milton Sports Centre is $5.48, Beaty Branch Library is $6.10 and the Milton Centre for the Arts leads the pack at $6.19 (excluding the library).\nWard 4 councillor Rick Malboeuf, said the legacy funding of $735,000 the Town receives from the provincial and federal governments to offset the operating costs of the velodrome aren't included in the aforementioned per capita cost breakdown. If they were, he estimated it would increase the per capita cost from $4.03 to around $12. But councillor Rick Di Lorenzo, who sits on the MNCC Management Committee, contended that since the legacy funds include federal dollars and are therefore paid by all Canadians, not just Miltonians, including those funds in the calculations would only increase the per capita cost by two cents."

        "text": "Salem-Independence was the name of a professional baseball team which was founded in May 1893 and folded in July of that year. The team was a member of the fleeting Oregon State League. Originally, the team was scheduled to play exclusively in Salem, Oregon, however, due to financial difficulties, the owner was forced to sell the team to a banker in Independence. On July 8, 1893, it was announced that the team was to return to Salem where they played the remainder of the season. Soon after, the team folded and withdrew from the league. However, it was later reported that the Salem team traveled to the San Francisco area to play amateur teams.\nEstablishment.\nWhen the Oregon State League was officially formed in May 1893, it was announced that a franchise would be established in Salem, Oregon, as well as Portland, Albany and Oregon City. The league held a convention for the league in Salem on May 11 where they revealed the official rules and by-laws. W. M. Hunt, of the Salem club, was named league president. On May 22, Salem withdrew from the league. H. Hershberg, a banker from Independence, Oregon agreed to back the team financially if they were relocated to Independence, which they were. Albert Collet was hired to be the team's manager.\nRegular season.\nThe team's roster at the being of the season was John McGreavy, pitcher; Fred Strand, shortstop and pitcher; Kurts Billings, catcher; Jack Cook, first baseman; J. McCarthy, left fielder; T. F. Thompson, center fielder; George Sharp, right fielder; and Albert Collet, second baseman. The first game of the season for Independence was played on June 3 against Oregon City. Independence, who was the home team, was victorious, 16–8. Most of Independence's players had just returned from training camp in California.\nOn July 8, it was announced that the Independence team would be transferred to Salem. The first games would talk place in that town on July 15 and 16 at the ball park near Oak Grove and The Oregon State Fair Grounds. The team management was transferred to Minto, of Salem. In their first game as Salem on July 9, the team beat Albany, 9–8. It was announced that Salem's first home game, which was to be played against Oregon City, would start at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 15. Admission to the game was set a twenty-five cents. Salem unveiled their new blue pants, white shirt uniform for their July 15 contest. Salem swept both games from Oregon City. Their first game was won by a score of 12–6. Their second game finished with a score of 16–9. It was announced on July 19 that the team was folding and would no longer be a member of the Oregon State League. However, shortly after that announcement, another report stated that the Salem club was going to travel to San Francisco to play against other teams."

        "text": "The Australian Capital Territory Ice Hockey Association, currently trading as Ice Hockey ACT is the governing body of ice hockey in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The Australian Capital Territory Ice Hockey Association is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nHistory.\n1980: Formation.\nThe Evening of 4 August 1980 was the date of a meeting held at the Hughes Community Center where it was decided that an Ice Hockey Association was to be established in the Australian Capital Territory and a steering committee was formed on this evening to establish the association. The meeting was attended by 30 people, several of which were members of the Australian Ice Hockey Federation including: John Purcell (AIHF President), AIHF secretary and AIHF Development officer. The committee was formed with 8 people, one of which was John Slater who was the person that organised the meeting and was also a former A-grade ice hockey player from Melbourne. The steering committees purpose was to organise coaching facilities and create a constitution for the new association that they proposed for the middle of September that year when the Phillip Ice Skating Centre was to be finished and opened to the public. The plan was to form 4 teams consisting of under 21 and pee wee players with the aim to concentrate on development rather than focus on competition.\nThe inaugural meeting to elect the first committee was held at Phillip Ice Rink on 28 January 1981 scheduled after registration for 6:00pm. The Association and players were divided into 4 districts – Belconnen, Canberra North, Canberra South and Woden.\nThe First Team.\nThe first ice hockey club established within the Australian Capital Territory Ice Hockey Association was the Polar Bears who competed in the 1981 season against a team formed by other players called Grizzly Bears, formed for the purpose of being able to have a team for the Polar Bears to compete against for exhibitions and competition matches. The association aimed to form 3 teams for the 1982 season representing Belconnen, Woden and Central. The Belconnen club would largely consist of the existing Polar Bears ice hockey club. The last game of the 1981 ice hockey in the ACT season was held at 4:30pm on 29 November 1981 and was between the Canberra Knights and the New South Wales premiership team Finn Eagles.\nPresident's Bicentennial Ice Hockey Championship.\nBetween 11 and 17 September 1988, a 4 team international championship was held at the Phillip Ice Rink where teams from Canada, United States of America and Australia would compete. Members of the Iowa State Cyclones and former National Hockey League Teen Ranch All Stars would partake in the championship against the Australian National team and the Canberra Knights. Former players from the Toronto Maple Leafs, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets would visit and help prepare the Australian National team for the IIHF Pool C Championship being held the following year in Sydney.\nBackground.\nThe Australian Capital Territory Ice Hockey Association (ACTIHA) was formed as the Australian Capital Territory's branch for Ice Hockey Australia. It is responsible for organising the nine territory leagues across the five different age groups. It is also responsible for selecting teams to compete in the national tournaments.\nThe ACTIHA also runs a hockey academy for beginners. It runs for seven sessions over two months and at the completion of the program players are filtered into an age and skill appropriate league. ACTIHA operates its leagues out of the Phillip Ice Rink."

        "text": "The 2011 Rugby World Cup Final was a rugby union match between France and New Zealand, to determine the winner of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The match took place on 23 October 2011 at Eden Park, in Auckland, New Zealand. New Zealand won the match 8–7, the smallest margin by which any Rugby World Cup final has been decided.\nNew Zealand were favourites, as they went into the final unbeaten and the French had lost two pool games, including one to New Zealand. The French team also experienced a player revolt against their coach Marc Lièvremont, confirmed after the tournament by veteran back-rower Imanol Harinordoquy. The match was a close-fought and tight contest with few line-breaks. Each side scored one try and the outcome was determined by kicks – the All Blacks kicked a penalty goal while the French managed only the conversion of their try. The result was the lowest score of any World Cup final.\nThe match echoed the 1987 Rugby World Cup Final which was also held at Eden Park between the same teams. As in the 2007 final, both teams had progressed from the same pool.\nNew Zealand's victory marked the first time that a nation had held both the men's World Cup and Women's Rugby World Cup, as the Black Ferns had won the 2010 tournament.\nMatch summary.\nChoice of colours.\nFrance won the toss for choice of colours ahead of the final at Eden Park, but agreed to play in their white change kit to allow New Zealand to play in their traditional all-black kit.\nHaka and French response.\nAfter the national anthems, the New Zealand players performed the Kapa o Pango haka as the French team stared back and then advanced towards them in a V-shaped formation before fanning out into a straight line. The French had decided to meet the haka in this fashion on Sunday morning, and French captain Thierry Dusautoir stated that \"it was a great moment\". They were later fined £2,500 by the IRB for crossing the half-way line, a decision that was labeled \"pedantic\" and the \"final insult\". \nFirst half.\nIn a match of \"grim physical attrition\", New Zealand scored first. From a line-out in the French 22, Tony Woodcock received the ball and broke through a hole in the French defence to score his first try of the World Cup. Piri Weepu, who had already missed a penalty kick, failed with his conversion effort. Weepu missed another attempt in the 25th minute. Nine minutes later, New Zealand's Aaron Cruden, the team's third choice fly-half, only playing due to injuries to Dan Carter and Colin Slade, hyper-extended his knee, and was replaced by Stephen Donald. The French were forced to defend stoically for much of the first half, due to New Zealand playing a good running game, but late in the half François Trinh-Duc missed a drop goal attempt and had a run to the line cut off by Weepu.\nSecond half.\nThe French came back into the game in the second half, although it did not begin well for them: Dimitri Yachvili missed the team's first penalty attempt after two minutes, and Stephen Donald pushed New Zealand further into the lead by successfully kicking a penalty two minutes later. The French reacted straight away: Trinh-Duc made a run towards the line, and after several attempts, Dusautoir scored a try, which Trinh-Duc converted to take the score to 8–7. Trinh-Duc attempted a penalty kick from 48 metres in the 65th minute, but missed the goal, and thereafter there were few chances for either side. The French captain, Dusautoir, who was described as \"enjoying a heroic game in defence\" by \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Brendan Gallagher, was named man of the match.\nAnother historic milestone occurred when Jean-Marc Doussain came on as a late substitute for France. He became the first player ever to make his Test debut in a Rugby World Cup Final.\nRefereeing controversy.\nCraig Joubert's refereeing was heavily criticised by the French team and many international observers. Greg Growden writing for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" accused Joubert of \"ignoring offside play and breakdown indiscretions that should have cost the home team penalties\". Hugh Farrelly interviewed in The \"Irish Independent\" stated laconically that \"France were significantly better over 80 minutes\" and \"Craig Joubert did not referee evenly\" and \"some of the decisions were disgraceful for a game of this magnitude\". On the other hand, former French referee Joël Jutge reviewed 24 instances of the game and concluded 17 times Joubert made the correct decisions, four incorrect decisions favoured the All Blacks and three incorrect decisions favoured the French.\nRichie McCaw and New Zealand coach Graham Henry pointed out that New Zealand had deliberately tried to play the game in a way that did not result in them conceding penalties, especially in the second half. After the game McCaw expressed surprise that Aurélien Rougerie was not cited by the IRB for gouging at his eyes and noted that the final became \"filthy\" as it went on but made no mention of Joubert or his performance.\nDramatisation.\nIn July 2013, it was announced that a made-for-TV movie, to be called \"The Kick\", would be made. The telemovie focused on Stephen Donald, and his successful penalty kick early in the second half that ultimately provided the winning points. Donald had been unwanted for the All Blacks squad prior to the final, due to some previous poor international performances. However, injuries to Carter, Slade (both earlier in the tournament), Cruden and Weepu led to the opportunity for a \"charming story of redemption\". David de Lautour was cast as Donald. The movie debuted on New Zealand television on 10 August 2014."

The series consisted of 4 continental championships (European, Pan American, Oceania and Asian), 3 world cup races and the world championships.\nFinal standings.\nThe winner of each world cup race was awarded 30 points. Semifinalists were guaranteed at least 5 points and paddlers eliminated in heats received 2 points each. The continental championships had a lesser status with the winner earning 20 points, semifinalists at least 2 points and all others were awarded 1 point for participation. Because the continental championships were not open to all countries, every athlete could only compete in one of them. The world championships points scale was the same as for the world cups multiplied by a factor of 1.5. That meant the world champion earned 45 points, semifinalists got at least 7.5 points and paddlers eliminated in heats received 3 points apiece.

        "title": "1993 Major League Baseball expansion",
        "text": "The 1993 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in Major League Baseball (MLB) adding two expansion teams to the National League (NL) for the 1993 season: the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins).\nBackground.\nTalks of expansion began on August 8, 1985, when the players and the owners agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The basic agreement allowed the National League to expand by two members to match the American League, which had done so in 1977. Details of expansion were finalized in the 1990 CBA.\nTen cities were considered serious candidates for the two spots: Buffalo, Charlotte, Denver, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, Phoenix, Sacramento, Tampa Bay, and Washington. The Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg and Pilot Field in Buffalo were built specifically to lure an existing or expansion MLB franchise.\nThe National League expansion committee consisted of Pittsburgh Pirates Chairman Doug Danfort, New York Mets president Fred Wilpon and Houston Astros owner John McMullen. On December 18, 1990, the committee eliminated Charlotte, Nashville, Phoenix and Sacramento from consideration to cut the list down to six finalists. With three sites from Florida remaining in contention it became apparent that one would win out while the other spot would go to a non-Florida team.\nDenver, Colorado.\nAfter previous failed attempts to bring Major League Baseball to the state of Colorado (most notably the Pittsburgh Pirates nearly relocating to Denver following the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985), by the late 1980s a team seemed to be a possibility in Denver. Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players Association, stated that he expected Denver would receive one of the expansion franchises.\nThe Colorado Baseball Commission, led by banking executive Larry Varnell, was successful in getting Denver voters to approve a 0.1% sales tax to help finance a new baseball stadium. Also, an advisory committee was formed in 1990 by then-Governor of Colorado Roy Romer to recruit an ownership group. The group selected was led by John Antonucci, an Ohio beverage distributor, and Michael I. Monus, the head of the Phar-Mor drugstore chain. Local and regional companies—such as Erie Lake, Hensel Phelps Construction, KOA Radio, and the \"Rocky Mountain News\"—rounded out the group. The Denver group chose to call their franchise the Colorado Rockies, the same name used as the National Hockey League franchise that played in Denver from 1976 to 1982. \nMiami, Florida.\nU.S. Senator Connie Mack III from Florida, the grandson of baseball great Connie Mack and a member of the Senate Task Force on Major League Baseball, pushed Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent to expand to Florida.\nOn March 7, 1990, Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, announced he had purchased 15 percent of the NFL's Miami Dolphins and 50 percent of the Dolphins' home, Joe Robbie Stadium, for an estimated $30 million. Huizenga stated his intention to aggressively pursue an expansion franchise. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park — the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. \nOn June 10, 1990, Huizenga was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League (NL) for a $95 million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 as the Florida Marlins. The Miami group chose to call themselves the \"Florida\" Marlins to broaden their fanbase to the entire state, while reviving the nickname \"Marlins\" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962–1970) and Miami Marlins (1982–1988) teams that played in the Florida State League.\nFinalization of expansion plans.\nIn June 1991, the expansion committee accepted the bids of the Miami and Denver groups to debut in 1993. Expansion was approved unanimously by all teams in July 1991. \nAn expansion draft to stock both franchises was set for November 1992. Though previous expansions allowed the drafting of players from the same league only, Vincent declared that the American League would receive $42 million of the National League's $190 million in expansion revenue so that the AL would provide players in the National League expansion draft. In an attempt to win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed that the AL owners were entitled to 22% of the $190 million take. This decision marked the first time in expansion history that leagues were required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league's expansion draft. Vincent said the owners expanded to raise money to pay their collusion debt.\nThe Tampa Bay Baseball Group sued MLB for allegedly reneging on an agreement to grant an expansion team to Tampa. The suit was settled in 2003, five years after Tampa's major league team, the Devil Rays (now simply the Rays), began play in the American League."

        "title": "Cycling infrastructure",
        "text": "Cycling infrastructure is all infrastructure cyclists are allowed to use. Bikeways include bike paths, bike lanes, cycle tracks, rail trails and, where permitted, sidewalks. Roads used by motorists are also cycling infrastructure, except where cyclists are barred such as many freeways/motorways. It includes amenities such as bike racks for parking, shelters, service centers and specialized traffic signs and signals. The more cycling infrastructure, the more people get about by bicycle.\nGood road design, road maintenance and traffic management can make cycling safer and more useful. Settlements with a dense network of interconnected streets tend to be places for getting around by bike. Their cycling networks can give people direct, fast, easy and convenient routes.\nHistory.\nThe history of cycling infrastructure starts from shortly after the bike boom of the 1880s when the first short stretches of dedicated bicycle infrastructure were built, through to the rise of the automobile from the mid-20th century onwards and the concomitant decline of cycling as a means of transport, to cycling's comeback from the 1970s onwards.\nBikeways.\nA bikeway is a lane, route, way or path which in some manner is specifically designed and /or designated for bicycle travel. Bike lanes demarcated by a painted marking are quite common in many cities. Cycle tracks demarcated by barriers, bollards or boulevards are quite common in some European countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. They are also increasingly common in major cities elsewhere, such as New York, Melbourne, Ottawa, Vancouver and San Francisco. Montreal and Davis, California, which have had segregated cycling facilities with barriers for several decades, are among the earliest examples in North America.\nVarious guides exist to define the different types of bikeway infrastructure, including UK Department for Transport manual \"The Geometric Design of Pedestrian, Cycle and Equestrian Routes\", Sustrans Design Manual, UK Department of Transport Local Transport Note 2/08: Cycle infrastructure design the Danish Road Authority guide \"Registration and classification of paths\", the Dutch \"CROW\", the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) \"Guide to Bikeway Facilities\", the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \"Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices\" (MUTCD), and the US National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) \"Urban Bikeway Design Guide\".\nIn the Netherlands, The \"Tekenen voor de fiets\" design manual recommends a width of at least 2 meters, or 2.5 metres if used by more than 150 bicycles per hour. A minimum width of 2 meters is specified by the cities of Utrecht and 's-Hertogenbosch for new cycle lanes. The Netherlands also has protected intersections to cyclists crossing roads. \nTerms.\nSome bikeways are separated from motor traffic by physical constraints (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards)—bicycle trail, cycle track—but others are partially separated only by painted markings—bike lane, buffered bike lane, and contraflow bike lane. Some share the roadway with motor vehicles—bicycle boulevard, sharrow, advisory bike lane—or shared with pedestrians—shared use paths and greenways.\nSegregation.\nThe term bikeway is largely used in North America to describe all routes that have been designed or updated to encourage more cycling or make cycling safer. In some jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, \"segregated cycling facility\" is sometimes preferred to describe cycling infrastructure which has varying degrees of separation from motorized traffic, or which has excluded pedestrian traffic in the case of exclusive bike paths.\nThere is no single usage of \"segregation\"; in some cases it can mean the exclusion of motor vehicles and in other cases the exclusion of pedestrians as well. Thus, it includes bike lanes with solid painted lines but not lanes with dotted lines and advisory bike lanes where motor vehicles are allowed to encroach on the lane. It includes cycle tracks as physically distinct from the roadway and sidewalk (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards). And it includes bike paths in their own right of way exclusive to cycling. Paths which are shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic are \"not\" considered segregated and are typically called shared use path, multi-use path in North America and shared-use footway in the UK.\nSafety.\nOn major roads, segregated cycle tracks lead to safety improvements compared with cycling in traffic. There are concerns over the safety of cycle tracks and lanes at junctions due to collisions between turning motorists and cyclists, particularly where cycle tracks are two-way. The safety of cycle tracks at junctions can be improved with designs such as cycle path deflection (between 2m and 5m) and protected intersections. At multi-lane roundabouts, safety for cyclists is compromised. The installation of separated cycle tracks has been shown to improve safety at roundabouts. A Cochrane review of published evidence found that there was limited evidence to conclude whether cycling infrastructure improves cyclist safety. \nLegislation.\nDifferent countries have different ways to legally define and enforce bikeways.\nBikeway controversies.\nSome detractors argue that one must be careful in interpreting the operation of dedicated or segregated bikeways/cycle facilities across different designs and contexts; what works for the Netherlands will not necessarily work elsewhere, or claiming that bikeways increase urban air pollution.\nOther transportation planners consider an incremental, piecemeal approach to bike infrastructure buildout ineffective and advocate for complete networks to be built in a single phase.\nProponents point out that cycling infrastructure including dedicated bike lanes has been implemented in many cities; when well-designed and well-implemented they are popular and safe, and they are effective at relieving both congestion and air pollution.\nBikeway selection.\nJurisdictions have guidelines around the selection of the right bikeway treatments in order make routes more comfortable and safer for cycling.\nA study reviewing the safety of \"road diets\" (motor traffic lane restrictions) for bike lanes found in summary that crash frequencies at road diets in the period after installation were 6% lower, road diets do not affect crash severity, or result in a significant change in crash types. This research was conducted by looking at areas scheduled for conversion before and after the road diet was performed. While also comparing similar areas that had not received any changes. It is noted that further research is recommended to confirm findings.\nBikeway types.\nBikeways can fall into these main categories: separated in-roadway bikeways such as bike lanes and buffered bike lanes; physically separated in-roadway bikeways such as cycle tracks; right-of-way paths such as bike paths and shared use paths; and shared in-roadway bikeways such as bike boulevards, shared lane markings, and advisory bike lanes. The exact categorization changes depending on the jurisdiction and organization, while many just list the types by their commonly used names\nSharing with motor traffic.\nCyclists are legally allowed to travel on many roadways in accordance with the rules of the road for drivers of vehicles. \nA bicycle boulevard or cycle street is a low speed street which has been optimized for bicycle traffic. Bicycle boulevards discourage cut-through motor vehicle traffic but allow local motor vehicle traffic. They are designed to give priority to cyclists as through-going traffic.\nA shared lane marking, also known as a sharrow is a street marking that indicates the preferred lateral position for cyclists (to avoid the door zone and other obstacles) where dedicated bike lanes are not available.\nA 2-1 road is a roadway striping configuration which provides for two-way motor vehicle and bicycle traffic using a central vehicular travel lane and \"advisory\" bike lanes on either side. The center lane is dedicated to, and shared by, motorists traveling in both directions. The center lane is narrower than two vehicular travel lanes and has no centerline; some are narrower than the width of a car. Cyclists are given preference in the bike lanes but motorists can encroach into the bike lanes to pass other motor vehicles after yielding to cyclists. Advisory bike lanes are normally installed on low volume streets. Advisory bike lanes have a number of names. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration calls them \"Advisory Shoulders\". In New Zealand, they are called 2-minus-1 roads. They are called Schutzstreifen (Germany), Suggestiestrook (Netherlands), and Suggestion Lanes (a literal English translation of Suggestiestrook).\nBicycle highways.\nDenmark and the Netherlands have pioneered the concept of \"bicycle superhighways\". The first Dutch route opened in 2004 between Breda and Etten-Leur; many others have been added since then. In 2017 several bicycle superhighways were opened in the Arnhem-Nijmegen region, with the RijnWaalpad as the best example of this new type of cycling infrastructure.\nThe first Danish route, C99, opened in 2012 between the Vesterbro rail station in Copenhagen and Albertslund, a western suburb. The route cost 13.4 million Danish kroner and is 17.5 km long, built with few stops and new paths away from traffic. \"Service stations\" with air pumps are located at regular intervals, and where the route must cross streets, handholds and running boards are provided so cyclists can wait without having to put their feet on the ground. Similar projects have since been built in Germany among other countries.\nThe cost of building a bicycle super highway depends on many things, but is usually between €300,000/km (for a wide dedicated cycle track) and €800,000/km (when complex civil engineering structures are needed).\nCycling-friendly streetscape modifications.\nThere are various measures cities and regions often take on the roadway to make it more cycling friendly and safer. Aspects of infrastructure may be viewed as either cyclist-hostile or as cyclist-friendly. However, scientific research indicates that different groups of cyclists show varying preferences of which aspects of cycling infrastructure are most relevant when choosing a specific cycling route over another. Measures to encourage cycling include traffic calming; traffic reduction; junction treatment; traffic control systems to recognize cyclists and give them priority; exempt cyclists from banned turns and access restrictions; implement contra-flow cycle lanes on one-way streets; implement on-street parking restrictions; provide advanced stop lines/bypasses for cyclists at traffic signals; marking wide curb/kerb lanes; and marking shared bus/cycle lanes.\nColombian city, Bogota converted some car lanes into bidirectional bike lanes during coronavirus pandemic, adding 84 km of new bike lanes; the government is intending to make these new bike lanes permanent. In the US, slow-street movements have been introduced by erecting makeshift barriers to slow traffic and allow bikers and walkers to safely share the road with motorists.\nTraffic reduction.\nRemoving traffic can be achieved by straightforward diversion or alternatively reduction. Diversion involves routing through-traffic away from roads used by high numbers of cyclists and pedestrians. Examples of diversion include the construction of arterial bypasses and ring roads around urban centers.\nIndirect methods involve reducing the infrastructural capacity dedicated to moving motorized vehicles. This can involve reducing the number of road lanes, closing bridges to certain vehicle types and creating vehicle restricted zones or environmental traffic cells. In the 1970s the Dutch city of Delft began restricting private car traffic from crossing the city center. Similarly, Groningen is divided into four zones that cannot be crossed by private motor-traffic, (private cars must use the ring road instead). Cyclists and other traffic can pass between the zones and cycling accounts for 50%+ of trips in Groningen (which reputedly has the third-highest proportion of cycle traffic of any city). The Swedish city of Gothenburg uses a similar system of traffic cells.\nAnother approach is to reduce the capacity to park cars. Starting in the 1970s, the city of Copenhagen, where now 36% of the trips are done by bicycle, adopted a policy of reducing available car parking capacity by several per cents per year. The city of Amsterdam, where around 40% of all trips are by bicycle, adopted similar parking reduction policies in the 80s and 90s.\nDirect traffic reduction methods can involve straightforward bans or more subtle methods like road pricing schemes or road diets. The London congestion charge reportedly resulted in a significant increase in cycle use within the affected area.\nTraffic calming.\nSpeed reduction has traditionally been attempted by statutory speed limits and enforcing the assured clear distance ahead rule.\nRecent implementations of shared space schemes have delivered significant traffic speed reductions. The reductions are sustainable, without the need for speed limits or speed limit enforcement. In Norrköping, Sweden, mean traffic speeds in 2006 dropped from 21 to 16 km/h (13 to 10 mph) since the implementation of such a scheme.\nEven without shared street implementation, creating 30 km/h zones (or 20 mph zone) has been shown to reduce crash rates and increase numbers of cyclists and pedestrians. Other studies have revealed that lower speeds reduce community severance caused by high speed roads. Research has shown that there is more neighborhood interaction and community cohesion when speeds are reduced to 20 mph.\nOne-way streets.\nGerman research indicates that making one-way streets two-way for cyclists results in a reduction in the total number of collisions. In Belgium, all one-way streets in 50 km/h zones are by default two-way for cyclists.\nA Danish road directorate states that in town centers it is important to be able to cycle in both directions in all streets, and that in certain circumstances, two-way cycle traffic can be accommodated in an otherwise one-way street.\nTwo-way cycling on one-way streets.\nOne-way street systems can be viewed as either a product of traffic management that focuses on trying to keep motorized vehicles moving regardless of the social and other impacts, such as by some cycling campaigners, or seen as a useful tool for traffic calming, and for eliminating rat runs, in the view of UK traffic planners.\nOne-way streets can disadvantage cyclists by increasing trip-length, delays and hazards associated with weaving maneuvers at junctions. In northern European countries such as the Netherlands, however, cyclists are frequently granted exemptions from one-way street restrictions, which improves cycling traffic flow while restricting motorized vehicles.\nGerman research indicates that making one-way streets two-way for cyclists results in a reduction in the total number of collisions.\nThere are often restrictions to what one-way streets are good candidates for allowing two-way cycling traffic. In Belgium road authorities in principle allow any one-way street in zones to be two-way for cyclists if the available lane is at least wide (area free from parking) and no specific local circumstances prevent it.\nDenmark, a country with high cycling levels, does not use one-way systems to improve traffic flow. Some commentators argue that the initial goal should be to dismantle large one-way street systems as a traffic calming/traffic reduction measure, followed by the provision of two-way cyclist access on any one-way streets that remain.\nIntersection and junction design.\nIn general, junction designs that favor higher-speed turning, weaving and merging movements by motorists tend to be hostile for cyclists. Free-flowing arrangements can be hazardous for cyclists and should be avoided. Features such as large entry curvature, slip-roads and high flow roundabouts are associated with increased risk of car–cyclist collisions. Cycling advocates argue for modifications and alternative junction types that resolve these issues such as reducing kerb radii on street corners, eliminating slip roads and replacing large roundabouts with signalized intersections.\nProtected intersection.\nAnother approach which the Netherlands innovated is called in North America a protected intersection that reconfigures intersections to reduce risk to cyclists as they cross or turn. Some American cities are starting to pilot protected intersections.\nBike box.\nA bike box or an advanced stop line is a designated area at the head of a traffic lane at a signalized intersection that provides bicyclists with a safer and more visible way to get ahead of queuing traffic during the red signal phase.\nRoundabouts.\nOn large roundabouts of the design typically used in the UK and Ireland, cyclists have an injury accident rate that is 14–16 times that of motorists. Research indicates that excessive sightlines at uncontrolled intersections compound these effects. In the UK, a survey of over 8,000 highly experienced and mainly adult male Cyclists Touring Club members found that 28% avoided roundabouts on their regular journey if at all possible. The Dutch CROW guidelines recommend roundabouts only for intersections with motorized traffic up to 1500 per hour. To accommodate greater volumes of traffic, they recommend traffic light intersections or grade separation for cyclists. Examples of grade separation for cyclists include tunnels, or more spectacularly, raised \"floating\" roundabouts for cyclists.\nTraffic signals/Traffic control systems.\nHow traffic signals are designed and implemented directly impacts cyclists. For instance, poorly adjusted vehicle detector systems, used to trigger signal changes, may not correctly detect cyclists. This can leave cyclists in the position of having to \"run\" red lights if no motorized vehicle arrives to trigger a signal change. Some cities use urban adaptive traffic control systems (UTCs), which use linked traffic signals to manage traffic in response to changes in demand. There is an argument that using a UTC system merely to provide for increased capacity for motor traffic will simply drive growth in such traffic. However, there are more direct negative impacts. For instance, where signals are arranged to provide motor traffic with so-called green waves, this can create \"red waves\" for other road users such as cyclists and public transport services. Traffic managers in Copenhagen have now turned this approach on its head and are linking cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane to provide green waves for rush hour cycle-traffic. However, this would still not resolve the problem of red-waves for slow (old and young) and fast (above average fitness) cyclists. Cycling-specific measures that can be applied at traffic signals include the use of advanced stop lines and/or bypasses. In some cases cyclists might be given a free-turn or a signal bypass if turning into a road on the nearside.\nSignposting.\nIn many places worldwide special signposts for bicycles are used to indicate directions and distances to destinations for cyclists. Apart from signposting in and between urban areas, mountain pass cycling milestones have become an important service for bicycle tourists. They provide cyclists with information about their current position with regard to the summit of the mountain pass.\nNumbered-node cycle networks are increasingly used in Europe to give flexible, low-cost signage.\nWidening outside lanes.\nOne method for reducing potential friction between cyclists and motorized vehicles is to provide \"wide kerb\", or \"nearside\", lanes (UK terminology) or \"wide outside through lane\" (U.S. terminology). These extra-wide lanes increase the probability that motorists pass cyclists at a safe distance without having to change lanes. This is held to be particularly important on routes with a high proportion of wide vehicles such as buses or heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). They also provide more room for cyclists to filter past queues of cars in congested conditions and to safely overtake each other. Due to the tendency of all vehicle users to stay in the center of their lane, it would be necessary to sub-divide the cycle lane with a broken white line to facilitate safe overtaking. Overtaking is indispensable for cyclists, as speeds are not dependent on the legal speed limit, but on the rider's capability.\nThe use of such lanes is specifically endorsed by \"Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities\", the European Commission policy document on cycle promotion.\nShared space.\nShared space schemes extend this principle further by removing the reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing all road users to use any part of the road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the partial conversion of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%). However, in July 2018, the UK 'paused' all further shared space schemes over fears that a scheme dependent on eye-contact between drivers and pedestrians was unavoidably dangerous to pedestrians with visual impairments.\n\"CFI\" argues for a marked lane width of . On undivided roads, width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing HGVs while being narrow enough to deter drivers from \"doubling up\" to form two lanes. This \"doubling up\" effect may be related to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided. The European Commission specifically endorses wide lanes in its policy document on cycling promotion, \"Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities\".\nShared bus and cycle lanes.\nShared bus and cycle lanes are also a method for providing a more comfortable and safer space for cyclists. Depending on the width of the lane, the speeds and number of buses, and other local factors, the safety and popularity of this arrangement vary.\nIn the Netherlands mixed bus/cycle lanes are uncommon. According to the Sustainable Safety guidelines they would violate the principle of homogeneity and put road users of very different masses and speed behavior into the same lane, which is generally discouraged.\nRoad surface.\nBicycle tires being narrow, road surface is more important than for other transport, for both comfort and safety. The type and placement of storm drains, manholes, surface markings, and the general road surface quality should all be taken into account by a bicycle transportation engineer. Drain grates, for example, must not catch wheels.\nTrip-end facilities.\nBicycle parking/storage arrangements.\nAs secure and convenient bicycle parking is a key factor in influencing a person's decision to cycle, decent parking infrastructure must be provided to encourage the uptake of cycling. Decent bicycle parking involves weather-proof infrastructure such as lockers, stands, staffed or unstaffed bicycle parks, as well as bike parking facilities within workplaces to facilitate bicycle commuting. It also will help if certain legal arrangements are put into place to enable legitimate \"ad hoc\" parking, for example to allow people to lock their bicycles to railings, signs and other street furniture when individual proper bike stands are unavailable.\nOther trip end facilities.\nSome people need to wear special clothes such as business suits or uniforms in their daily work. In some cases the nature of the cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.\nTheft reduction measures.\nThe theft of bicycles is one of the major problems that slow the development of urban cycling. Bicycle theft discourages regular cyclists from buying new bicycles, as well as putting off people who might want to invest in a bicycle.\nSeveral measures can help reduce bicycle theft:\nCertain European countries apply such measures with success, such as the Netherlands or certain German cities using registration and recovery. Since mid-2004, France has instituted a system of registration, in some places allowing stolen bicycles to be put on file in partnership with the urban cyclists' associations. This approach has reputedly increased the stolen bicycle recovery rate to more than 40%. By comparison, before the commencement of registration, the recovery rate in France was about 2%.\nIn some areas of the United Kingdom, bicycles fitted with location tracking devices are left poorly secured in theft hot-spots. When the bike is stolen, the police can locate it and arrest the thieves. This sometimes leads to the dismantling of organized bicycle theft rings, as bike theft generally enjoys a very low priority with the police.\nBicycle lift.\nBicycle lifts are used to haul bikes up stairs and steep hills. They are used to improve accessibility and encourage casual cycling.\nBike escalators are widely used in East Asia and are used in parts of Europe.\nImpact.\nAccording to a 2019 study, protected and separated bike infrastructure is associated with greater safety outcomes for all road users.\nA 2021 review of existing research found that closing car lanes and replacing them with bike lanes or pedestrian lanes had positive or non-significant economic effects.\nA 2021 case-control study of cities found that redistributing street space for cycling infrastructure—for so-called \"pop-up bike lanes\" during the COVID-19 pandemic—lead to large additional increases in cycling. These may have substantial environmental and health benefits which contemporary decision-makers have pledged to genuinely strive for with set goals such as CO2 emissions reductions of 55% by 2030 by the EU, climate change mitigation responsibilities of the Paris Agreement and EU air quality rules.\nIntegration with public transit.\nCycling is often integrated with other transport. For example, in the Netherlands and Denmark a large number of train journeys may start by bicycle. In 1991, 44% of Dutch train travelers went to their local station by bicycle and 14% used a bicycle at their destinations. The key ingredients for this are claimed to be:\nIt has been argued in relation to this aspect of Dutch or Danish policy that ongoing investment in rail services is vital to maintaining their levels of cycle use.\nCycling and public transport are well integrated in Japan. Starting in 1978, Japan expanded bicycle parking supply at railway stations from 598,000 spaces in 1977 to 2,382,000 spaces in 1987. As of 1987, Japanese provisions included 516 multi-story garages for bicycle parking.\nIn January 2007, the European parliament adopted a motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles. In some cities, bicycles may also be carried on local trains, trams and buses so that they may be used at either end of the trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in Düsseldorf permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day. In Munich bicycles are allowed on the S-Bahn commuter trains outside of rush hours, and folding bikes are allowed on city busses. In Copenhagen, you can take your bicycle with you in the S-tog commuter trains, all times a day with no additional costs. In France, the prestigious TGV high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles. There have also been schemes, such as in Victoria, British Columbia, Acadia, and Canberra, Australia, to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted bike carriers.\nIn some Canadian cities, including Edmonton, Alberta, and Toronto, Ontario, busses on most city routes have externally mounted carriers for bicycles, and bikes are allowed on the light rail trains at no extra cost outside of rush hour. All public transit buses in Chicago and suburbs allow up to two bikes at all times. The same is true of Grand River Transit buses in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Trains allow bikes with some restrictions. Where such services are not available, some cyclists get around this restriction by removing their pedals and loosening their handlebars as to fit into a box or by using folding bikes that can be brought onto the train or bus like a piece of luggage. The article on buses in Christchurch, New Zealand, lists 27 routes with bike racks.\nHowever, there are strong cultural variations in how cycling is treated in such situations. For instance in the Irish university city of Galway, the same town that suggested cyclists dismount and walk across each intersection, the secure parking of bikes is forbidden within the grounds of the central train station. However, cut-price car parking is available for motorists holding a valid train ticket.\nBikesharing systems.\nA bicycle sharing system, public bicycle system, or bike share scheme, is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a very short-term basis. Bike share schemes allow people to borrow a bike from point \"A\" and return it at point \"B\". Many of the bicycle sharing systems are on a subscription basis.\nSee also.\nOrganizing bodies:\nMuli-modal road safety:"

        "title": "UEFA European Championship qualifying",
        "text": "The UEFA European Championship qualifying, branded as the European Qualifiers, is the process that UEFA-affiliated national football teams go through in order to qualify for the UEFA European Championship.\nIn this article, the years represent the final tournaments of the European Championship, and are not meant to correspond to the actual dates when the qualification matches were played.\nFormat evolution.\nResume.\nThe 1960 and 1964 qualifications were knock-out tournaments. The four quarter-final-winning teams qualified for the final stages, and one of them was chosen to host the competition.\nFrom 1968 onwards, a group stage began to be used as the main, or sole, component of qualification. In 1968, 1972 and 1976, the winners of the eight groups advanced to a quarter-final stage, which was still part of the qualifying. The four quarter-final winners progressed to the finals. Again, the host nation was selected among the four finalists.\nFrom 1980, the hosting rights would be assigned in advance, and the host teams would be guaranteed automatic qualification. The format of the finals was expanded to feature 8 teams. Winners of qualifying groups now proceeded to the finals directly. The 1980, 1984, 1988 and 1992 qualifications included seven groups, the winners of which would join the hosts in the finals, although in 1992 one winner was eventually banned from appearing and was replaced by the runner-up of its group.\nFrom 1996, a 16-team format was employed for the main tournament. Runners-up in qualifying groups now could also gain access to the finals. Play-off pairings were introduced as a second opportunity for teams that narrowly miss out direct qualification. The 1996 qualifying consisted of eight groups; the group winners as well as the six best runners-up qualified, and so did the winner of the play-off between the remaining two runners-up, joining the host country.\nIn 2000, the first-placed teams in the nine qualifying groups as well as the best runner-up progressed directly to the finals, while another four spots were taken by winners of play-offs contested by the remaining runners-up. For the first time there were two host countries; they both received automatic berths in the finals.\nIn 2004, along with the host team, the ten qualifying group winners advanced, as did the winners of the five play-off ties formed by the runners-up.\nIn 2008, the top two teams from each of the seven qualifying groups joined the two host teams to bring the number of finalists to 16. No play-off stage was held.\nThe 2012 qualification replicated the format of that of 2000: places were taken by nine group winners and the best runner-up, while the other runners-up determined four more finalists via play-offs, with the two host countries qualifying by default.\nStarting from 2016, the finals format was expanded again, now featuring 24 teams. It became possible for third-placed teams in qualifying groups to get to the Euros too. The 2016 qualifying included nine groups; the winners, the runners-up, and the best third-placed team advanced directly, while play-offs played by the other third-placed teams determined the last four finalists. The host nation still qualified automatically. The 2016 qualification tournament was the first one to be branded as the European Qualifiers, a trademark used from that point on for both the European Championship qualifications and the FIFA World Cup qualification tournaments in Europe.\nFrom 2020, qualification began to be linked with the newly created UEFA Nations League: participation in the qualifying play-offs was now determined based on the teams' performances in that competition and not in qualification itself. The play-offs themselves were restructured into four-team brackets consisting of semi-finals and a final. In the 2020 qualifying, the top two teams of the ten qualifying groups took twenty places in the main tournament. From each of the four divisions of the 2018–19 Nations League, the four best-ranked teams not already qualified for Euro 2020 filled in a play-off bracket for that division, and the winner of each bracket got a spot in the Euros too. There were no automatic berths for Euro 2020 as it was hosted by multiple cities across the continent. It was actually postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but retained its original branding.\nIn a similar fashion, the 2024 qualifying granted spots to the winners and runners-up of the ten qualifying groups, while this time only the top three divisions of the 2022–23 Nations League formed play-off brackets to determine three more finalists, and the host country got an automatic spot.\nFor 2028, the number of groups will be increased to twelve. The winners will advance to the finals, while the runners-up will either also advance directly or participate in play-offs. It is to be announced how many and which of the five host countries will qualify by default or will play qualification matches.\nParticipating teams.\nAll national teams that are members of UEFA are eligible to enter the qualification for the European Championship. A total of 56 distinct entities have made attempts to qualify for the European Championship. Of those, 55 are still active in the competition. Due to political changes, a few of the entities have appeared under multiple incarnations (see the footnotes to the below table), and the East Germany team is now defunct.\nSaarland, a former UEFA member, merged into West Germany in 1957 and therefore did not enter the qualifiers of any European Championships.\nOverview.\nKey\nTeam records.\nThe below table compares the overall records of all teams that have participated in qualification. Teams are ordered by points using the three points for a win system, then by goal difference, and then by goals scored. Note that this order does not represent any official rankings, and qualification tournaments are not direct competitions between all teams.\nThe \"Qualifying attempts\" column only counts qualifying campaigns where the team played at least one match, while the \"Appearances in the finals\" also include automatic qualifiers.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws.\nNotes on the table:\nTeams highlighted in bold participated in the 2024 qualifying. The table is updated to the matches played in March 2024."

        "text": "\"Anyone for Tennis (The Savage Seven Theme)\" is a song by the British rock band Cream. It was used as the theme song for the 1968 film \"The Savage Seven\". \nHistory and overview.\nGuitarist Eric Clapton wrote the song for the 1968 film \"The Savage Seven\". It was his second collaboration with lyricist Martin Sharp (their first was \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\"). According to biographer Michael Schumacher, Clapton was unable to find a melody that suited him, despite expending considerable time.\nThe song was recorded during the sessions for Cream's third album, \"Wheels of Fire\". However, it was released on \"The Savage Seven\" soundtrack album and as a single instead. Backed with \"Pressed Rat and Warthog\", it reached number 64 on the American \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in May 1968 and number 40 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1968.\n\"Billboard\" described the single as an \"unusual piece of folk-rock material with a clever dance arrangement.\" \"Record World\" said that \"Cream tell an intriguing fable in these grooves\" and that its rhythms \"have the sell sound.\" \"Cash Box\" said that \"surrealistic pictures are flashed one-after-another in a kaleidoscopic vision of today’s problems\" and that the song \"has a shock and near-protest appeal.\"\nCream mimed the song during their promotional appearance on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in May 1968 with a video middle section in which the band carry tennis rackets.\n\"Anyone for Tennis\" is included on several Cream compilation albums, including \"Superstarshine Vol. 6 / Cream\" (1972), \"\" (1983), \"The Very Best of Cream\" (1995), and the boxed set \"Those Were the Days\" (1997). It is also included in the Clapton boxed set \"Crossroads\" (1988).\nThe stereo recording of this song is encoded with the Haeco-CSG system. It has also been included as a bonus track on some CD releases of Wheels of Fire or Goodbye."

        "text": "The 2012 Scottish Challenge Cup final, also known as the Ramsdens Cup final for sponsorship reasons, was an association football match between Falkirk and Hamilton Academical on 1 April 2012 at Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It was the 21st final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nBoth teams progressed through four knock-out rounds to reach the final. The match was Falkirk's fourth appearance in the Scottish Challenge Cup Final with the club defending an unbeaten record in the final having won on three previous occasions, the most recent in 2004. It was also Hamilton's fourth appearance, the club winning twice in successive years in the early-1990s and losing in 2005. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League with both clubs from the First Division. The match was watched by 5,210 spectators as well as being broadcast live on BBC Alba.\nAn early goal from Darren Dods in the 2nd minute was enough for Falkirk to win the match 1–0. In doing so Falkirk became the first club to win the tournament for a fourth time.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition is a knock-out tournament and in 2011–12 was contested by 32 teams: the 30 clubs that played in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League and two Highland Football League clubs by invitation. For the first round only, the draw was divided into two geographical regions made up of 16 clubs – north/east and south/west. Teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated.\nFalkirk.\nFalkirk were placed in the north/east region for the first round and were drawn against Second Division side Brechin City away from home. All of the goals came in the first half but Darren Dods's debut goal in the 33rd minute proved to be the decider in the 2–1 win at Glebe Park. In the second round Falkirk faced fellow First Division side Dundee at the Falkirk Stadium. The only goal of the game came from Moroccan, Farid El Alagui in the 43rd minute and was enough to send Falkirk through to the quarter-final stage.\nThe reward for reaching the quarter-final stage was an away game against East Fife of the Second Division. The Methil based club took the lead on the 27th minute courtesy of a right-foot curler from Ryan Wallace. However, two goals in quick succession from Kallum Higginbotham and Craig Sibbald to make the score 3–1 was enough to overcome East Fife, with Higginbotham sealing the scoreline at 4–1 on the 87th minute in the match at Bayview Stadium.\nThe semi-final draw paired Falkirk with high flying Annan Athletic of the Third Division. Annan Athletic had played 12 games and won 10 in all competitions leading up to the semi-final tie and had knocked out First Division club Ayr United in the previous round. However, three first half goals, one from Mark Millar and two from Farid El Alagui saw off Annan Athletic in front of a record official attendance of 1,575 at Galabank.\nHamilton Academical.\nHamilton Academical competed in the south/west region for the first round and faced Third Division side Queen's Park at Hampden Park. Two debutant senior goals from Ali Crawford and David Hopkirk in the 72nd and 80th minutes respectively ensured a 2–0 victory for Accies and a clean sheet to progress to the second round. The opponents drawn were Partick Thistle of the First Division. A late penalty goal from Irishman James Chambers in the 86th minute at New Douglas Park was enough to book a place in the quarter-final stage.\nThe quarter-final draw paired Hamilton Academical with another First Division side, Greenock Morton, whom Accies defeated in the 1992 final. Despite Greenock Morton taking the lead in the 10th minute from a Paul Di Giacomo goal, Hamilton scored two other first half goals from Greig Spence and Simon Mensing to win 2–1 at New Douglas Park to progress to the semi-final stage.\nA third club from the First Division provided the opposition for Hamilton in the semi-final in the form of Livingston. A late first half goal in the 43rd minute from Mark McLaughlin was enough to knock out the West Lothian side in front of a crowd of 1,418 and progress to their fourth Scottish Challenge Cup final in the club's history.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe 2012 final marked the first time the event was hosted at Almondvale Stadium in Livingston, the home of Livingston F.C. The venue opened in 1995 and at the time of the final was officially known as the \"Braidwood Motor Company Stadium\" after its sponsor. Seating arrangements for spectators in the stadium were segregated with Falkirk supporters occupying the East Stand and parts of the North and South Stands whilst Hamilton fans were allocated tickets for the West (Main) Stand. Falkirk travelled around to the venue and Hamilton Academical travelled approximately .\nAnalysis.\nWith the inclusion of two Highland League clubs for the first time, this brought the number of teams competing up to 32 which meant that there was no random bye for any club into the second round so both Falkirk and Hamilton entered the first round. Falkirk eliminated three lower league clubs en route to the final whilst Hamilton eliminated only one; defeating three First Division teams before the final.\nBoth teams appeared in the final for the fourth time. Falkirk had won the tournament on their three previous final appearances in 1993, 1997 and 2004, whereas Hamilton Academical had won the tournament twice in successive years in 1991 and 1992 and came runner-up in 2005."

Ash led the Tigers to a 5–6 record in his senior year with 38 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. He also set multiple school records, including most career passing yardage, completions, and touchdowns. After his senior year, Ash was named the all-state second team quarterback and all-state first team punter.\nCollege career.\n2011 season.\nAsh committed to the Texas Longhorns on February 13, 2010, becoming the fourth player to commit to the football team during the 2010 recruiting class. Headed into the first game of the 2011 season against Rice, Ash was placed as a third-string quarterback on Texas' depth chart, alongside redshirt freshman Connor Wood and behind Case McCoy and Garrett Gilbert, respectively. In the season opener, Ash threw his first pass as a Texas Longhorns player for two yards. In the next game against the BYU Cougars, Ash remained as a backup quarterback, but was put into action after Garrett Gilbert was benched in the second quarter after throwing two interceptions. Ash threw for 35 yards against BYU while rotating at the quarterback position alongside Case McCoy. Ash and McCoy continued into their next game against UCLA as co-starters at the quarterback position, although McCoy would end up seeing more playing time. Ash threw his first touchdown in his collegiate career in the next game against Iowa State on a 48-yard pass to Mike Davis. Ash scored two touchdowns in a 37–14 victory against the Cyclones. In the annual Red River Rivalry against Oklahoma, Ash threw another touchdown but also threw two interceptions. Texas lost, 17–55, their worst loss against the Sooners since 2003. Because of McCoy's uneven performance in that game, Ash was named the starter for the next five games, during which the team went 2–3, and Ash was twice replaced by McCoy. After McCoy nearly sparked a comeback against Kansas State, Ash lost the starting job to him against Texas A&amp;M and Baylor. But a poor performance in the Baylor game, combined with good practices by Ash, led to another change at quarterback and Ash started in the Holiday Bowl against California. In that game he completed 14 of 23 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown while also catching a 4-yard touchdown pass from Jaxon Shipley, and was named the game's offensive MVP.\n2012 season.\nDuring the 2012 Texas spring game, Ash began the game with the Horns team to start the game and flipped between the Horns and Texas team throughout the scrimmage. However, Ash only threw seven passes, of which six were completed for 87 yards, including one touchdown. Ash also ran for only six yards on five attempts. The Texas team won the scrimmage 35–28. After the spring game and throughout the offseason, it was undecided whether Case McCoy or Ash would be the Longhorns' starting quarterback, with both appearing in preseason drills. However, on August 22, 2012, Ash was finally named the starting quarterback for Texas over McCoy.\nAsh made his first start of the 2012 season against Wyoming on September 1. In the season opener, Ash completed 74.1% of his passes for 156 passing yards. Ash's single touchdown came on a 16-yard strike to wide receiver Jaxon Shipley. The quarterback also ran three times for eight yards, helping the team to a 37–17 victory to begin the 2012 season.\nAgainst New Mexico, Ash once again threw no interceptions and completed a 72.7% completion percentage. Ash also threw for two touchdowns, including a 45-yard shovel pass to Daje Johnson in the third quarter, and a personal best of 221 yards. Through the first 10 games, Ash led Texas to 8 wins, including gutsy road wins against #22 Oklahoma State and #20 Texas Tech. In the Oklahoma State game, he led Texas on back-to-back 75 yard drives in the last ten minutes of the game for the win. In a losing effort against TCU he injured his ribs and kept playing, but then was forced to sit out the next week against Kansas State. He led the Horns to an 8–4 regular season which was good for third place in the Big 12 and an appearance in the 2012 Valero Alamo Bowl against Oregon State. Ash threw for 2 touchdowns and rushed for another as the Horns won the Alamo Bowl 31–27 to finish the season ranked #18.\n2013 season.\nAsh's 2013 season got off to a quick start against New Mexico as Ash threw for 343 yards and 4 touchdowns, and also ran 91 yards and a touchdown as #15 Texas defeated New Mexico State 56–7. However, in the next game Ash threw for 251 yards and 2 touchdowns before suffering a concussion late in the 4th quarter against a BYU team that would ultimately upset the Longhorns 40–21. After missing the 3rd game of the year against Ole Miss, Ash returned to game action and threw for 166 yards and 1 touchdown in the first half against Kansas State before re-aggravating his concussion in the 31–21 victory. Ash's concussion turned out to be more severe the 2nd time around as Ash was unable to return to the Longhorns for the remainder of the 2013 season.\n2014 season.\nAsh was given a medical hardship for the 2013 season, meaning that he entered 2014 with two years of remaining eligibility. At the end of spring training, he suffered a Jones fracture in his foot, an injury that required surgery.\nIn the first game of the 2014 season, Ash threw for 190 yards and a touchdown as Texas beat North Texas by a score of 38–7. He played almost the entire game and reported no concussion symptoms during it, but later that evening, he reported experiencing headaches and dizziness and was brought in for further evaluation. Ash reported believing that the first hit in that game triggered a recurrence of the symptoms that caused him to miss most of the 2013 season. As a result, Tyrone Swoopes was named the starter for the next game against BYU. On September 17, 2014, Ash announced that he would be walking away from football due to multiple concussions in his career.\nProfessional career.\nIn 2017, Ash unretired from football and was medically cleared to play. Per his agent, vestibular migraines were giving off concussion symptoms and have been controlled by medication. He took part in Texas's 2017 Pro Day. He then participated in The Spring League as an opportunity to gain experience among other young professionals and veterans of the NFL, and to create game film by participating in games for the instructional league during its debut year of operation. Among his highlights was a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenzel Doe. Following his performance during The Spring League, Ash was invited to the Carolina Panthers rookie mini-camp in May 2017, but was not signed to a contract. Ash played for The Spring League again in July as part of the Showcase game, where he started the game for the California roster and led several scoring drives. He completed 9-of-13 passes for 96 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Dixon and rushed three times for a total of 10 yards, with his longest for 9 yards. However, Ash's California roster lost to the East roster, 23–19. \nEurope.\nOn April 23, 2021, David Ash signed with the Warsaw Mets of the Polish Football League. The team went 3–5 and lost in the first round of the playoffs.\nPersonal life.\nAsh is the son of Stephen and Lynn Ash and one of six children. His father, Stephen was a principal at Academy Middle School in Little River, Texas. Ash is also a devout Christian and participates in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Young Life. He completed undergraduate study to obtain Bachelor of Science in Communications, then furthered his study to confer the Master of Science in Finance from The University of Texas at Austin."

Davis is the widow of longtime Raiders' owner Al Davis, and inherited the team upon her husband's death on October 8, 2011.\nAl Davis suggested in 1997 that Carol would succeed him should he no longer be able to run the Raiders franchise. He repeated this in 2006, and when asked in 2007 who would succeed him, Al Davis again confirmed his intention that Carol would take his place, claiming that then general manager Ron Wolf was \"very close to Carol.\"\nPersonal life.\nDavis grew up in New York City, and graduated from New York University with a marketing degree. She worked as a buyer, selecting designer clothing for retail stores, before her husband joined the Raiders. Carol and Al Davis married in a Brooklyn synagogue in 1954 after Al's discharge from the U.S. Army; the couple established a first home in Atlantic Beach, near Al Davis's parents.\nIn late 1979, Davis suffered a serious heart attack which placed her in the hospital and in a coma for three weeks, but later recovered completely.\nDavis has one son, Mark (born 1955). After her husband's death in October 2011, Raiders chief executive Amy Trask said that the team \"will remain in the Davis family.\" Carol and Mark hold controlling interest in the Raiders. However, Carol mostly leaves the Raiders in the hands of Mark, who took over his father's old post of managing general partner and operating head of the franchise. Davis still attends some games and was present for the groundbreaking of Allegiant Stadium in 2017. On September 21, 2020, Davis lit the Al Davis memorial torch prior to the Raiders first ever game at Allegiant Stadium. In 2021, she presented Tom Flores for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2011",
        "text": "The 2011 season saw Somerset County Cricket Club competing in three domestic competitions; the first division of the County Championship in which despite being within a shout of winning the Championship with two games to go a lack of consistency cost them and they finished 4th, and reached the finals of both one day domestic competitions the Clydesdale Bank 40 and the Friends Life t20. While in international competitions they failed to make it past the group stage in the Caribbean Twenty20 but impressed in the Champions League Twenty20 reaching the semi-finals.\nThey were captained for the second season by former England international, Marcus Trescothick, who topped the batting table scoring over 2,500 runs saw him named as both Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year.\nBackground.\nThe 2010 season yet again saw Somerset fall short in all domestic competitions finishing runners-up in each including finishing on equal points with champions Nottinghamshire in the County Championship and losing the Twenty20 competition on losing more wickets than champions Hampshire.\nSomerset started the season as many people's favourites for the County Championship title, and many praised the signings of Gemaal Hussain, Steve Kirby, Ajantha Mendis and George Dockrell. Both Hussain and Kirby signed from Gloucestershire to replace the loss of Ben Phillips to Nottinghamshire, Mark Turner to Derbyshire and Zander de Bruyn to Surrey with Michael Munday, Robin Lett and David Stiff were all released. While Mendis was brought in to cover while Murali Kartik and Alfonso Thomas are playing in the IPL both for Pune Warriors India and Kieron Pollard was brought in for the Friends Life t20 again with Roelof van der Merwe in addition for the first half of the competition while Pollard was on international duty with the West Indies. As well as these new players Alex Barrow, Calum Haggett and Craig Meschede were promoted from the club's academy and all featured in the first team as well as other débutants Adam Dibble and Lewis Gregory.\nSquad.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first-class, List A or Twenty20 cricket in 2011. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (14 April 2011).\nCaribbean Twenty20.\nBy finishing as runners-up in the 2010 Friends Provident t20, Somerset should have qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 but no English county sides were allowed to take part due to a clash with the end of the domestic season. So both winners Hampshire and Somerset were invited to compete in the 2010–11 Caribbean Twenty20 in January 2011.\nSomerset named a relatively strong side with a mixture of youth and experience but without captain Marcus Trescothick and wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter so the side were captained by Alfonso Thomas and these missing players provided a chance for Somerset débuts for George Dockrell, Calum Haggett, Gemaal Hussain, Steve Kirby and Craig Meschede. Somerset lost their first match against Guyana, who elected to bat first but with only two batsmen scoring double figures, Somerset strangled them to just 112/8 from their 20 overs with Alfonso Thomas taking 3-23 but after cruising to 105/3 off 18 overs Somerset looked to be in total control but then collapsed to lose 7 wickets for just 6 runs and therefore lost by a single run. Their second match against the Windward Islands was more successful with an allround bowling beformance coasting to a 17 run victory, Somerset scored 139/4 with Jos Buttler top scoring with 47 and the Windward Islands finished on 122/9 with Max Waller taking 3–16. In contrast in the next game, a contest reduced to 6 overs a side due to rain Jamaica scored 85 at 14.16 an over with only Waller taking a wicket and in reply Somerset scored just 24, losing by a whopping 61 runs. In their final game with no realistic chance of qualification Somerset scored 165/4 with James Hildreth top scoring with 69 aided by Nick Compton's 44 and an 11 ball 26 from Craig Meschede and in reply Combined Campuses and Colleges were restricted to 123/7 with Steve Kirby taking 3-26.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, T = Ties, L = Losses, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nCounty Championship.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, D = Draws, T = Ties, A = Abandonments, Bat = Batting points, Bwl = Bowling points, Adj = Adjustments/Penalties, Pts = Points.\"\nClydesdale Bank 40.\nThe 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40 saw Somerset finish as runners-up to Surrey in the Lord's final for the second year in succession. Somerset qualified for the semi-finals by topping their qualification group and securing a home semi against Durham, Somerset bowled their opponents out for just 219 and they strolled to 165 for 3 when bad weather ended the match with Somerset 39 runs ahead using Duckworth-Lewis. In the final after electing to bat, only Jos Buttler impressed with an impressive 86 dragging Somerset to a below par total of 214 all out, and after a few rain breaks Surrey required 186 from 30 overs and reached that total with 15 balls and 5 wickets to spare.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nFriends Life t20.\nIn the 2011 Friends Life t20 saw Somerset finish as runners-up to Leicestershire, reaching the final for the third year in succession. Somerset qualified for the knockout stage having finished fourth in their southern qualification group, to meet Nottinghamshire in the quarter-finals who they beat by five wickets to qualify for finals day. The semi-final against Hampshire was a rematch of the 2010 final and after a tied match decided using Duckworth-Lewis, Somerset won courtesy of a Super Over and reached the final against Leicestershire but despite restricting Leicestershire to 145 but the star studded batting line-up failed with only Peter Trego making 35 as Somerset lost for the third year running by 18 runs.\nThe season started with a rerun of the 2010 final with a match against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl, but despite a half-century from Peter Trego Somerset lost heavily by 7 wickets and although Somerset recovered with comprehensive victories over Kent and Middlesex bad weather hampered any chance of getting a run of home victories with only three out of seven matches completed at the County Ground. After a defeat away at Sussex, Marcus Trescothick scored a century in a massive 143 run victory away at Essex in one of his two man of the match performances. In Somerset's away victory at Glamorgan occasional spinner Arul Suppiah took new world record Twenty20 bowling figures of 6 for 5 in just 3.4 overs. A lack of consistency harmed Somerset's chance of a home quarter-final with the final game against Middlesex typifying their indifferent bowling where despite Middlesex needing to score 18 off the final over, Somerset failed to win and so finished fourth in the South Division.\nSomerset were drawn away at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire in the quarter-finals, Notts won the toss and elected to bat and scored an impressive total of 170 with Alex Hales top scoring with 78, Somerset started their innings slowly and it seemed they wouldn't get anywhere near their target and needed 64 off the final 31 deliveries but with Kieron Pollard and Jos Buttler at the crease they crossed the line with five balls remaining. That victory meant a third successive finals day and a rematch with Hampshire yet again and with bad weather looming Somerset won the toss and elected to field first hoping to take advantage of batting second with the Duckworth–Lewis method. Expensive bowling from the spinners and Pollard, Hampshire reached 138 off 15.5 overs propelled by 80 off just 41 balls from Shahid Afridi, with rain ending their innings one ball early Somerset were set a challenging 95 to win off just 10 overs and despite a cameo from Buttler Somerset fell one run short and required a Super Over to decide the match. Somerset sent in Kieswetter and Buttler for their over and scored 16 off Afridi's over and Alfonso Thomas restricted Hampshire to just 5–1 in their one over. In the final against Leicestershire, Somerset restricted them to 145 for 6, and despite no team ever having defended a lower total in an English Twenty20 final none of Somerset's batsman made a large score and they lost by 18 runs.\nWest Indies star Kieron Pollard returned as an overseas player but missed the first half of the Twenty20 campaign and was replaced by South African all-rounder Roelof van der Merwe.\nSeason standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, NR = No result, Adj = Adjustments/Penalties, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nChampions League Twenty20.\nBy finishing as runners-up in the Friends Life t20, Somerset qualified to compete in the 2011 Champions League Twenty20, for the second time. Somerset faced squad problems in the buildup to the tournament with Marcus Trescothick no longer travelling overseas due to health reasons, Kieron Pollard choosing his IPL franchise Mumbai Indians over Somerset and both wicket-keepers Jos Buttler and Craig Kieswetter missing due to international commitments for the first two matches.\nQualifier stage standings.\n\"Note: Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate.\"\nTourist match.\nIndia rested a number of their Test players for their first match of their tour; Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar and Harbhajan Singh were all left out of the team. The weakened bowling attack showed on the first day of the match, when Somerset scored 329 for the loss of two wickets from a rain-reduced 75 overs. Andrew Strauss, the England Test captain and Middlesex player, opened the innings as a guest batsman for Somerset, showed aggression initially, scoring 78 runs out of an opening partnership of 101, before getting out. Andrew McGlashan, summarising the day for ESPNcricinfo, described his innings as \"commanding\", and his shots \"in good working order\". After Strauss' dismissal, his opening partner Arul Suppiah began to score more freely, and reached his century off 179 balls, scoring his second 50 from just 57 deliveries. Suppiah and Nick Compton put on a second wicket partnership of 223 before Compton was dismissed for 88. Suppiah reached 156, his highest first-class score before he was out, and Somerset eventually declared their innings closed at 425/3.\nIn reply, the Indians struggled with the bat during the second, rain affected day; Somerset's Charl Willoughby took five wickets against a batting line-up which showed its lack of match practice and Craig Meschede took the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar for his first first-class wicket. On the third morning, Suresh Raina controlled the strike well to bat his way to a century and stake his claim for a place in first Test, dominating a final wicket partnership of 84. Somerset once more look assured with the bat during their second innings, in which Strauss reached a century, eventually finishing 109 not out, and Peter Trego scored a rapid 85 runs from 57 balls. Somerset declared at tea on the final day, leaving India only a short period to bat in the second innings. The match finished as a draw, but Somerset coach Andrew Hurry suggested that Somerset had \"bullied\" India, and that it had been \"a perfect three days\" for Strauss."

        "text": "Herbert Sutcliffe made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in the 1919 season, during which he and Percy Holmes developed one of county cricket's greatest opening partnerships. After initial success, Sutcliffe had a couple of relatively lean seasons before fulfilling his promise in 1922. In 1924, he made his debut for England in Test cricket and formed a famous Test opening partnership with Jack Hobbs. He enjoyed personal success on the 1924–25 MCC tour of Australia, although England lost the Test series 4–1 to Australia. In the 1926 Ashes series against Australia, Hobbs and Sutcliffe produced a series-winning partnership at The Oval in difficult batting conditions. By the end of the 1927 season, Sutcliffe was one of the world's premier cricketers and was being considered, although he was a professional, for the captaincy of Yorkshire.\n1919: debut season.\nSutcliffe joined Yorkshire at the age of 17 in 1912 and had represented the club's 2nd XI but the First World War delayed the start of his first-class career. He was 24 when his chance finally came. In May 1919, he played for the county's 2nd XI against a full-strength 1st XI and did very well, scoring 51 not out. He received a good report in the \"Yorkshire Post\" and never played for the 2nd XI again.\nYorkshire's first County Championship fixture after the war took place on 26 and 27 May at Bristol against Gloucestershire and Sutcliffe, batting at number 6, made his first-class debut. 1919 was the season when two-day games were tried in the championship but were soon perceived to be a failure. Yorkshire batted first, after losing the toss, and Sutcliffe made 11 in a total of 277 (Roy Kilner 112). Despite that seemingly modest score, Yorkshire won by an innings and 63 runs as Gloucestershire were bowled out twice for 125 and 89.\nSutcliffe's next match was his first at Lord's when Yorkshire played MCC in a 3-day match from 29 to 31 May. He did well in the 1st innings, scoring 38 in a total of only 120 but made just 3 in the 2nd innings. The match was drawn. Sutcliffe followed this with his first half-century when he made 67 not out against Cambridge University at Fenner's in a drawn two-day match on 2 and 3 June.\nAfter a drawn game against Essex at Leyton, Yorkshire went to Old Trafford for the first post-war Roses Match against Lancashire, Sutcliffe's first appearance in the fixture. Yorkshire were outplayed and lost by 140 runs but Sutcliffe earned a lot of plaudits with a defiant 2nd innings score of 53 in an all-out total of 153.\nSutcliffe continued to make progress, notably with a new highest score of 71 against Derbyshire, but he was still batting in the middle order. Veteran Wilfred Rhodes was still opening the innings for Yorkshire alongside Percy Holmes, who had played a few pre-war matches. Finally, in the match against Nottinghamshire at Bramall Lane on 27 and 28 June, Rhodes decided to drop down the order for the 2nd innings and Sutcliffe went in first with Holmes.\nSutcliffe had a run of indifferent scores after he began to open the innings but finally everything fell into place when Yorkshire played Northamptonshire on 23 and 24 July at Northampton. Yorkshire won the toss and then won the match by an innings and 196 runs. Sutcliffe and Holmes put on 279 for the first wicket with Sutcliffe scoring 145 and Holmes 133. In both cases, it was their highest score to date and Sutcliffe more than doubled his, hitting 21 fours and 1 six in the process.\nHaving scored his maiden century, Sutcliffe immediately made another in the return match against Gloucestershire. But he really came of age and made the grade when he scored 132 against Lancashire at Bramall Lane on 4 and 5 August, sharing another big partnership with Holmes of 253. Holmes made 123. However, the match was drawn.\nHolmes and Sutcliffe were both awarded their county caps in August 1919. Sutcliffe created a debut season record by scoring 1,839 runs at an average of 44.85 with 5 centuries and a highest score of 174 against Kent at Crabble Athletic Ground in Dover. Holmes did equally well by scoring 1,886 runs at an average of 43.86 with 5 centuries and a highest score of 140. Holmes and Sutcliffe scored 5 centuries each in 1919 and they shared in 5 century partnerships. Their performances were key to Yorkshire winning the championship that season for the 10th time in all.\nYorkshire had been hit by a double tragedy in recent years with the deaths of Alonzo Drake (illness) and Major Booth (killed in action during the war) and a rebuilding process was necessary. The success of Holmes and Sutcliffe went a long way towards completing that process. Otherwise, Yorkshire relied mainly on their Edwardian veterans George Herbert Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, David Denton and wicket-keeper Arthur Dolphin. As always in the era of Lord Hawke, now club president, the team captain was an amateur player and from 1919 to 1921 it was Cecil Burton who filled the role. Other mainstays of the team that Sutcliffe joined were pace bowler Abe Waddington, all-rounder Roy Kilner and seam bowler Emmott Robinson. But it was not a settled team and Yorkshire used a total of 21 players in the 1919 County Championship.\nAs a result of their success in 1919, Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe were both awarded a Wisden Cricketer of the Year title in 1920. In the accompanying review, \"Wisden\" commented on Sutcliffe's pre-war development and the benefits that both he and Holmes derived from Doughty's coaching. Sutcliffe's \"fine driving\" was commended but it was noted that \"he may not yet be quite so strong in defence\".\n1920 English cricket season.\nMiddlesex won the championship in both 1920 and 1921, while Yorkshire finished 4th and 3rd respectively. By his 1919 standards, Sutcliffe personally had two quieter years also.\nIn the 1920 season, he was well down the national averages with 1,393 runs at 33.16 with 4 centuries and a highest score of 131. Holmes in comparison had an outstanding season, scoring 2,254 runs at 50.08 with 7 centuries and a highest score of 302 not out. Holmes and Sutcliffe both made their highest score in August at the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth against Hampshire when they shared 347 for the first wicket, Yorkshire winning by an innings and 235 runs.\nYorkshire's transition continued and 1920 saw the debuts of future Test players George Macaulay and Maurice Leyland. George Hirst played fewer matches than in 1919 as he began to fade from the scene. Meanwhile, Norman Kilner, brother of Roy, became a first team regular.\n1921 English cricket season.\nIn 1921, Sutcliffe did not score a century and made 1,235 runs at 30.12 while Holmes, who was picked for England this year, made 1,577 runs at 38.46.\nYorkshire could be well satisfied with their third-place finish in the County Championship as the team was still in transition. The retirement of David Denton brought Edgar Oldroyd fully into the picture and Arthur Dolphin played less matches than previously as Reg Allen became the favoured wicket-keeper for a time. Norman Kilner ceased to be a regular and eventually joined Warwickshire. Macaulay, Sutcliffe's future business partner, was now the first choice opening bowler. Sutcliffe was one of six Yorkshire batsmen who scored 1,000 runs in the championship.\n1922 English cricket season.\nIn 1922, as Yorkshire regained the championship title under new captain Geoffrey Wilson, Sutcliffe lived up to his early promise by scoring 2,020 runs at 46.97 with a highest score of 232 against Surrey at The Oval. He scored 11 half-centuries but only 2 centuries.\nSutcliffe's performance against Surrey was the highlight of his career to date. He passed his previous highest score of 174, made in 1919, and he proved beyond doubt his ability to be the mainstay of an innings as Yorkshire made 539 for 5 declared and he shared in two century partnerships with Oldroyd and Roy Kilner. The match was eventually drawn.\nYorkshire by now did have a settled side and used only 16 players in the County Championship. Sutcliffe was one of seven players who were ever-present, playing in all 30 matches. The others were Holmes, Roy Kilner, Oldroyd, Rhodes, Robinson and Waddington. Macaulay missed only one match and Dolphin two. Leyland continued his development, making 12 appearances, and Arthur Mitchell made his debut.\n1923 English cricket season.\nSutcliffe's career advanced in 1923 when he made his first appearances in the North v South and Gentlemen v Players fixtures and in a Test Trial match. He scored 53 and 0 for the North in a match at Old Trafford which the South won by 38 runs. Making his debut for the Players at Lord's, he scored 3 and 78 not out in a drawn match in which he and Jack Hobbs opened together for the second time. In the Test Trial, playing for England v The Rest, Sutcliffe again opened with Hobbs and they put on 86 and 10 in their two partnerships, Sutcliffe scoring 65 and 7 as England won by 5 wickets.\nSutcliffe's overall record in 1923 was 2,220 runs at 41.11 with 3 centuries, 15 fifties and a highest score of 139 against Somerset. Holmes also topped 2,000 runs in the season and shared in 9 century stands with Sutcliffe, taking their overall tally to 25 and beating the record of 19 set by John Tunnicliffe and Jack Brown from 1895 to 1903. The Yorkshire cricket historian Alfred Pullin wrote: \"it was recognised long before the season ended that Sutcliffe had established his claim to be considered one of England's first-wicket batsmen\".\nYorkshire won the County Championship for the second successive season but in emphatic style as they won 25 out of 32 matches, 10 wins more than anyone else, and 13 of the victories were by an innings. Six batsmen (Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Kilner, Oldroyd and Rhodes) scored more than 1,000 runs in the championship. Macaulay, Kilner and Rhodes took over 100 wickets and Robinson took 95.\n1924 English cricket season.\nIn the 1924 season, Yorkshire completed a hat-trick of championships under Geoffrey Wilson and Sutcliffe enjoyed probably his best season to date, scoring 2,142 runs at 48.68 with 6 centuries including a highest score of 255 not out against Essex.\nHerbert Sutcliffe made his Test debut on Saturday, 14 June 1924, playing for England against South Africa at Edgbaston and opening the innings with Jack Hobbs. In this First Test, which England won by an innings, they recorded their first century partnership for England by putting on 136 before Sutcliffe was out for 64. \"Wisden\" said of his debut:\n\"Sutcliffe's first appearance in a Test match was nothing less than a triumph. Bowled by a yorker just after luncheon, he played flawless cricket, being especially strong on the leg side.\"\nIn the Second Test at Lord's, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored 268 before Sutcliffe was out for 122; Hobbs went on to make 211 and England again won by an innings. In the whole series, Sutcliffe scored 303 runs at 75.75.\nYorkshire faced a strong challenge from Middlesex for the County Championship and it was only because of two Middlesex defeats in the last fortnight of the season that they were able to take the title in the end. Apart from representative calls, Yorkshire fielded almost the same eleven players throughout the season: Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Kilner, Rhodes, Robinson, Wilson, Macaulay, Dolphin, Waddington.\n1924–25 MCC tour of Australia.\nAs early as July, Sutcliffe was one of ten players named who would tour Australia in the winter of 1924–25 under the leadership of Arthur Gilligan. The fee for this tour was £400 plus bonuses awarded on merit and additional expenses allowed of £1 10s per week on the sea voyages and £2 per week in Australia. Hobbs, however, declined the invitation because he was reluctant to leave his family and his sports goods business for several months. But, after approaches were made to entice him onto a short private tour of South Africa, with his wife also invited, it became apparent that Hobbs might be willing to go to Australia if his wife could accompany him. This was duly arranged, although Hobbs typically insisted on going as an \"extra team member\" so that none of those already selected would lose their place. The importance of this to Sutcliffe was that his partnership with Hobbs could continue at the very highest level of cricket where the presence of Hobbs was ultimately the key factor in Sutcliffe's major success on the tour, which established him as a world-class player.\nWhen Sutcliffe arrived in Australia he had some initial difficulty in adjusting to the conditions, specifically the strong light which affected his timing. He also reckoned that the pitches were a good four yards faster than in England. His remedy was to play straight and by hitting the ball back down the pitch. He said later that he sacrificed many of his best shots, but \"it paid off in the end\". He had certainly adjusted in time for the First Test against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground, a \"timeless\" match played from 19 to 27 December. Australia's main bowlers in the series were Jack Gregory, Charles Kelleway and Arthur Mailey, while Clarrie Grimmett made his Test debut in the final match. Hobbs and Sutcliffe twice made century partnerships in the First Test, which Australia won by 193 runs, with stands of 157 and 110. Sutcliffe's own scores were 59 and 115.\nIn the Second Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared 283 in the first innings and Sutcliffe scored two centuries in the match with 176 and 127. He was the first player to score hundreds in both innings against Australia, but he was unable to prevent Australia winning by 81 runs. The stand of 283 was in response to a massive Australian total of 600 and it drew enormous praise with Monty Noble, for example, describing it as \"English cricket at its best\". Noble pointed out that a huge mental as well as physical effort was needed to overcome the hopelessness of the England task. Sutcliffe rated it as the second best partnership of his career, beaten only by the \"sticky wicket\" stand at The Oval in 1926.\nAfter England lost by just 11 runs in an exciting Third Test at Adelaide Oval (Sutcliffe 33 and 59), they finally defeated Australia in the Fourth Test at Melbourne for the first time since 1912. Sutcliffe made 143, his 4th century of the series, after sharing in yet another century stand with Hobbs. England won by an innings and 29 runs. In the final Test at Sydney, England were completely undone by Grimmett who took 11 wickets on debut. Sutcliffe scored 22 and 0, Hobbs scored 0 and 13; England lost by 307 runs.\nAlthough England lost the series 4–1, they were much closer to Australia than they had been since the war and had recorded their first post-war victory in Tests against Australia. The series was a personal triumph for Sutcliffe who was given a civic reception on his return home to Pudsey. He scored 734 runs in the five Tests at an average of 81.55 with 4 centuries, 2 half-centuries and a highest score of 176. In the whole tour, he scored 1,250 runs at 69.44 with 5 centuries and a highest score of 188. Patsy Hendren was the only other England batsman to score over 1,000 runs on the tour.\n1925 English cricket season.\nHolmes and Sutcliffe scored over 4,700 runs between them in 1925 as Yorkshire won a 4th successive championship in what remains the last season, excluding wartime, in which no touring team came to England. Sutcliffe's tally was 2,308 runs at 53.67 with 7 centuries and a highest score of 235 against Middlesex at Headingley.\nDuring 1925 and 1926, Sutcliffe's skill was a primary factor in Yorkshire having the longest unbeaten run in county cricket: i.e., 70 matches without loss until early 1927. After three defeats in 1927, Yorkshire went a further 58 games without loss until 1929.\nFollowing the retirement of Geoffrey Wilson after the 1924 season, Yorkshire appointed yet another amateur as captain, this time Major Arthur Lupton who held the post from 1925 through 1927. Otherwise the team was unchanged apart from representative calls and Yorkshire generally sent out Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Kilner, Rhodes, Robinson, Lupton, Macaulay, Dolphin and Waddington in 1925. Arthur Mitchell was still a reserve and Cyril Turner made his first-class debut.\n1926 English cricket season.\nThe first four Tests of the 1926 England v Australia series were scheduled for just three days and were all curtailed by poor weather. The final Test at The Oval was timeless to ensure a finish. It has become one of the most famous matches in cricket history, not because England regained The Ashes for the first time since 1912 but for the manner it which it was achieved as Hobbs and Sutcliffe produced their most famous partnership in treacherous batting conditions. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22 and, at close of play on the second day (a Monday), Hobbs and Sutcliffe had taken the England second innings score to 49–0, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight and next day, as the sun shone, the pitch soon developed into a \"sticky wicket\" on which it was generally assumed that England would be bowled out cheaply and so lose both the match and the series. But, in spite of the very difficult batting conditions, Hobbs and Sutcliffe put up a great defence of their wickets and gradually increased their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and, in the end, England won the game comfortably, by 289 runs, and regained The Ashes.\nThe pitch was described by match umpire Frank Chester as \"the worst sticky wicket I have ever seen\". The problem facing the batsmen on the rapidly drying pitch was that the ball did not bounce in the normal way. Instead, it would seemingly bite into the pitch and then rise sharply in a most unpredictable way as it turned in the air or spun. The batsmen needed to \"kill\" both the rise and spin of the ball as soon as it hit the pitch, so quick reflexes and footwork were necessary to deploy the necessary defensive strokes. If the ball could not be stopped as it pitched, \"it had to be followed and, if possible, left alone by the means of the last moment dropping of the wrists at which both batsmen were masters\".\nThe tributes that have been paid to Hobbs and Sutcliffe after this partnership are extensive. Pelham Warner perhaps encapsulated them all when he wrote: \"Hobbs and Sutcliffe won it for us by their incomparable batting. They did not fail us at a time of most desperate crisis. Never has English cricket known a more dauntless pair\". Sutcliffe's own innings was described by Monty Noble as \"a masterpiece\".\nIn the 1926 County Championship, Yorkshire lost the title despite being unbeaten to their close rivals Lancashire by a very narrow margin. Sutcliffe was 2nd in the national batting averages behind Hobbs, scoring 2,528 runs at 66.52 with 8 centuries and a highest score of exactly 200 against Leicestershire. The Yorkshire team was mostly unchanged from 1925 except that Mitchell made more appearances and Wilf Barber made his debut.\n1927 English cricket season.\nThere was no Test cricket in England in the 1927 season, the last time this has occurred outside of the war years. New Zealand made a first-class tour and played a programme against mainly county sides but its team had not yet been granted Test status. They played Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford, in July but the match was ended early by rain. Holmes carried his bat for 175 not out after Sutcliffe had been dismissed for 42 in Yorkshire's only innings.\nIn the 1927 County Championship, Yorkshire finished 3rd but it was another great season for both Holmes and Sutcliffe who scored over 4,500 runs and 12 centuries between them. Sutcliffe scored 2,414 runs at 56.13 with 6 centuries and a highest score of 227 for England \"versus\" The Rest. The team was still largely unchanged with Mitchell moreorless a first reserve ahead of Barber and Turner. Arthur Wood made his debut in 1927 and would succeed the retiring Dolphin next season. Another retiree was Lupton and that brought into question the Yorkshire captaincy as opinions were sought about who should succeed Lupton.\nYorkshire captaincy incident.\nIn the autumn of 1927, the Yorkshire committee decided to appoint Sutcliffe as team captain in succession to Arthur Lupton, who had retired. He would thus have become the first professional to captain the side since 1882 but, as \"Wisden\" records, \"objection was taken to this action by two different parties\". There were those who supported the view that no professional should be captain; and significant opposition also came from a large number of members who argued that, if a professional were to be appointed, it should be Wilfred Rhodes rather than Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe himself was \"en route\" to South Africa while most of the furore developed and had to rely on telegrams for his news. When first advised of the appointment, he sent a reply that spoke of the great honour and his desire to serve Yorkshire and England. But he was better apprised of the controversy when he arrived in Cape Town and finally sent a message that he was declining the offer but willing to serve under any other captain.\nThe committee then appealed to William Worsley who agreed to \"step into the breach\" and he held the post through 1928 and 1929, his only two seasons in first-class cricket. The incident had little if any effect on Sutcliffe and he continued his Yorkshire career after his return from South Africa, loyally supporting Worsley and getting on with his colleagues. Like Sutcliffe, Worsley had served in the Green Howards during the war, although he did see action and was both wounded and captured.\nThe actions of Lord Hawke and his supporters on the committee may have been influenced by Sutcliffe's gentlemanly persona and the fact that his sportswear business in Leeds was by then well established. For example, Alan Gibson described Sutcliffe as \"a gentleman (with) impeccable manners\" who was \"a good public speaker\". The general perception was that Sutcliffe was not a typical professional cricketer, whereas Rhodes was always perceived as the archetypal professional.\nYorkshire did not appoint a professional captain in the 20th century until Vic Wilson in 1960, even though Len Hutton captained England as a professional in the 1950s while playing for Yorkshire. Alan Gibson expressed a view that Sutcliffe should have been made captain and posed an intriguing \"what if?\" scenario by saying that Sutcliffe might then have been appointed England captain in 1931. In that case, Sutcliffe would have led the England tour of Australia in 1932–33 instead of Douglas Jardine. Although Sutcliffe backed Jardine's deployment of the bodyline tactic, no one can say what tactics he would have adopted himself in Jardine's position. Sutcliffe said later that he regretted having to withdraw his acceptance. His son Billy, who went to a public school and was an amateur player, became Yorkshire captain in 1956."

        "title": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1928–1932)",
        "text": "During the five years 1928 to 1932, Herbert Sutcliffe played throughout the period for Yorkshire, continuing his highly successful opening partnership with Percy Holmes which reached its peak of achievement in 1932 when they set a then world record partnership for any wicket of 555, the stand including Sutcliffe's career highest score of 313. For England in Test cricket, Sutcliffe made his only tour of South Africa in 1927–28 and his second tour of Australia in 1928–29, during which he played arguably the greatest innings of his career. In the winter of 1930–31, he and Jack Hobbs went on a private tour of India and Ceylon which has caused some controversy in terms of their career statistics. Sutcliffe opened the innings for England throughout the period, playing in home series each season but most notably against Australia in 1930.\nSutcliffe made 181 first-class appearances with 254 innings in which he was not out 36 times, scoring 15,529 runs for a total average of 70.35.\n1927–28 MCC tour of South Africa.\nOn the 1927–28 tour of South Africa, Sutcliffe's only tour of that country, he played in 14 matches and scored 1,030 runs at 51.50 with 2 centuries and a highest score of 102. He was able to open the England innings with Holmes, Hobbs having declined the tour, and made his score of 102 in the first innings of the First Test at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg, England winning by 10 wickets. In the Second Test at Newlands in Cape Town, Holmes and Sutcliffe shared 140 for the first wicket in the second innings, Holmes scoring 88 and Sutcliffe 99. England won by 87 runs. Sutcliffe was the first England batsman ever to be dismissed for 99 in a Test innings. After the Third Test was drawn, South Africa recovered well to square the series with wins in the Fourth and Fifth Tests.\n1928 English cricket season.\nIn 1928, Sutcliffe scored 3,000 runs in a season for the first time, a feat he repeated in 1931 and 1932, becoming the first player to achieve it three times. Only Patsy Hendren and Wally Hammond have equalled the feat. Sutcliffe's 1928 tally was 3,002 at 76.97 with a highest score of 228 among 13 centuries and 13 half-centuries. It was not enough to help Yorkshire regain the championship as, although they were unbeaten, too many drawn games meant they finished 4th behind Lancashire.\nIt was a time for change in the Yorkshire team. William Worsley had replaced Lupton as captain and Arthur Wood had replaced Dolphin as wicket-keeper. Abe Waddington had also retired and his replacement was nominally fast bowler Frank Dennis, although Yorkshire often included Wilf Barber as an extra batsman. Tragically, Yorkshire also lost Roy Kilner who died in April. Arthur Mitchell now came into the team on a regular basis. Sutcliffe was becoming one of the more senior players but he still had several stalwart colleagues in Holmes, Oldroyd, Leyland, Rhodes, Robinson and Macaulay.\nSutcliffe played in all three Tests against West Indies in 1928. This was West Indies' inaugural Test series and their batsmen struggled against a strong England attack so that England was able to win all three Tests by an innings. But Sutcliffe was very impressed by the fast bowling of Learie Constantine, George Francis and Herman Griffith and said of them during the Lord's Test that he had \"never played finer fast bowling\". In the First Test at Lord's, England won by an innings and 58 runs; Sutcliffe opened with Charlie Hallows and made 48. In the Second Test at Old Trafford, England won by an innings and 30 runs; Sutcliffe opened with Hobbs, who had recovered from an injury, and made 54 in a first wicket partnership of 119. In the Third Test at The Oval, England won by an innings and 71 runs; Sutcliffe and Hobbs put on 155 before Sutcliffe was out for 63, while Hobbs went on to make 159.\n1928–29 MCC tour of Australia.\nUnder the leadership of Percy Chapman, Sutcliffe toured Australia again in 1928–29 with Hobbs as his opening partner. Although they both did well and produced one of their most memorable partnerships in the Third Test, they were overshadowed by Wally Hammond who scored a record 1,553 runs at 91.35 in just 13 tour matches with 7 centuries and a highest score of 251. In contrast, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored 2 centuries apiece and neither accomplished 1,000 tour runs.\nEngland won the first two Tests before Hobbs and Sutcliffe played major roles in one of the most famous Test matches ever at Melbourne. The First Test at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground began with Hobbs and Sutcliffe putting on 85. Sutcliffe was dismissed for 38 and Hobbs soon followed him. Having reached 217–5, England looked set to record a modest total but then Patsy Hendren, playing perhaps his greatest Test innings of 169, held things together and England reached 521. Hendren shared an 8th wicket partnership of 124 with pace bowler Harold Larwood who then won the match for England by taking 8 wickets and 4 catches. In the England second innings, Hobbs and Sutcliffe put on only 25 and Sutcliffe scored 32. England's team at this time has been called its best ever but, ominously, the match featured the Test debut of Don Bradman, though he could only make 18 and 1 as England won by the massive margin of 675 runs. In the Second Test at Sydney, England won by 8 wickets after a brilliant innings of 251 by Hammond and fine bowling by Larwood, Maurice Tate and George Geary. Hobbs (40) and Sutcliffe (11) began with 37 but were not called upon in the second innings as Chapman sent in his tailenders to get the 16 runs needed to win.\nThe Third Test at Melbourne saw Australia win the toss and bat first. They made 397 thanks to centuries by Alan Kippax and Jack Ryder. England scored 417 with 200 by Hammond and 58 by Sutcliffe. Australia then scored 351 with 107 by their captain Bill Woodfull and a maiden Test century by Bradman. This left England needing 332 to win. Australia had ended the 5th day (it was a timeless match) on 347–8 and the pitch was showing increasing signs of wear. Overnight, a storm broke and soaked the pitch which, as the sun shone on it through the morning, became what Bradman later described as \"the worst sticky I ever saw\". The Melbourne pitch was \"infamous as the worst in the world after rain and under a hot sun\". Even \"Wisden\" admitted that it \"may fittingly be described as a beastly wicket\".\nPlay on the sixth day did not begin until 12:51 and Australia's last two wickets quickly fell with just 4 runs added to their overnight total. Clem Hill reckoned that the state of the pitch was such that \"odds of ten to one against an England success would be generous\" and Hugh Trumble reportedly told Jack Hobbs that 70 would be a good total. \"Wisden\" recorded that \"then it was that the wonderful skill of these two (Hobbs and Sutcliffe) showed itself so prominently for, with the ball turning and getting up almost straight, they put on 105 for the first wicket... the two batsmen rendered England splendid service by an historic stand and made victory probable\". Having survived the last 5 minutes before lunch, they added 75 in the afternoon session when \"the ball was turning and at other times getting up almost straight\". Hobbs had nearly been dismissed early on when a catch was dropped but the two batsmen played with \"remarkable footwork, masterly defence and unerring skill in a difficult situation\". Hobbs was out when the score had reached 105 and then Sutcliffe added another 94 in partnership with Douglas Jardine as the wicket eased and close of play was safely reached with the total at 171–1 (Sutcliffe 83 not out). Next morning, with conditions much more favourable, Sutcliffe batted on until he was finally out for 135 with the total on 318–4 and only 14 more needed. There was a slight scare as three more wickets fell, including Chapman who was caught at cover when trying for the winning hit. But the runs were obtained and England had won a famous victory against the odds by 3 wickets. Sutcliffe later said that he considered this to have been his finest innings ever. Jardine later wrote about the number of times Hobbs and Sutcliffe were hit \"all over the body\" during their stand and made the point that, if a batsman is to make runs on an Australian sticky wicket, then being hit by the ball is inevitable.\nEngland's victory in the Third Test also secured the series and meant that the team had retained the Ashes. England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide Oval by 12 runs after Hobbs (74) and Sutcliffe (64) began the match with a stand of 143 before both were out on the same total. They both failed in the second innings but another big century by Hammond was enough to ensure the England victory.\nSutcliffe missed the Fifth Test at Melbourne and England lost by 5 wickets. He finished the series with an aggregate of 355 at an average of 50.71 runs in four Tests, while his overall first-class aggregate on the tour was 852 runs at 53.25 with 2 centuries, the historic 135 at Melbourne being his highest score.\n1929 English cricket season.\nIn 1929, Sutcliffe scored 5 centuries against the South African tourists. The first was 113 for Yorkshire in a drawn match at Bramall Lane. He then scored four in the Test series, including two in the same match in the Fifth Test at The Oval. In the First Test at Edgbaston, Sutcliffe opened the innings with debutant Tom Killick, sharing stands of 59 and 34 in a drawn match. Sutcliffe scored 26 and 114. In the second innings, he and Hammond (138 not out) added 221 for the 2nd wicket. The Second Test at Lord's was also drawn. Sutcliffe scored 100 in the first innings after Killick had been dismissed cheaply but only 10 in the second. England were in a strong position at the end with South Africa struggling on 90–5, chasing a target of 293. England won the Third Test at Headingley by 5 wickets. Sutcliffe opened with Ted Bowley and scored 37 and 4. England won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by an innings and 32 runs but Sutcliffe and Bowley were both out cheaply and a 3rd wicket partnership of 245 by Bob Wyatt and Frank Woolley enabled England to recover from 36–2 to 281–3.\nSutcliffe enjoyed one of his greatest Test matches at The Oval where he scored a century in each innings with 104 and 109 not out. He opened with Hobbs again and their partnerships were worth 38 and 77. In the second innings, Sutcliffe and Hammond (101 not out) added 187 for the 2nd wicket. The match was drawn and England won the series 2–0.\nSutcliffe's 1929 season aggregate was 2,189 runs at 52.11 with 9 centuries and a highest score of 150 against Northamptonshire. Yorkshire finished 3rd in the County Championship behind Nottinghamshire and Lancashire after these three teams had taken part in a keen contest which was decided when Lancashire and Yorkshire both lost vital matches in August. The team was unchanged from the 1928 season except that Dennis played more often. Bill Bowes made his championship debut.\n1930 English cricket season.\nIn 1930, Sutcliffe was the leading Englishman in the first-class batting averages behind Don Bradman (i.e., of batsmen with 10 completed innings). In a summer of hot, thundery weather that produced some exceptionally bad pitches, Sutcliffe averaged 87.61 in the four Tests he played in, scoring 161 in the Fifth Test at The Oval. He missed the Second Test due to a thumb injury sustained in the First Test.\nIn a series dominated by Bradman, England began very well and won the First Test at Trent Bridge by 93 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe began with a stand of 53 before Sutcliffe was out for 29. England scored 270 and then dismissed Australia for only 144. In the second innings, Hobbs and Sutcliffe put on 125 before Hobbs was out for 78. Sutcliffe and Hammond took the score on to 134 when Sutcliffe, who had scored 58, was hit on the right thumb which split very badly and forced him to retire from the match. A mini-collapse followed but then Hendren, who scored 72, galvanised the innings and England ended with 302, setting Australia a target of 429. Despite Bradman's first century (131) of the series, Australia was all out for 335. Sutcliffe's injury kept him out of the Second Test at Lord's and he could only look on as Bradman scored 254 to lead Australia to a 7 wicket victory.\nSutcliffe returned for the Third Test at Headingley which is memorable for Bradman's astonishing performance in scoring a then-record 334 in the first innings with 309 on the first day alone. Although he received solid support from Woodfull and Kippax, Australia's total of 566 was comparatively low given that it included an individual score of 334. Hobbs and Sutcliffe began England's response with 53 before Hobbs was dismissed for 29 and Sutcliffe not long afterwards for 32. Thanks to a century by Hammond, England reached 391 but, 175 behind, were forced to follow on. Rain now took a hand and the last two days were ruined, England eventually concluding at 95–3 with Sutcliffe 28 not out. The weather ruined the Fourth Test at Manchester too. Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring 345. England had made 251–8 when the match ended. In what was Jack Hobbs' penultimate Test, he and Sutcliffe shared their final century partnership for England, putting on 108 before Hobbs was out for 31. Sutcliffe soon followed, having scored a patient 74 out of 115–2.\nThe Fifth Test at The Oval saw Sutcliffe at his best as he scored 161 in the first innings, the same score he had made on the famous sticky wicket in the corresponding match in 1926. \"Wisden\" recorded that he \"brought off some splendid hits to square-leg and to the on, while his off-driving was admirable (and) he did not give a chance\". Sutcliffe's innings was the mainstay in a total of 405 which looked a good score given that this was a series decider, but Bradman struck again with a superb 232 and, well-supported by Bill Ponsford, he led Australia to a formidable total of 695. Sutcliffe tried hard in the second innings and made a fighting 54 but to no avail as his team were all out for 251. Australia won the match by an innings and 39 runs and recovered The Ashes by a 2–1 series margin.\nSutcliffe's first-class aggregate in 1930 was 2,312 runs at 64.22 with 6 centuries and a highest score of 173 against Sussex. Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind Lancashire and Gloucestershire. Alan Barber replaced Worsley as Yorkshire's amateur captain but played for one season only. Of greater significance was the retirement of the man who many saw as the true Yorkshire captain, Wilfred Rhodes. But one legend was replaced by another as Hedley Verity immediately stepped into Rhodes' boots, making 10 championship appearances and taking 52 wickets. Sutcliffe made only 13 appearances in the championship as a result of Test calls and his thumb injury. The team in 1930 lacked balance with a lot of changes taking place but a typical line-up was Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Mitchell, Robinson, Wood, Rhodes or Verity, Alan Barber, Macaulay and Bowes. The likes of Wilf Barber, Frank Dennis and future captain Frank Greenwood made occasional appearances.\n1930–31 visit to India and Ceylon.\nDuring the winter of 1930–31, Hobbs and Sutcliffe went on a private tour of India and Ceylon that was organised by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram (popularly known as \"Vizzy\"). There is debate in some quarters about the status of matches played on this tour, which are not recognised as first-class by \"Wisden\" in contrast to certain other publications. The scores were printed in \"The Cricketer\" Spring Annual in 1932 and presented as first-class but escaped general notice at the time and were largely ignored until some statisticians took an interest in them in the 1970s. It is known that neither Hobbs nor Sutcliffe thought they were first-class matches; they regarded them as exhibition games arranged for Vizzy's personal entertainment. Nevertheless, Sutcliffe scored 532 runs and 2 centuries in the disputed matches and this has impacted his first-class statistical record with two versions in circulation.\nSutcliffe went to India and Ceylon having declined to join the concurrent MCC tour of South Africa. England lost that series 1–0 and \"Wisden\" bemoaned his absence: \"The absence of the famous Yorkshireman became a very serious matter when Andy Sandham, after scoring 72 and 6 in the opening games, met with a motor accident which prevented him from playing any more during the whole course of the tour\". As a result of the series defeat in South Africa, England replaced Percy Chapman with Douglas Jardine as team captain.\n1931 English cricket season.\nNew Zealand toured England in the \"wet and cheerless summer\" of 1931 and lost the Second Test to England by an innings, the other two being drawn because of bad weather. Sutcliffe played in the Second and Third Tests at The Oval and Old Trafford respectively and had just two innings, scoring 117 and 109 not out. Jack Hobbs had retired from Test cricket and Sutcliffe had two opening partners, Fred Bakewell and Eddie Paynter, the latter not normally an opening batsman.\nIn all first-class cricket in the 1931 season, Sutcliffe scored four centuries in consecutive innings and averaged 96.96, topping the first-class averages for the first time. He totalled 3,006 runs with a highest score of 230 among 13 centuries. Yorkshire historian J. M. Kilburn commented on Sutcliffe's general consistency as \"almost past believing\" while Sutcliffe himself reckoned that his accomplishments in 1931, which was a wet summer, were the best of his entire career.\nIt was a great season for Yorkshire also as they finally won the County Championship for the first time since 1925. Although Wilfred Rhodes had retired, the Yorkshire team, captained by another short-term amateur appointee in Frank Greenwood, still featured Emmott Robinson and had Holmes, Sutcliffe, Leyland, Oldroyd and Mitchell at the top of the batting order, Arthur Wood keeping wicket and match-winning bowlers in Macaulay, Bowes and Verity. Wilf Barber was the main reserve and an interesting debutant was Arthur Booth, 15 seasons before he was finally able to make his mark as another match-winning bowler.\n1932 English cricket season.\nWhen Yorkshire played Gloucestershire at Park Avenue, Bradford, in July, Sutcliffe completed his 100th century. He was the first Yorkshire player and the seventh overall to achieve the feat. Having scored 83 in the first innings, he reached his target with 132 in the second. Yorkshire won the match by 133 runs. Yorkshire honoured the occasion by presenting Sutcliffe with a cheque for 100 guineas, repeating Surrey's reward paid to Jack Hobbs when he scored his 100th century.\nIn Yorkshire's match against Essex at Leyton, Holmes and Sutcliffe set a world record partnership for any wicket of 555. This remained the world record for any wicket till 1945–46 and it was not until 1976–77 that it was beaten for the first wicket. It remains the record partnership for any wicket in England. Sutcliffe's share of the stand was 313, his career highest score. Yorkshire batted first and, at the end of the first day, the score stood at 423–0, with Holmes on 180 and Sutcliffe on 231, already beating their previous best stand of 347 against Hampshire in 1920. Bowes and Verity then proceeded to bowl Essex out twice and Yorkshire won by an innings and 313 runs.\nWhen Yorkshire played Essex again at Scarborough, Sutcliffe scored 194 to help Yorkshire to an innings victory, though Bill Bowes was the real matchwinner with 13 wickets. Sutcliffe and Maurice Leyland added 149 for the 4th wicket and, in one six-over period, they scored 102 runs.\nSutcliffe scored 3,336 runs in 1932, the highest season total of his career and it included his highest individual score of 313, made in the world record stand at Leyton. He averaged 74.13 with 14 centuries and 9 half-centuries. He became the third batsman after K. S. Ranjitsinhji and C. B. Fry to score 1,000 runs in a month twice in the same season, making 1,193 in June and 1,006 in August. His total of 3,336 is the sixth highest season aggregate behind Denis Compton (3,816 in 1947), Bill Edrich (3,539 in 1947), Tom Hayward (3,518 in 1906), Len Hutton (3,429 in 1949) and Frank Woolley (3,352 in 1928). His fourteen centuries in the season have been bettered only by Compton (18 in 1947), Jack Hobbs (16 in 1925) and Wally Hammond (15 in 1938).\nLargely on account of Sutcliffe's runs and the bowling of Bowes and Verity, Yorkshire were able to win 15 of their last 16 games and retain their County Championship title. Although Frank Greenwood was still the club captain, he only played in 6 championship matches and it was newcomer Brian Sellers who led Yorkshire in most of their matches. Sellers soon became one of Yorkshire's greatest captains. Percy Holmes missed several matches and Sutcliffe sometimes opened with Wilf Barber who now became a first team regular, especially as Edgar Oldroyd had retired. Seam bowler Arthur Rhodes was a regular player in 1932, replacing the retired Emmott Robinson. Bowes and Verity took well over 100 wickets each with Macaulay now playing a supporting role.\nHolmes and Sutcliffe had less success when they opened the England innings together in the only Test match of the season, played against India at Lord's. Although England won by 158 runs, they relied heavily on two captain's innings by the soon to be infamous Douglas Jardine who scored 79 and 85 not out as England struggled. Holmes and Sutcliffe both failed twice and this ruined Holmes' chances of touring Australia the following winter."

        "title": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1933–1939)",
        "text": "During the seven years 1933 to 1939, Herbert Sutcliffe played throughout the period for Yorkshire during one of the club's most successful phases. His Test career ended in 1935 but he formed a new opening partnership for Yorkshire with the young Len Hutton. In 1939, he was the first Yorkshire player to be called up for military service as the Second World War loomed.\n1933 English cricket season.\nHaving returned to England from the 1932–33 \"bodyline\" tour, Herbert Sutcliffe could not repeat his outstanding form of the 1932 season but he still scored a considerable 2,211 runs at 47.04, although it was his lowest tally in a dry summer since 1921. He completed 7 centuries with a highest score of 205 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. His season highlight was perhaps his score of 113, including ten sixes, against Northamptonshire on a bad pitch at Town Ground, Kettering.\nSutcliffe played in the first two Tests against the West Indies but missed the Third Test because of injury. England won the First and Third Tests while the Second Test was drawn. Sutcliffe had only two innings, scoring 21 in the First Test at Lord's and 20 in the Second Test at Old Trafford.\nYorkshire retained the County Championship, completing a hat-trick of titles since 1931. Brian Sellers was appointed team captain before the season and proved himself a brilliant tactician and leader. The usual Yorkshire line-up was Sutcliffe, Holmes, Mitchell, Leyland, Wilf Barber, Sellers, Wood, Verity, Macaulay, Arthur Rhodes and Bowes. Verity, Bowes and Macaulay all took over 100 wickets in the season and Sutcliffe, Leyland, Mitchell and Barber all exceeded 1,000 runs. Percy Holmes, however, had a poor season by his standards. He was dogged by a painful knee injury sustained in 1932 and could only score 763 runs at 19.65 with a highest score of just 65. In August, Yorkshire announced that they would not re-engage Holmes after the 1933 season and so Sutcliffe lost the opening partner of all his 15 seasons so far at Yorkshire; Holmes and Sutcliffe both thought that Yorkshire were premature in making this decision.\n1934 English cricket season.\nSutcliffe scored 304 runs at 50.66 in four Tests against Australia in 1934. He made three half-centuries with a highest score of 69 not out in the Third Test at Old Trafford. He missed the Fourth Test because of injury.\nIt was hoped that the 1934 series would heal the rift that had arisen between England and Australia as a result of the bodyline series and it succeeded in doing that. With Jardine gone and in the absence of Wyatt, England had a new captain in Cyril Walters of Worcestershire for the First Test at Trent Bridge. He opened the innings with Sutcliffe and they shared a stand of 45 after Australia had been dismissed for 374. Walters was out for 17 and Sutcliffe made 62 in a total of 268. Australia declared their second innings on 273–8, a lead of 379. Although Sutcliffe and Walters made another sound start of 51 before Sutcliffe was out for 24, England collapsed to be all out for 141, Walters making top score with 46. The damage was done by O'Reilly and Grimmett who took 11 and 8 wickets respectively.\nWyatt returned to captain England in the Second Test at Lord's which England won by an innings and 38 runs after centuries by Leyland and Ames were followed by one of Verity's greatest bowling performances. He took 7–61 and 8–43 as Australia floundered. Sutcliffe again opened with Walters but was out for 20 at 70–1, while Walters went to score 82.\nThe Third Test at Old Trafford was drawn after England scored 627 and Australia replied with 491, the two first innings taking play into the final day. England then declared at 123–0, setting Australia a target of 259, impossible in the time remaining. Australia safely reached 66–1 at the close. In the first innings, Sutcliffe batted very carefully and scored slowly. Walters made 52 out of their opening stand of 68 and Sutcliffe went on to make 63. In the second innings, Sutcliffe outscored Walters making 69 not out to his partner's 50 not out.\nHaving missed the drawn Fourth Test at Headingley, Sutcliffe returned for the series decider at The Oval but could do little as Australia won the toss and scored 701 before winning the match by a massive 562 runs. Ponsford (266) and Bradman (244) effectively settled the match and the series with a stand of 451 for the second wicket. Sutcliffe (38) and Walters (64) began with another century stand, scoring 104 before Sutcliffe was caught behind off Grimmett. England could have been made to follow on but Woodfull chose to bat again and Australia extended their lead to over 700. In the final innings, England collapsed against Grimmett and O'Reilly who bowled them out for 145, Sutcliffe making 28.\nSutcliffe's first-class aggregate for the 1934 season was 2,023 runs at 49.34 with 4 centuries and a highest score of 203 against Surrey at The Oval. Yorkshire had a comparatively poor season by their recent standards and finished 6th in the County Championship behind Lancashire. The team was never really settled and the loss of Holmes resulted in a number of opening partnerships being tried. Sutcliffe generally opened with Mitchell but Barber also opened and so, in 14 matches, did a rising star from Pudsey called Len Hutton, who was 18 in June 1934. Sutcliffe and Hutton opened for Yorkshire in one championship match in 1934 which was the game against Essex at The Circle, Kingston upon Hull, in July. They shared 14 in the first innings but then Hutton was out and Sutcliffe went on to make 166. In the second innings, Hutton opened with Mitchell and was out without scoring. Sutcliffe did not bat and Yorkshire won comfortably by 123 runs. Yorkshire had too many players missing several matches each: the team played 30 championship games but none of Bowes, Leyland, Macaulay, Sutcliffe or Verity managed to appear in 20. Cyril Turner and Frank Smailes became first-team regulars.\n1935 English cricket season.\nSutcliffe began the Test series against South Africa at Trent Bridge as England's first-choice opener, partnering Bob Wyatt. They put on 118 for the first wicket before Sutcliffe was out for 61. Wyatt went on to score 149 and South Africa had to follow on but, with rain stopping play, the match was drawn.\nSouth Africa recovered to win the Second Test at Lord's by 157 runs and, as the remaining three Tests were all drawn, this gave them their first series win in England. Sutcliffe again opened with Wyatt and scored 3 and 38, the latter being England's top score in the second innings, which was played after the pitch had been ruined by leatherjackets. England's chief selector Pelham Warner described 1935 as \"the year of the leatherjacket, which had descended on Lord's and caused it to look like the sand on the sea-shore\".\nThis match was Sutcliffe's last Test for England. He was unable through a leg injury to play in the Third Test, in which Wyatt opened with Denis Smith of Derbyshire, but then he never recovered his place when he was fit again. \"Wisden's\" view was that England wished to try out younger players but it pointed out that Sutcliffe \"remains a prolific runscorer\". Sutcliffe's record in Test cricket is outstanding. As shown by the adjacent graph, he is the only English batsman who has averaged more than 60 runs per innings in a completed career and his statistical record compares favourably with anyone except Don Bradman. Uniquely, Sutcliffe's batting average never dropped below 60 throughout his entire Test career and Javed Miandad is the only other player whose average never dropped below 50 in a career of at least 20 innings.\nA new leg before wicket rule was tried in 1935, with the agreement of the South African tourists. Its essential feature was that \"a batsman could be given out if the ball pitched outside the off stump and would, on the umpire's opinion, have hit the wicket, the batsman's leg or legs being in front of the stumps at the moment of impact\". It was, therefore, designed to limit the amount of pad play but the MCC Committee was at pains to obtain the views of numerous parties and a series of conferences were held at Lord's to discuss the ruling, Sutcliffe being invited to one. As an exponent of pad play, Sutcliffe \"anticipated for himself the most lugubrious future\". However, Pelham Warner says it was pointed out to him that \"he was grossly underrating his abilities, which turned out to be true, and he was one of the earliest converts\".\nSutcliffe went on to finish second (i.e., of batsmen playing at least 10 completed innings) in the 1935 first-class averages, behind Walter Hammond, scoring 2,494 runs at 48.90 with 8 centuries and a highest score of 212 against Leicestershire.\nThe end of Sutcliffe's Test career meant that, from then on, he was always available for Yorkshire, who regained the County Championship title in 1935. Verity and Bowes, well supported by Smailes, were again the key bowlers. George Macaulay played his final season and there were two newcomers in Paul Gibb and Ellis Robinson. Sutcliffe scored 1,966 runs in the championship and was easily the county's outstanding batsman. Barber, who had a fine season, Mitchell and the wicket-keeper Arthur Wood were the only others to exceed 1,000 runs. Despite being in the champion team, Yorkshire's batsmen scored only 15 centuries in 30 matches: Barber scored 4 and Wood, Gibb and Hutton scored 1 each. Sutcliffe scored 8.\nLen Hutton, born in June 1916, was still short of his 19th birthday when he and Sutcliffe opened together against Kent at Park Avenue, Bradford, on Saturday, 1 June 1935. On a difficult, turning wicket, they had to face Kent's great leg spinner Tich Freeman (who took 13 wickets in the match) and managed to put on 70 together before Yorkshire collapsed to an all out 131, leaving Kent with a first innings lead of 51. Kent extended that lead on the Monday morning to 191 and Yorkshire, faced with a sticky wicket after heavy overnight rain, were not expected to win. Thanks to an obdurate and watchful innings by Sutcliffe, who made an outstanding 110, they did win by two wickets. Sutcliffe scored so slowly at times that some of his own supporters began to complain but Sutcliffe silenced them, after finally taking a single, by holding out his bat and inviting them to come and do better. It was humorously done and the crowd laughed. Sutcliffe had a good sense of humour but rarely showed it when batting, which he regarded as altogether too serious a business for jest.\n1936 English cricket season.\nThe demands of Test cricket behind him, Sutcliffe played in 29 of Yorkshire's 30 County Championship matches in 1936 but his average fell to 33.30, his worst seasonal performance since the early 1920s. He scored 1,532 runs with a highest score of 202 against Middlesex at Scarborough among just 3 centuries.\nOne of his best performances was an innings of 129 against Surrey at Headingley as he shared a first wicket partnership of 230 with Hutton (163). Leyland scored 163 not out and Yorkshire's total of 519–6 declared enabled them to win by an innings and 185 runs after Bowes and Smailes took the necessary wickets. The innings of 202 against Middlesex followed a batting collapse by the opposition after Smailes with 7–72 bowled them out for only 127. Sutcliffe and Leyland (107) added 187 for the third wicket as Yorkshire scored 469. Middlesex had no answer to Bowes, Smailes and Verity in their second innings and were dismissed for 172 and Yorkshire won by an innings and 170 runs against the team that finished runners-up in the championship.\nYorkshire finished 3rd in the County Championship behind Derbyshire, who claimed their first-ever title. The preferred Yorkshire line-up was Hutton, Sutcliffe, Leyland, Mitchell, Barber, Turner, Sellers, Verity, Wood, Smailes and Bowes. A promising newcomer was the future England captain Norman Yardley. Verity, Smailes and Bowes all took more than 100 wickets and Leyland, Sutcliffe and Hutton exceeded 1,000 runs. Sutcliffe now had Hutton as his established opening partner and Hutton was making steady progress, scoring 1,108 championship runs at 29.94 with a highest score of 163 against Surrey at Headingley, which was his only century that season.\n1937 English cricket season.\nSutcliffe's form rallied somewhat in the last three seasons of his career and he formed another outstanding opening partnership with Len Hutton who matured into a Test-class batsman in 1937. In all first-class matches, Sutcliffe scored 2,162 runs at 44.12 with 4 centuries and a highest score of 189 against Leicestershire at Hull. Sutcliffe and Hutton put on 315 for the first wicket in that match, Hutton scoring 153.\nYorkshire regained the County Championship and this owed much to the strength of the opening partnership as Sutcliffe and Hutton scored 3550 runs between them in championship matches. Other good scores were achieved by Barber, Leyland, Mitchell, Turner, Sellers, Wood and Yardley. Frank Smailes was a very useful all-rounder and Ellis Robinson was successful with his off spin but Verity was again the outstanding bowler. Bowes missed several championship matches but still averaged about four wickets per game.\n1938 English cricket season.\nIn 1938, Sutcliffe scored 1,790 runs in all first-class matches at 41.62 with 5 centuries and a highest score of 142. Despite several players taking part in the Test series, Yorkshire won a second successive County Championship title. Sutcliffe, Leyland, Barber and Mitchell all scored more than 1,000 runs in the championship and Sellers made 999. Verity, Bowes, Robinson and Smailes were a formidable bowling unit.\nSutcliffe faced Australian opposition for the final time in 1938 when he appeared in two matches against the tourists. The first of these matches was in July for Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. The match ended at lunch on the third (final) day because of rain but Yorkshire were in the ascendant. Having dismissed the Australians for 222, Yorkshire had responded with 205 (Sutcliffe 24) but then Bowes, Smailes and Verity had bowled Australia out for only 132 in the second innings. This was the close of play situation at the end of the second day so Yorkshire needed just 150 to win on the final day. They reached 83–3 at lunch with Sutcliffe going well on 36 not out. Sutcliffe faced Australia for the final time in September at North Marine Road in a Scarborough Festival match when he played for H D G Leveson Gower's XI. Leveson-Gower's XI won by 10 wickets after Bowes and Verity destroyed the Australian batting in the second innings. Sutcliffe had scored 25 in the first innings and he finished with an unbeaten 36 as he and Hutton guided their team to its target of 46.\n1939 English cricket season.\nYorkshire completed another hat-trick of County Championships in 1939, the regular players being Sutcliffe, Hutton, Leyland, Mitchell, Barber, Yardley, Turner, Sellers, Smailes, Wood, Verity and Bowes. A notable debutant was future Test player Willie Watson. Sutcliffe had injury problems during the season and played in only 21 first-class matches, scoring 1,416 runs at 54.46 with a highest score of 234 not out against Leicestershire at Hull among 6 centuries.\nSutcliffe was now 44 and certainly a \"veteran\" but he enjoyed a remarkable sequence of four consecutive centuries in May and June which showed any doubters that he was still one of the best opening batsmen around. Starting with the Roses match at Old Trafford on 27 to 30 May, he scored 165 as Yorkshire replied with 528 for 8 declared to Lancashire's first innings total of 300. Sutcliffe and Mitchell (136) added 288 for the second wicket. Bill Bowes (6–43) dismissed Lancashire for 185 in their second innings and Yorkshire won by an innings and 43 runs. In the next match on 3 to 6 June, Sutcliffe and Hutton equalled their best partnership of 315 against Hampshire at Bramall Lane, Sutcliffe scoring 116 and Hutton 280 not out. Hampshire won the toss and decided to bat but were bowled out for a modest 174 in only 62.4 overs. Sutcliffe and Hutton scored 122 by close of play and then took the partnership to 315 on the second morning before Sutcliffe was bowled by George Heath. Hutton and Barber then advanced the score to 480–1 at which point Sellers declared to allow his bowlers time to dismiss Hampshire again. They achieved this with Hutton, only ever a change bowler, surprisingly taking 4–40 and Yorkshire won by an innings and 129 runs. Bill Bowes (6–43) dismissed Lancashire for 185 in their second innings and Yorkshire won by an innings and 43 runs. Yorkshire then went home to play Leicestershire at The Circle, Kingston upon Hull on 7–9 June. They won this by an innings and 30 runs after Leicestershire had batted first and scored 366. Leicestershire's top scorer was New Zealand Test batsman Stewie Dempster who scored 165 not out. Dempster is one of the handful of batsmen who had a better Test batting average than Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe led the Yorkshire reply by scoring 234 not out as Yorkshire declared at 500–7. Sutcliffe and Yardley (74) shared a century stand for the fourth wicket. Leicestershire's batting was then destroyed by Verity with 8–38 and they were all out for 104 (Dempster 29). In the next match against Middlesex at Lord's on 10 and 12 June, Yorkshire won by an innings and 246 runs after Sutcliffe (175) and Leyland (180 not out) added 301 for the third wicket. Sutcliffe was finally caught and bowled by Denis Compton. Middlesex's batsmen had no answer to Bowes and Verity who bowled them out for 62 and 122.\nAlthough Sutcliffe was to play one more first-class match in 1945, his career effectively ended in August 1939 when he played for Yorkshire against Hampshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground, Bournemouth, on Saturday, 26 August and Monday, 28 August. Yorkshire won by an innings and 11 runs in just two days. Sutcliffe and Hutton put on 56 before Hutton was out for 37 and Sutcliffe went on to score 51 before he was out at 117–2, leg before wicket to George Heath, who thus took his wicket for the second time in 1939."

        "text": "Brian Hayes (born 25 September 1990) is an Irish rugby union player.

        "title": "Mark Nicholls (rugby union)",
        "text": "Marcus Frederick Nicholls (13 July 1901 – 10 June 1972), generally known as Mark Nicholls, was a New Zealand rugby union player and selector. He played for New Zealand—the All Blacks—as well as Wellington and the North Island. A member of the legendary 1924–25 All Black \"Invincibles\", Nicholls was best known as a first five-eighth though he actually played many games, including Tests, at either second-five eighth or centre. Hugely influential in his day, he has largely become forgotten in modern times although George Nēpia and Bert Cooke, two of his better-remembered contemporaries, acknowledged the significance of his role in assisting their success.\nBackground.\nMark was born to a noted sporting family from Petone. His father Syd was a co-founder of the Poneke Football Club in Wellington in 1883, his brothers Harold \"Doc\" and Harry \"Ginger\" were briefly All Blacks in the early 1920s, while his sister Dulcie won several national tennis titles during the 1930s.\nMark began playing rugby as a hooker at Petone West Primary School. He was moved into the backs by coach Jimmy Lynskey at Petone District High School, and he captained the 1st XV at age 15. In 1917 he transferred to Wellington College where he went straight into the 1st XV, captaining the team in 1918 and 1919. Upon completing school, he returned to Petone to play for the local club's senior team. His performances were so eye-catching he was almost immediately selected to play provincially for Wellington where he made such an impression he was drafted into the All Blacks for the Test series against the touring Springboks in 1921.\nInfluence as a player.\nThough he only played 10 Tests between 1921 and 1930, Nicholls' influence ran deep particularly in positional kicking and in general play. George Nēpia recalled that he \"plays his rugby as other people play chess, by a series of openings which are aimed at an end result utterly confusing to the other side.\"\nSpringbok legend and rival fly-half, Bennie Osler regarded him as \"the best fly-half I ever played against\" even though he only ever faced Nicholls once in a 10-year international career. The match Osler was referring to was the Fourth Test between New Zealand and South Africa in Newlands in 1928 which saw Nicholls out-Osler Osler himself with his positional kicking in the wet and muddy conditions. Nicholls then went on to score all his team's points and ensure a surprise 13–5 victory for the All Blacks to square the series at 2–2, the best result for New Zealand in South Africa for 68 years. The normally taciturn Springbok coach \"Boy\" De Villiers was moved enough by the performance to note that: \"Like the (South African) forwards and Bennie won the first Test match, so did the (All Black) forwards and Nicholls win the last Test match.\"\nMidfield general.\nThough not a great try scorer himself, Nicholls managed only 5 in 51 games as an All Black, it was his ability to set up his outside backs to score that saw teammates like Bert Cooke profit; \"Mark baked the cake, and Bert iced it.\" \nThis ability was never more apparent than on the Invincible All Blacks tour of Great Britain and France in 1924/5. Often Nicholls' style of play was to run across the field on a diagonal feigning to pass to one teammate or another looking for a weakness in the opposition's back-line. Once one was spotted, he would pass to a teammate and set him free into the gap. To the forward play obsessed British, it was a tactic they found almost blasphemous – although John Wisden's rugby Football Almanac was impressed enough to name Nicholls one of their Players of the Year and even credited him with being responsible for most of the All Blacks' tries.\nControversial nature.\nPerhaps one of the reasons Nicholls played so few Tests was due to his personality. Described variously as \"outspoken\" and \"coarse\" he was also known to be conceited, regarding himself as \"the only player who was ever any good.\"\nThis abrasive nature may have contributed to his being overlooked for the first three Tests of the monumental four match Series against the 1928 Springboks. The South Africans themselves were baffled as to why Nicholls had not been selected before the decisive Fourth Test with their tactical genius Bennie Osler musing: \"Why this player was so consistently overlooked throughout the tour I will never know, but we Springboks were certainly grateful that Mark did not get more opportunities against us.\"\nBehaving badly.\nNicholls certainly had form for obnoxious behaviour; an altercation with a rugby official on the 1922 tour of New South Wales had seen him ignored for All Black selection altogether the following year.\nJournalist Graham Beamish, who toured Britain with the Invincibles, later had a theory that certain teammates harboured resentments from that 1924 tour where the British press had repeatedly praised Mark Nicholls as the \"brains\" of the team. And that these resentments had resurfaced again on the 1928 tour with the former teammates now using their status as senior players to block Nicholls' place in the side via \"persistent selection of players who had not the genius of Nicholls.\"\nA brilliant comeback.\nBut these resentments were forced to give way to desperation after the third Test of the tour with South Africa having taken an unassailable 2–1 lead in the series. The senior players relented on their policy of non-selection for Nicholls and brought him in from the cold to try and square the series. Mark repaid their contrition by scoring all the All Blacks' 13 points in a virtually single-handed demolition of the Springboks in the Fourth Test to spare his fellow New Zealanders' blushes.\nMethod to the madness.\nGeorge Nēpia certainly saw method to Nicholls' caustic madness, claiming that in team meetings en route to Britain in 1924 Mark's overt criticism of his play had been to deliberately get \"a rise out of me so that I shall start thinking of fullback play, deeply and earnestly. That is Mark – thinking ahead, always thinking.\" \nThis approach of playing mind games with his teammates certainly seemed to have paid off with around 90% of the matches involving Mark Nicholls as an All Black ending in victory.\nLater career.\nNicholls went on to be a Wellington and North Island Selector throughout the 1930s and also played cricket to Senior Club level. After a stint working for New Zealand Railways, he became a publican at several hotels around the country before retiring to Tauranga where he died in 1972. A son, Mark Junior, also played for Petone and made one appearance for Wellington Province.\nLegacy.\nIt is difficult to pinpoint just how influential Nicholls has been to the All Blacks' style of play down the decades as even the exploits of other better-known players such as; George Nēpia, Bert Cooke, Billy Wallace, Dave Gallaher and Billy Stead have been largely lost to most modern fans. Some modern rugby writers still rate Mark Nicholls as amongst the greatest All Black first five-eighths ever to play. Perhaps Grant Fox was the last great All Black first five eighth to show a similar dominant kicking game and intense chess player-like thinking on the football field. But there is no shortage whatsoever of modern All Blacks who share the same determination to win as Marcus Frederick Nicholls."

        "title": "Jack Combs (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Jack Combs (born January 26, 1988) is an American former professional ice hockey forward.\nPlaying career.\nPrior to turning professional, Combs played for the California Wave Midget team for one season and for five seasons with the Kitchener Rangers and Saginaw Spirit of the Ontario Hockey League. Combs attended the training camp of the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League in 2008 before he signed with the Alaska Aces for his first professional season in 2009–10. After 11 games with the Aces, Combs was traded to the Trenton Devils of the ECHL. On April 5, 2010, Combs signed a Professional Try Out contract with the Peoria Rivermen of the American Hockey League For his second season, Combs signed with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League, an affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche. Establishing a formidable partnership alongside linemate Chad Costello, Costello and Combs ranked 9th and 10th, respectively, in total points (84 and 82) in the league in 2010-11.\nOn August 18, 2011, Combs, alongside his Tulsa linemate Costello, signed with the Colorado Eagles of the ECHL. After combining with Costello to lead the league in scoring after 23 games with 37 points in the 2011–12 season, Combs signed mid-season with the Worcester Sharks of the American Hockey League.\nCombs returned to the Eagles the following season and scored 42 points (19 goals and 23 assists) in 27 games. His partnership with Costello was signified when they both were signed to Professional Try Out contract with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League on December 18, 2012. On January 9, 2013, Combs and Costello were both signed by the Sound Tigers to Standard Player Contracts for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. Combs played in 22 games with the Sound Tigers for 14 points (5 goals and 9 assists) before he was traded to the San Antonio Rampage in exchange for future considerations on March 14, 2013.\nAfter starting the 2013-14 season playing 19 games for the Rampage and 8 games for the Cincinnati Cyclones, the Rampage's ECHL affiliate, the Rampage traded Combs to the Oklahoma City Barons in exchange for Derek Nesbitt.\nFor the 2014-15 season, Combs signed with the Russian club Toros Neftekamsk of the Supreme Hockey League (VHL). After only 11 games, Combs opted to leave Toros Neftekamsk and return to North America. On October 21, 2014, Combs signed a contract with the Allen Americans of the ECHL to re-unite with Chad Costello. Though he was leading the ECHL at the time in scoring for the 2014-15 season with 56 points, Combs signed with the Swedish club IF Björklöven of HockeyAllsvenskan in January 2015. In light of Combs' departure, the Americans waived him on February 14, 2015. Due to his desire for more ice time than the team could offer and to rejoin the Allen Americans, Combs was released by IF Björklöven on February 14, 2015 after playing only three games. Combs' attempt to rejoin the Americans was stifled when his ECHL rights were claimed off of waivers by the Stockton Thunder on February 15, 2015.\nCombs reported to the Thunder and played 11 games for the team, accumulating 5 goals and 8 assists. With the Thunder out of playoff contention, Thunder Head Coach Rich Kromm fulfilled a promise made to Combs and placed him on waivers on March 17, 2015 to try to help Combs re-join the Americans.\nCombs' attempt to return to the Americans was again stifled when his ECHL rights were claimed off of waivers by the Missouri Mavericks. Before playing a game for the Mavericks, Combs was released by the team on March 24, 2015, which again placed Combs' ECHL rights on waivers. On March 25, 2015, Combs' ECHL rights were claimed off of waivers by the Cincinnati Cyclones, to which he did report, playing his first game for the team on March 27, 2015.\nOn September 16, 2015, Combs earned an AHL contract, agreeing to a one-year deal with the Hartford Wolf Pack. After attending the Wolf Pack training camp, he was assigned to ECHL affiliate, the Greenville Swamp Rabbits to begin the 2015–16 season. In splitting the year between the two club, Combs appeared in 18 games for the Wolf Pack with 2 goals and 4 points.\nOn July 11, 2016, Combs embarked on another European contract, agreeing to a one-year deal with newly promoted DEL club, Fischtown Pinguins. He scored 27 goals in 51 contests in the 2016-17 regular season, which made him the league's leading goal-scorer that year. Combs left Bremerhaven after the 2016-17 season and signed with fellow DEL side Iserlohn Roosters in May 2017.\nOn October 24, 2019, Combs returned to playing hockey in North America by signing with the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL.\nFollowing two further European seasons, on October 15, 2021, Combs opted to return to North American and join former club, the Allen Americans of the ECHL, on a one-year deal."

He threw right-handed, batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nGraham broke into professional baseball as a third baseman. He was selected by the Twins in the fifth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball Draft and three times exceeded 20 home runs during his minor league career. After debuting in MLB by going hitless in two June games for the 1979 Twins, he was acquired by Baltimore that off-season and optioned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings to begin the campaign. In 16 games, he batted .346 with four home runs, earning a call-up to the Orioles in May. In his second game, May 10 against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium, he started at catcher and collected his first MLB hit, and homer, off Lary Sorensen. In his next two starts, May 13–14 against the Texas Rangers at Memorial Stadium, Graham had seven hits in nine at bats, including his second big-league home run. His success at the plate led manager Earl Weaver to use him on a semi-regular basis, along with right-handed-hitting Rick Dempsey. Graham started 65 games at catcher, with Dempsey starting 95.\nFor the season, Graham hit 15 home runs and drove home 54 runs batted in in 286 plate appearances, batting .278.\nIn 1981, Graham spent his only full season in the Majors, but his production plummeted to only 25 hits in 142 at-bats (.176) with two home runs. He finished his pro career with Rochester in 1982.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Venezuelan Winter League"

        "title": "2012 World Series",
        "text": "The 2012 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2012 season. The 108th edition of the World Series, the series was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants and the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers; the Giants won in a four-game sweep. This marked the Giants' seventh World Series title in franchise history, their second in San Francisco (they won five in New York), and their second in a three-year period (2010–2012). Their World Series sweep was the first by an NL team since the Cincinnati Reds swept the Oakland Athletics in the 1990 series and the first NL sweep not by the Reds since 1963, when the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the New York Yankees. This was also the first World Series since 1988 to feature both of that year's League MVPs (Miguel Cabrera for the AL and Buster Posey for the NL). The Giants' Pablo Sandoval, who in Game 1 tied a record by hitting three home runs in one World Series game — two off Tigers' ace pitcher Justin Verlander — was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP).\nThe San Francisco Giants held home field advantage for the World Series due to the NL winning the 2012 MLB All-Star Game: San Francisco hosted Games 1 and 2, and would have hosted Games 6 and 7 if these had been necessary to decide the Series. The 2012 series began on Wednesday, October 24, at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, California and ended on Sunday, October 28, at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan, with the conclusion of the fourth game.\nThe Tigers advanced to the World Series after sweeping the Yankees in four games during the American League Championship Series. The Giants advanced to the World Series after winning the National League Championship Series four games to three over the St. Louis Cardinals, the 2011 World Series winners.\nAs of 2023, this is the most recent World Series to end in a sweep, 11 World Series have been played in this span.\nBackground.\n2012 All Star Game.\nIn accordance with the standard since 2003, the outcome of the All-Star Game decided whether the American or National League would hold home field advantage in the World Series. The National League All-Star Team won the 2012 All-Star Game, played on July 10 in Kansas City, Missouri, by a score of 8–0. Representatives of both the Giants and the Tigers played key roles in the outcome. Giant players scored and/or drove in seven of the NL All-Star team's eight runs. The NL scored five runs in the first, all yielded by a Tiger, ace Justin Verlander. Pablo Sandoval would hit a triple, and Melky Cabrera—who would wind up the All-Star Game MVP—hit a home run during the game.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nThe Giants finished the regular season atop the National League West with a 94–68 record, eight games ahead of the second place Los Angeles Dodgers and good enough to secure the #3 seed in the NL. They defeated the second-seeded Cincinnati Reds in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five series, in five games. They then defeated the defending 2011 World Series champions, the fifth-seeded St. Louis Cardinals, in a seven-game series to capture the National League pennant. The manner in which the Giants defeated the Reds and then the Cardinals created some historical firsts.\nBecause of the addition of a wildcard game, the National League Division Series between the Giants and Reds began with two games in San Francisco. Cincinnati, who posted a better won-lost record than the Giants, hosted the final three games. The Giants lost the first two games at home in San Francisco, yet won the last three on the road. The Giants became the first major league team to win three straight road games in a best-of-five playoff series after losing the first two games at home. In the second round of the playoffs, the National League Championship Series, they came back from a three-games-to-one deficit to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals. Through this playoff course, the 2012 Giants became the first National League team and the second team in American major league baseball history (after the 1985 Kansas City Royals) to win six consecutive playoff games in which they had faced elimination. This was the Giants' 22nd NL pennant overall, their fifth as the San Francisco Giants. Their World Series berth was their second in three years (since , when they defeated the Texas Rangers in five games). This was the fifth World Series in which the Giants faced a team from the American League Central Division (1917, 1924, 1933, 1954).\nSan Francisco's notable preseason acquisitions were outfielders Melky Cabrera and Ángel Pagán. Cabrera set the Giants' franchise record for hits in the month of May, with 51, and Pagán set the San Francisco Giants record for triples in a season, with 15. On August 15, Major League Baseball meted a 50-game suspension upon Cabrera for his use of a banned substance. At the time, his 159 hits led both leagues, his .346 batting average measured second in the NL, and he had received the 2012 All-Star Game MVP. The suspension expired after the NLDS, but the Giants opted not to add him to the team's NLCS or World Series rosters.\nAll-Star Buster Posey finished the regular season with a .336 batting average to win the 2012 NL batting championship. In the World Series, he would go on to catch every inning, including the shutouts in Game 2 and Game 3. He would homer in Game 4. He would, in the World Series, not allow any baserunners to advance by either passed ball, stolen base, or wild pitch. He would begin a double play in Game 1 and execute an important tag play in Game 2.\nEarlier in the regular season, starting pitcher Matt Cain threw the first perfect game in Giants history, and the 22nd in American major league history, on June 13. He would start Game 4 of the World Series, which the Giants would win to clinch.\nRelief pitcher Sergio Romo contributed to team success by converting 14 out of 15 save opportunities after an injury sidelined closer Brian Wilson a few days after the season began. Romo converted three saves in the World Series, including the Game 4 clincher, which ended with Romo striking out the 2012 American League MVP.\nMidseason addition Marco Scutaro ended the regular season with a .306 batting average and a 20-game hitting streak. In October, Scutaro tied a League Championship Series record with 14 hits (and a .500 average) against the Cardinals, and he received the NLCS MVP. In the World Series, his Game 4 tenth-inning single drove home a run that gave the Giants a lead the team would not relinquish.\nBruce Bochy made his third World Series appearance as a manager, his second with the Giants. Bochy led San Francisco to the 2010 title. Before that, he led the 1998 San Diego Padres to the World Series, where the New York Yankees swept. Bochy would win his second World Series title.\nBochy's starting rotation for the 2012 World Series: Barry Zito in Game 1, Madison Bumgarner in Game 2, Ryan Vogelsong in Game 3 and Matt Cain in Game 4.\nDetroit Tigers.\nThe Tigers finished the regular season atop the American League Central, with 88 wins and 74 losses. The Tigers repeated as champions of this division, having also won it in 2011. This was their first repeat title in the divisional-play era (i.e., since 1969). The last time, before 2011–2012, that the Tigers franchise had made consecutive playoff appearances was 1934–1935.\nThe Tigers entered the postseason as the third seed in the AL, and defeated the second-seeded Oakland Athletics in the American League Division Series three games to two. The Tigers then captured their 11th American League pennant, sweeping the top-seeded New York Yankees four games to none in the American League Championship Series. This World Series berth was their first since , when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated them four games to one. The Tigers entered the World Series as heavy favorites to win the title, despite the Giants having home-field advantage and the better regular season record.\nThe 2012 Tigers became the fourth team to accomplish a four-game sweep in an ALCS. The three other teams to do so (1988 Oakland A's, 1990 Oakland A's, and 2006 Detroit Tigers) did not win the World Series, and the 2012 Tigers would, in the 2012 World Series, continue this trend.\nPitcher Justin Verlander (17–8) led the American League in strikeouts with 239. Max Scherzer (16–7) finished second in the AL with 231 strikeouts. During the 2012 season, pitcher Doug Fister set an AL record by striking out nine consecutive batters.\nMiguel Cabrera became the first player in 45 years (since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967) to win the Triple Crown. Miguel Cabrera compiled a .330 average, hit 44 home runs, and had 139 RBIs, all of which led the American League. In the 2012 ALCS, Cabrera extended his hitting streak in LCS games to 17, a major league LCS record. (Cabrera made ten hits in seven games with the Florida Marlins in the 2003 NLCS, eight hits in six games with the Tigers in the 2011 ALCS, and five hits in the Tigers' 2012 ALCS sweep.) , Miguel Cabrera has played in exactly 17 LCS games. Miguel Cabrera would compile a .231 batting average for, and make the last out of, the 2012 World Series.\nIn January 2012, prior to the start of the season, the Tigers signed first baseman Prince Fielder to a nine-year, $214 million contract. In the 2012 World Series, Prince Fielder would manage only one hit, a single, in 14 at-bats.\nManager Jim Leyland made his third trip to the World Series, and his second with the Tigers (he also managed them in 2006). He managed the 1997 Florida Marlins to a seven-game victory in the World Series.\nLeyland's starting rotation for the 2012 World Series: Verlander in Game 1, Doug Fister in Game 2, Aníbal Sánchez in Game 3, and Scherzer in Game 4. In Game 1 of the World Series, Verlander would not fare much better against Giant bats than he had in the All-Star Game; allowing five earned runs in four innings.\nSummary.\nThe Giants' Pablo Sandoval was named the MVP of the series after hitting .500 with three home runs.\nUmpiring crew.\nGerry Davis, as senior umpire, served as crew chief for the six-man crew. With his work in this Series, Davis set a new record for postseason games umpired in American major league history, with 115.\nFellow regular-season crew chiefs Brian Gorman and Joe West assisted Davis, along with Fieldin Culbreth, Dan Iassogna and Brian O'Nora.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe Giants jumped out to a 6–0 lead, scoring in four of the first five innings of Game 1, en route to an 8–3 victory. Pablo Sandoval went four-for-four, driving in four runs on three home runs. He joined Babe Ruth (in 1926 and 1928), Reggie Jackson (in 1977) and Albert Pujols (in 2011) as the only players to ever hit three home runs in one World Series game. Sandoval became the first to hit three homers in Game 1 of a World Series and homer in his first three plate appearances. Tigers ace pitcher Justin Verlander lasted only four innings, giving up five Giant runs. Sandoval's first two homers came off Verlander, a two-out home run in the first and two-run home run in the third after Angel Pagan doubled with two outs and scored on Marco Scutaro's single. Sandoval's third home run came in the fifth off Al Alburquerque. San Francisco starting pitcher Barry Zito allowed only one run in innings, and drove in a run with a fourth-inning single. The one run came in the sixth when Austin Jackson doubled to lead off and scored on Miguel Cabrera's single. The Giants scored their final two runs in the seventh inning off Tiger relief pitcher José Valverde, who failed to convert saves in previous stages of the postseason. Pagan doubled with one out, then scored on Scutaro's single. After Sandoval singled, Scutaro scored on Buster Posey's single. In the top of the ninth, Jhonny Peralta hit a two-run home run off George Kontos to cut the lead to 8–3, but Jeremy Affeldt came in relief of Kontos and got Ramon Santiago to ground out for the final out of the game to give the Giants a 1–0 series lead.\nAfter Zito allowed a run on three hits in the sixth inning, Tim Lincecum relieved him. Lincecum pitched perfect innings, striking out five. Three Cy Young Award winners (Lincecum, Verlander and Zito) pitched in Game 1, the first time this has happened since Game 3 of the 1983 World Series, when Jim Palmer relieved Mike Flanagan, in a contest against Steve Carlton.\nGame 2.\nA shutout win in Game 2 gave the Giants a two-games-to-none lead in the Series. In the top of the second, with Prince Fielder on first, Delmon Young lined a double into the left field corner. Tiger third base coach Gene Lamont waved Fielder home, but with accurate throws by left fielder Gregor Blanco and second baseman Marco Scutaro, catcher Buster Posey tagged out Fielder in a close play at the plate. In the bottom of the second, Doug Fister was struck in the head by a Blanco line drive but stayed in the game, pitching out of a bases-loaded jam. Game 2 remained scoreless until the bottom of the seventh. Hunter Pence led off with a single, Brandon Belt drew a walk, then Blanco executed a perfect bunt down the third base line. The ball came to rest just fair, halfway between third base and home, allowing Blanco to reach safely while both runners advanced. With the bases loaded and nobody out, Brandon Crawford grounded into a double play, scoring Hunter Pence. In the eighth, with the bases loaded and one out, Pence hit a sacrifice fly to right field, scoring Ángel Pagán with the second and final Giant run of the game. Madison Bumgarner pitched seven shutout innings, yielding only two hits and striking out eight, for the win.\nGame 3.\nThe Giants' 2–0 victory in Game 3 was the team's second straight shutout. Matching the 2010 Giants team that also recorded two shutouts in the World Series, San Francisco became the first team since the 1966 Baltimore Orioles to record back-to-back World Series shutouts. (The 1966 Orioles, who threw three straight shutouts in Games 2–4, also swept the World Series, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers.) The 2012 Giants became the first NL team to do so since the 1919 Cincinnati Reds, who threw back-to-back shutouts against the Chicago White Sox. These were the first back-to-back postseason shutouts for the franchise since 1917, where the New York Giants ultimately lost to the Chicago White Sox.\nThe only runs of the game came in the Giant half of the second inning. A one-out triple off the bat of Gregor Blanco scored Hunter Pence from third. A two-out single by Brandon Crawford then scored Blanco.\nSan Francisco starter Ryan Vogelsong pitched shutout innings. Detroit loaded the bases with one out in the fifth inning. Vogelsong struck out Quintin Berry. Then, Vogelsong threw a pitch near the hands of the next batter, Miguel Cabrera, which induced a pop fly to end the inning. As in Game 1, Tim Lincecum relieved the Giants' starter, and pitched scoreless innings. As in Game 2, Sergio Romo converted a save, his second of three in the Series.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 extended into extra innings. Marco Scutaro's RBI single in the top of the tenth, which allowed Ryan Theriot to score, proved the difference in the Giants' 4–3 victory. With the Game 4 victory, the Giants took the 2012 World Series, four games to none.\nSan Francisco scored the first run of the game, in the top of the second inning. With one out, Brandon Belt tripled off starter Max Scherzer to right field, scoring Hunter Pence. Belt was stranded at third after a groundout and a flyout.\nIn the third inning, Detroit took its first lead in any series game. Austin Jackson walked and Miguel Cabrera hit a high fly ball off Matt Cain towards right field, Hunter Pence had a chance to catch it but a strong wind drifted the ball out for a two-run home run. The shot snapped what was a 20-inning scoreless streak for the Tigers.\nThe Giants regained the lead in the sixth inning, with a two-run home run, off the bat of Buster Posey. Posey's shot stayed just inside the left-field pole as it carried out. In the bottom of the same inning, Delmon Young tied the game with a home run to right, off Giant pitcher Matt Cain, that landed over the fence in right-center. However, this was the last hit for the Tigers in the game.\nStrong relief pitching sent the game into extra innings. After a leadoff walk in the bottom of the eighth, Giant pitcher Jeremy Affeldt struck out the heart of the Tigers batting order. In the top of the ninth, Tiger pitcher Phil Coke struck out three consecutive Giant batters. Coke set a World Series record by striking out seven consecutive batters, dating back to his appearances in Games 2 and 3. Affeldt and Santiago Casilla combined for a scoreless bottom of the ninth.\nIn the top of the 10th, Ryan Theriot ended Coke's strikeout streak, leading off with a single to right. A sacrifice bunt by Brandon Crawford moved Theriot to second. Ángel Pagán struck out. Then Scutaro served a single in front of center-fielder Austin Jackson, which scored the decisive run.\nCloser Sergio Romo struck out the side in the bottom of the 10th. The Series ended with umpire Brian O'Nora calling a third strike on Miguel Cabrera. After throwing Cabrera several consecutive sliders, Romo threw a fastball that backed into Cabrera's zone, which may have surprised the batter.\nBecause they won the Series away from their home field, the Giants accepted the World Series Championship Trophy and the World Series MVP award in their locker room. (Incidentally, the franchise clinched its last four World Series victories away from home.) The Giants' unexpected sweep of the Tigers was deemed as a significant upset by the media.\nComposite line score.\n2012 World Series (4–0): San Francisco Giants (N.L.) beat Detroit Tigers (A.L.)\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, Fox televised the games, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play in his 15th World Series, and Tim McCarver handling color commentary for his 23rd World Series. Ken Rosenthal also appeared on the Fox telecasts as a field reporter, with Erin Andrews and Chris Myers joining him for select games. MLB International syndicated its own telecast of the series, with announcers Gary Thorne and Rick Sutcliffe, to various networks outside the U.S.\nAdditionally, the American Forces Network and Canadian Forces Radio and Television carried the games to U.S. and Canadian service personnel stationed around the globe. Fox Deportes carried the Series in Spanish on American cable and satellite TV.\nHowever, on August 24, Tribune removed Fox-affiliate WTIC-TV from Cablevision systems in Connecticut, causing viewers to miss Games 1 and 2 of the series. An agreement between Cablevision and Tribune was reached on October 26, the day before Game 3.\nRatings.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the four-game series on Fox averaged a record-low 7.6 rating and 12 share. The previous low was an 8.4 rating for both the 2008 and the 2010 World Series, which each went five games. The 6.1 rating in Game 3 matched the lowest rating for any World Series game with Game 3 in 2008; that year, a rain delay moved the start of the game to after 10 p.m. on the East Coast with the game not ending until 1:47 a.m. Hurricane Sandy contributed to the low number of viewers as most residents on the East Coast were preparing for the storm's arrival during the series.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast the World Series nationally, with Dan Shulman and Orel Hershiser working their second consecutive World Series together. ESPN Deportes Radio aired the Series for Spanish language listeners, with Ernesto Jerez and Guillermo Celis announcing.\nLocally, the two teams' flagship stations broadcast the series with their respective announcing crews. The Giants' English-language broadcasts aired on KNBR (with Dave Flemming, Jon Miller, Mike Krukow, and Duane Kuiper announcing) with their Spanish-language broadcasts on KIQI (with Erwin Higueros and Tito Fuentes), while WXYT-FM and AM carried the Tigers' English-language broadcasts (with Dan Dickerson and Jim Price). Due to contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games, although the local broadcasts were also available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com.\nHistorical notes.\nThe Tigers became only the third team to be swept in the World Series after sweeping the League Championship Series (LCS), joining the 1990 Oakland Athletics and the 2007 Colorado Rockies with this distinction.\nFor the fourth time since 1985, when the MLB postseason expanded the LCS to a best of 7, the World Series saw a team who swept its LCS face a team who won a LCS Game 7. The previous three times, , , and , the Game 7 pennant-winner prevailed. This trend continued in 2012.\nThe 2012 World Series was the first since 1954 to feature the batting champions from each league, Buster Posey of the Giants and Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers (the 1954 Series showcased Willie Mays of the New York Giants and Bobby Ávila of the Cleveland Indians). Cabrera and Posey had been voted the MVP of their respective leagues (announced and awarded, as usual, after the World Series), making this the first World Series since 1988 to feature both league MVPs (1988 saw the Oakland Athletics' Jose Canseco and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson meet).\nThe Giants became the first team since the 1966 Baltimore Orioles and the first NL team since the 1919 Cincinnati Reds to achieve consecutive shutouts in the World Series. Giants pitching held the Tigers to a .159 batting average in the Series, the 3rd lowest for a team all-time in the World Series, behind the Los Angeles Dodgers hitting .142 against the Orioles in the 1966 World Series and the Baltimore Orioles hitting .146 against the New York Mets in the 1969 World Series.\nWith the Giants winning Game 4 in extra innings to win the series, they became the eighth team to win a World Series-clinching game in extra innings and the first to do so since the 1997 Florida (now Miami) Marlins clinched the series in Game 7 in 11 innings. They were the first Giants team to do so since Game 5 of the 1933 World Series against the Washington Senators (now Minnesota Twins) in Washington when the Giants were in New York. After sweeping this series 4–0, Bruce Bochy became the fourth World Series Manager to be on a winning side and losing side of a sweep, having lost in a four-game sweep against the New York Yankees as the San Diego Padres manager in 1998. Miller Huggins, Walter Alston and Tony La Russa were the other three.\nTo date, this is the most recent World Series sweep.\nAs the Giants represented the National League during the 1912 World Series (though at the time they were based in New York), the Giants became the first team to play in the World Series a century after an appearance. The Red Sox would later accomplish this feat in 2018.\nAftermath.\nAn estimated crowd of over 1 million people attended a Halloween Day victory parade along Market Street in San Francisco.\nThe Giants failed to defend their World Series championship in 2013. San Francisco led the National League West early in the season, but critical injuries (including the loss of Pagan for three months) and subpar play on both ends doomed the Giants. They were eliminated from the playoff race on September 11, 2013, becoming the second defending World Series champion in three years to not make the postseason, after the 2011 Giants. In 2014, the Giants would, again, win the World Series and thereby continue their even-years streak of pennants and World Championships (2010, 2012, and 2014) .\nThe Tigers would win the American League Central division championship for the third straight season in 2013, marking the first season since 1909 that the Tigers won three consecutive regular season titles. The Tigers lost the 2013 ALCS to the eventual champions Boston Red Sox in six games, which was also Jim Leyland's final season as manager. In 2014, under new manager Brad Ausmus, they won their fourth-straight division title, but lost the ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles. The Tigers soon fell into rebuilding mode for the next several seasons, bottoming out with a 47–114 mark in 2019. Miguel Cabrera, the last Tigers player remaining from the 2012 team, retired after the 2023 season.\n2012 Detroit Tigers co-aces Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer faced off in the World Series seven years later in 2019. Scherzer, then with the Washington Nationals, bested Verlander's Houston Astros in seven games, although they never pitched against each other. 2012 Tigers' starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez also pitched in the 2019 World Series for the Nationals. Verlander did win a World Series ring with the Astros two years earlier, and added a second in . Another starting pitcher from that team, Rick Porcello, later won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox. Drew Smyly, who pitched out of the bullpen for two games in the World Series but served as a fifth starter during the regular season prior to Sanchez's acquisition, later won a World Series for the Atlanta Braves.\nVerlander and Scherzer were briefly re-united in 2023 when Verlander signed a record free-agent contract with the New York Mets. There had been rumors in Detroit that the two aces did not get along, but the rumors were never confirmed or denied. Verlander entered 2023 at age 40, while Scherzer would turn 38 in July, making them two of the oldest pitchers to ever start together in a rotation. At a combined $86.6 M, they were also the two most expensive pitchers to ever head a rotation, as well. The reunion would not last, however, and the Mets traded both Scherzer and Verlander to in-state rivals Texas Rangers and Houston Astros respectively, after struggling to begin the season. Ironically, both the Astros and Rangers met in the 2023 ALCS, and like in the 2019 World Series, neither pitcher opposed each other in a game. Ultimately, Scherzer's Rangers bested Verlander's Astros in seven games, again with the road team winning every game."

        "text": "The 2013 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2013 season. The 109th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals; the Red Sox won, 4 games to 2 to win their eighth championship. The Red Sox had home field advantage for the series, based on the AL's win in the 2013 MLB All-Star Game on July 16. This was the first World Series since 1999 to feature both number one seeds from the AL and NL. The Series started on October 23, 2013, ending with Game 6 on October 30, 2013.\nThe Red Sox won the first game at Fenway Park on October 23, followed by the Cardinals winning the second game on October 24 to tie the series, 1–1. The series then moved to Busch Stadium, where the Cardinals won the third game on October 26 to gain a 2–1 lead. The Red Sox won the fourth game on October 27 to tie the series at 2–2, then won the last of three games at Busch Stadium on October 28 for a 3–2 lead. The series then moved back to Fenway Park, where the Red Sox decisively won the final game on October 30, becoming the World Series champions for 2013.\nThis was the fourth meeting of the Cardinals and the Red Sox in the World Series (previously meeting in , , and ). It was also the first World Series since to feature two teams with identical regular season records. Winning in six games, the Red Sox clinched their first World Series championship at their home field of Fenway Park since , and the most recent edition where the championship was clinched by the home team until the 2022 World Series (before that, the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series as the designated home team, but at a neutral site). David Ortiz was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He became the first non-Yankee to win three World Series titles with one team since Jim Palmer (Baltimore Orioles 1966, 1970, and 1983).\nBackground.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals finished the 2013 regular season at 97–65, earning the best record in the National League. They set a new Major League Baseball record for hitting efficiency with runners in scoring position, hitting .330 (447–for–1,355), the best in baseball since the Boston Red Sox hit .312 in 1950, also beating the 2007 Detroit Tigers, and 1996 Colorado Rockies with a .311 average.\nDespite losing first baseman Albert Pujols to the Angels and manager Tony La Russa to retirement after their 2011 World Series triumph, the Cardinals under new manager Mike Matheny still came within one game of a return trip to the World Series, but lost the final three games to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in the 2012 National League Championship Series. However, with the help of Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak, the Cardinals were able to stay in contention even with a roster consisting mostly of rookies, free-agent veteran additions, and a few holdovers from the 2011 championship team.\nThe Cardinals' offense was led by catcher Yadier Molina, second baseman Matt Carpenter, and first baseman Allen Craig, all of whom finished in the top 10 in batting average. They were joined by outfielders Carlos Beltrán and Matt Holliday, third baseman David Freese, and first baseman Matt Adams. The Cardinals' pitching staff were led by Adam Wainwright, who returned to form after posting an NL-leading 19 wins. Wainwright was joined by youngsters Lance Lynn, Joe Kelly, Shelby Miller, and late-season call-up Michael Wacha. Wainwright's return to form, along with the emergence of the young starters, helped fill the void left by star pitcher Chris Carpenter, who missed the entire season due to various injuries. The bullpen were also powered by youngsters, led by closer Trevor Rosenthal, set-up man Carlos Martínez, and middle relievers Seth Maness and Kevin Siegrist.\nThe top-seeded Cardinals opened the playoffs by defeating the #4 seed Pittsburgh Pirates in five games in the Division Series. Then, in their third consecutive National League Championship Series appearance, St. Louis defeated the third-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers four games to two for their 19th National League pennant.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAfter finishing last in the AL East with a 69–93 record in 2012, the Red Sox fired Bobby Valentine and hired John Farrell as their new manager. Under Farrell, the team finished the 2013 regular season at 97–65, the best record in the American League.\nIn the aftermath of the infamous September collapse in 2011 and the ill-fated Valentine experiment of 2012, general manager Ben Cherington brought in Farrell, a former pitching coach under Terry Francona, and several role players in hopes of turning the Red Sox around. The Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 helped inspire a season-long rally for the Red Sox in support of the victims and the city of Boston. In games after the marathon, the Red Sox hung a jersey on the dugout saying \"Boston Strong\" and \"617\", representing the city's area code. The team also wore \"B Strong\" patches in their uniforms. In addition, some of the Red Sox players grew beards during the season as a sign of unity. The inspired play of the Red Sox took them from last place the previous season to American League East champions with a 28-game turnaround, helped by Farrell's calming presence and familiarity with some of the players.\nBoston's offense was powered by designated hitter David Ortiz, who hit .309 during the season. They also relied on the baserunning exploits of center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, whose 52 stolen bases led the major leagues, while right fielder Shane Victorino, second baseman Dustin Pedroia, first baseman Mike Napoli, catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and outfielder Jonny Gomes helped the Red Sox to a league-leading 853 runs scored. The pitching staff was led by Jon Lester, who rebounded from a miserable 2012 campaign to post a 15–8 record and 3.75 ERA. Lester was joined by Clay Buchholz, John Lackey and midseason acquisition Jake Peavy. The bullpen were led by closer Koji Uehara, who unexpectedly took over following injuries to Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey to post 21 saves and a 1.09 ERA. He was joined by compatriot and set-up man Junichi Tazawa, and middle relievers Brandon Workman and Craig Breslow. While Stephen Drew and David Ross were limited offensively, their defense proved to be an asset to the team's success, especially during the postseason.\nThe top-seeded Red Sox opened the playoffs by defeating the fifth-seeded Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the Division Series. Then in the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games to win their 13th American League pennant.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nBoston Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch, as he had done before Game 1 in 2004 and 2007. After Boston starter Jon Lester pitched a scoreless top half of the first inning, St. Louis ace Adam Wainwright found trouble in the bottom of the inning. He walked leadoff batter Jacoby Ellsbury and after an out, Dustin Pedroia singled. Wainwright then got David Ortiz to ground to second base, but Matt Carpenter's flip was mishandled by shortstop Pete Kozma, ending the possibility of a double play. Initially, the Cardinals had been awarded a force-out at second base, but after conferring, the umpires ruled that Kozma never had control of the ball, and Pedroia was reinstated at second base. With the bases loaded and one out, Mike Napoli doubled to left-center, scoring Ellsbury, Pedroia and Ortiz, the latter after Shane Robinson misplayed a carom off the wall. In the bottom of the second inning, Stephen Drew led off with a pop-up in front of the pitcher's mound. Wainwright and catcher Yadier Molina both converged, but both let the ball drop for a leadoff single. David Ross then singled to center field, followed by a flyout by Ellsbury. Shane Victorino then hit a ground ball to deep short, but Kozma again mishandled it, his second error of the game, and once again the bases were loaded with one out. Pedroia then singled under the glove of a diving David Freese to make the score 4–0. Ortiz then hit a deep fly to right field, but was robbed of a grand slam by Carlos Beltrán. Ross did tag and score to give Boston a 5–0 lead. Beltrán would leave the game, with Robinson moving to right field, and Jon Jay taking over in center. Meanwhile, Lester was brilliant for the Red Sox, pitching scoreless innings. The Red Sox added to their lead in the bottom of the seventh with Ortiz hitting a two-run home run off Kevin Siegrist to give them a 7–0 lead. After the Red Sox plated another run in the eighth inning, the Cardinals finally got on the board with Matt Holliday leading off the ninth with a home run off Ryan Dempster. Dempster recovered and closed out the 8–1 victory by striking out Matt Adams. Lester was accused of using a foreign substance on his glove, but he claimed that it was just rosin, which is legal, and the Cardinals organization elected to not file a complaint.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 pitted the NLCS MVP Michael Wacha against the Red Sox' John Lackey. Several members of the 2004 Red Sox championship team, including Pedro Martínez, threw ceremonial first pitches. After three scoreless innings, Matt Holliday led off the fourth inning for the Cardinals with a triple to center field. After Matt Adams lined out, catcher Yadier Molina grounded out softly to Dustin Pedroia to score Holliday and give the Cardinals a 1–0 lead. The Red Sox threatened in the bottom half as the first two batters reached with Pedroia leading off with a double and David Ortiz drawing a walk. Mike Napoli then grounded into a double play to partially kill the threat and Wacha got Jonny Gomes to pop out to Matt Carpenter to end the inning. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Red Sox finally got on the scoreboard, as Pedroia walked with one out and Ortiz hit a two-run home run to left center field on a 3–2 changeup to give the Red Sox a 2–1 lead. In the seventh inning, the Red Sox' defense let them down. With one out and the bases loaded (David Freese walked, Jon Jay singled and Daniel Descalso walked), Carpenter hit a fly ball to Gomes in left field for the second out. With Pete Kozma, who pinch-ran for Freese, scoring on the throw, the ball got away from catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia. Jay and Descalso attempted to advance on the misplay and pitcher Craig Breslow, who was backing up on the play, tried to get Jay at third but his throw was wild and went into the stands. Jay scored and Descalsco went to third as the Cardinals now led 3–2. Carlos Beltrán then singled to right to score Descalso and give the Cardinals a 4–2 lead. Things got a little interesting in the bottom of the eighth inning. With Carlos Martinez on the mound for the Cardinals, the Red Sox had Jacoby Ellsbury reach on an error and after two strikeouts, Ortiz reached on a single. With two outs, Martinez jammed Napoli and he popped out to short to end the inning. In the bottom of the ninth with the 4–2 lead, Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal entered the game and made quick work of the Red Sox by striking out Gomes, Saltalamacchia and pinch-hitter Daniel Nava on 17 pitches. The Cardinals evened up the series at one game each as the series shifted to St. Louis for the next three games.\nThis was the Red Sox first World Series loss since Game 7 in 1986, and St. Louis snapped Boston's nine-game winning streak in the World Series.\nGame 3.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by 1985 NL MVP Willie McGee. The Cardinals got off to a good start in the bottom of the first inning, putting two on the board from RBI singles by Matt Holliday and Yadier Molina off of Boston starter Jake Peavy. It wasn't until the top of the fifth inning before the Red Sox got on the board themselves, when pinch hitter Mike Carp grounded into a fielder's choice off Cardinals starter Joe Kelly. In the next inning, Boston tied the game at 2–2 on a Daniel Nava single. But in the bottom of the seventh, Matt Holliday hit a line drive off of reliever Junichi Tazawa that just got past a diving Will Middlebrooks that drove in two, and Holliday advanced to third on the throw. Even though this happened with no outs, Holliday was stranded at third. Boston quickly responded in the top of the eighth by loading the bases off Carlos Martínez. Trevor Rosenthal came in to pitch, and the first batter he faced, Daniel Nava, grounded in to a fielder's choice, after a great diving stop by rookie second baseman Kolten Wong. The next batter, Xander Bogaerts, bounced a ball up the middle for an RBI single of his own, knotting the game at 4–4.\nIn the bottom of the ninth inning, Boston reliever Brandon Workman stayed in, having pitched in the eighth inning and having batted in the top of the ninth, striking out in his first professional at bat. He gave up a one out single to Molina. Boston closer Koji Uehara was brought in to face pinch hitter Allen Craig, who doubled on the first pitch. With one out, Jon Jay hit a grounder to second baseman Dustin Pedroia. He made a diving stab and threw home to catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who tagged out the sliding Molina. But then Saltalamacchia threw to third trying to get Craig, who was running on the play. Saltalamacchia's throw was wide, and it pulled third baseman Will Middlebrooks toward the second-base side of the bag. Middlebrooks tried to keep the ball on the infield, but it skipped into foul territory. Craig slid into third, popped up and started for home. He made contact with Middlebrooks, who was lying face-first on the dirt, with his feet in the air. Craig fell, got back up and ran home. Saltalamacchia, receiving the throw from foul territory, applied the tag to the sliding Craig. However, the third base umpire, Jim Joyce, called obstruction on the play; home plate umpire Dana DeMuth determined that Craig would have scored without the obstruction, giving the Cardinals the win and a 2–1 lead in the World Series. The Red Sox were furious about the call, as manager John Farrell stayed out to argue the call, as did most of the players. They protested that Middlebrooks' feet were in the air as he was getting up when Craig ran over him.\nThe largest paid crowd in the history of Busch Stadium (47,432) saw the game. It was the first time in a World Series game that a winning play was on an obstruction call and only the second time in baseball history.\nAs of 2023, this is the Cardinals' last win in a World Series game.\nGame 4.\nThe largest paid crowd in the history of Busch Stadium (47,469) saw the game, surpassing the previous night's record attendance. Hall of Famer and two-time World Series MVP Bob Gibson threw the ceremonial first pitch. After Boston starter Clay Buchholz, pitching through a shoulder injury, was removed for a pinch-hitter after four innings, five Red Sox relievers combined to hold St. Louis to one run on three hits the rest of the way. In the sixth inning, the bases were empty with two outs before Dustin Pedroia singled and David Ortiz walked. Then, outfielder Jonny Gomes came to bat and the Cardinals brought in Seth Maness to face him. Gomes worked the count to 2–2 before he broke the tie with a three-run homer that would become the difference in the game. The game ended when Boston closer Koji Uehara picked off pinch runner Kolten Wong with Carlos Beltrán at the plate, making it the first postseason game in baseball history to end on a pickoff. (However, it was not the first time a World Series game ended with a runner being tagged out during an at-bat; in the 1926 World Series, Babe Ruth was caught stealing for the final out of Game 7.)\nFelix Doubront pitched innings out of the bullpen to earn his first career postseason win. John Lackey, who pitched a scoreless eighth, made his first relief appearance since 2004 and first in the postseason since 2002.\nGame 5.\nHall of Fame inductee Ozzie Smith threw the ceremonial first pitch. In a rematch of the staff who faced off in Game 1, Jon Lester again outdueled Adam Wainwright to give the Red Sox a 3–2 series lead.\nBoston scored first for the first time since Game 1 when Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz hit back-to-back doubles with one out in the first.\nMatt Holliday tied the score with a home run to center in the fourth inning, but it would be the only run Lester would allow over strong innings of work. Wainwright matched Lester until the seventh inning, when a ground-rule RBI double by David Ross and RBI single by Jacoby Ellsbury scored Xander Bogaerts and Stephen Drew to give Boston a 3–1 lead.\nKoji Uehara relieved Lester with two outs in the eighth and retired all four Cardinals he faced to earn his second save of the series.\nUehara tied John Wetteland, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, and Brad Lidge for most saves in one postseason year, with 7 (since then, Greg Holland matched this record the next year). In addition, Lester joined Babe Ruth as the only Red Sox lefthanders to win three World Series games.\nGame 6.\nBoston Red Sox Hall of Fame members Carlton Fisk and Luis Tiant, both of whom played in historic Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, threw ceremonial first pitches. Boston won Game 6 in a rout, by scoring six runs on the Cardinals rookie Michael Wacha, who had previously been unbeaten in the playoffs. World Series Most Valuable Player David Ortiz was walked by the Cardinals four times, and scored twice. Boston's Shane Victorino opened the scoring with a three-run double in the third inning and had four runs batted in. Red Sox pitcher John Lackey pitched six scoreless innings. The Cardinals only seriously threatened in the seventh inning when they scored on Carlos Beltrán's single and had the bases loaded with two outs, but Boston reliever Junichi Tazawa got the final out. Koji Uehara came in again to pitch a perfect ninth, striking out Matt Carpenter swinging to end the game, series, baseball season, and clinch their eighth overall title.\nWith this win, Boston won the championship at Fenway Park for the first time since 1918. The win was the third championship in the last ten seasons for the Red Sox. This was the most recent World Series in which the championship was won by the home team until 2020, which the Dodgers won the series clinching Game 6 as the home team (Game 6 in 2020 was not played at Dodger Stadium due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). The next time a team won at their home stadium was when the Houston Astros won the 2022 World Series.\nThe average list price on the resale market for a ticket to Game 6 was $1,860, according to TiqIQ, a ticket tracking company. This was the final World Series of the 2010s in which the home team won a deciding game and received the Commissioner's Trophy on their home field.\nComposite line score.\n2013 World Series (4–2): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) beat St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)\nSeries Statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFox televised the series in the United States and Canada, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play and Tim McCarver handling color commentary. This was McCarver's 24th and final World Series broadcast (including four with ABC and four with CBS prior to his joining Fox in 1996), as he had announced that he would retire from the network's lead crew following the season. Working with Buck and McCarver were field reporters Ken Rosenthal and Erin Andrews.\nPregame coverage was handled by host Matt Vasgersian, joined by regular analyst Harold Reynolds. They were joined by special guest analysts A. J. Pierzynski of the Texas Rangers (his third consecutive World Series as a guest analyst), and Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies.\nA partnership with Fox Sports featured Pearl Jam as the November artist of month for all entities within the Fox Sports domain and licensed 48 songs from their catalogue to play during the 2013 World Series. The group's music was included in anything from \"opening teases and commercial bumpers to montages, as well as additional promotional inventory across Fox prime-time and cable.\"\nMajor League Baseball International syndicated the television coverage outside Canada and the U.S., with English-language commentary provided by Baltimore Orioles play-by-play announcer Gary Thorne and ESPN analyst Rick Sutcliffe.\nRatings.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the six-game series on Fox averaged an 8.9 rating and 15 share. The 8.9 rating was, by a large margin, the lowest for a six-game World Series (the 2009 World Series that pulled an 11.7 was the prior lowest) and the fourth lowest overall, behind the , and series (the latter holding the record low at 7.6). Game 3, which pulled a 7.4 rating, is the fourth lowest rated MLB World Series game, ahead of just Game 3 of the 2011 World Series (6.6), Game 3 of the 2012 World Series (6.1), and Game 3 of the 2008 World Series (6.1).\nSome analysts expressed alarm at the low ratings, considering the prestigious franchises involved (a combined 20 World Championships and 32 pennants). Boston, moreover, had a storybook narrative because of the recent Boston Marathon bombing, which, some felt, should have attracted casual audiences.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast the series in the U.S., with commentators Dan Shulman and Orel Hershiser. Locally, the two teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their respective announcing crews. Mike Shannon and John Rooney called the games for the Cardinals on KMOX in St. Louis, while Joe Castiglione, Dave O'Brien, and Lou Merloni announced for the Red Sox on WEEI in Boston.\nCelebration.\nFollowing the team's World Series win, Boston Red Sox fans congregated at the site of the Boston Marathon bombing to celebrate the title.\nThe white lights of Boston's Prudential Tower displayed \"GO SOX.\" Red Sox owner John Henry said after the game that the parade would take place on Saturday, November 2.\nOn November 2, the Red Sox parade began at Fenway Park and headed down Boylston Street. The 25 duck boats carrying the players and executives paused at the Boston Marathon finish line where three spectators died during the April bombing.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Red Sox visited the White House and met with President Obama.\nAftermath.\nRed Sox.\nThe 2013 World Series triumph would be the pinnacle of the John Farrell era. The Red Sox went from first to worst in the AL East following the 2014 season, finishing with a 71–91 record. The next season, they improved their record to 78–84, though still in last place in the AL East. In both 2016 and 2017, the Red Sox finished atop the AL East with identical 93–69 records; however, both seasons ended in the division series, losing to the Cleveland Indians 3–0 in the 2016 ALDS, and the Houston Astros 3–1 in the 2017 ALDS. After the 2017 season, Farrell was fired and replaced by Alex Cora, who managed the Red Sox to the 2018 World Series championship.\nThe Farrell era oversaw the departure of Ben Cherington and the entry of Dave Dombrowski as general manager, the retirement of David Ortiz following the 2016 season, and the emergence of Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts, Andrew Benintendi, Jackie Bradley Jr., Brock Holt, Christian Vázquez, Eduardo Rodríguez and Rafael Devers. All-Star caliber players David Price, JD Martinez, Chris Sale and Craig Kimbrel also joined the team. Those players would form the core of the 2018 champion Red Sox, managed by Alex Cora. However, the Red Sox also signed high-priced free agent flops Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramírez, neither of whom became productive players.\nJon Lester, David Ross, John Lackey, Jake Peavy and Franklin Morales would win another World Series with different teams: Peavy with the 2014 Giants, Morales with the 2015 Royals, and Lackey, Lester and Ross with the 2016 Cubs.\nCardinals.\nThe Cardinals' 2013 World Series appearance was also the pinnacle of the Mike Matheny era. In 2014, the Cardinals made their fourth consecutive NLCS after a 90–72 finish and the NL Central title, but lost to the eventual champion San Francisco Giants 4–1. The following season, they won 100 games to once again clinch the NL Central, but lost to their archrival Chicago Cubs in the NLDS. The Cardinals' 86–76 finish in 2016 and 83–79 finish in 2017 ended without a postseason appearance. Midway through the 2018 season, Matheny was fired and replaced by Mike Shildt.\nAdam Wainwright and Yadier Molina would become life-time Cardinals, never playing for another team in their careers. In 2022, they would set the all-time wins record for a battery with their 203rd victory, passing pitcher Warren Spahn and catcher Del Crandall.\nCarlos Beltrán, Joe Kelly and Matt Adams would later win the World Series with different teams: Beltrán with the 2017 Astros, Kelly with the 2018 Red Sox and 2020 Dodgers, and Adams with the 2019 Nationals."

        "text": "The St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball program represented St. Francis College (SFC) in intercollegiate men's basketball up through the 2022–23 season, which was its last in intercollegiate competition. The team was a member of the Division I Northeast Conference. From late November 2022 until March 2023, the Terriers played home games at the Activity Resource Center (branded as \"The ARC\") at Pratt Institute in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. Through the 2021–22 season, they had played in the Daniel J. Lynch '38 Gym in the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex, located on SFC's former Brooklyn Heights campus. However, after the 2021–22 school year, SFC closed its Brooklyn Heights campus to move to a new campus on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn. With the new campus lacking any athletic facilities, SFC arranged to use other nearby venues on at least a short-term basis. The Terriers' final game at the Pope Athletic Complex was held on November 19, 2022. The Terriers have also hosted home games at Madison Square Garden and at the Barclays Center. On March 20, 2023, St. Francis College announced that it would end intercollegiate athletics following the spring semester, making the 2022–23 season the program's final season in existence.\nThe St. Francis Brooklyn men's basketball program was founded in 1896 and is the oldest collegiate program in New York City. The Terriers have an overall record of 1223–1295, 48.6 W–L%, over a 99-year span from the 1920–1921 to the 2019–2020 season. The program has won 6 regular season championships and has participated in 4 National Invitational Tournaments. As of 2010, Glenn Braica was announced as the 17th head coach in the history of the St. Francis Terriers men's basketball program. Braica was previously an assistant under Norm Roberts at St. John's University. Braica, who is in his tenth year with the team, has qualified nine times for the NEC tournament and in 2015 led the team to its first post season tournament in 52 years.\nThe Terriers were one of seven NCAA Division I programs in New York City and in 2011 attending a Terriers game was named one reason to love New York by \"New York Magazine\" in their seventh annual \"Reasons to Love New York 2011\" piece. The Terriers are also one of only four original Division I programs (since 1939) to have never participated in the NCAA tournament. The Terriers have been one win away from participating on three occasions, first in the 2000–01 season, then in the 2002–03 season, and again in the 2014–15 season. Beginning on November 27, 2012, St. Francis College rebranded its Athletics programs from St. Francis (NY) to St. Francis Brooklyn. After the 2022-23 season, St. Francis Brooklyn dropped all intercollegiate athletics, including basketball, from the college after over 120 years of history.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1896–1940).\nThe St. Francis College's men's basketball program was founded in 1896 and was the oldest collegiate program in New York City. The program had players on the court only 5 years after Dr. James Naismith invented the game in 1891. The College's first official game came in 1901 against Brown University. The Boys from Brooklyn, as they were referred to, finished the 1901 season with a 13–1 mark. From the 1902 to the 1920 season the Terrier basketball records are incomplete. Then from 1920 to 1940 the Terriers compiled a 246–187 record and established themselves as a premier basketball program in New York City, playing their home games in Brooklyn. The Terriers had played as Independents for most of these years, but in 1933 they were a founding member of the now defunct Metropolitan New York Conference. During this time period the Terriers hosted their home games in their gymnasium at the Butler Street Campus in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn or at the 13th Regiment Armory.\nThe Terriers had 6 head coaches during this period, the most successful of which was Roger Patrick \"Rody\" Cooney. Who in his 9 years at the helm of the program didn't have a single losing season and compiled a 116–77 record. During this period the Terriers also had their first 20-win season. Cooney's 1935-36 team was the first to participate in a post-season tournament. The Terriers were invited to play in the District 1 tryouts at Madison Square Garden for the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nGolden years (1941–1968).\nJoseph Brennan era (1941–47).\nJoseph Brennan was the Terriers head coach with the highest winning percentage and he was also elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Brennan helped make the Terriers into a popular team during New York City's Basketball glory days of the 1940s and 50s. Due to their popularity the Terriers would play 2 to 3 games a year at Madison Square Garden and the Terriers were one of the few programs hosting Division I games in Brooklyn at the Park Slope Armory, their home court. Brennan's 1941-42 squad averaged 56 points per game, which was quite high during those years. The Terriers also had the first college player to score 20 or more points at Madison Square Garden, Vincent T. Agoglia. He did it twice in the 1941–1942 season, first against LaSalle College of Philadelphia. Brennan ended his head coaching career with a 90–46 (66.2%) record over 7 seasons.\nDaniel Lynch era (1948–1968).\nThe greatest head coach in the program's history was Daniel Lynch. Lynch was a graduate of St. Francis College and played basketball at his alma mater from 1934–38 under head coach Rody Cooney. When Lynch took over in 1948 the Terriers became the first team in the New York City area to have a game televised. The Terriers defeated Seton Hall in its inaugural telecast on WPIX. Lynch is the Terrier head coach with the most wins in the programs history (283). Part of that wins total came during a 6-year span from 1950 to 1956, where Lynch guided the Terriers to five consecutive winning seasons going 121–43. As a tribute, the Terriers home court is in the Daniel Lynch Gymnasium, which is part of the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex.\nFrom 1949–1951 the Terriers participated in 4 National Catholic Invitational Tournaments (NCIT). The NCIT was a premier post-season tournament in those years. The Terriers went to the NCIT finals three consecutive times and won the Championship in 1951. Lynch's 1950–51 squad defeated the Seattle University Redhawks 93–79 in the Championship game. Ray Rudzinski scored 26 points, Vernon Stokes scored 22 and Roy Reardon scored 21 points in the NCIT Championship that took place in Albany, New York.\nThe Terriers appeared in the 1955 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament, losing in the first round to Quincy University. St. Francis first participated in the NAIA District 31 playoffs to qualify for the tournament, in it they defeated St. Peter's (63–55) and Panzer College (80–70). Their record in the tournament is 0–1 and have only made one appearance in their history.\nLynch also led the Terriers to 3 NIT appearances (1954, 1956, and 1963). Lynch's 1953–54 squad won the Metropolitan New York Conference regular season championship and were invited to the 1954 NIT where they defeated Louisville in the first round before losing to Holy Cross in the Quarterfinals. The 1955–56 squad also won the Metropolitan New York Conference regular season championship and participated in the 1956 NIT. They went as far as the 3rd-place game where they lost to St. Joseph's to finish in fourth place.&lt;ref name=\"NYtimes.com/Sports\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 1955–1956 season was the Terriers best, as Coach Lynch led them to a 21–4 record that ranked them at 13th nationally in the AP polls. The squad included legends Al Innis, Dan Mannix, Walt Adamushko, and Tony D'Elia. The team at one point won 18 straight games and upset Niagara to reach the NIT Semi-Finals, before falling to Dayton. In the 1963 National Invitation Tournament the Terriers were one of 12 teams selected for the tournament. Lynch's team was the 4th best defense in the country and faced the best offense in Miami. St. Francis had the bigger Miami on the ropes with a 66–65 lead with 3:38 to play, led by Jim Raftery who scored 23 points. Yet the Terrires went on to lose 71–70 to Miami which featured future NBA all-star Rick Barry.\nAfter the Metropolitan New York Conference became defunct in 1963, the Terriers became Independents before joining the Metropolitan Collegiate Conference. The Terriers were a part of the MCC for all four years in which it was active, winning the 1966–67 Conference regular season championship after going 7–2 in conference play. Lynch ended his coaching career with a 283-237 (54.4%) record over a 21-year span. After retiring as the head coach, Lynch became the full-time Athletic Director at St. Francis College, a post he held while he was head coach for several years.\nHome court.\nThe Terriers originally played most of their home games in their gymnasium at their Butler Street Campus, this lasted until 1955. The Terriers were also occasionally invited to play at Madison Square Garden III by Ned Irish, a basketball promoter. Yet, beginning in the late 1940s the Terriers would also host games at the 14th Regiment Armory in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Starting in the 1950-51 season, St. Francis College was banned from the Garden by Ned Irish for scheduling marquee games at the Park Slope Armory.\nBy 1956, the Terriers were exclusively hosting games at the Park Slope Armory since the College was in the process of moving its campus from Butler Street to the current Remsen Street location in Brooklyn Heights. The Terriers practices were often interrupted by military drills, and in 1960 the Terriers decided to relocate to the 69th Regiment Armory in Manhattan. The 69th Regiment Armory also provided a larger venue for the Terriers. Occasionally their games could not be played there, again because of military drills, as an alternate the Terriers would host games at Bishop Ford High School in Brooklyn. By 1968, the plans for a new gymnasium of their own at the Remsen Street Campus was in progress. Daniel Lynch was a large proponent of the Terriers having their own basketball court, and by 1971 the Terriers finally had their own gymnasium. The building is referred to as the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex and the basketball gym is named after Daniel Lynch.\nWith SFC noticeably expanding its enrollment in the early 2020s, it outgrew its Remsen Street campus, and moved to a new campus on Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn after the 2021–22 school year. The new campus lacks athletic facilities, forcing SFC to move basketball elsewhere. For the immediate future, the Terriers will play at The ARC at Pratt Institute, about 2 miles (3 km) from SFC's new campus in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill neighborhood.\nDark years (1969–90).\nFrom the 1969–70 season to the 1990–91 season, a span of 22 years, the St. Francis Terriers men's basketball program only had three winning seasons. Two of those came during the tenure of Lou Rossini, who was formerly a head coach for NYU and Columbia. In the third year of his contract with St. Francis College, it was announced that they would not renew his contract. His team's performance on the court was not the reason and it is believed that differences arose because of the subpar academic performance of the student-athletes.\nDuring those 22 years the Terriers went through six head coaches and hit a program low in the 1983–84 season going 2–26. In particular the tenures of Gene Roberti (1979–84) and Bob Valvano (1984–88) saw the program hit all-time lows in winning percentage, during those two tenures the Terriers went 81–166 (32.7%). After Valvano, Rich Zvosec took the reins of the Terriers in 1988 and became the youngest Division I coach in the country at age 27. Zvosec produced a winning season 3 years into his tenure going 15–14. The winning season was only the 3rd in 22 years and the first in 11 seasons since Rossini accomplished the feat in 1978–79. Because of this feat, Zvosec was awarded the 1991 NEC Coach of the Year award.\nAlso during this time St. Francis College moved its campus and in 1971 the Terriers settled into a new home at the Pope Physical Education Center. Other transitions during this time included St. Francis joining a new conference in 1981, the Northeast Conference (then known as the ECAC Metro Conference). From 1968 until 1980, the Terriers played as Division I independents eventually becoming founding members of the Northeast Conference in 1981.\nRon Ganulin era (1991–04).\nRon Ganulin's 14 seasons were one of contrasts, but Ganulin helped restore the program to its glory days somewhat. Before joining the Terriers, Ganulin was fresh off the 1990 National Championship as an assistant with the 1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team. Ganulin's tenure began with several losing seasons, his 1993–94 squad went 1–26 and finished last in the Northeast Conference. Yet by the 1997–98 season Ganulin's squad's began to turn it around stringing together 5 consecutive winning seasons from 1997–2001. Ganulin's 1998–99 team won 20 games, the first time in 43 years that the Terriers had accomplished the feat.\nGanulin accumulated 187 wins and was twice named the Northeast Conference's Coach of the Year. Ganulin's tenure at St. Francis include finishing with a .500 or better record in the Northeast Conference eight straight years, at that time the longest active streak in the conference and making the NEC Tournament each of his 14 seasons as head coach. They also reached the NEC semi-finals five times and had two NEC tournament championship game appearances (2001 and 2003). Those Championship game appearances are the closest the Terriers have been to making the NCAA tournament. From 1998 through 2004, St. Francis posted a 78–36 conference record, which was best in the NEC. During that span, Ganulin guided the Terriers to two Northeast Conference regular season championships.\nAlso during Ganulin's tenure St. Francis made their first appearance in a National Tournament since 1963, by being selected to participate in the 2003 NIT Season Tip-Off. The Terriers lost in the first round to Massachusetts. The 2003 NIT Tip-off invitation was a product of the Terriers success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet Ganulin's accomplishments did not save him from being fired at the end of the 2004–05 season, after posting a 13–15 record.\nBrian Nash era (2005–09).\nBrian Nash was head coach for 5 seasons, during which time the Terriers lost much of the momentum gained during Ganulin's tenure. Nash's squad's never produced a winning season and missed the NEC Tournament three times in five seasons. Nash compiled a 47–99 record before resigning in 2009.\nGlenn Braica era (2010–2023).\nOn April 29, 2010, Glenn Braica was announced as the 17th head coach in the history of the St. Francis Terriers men's basketball program. Braica was a former assistant at St. Francis under Ron Ganulin for 15 years and was an assistant at St. John's under Norm Roberts for another 6 years.\nBraica inherited a depleted team that had not had a winning season in six years and quickly added 5 signings in his first year. This led to a 15–15 record and a berth in the NEC Tournament where they lost in the first round to Central Connecticut 62–64. In his second season, Braica led the Terriers to their second NEC tournament with the 4th seed. They went 15–15 overall and 12–6 in the NEC, their most conference wins since the 2003–04 season and they hosted their first home tournament game since 1997, a 72–80 loss to Quinnipiac. Additionally, Braica was selected as the 2012 NEC Jim Phelan coach of the year and as the 2012 NABC District 18 Co-Coach of the Year. After two 15–15 seasons, the Terriers posted their first losing record at 12–18 overall and 8–10 in conference play. St. Francis Brooklyn still qualified for the NEC tournament with the 8th seed and lost to first seed Robert Morris at the Sewall Center 57–75 in the opening round.\nPrior to the 2013 season, Braica announced that he hired former head coach Ron Ganulin as an assistant. This would be their second stint together, but with Briaca at the helm this time. In 2013, the Terriers were selected to participate in the Maui Invitational Tournament as part of the Mainland Bracket for the first time in the programs history. Braica was able to guide his Terriers to a 9–6 non-conference record which was one win shy of being the first NEC team to win 10 non-conference games in a season. Part of this success was the Terriers stingy defense and big road wins against Miami, Florida Atlantic and Stony Brook. The Terriers ended the 2013–14 season at 18–14, their first time winning 18 games since the 2001–02 season. The Terriers qualified for the NEC Tournament with the 4th seed and lost to Mount St. Mary's in the opening round.\nThe 2014–15 Terriers for the first time as members of the NEC, were selected as the preseason NEC favorites by league head coaches. The program was also selected to participate in the 3rd annual 2014 Barclays Center Classic. On January 31, 2015, the Terriers gained sole possession of 1st place in the NEC after defeating LIU Brooklyn in the annual Battle of Brooklyn. For St. Francis Brooklyn, it marks being in first place after 10 games since starting 8–2 in the 2003–04 season. That year the Terriers finished 12–6 and shared the NEC regular season title with Monmouth. On February 21, 2015 the Terriers clinched the NEC regular season Championship and recorded their first 20+ win season since the 1998–99 season. The Terriers closed out the regular season at 21–10 overall and 15–3 in conference play. Prior to the beginning of the NEC Tournament, the NEC announced Glenn Braica as the Jim Phelan Coach of the Year, Jalen Cannon as the NEC Player of the Year and Amdy Fall as the NEC Defensive Player of the Year. In the NEC Tournament, the Terriers defeated LIU Brooklyn and Saint Francis (PA) to reach the Championship game, where they lost to Robert Morris. Because of the loss the Terriers didn't receive the NEC's automatic NCAA bid, instead they participated in the 2015 National Invitation Tournament by virtue of having won the NEC regular season championship. It is the programs first NIT postseason appearance since 1963. The Terriers traveled to Richmond, Virginia to face the Spiders and lost 74–84 in the first round of the NIT. The Terriers ended their season at 23–12 overall, tying the programs record for wins in a season last set in 1953–54.\nFrom 2015-2017, the Terriers posted three consecutive losing seasons and in the 2016–17 season the Terriers failed to reach the NEC Tournament for the first time in Braica's tenure as head coach. For the 2018-19 season, the Terriers posted a winning record (17–15) and although they were eliminated in the opening round of the 2019 NEC tournament, they were selected to participate in the 2019 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. It is the first time the Terriers have been selected to participate in the CIT.\nTermination of intercollegiate athletics (2023).\nWith the announcement that St. Francis would end sponsorship of intercollegiate athletics, the Terriers' 2022-23 season would be their last. The college cited financial and enrollment concerns stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason behind its decision.\nYearly record.\nUnder Glenn Braica:\nPostseason.\nNCIT results.\nSt. Francis participated in 4 consecutive National Catholic Invitational Tournaments from 1949 to 1952 and won 1 Championship in 1951. Their overall record is 10–3 in their 4 appearances and they made the Finals in three of their four appearances.\nNAIA results.\nThe Terriers appeared in the 1955 NAIA men's basketball tournament. St. Francis first participated in the NAIA District 31 playoffs to qualify for the tournament, where they defeated Saint Peter's (63–55) and Panzer College (80–70). Their record in the tournament is 0–1 and have only made one appearance in their history.\nNIT results.\nThe Terriers have appeared in four National Invitation Tournaments and one NIT Season Tip-Off. Their combined record is 3–5 (0–1, Tip-Off) and they reached the third-place game in 1956, losing to Saint Joseph's and finishing 4th in the tournament. In the 1963 National Invitation Tournament the Terriers were one of 12 teams selected for the tournament. The Terriers who were coached by Daniel Lynch were the 4th best defense in the country and faced the best offense in Miami. St. Francis had the bigger Miami on the ropes with a 66–65 lead with 3:38 to play, led by Jim Raftery who scored 23 points. Yet the Terrires went on to lose 71–70 to Miami which featured future NBA all-star Rick Barry.\nCIT results.\nThe Terriers appeared in their only CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament in 2019 under head coach Glenn Braica. In the 2019 tournament, St. Francis Brooklyn faced Hampton, their first game against each other in history. The Terriers lost to Hampton 72–81 in the opening round of the CIT.\nRivalry.\nThe fiercest rival of the Terriers are the Long Island University Blackbirds and they have competed since 1928. Beginning in the 1975–76 season the two programs formalized their rivalry with the annual \"Battle of Brooklyn\" game. The name of the annual match-up is in reference to the first major battle of the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Brooklyn. The location of the two campuses in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and their close proximity, less than 1 mile apart, adds to the intensity of the rivalry and is the origin of the rivalry's name. The \"Battle of Brooklyn\" is dedicated to William Lai and Daniel Lynch, former athletic directors at Long Island University and St. Francis College, respectively. At the conclusion of the game the most valuable player is presented with the Lai-Lynch Trophy. As of 2020, St. Francis has a \"Battle\" record of 20–25 against LIU. The annual tournament is held at the host campus and the host alternates annually.\nThe Terriers also compete against Wagner College Seahawks, and it is referred to as \"Battle of the Verrazano\" due to St. Francis College in Brooklyn being separated from Wagner College in Staten Island by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The \"Battle of the Verrazano\" dates back to the 1973–1974 season, but is not as formal as the \"Battle of Brooklyn\".\nThe Terriers also have a rivalry with St. John's University men's basketball program. The Terriers played against St. John's in their inaugural season, 1907, losing to them 12–23. There are published accounts of the Terriers stealing the St. John's mascot. One such instance occurred on March 10, 1941, after a game at Madison Square Garden that saw the Terriers defeat St. John's 55-41. The St. John's mascot was kidnapped and a ransom note was sent, eventually the mascot was recovered.\n Traditionally, the most valuable player of the game was awarded the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) trophy.\nTerrier records.\nGreg Nunn (1997–01) was the first player in the program to record 500 points and 500 assists then Brent Jones (2011–15) joined him in 2015 and soon exceeded him by becoming the first player to record 1,000 points and 500 assists. That same year Jalen Cannon became the first Terrier to record 1,500 points and 1,000 rebounds. Cannon then became the Northeast Conference all-time leader in rebounds by surpassing 1,033 and the St. Francis Brooklyn all-time scorer by surpassing 1,633 points. Cannon finished with 1,720 points and 1,159 rebounds.\nNCAA records.\nNotable records include Vernon Stokes leading the country in field goal percentage with 59.5% shooting during the 1952–53 season. Ray Minlends 1998–99 record for points in a season was also second in the country that year behind Alvin Young's (Niagara) 728. Ron Arnold's record for steals in a game is the 3rd highest in NCAA history- the record is 13 and he had 11 against Mount St. Mary's. In 1991, Lester James recorded a 69.3% field goal percentage, which is tied for 21st all-time. Jim Paguaga's 120 steals in 1986 is tied for 16th all-time and his steal average that season, 4.29, is 8th all-time.\nTerriers in professional leagues.\nNBA.\nThere has been a total of 11 Terriers drafted by NBA teams.\nRetired numbers.\nThe St. Francis Brooklyn men's basketball program has honored only two former players, Denis McDermott and Alvin Inniss, by retiring their numbers. McDermott was the first Terrier to have his number retired. He graduated as the career leading scorer (fourth all-time as of 2019–20) in the programs history and was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1974. McDermott also has the program's highest scoring average at 21.3 points per game over 74 career games. In his senior year, McDermott averaged a double-double per game with 23.8 points and 10.8 rebounds. The second Terrier to have his number retired was Alvin Inniss, on February 1, 2020. Innis played from 1954–58, his teams compiled a 64–35 record and participated in the 1955 NAIA men's basketball tournament and the 1956 National Invitation Tournament. Prior to McDermott becoming the career leading scorer, Innis held the title with 1,503 points. Innis continues to be the Terriers' all-time leading rebounder with 1,667 career rebounds."

        "text": "John Ramage (born February 7, 1991) is a Canadian born-American professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for Grizzlys Wolfsburg of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Ramage was a fourth-round selection of the Calgary Flames (103rd overall) at the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.\nRamage played four seasons of college hockey with the University of Wisconsin Badgers and has twice won a medal as a member of the American junior national team: Gold at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, and bronze as captain of the American junior national team that won the bronze medal at the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He turned professional in 2013 and made his NHL debut in 2015.\nEarly life.\nRamage was born in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, Ontario, when his father, former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rob Ramage, was a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs, but was raised in the St. Louis area suburb of Chesterfield, Missouri. He is the son of Rob and his wife Dawn, and has two elder sisters, Tamara and Jacklyn. \nAs a youth, Ramage played in the 2004 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Louis Blues minor ice hockey team. Ramage followed his father into hockey and played for his hometown St. Louis Bandits in the North American Hockey League (NAHL) in 2007–08 before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (USNTDP) for a year. While a member of the program, Ramage represented Team USA at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships and recorded one assist in seven games for the gold medal-winning squad.\nAt least four National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools attempted to recruit Ramage, as did the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Ramage accepted a scholarship offer to attend the University of Wisconsin and play with the Wisconsin Badgers hockey team beginning in the 2009–10 season. At Wisconsin, Ramage majored in life sciences communication and completed his four-year degree.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nRamage played four seasons with the Badgers between 2009 and 2013. As a freshman in 2009–10, he scored 2 goals and added 10 assists in 41 games. He also joined the United States junior national team for the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Ramage recorded three assists in seven games and the Americans defeated the host Canadians in the final to win the gold medal. Ramage played in his second World Junior Championship in 2011; he served as team captain for the bronze medal-winning Americans.\nAt the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Ramage was selected in the fourth round, 103rd overall, by the Calgary Flames – one of his father's former teams. He remained at Wisconsin, and in his sophomore season of 2010–11, scored 1 goal and added 10 assists. Named the Badger's captain in his junior season of 2011–12, Ramage initially struggled and finished with only 10 points in 37 games. Wanting to complete his degree and to continue to develop as a player, Ramage declined an opportunity to turn professional with the Flames and instead returned to Wisconsin for his senior season. Ramage enjoyed his best collegiate season in 2012–13 as he tallied 8 goals and 12 assists for 20 points in 42 games. In 157 games over four years, he scored 14 goals and 53 points.\nProfessional.\nUpon completing his college career, Ramage signed a two-year contract with the Calgary Flames. He began the 2013–14 season with Calgary's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat, where he recorded only 1 assist in 50 games. The Flames demoted him to the ECHL's Alaska Aces, a development that Ramage later said benefited him as he received increased responsibilities with Alaska. He appeared in the team's final six regular season games, during which he recorded one goal. He then added 4 more goals and 13 assists in 20 playoff games as the Aces won the Kelly Cup championship.\nReturning to the AHL for the 2014–15 season, Ramage was assigned to Calgary's relocated affiliate, the Adirondack Flames. He recorded 14 points with the team in 53 games before earning his first NHL recall on April 10, 2015. He made his NHL debut the following day in a 5–1 loss to the Winnipeg Jets. Following the season, the Flames chose not to extend a qualifying offer to Ramage on a new contract, thus making him an unrestricted free agent. On July 3, 2015, Ramage signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He contributed to the Lake Erie Monsters Calder Cup championship for the 2015–16 season.\nDuring his third season within the Blue Jackets organization in the 2017–18 campaign, Ramage was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for future considerations on January 22, 2018. On February 26, 2018, the Coyotes traded Ramage along with Tyler Gaudet to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Pierre-Cédric Labrie and Trevor Murphy. He was immediately assigned to the Predators AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, adding 3 assists in 21 games.\nOn July 1, 2018, Ramage continued his journeyman career, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract with the New Jersey Devils. Ramage was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Devils for the duration of the 2018–19 season. In his sixth season in the AHL, Ramage established new career best markers with 12 goals and 31 points in 74 games, however was unable to earn a recall to New Jersey.\nAs an impending free agent, Ramage opted to pursue a European career, signing his first contract abroad on a two-year agreement with German club, Eisbären Berlin of the DEL, on May 10, 2019.\nAfter helping Berlin claim their eighth championship title in his second season with the club, Ramage left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with Schwenninger Wild Wings on May 14, 2021.\nRamage would spend two seasons with the Wild Wings, captaining the club for the 2022–23 season in which he appeared in every regular season game with the Wild Wings, collecting 4 goals and 22 points. Unable to help Schwenninger advance to the post-season, it was announced Ramage would leave the club at the conclusion of his contract on March 9, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Emily Ramage (née Butrym) on July 11, 2015 in Libertyville, Illinois.\nNotes.\n Sources disagree on where Ramage was born. The National Hockey League's website says Mississauga, Ontario, however the Calgary Flames Media Guide, the IIHF Guide and Record Book, \"Winnipeg Free Press\", and Canadian Press all give St. Louis. John's father Rob was playing with the Toronto Maple Leafs at the time of his birth, but had previously spent six seasons in St. Louis."

Discipline at the 2003 event could be said to be the best out of all seven tournaments to date, at least in terms of red cards, as none were issued. Nine countries have seen at least one of their players dismissed, with Tonga and Canada both having lost three members of their team. The position with the most red cards is flanker, with eight such players leaving the field. Four team captains have been dismissed by the referee. There has only been one red card to date for two yellow card offenses, and only one red card in a World Cup final (in 2023).\nDetails.\nThe first player to receive a red card was Welsh lock Huw Richards in the inaugural Rugby World Cup. Richards punched New Zealand lock Gary Whetton and received a one-week suspension for his actions. He therefore missed the final match of the team's World Cup – the third place playoff against Australia. In that match Australian flanker David Codey was sent off in the fifth minute, which at the time was the quickest dismissal in any Rugby World Cup. match Warned after only one minute, Codey again trampled on a Welsh player in a ruck and was told to leave the field. The game continued and Australia lost by a point.\nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup saw two locks from opposing teams shown the red card. Highly regarded Argentine Pedro Sporleder, who would go on to compete in the next three tournaments, fought with Samoan Mat Keenan and both were sent from the field.\nFour players were sent off during the 1995 Rugby World Cup with three of them being dismissed in one incident. Electrical problems at the Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth caused the South Africa–Canada match to be postponed by 45 minutes, adding to the tension of the last, decisive Pool A game. With 10 minutes left the South Africans were leading 20–0 when a challenge by Pieter Hendriks on Canadian Winston Stanley sparked a fight between the two teams. Fullback Scott Stewart charged into Hendriks and was joined by Springbok hooker James Dalton and several others. Referee David McHugh chose to send off Dalton as well as Canadians Rod Snow and Gareth Rees, the captain. Investigations after the match led to Hendriks and Stewart being suspended. One week earlier Tongan flanker Feleti Mahoni was caught stamping on the head of Frenchman Philippe Benetton during a ruck, resulting in an immediate dismissal and a lengthy ban. Until that point Tonga had been making impressive progress against a French team that had been tipped to win the tournament.\nThe 1999 Rugby World Cup also saw four players dismissed but this time in four matches and from four teams. The first red card went to Marika Vunibaka who had scored a try and in doing so became the only player to have been sent off after scoring points. Dismissed in injury time at the end of the second half, the Fijian was adjudged to have head-butted a Canadian player. Canadian flanker Dan Baugh was sent off for stamping on a Namibian player and subsequently received a four-week ban. Ngalu Taufo'ou was sanctioned in the same way after running ten metres to punch England flanker Richard Hill. On the same day Brendan Venter was sent off for stamping on Uruguayan Martín Panizza.\nUnique amongst the seven tournaments, no players were sent off during the 48 games of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.\nTwo players were shown red cards for two teams at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, both on the same day. Tongan Hale T-Pole was dismissed in the final ten minutes of the match against Samoa when he elbowed substitute Leo Lafaiali'i in the face. He had received several warnings from the referee prior to the incident. Namibian Jacques Nieuwenhuis received his red card after a dangerous tackle on Frenchman Sébastien Chabal. The resultant enquiry decided that Nieuwenhuis had recklessly but not intentionally tackled Chabal around the head and gave him a one match ban.\nTwo players were sent off during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Samoa's Paul Williams was reprimanded for striking a South African player but escaped a ban when it was deemed that his actions were not heavy, had no adverse effect on the game, and that there were \"compelling on-field and/or off-field aggravating features\". Wales captain Sam Warburton was sent off in the semi-final against France because he did not safely return a player to the floor after a tackle. The decision was controversial with several commentators believing that it should only be a yellow card because Warburton did not drive the player into the ground. Austin Healey was one of several current and former players who criticised the dismissal on Twitter, calling it a \"most ridiculous decision\". However, the red card was upheld after the match and Warburton was given a three-week ban. Warburton became only the second player to be dismissed in a semi-final. Coincidentally, the other player, Huw Richards, was also representing Wales.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground was a cricket field in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ground, located in the Palermo district and property of Buenos Aires Cricket Club, gained historic relevance because the first football (in 1867) and rugby union (in 1873) matches in Argentina were played there.\nHistory.\nThe football match disputed in the BACC was such a success that some members would go on to found the Buenos Aires Football Club, which would be the first football club in South America. For years to come both clubs would share installations and members with BACC playing cricket in summer and BAFC playing football in winter.\nThe first recorded cricket match on the ground came in 1891 when the North of Argentina played the South of Argentina.\nThe ground later held its first first-class match in 1912 when Argentina national team played the touring Marylebone Cricket Club, resulting in a 210 run victory for the tourists. The second first-class match held on the ground came in 1927 in a repeat of the 1912 fixture, which this time resulted in an Argentine victory by 29 runs. The last recorded match came in March 1947 between the Argentine Cricket Association Colts North and Argentine Cricket Association Colts South. In 1951, after much of the club had been destroyed in a fire which also destroyed its archives three years before, Buenos Aires Cricket Club merged with Buenos Aires Football Club to form the Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club and the club built its new cricket field in the San Fernando district of Greater Buenos Aires."

He played for Newcastle NYC team in 2011. At the end of the 2011 season, Anderson was named the Newcastle club's NYC Player of the Year and the Players' Player of the Year.\nIn October 2011, Anderson was forced to decide on whether to sign with the Penrith Panthers or re-sign with Newcastle. Phil Gould, the coaching director of the Panthers, offered an easier path to first-grade football with the loss of prop Petero Civoniceva. However, Wayne Bennett, the coach of the Newcastle club, personally told Anderson that he was in his future plans for Newcastle.\nOn 21 October 2011, Anderson re-signed with Newcastle on a one-year contract.\nIn September 2012, Anderson signed a one-year contract with the Penrith Panthers starting in 2013 after failing to make first-grade with Newcastle in 2012.\nIn Round 9 of the 2013 NRL season, Anderson made his NRL debut for the Penrith club against the Melbourne Storm.\nOn 17 July 2013, Anderson played for the New South Wales Residents against the Queensland Residents.\nOn 22 September 2013, Anderson was named on the interchange bench in the 2013 New South Wales Cup Team of the Year.\nIn October he was also named as Penrith's New South Wales Cup Player of the Year, so capped off a very successful 2013.\nOn 9 July 2014, Anderson again played for the New South Wales Residents against the Queensland Residents.\nOn 21 September 2014, Anderson was named on the interchange bench in the 2014 New South Wales Cup Team of the Year for the second year in a row.\nOn 3 May 2015, Anderson played for the New South Wales Residents against the Queensland Residents for the third year in a row.

A native of Carbondale, Illinois, Taylor starred at Carbondale Community High School in basketball before enrolling at Murray State. He was named an All-American, and at the time of his decision to attend Murray State he was one of the most highly sought-after recruits the school had ever signed.\nDuring Taylor's first season in 1969–70, NCAA rules prohibited freshmen from playing on their colleges' varsity sports teams, so Taylor played for Murray State's freshman squad and averaged 22.4 points per game. When he became eligible as a sophomore in 1970–71, the 6'3\" small forward averaged 15.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game en route to his first of three consecutive All-Ohio Valley Conference First Team honors. He was also named the conference's Sophomore of the Year. During Taylor's junior season, he averaged a still-standing school record 25.6 points per game (good for eighth in the nation) and twice scored 39 points in a single game. He was named the Evansville Holiday Tournament MVP, and at the end of the season was declared the Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In his final season, Taylor led the team in scoring and assists per game with averaged of 22.4 and 3.3, respectively. He earned his second consecutive conference player of the year honor as well.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers selected him in the ninth round (142nd overall) in the 1973 NBA draft. In the 1973 ABA Draft, the Kentucky Colonels chose him in the seventh round. Despite getting drafted into two different basketball leagues, he played in neither. Taylor was inducted into the Murray State University Hall of Fame in 1987."

        "text": "Dan Anders Eriksson (born March 17, 1985) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward. He is currently an unrestricted free agent having last played with Lausitzer Füchse in the DEL2 in Germany.\nPlaying career.\nEriksson was born in Floda, Sweden, but grew up in Gothenburg with Frölunda HC as his youth team. As a 19-year-old, he signed with Borås HC of the Swedish Division 1, the third tier in Swedish senior ice hockey, for his first professional contract with a senior team. With 21 goals and 41 points in 42 games with the team in the 2006–07 season, Eriksson was a significant factor for Borås HC reaching the 2007 HockeyAllsvenskan Kvalserien that season. In the 2007 Kvalserien he scored 5 goals and 8 points in 8 games; Borås finished second in the 2007 Kvalserien and promoted to the HockeyAllsvenskan, the second-tier league, for the 2007–08 season. Anders Eriksson continued to play for the team for three seasons and was a good reason why Borås managed to stay in the HockeyAllsvenskan. His last season with the team ended with 14 goals and 28 points in 51 games.\nVäxjö Lakers in the same league, intending to reach the Kvalserien qualification for the top-tier league Elitserien (SEL) for the third consecutive year, signed Anders Eriksson prior to the 2010–11 season. In the regular season, he scored 12 goals and 33 points for the team, which won the HockeyAllsvenskan for the first time in the club's history and successfully moved on to play in the 2011 Kvalserien. Eriksson's major breakthrough came there. A significant contributor to the Lakers' promotion to the Elitserien, he finished fourth in the scoring league, with 7 goals and 11 points in 10 games. Four of his goals were game-winning ones (GWG's), winning the GWG league.\nAnders Eriksson played his first Elitserien game on September 13, 2011, against Frölunda HC. He did not manage to score any points as Frölunda shutout the Lakers 2–0.\nAfter four seasons with Örebro HK and establishing himself in the SHL, Eriksson left the club as a free agent to try-out with Färjestad BK for the 2016–17 season. On September 11, 2016 he was released from his try-out with FBK and returned to train with Örebro HK. On September 26, 2016 was re-signed to a temporary seven week contract to cover for initial injuries on the Örebro HK roster."

        "text": "Edward L. Warner (July 5, 1929 – September 7, 2002) was an American college basketball player. He was one of the stars of the 1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team, the only team to win both the NCAA tournament and the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in the same year. He was also a central figure in the point shaving scandal that came to light in the aftermath of that season.\nCollege career.\nWarner came from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx to play college basketball for Nat Holman at the City College of New York. A 6'3\" forward, he regularly battled with bigger men to average 14.8 points per game as a sophomore for the Beavers during their championship year. In the 1950 NIT, he upped this average to 21.7 per game and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player as CCNY defeated Bradley in the final at Madison Square Garden. A couple of weeks later, the Beavers again beat Bradley, this time in the 1950 NCAA tournament, to become the only team to win both tournaments in the same year.\nPoint shaving scandal.\nThe next season, Warner and teammate Ed Roman were named co-captains for the Beavers and were poised to defend their championship titles. On February 18, 1951, New York City District Attorney Frank Hogan arrested seven men for point shaving, including Warner. While most convicted players received suspended sentences, he was sent to prison for six months. A lawyer in the case remarked:\n\"(Judge Saul) Streit considered Warner to be incorrigible and uncontrollable. Warner was too flamboyant and he also had a record as a juvenile delinquent. Streit believed in rehabilitation by deprivation\"\nFor his involvement in fixing games, Warner was permanently banned from playing in the National Basketball Association.\nEBA, prison, high school, paralysis and death.\nAfter serving his sentence at Rikers Island prison, Warner played several years in the Eastern Basketball Association. In the 1960s, he was again imprisoned, for attempting to sell heroin. He then officiated high school basketball games until he was partly paralyzed in a 1984 car accident. He died on September 7, 2002."

        "title": "Baseball metaphors for sex",
        "text": "In American slang, baseball metaphors for sex are often used as euphemisms for the degree of physical intimacy achieved in sexual encounters or relationships. In the metaphor, first prevalent in the aftermath of World War II, sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of baseball. Baseball has also served as the context for metaphors about sexual roles and identity.\nRunning the bases.\nAmong the most commonly used metaphors is the progress of a batter and base-runner in describing levels of physical intimacy (traditionally from a heterosexual perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of the terms:\nThe metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one well-known example in the Meat Loaf song \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\", which describes a young couple \"making out\", with a voice-over commentary of a portion of a baseball game, as a metaphor for the couple's activities. A similar example can be found in Billy Joel's song \"Zanzibar\" in which he compares himself to Pete Rose and sings the lines, \"Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd steal it if she only gave the sign. She's gonna give the go ahead, the inning isn't over yet for me.\" Trace Adkins's 2006 song \"Swing\" is based on the same concept while the protagonist in Brad Paisley's 2007 song \"Online\" is described as having never been to second base with a woman.\nBaseball positions are used as a coded reference to the roles played by men who have sex with men:\nSimilar metaphors for sexual identity include:\nViews.\nThe sequence of \"running the bases\" is often regarded as a script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on safe sex to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the \"home run\" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and Rissel conversely state that \"third base\" is now sometimes considered to comprise oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor to \"full\" (i.e. penetrative) sex. The use of baseball as a sexual script in general, regardless of what each base signifies, has been critiqued by sexuality educators for misrepresenting sex as a contest with a winner and loser. Deborah Roffman writes that the baseball metaphor has been \"insidiously powerful, singularly effective, and very efficient...as a vehicle for transmitting and transferring to successive generations of young people all that is wrong and unhealthy about American sexual attitudes.\"\nThere are conflicting perspectives on the use of the baseball metaphor as a part of sex education. Some educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective instructional tool when providing sex education to middle school students. Supporters of baseball metaphors in sex education include Leman and Bell. In their book \"A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex\", they use a baseball metaphor to aid parents in the discussion of puberty with their children, dividing the topics into \"first base\" (\"Changes from the neck up\"), \"second base\" (\"Changes from the neck to the waist\"), \"third base\" (\"Changes from the waist down\"), and \"home plate\" (\"The Big 'It). Others argue that the baseball metaphor reflects U.S. ideas about sex as a contest to be won, rather than a mutual and consensual activity. These critiques suggest that other metaphors might be more useful for explaining sexual consent and pleasure. A critique of the baseball metaphor is offered in sex education material provided by Scarleteen, which gives an example of \"sharing a pizza\" as an alternative metaphor that emphasises mutual appetite and enjoyment over completion."

The Hoosiers then defeated San Diego State Aztecs in the first round of the NCAA tournament before losing to the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the second round. That game would end the season for the Hoosiers, and be the final game at IU for Mike Davis. Coach Davis resigned at the end of the season and in April he accepted the head coaching position at UAB.

        "text": "The 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship was the inaugural running of the World Endurance Championship. It was co-organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series replaced the former Intercontinental Le Mans Cup held by the ACO from 2010 to 2011. The series was open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-based racing cars meeting four ACO categories. Several championships, cups, and trophies were awarded in the series' four categories following an eight race season, with a World Championship available to the top scoring drivers and LMP1 category manufacturer.\nFollowing a partial-season match-up against newcomers Toyota, Audi won the Manufacturers' World Championship, while the company's driver line-up of André Lotterer of Germany, Benoît Tréluyer of France, and Marcel Fässler of Switzerland earned the Drivers' World Championship ahead of their teammates Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen. Toyota's Alexander Wurz and Nicolas Lapierre were third in the Drivers' Championship standings. Ferrari defending their two Intercontinental Le Mans Cup LMGTE manufacturers title with the Manufacturers' World Cup, outscoring Porsche and Corvette. In the four FIA Trophies for the four categories in the championship, Rebellion Racing won the LMP1 Privateers title, while Starworks Motorsport secured the LMP2 championship; AF Corse won the LMGTE Pro category for the second season in a row, as did Larbre Compétition in LMGTE Am.\nCalendar.\nAn initial calendar was announced on 12 November 2011, featuring eight races in eight countries on four continents. Sebring, Spa-Francorchamps, Le Mans, and Silverstone are retained from the 2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, while the Chinese round remained undecided between 2011's Zhuhai International Circuit or the Shanghai International Circuit. Three new races at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, Bahrain International Circuit, and Fuji Speedway expand the series to a new continent, replacing the former ILMC round for the Petit Le Mans. A revised calendar released on 7 December swapped the dates of the events in Bahrain and Fuji, while ACO confirmed on 2 February that the final round would be hosted in Shanghai, with the date moved to 27 October. All races were timed events. The 12 Hours of Sebring was a joint event with competitors from the American Le Mans Series sharing half of the race grid, but not scoring points in the World Championship.\nEntries.\nThe World Endurance Championship received entries in four classes, including Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1), Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2), Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance — Professional (LMGTE Pro) and Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance — Amateur (LMGTE Am). The entry list for the 2012 season was released by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest on 2 February, and included nine LMP1 and LMP2 cars, five LMGTE Pro entries, and seven LMGTE Am cars, bringing the full grid up to thirty entrants. Additional entries from full-season teams were also allowed over the course of the season, with a maximum of three cars per entrant.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nChampionships.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point was awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car in qualifying in each category. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the points allocation was doubled.\nDrivers' World Championship.\nAndré Lotterer, Benoît Tréluyer and Marcel Fässler won the Drivers' World Championship at the 6 Hours of Shanghai. They had won three races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans driving the No.1 car of Audi Sport Team Joest.\nManufacturers' World Championship.\nThe FIA LMP1 Manufacturers' World Endurance Championship was open to full-season manufacturer entries participating in the LMP1 category. Points were only awarded to the highest scoring entry for that manufacturer for each event. Further, only the scores from six events counted towards the championship, Le Mans plus the five best race results over the season. Audi secured the Manufacturers' World Championship at the 6 Hours of Silverstone following four consecutive victories in the first half of the championship.\nManufacturers' World Cup.\nThe LMGTE Manufacturers' World Cup was open to full-season manufacturer entries participating in either of the two LMGTE categories. Results in the LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am categories were combined for the World Cup. Only the two best classified cars of the same manufacturer in an event scored points for the World Cup. Ferrari secured the Manufacturers' World Cup title at the 6 Hours of Bahrain following four consecutive victories.\nLMP1 Trophy.\nThe FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP1 Teams was open to full-season privateer LMP1 entries not designated as manufacturers. Only the best classified car of a team at each event scored points for the Trophy. Rebellion Racing secured the LMP1 Trophy at the 6 Hours of Fuji, winning five of the first seven races in the season including five races with both team cars on the privateer podium.\nLMP2 Trophy.\nStarworks Motorsport earned the LMP2 Trophy at the 6 Hours of Fuji, winning three races and earning four class pole positions.\nLMGTE Pro Trophy.\nThe LMGTE Pro Trophy was won by AF Corse, who secured the championship at the 6 Hours of Bahrain.

        "text": "Thomas Larkin (born 31 December 1990) is a British-born Italian ice hockey defenceman. He is currently playing with Schwenninger Wild Wings of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Larkin was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 5th round (137th overall) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, the first Italian-trained player ever selected in the NHL Entry Draft. Larkin attended Phillips Exeter Academy and then spent four years at Colgate University, where he played for the Raiders ice hockey team, and served as the team's co-captain during his senior season. Internationally, Larkin has represented Italy at the world championships.\nPlaying career.\nIn Larkin's final season at Phillips Exeter Academy he set a school record for most goals and assists by a defenceman in one season (14 and 38, respectively). He also had the school record for most career points by a defenceman (82). Prior to the 2009 NHL Entry Draft Larkin was ranked 87th overall amongst North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. This was an improvement of 59 spots from his place three months prior. He was selected in the fifth round, 137th overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets, becoming the first Italian-trained player ever chosen in the NHL Entry Draft.\nLarkin had an impressive freshman season at Colgate University, playing in 33 games and registering 19 points with 32 minutes in penalties, but his production fell to just 11 points in 41 games played during his sophomore 2010–11 season. Upon completion of his collegiate career, on 5 July 2013, Larkin was signed to a two-year entry level contract by the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nAt the conclusion of his entry-level contract with the Blue Jackets, Larkin was not tendered a new offer and was released to free agency. On 22 August 2015, Larkin signed his first professional European contract, agreeing to a one-year contract with Croatian KHL participants Medveščak Zagreb. He eventually played for the Zagreb team until 16 February 2017 and then was picked up by Adler Mannheim of the German DEL.\nOn 7 November 2017, Larkin hit Daniel Paille during a match between Swedish club Brynas and Adler Mannheim, resulting in Paille leaving with a severe concussion. Two days after the incident, Larkin apologized on Twitter, writing:\n\"It wasn’t my intention to cause an injury. I wanted to put pressure on the puck carrier behind the net. I would like to apologize to Daniel Paille and I hope he is back playing soon.\"\nA year later on 29 November 2018, Swedish prosecutor Joakim Johansson indicated that Larkin would be charged with assault for blindsiding Paille.Larkin was later acquitted of both the criminal charges and the civil case. Paille was ordered to pay Larkin's legal costs as well as those of Adler Mannheim, which totalled just over $400,000 USD. \nIn the 2018-19 campaign, Larkin captured the German championship with Mannheim, scoring the game winner in overtime of game five in the finals against Munich.\nLarkin played seven seasons with Adler Mannheim before leaving as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with Schwenninger Wild Wings of the DEL on 16 April, 2023. \nInternational play.\nLarkin competed at the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division I, 2012 IIHF World Championship and 2014 IIHF World Championship as a member of the Italy national ice hockey team.\nPersonal life.\nLarkin was born in London but grew up in Cocquio-Trevisago, Italy. His father is from Boston, Massachusetts while his mother is from Milan, Italy. When Larkin was four his family moved to Italy; it was there, at age 7, that he first began to play hockey, joining his older brother at the HC Varese's rink. Larkin speaks five languages (English, Italian, French, Spanish and German)."

        "text": "Every late January–early February since 1950, the National Football League (NFL) hosts the Pro Bowl, its all-star game. Players are selected by the votes of coaches, other players, and fans. As of 2013, the Houston Texans have sent 20 different players to the Pro Bowl since their establishment in 2002 for a total of 37 appearances; Andre Johnson has been invited seven times (although he did not play the fifth time due to an ankle injury), Arian Foster has been invited three times, while Mario Williams, Owen Daniels, Matt Schaub, DeMeco Ryans, Johnathan Joseph, Chris Myers, J. J. Watt, Duane Brown, and Antonio Smith have all been invited twice. Jerome Mathis, Vonta Leach, Gary Walker, Aaron Glenn, Brian Cushing, Wade Smith, Bryan Braman, James Casey, and Danieal Manning have all been selected once, although Cushing decided to skip the Pro Bowl due to various injuries he sustained during the 2009 NFL season.\nThe first Pro Bowl selections from the Houston Texans were during their inaugural year. These were two players acquired in the 2002 NFL Expansion Draft, Walker and Glenn. This was followed two years later by the selection of Johnson, the third-overall pick in the previous year's draft. Their first undrafted player to go to the Pro Bowl was Foster after the 2010 season. Foster has since been selected twice more. The 2013 Pro Bowl roster featured eight Texans, a team record, leading the AFC.\nPro Bowl selections.\nThe list below is of all players who accepted their invitation to the Pro Bowl while on the Houston Texans' starting roster. It includes the player's name, position on the Texans' roster, position on the Pro Bowl depth chart (starter, reserve and alternate) and their regular season statistics while playing at their listed position (i.e., wide receivers who also played cornerback would not have their defensive statistics listed)."

        "title": "List of female Indianapolis 500 drivers",
        "text": "This is a list of female motor racing drivers who have entered an Indianapolis 500 race. Ten women racing drivers have officially entered at least once, with Janet Guthrie being the first. Sarah Fisher has the most career starts with nine, and Danica Patrick has the best result with a third place in 2009. Lyn St. James, Patrick, and Simona de Silvestro have all won the Rookie of the Year Award.\nHistory.\nFemale participation of most sorts at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially disallowed throughout the first several decades of competition. As such, female reporters were not even allowed in the pit area until 1971. At the time, journalist Denise McCluggage was notably one of the first to challenge that antiquated norm.\nA number of female owners/sponsors participated in some capacity throughout the first several decades, and off-the-track duties were common. While not behind the wheel of race cars, women were frequently and routinely performers during the pre-race ceremonies, invited as dignitaries to attend the race, and many were employed by the track, working in the ticket office, motel, and other administrative positions. The first female owner to win the race was Maude \"M.A.\" Yagle, who owned the car of 1929 winner Ray Keech.\nIn 1935, Amelia Earhart was selected to serve as the \"Honorary Referee,\" a ceremonial position for a dignitary at the race. In 1972, Dolly Cole (wife of GM executive Ed Cole), became what is believed to be the first woman ever to ride in the pace car at the start of the race.\nIn 1974, Johnny Rutherford's wife Betty scored for him in his team's pit area. She was perhaps the first driver's wife to spend the entire race in the pits. Rutherford won the race, and Betty's presence drew some media attention, leading many other wives to follow suit in future years.\nPioneers.\nThe first female to arrive at Indianapolis looking to qualify was Janet Guthrie in 1976. However, she fell short on speed and preparation time. She was able to pass her rookie test, but suffered numerous mechanical problems during the month. On the final day of time trials, Guthrie was loaned a back-up car owned by A. J. Foyt. She quickly reached a suitable speed; however, she did not make an attempt to qualify. Guthrie returned to Indy and qualified for the first time in 1977, and made three total starts. She earned a 9th-place finish in 1978 and later revealed she drove with a broken wrist sustained during a charity tennis match earlier that week. During her career, she received a mixed welcome among the competitors and fans, but was mostly viewed in a positive light by the media. Her experiences were at times frustrating, as setbacks and difficulties ranged from engine troubles to the total lack of female restrooms in the garage area at the time.\nIn the early 1980s, Desiré Wilson became the next woman to try to make the race, but she failed to qualify. Lyn St. James entered the 1992 race driving for Dick Simon Racing. Due to a services contract with Ford, St. James was initially relegated to the older, under-powered Cosworth DFX engine, and she had trouble getting up to speed. Later in the month, the team secured a Chevrolet engine, and St. James recorded a qualifying speed of over 220 mph. After starting 27th, she finished in 11th place and was named the Rookie of the Year. Overall, she made seven career starts, qualifying 6th in 1994. St. James never managed to finish in the top ten. In 1997, she was running 9th with eleven laps to go when she was taken out by another car in a crash. St. James entered every year from 1992 to 2000, qualifying each time except 1998–1999.\n21st century.\nIn 2000, two female drivers (St. James and Sarah Fisher) started the race, the first time multiple women qualified for the same race. At least two started every race between 2007 and 2015. Since 2001, seven women (five of them international drivers) have started the 500.\nBefore 2005, Guthrie held the record for best finish in the race. That year, Danica Patrick, made her Indianapolis debut, qualifying 4th. She led 19 laps, finished in 4th place, and was named Rookie of the Year. In 2008, she was the first female winner of an IndyCar race when she won at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan. She bettered her record in 2009, finishing 3rd, and also led laps in the Centennial Race in 2011. As of 2017, she is also the first female driver to have led laps in the Indianapolis 500, the Daytona 500, and the Coca-Cola 600.\nIn 2010, four women (Patrick, Fisher, Ana Beatriz, and Simona de Silvestro) started the race, while a fifth (Milka Duno) failed to qualify. Patrick finished 6th, and de Silvestro received the Rookie of the Year award. Four women also started in 2011, and three of them finished the race. Four women qualified for the 2013 500.\nIn 2020, no female drivers were on the official entry list. It marked the first time since 1999 that there would not be a female driver in the starting lineup. The 2020 race also marked the first time since 1991 that not a single female driver was entered. Pippa Mann, who raced her seventh 500 in 2019, did not enter the 2020 race; because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to secure corporate sponsorship, so lacked the funds needed to sustain an IndyCar season.\nStarting command.\nTraditionally, the starting command for the race has been \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\" When female drivers are competing, the call has been amended to \"Lady and Gentlemen...\" or \"Ladies and Gentlemen...\"\nIn 1977, a controversy hovered over the starting command, after Janet Guthrie qualified for the race. Speedway officials did not want to alter the traditional phrase. After complaints and consideration, on race morning, Tony Hulman recited the following:\nIn 2017 and 2018, Tony George recited the call as \"Drivers, start your engines,\" but reverted to \"Lady and Gentlemen...\" for the 2019 race. In 2020, with no women entered in the race, Roger Penske reverted to \"Drivers, start your engines.\"\nOther notable women at Indianapolis.\nUpon the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, his wife, Mary Fendrich Hulman, became chairman of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. When she retired in 1988, her daughter, Mari Hulman George, took over and held the position until 2016.\nThere have been several female car owners at the Indianapolis 500. The first and only female car owner to win was Maude \"M.A.\" Yagle, who owned the 1929 race winning car for driver Ray Keech. Other notable female owners include Mari Hulman George (who owned the car of husband Elmer George) and former driver Sarah Fisher.\nThe first professional female competition at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was not an automobile race, but the LPGA 500 Ladies Classic in 1968. It was played at the Speedway Golf Course.\nFour women (Mishael Abbott, Cyndie Allemann, Ana Beatriz, and Pippa Mann) have participated in the Freedom 100, a Firestone Indy Lights race held at IMS on the Friday before the 500. Beatriz had a best finish of 5th in 2008, and Mann won the pole for the event in 2010.\nAngela Ashmore was part of Marcus Ericsson's race winning crew at the 2022 Indianapolis 500, as an assistant race engineer. She is believed to be the only female crew member to win the Indianapolis 500.\nTwice, a woman has driven the pace car at the start of the race: Elaine Irwin Mellencamp (2001) and Robin Roberts (2010). Prior to that, in 1972, Dolly Cole (wife of GM executive Ed Cole), rode as a passenger in the pace car. At the time, it was common for celebrities and dignitaries to ride as passengers in the pace car, and Cole is believed to be the first woman ever to do so.\nOnly two female drivers have ever attempted to qualify for NASCAR's Brickyard 400, the other major event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval. In 2001, Shawna Robinson attempted, but failed to qualify. The NASCAR Nationwide Series came to the track for the first time in 2012 with the Indiana 250. Two women (Danica Patrick and Johanna Long) raced in that event. In 2013, Danica Patrick became the first woman to qualify for the Brickyard 400, joining 18 drivers that have competed in both the \"500\" and \"400.\"\nFemale owners/teams.\n\"Partial list\""

It ran alongside the 2011–12 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nGrenoble claimed the automatic promotion spot as league champions, and Mont-de-Marsan earned the second promotion spot by winning a playoff among the next four teams. Béziers and Périgueux finished in the two bottom spots, which would normally lead to automatic relegation to Fédérale 1. However, Béziers were spared the drop when Bourgoin were forcibly relegated to Fédérale 1 for financial reasons.\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nSeason table.\nUpdated as of 21 May 2012\nResults.\nResults table.\nThe home team is listed in the left column.\nPromotion playoffs.\nAll times CEST."

        "title": "2011–12 BYU Cougars men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2011–12 BYU Cougars men's basketball team represented Brigham Young University in the 2011–12 college basketball season. This was head coach Dave Rose's seventh season at BYU. The Cougars, in their first season in the West Coast Conference, played their home games at the Marriott Center. They finished the season 26–9, 12–4 in WCC play to finish in third place. They lost in the semifinals of the West Coast Basketball tournament to Gonzaga. They received an at-large bid to the 2012 NCAA tournament where they defeated Iona in the First Four round before falling in the Round of 64 (then called the \"Second Round\") to Marquette.\nPreseason.\nThe Cougars, coming off a 2010–11 season that saw them rise as high as #3 in the AP Poll and ended in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament, had to recover from major personnel losses. Consensus national player of the year Jimmer Fredette and all-time BYU steals leader Jackson Emery, called BYU's \"best backcourt ever\" by \"Salt Lake Tribune\" writer Jay Drew, both graduated. Another frequent starter, freshman swingman Kyle Collinsworth, temporarily left the team to go on a two-year LDS mission.\nIn addition to the departing players, assistant Dave Rice left to take the head coaching vacancy at UNLV.\nThe Cougars were picked to finish third in the WCC by the media.\nRecruiting.\nGaining size was a key for the 2011 BYU team. In addition to a returning Brandon Davies who would help inside the paint, BYU focused on three centers, two of which are return missionaries who will have their first playing time. The third center, Isaac Nielson, committed to BYU and announced he would serve a church mission before joining the school for the 2013–14 season. \n2011 media.\nThe school began to hype the basketball season with basketball media days webcasts shown live on BYUtv.org Wednesday, October 12, 2011. Jarom Jordan interviewed all the players, except for Brandon Davies who chose to abstain from interviews until the regular season begins, from the Marriott Center. Common questions asked to the players were how they chose their numbers, what they expected for the upcoming season, what they thought of the new court, and the West Coast Conference. Additionally the Cougars announced that BYUtv would air a True Blue Basketball Preview special on Thursday, November 10, 2011. All Cougar games will be broadcast on the BYU Radio Sports Network with Greg Wrubell serving as the play-by-play man (unless he is away for football) and Mark Durrant providing analysis. When Wrubell is gone for football, Durrant will serve as the play-by-play man with Russ Larson serving as the analyst. Steve Cleveland will also provide analysis on the radio for select conference games. Dave McCann, Blaine Fowler, Steve Cleveland, Robbie Bullough, Jarom Jordan, and Lakia Holmes will provide coverage for BYUtv Sports throughout the season.\nThe Pre-season WCC poll expects the Cougars to finish 3rd behind Gonzaga and St. Mary's and just ahead of Santa Clara.\nBYU Radio Sports Network Affiliates.\nKSL 102.7 FM and 1160 AM- Flagship Station (Salt Lake City/ Provo, UT and ksl.com)&lt;br&gt;\nBYU Radio- Nationwide (Dish Network 980, Sirius XM 143, and byuradio.org)&lt;br&gt;\nKTHK- Blackfoot/ Idaho Falls/ Pocatello/ Rexburg, ID&lt;br&gt;\nKMGR- Manti, UT&lt;br&gt;\nKSUB- Cedar City, UT&lt;br&gt;\nKDXU- St. George, UT\nSchedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002654; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002654; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002654; color:#FFFFFF;\"| WCC tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002654; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\nOn March 13, 2012, BYU set a record for the largest comeback in an NCAA tournament game, as they were down by 25 points at one point in their first match of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and came back to beat the Iona Gaels 78–72.\nGame summaries.\nCougar tipoff.\nBroadcasters: Jarom Jordan and Steve Cleveland\nExhibition: Midwestern State.\nBroadcasters: Dave McCann, Steve Cleveland, and Robbie Bullough\nExhibition: Dixie State.\nBroadcasters: Dave McCann, Steve Cleveland, and Robbie Bullough\nAt Utah State.\nBYU leads series 136-91&lt;br&gt;Broadcasters: Mychal Clanton and Brooks Hansen\nBYU-Hawaii.\nFirst series meeting&lt;br&gt;Broadcasters: Jarom Jordan and Steve Cleveland\nLongwood.\nFirst series meeting&lt;br&gt;Broadcasters: Dave McCann and Steve Cleveland\nPrairie View A&amp;M.\nFirst series meeting&lt;br&gt;Broadcasters: Dave McCann, Blaine Fowler, and Robbie Bullough\nVs.

However, weeks after the formation of the 2015 national men's and women's teams, Dungo and his supporters held a special board meeting and claimed that he has the majority and backing of duly elected members of the PVF Board of Directors. Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) Vice President Joey Romasanta, said that the POC cannot recognize the newly formed squad until the leadership dispute between Chan and Dungo is settled. Romansata accused Dungo and general secretary general Otie Camangian of misleading the national team players that they have the authority to organize the national volleyball teams and asserts that the two are not the federation itself and says that they have to consult the other members of the federation first.

The Philippine Bowling Federation Inc. PBF replaced it as the appointed member of the International Bowling Federation (IBF), Asian Bowling Federation (ABF), and Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). in 2016.\nHistory.\nThe POC member organization PBC registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 24, 1975, with a 25-year corporate term and Col. Nereo C. Andolong as its president and representative to the POC. He was elected the second president of the Philippine Olympic Committee in 1977. Col. Andolong became a director and president of PBC through Magallanes Bowling Association (MBA), founded with Vicente Sotto III.\nPhilippine Bowling Congress SEC registration was officially revoked in 2003 when it allowed its corporate term to expire without complying with law requirements to extend its corporate period of existence stated in the articles of incorporation. However, it continued its usual business as the member association recognized by the governing bodies. Despite this, a new organization bearing a confusingly similar name, Philippine Bowling Congress (PBCI) Inc., was registered with SEC in January 2009 and assumed the role of PBC without valid authorization. This confusingly similar corporation never applied for membership and was never officially recognized by any governing body; instead, only the original member, Philippine Bowling Congress, remained affiliated. POC identified the Officers of PBCI from 2009 to 2016 as that of PBC. Per Philippine law, these are two different entities. Philippine Bowling Congress membership with the POC was also eventually revoked.\nIn early 2016, after the resignation of the newly elected president and vice president of PBCI, the Philippine Olympic Committee established a caretaker body that will temporarily handle the affairs of Philippine bowling, and POC appointed secretary general Steve Hontiveros who was the last president of the defunct Philippine Bowling Congress Inc.\nErnesto A. Lopa established the Philippine Bowling Federation in 1968 before co-founding the PBC in 1969. He was also Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs Asian Zone vice president from 1973-1976. He was also elected to the FIQ World Presidium in London England from 1975-1977.\nThe Philippine Bowling Congress, Inc. was registered with the Securities Exchange Commission on September 24, 1975 S.E.C. Reg. No. 63697. Its first official president was Nereo C. Andolong who was also the second president of the Philippine Olympic Committee from 1977-1980.\nAthletes and their achievements.\nThe Philippine has produced multi-world champions Paeng Nepomuceno, Lita dela Rosa and Bong Coo, world champions Oliver Ongtawco, Cj Suarrez, Biboy Rivera, Team Trios Gold medalists Liza Del Rosario, Liza Clutario and Cecilia Yap and Olympic Gold Medalist Arianne Cerdeña.\nPaeng Nepomuceno and Bong Coo were inducted to the International Bowling Hall of Fame in 1993. Lita Dela Rosa was posthumously inducted in 2000. All three were elected to the Philippine Sports Hall of Fame in 2019.\n1988 Summer Olympic Games.\nBowling at the 1988 Summer Olympics was a demonstration sport for the first, and so far only time. In all, a total of 20 nations competed in the exhibition, which was held on September 18 at the Seoul's Royal Bowling Center. Nonetheless, Arianne Cerdeña won for the Philippines its first gold medal in the Olympic Games.\nWTBA World Tenpin Bowling Championship.\nThe World Tenpin Bowling Championships is a global event that invites all countries that are members of the World Bowling to participate.

        "text": "James Ray Blackburn (June 19, 1924 – October 26, 1969) was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 18 games in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds in 1948 and 1951. The right-hander was a native of Warsaw, Kentucky, who stood tall and weighed .\nWorld War II veteran and POW.\nBlackburn's professional career began at age 17 in 1941, and was interrupted in 1943 by service in the United States Army. Attaining the rank of sergeant, Blackburn saw combat in the European Theatre of World War II. He was wounded in the leg in Belgium on December 18, 1944, during the Battle of St. Vith, one of the opening engagements of the Battle of the Bulge, and was taken as a prisoner of war by the German army; while a POW, his weight dwindled to . After he was liberated by advancing American troops in May 1945, he required months of hospitalization to regain his health.\nReturn to baseball.\nBlackburn was able to return to baseball in 1946. In July 1948 he was recalled to Cincinnati for his first major-league stint, and he appeared in 16 games, all in relief, for a second-division Reds' team. He proved to be highly effective through his first 11 games, but three rough September outings saddled him with two losses and inflated his earned run average from 1.59 to 4.18. Blackburn then missed the entire 1949 season. In 1950, he returned to baseball in the minor leagues, winning 21 games with a stellar 2.73 ERA in the Double-A Texas League. As a result, the Reds gave him a second trial in the early weeks of 1951, but he was ineffective in two appearances, posting a 17.18 ERA in only 3 innings pitched.\nHe resumed his career in the minors, where he played into the 1952 campaign, his last in baseball. In his 18 major-league games, all in relief, he compiled an 0–2 record and a 5.50 ERA, with no saves; in 36 innings pitched, he allowed 46 hits and 16 bases on balls, with 11 strikeouts. Jim Blackburn died in Cincinnati at the age of 45 on October 26, 1969."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington located outside the Royal Exchange, now known as the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, Scotland, is one of Glasgow's most iconic landmarks.\nIt was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in 1844, thanks to public subscription to mark the successful end in 1815 of the long French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Since at least the 1980s it has been traditionally capped with a traffic cone by members of the public. The statue is a Category A listed sculpture.\nStatue.\nThe statue of the Duke on his favourite horse Copenhagen was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in 1844. The statue is a Category-A listed monument.\nTraffic cone.\nIn recent times the statue has become known for being capped with a traffic cone. Adorning the statue with a cone had continued over many years: the act was claimed to represent the humour of the local population and was believed to date back to at least the 1980s.\nIn 2005, Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Police took a stance of asking the public not to replace the cone, citing minor damage to the statue and the potential for injury when attempting to place a cone.\nIn 2011 the Lonely Planet guide included the statue in its list of the \"top 10 most bizarre monuments on Earth\".\nIn 2013 Glasgow City Council put forward plans for a £65,000 restoration project, that included a proposal to double the height of its plinth and raise it to more than in height to \"deter all but the most determined of vandals\". Their planning application contained an estimate that the cost of removing traffic cones from the statue was £100 per callout, and that this could amount to £10,000 a year. The plans were withdrawn after widespread public opposition, including an online petition that received over 10,000 signatures. As the council indicated that action against the practice could still be considered, the art-political organization National Collective organised a rally in defence of the cone.\nIn 2014, in support of the Scottish Independence referendum, the statue was fitted with a \"Yes\" cone as well as a flag fitted in the statue's stirrup.\nThe cone was replaced with a gold painted one during the 2012 Olympics as a celebration of Scotland's contribution to the record haul of gold medals won by Team GB. A replica of the statue, complete with cone, appeared at the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, and a gold cone was then again placed on the statue to mark the success of the games.\nIn 2015, Glasgow City Council tested hi-tech CCTV software worth £1.2m, checking to see whether it could automatically detect people putting cones on the statue, which it could.\nOn Brexit Day (31 January 2020) pro-European supporters placed a cone painted to represent the EU flag on the statue's head.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the statue was adorned with a cone and a blue surgical mask around the statue's ears to reflect the pandemic and lockdowns in the country.\nIn March 2022, in support of Ukraine and as a protest against Russia's invasion of it, the statue was fitted with a cone with the colours of the Ukrainian flag.\nIn June 2023 to promote his exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art, artist Banksy declared that the statue was his \"favourite work of art in the UK\". On 21 June, the Scottish climate change campaigning group This Is Rigged placed a cone with their logo on the statue, and invited Banksy to support their cause."

        "title": "List of Rugby World Cup hat-tricks",
        "text": "Since the inception of the Rugby World Cup in 1987, a total of 69 players have scored three tries or drop goals (a hat-trick) in a single match. The first player to achieve the feat was Craig Green, who scored four tries in New Zealand's 74–13 victory over Fiji during the 1987 Rugby World Cup. His teammate John Gallagher also scored four tries in this match. Besides Green and Gallagher, 15 players have scored more than three tries in a match; of these, Chris Latham and Josh Lewsey have scored five, while Marc Ellis scored six in New Zealand's 145–17 victory against Japan in 1995. Two of Ellis's teammates, Eric Rush and Jeff Wilson, also scored hat-tricks in this game. Five players have scored a hat-trick of drop goals: Jannie de Beer, Jonny Wilkinson, Juan Martín Hernández, Theuns Kotzé and George Ford. Of these, de Beer scored the most in one match, with five drop goals in South Africa's 44–21 victory over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\nHat-tricks are more likely to occur in the pool stages, where higher ranked teams, such as New Zealand, who have scored fourteen World Cup hat-tricks, face lower ranked opposition, such as Namibia, who have conceded hat-tricks on ten occasions. There have only been seven hat-tricks in the World Cup knockout stages: Chester Williams and Jonah Lomu in 1995, de Beer in 1999, Wilkinson in 2003, Julian Savea and Adam Ashley-Cooper in 2015 and Will Jordan in 2023.\nSix players have scored two World Cup hat-tricks, Savea being the only one to have scored both in the same tournament. Of the six teams in the Six Nations and four in the Rugby Championship teams, only Italy have failed to score a hat-trick at the World Cup. Fiji, Namibia and Samoa are the only other teams to score a hat-trick, which were scored by Vereniki Goneva, Kotze and Alesana Tuilagi, respectively. Goneva and Kotze's hat-tricks are the only time players on opposing teams have accomplished this feat in the same match at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nHat-tricks.\nUnless noted otherwise, the players listed below scored a hat-trick of tries.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

The clubhouse of the golf club is located at Barlow Hall, originally built in the 13th century, but rebuilt by Alexander Barlow in 1584. Edward Barlow was born at Barlow Hall in 1585 and was hanged for adhering to the Catholic faith at Lancaster Gaol in 1641. He was later canonized as Saint Ambrose Barlow in 1970 and his ghost reportedly haunts the upper floors of the hall. Although a golf course had existed here for centuries the modern formal club was established in 1903. In September 2011 it hosted the Mersey Championship."

The defending Pan American champion is the team from the United States.\nTeam eventing consisted of three phases: dressage, cross-country, and show-jumping. Scores from each phase were converted into penalty points, which were summed to give a score. Teams of up to five horse and rider pairs competed; for each team, the best three scores in each phase counted towards the team score.\nIn the dressage portion, the pair performed in front of three judges. The judges gave marks of between 0 and 10 for each of ten required elements; the scores for the judges were averaged to give a score between 0 and 100. That score was then subtracted from 100 and multiplied by 1.5 to give the number of penalty points.\nThe cross-county portion consisted of a 5.225 kilometer course with 30 efforts including 17 obstacles. The target time was nine and a half minutes; pairs received .4 penalty points for every second above that time. They also received 20 penalty points for every obstacle not cleanly jumped. Riders did not complete the course in under nineteen minutes were eliminated and given a score of 1000 penalty points.\nThe final phase was the show-jumping; pairs had to negotiate a course of obstacles. The pair received 4 penalty points for each obstacle at which there was a refusal or a knockdown of the obstacle. One penalty point was also assessed for each second taken above the maximum time for the course.\nIn addition, 1000 points are given to any rider that did not complete a competition. This includes withdraing/not-starting (WD), retiring during the competition (RD) or being eliminated in the cross county event (EL).\nThe results of the team phase were also used in the individual eventing event, though that event added a second jumping phase as a final."

The defending champion was the team from Cuba.\nThe team épée competition consisted of a four-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers and classification semifinals and finals for 5th to 8th places. Teams consist of three members each. Matches consist of nine bouts, with every fencer on one team facing each fencer on the other team. Scoring carried over between bouts with a total of 45 touches being the team goal. Bouts lasted until one team reached the target multiple of 5 touches. For example, if the first bout ended with a score of 5–3, that score would remain into the next bout and the second bout would last until one team reached 10 touches. Bouts also had a maximum time of three minutes each; if the final bout ended before either team reached 45 touches, the team leading at that point won. A tie at that point would result in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout."

The bronze statue sculpted by Francis Chantrey in the United Kingdom in 1834 and shipped to Madras in 1839, is one of the popular landmarks in Chennai. The absence of stirrups is one of the peculiarities of the statue and for this reason, it is also referred to as \"The Stirrupless Majesty\".\nThomas Munro.\nThomas Munro was one of the most popular British administrators in South India. Born in Glasgow in 1761, Munro arrived in India as a soldier in 1789 and fought with distinction in the Anglo-Mysore Wars. At the end of the war, he served as a settlement officer in Canara and later, Bellary. He also fought in the Pindari War (1817). In 1820, Munro was appointed Governor of Madras and served till his death from cholera in 1827. Munro is credited with having introduced the Ryotwari System in South India and drafting an education policy for the Madras Presidency. He also supported a larger share for natives in the administration of India. Munro is the subject of a number of folk tales and ballads and is even worshipped by some.\nDeath of Thomas Munro.\nMunro's term as Governor of Madras came to an end in 1826. As there was a delay in appointing a new Governor, Munro decided to visit the Ceded Districts of the Madras Presidency, where he had served as a settlement officer in the early 19th century, in the meantime. As he was riding through the hills of Cuddapah District along with a mixed retinue of Europeans and Indians, Munro observed a golden, thread-like glow across two hills. He remarked\nHis followers were perplexed as the garland was not visible to anyone. At length, an old Indian in the retinue reportedly replied, with sorrow:\nAfter spending a few days at Ananthapur, Thomas Munro and his party reached Gooty on 4 July 1827. At Gooty, some of his men were afflicted with cholera. Two days later, at Pattikonda, Munro caught cholera from his men and had to be nursed. His condition deteriorated in the evening and he died at half-past-nine on 6 July 1827.\nMunro was buried at a graveyard in Gooty. In April 1831, his remains were transported to Madras and interred in the St. Mary's Church, Fort St. George.\nConstruction.\nWhen the news of Munro's death reached Madras, it was mourned by all classes of people in the city. The government issued a Gazette Extraordinary on 9 July 1827 with the message:\nA public meeting was soon held in his memory in Madras city in which was made a proposal to erect a statue to Munro through public subscription. The Madras government opened a memorial for Munro in the town of Pattikonda where he had died. A choultry called \"Munro Choultry\" was erected in Gooty in his honour.\nA total of nine thousand pounds (£8000, according to some sources) were collected through public subscription and the British sculptor Francis Chantrey was commissioned to make the statue. Chantrey completed the statue in 1834 - one of the three equestrian statues sculpted by him. According to a popular belief, the Duke of Wellington, on seeing the completed statue, had exclaimed\nThe statue, weighing six tonnes, was shipped to India in three parts and erected at The Island, Chennai in 1839 atop a granite plinth made by Ostheider &amp; Co of Calcutta. The statue was ceremonially opened on 23 October 1839.\nArchitecture.\nThe statue depicts Thomas Munro riding a horse. In doing so, Chantrey had opted to follow, for commemorative purposes, the prevalent Western practice of portraying authority. It is believed that Chantrey might have modelled the statue upon his own earlier work of George IV at Trafalgar Square, London. This might have been intended to elevate Munro above the Indians whose cause he championed. Chantrey was, initially, caught in a dilemma over the choice of steed. While some of his friends and visitors suggested a classic horse, some suggested an Arabian, others a war horse. Eventually, Chantrey chose an Arab, similar to the one he had sculpted for his statue of George IV. One particular biography of Francis Chantrey considered the sculpture of Thomas Munro to be the finest among Chantrey's works and the horse, his worst ever.\nThe combined height of the horse and the rider is more than 15 feet. The horse gazes calmly while Munro strikes a thoughtful pose, both still, yet ready to lunge forward into motion.\nPeculiarity.\nThe peculiarity of the statue is the absence of a saddle as well as the stirrups. While some feel that the omission is due to an oversight on the part of the sculptor, others feel that the saddle and the stirrups might have been deliberately excluded keeping in mind Munro's penchant for bareback riding. Due to the absence of stirrups, the statue is also occasionally referred to as \"The Stirrupless Majesty\".\nHistorical references.\nCaptain Hervey has been credited with popularizing an anecdote connected with Munro's statue\nProposed removal.\nDuring the World Classical Tamil Conference held in Coimbatore in 2010, there were demands to remove the statue of Thomas Munro, evoking strong protests from conservationists. Though the government had arrived at a decision to remove the statue, it has not yet been implemented."

        "title": "Portland (minor league baseball team)",
        "text": "Portland was the name of a professional baseball team that a member of the fleeting Oregon State League in 1893. Portland represented Portland, Oregon and played against teams from Albany, Independence, and Oregon City. In the early stages of the team, H. Hammond oversaw the club's operations. Later, W. H. Kennedy led the team financially and Edward Stapleton bore the managerial duties. Portland used City View Park as their home until switching to the West End Grounds after June 25. In all league games, Portland played 18 games compiling seven wins and 11 losses.\nFormation.\nA Portland club was one of the four planned team to be a member of the newly formed Oregon State League. In March, there was a report that Henry W. Hammond of Portland was working to get a baseball league in the State of Oregon. Hammond announced he was looking for financial backers for teams in Portland, Salem, Astoria, Albany, Eugene, The Dalles, and Oregon City. The name \"Oregon State League\" was later devised and expected to start sometime in late-May with a four-team circuit.\nAt a league convention on May 11, 1893 in Salem, Oregon, Hammond and Watts released the league constitution, and by-laws. Both stepped down as leaders of the league and in their place league owners voted W. M. Hunt of the Salem club as president. A few weeks later, Hunt announced the league's schedule would feature 36 games. The original league schedule had Albany traveling to Portland on May 27, however, the league's opening day was pushed back to May 30 due to bad weather. Before their first game, Portland worked deals with the local electric streetcar operators to give fans a discount of fare to City View Park, the club's home field. Admission into the park would cost twenty-five cents a person. Women, however, had the privilege of being admitted into the grandstands for free while their male counterparts were faced with an additional twenty-five cent charge.\nRegular season.\nPortland's official first game started at 2:45 p.m. on May 30, 1893. Their opponent was changed from Albany to Oregon City. The crowd was described as \"large\". Albert Collet of the Independence club was allowed to play for Portland since their newly signed second baseman had yet made it to town. Both teams played sloppy according to \"The Oregonian\" as Portland lost 13–19. Portland's second game was played against the Albany club at City View Park in front of a \"small crowd\". Albany took the game, 11–5.\nOn June 4, Portland faced Albany for the second time in as many days, losing to them by a score of 6–11. On their first road trip, Portland traveled to Albany where they were beat twice in one weekend (June 10–11). The final game of the series was in front of a crowd of 1,000 people. Portland's sixth straight loss since the opening of the season came on June 17 in Independence. It was noted that not many people turned out to see Portland fall to the home team 11–5.\nPortland's first win of the season came on June 18 in Independence. Portland toppled the home team, 5–1. During their scheduled home game against Independence on June 24, Portland was forced to switch venues at the last minute since their ballpark was being occupied by an amateur team. The two clubs instead used the Oregon City ballpark where Portland defeated Independence 10–9. On June 25, Portland compiled 17 hits, and stole 26 bases in their victory over Independence. The two clubs instead used the Oregon City ballpark where Portland defeated Independence 10–9. Five-hundred spectators were present as Portland marked their first game at their new home, West End Grounds.\nIn their next four games, Portland faced Oregon City. The first two games were played on the weekend of July 2–3 in Oregon City. During the second game, Portland's Rankin hit two home runs. Both ended in losses for Portland. The teams traveled back to Portland for the next weekend's series. The two games took place at West End Grounds. Portland won both match-ups. During their next match-up in Albany on July 15, Portland out-scored the home team 19–12. Albany was defeated by Portland again the next day. The score was 7–4. Portland was two wins away from a .500 winning percentage with their 7–9 record going into their game against Albany which was scheduled to be played in Astoria, Oregon, on July 22. Albany won the closely contested game, 10–9. Portland's last recorded game came on July 30 at Oregon City. Portland was edged 6–5 in that contest. The league folded after the game and play was canceled.\nIt was announced on August 12, 1893, that the Portland club was going to travel to Boise, Idaho, to play their team. In the first game, Portland sent Youngy Johnson to start. Boise edged Portland 7–6. Portland also lost the second game, 10–8."

The game also allows for simulated matches with no player input. The player can choose from a roster of real fighters from different eras, or create a boxer with customized abilities.\nDevelopment.\n\"Sierra Championship Boxing\" was the first PC game Evryware developed. The game was initially going to be published by Microsoft, but Microsoft decided at the last minute that the home market wasn't big enough yet. Evryware's contact at Microsoft told Ken Williams at Sierra On-Line about the game; Sierra offered Evryware a contract and published the game in 1983.\nReception.\n\"InfoWorld\" called Sierra Championship Boxing \"by far the most extensive sports game created for a microcomputer\" and suggested that the game \"could usher in a new era of sports simulation games\" that use \"the power and memory of the IBM PC and PC Jr\" to store detailed information about real people. \"Computer Gaming World\" reviewed the Commodore version negatively. The reviewer praised the game's options and graphics, but criticized its lack of realism. \"PC Magazine\" gave the game 14.5 points out of 18, calling it \"one of those breakthrough games that comes along ever so infrequently these days ... \"Championship Boxing\" is a knockout\"."

        "title": "Hever Golf Rose",
        "text": "Hever Golf Rose (22 February 1991 – September 1999) was a thoroughbred racehorse who was bred and trained in the United Kingdom, and campaigned throughout Europe in a career that lasted from 1993 to 1998. She was a specialist sprinter, showing her best form over distances of five and six furlongs (1000m and 1200m), who was known for her consistency and durability, and was particularly effective on soft ground. In a six-year career, she ran in sixty-six races and won seventeen. In her best season in 1995 she won six Group races and was named European Champion Sprinter. A year after her retirement, Hever Golf Rose died after failing to recover from the anaesthetic following an operation on a joint injury.\nBackground.\nHever Golf Rose was bred by Ronald Popely who named her after his Hever Castle Golf Club. She was sired by Efisio out of the mare Sweet Rosina. Efisio, who was also owned by Popely for part of his stud career, sired the winners of almost a thousand races including twelve at Group One level. Sweet Rosina went on to produce the successful handicappers Go Hever Golf and Play Hever Golf.\nPopely sent Hever Golf Rose to the Doncaster St Leger sales as a yearling but bought her in for 6,000 gns when she failed to attract interest. Popely later sold her privately to Michael P Hanson for a reported fee of £100,000.\nHever Golf Rose was trained throughout her career by Joe Naughton at The Durdans stables at Epsom, Surrey. Naughton had begun training in 1991 and Hever Golf Rose was his first important winner. She had many jockeys but was most closely associated with Jason Weaver, who rode her for eleven of her thirteen races in her championship season of 1995.\nRacing career.\n1993: two-year-old season.\nHever Golf Rose made her debut when finishing fourth in a maiden race at Leicester in May and was runner-up in a similar event at Chepstow in July. In the next sixteen days she recorded her first two wins in a maiden race at Doncaster and a Nursery (a handicap for two-year-olds) at Newmarket.\n1994: three-year-old season.\nOn her first race as a three-year-old Hever Golf Rose finished last in the Masaka Stakes at Kempton on her first and only start over a mile. Switched back to sprint distance she progressed steadily through handicaps and Listed races, winning three of her remaining thirteen starts, and improving her official rating from 73 to 105. She won handicaps at Newmarket and York and, on the first of her many foreign trips, the Silberne Peitsche (then a Listed race) at \nGelsenkirchen.\n1995: four-year-old season.\nSpring.\nHever Golf Rose's championship season began with a third place in the Listed Leicestershire Stakes on her second and final race beyond pure sprint distances. She then took her first Group race when she was sent to Rome for the Premio Melton and won by one and a half lengths from Fred Bongusto. Twelve days later she appeared in Germany, running fourth in the Bénazet-Rennen.\nSummer.\nIn June, she was sent to Sweden where she finished fourth in the Taby Varsprint. Hever Golf Rose now began the most successful period of her career, winning seven of her next eight races. After winning a Listed race in Bremen, she stayed in Germany to take the Group Three Holsten Trophy beating Desidera by one and a half lengths.\nShe returned to England for the King George Stakes at Goodwood for which she started at odds of 10/1. Hever Golf Rose appeared to be struggling and short of space to run in the early stages but produced a \"strong burst\" of speed in the last quarter mile to come from last to first and win by half a length to the \"astonishment\" of the spectators. In recording her only career victory on firm ground she set a new track record of 56.25. In the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes at York in August Jason Weaver attempted to make all the running but was caught in the closing stages and finished third to So Factual.\nTen days after the York race she was back in Sweden, where she won the Taby Open Sprint Championship and only three days after that she appeared at Baden-Baden where she led from the start to take the Goldene Peitsche by two lengths from the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Lavinia Fontana.\nAutumn.\nHever Golf Rose's next two races took her to France. At Chantilly she was sent off the 11/10 favourite for the Prix de Seine-et-Oise in which she raced prominently and held off the late challenge of Tereshkova to win by a neck. Joe Naughton called her \"an amazing filly\" after the win, while the press commented on her \"remarkable\" season. After four races in twenty-five days, Hever Golf Rose was given a \"break\" of three weeks before her run in the Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp.\nThe race featured a meeting with another four-year-old filly, the French-trained Cherokee Rose, who had won her last four races including the Prix Maurice de Gheest and the Haydock Sprint Cup. Cherokee Rose was sent off the odds on favourite, with Hever Golf Rose starting at 3.1/1. Weaver tracked Eveningperformance in the early stages before moving his filly into the lead two furlongs out. Hever Golf Rose went clear and although Cherokee Rose finished strongly, she could not catch the English filly who recorded her biggest success by a margin of two and a half lengths. The performance was described by Sue Montgomery, writing in the \"Independent\", as a \"dazzling solo tour-de-force\".\nOn her final start she was sent to the United States, the sixth country she had visited that year, for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. It was her first race on dirt, although she had encountered the surface in training. Before the race, Joe Naughton paid tribute to his filly's ability to cope with her busy schedule saying that \"she really thrives on racing and she travels brilliantly.\" In the race at Belmont she showed some speed to reach third place in the straight, but faded in the closing stages to finish eighth of the thirteen runners behind Desert Stormer.\n1996: five-year-old season.\nHever Golf Rose failed to win in thirteen starts as five-year-old, despite running prominently in top sprint races all over Europe. She finished second in the Goldene Peitsche, the Holsten Trophy, the King George Stakes, the Taby Varsprint and the Bénazet-Rennen, and third in the July Cup, the Nunthorpe Stakes, the Prix de l'Abbaye and the Premio Omenoni.\nAfter her narrow defeat in the King George Stakes the \"Independent's\" correspondent described her as \"one of the most willing and popular horses in training.\"\n1997: six-year-old season.\nAt six, Hever Golf Rose ran seventeen times in a campaign that ran from April to November. She competed in five different counties and recorded three wins. In May at Longchamp she disputed the lead for most of the way in the Prix de Saint-Georges and ran under pressure in the final furlong to beat Titus Livius by a short neck. In June was sent to Sweden where she went clear in the straight in to win the Täby Varsprint by two lengths. She returned to Longchamp in October for the Prix du Petit Couvert in which she took the lead a furlong out and won by one and a half lengths from the Prix de l'Abbaye winner Kistena.\n1998: seven-year-old season.\nHever Golf Rose was in foal to Danehill in 1998, but still ran in five races. She recorded her last win when taking her second Täby Varsprint in June and ended her career later in the same month when running unplaced in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot.\nAssessment.\nHever Golf Rose was voted European Champion Sprinter in the 1995 Cartier Racing Awards.\nRetirement and death.\nHever Golf Rose was covered by Danehill in spring 1998, before her final year of racing. She gave birth to a colt foal in 1999. In September Hever Golf Rose underwent surgery for a joint injury at Newmarket. She did not recover from the anaesthetic and her death was reported in the Racing Post on 1 October. She was in foal to the 2000 Guineas winner Entrepreneur at the time. Ronald Popely was reportedly too upset to comment; Joe Naughton said \"She was a one-off. It is really tragic... She didn't owe anybody anything and was a real star.\""

The university dropped their men's program at the end of the 2007–08 season.\nProgram History.\nWayne State University began its men's ice hockey program in 1999, one of several programs to begin at or promote their programs to Division I ice hockey in the late 1990s. Before their first season the Warriors signed Bill Wilkinson as their first coach, hoping that his 20-year track record at Western Michigan would help bring in recruits and build the program quickly.\nAfter a year as an Independent, Wayne State was invited to join College Hockey America, a conference made entirely of newly D-I programs. The Warriors were able to perform very well in the first few years, winning a conference championship, three consecutive conference tournaments and earning a bid to the 2003 NCAA Tournament (the first CHA automatic bid).\nThe most glaring problem with the ice hockey program at Wayne State was the university's lack of an on-campus ice rink. As a result, the team was forced to rent out space in various buildings over its existence. This combined with the Warriors inability to play other regional teams led to waning interest in the program despite being located in the hockey-friendly city of Detroit.\nWith the program losing money every year and the CCHA not looking to increase its membership beyond 12 teams, Wayne State decided to end its program after the 2007–08 season.\nFour years after its dissolution, ice hockey returned to Wayne State as a club sport.\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\""

        "text": "Bradley Michael Hunt (born August 24, 1988) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers, St. Louis Blues, Nashville Predators, Vegas Golden Knights, Minnesota Wild, and Vancouver Canucks. Hunt beginning his professional career in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Chicago Wolves, where he was an All-Star in the 2012–13 season. He is considered undersized for a defenseman, but has a hard slapshot.\nPrior to turning professional, Hunt played college hockey with the Bemidji State Beavers. While there, he helped them to two NCAA tournaments, including a Cinderella run to the Frozen Four in 2009. He also earned multiple individual honours during his time at Bemidji State and left as the Beaver's all-time leader in defenseman scoring and defenseman power play goals. As a junior ice hockey player, Hunt was a member of the Burnaby Express team that won the 2006 Royal Bank Cup as Canadian junior A champions. He was twice named the team's Most Outstanding Defensemen. Internationally, Hunt has represented Canada on one occasion, winning a gold medal at the 2023 IIHF World Championship.\nEarly life.\nHunt was born on August 24, 1988, in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, to Steve and Tricia Hunt. He has a younger sister, Brittany. As a child Steve, a former Senior AA goaltender, set up a deck for Brad to shoot pucks from in the family's backyard. Growing up, he was best friends with Victor Bartley, who also plays professional hockey.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nHunt began playing in the Ridge Meadows Minor Hockey Association at the atom level. He began as a forward but in pee-wee he switched to defence to gain more playing time. He played two years of midget AAA then made the junior B Ridge Meadows Flames in the Pacific Junior Hockey League (PJHL) as a sixteen-year-old. In his first year with the Flames, he was named the team's Rookie of the Year and played in the PJHL All-Star and Prospect Game. During the season, he was called up to the junior A Burnaby Express in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). He played just three games for the Express and an additional two playoff games. That said, he was with the team when they won the 2006 Royal Bank Cup as Canadian junior A champions. He stayed with the Express the following season and played in 60 games scoring 4 goals and 38 points and added another 8 points in 14 playoff games. For his efforts, he was named the team's Most Outstanding Defenceman. In the 2007–08 season, his final with the team, he increased his offensive production to 16 goals and 55 points and played in the BCHL All-Star Game. He was again named the team's Most Outstanding Defenceman, while the Express Lost in Round 1 in 5 Games against the Victoria Grizzlies.\nFollowing his third season in junior, Hunt attended Bemidji State University (BSU). While there, he played with the Bemidji State Beavers, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. In his first season with the Beavers, Hunt scored 9 goals and 32 points in 33 games. BSU won the College Hockey America (CHA) tournament with Hunt being named to the CHA All-Tournament Team. By winning the tournament, Bemidji State earned an automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The Beavers entered the tournament as the lowest seeded team and matched up with Notre Dame. BSU upset the Fighting Irish and proceed to defeat Cornell University, advancing to the Frozen Four. With the wins, Bemidji State became the first number 16 seed to make the Frozen Four, and the first team to ever make the Frozen Four from outside college hockey's top four conferences. Their Cinderella run ended with a 4–1 loss to Miami University. Hunt was named to the NCAA Midwest Regional All-Tournament Team. At the end of the season, he was also named to the All-CHA Rookie Team, All-CHA First Team, and named CHA Rookie of the Year.\nIn his second season, Hunt's goal production dipped slightly to 7, but he increased his assist total to 26. His assist total was one shy of tying the school's Division I single season record held by Luke Erickson. At the end of the season, he was again named to the All-CHA First Team. In the 2010 CHA Tournament, the top-ranked Beavers were upset by Niagara University in the first round and later tied Robert Morris University in the consolation game. Though they failed to capture the automatic bid for the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, BSU received an at-large bit thanks in part to a school record 22 consecutive weeks of being ranked in the top 15. The Beavers lost in the first round of the tournament to the University of Michigan.\nFor the 2010–11 season, Bemidji State moved from the CHA to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Hunt's point production dropped in the new conference as he registered 3 goals and 21 points. He stated that part of reason for the drop in production was teams recognizing his shooting ability and preventing him from getting shots off. While his individual numbers were lower, he was the quarterback of one of the conference's top power plays. In the 2011 WCHA Tournament, the Beavers advanced to the semifinals where they were defeated by the University of Denver. In his senior season, Hunt was named one of the team's alternate captains. He increased his production in the WCHA, scoring 5 goals and 26 points while reducing his penalty minutes (PIMs) to a career low 8. In the 2012 WCHA Tournament, Bemidji State lost in the first round to University of North Dakota. By finishing his Bemidji State career with 112 points, Hunt became just the sixth defenceman in school history to eclipse the 100 point mark and left as the Beaver's all-time leader in defenceman scoring and defenceman power play goals.\nProfessional.\nUndrafted out of college, Hunt signed an amateur tryout contract with the American Hockey League's (AHL) Chicago Wolves, where his first head coach was Craig MacTavish. He scored his first professional goal on March 29, 2012, in a game against the Abbotsford Heat in front of 40 friends and family members. He played 14 games for Chicago, registering one goal and five points. He remained with the Wolves for the Calder Cup playoffs, playing in 5 games scoring 1 goal and 5 points as the Wolves lost in the first round to the San Antonio Rampage. In the off-season, the Wolves signed Hunt to a standard player contract. In his first full professional season, Hunt was named to the 2013 AHL All-Star Game, replacing the injured Brett Sterling as the Wolves' representative. At the time of the announcement, Hunt was Chicago's leading scorer among defenceman. At the All-Star skills competition, he participated in three events; Puck Control Relay, Hardest Shot, and Breakaway Relay. He finished third in the Hardest Shot competition recording a 99.5 miles per hour (mph) shot. In the game, Hunt scored a first period goal helping the Western Conference to a 7–6 victory. He finished the season with 4 goals and 33 points as the Wolves missed the playoffs.\nIn the off-season, Hunt signed a two-year entry level contract with the Edmonton Oilers, for whom MacTavish had become the general manager. He attended Oilers training camp and in his first preseason game, Hunt registered two assists against the Vancouver Canucks. He failed to make the team out of camp and was assigned to the Oilers AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. Hunt played 29 games for the Barons, scoring 3 goals and 15 points, leading the Oklahoma City defence in scoring. After the Oilers suffered some injuries on the back-end, he was called up to Edmonton. He made his NHL debut on January 3, 2014, in a game against the Anaheim Ducks. Hunt played 10:53 and finished as a –1 in the game. He played in two more games before being reassigned to Oklahoma City.\nOn July 2, 2016, Hunt effectively made a return to the Chicago Wolves, in agreeing as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the St. Louis Blues. In the 2016–17 season, Hunt excelled with the Wolves, leading the league in scoring, as a defenceman, through 23 games. He was recalled by the Blues and despite making an immediate impact, was later placed on waivers after 9 games on January 16, 2017. He was claimed the following day by the injury-depleted Nashville Predators.\nOn July 1, 2017, having left the Predators as a free agent, Hunt agreed to a two-year, one-way contract with expansion club, the Vegas Golden Knights. On January 21, 2019, after playing in 58 games for the Golden Knights, Hunt was traded to the Minnesota Wild along with a sixth round 2019 NHL Entry Draft draft pick in exchange for a 5th round pick in the 2019 Draft. He tallied 3 powerplay goals and added 5 points in 29 games from the blueline with the Wild, as the club missed the playoffs for the first time in 7 seasons.\nOn June 24, 2019, Hunt was signed to a two-year, $1.4 million contract extension to remain with the Wild.\nAfter the better part of three seasons with the Wild, Hunt left the club as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Vancouver Canucks on July 28, 2021.\nAs a free agent from the Canucks, Hunt was signed to a two-year, two-way contract with the reigning Stanley Cup champions, the Colorado Avalanche, on July 15, 2022. After attending the Avalanche 2022 training camp, Hunt was placed on waivers and re-assigned to the begin the season with AHL affiliate, the Colorado Eagles. Adding a veteran presence to the depth on the blueline of the Avalanche organization, Hunt played in a top-pairing role with the Eagles and was leading the team in scoring with 20 points through only 22 games before he was recalled by the Avalanche on December 9, 2022. He immediately made his Avalanche debut in a 2-1 shootout defeat to the New York Rangers. He recorded his first goal with the Avalanche against former club, the Edmonton Oilers, in a 3-2 overtime victory on January 7, 2023. He was initially named as the Eagles representative to the AHL All-Star Classic, marking his sixth occasion, however remained with the Avalanche. Hunt added 6 points through 26 games with the Avalanche before he was placed on waivers due to the returning health of the blueline on February 11, 2023. Hunt made his return to the Colorado Eagles on February 17 after clearing waivers where he was named team captain.\nInternational play.\nOn May 5, 2023, Hunt was named to Canada men's national ice hockey team at the 2023 IIHF World Championship where he recorded three assists in ten games and won a gold medal."

        "title": "Archery in Bhutan",
        "text": "Archery in Bhutan (Dzongkha: (\"da\"); Wylie: ; 'arrow,' 'archery') is the national sport of the Kingdom. Archery was declared the national sport in 1971, when Bhutan became a member of the United Nations. Since then, the popularity of Bhutanese archery has increased both inside and outside Bhutan, with a measure of government promotion. Bhutan also maintains an Olympic archery team. Previously, competitions were held only at dzongkhag and gewog levels, however modernly, archery tournaments and competitions are held throughout the country. Archery is played during religious and secular public holidays in Bhutan, local festivals (tsechu), between public ministries and departments, and between the dzonkhag and the regional teams. Archery tournaments and performances have also become a significant point of interest for tourism in Bhutan.\nArchery in Bhutan is culturally distinctive because it is a martial art practiced among a modern population that abhors killing. Bhutanese people from different social strata find archery one of the most enjoyable sports, being both fun and physical exercise. In addition, archery builds concentration, which contributes to mental development; according to a Bhutanese proverb, both sailing and archery require intelligence. Archery in Bhutan is a way of socialization, communication, and development of relations between people. Emotions run high during competitions, and support for archers and ridicule or distraction of opponents can become as violent as in other countries' sporting events.\nArchery competitions.\nEvery village has a field for archery; Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu is one of the kingdom's most prominent archery fields. The most notable archery competition in Bhutan are Coronation National Archery tournament and Yangphel tournament. Other major archery competitions are held during Losar, the Bhutanese and Tibetan New Year.\nThe distance to the target is about . The relatively small targets are cut from wood and brightly painted, usually measuring about tall and wide. Bullseyes are called . Traditionally, Bhutanese bows are made of bamboo, and arrows from bamboo or reeds, fletched with feather vanes. Arrows may be painted and tipped with metal arrowheads. Quivers may be wooden, with an animal hide covering and a woven strap.\nBhutanese archery teams number at 13 players; teams take turns shooting two arrows at a time first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. The first to score 25 points wins, however because the scoring system is complicated, winning can take a very long time. For example, a second hit by an opponent can invalidate the other player's score. In addition, the interplay of wider socializing and festivities, with archery as the nominal focus, gives Bhutanese archery competitions an excruciatingly slow pace. In the past, the most traditional matches could last for as long as a month, though modern matches tend to span a number of days.\nPreparations for archery matches are different from other sports: competitors are advised not to spend the night with their wives the night before the competition in order to achieve a high level of concentration. On the eve of a competition, the team spends the night in the woods or in a barn. Opening events precede the initiation and breakfast, and alcoholic beverages can be consumed on the morning of competitions. Teams often employ astrologers to select competing members. In their prognostications, astrologers use puppets () to symbolize archers, puppets of fate who have no control of their destiny. These astrologers are often hired at substantial fees in archers' attempts to have favorable performances, cast curses against other archers, and gain an upper hand. Astrologers also calculate the time and place for competition.\nModern archery competitions feature compound bows, corporate sponsorships, copious cash and material winnings, injuries, and occasional fatalities. The popularity of archery has raised questions of Bhutan's susceptibility to doping, including by alcohol, in the sport. The increased modern popularity of archery has also drawn attention to the danger in the sport, especially to spectators, residents, and passers by near archery ranges. Since 2010, Bhutan has held the Lyonchen Jigmi Y Thinley Archery Tournament, encouraging the use of traditional bows and the development of gewog teams.\nWomen in archery.\nWomen in Bhutan are traditionally active participants in archery competitions, both at home and on the sidelines. To support their husbands, archers' wives prepare their best dishes and drinks. Their older children prepare and bring butter tea and alcoholic beverages to the shooting range, accompanied by younger children. Men participating in the match then bestow upon friends and the match coordinators food and beverages prepared by their wives.\nDuring the matches, women cheer their husbands or favorites with heavily symbolic songs. They also mock opponents with distracting gesticulations and humorous insults. One insult goes: \"Whose forehead is bulging and swollen like a wine-serving spoon, his arrow won't even hit the mark! But even if it does, it's the lowest score!, '!\" (\"!\") Another more burlesque insult goes: \"Whose lips are black as a beard, his arrow won't even hit the mark! But even if it does, it's the lowest score!, '!\" (\"!\")\nRegarding archery, one Bhutanese proverb says, \"Archery and discus are to men, as songs and dances are to women,\" indicating archery is a traditionally male-dominated sport. Nonetheless, modern prominent archers include Dorji Dema and Tshering Chhoden, two Bhutanese women.\nVerbal battles.\nCompeting archers also engage in verbal battle, giving players a chance to display intellectual and literary skills. In archery matches, bombarding opponents with verbal confrontation is equally important to scoring bullseyes. Players and teammates praise their own arrows, lend advice and encouragement to each other, and demean opponents in florid literary expressions known as . Competitors must be prepared to provoke or reply in an equal or more impressive literary fashion.\nOne such line from a verbal battle goes: \"Where the vulture flies, my stone shall fly, there to collide.\" (), demeaning the opponent and promising a bullseye to reset his team's score.\nHistory.\nThroughout the history of Bhutan, fire and the bow and arrow were an important means of survival in the highlands during war and on hunts. The bow and arrow play a significant role in many Bhutanese myths and legends; images of the gods holding a bow and arrows are considered especially favorable. Symbolic and religious significance of the bow and arrow is associated with the legendary murder of Tibetan King Langdarma in the 10th century. The king had persecuted Buddhism, and thus failed to perform his duty as he made mischief. A Buddhist monk, Lhalung Pelgyi Dorje, performed the Black Hat Dance to entertain the king, during which he feigned a bow before the king, drew a bow and arrow hidden in the big sleeves of a ceremonial dance costume, and killed the king.\nIn the 15th century, most prophecies by Lama Drukpa Kunley are believed to have originated from his bow and arrows. Modernly, the bow and arrows are an obligatory feature of any religious ceremony, ritual, festival, and holiday in Bhutan. Archery has also been a favorite sport of the King of Bhutan, handed down from generation to generation.\nDuring the Bhutanese period of theocratic rule (1616–1907), there was no regular standing army. The bow and arrow were among the principal means of arming the population during frequent upheavals and invasions. During times of crisis, the government raised militias from among local lords' retinues, all commanded by one (Dzongkha: ; Wylie: ; 'arrow chief'). The title continued to be used among military cadres well after the establishment of the Bhutanese monarchy in 1907.\nThe cultural significance of archery in Bhutan can be observed at shrines to local gods, where historically arrows were confiscated as tribute and in modern times are often left as offerings.\nOlympic Games.\nBhutan has competed in Olympic Games since 1984. of archers that have competed at the Olympic Games.\nArchery outside of Bhutan.\nAustralia.\nIn March 2022, 104 Bhutanese participated in an archery tournament in Canberra. It was called \"Druk Hybrid Archery Championship\". There were 21 teams with 5 members each. "

        "text": "The goals of the Texas Junior Golf Tour (TGJT) is to prepare junior golfers, male and female, for national competitions while assisting and educating members on elite junior golf opportunities to enhance golf and academic scholarship opportunities. The TJGT is a regional tour in Texas that offers 85 competitive junior golf tournaments for national and international contestants.\nOverview.\nThe TJGT was founded in Austin in 1989 when parents and coaches of high school golfers realized there was a need for a higher level regional junior golf tour for their children in the Fall and Winter to supplement the high school golf season. TJGT is focused on golfers ages 12–18, however, throughout the years, the tour has created the 'Elite Mini Tour' (ages 8–12) and the TCAT (Texas Collegiate Amateur Tour) (ages 19–25). Although those sub tours have far fewer events, they are still highly competitive. The most attractive aspect of the tour is that TJGT and AJGA (American Junior Golf Association) have networked such that TJGT tournaments offer AJGA performance based entry. Also, TJGT tournaments are ranked nationally by AJGA, Golfweek, and Junior Golf Scoreboard. Despite it being a state tour, there are members from all over the country and international members. A few countries that are represented are Mexico, Scotland, Venezuela, Ecuador, Canada, and Korea. There is a select board of directors composed of ex-college coaches and parents of distinguished players that makes many of the financial decisions, endorsement deals, and obtaining the sites where the tournaments will be held. Some endorsements include Titleist, Oakley, Supreme Golf, and Galleria Dallas, and the Texas Association of Golf Coaches.\nTJGT utilizes a points system. The top 15 finishers in each tournament receive points (the amount is based on what place one took in the tournament and the magnitude of the tournament i.e.: regular versus major versus invitational). At the end of the year, there is a tournament of champions where the top point leaders will play one final tournament. These points also determine the player of the year and who makes the All Tour Team. This All Tour Team gets recognition from many college coaches and helps vault them into the eyes of top division 1 programs.\nAlumni.\nAs many golfers graduate this tour and go on to play college golf, there are some who have made it to the PGA\nand LPGA. Notables include Jhonattan Vegas and Stacy Lewis, both winners on the professional level. Notable \ncollegiate players include Bronson Burgoon, who was a major factor in the NCAA Division One Championship\nTexas A&amp;M team.\nTournament Opportunities.\nThe Texas Junior Golf Tour offers high competition tournaments all year long throughout Texas. While most are located around Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, there are plenty of tournaments throughout other areas of Texas. The tour has grown from having 8 tournaments to 85 tournaments per year. The most unusual aspect of the TJGT is that it offers tournaments throughout the fall and winter months. College coaches like this because kids show their love and desire for the game when playing in the cold and rainy months. Of the 85 tournaments offered, 5 of them are elite invitational tournaments and 11 major tournaments. These provide even greater competition for the junior golfers. Tournaments are held at may different locations throughout Texas. Including Barton Creek Resort and Spa, Horseshoe Bay Resort, TPC Las Colinas, The Woodlands Country Club, University of Texas Golf Club, The Traditions Club at Texas A&amp;M, and many more.\nCollege Golf.\nThis tour provides kids great exposure to college coaches not just from Texas, but from across the United States. As a result of this, TJGT has had more than 3300 TJGT graduates who have gone on to play collegiate golf. With obtaining collegiate golf scholarships as a main goal of the tour, the staff presses hard to give kids all the college exposure that they need. Signees have ranged from top ranked Oklahoma State to small NAIA and NJCAA schools. No matter the magnitude of the golf program at these schools, TJGT gave these players the opportunity they needed to allow them to play at the collegiate level.\nCompeting/Similar Tours.\nThe most competitive tour with TJGT is the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA). This is a national tour with 6 tournaments in Texas that draws the best of the best. Alumni of this tour include Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and Anthony Kim. For statewide tours, Texas Legends Junior Tour (TLJT) is the most competitive. The Legends Junior Tour has 12 golf tournaments throughout the state of Texas and is home to such prestigious events as the HP Byron Nelson Junior Championship, Texas Cup Invitational, Jackie Burke Cup, George Hannon Junior Invitational and Texas State Junior Championship."

They were the Metro Valley League's first ever champion in 1968. After a five-year hiatus, the Royals came back to help the Mainland Junior B Hockey League and since 1984 have been a prominent member of the league.\nThe Royals are one of three teams to have won the Don Johnson Cup as Maritime Junior B Champions 3 times. The other two are the Sackville Blazers and the St. John's Jr. 50's.\nIn 1998, the Royals were the Nova Scotia Junior B Champions. With the win, the Royals went to Summerside, Prince Edward Island to compete for the Don Johnson Cup. They made it all the way to the finals, where they met the New Brunswick Junior B Hockey League's Richibucto Bears and defeated them 4-2 to win their first Maritime Championship.\nIn 2001, the Royals were selected to be the host site of the Don Johnson Cup. As host site, they were allowed to compete in the competition despite not winning their league. They would go on to defeat their own league champion, the Strait Pirates, 3-1 in the championship game to win their second Maritime Junior B Championship.\nIn 2008, the Royals won their league and moved on to the Don Johnson Cup. In their first game, they lost to the St. John's Jr. Celtics 7-4. In Game 2, they then beat Dieppe-Memramcook Voyageurs (a Junior B team) from the New Brunswick Junior C Hockey League 6-3. Windsor then lost 4-3 to the Island Junior Hockey League's Kensington Vipers 4-3, but beat the host team Sherwood Falcons 6-2 in the same day. All five teams finished the round robin 2-2-0, but by virtue of goal differential the Royals finished first. On April 19, in the semi-final the Royals defeated Dieppe-Memramcook 3-1 and on April 20 they again beat Sherwood 4-1 to clinch their third Don Johnson Cup.\nIn 2012, the team took a one-year leave of absence, and did not make a return the following year. The Windsor Royals are now defunct. The Valley Maple Leafs though have filled their void and now play in the Town of Windsor in the same arena"

        "title": "Victorian Ice Hockey Association",
        "text": "The Victorian Ice Hockey Association, currently trading as Ice Hockey Victoria is the governing body of ice hockey in Victoria, Australia. The Victorian Ice Hockey Association is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nHistory.\nIce Hockey Victoria is the first ice hockey association formed in Australia. 12 September 1908 is the date of the formation of the first ice hockey association in Australia. The meeting at the Melbourne Glaciarium occurred directly after an evening ice hockey game between the Brighton Ice Hockey Club and the Melburnians, which resulted in a 2–2 tie. The meeting was for the purpose of organising a club for the following season and the following committee was appointed: Lorimer, Ward, Errol Forster Woods, Walter Purbrick and Andrew Lambert Reid. \nMr. Purbrick was nominated as honourable Treasurer and Mr. Reid was nominated as the Secretary.\nThe name of the association was the Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey Association (VAIHA). The association consisted of 4 ice hockey clubs: \nThe Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club was formed in 1907 and was the first ice hockey club to form in Australia and they are named for the Melbourne Glaciarium as the in house representative team. The remainder of the original 3 teams were formed in 1908. The Melburnians Ice Hockey Club consisted of the Melbourne Grammar School field hockey team and the team was named the Melburnians after the school. The Brighton Ice Hockey Club team were also named after a school, Brighton Grammar School. The Beavers Ice Hockey Club were named after their sponsor, Melbourne architect, Isidor George Beaver. The games were played in two 10-minute halves.\nThe School Club era.\nThe inaugural Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey Association season began with the first game being played at the Melbourne Glaciarium on the evening of 19 June 1909 between Brighton Ice Hockey Club and the Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club. The Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club would finish the regular season in first place and would be given the title of the minor premiers. The playoff format would then see the semi-finals have the first place Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club play the second place Melburnian Ice Hockey Club, who upset the minor premiers 3–1. The 3rd place Beavers Ice Hockey Club would be beaten by the 4th place Brighton Ice Hockey Club with a score of 5–3 and see the playoff championship be held between the Melburnian Ice Hockey Club and Brighton Ice Hockey Club. The Melburnian Ice Hockey Club would win convincingly 7–1. Due to finishing first during the regular season, which meant they were the 1909 season minor premiers, the Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club was able to issue a challenge to the Melburnian Ice Hockey Club for the \"Grand Challenge Championship\". This championship was held on the evening of 27 September 1909 and the Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club won by a score of 3–0 and were awarded gold medals.\nFor the 2nd season, the association ran under the auspices Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey and Sports Association and from the local competition, players would be selected to represent Victoria in the annual Inter-State Series. The first game of the season began at 9:00 pm at the Melbourne Glaciarium on 22 June 1910 between Beavers Ice Hockey Club and Brighton Ice Hockey Club resulting in a 5–3 win for Brighton. The playoff champions were the Melburnian Ice Hockey Club, who are seen posed with a trophy cup.\nIn 1911 the Melbourne Glaciarium was leased from 30 September that year, cutting the season shorter than usual, embracing 4 Ice Hockey clubs again. An ice hockey team was formed for girls and matches would begin for them every Saturday after the afternoon public skating session.\nThe 1912 season saw the addition of the Ottawa Ice Hockey Club in the absence of the Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club in the competition. Due to the season being short, it was necessary to play two games per night. The association would also now go by the name Victorian Ice Hockey Association. The Association would continue for another 2 years until the Great War.\nThe Great War.\nAs the Great War began, plans for the abandonment of ice hockey until the end of the war were considered. The rink management would go on to organise speed contests in the absence of a hockey season. No cup was to be contested in the 1915 season\nIn 1916, though the season was again cancelled, the Victorian Ice Hockey Association were considering younger players to fill the void left by many players at war. There was no certainty that ice hockey would be played.\nCompetition would resume in 1917 with a 2-team league consisting of the Beavers Ice Hockey Club and Ottawa Ice Hockey Club. The Melbourne Glaciarium management presented a trophy for the shortened competition. The premiership trophy was to be presented by Melbourne Glaciarium manager, Percy Watson, at the annual dinner. The Dinner was held at the Francatelli Cafe at 7:00 pm on 14 September 1917.\nThe Dinner was held at the Magpie Tea Rooms, Collins Street where the premiership cup was presented to Beaver Club captain Roy Marks.\nHockey players began to practice upon the opening of the ice skating season. A match was held between a Blues and Whites team during a carnival on 27 July 1918.\nIn 1920, the Melbourne Glaciarium did not operate an ice floor due to the popularity of dancing and was converted into a Palais de Dance. This meant that no ice hockey was played in Victoria, nor any ice sport played for this year.\nPost Great War Era.\nA cup was donated by John Edwin Goodall in 1921, not to be confused with the Goodall Cup used for the inter-state competition, this Goodall Cup was used as the premiership trophy for the Victorian Ice Hockey Association's ice hockey league.\nAs the ice hockey season opened for 1924, 5 men's ice hockey teams were formed and 1 women's team.\nThe Suburb Club era.\nIn the year Essendon won its first Premiership, earning the right to hold the Goodall Cup, they also held the first Presidents Cup donated by the Victorian Ice Hockey Association president Mr. P Sutherland.\nInter Rink Club era.\nWith the opening of the St. Moritz Ice Palais on 10 March 1939, a new strategy was to be made to allow the competition to make use of now having a second rink. This decision resulted in the disbanding of the current ice hockey teams and the formation of an ice hockey club at each rink, who would submit teams into the Victorian Ice Hockey Association season competition. On 19 April 1939, the Victorian Ice Hockey Association held a meeting to spread the competition across a second rink, with the St. Moritz Ice Palais officially opening a month before. The result of the meeting was that the Association decided that two new ice hockey clubs would be formed, one for the Melbourne Glaciarium and the other for the new St. Moritz Ice Palais, both clubs would seek affiliation with the VIHA. Between the two new ice hockey clubs they would provide four teams for the new 1939 VIHA season which would involve an inter-rink competition played between the Melbourne Glaciarium and St. Moritz Ice Palais. The St. Moritz Ice Hockey Club teams would be named the St. Moritz Bombers and the Smokey Bombers. The 3 existing VIHA teams would disband and join the new ice hockey clubs. Those teams were Essendon, Hawthorn and Brighton.\nThe 2 new ice hockey clubs would be named the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club and the Glaciarium Rangers Ice Hockey Club and they were coached by Mr. Fred Palmer and Mr. Hugh Lloyd. Instead of both clubs producing 2 teams for inter-rink competition as originally planned, they each submitted only 1 team into the competition. The teams to compete would be the St. Moritz Bombers and the Glaciarium Rangers.\nThe St. Moritz Ice Hockey Club would create its own inter-club \"house league\" season at St. Moritz Ice Palais by dividing into 2 teams that only played against each other . These teams were the St. Moritz Bombers and Foy's Gibsonia Flyers, who were sponsored by Foy &amp; Gibson.\nThe ice hockey season was scheduled to begin on 7 May 1940 with the first game of the St. Moritz Ice Hockey Club inter-club matches. Mr. Wallace Sharland was elected president of the Victorian Ice Hockey Association. On 29 April 1940 a meeting was held at Melbourne University and it was decided that they would form an Ice Hockey Club in hopes that inter-varsity games could be arranged with the Sydney University ice hockey club. The prospective ice hockey players would be coached by members of the Victorian Ice Hockey Association. The St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club created a new team called Rhodes' Topliners, who were sponsored by Rhodes Motor Company PTY LTD. They were to compete against the other sponsored team, Foy's Gibsonia Flyers, for their inter-club competition. A trophy was donated to the St. Moritz Ice Hockey Club inter-club season by Mr. O.T. Dixon\nInitial reports stated that ice hockey would be discontinued for the entirety of the 1941 season due to the activity of World War II but the Victorian Ice Hockey Association decided to continue the inter-rink competition. Enlistments had reduced the numbers for senior players but the focus on improving the standard of junior players would be relied upon to raise the senior competition standard. Each rink was still represented by an ice hockey club with the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club at St. Moritz Ice Palais and the Glaciarium Rangers Ice Hockey Club operating in the Melbourne Glaciarium. The combined membership between both clubs exceeded 100 players but key players would be subject to compulsory participation in World War II and enlistments. One such key player was Canadian Hugh Lloyd who became a member of the R.A.A.F. leaving a vacancy in the coaching role at the Glaciarium that veteran ice hockey player Alfred Massina would need to fill.\nDue to incidents that occurred in the inter-rink game between the St. Moritz Bombers and Glaciarium Rangers where fighting occurred between players which included involvement with spectators and 3 players being ordered off the ice, an ongoing ban continued to be in place against these 3 St. Moritz Bombers players from playing in the Melbourne Glaciarium. Before the season would start, the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club held a meeting on 25 May 1941 and decided that if the Melbourne Glaciarium management refused to lift the ban on these 3 players, the St. Moritz Bombers would not submit a team to compete against the Glaciarium Rangers in the inter-rink competition this year. Meanwhile, the Glaciarium Rangers Ice Hockey Club had decided to create their own house league and formed 4 new teams that would play exclusively at the Melbourne Glaciarium. These teams were: Collingwood, Hawthorn, South Melbourne and Essendon. The Victorian Ice Hockey Association held a meeting on 29 May 1941 with the managers of each ice rink to discuss the future plans for the inter-rink competition, while each rinks hockey club continued independently with their own house league season at their respective home rink. It was later confirmed just before the season that there would be no inter-rink competition for the 1941 season.\nOn 13 July 1941 A campaign was started to make ice hockey a popular sport in post war years, inviting juveniles between the ages of 12–14 to put on skates and receive coaching from senior members of the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club. Over 30 young people attended. \nWorld War II would result in the ceasing of regular ice hockey activity in Victoria for a few years, many players had enlisted and lost their lives while serving their country.\nInterstate competition.\n1909: The Inter-State Series.\nThe first inter-state ice hockey championship was held between a state representative team from Victoria and from New South Wales. This tournament was a best-of-3 format and saw Victoria win the series 2 games to 1. New South Wales was represented by a newly formed team in 1909 and travelled to Melbourne on 29 August 1909 which marked the first national interstate competition for senior men's hockey in Australia.\nThe first game of the series had a final score of 2–1 with New South Wales defeating Victoria. Friday 3 September 1909 the Victorian team defeated the New South Wales team 1–0, giving Victorian goaltender Charles Watt the first recorded shutout in the history of the Inter-State Series. In the third game of the series both teams had won a game each. Victoria defeated New South Wales 6–1 and became the first team to win the Inter-State Series in Australia.\nThe proprietors of the St. Moritz Ice Rink granted ice time to the Victorian Ice Hockey Association, free of charge to run a Lightning premiership for 8 B grade teams on 9 July 1954. All proceeds for the matches would go to the hockey association for the betterment and growth of the sport in Victoria.\n1922: The Gower Cup.\nThe first inter-state women's ice hockey championship tournament was held in the first week in August 1922 between New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales won the first game of the series 3–0.\nLeagues.\nFor the 2019 Season, Ice Hockey Victoria established 4 leagues:\nSenior Ice Hockey.\nThe primary competition for Ice Hockey Victoria takes place in the Winter Season.\nMinor Ice Hockey.\nThe 2019 Minor Hockey League consists of 3 age levels:\nWomen's Ice Hockey.\nEstablished independently and operating out of the Olympic Ice Skating Centre the Ice Hockey Victoria Women's League IHVWL now operates under Ice Hockey Victoria sanction.\nAwards and trophies.\nIce Hockey Victoria continues to present the original perpetual trophies for team and individual accomplishment for the season, the oldest award still presented today is the H.H. Kleiner Trophy which was first presented in 1946. Each level of hockey has its own playoff trophy as well as 4 individual trophies for: Season MVP, Highest Goal Scorer, Best Defenceman and Best Goaltender. In each case for individual awards, the original trophy is presented to the winner as well as a keeper trophy that they can take with them.\nH. H. Kleiner Memorial Trophy.\nThe H.H. Kleiner Memorial Trophy is a perpetual trophy awarded to the playoff champions of the Premier A level winter season competition for Ice Hockey Victoria.\nSince being awarded to the Western Suburbs in 1946 for its inaugural year, the trophy has always been awarded to the highest level of competition in Victoria, Australia. The trophy's namesake is Harry Hans Kleiner, the original proprietor of the St. Moritz Ice Palais. The H. H. Kleiner remains as the oldest Victorian state level competition trophy that is still contested and the original trophy is still being awarded and presented to the playoff champion of Victoria's highest level of state ice hockey to this day.\nHistory.\nWorld War II would result in the ceasing of regular ice hockey league activity in Victoria for a few years, many players had enlisted and lost their lives while serving their country. Leading up to the war time activity, enlistments had reduced the numbers for Victorian senior ice hockey players but the focus on improving the standard of junior players would be relied upon to raise the senior competition standard.\nBefore the war each rink was still represented by an ice hockey club with the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club at St. Moritz Ice Palais and the Glaciarium Rangers Ice Hockey Club operating in the Melbourne Glaciarium. The combined membership between both clubs exceeded 100 players but key players would be subject to compulsory participation in World War II and enlistments. One such key player was Canadian Hugh Lloyd who became a member of the R.A.A.F. leaving a vacancy in the coaching role at the Melbourne Glaciarium that veteran ice hockey player Alfred Massina would need to fill. The Victorian Ice Hockey Association held a meeting on 29 May 1941 with the managers of each ice rink to discuss the future plans for the inter-rink competition, while each rinks hockey club continued independently with their own house league season at their respective home rink. It was later confirmed just before the season that there would be no inter-rink competition for the 1941 season. On 13 July 1941 A campaign was started to make ice hockey a popular sport in post war years, inviting juveniles between the ages of 12–14 to put on skates and receive coaching from senior members of the St. Moritz Bombers Ice Hockey Club. Over 30 young people attended.\nFrom scrimmage sessions being held during the wartime activity, enough players would be available to form a league by 1946 consisting of 4 teams: Northern Suburbs, Southern Suburbs, Eastern Suburbs and Western Suburbs. This would be the first time in a few years that a league would exist but as the Melbourne Glaciarium did not operate an ice floor in 1946 due to the popularity of dancing, the 1946 competition would only operate inside Harry Hans Kleiner's St. Moritz Ice Palais and the modern era of club ice hockey would begin. Harry Hans Kleiner donated the trophy we know today as the H.H. Kleiner Trophy to the first champions, the Western Suburbs.\nTraditions and trophy history.\nDue to an alleged miscommunication between Ice Hockey Victoria executive in 2016 the Jets Ice Hockey Club won the playoff championship in two games, securing the H.H. Kleiner Trophy, but it was not brought to the venue by members of the Association, making this the first time in its history that the winning team was not presented the trophy after winning it.\nFor the 2018 IHV Winter season, the H.H. Kleiner trophy was refurbished, fixing the trophy that had become more fragile with time. Part of the work that was undertaken included a lengthening of the central brass cylinder to allow more champions to be inscribed on the award.\nBasil Hansen Memorial Trophy.\nThe Basil Hansen Memorial Trophy is currently awarded to the playoff champions in the Premier Reserve league. The trophy namesake is Basil Hansen, an Australian ice hockey champion.\nDon Reddish Trophy.\nThe Don Reddish trophy is currently awarded to the playoff champions in the Premier C division I\nClive Connelly Trophy.\nThe Clive Connelly Trophy is currently awarded to the playoff champions in the Premier C division II"

Grace played in 31 matches in the 1895 English cricket season, 29 of which are recognised as first-class.\nBackground.\nAgainst all expectation, Grace produced in 1895 a season that has been called his \"Indian Summer\". He completed his hundredth century playing for Gloucestershire against Somerset in May. Charles Townsend, his batting partner when he reached the milestone, said that as he approached his hundred: \"This was the one and only time I ever saw him flustered...\" Eventually Sammy Woods bowled a full toss which Grace drove for four to reach his century. He then went on to score 1,000 runs in the month, the first time this had ever been done, with scores of 13, 103, 18, 25, 288, 52, 257, 73 not out, 18 and 169 totalling 1,016 runs between 9 and 30 May. His aggregate for the whole season was 2,346 at an average of 51.00 with nine centuries. He was aged forty-seven at the start of the season and forty-eight by its end.\nGrace made 29 first-class appearances in 1895, scoring 2,346 runs, with a highest score of 288, at an average of 51.00 with 9 centuries and 5 half-centuries. In the field, he took 31 catches and 16 wickets with a best analysis of 5–87. His bowling average was 32.93; he had 5 wickets in an innings once.\nFollowing his \"Indian Summer\", Grace was the sole recipient of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year award for 1896, the first of only three times that \"Wisden\" has restricted the award to a single player, there being normally five recipients.\nFootnote.\n• a) As described in Grace's first-class career statistics, there are different versions of Grace's first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians re the status of some matches he played in. Note that this is a statistical issue only and has little, if any, bearing on the historical aspects of Grace's career.

        "title": "W. G. Grace's cricket career (1896 to 1899)",
        "text": "Following his \"Indian Summer\" in 1895, W.G. Grace continued to play first-class cricket through his fiftieth birthday in 1898 and finally severed his connections with both Gloucestershire and England in 1899.\nBackground.\nAn oft-repeated story about Grace is that, in 1896, the Australian pace bowler Ernie Jones bowled a short-pitched delivery so close to his face that it appeared to go through the famous beard which made him so instantly recognisable. Grace reportedly reacted by demanding of Australian captain Harry Trott: \"Here, what's all this?\" Trott said to Jones: \"Steady, Jonah\". To which Jones laconically replied: \"Sorry, doctor, she slipped\". There are multiple variations of the story and, although some sources have recorded that the incident happened in a Test match, there is little doubt that the game in question was the tour opener at Sheffield Park. This is separately confirmed by C.B. Fry and Stanley Jackson who were both playing in the match, Jackson batting with Grace at the time.\nGrace made 30 first-class appearances in 1896, scoring 2,135 runs, with a highest score of 301, at an average of 42.70 with 4 centuries and 11 half-centuries. In the field, he took 18 catches and 52 wickets with a best analysis of 7–59. His bowling average was 24.01; he had 5 wickets in an innings 3 times and 10 wickets in a match once.\nGrace made 25 first-class appearances in 1897, scoring 1,532 runs, with a highest score of 131, at an average of 39.28 with 4 centuries and 7 half-centuries. In the field, he took 15 catches and 56 wickets with a best analysis of 6–36. His bowling average was 22.17; he had 5 wickets in an innings 4 times.\nBy the time of his fiftieth birthday in July 1898, Grace had developed a somewhat corpulent figure and had lost his former agility, which meant he was no longer a capable fielder. He remained a very good batsman and at need a useful slow bowler, but he was clearly entering the twilight of his career and was now generally referred to as \"The Old Man\". As a special occasion, the MCC committee arranged the 1898 Gentlemen v Players match to coincide with his fiftieth birthday and he celebrated the event by scoring 43 and 31 not out, though handicapped by lameness and an injured hand.\nGrace made 26 first-class appearances in 1898, scoring 1,513 runs, with a highest score of 168, at an average of 42.02 with 3 centuries and 8 half-centuries. In the field, he took 20 catches and 36 wickets with a best analysis of 7–44. His bowling average was 25.41; he had 5 wickets in an innings 3 times and 10 wickets in a match once.\nGrace had received an invitation from the Crystal Palace Company in London to help them form the London County Cricket Club. Grace accepted the offer and became the club's secretary, manager and captain with an annual salary of £600. As a result, he severed his connection with Gloucestershire during the 1899 season.\nGrace captained England in the First Test of the 1899 series against Australia at Trent Bridge, when he was 51. By this time his bulk had made him a liability in the field and, afterwards, realising his limitations all too clearly, he decided to stand down and surrendered both his place and the captaincy to Archie MacLaren. It is evident that Grace \"plotted\" his own omission from the England team by asking C.B. Fry, another selector who had arrived late for their meeting, if he thought that MacLaren should play in the Second Test. Fry answered: \"Yes, I do.\" \"That settles it\", said Grace, and he promptly retired from international cricket. Explaining his decision later, Grace ruefully admitted of his diminished fielding skills that \"the ground was getting a bit too far away\".\nGrace last played at Lord's for the Gentlemen in 1899 though he continued to represent the team at other venues until 1906.\nGrace made 13 first-class appearances in 1899, scoring 515 runs, with a highest score of 78, at an average of 23.40 with 0 centuries and 3 half-centuries. In the field, he took 7 catches and 20 wickets with a best analysis of 5–86. His bowling average was 24.10; he had 5 wickets in an innings once.\nFootnote.\n• a) As described in Grace's first-class career statistics, there are different versions of Grace's first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians re the status of some matches he played in.

        "title": "W. G. Grace's cricket career (1900 to 1908)",
        "text": "W.G. Grace was mainly associated with the new London County Cricket Club during this period. His first-class career ended in 1908 when he was nearly 60.\nBackground.\nHaving ended his international career, Grace then began the last phase of his overall first-class career when he joined the new London County Cricket Club, based at Crystal Palace Park, which played first-class matches between 1900 and 1904. Grace's presence initially attracted other leading players into the team, including Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Johnny Douglas, but the increased importance of the County Championship, combined with Grace's inevitable decline in form and the lack of a competitive element in London's matches, led to reduced attendances and consequently the club lost money. Nevertheless, Grace remained an attraction and could still produce good performances. As late as 1902, though aged 54 by the end of the season, he scored 1187 runs in first-class cricket, with two centuries, at an average of 37.09. But London's final first-class matches were played in 1904 and the enterprise folded in 1908.\nGrace made 19 first-class appearances in 1900, scoring 1,277 runs, with a highest score of 126, at an average of 42.56 with 3 centuries and 8 half-centuries. In the field, he took 6 catches and 32 wickets with a best analysis of 5–66. His bowling average was 30.28; he had 5 wickets in an innings 3 times.\nGrace made 19 first-class appearances in 1901, scoring 1,007 runs, with a highest score of 132, at an average of 32.48 with 1 century and 7 half-centuries. In the field, he took 7 catches and 51 wickets with a best analysis of 7–30. His bowling average was 21.78; he had 5 wickets in an innings 5 times and 10 wickets in a match once.\nGrace made 22 first-class appearances in 1902, scoring 1,187 runs, with a highest score of 131, at an average of 37.09 with 2 centuries and 7 half-centuries. In the field, he took 6 catches and 46 wickets with a best analysis of 5–29. His bowling average was 23.34; he had 5 wickets in an innings 4 times.\nGrace made 16 first-class appearances in 1903, scoring 593 runs, with a highest score of 150, at an average of 22.80 with 1 centuries and 1 half-century. In the field, he took 5 catches and 10 wickets with a best analysis of 6–102. His bowling average was 47.90; he had 5 wickets in an innings once.\nGrace made 15 first-class appearances in 1904, scoring 637 runs, with a highest score of 166, at an average of 25.48 with 1 century and 3 half-centuries. In the field, he took 2 catches and 21 wickets with a best analysis of 6–78. His bowling average was 32.71; he had 5 wickets in an innings once.\nWith the demise of London County, the number of Grace's appearances dwindled over the next four seasons until he made his final appearance in first-class cricket in 1908. He made 9 first-class appearances in 1905, scoring 250 runs, with a highest score of 71, at an average of 19.23 with just the one half-century. In the field, he took 2 catches and 7 wickets with a best analysis of 4–121. His bowling average was 54.71.\nGrace's final appearance for the Gentlemen versus the Players was in July 1906 at The Oval. He made only five first-class appearances that season, scoring 241 runs, with a highest score of 74, at an average of 26.77 with 2 half-centuries. In the field, he took 4 catches and 13 wickets with a best analysis of 4–71. His bowling average was 20.61.\nHe made only one appearance in 1907, scoring 16 and 3 in his two innings. He took no catches and did not bowl.\nGrace made his final first-class appearance on 20–22 April 1908 for the Gentlemen of England v Surrey at The Oval, where, opening the innings, he scored 15 and 25. This was his sole appearance in 1908.\nFootnote.\n• a) As described in Grace's first-class career statistics, there are different versions of Grace's first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians re the status of some matches he played in.

        "text": "The Stanford rugby teams of 1906 to 1917 represented Stanford University as the school's only football program during those years, replacing American football with rugby union. The school had played American football from 1892 to 1905, but in 1906, concerned with the growing levels of violence in football, Stanford and other universities changed to rugby. Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby, during which it played other college teams, club teams from the United States, Canada, and Australia, as well as the New Zealand national team and Australia national team. Despite the team's success, it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers, and after rival California returned to football in 1915, Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I, the school returned to American football in 1919.\nSwitch to rugby.\nAmerican football in the early 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 serious injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.\nReform was demanded by such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried the brutality and foul play of the game, and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue. As a result, before the next season began, new rules were put in place to discourage such play. The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.\nSeveral universities on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, replaced the sport with rugby. At the time, the future of football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.\nReturn to football.\nIn 12 seasons of rugby, Stanford was remarkably successful: the team had three undefeated seasons, three one-loss seasons, and an overall record of 94 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816. However, after a few years, the school began to feel the isolation of its newly adopted sport, which was not spreading as many had hoped. Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to football to allow wider intercollegiate competition. The pressure at rival California was stronger (especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped), and in 1915 California returned to football. As reasons for the change, the school cited football rule changes, the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play football, interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools, and a patriotic desire to play an \"American\" game.\nCalifornia's return to football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry. Stanford played its 1915, 1916, and 1917 \"Big Games\" as rugby against Santa Clara and California's football \"Big Game\" in those years was against Washington, but both schools desired to restore the old traditions. The onset of World War I gave Stanford an out: in 1918, the Stanford campus was designated as the Students' Army Training Corps headquarters for all of California, Nevada, and Utah, and the commanding officer, Sam M. Parker, decreed that football was the appropriate athletic activity to train soldiers and rugby was dropped.\nAfter the war, Stanford resumed its football program and relegated rugby to a minor sport. Several Stanford rugby players who played during those years—including Daniel Carroll, Dink Templeton, Morris Kirksey, Erwin Righter, John Patrick, and Charles Doe—went on to win a gold medal for the United States in rugby at the 1920 Summer Olympics.\nSeason results.\n1906 season.\nIn its first season of rugby, Stanford retained head football coach James F. Lanagan as its first rugby coach. Lanagan had coached the football team for three years, including an undefeated 1905 season. With no experience playing or coaching rugby, Lanagan initially offered his resignation, but Stanford insisted he stay on, so he traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to study the sport. Stanford won its first five games, including two wins over a visiting club team from Vancouver. As winners of the first Big Game against California played as rugby, Stanford competed against Vancouver-area club teams for the Cooper Keith Trophy, losing two games and tying one.\n1907 season.\nIn Stanford's second season of rugby, Jimmy Lanagan returned as coach and the team finished 8–4. Stanford continued its series with Nevada, Vancouver, and Victoria and added games against Bay Area club team the Barbarians and a Los Angeles club called the Castaways. Stanford won its second Big Game rugby match, earning a second straight tournament in British Columbia.\n1908 season.\nLanagan returned for his final year as Stanford's coach and the team finished 12–2, winning not only its third consecutive Big Game, but also going on to win the Cooper Keith Trophy in the end-of-season Vancouver tournament. Stanford added two games against San Francisco's Olympic Club and played a final game against the Australian national team, the Wallabies.\n1909 season.\nFollowing Lanagan's departure, George Presley was named Stanford's new rugby coach. Presley played one year of rugby under Lanagan in 1906 and had been an assistant coach in 1907 and 1908. Presley also coached Stanford's baseball team. Stanford won its first eight games—seven by shutout—but then lost Big Game for the first time in seven years.\n1910 season.\nIn Presley's second year as coach, Stanford was led by Ben Erb and Jim Arrell. The season was almost identical to the previous year: the team won its first seven games by shutout, and then lost Big Game to undefeated California. Stanford led in that game 6–0, but did not score again as California won 25–6. This Big Game is recognized as the first intercollegiate game to feature card stunts.\n1911 season.\nIn the 1911 season, Stanford went 10–3 and added USC to the schedule, as the school dropped football in favor of rugby.\n1912 season.\nIn Presley's last year as coach, Stanford finished with a 5–3–1 record, its worst record of the rugby era. Stanford avoided a fourth straight loss in the Big Game by tying California. Despite an outstanding 30–8–1 overall record as coach, coach Presley was 0–3–1 against the Bears.\n1913 season.\nFloyd C. Brown succeeded George Presley as coach. Like Presley, Brown had played for and served as an assistant under the previous coach. Stanford finished with an 8–3 record, including its first Big Game win in five years, led by Danny Carroll, who had won a gold medal in the 1908 Summer Olympics as a member of the Australia national rugby union team and who was now earning a degree in geology from Stanford. Stanford played its final rugby game against USC, who returned to American football the next year, and suffered two blowout losses to the famed New Zealand All Blacks, who were on a North American tour.\n1914 season.\nBrown's second year as coach was the best in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated entering the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This would be the last Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.\n1915 season.\nBy 1915, there was only one other U.S. college playing intercollegiate rugby: Santa Clara. The rest of Stanford's schedule was made up of local club and all star teams. The team played to a scoreless tie with the Olympic Club team to start the season, but recovered to win the rest of the games on the schedule.\n1916 season.\nIn their last full season of rugby, Stanford won all its games except the \"Big Game\" against Santa Clara, played for the second year at Ewing Field in San Francisco. This was Stanford's first loss since 1913.\n1917 season.\nLike the two coaches before him, Stanford's new head coach Jim Wylie was a former Stanford player. He had also been a member of the New Zealand All Blacks team that had crushed Stanford's team in 1913. But with World War I imminent, Stanford played just one game, the \"Big Game\" against Santa Clara, winning 15–11. This was also Stanford rugby's last game as a major sport. The following year, Stanford president Ray Lyman Wilbur canceled all intercollegiate athletic events due to students' enlisting in the military for the war, and due to Stanford's designation as the regional headquarters of the Students' Army Training Corps. When Stanford reformed a team in 1919, the school returned to American football as its major gridiron sport."

        "title": "Derek Grant (ice hockey, born 1990)",
        "text": "Derek Grant (born April 20, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey center for ZSC Lions of the National League (NL).\nAfter being drafted in the 4th round (119th overall) of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators, Grant played with the NCAA Division I collegiate ice hockey with the Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team from 2009 to 2011. During this time, he earned numerous CCHA honors including being an Honorable Mention for the CCHA All-Rookie Team. Following his sophomore season, Grant joined the Senators organization and was assigned to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, to finish out the 2010–11 season. During this time, he helped the Senators in their 2011 Calder Cup playoffs push and won a Calder Cup.\nEarly life.\nGrant was born on April 20, 1990, in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada to parents Debi and Dean Grant.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nGrowing up in Abbotsford, Grant began playing ice hockey with his hometown Abbotsford Hawks atom team. During his time with the team, he helped them win silver in a 2002 Coquitlam tournament and was also named MVP. Once aging out of atoms, Grant went undrafted during the Western Hockey Leagues Bantam Draft due his short stature and subsequently joined the South East Flames of the B.C. Major Midget League. In his first season with the Flames, Grant broke his arm in November 2007 and missed significant time. However, he endured a growth spurt while recovering and returned standing at six-foot-three and weighing 180 pounds.\nFollowing his growth spurt, Grant was recruited by the Junior B Abbotsford Pilots to try out for the team for the 2006–07 season. Upon making the roster, Grant led the team with 31 goals through 47 games. As such, he was scouted by the Swift Current Broncos and the Moose Jaw Warriors of the WHL but chose to commit to Michigan State University (MSU). During his breakout rookie season, Grant scored a hat-trick, including the game-winning goal, with 40 seconds left and was named the player of the game. Following the 2006–07 season with the Pilots, Grant played junior hockey with the Langley Chiefs of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). After tallying 21 goals and 30 assists by January, he was named to the Coastal Conference in the BCHL All-Star Game and ranked 103rd amongst all North American skaters eligible for the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nOnce the 2007–08 season was concluded, Grant had recorded 24 goals and 63 points in his rookie season and was drafted 119th overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. Following the draft, Grant returned to Langley for one more season before beginning his freshman season at MSU.\nCollegiate.\nGrant played NCAA Division I collegiate ice hockey with the Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey team from 2009 to 2011. Upon joining the Spartans as a freshman, Grant played on their top line with Corey Tropp and Nick Sucharski. On October 12, 2009, Grant was honored as the CCHA Rookie of the Week after he had tied the national lead in rookie scoring and in points per game, goals, and power-play points. At the conclusion of October, Grant was recognized by the CCHA as their Rookie of the Month after he tallied four goals and six assists through 10 games. This earned him praise from the Spartans head coach who called him a \"complete player\" and someone who is \"more of a distributor of the puck than a guy who puts in 20 shots a night on goal.\" Grant concluded his rookie season with the Spartans third on the team in goals and tied for fourth in assists with 12 and 18 respectively. His play earned him Honorable Mention honors for the CCHA All-Rookie Team.\nGrant returned to the Spartans for his sophomore campaign where he played alongside Brett Perlini and Zach Golembiewski. His second season did not start out as successfully as his freshman season as he went scoreless in his first eight games of the season. He eventually scored his first goal of the season in mid November during a five-point weekend against Ohio State University. As a result of the four assists and one goal in one weekend, Grant was the recipient of the CCHA Offensive Player of the Week honor on November 15, 2010.\nProfessional.\nOttawa Senators.\nFollowing his sophomore season at Michigan State, Grant chose to leave MSU and signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Senators on March 10, 2011. He was immediately assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, for the remainder of the season and 2011 Calder Cup playoffs push. Upon joining the Binghamton Senators, Grant earned his first professional career point with an assist in a 3–1 win over the Charlotte Checkers. He then scored the game-winning goal in overtime to tie their best-of-seven Atlantic Division series with the Manchester Monarchs. Grant helped the Senators overcame the Monarchs, the Portland Pirates, and the Checkers en route to the Calder Cup final, where they eliminated the Houston Aeros in six games.\nGrant was invited to participate with the Ottawa Senators in the NHL's rookie tournament prior to the 2011–12 season where he played on the starting line alongside Corey Cowick and Stefan Noesen. Following the tournament, Grant was selected to participate in the Senators training camp but was returned to the AHL for the start of the season. He remained in the AHL for the entirety of the season where he tallied 23 points through 60 games.\nOn February 16, 2013, Grant made his NHL debut in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He played in a total of five games before being reassigned to the AHL. Following his second full professional season, Grant was again invited to participate with the Ottawa Senators training camp prior to the start of the 2013–14 season. On July 10, 2014, Grant signed a one-year two-way contract extension with the Senators.\nCalgary Flames.\nAs Grant was not offered a new contract by the Senators, he signed a one-year contract with the Calgary Flames on July 1, 2015, as a free agent. Grant later stated that he chose to join the Flames organization due to their young core group. He attended the Flames' training camp but was re-assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Stockton Heat, prior to the start of the 2015–16 season. He was quickly recalled to the NHL level however after Micheal Ferland suffered an injury. Grant played in nine games for Calgary before being re-assigned to the AHL on November 16.\nBy January, Grant led the team in scoring with 16 goals and 20 points which included his 11 points in 11 games during December. Grant also recorded 51 shots on net in December, including an 11-shot effort during a 3-2 loss to the Bakersfield Condors.\nAs a result of his overall play, Grant was chosen to represent the Heat at the 2016 AHL All-Star Game. Upon returning from the All-Star Game, Grant continued to generate offense and netted two goals and six points through two games. He finished the month with 10 goals and 9 assists for 19 points through 10 games. His efforts were recognized with the AHL Player Of The Month for January honor. Within the following two months, Grant missed numerous games to recover from a broken jaw but returned to the Heat's lineup and scored five points through two games.\nDue to various injuries in the Flames' lineup, Grant and three other teammates were recalled to the NHL level on March 28, 2016. In his first game back with the Flames, he recorded his first career NHL point during their 5–2 win over the Arizona Coyotes. Upon returning to the AHL, Grant was named the Heat's Most Valuable Player, Offensive Player Of The Year, and this season's Fan Favourite.\nBuffalo Sabres and Nashville Predators.\nOn July 2, 2016, Grant signed a one-year two-way contract as a free agent with the Buffalo Sabres. After a successful training camp and pre-season with the Sabres, he made the opening night roster to begin the 2016–17 season. Grant appeared in 35 games with the Sabres, and tallied three assists, before being claimed by the Nashville Predators on January 11, 2017. He played six games with the Predators before being picked up by the Sabres after being waived. Upon being picked up, he was immediately assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans.\nAlthough he was re-assigned to the AHL, Grant was quickly recalled to the NHL level a few days later due to various injuries. When speaking about the call-up, head coach Dan Bylsma said: \"[Grant] being able to take draws in the pivot position would be an opportunity to use more of a four-line rotation...with Zemgus going out, [we're] definitely looking for a penalty killer to go into our lineup.\" A few weeks later, Grant suffered a shoulder injury during a game against the Colorado Avalanche and missed numerous games to recover. He was re-assigned to the AHL on February 24 while Justin Bailey and Evan Rodrigues were recalled in his place.\nGrant played out the rest of the season with the Americans and regained his scoring touch by contributing 19 points through 23 games. He began by scoring his first goal since March 26, 2016, to lift the team to a 4–3 win over the Toronto Marlies on March 8, 2017. Following this, Grant scored six goals over three games to help the Americans rank sixth in the North Division with 56 points.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nAs a result of his play during the 2016–17 season, Grant signed a one-year, one-way deal on the second day of free agency with the Anaheim Ducks. With the Ducks suffering through early injuries at training camp, Grant made the opening night roster for the 2017–18 season. Upon joining the Ducks' lineup, Grant appeared to score his first goal on October 11 against the Vancouver Canucks before it was called back due to it being ruled offside. He officially recorded his first two NHL goals a few games later on October 20 against the Montreal Canadiens. Grant continued to produce offensively and quickly tied his career-high four points in a single season by late October. Grant added an initial offensive presence with the Ducks and was moved between the first and fourth lines due to various injuries. Grant surprised the coaching staff with his play while on the top line but struggled to remain on the ice and was a healthy scratch 13 times over a six-week period. He eventually found his role on the Ducks' third-line and responded by producing a career-high 12 goals, 12 assists, and 24 points through 66 games.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nHaving played his first full season in the NHL, Grant left the Ducks as a free agent and agreed to a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 20, 2018. After attending the Penguins training camp and pre-season, Grant made the Penguins opening night roster to begin the 2018-19 season. However, his stint in the NHL was shortlived as he was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, to accommodate Tristan Jarry's promotion after scoring in one game. He spent a total of 25 games with the Penguins while filling a bottom-six role but was overshadowed by the Penguins’ depth at center. At the AHL level, Grant played in five games with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton over two different assignments where he tallied four points.\nOn January 16, 2019, Grant was returned to the Anaheim Ducks after a trade with the Penguins in exchange for Joseph Blandisi.\nReturn to Anaheim and Philadelphia Flyers.\nUpon rejoining the Ducks for the remainder of the 2018–19 season, Grant contributed two goals and nine points through 31 games. At the end of the season, Grant was re-signed by the Ducks to a one-year $700,000 contract extension. In the following 2019–20 season, Grant established a career high 14 goals through 49 games with the Ducks, including recording his first career NHL hat-trick. Despite this, he was dealt at the NHL trade deadline to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Kyle Criscuolo and a 2020 fourth-round pick on February 24, 2020. Grant posted five points through his first seven games with the Flyers before the season was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the pause in play, Grant had a difficult time finding rinks available for him to practice and train with numerous teammates. He eventually returned to help the Flyers in the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs where they swept the Boston Bruins, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference seeding round-robin. Following this, Grant helped the Flyers beat the Montreal Canadiens in six games to moved onto the Eastern Conference semi-finals against the New York Islanders. While the Flyers were eliminated in the semi-finals, Grant finished the post-season with two assists through 15 games.\nAs a free agent, Grant opted to return for a third stint with the Anaheim Ducks, securing a three-year, $4.5 million contract on October 9, 2020.\nZSC Lions.\nHaving concluded his three-year contract with the Ducks, Grant left the club as a free agent and opted to sign his first contract abroad by agreeing to a one-year deal with Swiss based, ZSC Lions of the NL, on July 20, 2023.\nInternational play.\nAs a native of Canada, Grant was chosen to represent Team Canada West at the 2008 World Junior A Challenge where he helped them win a silver medal."

        "text": "Super Bowl Sunday is the day on which the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played. It was the first Sunday in February from Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 until Super Bowl LV in 2021, but is now the second Sunday, beginning with Super Bowl LVI. Festivities typically involve groups of people gathering to watch the game.\nFestivities.\nAlthough not an official holiday, many families and friends gather together to watch the game, including those who are not normally football fans. Although sports bars have been busy in the past, it is becoming more common for people to watch the game from home due to the increasing size of televisions as well as to save money.\nBecause watching the Super Bowl is so popular, stores are often empty of shoppers during the game, particularly in the regions represented by the two teams playing, and water usage drops, with significant rises in use during halftime and after the game, as fans use the bathroom. Churches sometimes cancel afternoon or evening services, hold football-themed charity drives, or deliver sermons designed to appeal to male members of the congregation.\nNFL executives have called for a three-day weekend in order to allow fans to celebrate the event, and there is thought to be a loss of productivity in the American work force on Monday after the event. The television network carrying the game (either CBS, Fox, ABC, or NBC) will usually devote the entire day's programming schedule to the game, with extended pregame shows, NFL Films retrospectives of the previous season, and special versions of the Sunday morning talk shows in the morning and afternoon hours leading into the game. Competing networks, due to the severe loss of viewers to the Super Bowl festivities and a gentlemen's agreement not to compete against the game (most cable and broadcast networks are owned by a limited number of companies, most of which hold NFL rights), generally resort to low-cost counterprogramming measures like the \"Puppy Bowl.\"\nAlternative football leagues have, especially since the Pro Bowl moved to the week before the Super Bowl, frequently begun their seasons the weekend following Super Bowl Sunday to capitalize on football fans seeking more football after the end of the NFL season. Examples include the Arena Football League from 2002 to 2006, Alliance of American Football in 2019, Fan Controlled Football in 2021, and all incarnations of the XFL to date, including 2001, 2020 and 2023.\nFood.\nLarge amounts of food and alcohol are consumed. It is the second-largest food consumption event in the United States, behind Thanksgiving dinner, and some police departments have noticed a dramatic increase in drunk driving.\nFood is usually served buffet style, rather than as a sit-down meal. Foods traditionally eaten include buffalo wings, chili, baby back ribs, dipping sauces, pizza, and potato chips. Many pizza delivery businesses see their order numbers double and of chips, 1.25 billion chicken wings and of guacamole are consumed."

        "text": "The 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event took place between January 10 and January 18, 2012. The event featured the artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and trampoline disciplines. It qualified the last four artistic gymnastics teams for the 2012 Olympic Games, along with 34 individual female gymnasts and 27 individual male gymnasts selected through the all-around competition. Teams that finished 17th to 24th at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were able to take two individuals to the test event. Teams that finished 1st to 8th were invited to send two individual gymnasts, but they were not candidates for individual spots.\nThe rhythmic gymnastics event, too, qualified four teams for the 2012 Olympic Games. Teams that finished 7th to 12th and the champion of the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships—along with the host nation of the test event, Great Britain—were invited participants, although the champion had already qualified for the Olympics. Because the world champion, Italy, decided not to attend, Azerbaijan, which placed 13th at the 2011 World Championships, was invited as a replacement. The test event also qualified five individual gymnasts for the Olympics. Twenty teams were invited to send one gymnast each according to their results at the 2011 World Championships. The host, Great Britain, could send one as well. The three medalists of the Championships were also invited despite their previous qualification to the Olympic Games. As two of the three medalists were not joining, two more teams were invited to send one gymnast apiece to the event.\nIn the trampolining event, seven individual competitors qualified for each of the Olympic events. These competitors were from countries that had not succeeded in qualifying an individual at the 2011 Trampoline World Championships.\nThe event was part of the London Prepares series of test events and took place at the 2012 Olympic venue, the O2 Arena.\nArtistic Gymnastics.\nMen.\nIndividuals.\n2 Gymnasts\n1 Gymnast\nTeam Final.\nThe Team Final happened on January 10.

Team Brazil placed 4th (217,985) and also qualified for 2012 Olympic Games.\nVault.\nMexico's Elsa García also qualified to the vault final, but was injured during warmups and pulled out at the last moment. Because Garcia withdrew so soon before the competition, first alternate Yamilet Peña of the Dominican Republic did not have adequate time to warm up. Ergo, the vault final contained only seven gymnasts.\nRhythmic Gymnastics.\nResults of Qualifying and Final Competitions.\nIndividual all-around.\nTeam all-around.\nQualification.\nThe top 4 teams in the qualification event qualified for the 2012 Olympics.\nTrampoline.\nResults of Qualifying and Final Competitions"

        "text": "The 2011–12 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season began with practices in October 2015, followed by the start of the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season in November. The season marked the first season of participation of the Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team in Big Ten competition. With the addition of Nebraska, all teams will play seven other teams twice and four teams once during the conference schedule, which continues to be 18 games. The season commenced on October 14 when Michigan State and Minnesota celebrated Midnight Madness and three more conference schools hosted events on the 15th. For the fifth consecutive season, all conference games were broadcast nationally with eight aired by CBS Sports, 36 carried by the ESPN Inc. family of networks including ESPN and ESPN2, while 64 games were carried by the Big Ten Network. The conference led the nation in attendance for the 36th consecutive season.\nThe regular season ended with Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State tied for the league championship. Wisconsin finished in second place.\nMichigan State's Draymond Green was named the Conference Player of the Year. Michigan State's Tom Izzo was named conference Coach of the Year.\nBankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana hosted the Big Ten tournament from March 8–March 11. Michigan State defeated Ohio State in the championship game to win the tournament championship. Draymond Green was also named tournament MVP. As a result, the Spartans received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Six teams (Indiana, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue, and Wisconsin) received invitations to the NCAA tournament. The conference had an 11–6 record in the Tournament, with Indiana, Michigan State, Ohio State, and Wisconsin reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Ohio State advanced to the Final Four.

The conference had a 6–3 record with Minnesota losing in the championship game.\nPreseason.\nThree teams were ranked in the preseason USA Today/ESPN poll: Ohio State (No. 3), Wisconsin (No. 14) and Michigan (No. 18), while Michigan State and Purdue were also receiving votes. The Big Ten Basketball Media Day for men's and women's basketball was October 27 in Chicago.

Craft was named to the first team, Crawford to the second team and Novak to the third team, giving the Big Ten three Academic All-Americans, which was more than any other conference.\nConference honors.\nTwo sets of conference award winners were recognized by the Big Ten - one selected by league coaches and one selected by the media.\nThe leading scorer for the year was John Shurna with an average of 20.0 and the leading rebounder was Draymond Green with an average of 10.6.\nNABC.\nThe National Association of Basketball Coaches announced their Division I All‐District teams on March 14, recognizing the nation’s best men’s collegiate basketball student-athletes. Selected and voted on by member coaches of the NABC, 240 student-athletes, from 24 districts were chosen. The selection on this list were then eligible for the State Farm Coaches’ Division I All-America teams. The following list represented the Big Ten players chosen to the list. Since the Big Ten Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named All-Big Ten by the NABC.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nUSBWA.\nOn March 6, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association released its 2011–12 Men's All-District Teams, based upon voting from its national membership. There were nine regions from coast to coast, and a player and coach of the year were selected in each. The following lists all the Big Ten representatives selected within their respective regions.\nDistrict II (NY, NJ, DE, DC, PA, WV)\nNone Selected\nDistrict V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI)\nPlayer of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nAll-District Team\nDistrict VI (IA, MO, KS, OK, NE, ND, SD)\nNone Selected\nNational postseason honors.\nSullinger and Green were first team 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans by The \"Sporting News\", while Zeller was a member of their All-Freshman team.

Trey Burke, Robbie Hummel, Jordan Taylor, John Shurna, and Cody Zeller were honorable mention selections. Hummel was named the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award winner. Aaron Craft won the Elite 89 Award. Green was named the NABC Player of the Year. 41 men's basketball players in their second year or beyond earned Academic All-Big Ten recognition for carrying a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher.\nCBSSports.com used a modified selection process that resulted in Green being named a first team All-American, while Sullinger and Burke were second team selections. The process derided the traditional basketball All-American process of naming the best players and was modelled on the All-Pro or NHL All-Star team formula of choosing the best players by position. Shurna was also selected to participate in the NABC 2012 Reese's Division I All-Star Game at the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament final four.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Big Ten had six teams in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament: Michigan State earned the automatic bid and a number 1 seed, while Indiana (2 seed), Michigan (4 seed), Ohio State (4 seed), Purdue (4 seed), Wisconsin (10 seed). With 5 top-4-seeded teams, the Big Ten tied the tournament record since seeding began in 1979. The Big Ten matched its conference best and for 2012 national lead with four Sweet Sixteen participants (Indiana, Michigan State, Ohio State Wisconsin) and was the only conference with multiple entrants to have half its teams make the Elite Eight round. Ohio State achieved its conference leading 10th final four.\nNational Invitation Tournament.\nAll three Big Ten entrants in the 2012 National Invitation Tournament won their opening games and Minnesota reached the championship game before losing.\nOther tournaments.\nThe Big Ten did not have any entrants in the other post season tournaments.\n2012 NBA draft.\nThe following Big Ten players were drafted in the 2012 NBA draft.\nPre-draft trades.\nPrior to the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams."

The team competes in the National Cricket League (NCL). Their home venue is the Rangpur Cricket Garden in Rangpur City. Rangpur are a recent addition to the NCL, having joined in 2011–12, and won their first title in 2014–15. The equivalent team in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) is the Rangpur Riders.\nHistory.\nRangpur Division was formed on 25 January 2010, as Bangladesh's seventh administrative division. Before that, the territory had been the northern eight districts of the Rajshahi Division and the new Rangpur division consists of the same eight districts. As the National Cricket League has always been based on the administrative divisions, it was decided to invite a Rangpur team and so increase the competition's membership from the existing six. In order to keep the membership an even number, the NCL also invited Dhaka Metropolis to join. The two new teams made their NCL debuts in the 2011–12 season. In the 2014–15 season, Rangpur won their first NCL championship in a last-ball finish on the final day of the competition.\nAt the end of the 2017-18 competition Rangpur Division had played, in seven seasons, a total of 46 first-class matches with 13 wins, 10 defeats and 23 draws.\nPlayers.\nRangpur Division has had four Test players: Nasir Hossain, Naeem Islam senior, Sajidul Islam and Suhrawadi Shuvo. Team captains have been Tariq Ahmed (2011–12), Suhrawadi Shuvo (2012–13 and 2013–14), Sajidul Islam (2014–15) and Dhiman Ghosh (2015–16).\nThe two highest scores for Rangpur Division were made in the same innings: Dhiman Ghosh made 183 and Alauddin Babu 180, and they shared a fifth-wicket partnership of 322, which is also Rangpur Division's highest partnership for any wicket, in the match against Chittagong Division in 2011–12. The best bowling figures are 7 for 64 by Sanjit Saha, at the age of 17, against Khulna Division in 2015–16.\nThe list below is of all the players who have represented Rangpur Division from the 2011–12 season to the present.\nCurrent squad.\n, The current squad for 2019–20 season"

He played for the All Blacks in 37 matches (including eleven test matches) between 1953 and 1960. Jones was brought into Ted Griffin's Northland Auckland team in 1950 as an eighteen-year-old and became an immediate sensation. He was part of the North Auckland side under Johnny Smith's captaincy, which beat South Canterbury in Timaru to win the Ranfurly Shield in 1950. By the end of his provincial career, Jones had scored 30 tries in 79 appearances for North Auckland. Of close to Jonah Lomu dimensions, Jones was immensely difficult to stop close to the line, when he went 'super power' and became 'tiger' and simply went straight through the defence. He was worshipped in Northland for his unusual personality and refusal to accept advice to move to the big smoke, Auckland, to advance his career. His immense power was partly due to his demanding job as a fisherman, but he also exercised hard and at 28 and weighing more than 17.5 stone he was still fast.\nJones was listed at and when he made his debut in Bob Stuart's 1953–54 All Black side that toured Britain and France. By mid-tour he was weighed at . He played in the tests against England and Scotland and finished the tour with six tries from 12 appearances. He played all 4 tests against the Springboks in 1956 and the full series against the Wallabies in 1958. He was expected to peak on the South African Tour of 1960 when the All Black with a world class kicker in Don Clarke and awesome fast pack of Whineray(captain) Hemi, Young, Meads, Graham Tremain, Jones had the best chance they would ever have of taking a series in South Africa in the amateur age. Peter Jones form in the build up to the first test was awesome, against Northern Transval, he scored two tries in one of the greatest games every played. Even many Springboks praised him as the greatest forward on earth. After the second try he reacted to sledging of Pretoria crowd, by giving them the bird, a 30 second, two finger V sign that in the words of his biographer, Norman Harris, who shared NZ Herald sports coverage with Terry McLean 'it was obviously not a peace sign'. Like Barry John, taken out 15 minutes into the 1968 Lions v SA first test by Springbok lock, Frik De Preeze or the simultaneous hit on Chris Laidlaw in first test qt Pretoria in 1970, when a hard low tackle by Du Preeze was combined with a simultaneous hard blow, by flanker Abbie Bates (photo in P. Verdon. Tribute. Whitcoulls (2001)) Peter Jones was taken out of the sport in a game against a SA provincial side with a hit to the back by two players, a savage manoeuvre that have previously been attempted in a number of the previous games.\nWith an impressive physique that averaged about in the second half of his career, Jones was also blessed with the speed of a sprinter. Rugby journalist Terry McLean reported that Jones was capable of running in 10 seconds. Jones played 37 times for New Zealand and scored 20 tries. He was probably best remembered for his memorable try in the series-ending test against the Springboks in 1956."

VMI and High Point defeated Radford and Gardner-Webb, respectively, to advance to the quarterfinals, held at UNC Asheville's Kimmel Arena along with the semifinals.\nThe quarterfinals featured a pair of upsets, the first from the hands of VMI. The 7-seeded Keydets used a huge 2nd half run to pull away from #2 seed Coastal Carolina 85–68. Later that day, #6 Winthrop defeated #3 Campbell 71–55 thanks to 25 points from Reggie Middleton. Top-seed UNC Asheville blew away High Point 86–61, followed by Charleston Southern beating Liberty 89–72.\nVMI continued their upset run with a 20-point drubbing over Winthrop 75–55. Asheville defeated Charleston Southern 91–64, thus gaining home-court advantage for the championship game on March 3. In a game that flip-flopped leads in the first half, Asheville used a 9–0 run to break a 47–47 tie with VMI and take the lead for good.

The 10-team field was the largest in the event's history, and first round games were contested for just the second time – the last occurring in 1993.\nInitially, the Big South intended for only the top 10 teams to make the tournament, as Presbyterian was supposed to be complete its Division I transition this season. However, Presbyterian was given another transition year thus, remained ineligible for the NCAA tournament and thus not allowed to participate. As such, the ten other teams will contest the bracket.\nThis was the last tournament in which early-round games were held at campus sites. In June 2012, the conference announced that the 2013 men's and women's tournaments would be held solely at the Student Recreation and Convocation Center on Coastal Carolina's Conway, South Carolina campus, a venue which would ultimately open in fall 2012 as the HTC Center. With Presbyterian completing its Division I transition and Longwood joining the conference, the 2013 tournament will be the first to feature 12 teams.\nBracket.\nFirst round at campus sites of higher-numbered seeds&lt;br&gt;\nQuarterfinals and Semifinals games at #1 seed, Kimmel Arena in Asheville, NC&lt;br&gt;\nChampionship game hosted by highest remaining seed"

        "title": "Adventure Racing World Series",
        "text": "The Adventure Racing World Series (ARWS) is an endurance racing season where adventure racing teams compete in a range of disciplines including, for example, navigation, trekking, mountain biking, paddling and climbing.\nFormat.\nMixed gender teams of four competitors compete in a series of up to a dozen non-stop, multi-day expedition adventure races held in locations spread across the globe. These races culminate in the staging of the Adventure Racing World Championships, the winner of which is crowned World Champions.\nThe competition's format provides that each of the individual events of the World Series function as a qualifier for the World Championships. The top two finishing teams in each event secure the opportunity to compete in the World Championships. The field of event winners and second place getters is then supplemented by the reigning world champions, who are given the right to defend their title, and a selection of wild card entrants round out the number of starters.\nThe actual World Championship race rotates each year. One of the qualifying events is singled out and designated as the World Championship event and this event provides a dramatic conclusion to the end of the World Series racing season.\nIn addition to the World Championship race, points are assigned to results from each of the qualifying races in the series to determine a World Ranking. Points are allocated on a team's best two results in a calendar year over a two-year period (with heavier weighting given to World Championship results), with the ranking cycle periodically refreshed every 4–6 months.\nHistory.\nThe Adventure Racing World Championship was the brainchild of Geoff Hunt and Pascale Lorre, long-time adventure racers who sought to \"lend badly needed structure to the sport\". Hunt and Lorre's vision was first brought to fruition in Switzerland in 2001 where 41 teams contested the Discovery Channel World Championship Adventure Race with the controversy-plagued event eventually won by Finland's Team Nokia Adventure. A team from New Zealand, including Kathy Lynch, came second that year, US Team GoLite (became Nike ACG the following year) was 3rd.\nAfter a two-year hiatus the Adventure Racing World Championships was next held in Canada in 2004 and has subsequently been held every year since.\nIn 2011 management of the race was passed to the Australian event management company Geocentric Outdoors. The 2011 World Championships - won by Thule Adventure Team - were staged at the XPD Expedition Race in Tasmania, Australia, where 90 teams drawn from 21 countries made for the largest starting field in the event's history. This is testament to the fact that the World Series hosts some of the best expedition adventure racing teams in the world and \"continues to grow and become more prominent\". Geocentric Outdoors also instigated a number of new initiatives for the world series, including standardized equipment lists and logistics across the races, restrictions on mixed nationality teams at the World Championship race each year as well as the introduction of the World Series ranking system. These initiatives have encouraged larger international fields at the various races by lowering the logistical barriers for participation and rewarding participation in multiple events.\nIn 2012, the World Championships was held at Raid in France and were won by Team Seagate from New Zealand. The title of World Champion returned to the Thule Adventure Team at Costa Rica in 2013, before again being reclaimed by Team Seagate in Ecuador in 2014. Despite having never won a World Championship, Spanish team Columbia Vidaraid held the number-one position in the World Series ranking through 2014 and 2015 due to their string of wins in World Series qualifying races in addition to their second-place finishes in the 2013 and 2014 World Championships. Seagate regained the top position in the rankings in 2016 after dominating at the incredibly demanding 2015 World Championships, held in the Pantanal in Brazil, as well as in the Shoalhaven area of Australia in 2016.\nIn the absence of a world governing body, and after the cessation of the dominant world level events in the mid 2000s like the Raid Gauloises (Raid World Series and World Championships) Eco-Challenge, Primal Quest, and Outdoor Quest, the Adventure Racing World Series remained as the only series in the sport.\n2020 Adventure Racing World Series.\nCanceled races (due to COVID-19):||Expedition Africa, Adventure Race Malaysia, ITERA, Raid in France, Adventure Race Croatia, Expedition Oregon, PC 12 AR, XPD Adventure Race, Nordic Islands AR, Huairasinchi, Expedición Guaraní World Championships\n2021 Adventure Racing World Series.\nCanceled races (due to COVID-19):||Expedition Africa, Adventure Race Malaysia, ITERA, Raid in France, Adventure Race Croatia, Patagonia Raid\nExternal links.\nAlpine Quest"

        "title": "Brown University men's rowing",
        "text": "The Brown University men's rowing team represents Brown University in men's intercollegiate rowing and is the oldest organized intercollegiate sport at the university. Since its revival in 1949, the Brown University rowing program has become one of the most successful collegiate rowing programs in the world, winning men's and women's national titles, as well as championship titles at the world-famous Henley Royal Regatta in England. In addition, the program has produced 32 Olympic rowers.\nBrown rowing is characterized by its home course, the Seekonk River, and its historic rivalry with Yale and Harvard. The Brown rowing blade is half white (on bottom) and half brown (on the top).\nHistory.\nThe early years (1857–1886).\nBrown rowing was founded June 4, 1857, with the establishment of the University Boat Club, and consisted of a single six-oar shell, the \"Atalanta\". According to the \"Encyclopedia Brunoniana\", on September 11, 1857, the Brown Paper wrote:\n\"...She was there received by the club, borne to the water's edge and launched on the waves of Narragansett Bay with enthusiastic demonstrations from an assembled crowd.\" – The Brown Paper, September 11, 1857\nDescribed as \"a cumbersome lap-streak, weighing three or four hundred pounds,\" the shell only competed once, in a race on July 27, 1859, against Harvard and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester, Massachusetts. Because the boat weighed almost more than the Harvard and Yale boats, Brown lost the race, finishing over five minutes behind the victorious Harvard crew.\nIt was not until eleven years later, on June 17, 1860, that Brown won against Harvard and Yale, claiming its first and only race between 1857 and 1950. According to Harold Amber's book, \"Ever True: The History of Brown Crew\", Brown, in a spectacular series of events, recovered from a collision with an Amherst boat, executed a pristine turn, and overtook Yale and Harvard to win by six lengths.\nHowever, after that 1860 race, little changed over the next 26 years, and Brown suffered defeat after defeat, mishap after mishap; on November 8, 1874, the college boathouse caught fire and burned down, the club was almost constantly in debt, and interest in the program fluctuated so much that often there were not enough oarsmen to fill a boat. By 1886, the university had given up crew in favor of directing athletic funds towards baseball.\nThe revival (1947–1949).\nThe topic of Brown crew was brought up off and on for many years, but there was concern that a revival of crew would draw too heavily from the pool of track athletes and might also create a heavy financial burden on the university.\nIn 1947, two former prep-school oarsmen, James Donaldson and Harlan Bartlett, began to rebuild the program. With ten other students who had previous experience in rowing, the twelve oarsmen bought an old eight-oared shell from St. Andrew's School in Delaware for $100. With their new boat, rented boat space at the Narragansett Boat Club, and volunteer coach, Robert O. Reed, the crew began practicing on the Seekonk River.\n\"The Cinderella Crew\": Brown gains recognition.\nIn 1951, ’52, and ’53, a handful of victories brought the team some attention, but it was not until Gordon \"Whitey\" Helander took the reins in 1959 that the program gained recognition. At the time Helander was a student at the Rhode Island School of Design. Under his coaching, Brown won the Dad Vail Regatta in 1959, 1960, and 1961, with an undefeated 1960 regular season.\nIn 1960, the undefeated team entered the IRA, finishing fourth and the Olympic trials. This Brown crew, previously dubbed \"The Orphans of the Seekonk\", was re-christened \"The Cinderella Crew\" and Brown announced it was recognizing crew that fall.\nFollowing the 1961 season, in which the crew posted a 5–1 record, fifth at Eastern Sprints, and seventh in the IRA, rowing became an officially recognized and supported intercollegiate sport at Brown University. That August, Brown crew hired its first full-time coach, Victor H. Michalson, and in 1962 it became a regular member of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges.\n\"We Are the Champions\" (1993–1995).\nIn 1993, the Brown crew team had a perfect season. The eight-man crew consisted of Igor Boraska, Paul DiGiacomo, David Filippone, Gus Koven, Jamie Koven, Xeno Muller, Tony Padula, Chris Sahs, and coxswain Brian Madden. The team went undefeated, won the Eastern Sprints, the IRA (Intercollegiate Rowing Association) Championships, and the National Collegiate Rowing Championships. To finish it off, they captured the Ladies' Plate at the Henley Royal Regatta on July 4. Five of the eight members of the team went on to represent their respective countries in the Olympics.\nThe Cooke era (1996–present).\nIn 1996, Paul Cooke was named head coach of the freshman team, and in 2002 became the head coach of the varsity team. Under Cooke, the Bears have maintained their reputation as one of the most formidable rowing schools in the nation. The 2007–2008 team won an Ivy League championship title as well as a top-10 finish in the IRA Regatta. In 2008–2009, Brown documented a historic season, finishing second in the Champ 8 at the Head of the Charles, sweeping the heavyweight events at Eastern Sprints, placing third overall at Nationals, and capturing the Ladies' Plate Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in England.\nLocation and facilities.\nMarston Boathouse.\nThe home of the Brown University Rowing Team is the Hunter S. Marston Boathouse. The boathouse was purchased by Brown University in 1966 with funds donated by Hunter S. Marston, and dedicated October 7, 1967. Previously, the facility had been used as a fish processing plant by the Saltesea Packing Company.\nThe boathouse was modernized and renovated in 1994. The facility underwent a $1 million renovation by New England Construction in August 2008. In summer 2018, The dock was rebuilt, extending into the river further and with new sections for launches. Beginning in the spring of 2020, a renovation of the interior of Marston Boathouse is underway, with the intention of providing enhanced spaces for indoor rowing and weightlifting, as well as new locker rooms.\nSeekonk River.\nThe boathouse is located on the Seekonk River. Considered to be one of the tougher courses in the Ivy League, the Seekonk is known for its difficult rowing conditions, particularly heavy wind and waves, as well as a strong current. Many have attributed Brown's rowing success in part to the harsh conditions in which the team often practices."

        "text": "W. G. Grace established his reputation in 1864 and, by 1870, was widely recognised as the outstanding player in English cricket.\nBackground.\nGrace was still 15 when the 1864 season began and was 22 when the 1870 season ended. He lived with his parents at Downend, near Bristol, throughout the period. His father, Henry Mills Grace, was the local GP and, a lifelong cricket enthusiast, had founded Mangotsfield Cricket Club in 1845 to represent several neighbouring villages including Downend. In 1846, this club merged with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club whose name was adopted until 1867. West Gloucestershire Cricket Club was renamed Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 1867 and achieved first-class status in 1870. Grace himself recalled: \"Though the Gloucestershire County Club did not play regularly until 1870, my father frequently got up inter-county matches before that time. Those matches have never been generally chronicled, but they were played for five or six years, before first-class county cricket was established\".\nGrace had been \"notoriously unscholarly\" as a boy. Although opportunities arose, he never went to university as his father was intent upon him pursuing a medical career. But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace said he would have gone to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, aged 20, and was a medical student until he finally qualified in November 1879.\nCricket in the 1860s underwent an evolutionary phase with the legalisation of overarm bowling in June 1864 and Grace himself said it was \"no exaggeration to say that, between 1860 and 1870, English cricket passed through its most critical period\" with the game in transition and \"it was quite a revolutionary period so far as its rules were concerned\". Grace had much to say about the state of the grounds in the 1860s and declared that Lord's \"was in a very unsatisfactory condition\". He added that wickets at The Oval were always much better than at Lord's, where the clay in the soil handicapped the groundsmen. Writing in 1899, Grace recollected that he \"could go on to the pitch at Lord's and pick up a handful of small pieces of gravel\"; a source of danger as a fast ball hitting one of those small stones would \"fly high in the air\".\nIn August 1863, when he was just 15, Grace was one of four family members who played for Bristol and Didcot XVIII against the All-England Eleven. He bowled well and scored 32 off the bowling of John Jackson, George Tarrant and Cris Tinley. His brother E. M. Grace took ten wickets in the match, which Bristol and Didcot won by an innings, and as a result E.M. was invited to tour Australia a few months later with George Parr's England team.\n1864 English cricket season.\nE.M. did not return from Australia until July 1864 and his absence presented Grace with an opportunity to appear on cricket's greatest stages. He and his elder brother Henry were invited to play for the South Wales Club which had arranged a series of matches in London and Sussex, though Grace wondered humorously how they were qualified to represent South Wales. It was the first time that Grace left the West Country and he made his debut appearances at both The Oval and Lord's.\nThe South Wales Club's first match was at The Oval, which would become one of Grace's favourite venues, and he scored 5 and 38 against the Surrey Club in addition to taking 4 wickets. The South Wales captain wanted to drop Grace for the second match against the Gentlemen of Sussex at the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, but Henry Grace intervened and insisted that Grace must play as he was \"recruited for both games\". Henry Grace apparently informed the captain that no member of his family, including E.M. who was then the star turn, would represent South Wales in future. The captain backed down and Grace played at Hove but under great pressure to succeed. He certainly did succeed for he scored 170 and 56 not out. His innings of 170 was his first-ever century in a serious match. The third match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was Grace's debut at Lord's and he was joined by E.M. who had just disembarked from his voyage. Grace scored 50 in the first innings only three days after his sixteenth birthday.\nGrace regarded the South Wales matches as first-class fixtures and refers to them in his \"Cricketing Reminiscences\" as \"really big\" games. He was supported in his view by \"Lillywhite's Guide to Cricketers\" (1865 edition) which included his innings at Hove in a list called \"Scores of 100 or more made since 1850 in first-class matches\"; Grace's score was one of only six that exceeded 150. First-class status is a statistical concept and was never fully defined until an International Cricket Council (ICC) ruling in May 1947, but this does not apply retrospectively. Despite Grace's own views on the matter, his \"first-class career record\" was effectively created by F. S. Ashley-Cooper who produced a list of season-by-season figures to supplement Grace's obituary in the 1916 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". These figures came to be known as Grace's \"traditional\" career record and granted him 126 first-class centuries, a total beaten by Jack Hobbs in 1925; it was not until Roy Webber's researches in the 1950s that Ashley-Cooper's list was challenged.\nGrace had less success when he played for XXII of Bath against the All-England Eleven at Sydenham Field, Lansdown as Cris Tinley dismissed him twice for a duck, one of only four recorded \"pairs\" in his entire career (all of them were in minor matches). He also represented West Gloucestershire in 1864, and the Clifton Cricket Club of Bristol; for the first time, he scored more than 1,000 runs in all matches.\nThe final word on Grace's 1864 season was a line in John Lillywhite's \"Cricketer's Companion\" (\"aka\" \"Green Lilly\") which said: \"Mr W. G. Grace promises to be a good bat: bowls very fairly\".\n1865 English cricket season.\nHis name now well known in cricketing circles, Grace played for Gentlemen of the South v Players of the South at The Oval in June 1865 when he was still only 16 but already 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall and weighing 11 st (70 kg). This match is now regarded by \"CricketArchive\" as his first-class debut, although Grace himself considered the South Wales matches in 1864 to have been first-class. He bowled extremely well and had match figures of 13 for 84 using his \"genuine roundarm\" action. Although overarm was now legal, Grace never developed a true overarm action. At this stage of his career, he bowled fast-medium with \"a kind of slinging\" style. His bowling performance at The Oval earned him his first selection for the prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture.\nDuring this period, before the start of Test cricket in 1877, Gentlemen v Players was the most prestigious fixture in which a player could take part. This is apart from North v. South which was technically a fixture of higher quality given that the amateur Gentlemen were usually (until Grace took a hand) outclassed by the professional Players. Grace represented the Gentlemen in their matches against the Players from 1865 to 1906. It was he who enabled the amateurs to meet the paid professionals on level terms and to defeat them more often than not; his ability to master fast bowling was the key factor. Before Grace's debut in the fixture, the Gentlemen had lost 19 consecutive games; of the next 39 games they won 27 and lost only 4. In consecutive innings against the Players from 1871 to 1873, Grace scored 217, 77 and 112, 117, 163, 158 and 70. In his whole career, he scored a record 15 centuries in the fixture.\nGrace's 1865 debut in the fixture did not turn the tide as the Players won at The Oval by 118 runs. He played quite well and took seven wickets in the match but could only score 23 and 12 not out. In the second 1865 match, this time at Lord's, the Gentlemen finally ended their losing streak and won by 8 wickets, but it was E. M. Grace, not W.G., who was the key factor with 11 wickets in the match. Even so, Grace made his mark by scoring 34 out of 77–2 in the second innings to steer the Gentlemen to victory.\n\"CricketArchive\" recognises 5 first-class appearances in 1865 by Grace; he scored 189 runs at 27.00 with a highest score of 48 and held 5 catches. He took 20 wickets at 13.40 including the one performance of 10 wickets in a match (on his debut) with best figures of 8–40 in that match.\n1866 English cricket season.\nIn early June, while he was still only 17, Grace made his first visit to Sheffield, deputising for his brother E. M. Grace who was busy with his medical duties. The match was the last one recorded at the old Hyde Park Ground. As Grace later recalled, the ground \"stood on the top of a high hill, and I began to despair of the cab ever getting to the top\". He captained eighteen Colts of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield against the All-England Eleven, his team losing by an innings. Grace scored 9 in the first innings and 36 (out of 91) in the second. He said in his memoir that \"the All-England team were anxious to catch the train to get away to some other part of the country and they begged me to get out\", but he would not throw away his wicket. Simon Rae wrote that the game was \"an important test of character which he undoubtedly passed\".\nJust after his eighteenth birthday in July, Grace confirmed his potential once and for all when he scored 224 not out for All-England against Surrey at The Oval. This was his maiden first-class century and Bernard Darwin described it as \"characteristic of him that he made a thorough job of it\" because \"he was never tired of making runs and went on piling them up with a cheerful ruthlessness\". All-England won the match by an innings and 296 runs, in the process effectively killing off the idea of a county team taking on the rest of England. The idea was revived, however, in 1877 when the county in question was Grace's Gloucestershire.\nGrace was thenceforward the biggest name in cricket and the main spectator attraction. As Altham records, from then on \"the successes came thick and fast\". Grace himself recollected of the 1866 season that it was \"one of my greatest scoring seasons in the early days of my cricket\". He completed another large score when making 173 not out for Gentlemen of the South against Players of the South, also at The Oval, in August; and broke his bat in the process.\nGrace's best bowling performance of the season was in the second Gentlemen v Players match played at The Oval where he took 7–51 in the second innings and enabled his team to win by 98 runs, the Players having won the previous match by 38 runs.\nIt was in August 1866 that Grace made his debut for the United South of England Eleven (USEE), with whom he was to have a long and lucrative association. E. M. Grace made his debut in the same match, which was against Southgate Cricket Club at John Walker's Ground, although he made only a couple of appearances in total. Grace's younger brother Fred Grace, then only fifteen, was to become a USEE regular. The match at Southgate was lost by 3 wickets.\nDarwin summarised Grace's status at the end of the 1866 season thus: \"He was no longer climbing the ladder; he had got to the top, although he was still destined to add a few more rungs to it, dizzy rungs utterly beyond anyone else's reach\".\nAlthough photographs of Grace in later life reveal that he was by then corpulent, he was a fit man in his younger days, as his feats in 1866 confirm. He was a fine athlete and an example of his physical fitness was his 440 yards hurdles victory in the National and Olympian Association meeting at Crystal Palace the day after the long innings at The Oval for All-England against Surrey. At his peak, he was 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall and usually weighed about 12 st (76 kg). A non-smoker, he kept himself in condition all year round by shooting, hunting or running with the beagles as soon as the cricket season was over.\nAccording to \"CricketArchive\", Grace made 8 first-class appearances in 1866, scoring 581 runs at 52.81 including 2 centuries with a highest score of 224 not out and taking 9 catches. He took 31 wickets at 15.58 including 3 returns of 5 wickets in an innings with best figures of 7–51 in the Gentlemen v Players match. These figures brought him for the first time into leading positions in the seasonal first-class statistics. He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Harry Jupp, Tom Hearne, Charles Buller and Russell Walker; and second in the batting averages behind Robert Carpenter. He was a creditable 15th in the list of wicket-takers, having bowled many less deliveries than all of those above him except James Southerton. Grace took 31 wickets from 1,269 deliveries compared with the overall leader George Wootton who took 119 wickets from 4,712 deliveries, though Wootton had a more economical average.\n1867 English cricket season.\nGrace was out of the game for much of the 1867 season due to illness and injury. He sustained a sprained ankle in early May which sidelined him until June and then was ill with scarlet fever for a whole month from 10 July to 10 August. On 26 August, when fielding in the All-England v Surrey and Sussex match, his right forefinger was split open, a wound that later reopened. As a result, he made few appearances, \"CricketArchive\" ranking 4 of them first-class. In these, he scored a modest 154 runs at 30.80 with a highest score of 75, against Middlesex at Lord's, and holding 4 catches. Even so, his bowling was outstanding as he took 39 wickets at only 7.51 with a best analysis of 8–25. He had 5 returns of 5 wickets in an innings and 2 of 10 wickets in a match. His 8–25 (11–64 in the match) was achieved in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in July when his team won by 8 wickets.\nApart from a few players who bowled only a small number of overs, Grace topped the season's national bowling averages, his 7.51 being marginally better than the 7.66 of Yorkshire's new left-arm fast bowler Tom Emmett who, with 48 wickets, was making his mark in 1867. Emmett, one of the game's great characters, would become one of Grace's most respected opponents but also a good friend. But the two leading bowlers that season were Wootton and Southerton who took 142 and 132 wickets respectively, both at low averages.\n1868 English cricket season.\nThe renamed Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, still neither a formally constituted entity nor a first-class team, was in London on 25 and 26 June to play a two-day match against MCC at Lord's. The MCC team was weak, apart from George Wootton, and Gloucestershire won by 134 runs thanks to a fine performance by E.M. and a solid one by Grace.\nA few days later, Grace returned to Lord's and produced \"one of his most commanding performances\". Playing for the Gentlemen against the Players, he scored 134, all run, out of only 201 and said later that it was \"my finest innings\" as the pitch was playing \"queerly\". In fact, the pitch was bare in places and behaved erratically with good-length balls sometimes flying over the wicketkeeper's head. Grace then took 6–50 and 4–31 (10–81 in the match) to complete a \"match double\". The Players had to follow on and the Gentlemen won by 8 wickets. In Simon Rae's view, \"W.G. had won the most important match of the season virtually on his own\".\nSoon afterwards, playing at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury from 2 to 4 August, Grace scored two centuries in a match for South of the Thames v North of the Thames, only the second time in cricket history that this is known to have been done, following William Lambert in 1817. Grace scored 130 and 102 not out against an attack that included George Wootton, Tom Hearne and Jem Grundy. Even so, the North won by 58 runs.\nGrace made a handful of appearances for the USEE including a 10 wicket victory over Southgate followed a week later by a 57 run defeat in Worcester by a Worcestershire County XXII. In the latter match, Grace was bowled cheaply in each innings by the Nottinghamshire professional fast bowler William McIntyre, who was playing as a given man for Worcestershire. As he did not yet have a first-class county to play for and did not join MCC until the following year, Grace's opportunities to play in major matches were few but, throughout his career, he was always keen to \"fill in the gaps\" by playing in minor matches. He was invariably a formidable opponent in these and in one game for Clifton against a Civil Service team, he hammered the bowling for 210.\nAccording to \"CricketArchive\", Grace made 7 first-class appearances in 1868, scoring 588 runs at 65.33 including 3 centuries with a highest score of 134 not out and holding 5 catches. He took 44 wickets at 14.52 including 5 returns of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 7–23, and 3 times he took 10 wickets in a match. For the first time, he finished top of the national batting averages (i.e., among those who played more than a couple of matches). He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Jupp, Humphrey, Isaac Walker and James Lillywhite but they all played many more innings than he did. He was 11th in the list of wicket-takers but again he bowled relatively few overs compared with most of those above him. The leaders were Southerton (151 wickets), Willsher (113) and Wootton (106) while Tom Hearne (33 at 8.45) and Emmett (60 at 8.80) topped the averages.\nBernard Darwin wrote that 1868 was \"possibly the first time in which the complaint was made that the bat held an unfair advantage over the ball\". Grace was certainly the outstanding batsman that season and was consistently out-performing all other players, including E.M., and Simon Rae summarised the season by saying that Grace was \"now indisputably the cricketer of the age, the Champion\".\nHaving turned down the chance of going to Oxford University in 1866, Grace did the same when approached by Cambridge University in 1868. His explanation was that his father wanted him to pursue a medical career and Grace enrolled at Bristol Medical School on 7 October. Darwin's book contains a photograph of the enrolment register page which shows that Grace joined the General Perpetual Students for the winter session of 1868–69 and paid £23 12s 6d along with five other students.\n1869 English cricket season.\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was particularly keen to recruit Grace and, in 1869, he became a member after being proposed by the treasurer, Thomas Burgoyne, and seconded by the secretary, Robert Allan Fitzgerald. One of the ongoing issues of 1860s cricket was a dispute between the northern professionals, led by George Parr, and Surrey, such that they refused to play at The Oval. There were even fears that the professionals would break away and form their own cricket organisation, rather as happened in rugby football in the 1890s. Grace was already the greatest attraction cricket had ever known and large crowds attended every match he played in. MCC feared the loss of its authority should Grace \"throw in his lot with the professionals\" so it was considered vital for them and their interests to get him onside. As it happens, the dispute was nearly over but it has been said that \"MCC regained its authority over the game by hanging onto W.G.'s shirt-tails\".\nGrace wore MCC colours for the rest of his career, playing for them on an irregular basis until 1904, and their red and yellow hooped cap became as synonymous with him as his large black beard. He played for MCC on an expenses only basis but any hopes that the premier club had of keeping him firmly within the amateur ranks would soon be disappointed for his services were much in demand.\nGrace made his MCC debut on 13 and 14 May at the Magdalen Ground in Oxford against the university team and scored 117 in his only innings as MCC won by an innings and 30 runs. Grace and George Wootton shared 19 wickets. Grace's first appearance for MCC at Lord's a few days later was against the official South, which consisted mainly of his USEE colleagues. The South won by an innings and 17 runs.\nGrace scored four centuries in July, including an innings of 180 for the Gentlemen of the South v the Players of the South at The Oval. This was achieved during the highest wicket partnership involving Grace in his entire career; he shared 283 runs for the first wicket with Bransby Cooper who scored 101. Towards the end of the month, Grace represented the South in the North v. South match at Bramall Lane, his team winning by 66 runs. He scored 122 out of 173 in the first innings and then took 6–57. His batting against the formidable bowling of George Freeman, Tom Emmett and George Wootton was so good that the laconic Emmett afterwards declared Grace to be a \"nonsuch\" (i.e., a nonpareil) and then famously said: \"He ought to be made to play with a littler bat\".\nAccording to \"CricketArchive\", Grace made 15 first-class appearances in 1869, the most by him in a season to date. In these, he scored 1,000 runs in a season for the first time with 1,320 at 57.39 including 6 centuries with a highest score of 180 and holding 12 catches. He took 73 wickets at 16.28 including 7 returns of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 6–10, and 1 instance of 10 wickets in a match. He finished as both highest runscorer and top of the national batting averages, Harry Jupp being the only other batsman to exceed 1,000 runs. Grace was 3rd in the list of wicket-takers behind Southerton (136 wickets) and Wootton (120) but he was well down the averages which were led by Tom Hearne (9.34) and Yorkshire fast bowler George Freeman (9.73).\n1870 English cricket season.\nIt is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 &amp; 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers E.M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6–86 and 6–20. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire.\nGrace, a medical student at the time, was first on the scene when George Summers received the blow on the head that caused his death four days later. This was in the MCC v Nottinghamshire match at Lord's in June. Grace was fielding nearby when Summers was struck and took his pulse. Summers recovered consciousness and Grace advised him to leave the field. Summers did not go to hospital but it transpired later that his skull had been fractured. The Lord's pitch had a poor reputation for being rough, uneven and unpredictable all through the 19th century and many players including Grace considered it dangerous.\nThe United South of England Eleven (USEE) had been formed by Edgar Willsher in 1865 but the heyday of the travelling teams was over and their organisers were desperate to feature new attractions. Grace had played for them previously but he formally joined the United South in 1870 as its match organiser, for which he received payment, but he played for expenses only. His first match for the USEE in 1870 was in July against the United North of England Eleven at Lord's, but his team was well beaten by an innings. The United South survived until 1882 and was the last of the great travelling elevens to fold, its longevity due to Grace's involvement.\nHe scored 215 for the Gentlemen which was the first time anyone scored a double century in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. The Players managed to save this game, which was drawn, but the Gentlemen won the next one at Lord's by 4 runs. Grace scored 109 out of 187 in the first innings of a low-scoring match.\nAccording to \"CricketArchive\", Grace made 21 first-class appearances in 1870, easily his highest tally so far, scoring 1,808 runs at 54.78 including 5 centuries with a highest score of 215 and holding 19 catches. He took 50 wickets at 15.70 including 4 instances of 5 wickets in an innings, with a best analysis of 6–24, but he did not manage 10 wickets in a match. For the second successive season, he finished as both highest runscorer and top of the national batting averages, Ted Pooley and Harry Jupp being the only other batsmen to exceed 1,000 runs. Grace's 50 wickets placed him 9th in that list, well behind the leader Southerton who took an unprecedented 210, the first time a bowler had exceeded 200 in a season. No one else reached 100 and the other leading bowlers were Jem Shaw, Alfred Shaw, Wootton, Willsher, Freeman, James Street and Emmett. The best average was Freeman's 7.11. Grace summarised the 1870 season as \"one of my best\" but he declared 1871 to have been \"my most successful\".\nBirley records that it was at this time, \"scorning the puny modern fashion of moustaches\", that Grace grew the enormous black beard that made him so recognisable. In addition, his \"ample girth\" had developed for he weighed 15 stone (95 kg) in his early twenties. Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine; many years later, when discussing the overheads incurred during Lord Sheffield's profitless tour of Australia in 1891–92, Arthur Shrewsbury commented: \"I told you what wine would be drunk by the amateurs; Grace himself would drink enough to swim a ship.\"\nFootnote.\n• a) As described in Grace's first-class career statistics, there are different versions of Grace's first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians re the status of some matches he played in. Note that this is a statistical issue only and has little, if any, bearing on the historical aspects of Grace's career. In the infobox, the \"traditional\" first-class figures from \"Wisden 1916\" (as reproduced by Rae, pp. 495–496), are given first and the \"amended\" figures from \"CricketArchive\" follow in parentheses. There is no dispute about Grace's Test career record and those statistics are universally recognised. See Variations in first-class cricket statistics for more information."

        "text": "Tom Parker (born July 1, 1950) is an American former standout basketball player at the University of Kentucky who played for the Wildcats between 1969 and 1972. As a senior in 1971–72 he was named the co-Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. As of 2011 he is a teacher at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky.\nEarly life and high school.\nParker grew up in Collinsville, Illinois and attended Collinsville High School. Standing at and weighing , he played the center position and dominated his opponents. In three seasons of varsity basketball he scored 2,041 career points and set many school records. These records include his career point total, points in a single game (50), season and career scoring averages (32.9 and 23.7, respectively), field goals made in a game (21), season (359) and career (818), shots taken in a career (1,520), total career rebounds (851) as well as defensive rebounds in a career (559). In all three seasons he suited up for the Kahoks he garnered all-state honors, and as a senior he was named a \"Parade\" magazine All-American.\nKentucky and later life.\nWhen Parker matriculated in 1968–69, NCAA eligibility rules at the time prohibited freshmen from playing on varsity teams, thus his official career at Kentucky did not start until his sophomore campaign in 1969–70. Parker was a solid contributor from the start, averaging 10.4 points per game in 25 appearances. He played a key role as a reserve in a season where the Wildcats won their third of what would be six consecutive Southeastern Conference regular season championships. They advanced to the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament's Elite Eight before losing to Jacksonville, 106–100. The following season Parker became a prominent player and a regular starter. In 28 games he averaged 17.5 points, which led Kentucky, and the team reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. He was an All-SEC First Team performer as well as a member on the Academic All-SEC Team. Parker's final season in 1971–72 saw him lead Kentucky back to the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight behind an 18.0 points per game average. He was named the co-SEC Player of the Year with Mike Edwards of Tennessee and he repeated as a first team all-conference performer.\nIn 80 career games Parker scored 1,238 points and grabbed 660 rebounds. Parker also unwittingly played a large part in influencing soon-to-be Kentucky star Jack Givens' decision to attend. Givens was not thrilled with Kentucky as a potential school to play for, but after seeing Parker in action his attitude changed. Givens later said, \"Tom Parker could really shoot the ball, a lefty small forward who was a lot like Kevin Grevey ... I loved the way Tom played, so that made me change my thinking towards Kentucky.\"\nAfter his collegiate career, the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association selected him in the sixth round (83rd overall) in the 1972 NBA draft, although Parker never played in the league. He eventually became a teacher and now resides in Lexington, Kentucky."

This worked particularly well between 2018 and 2019 when Australians Jack O'Brien and Darcy Etrich and Scotland's Sam Herron had stints with the club. The perspective of the club's management was that overseas players would assist the development of the local players and expand their rugby league knowledge.\nDue to Red Star Rugby League being unbeaten through 2018 and 2019, the club management allowed the imported players to leave the club and focused on the development of the local playing group and juniors in 2020. This was also exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the club being forced to send Phil Economidis home, and then allowing Vladica Nikolic to return to France in late August 2020.\nRed Star's future goals are to support the development of European Rugby League club competitions that are aligned with the goals of the RLEF and the Serbian Rugby League Federation.\nSquad.\nCurrent Squad:"

It took place from January 7th to January 15th. \nThe tournament was won by Christian Kist, an unseeded qualifier who was making his début at the event; Kist beat Tony O'Shea 7–5 in the final. Two-time defending champion Martin Adams lost in the quarter-finals against O'Shea. \nThe defending women's champion Gulliver, a nine-time winner of the event, lost in the semi-finals to Anastasia Dobromyslova. Dobromyslova then beat Deta Hedman in the final to win her second world title. \nIt was the first time that neither champion was from Great Britain (Christian Kist from the Netherlands and Anastasia Dobromyslova from Russia), despite both losing finalists coming from England (Tony O'Shea and Deta Hedman).\nBoth men's semi-finals were the subject of controversy. In the first, between Ted Hankey and Christian Kist, Hankey complained repeatedly about the air conditioning at the venue, claiming it was blowing his darts off course. Hankey later alleged that this was done deliberately, as he would be joining the PDC after the tournament. This was days after a similar incident at the rival PDC World Championship, which led to Adrian Lewis and James Wade walking off the stage due to a draft. Referring to that incident, Martin Adams, a BDO board member, had said before the Lakeside event started: “I can promise there will be no gusts of wind blowing across the stage.” Then, in the second semi-final, between Tony O'Shea and Wesley Harms, the players left the stage so the board could be replaced following 23 bounce outs.\nPlayers from five countries including a record number of eight Dutch players took part in the tournament.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nMen's.\nThe televised stages featured 32 players.

        "title": "Jordan Williams (rugby union)",
        "text": "Jordan Rhys Williams (born 20 September 1993) is a Welsh rugby union footballer who plays for the Dragons. His regular position is at full-back, but he has also played at fly-half and on the wing. He began his career with amateur side New Dock Stars RFC, before being signed by Llanelli RFC and ultimately breaking into the Scarlets regional side. However, he struggled to find playing time with the Scarlets and moved to Bristol in 2016, only to return to Wales with the Dragons two years later. He has also played internationally for Wales at under-16, under-18 and under-20 level, as well as for the Wales Sevens team.\nCareer.\nLlanelli RFC.\nBorn at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, Williams is the son of former Llanelli RFC lock Lee Williams. He grew up in Llanelli and attended the local Coedcae School with Scarlets team-mate Samson Lee, and began his rugby career with New Dock Stars RFC, a former club of veteran Scarlets prop Phil John. Williams joined the Scarlets academy at the age of 15 and made his first appearance for Llanelli RFC as a replacement in a 32–16 win over Cardiff RFC on 4 December 2010. At the end of January 2011, he made his first appearance for the Scarlets, coming on as a replacement for Steven Shingler for the final seven minutes of a 34–7 Anglo-Welsh Cup defeat to Saracens. He started his first game two weeks later, playing at fly-half for Llanelli and scoring five points (one conversion and one penalty) in a 59–15 defeat to Aberavon.\nOver the course of the following 2011–12 season, Williams gradually made the transition to full-back as he played 24 times for Llanelli. As the team's regular kicker, he amassed 337 points, including 12 tries. For his performances in November 2011, he was named as the Principality Premiership Player of the Month, but his stand-out performance came in April 2012 in a 55–8 win over Newport RFC, in which he scored four tries on the way to a total of 35 points. Williams contributed 25 points as Llanelli beat Aberavon 40–26 in the play-off semi-final at the end of the season, and also scored eight points in the final against Pontypridd, although Ponty won the match 15–13. For his performances throughout the season, Williams was named the Premiership's Best Newcomer in the end of season awards. Those performances also saw Williams make his second appearance for the Scarlets in October 2011, against Leicester Tigers in the Anglo-Welsh Cup; after coming on for starting fly-half Aled Thomas in the 53rd minute, Williams scored a last-minute solo try, which he also converted to seal a 31–3 victory.\nScarlets.\nAfter being awarded with a development contract for the 2012–13 season, Williams made his first league start for the Scarlets as a full-back away to Connacht on 15 September 2012, scoring two tries and a conversion on the way to a 24–11 victory and the man of the match award. After missing the team's next game against the Ospreys, he returned to the side for a 22–20 defeat away to Benetton Treviso; Williams was at fault for Treviso's third try of the game, as his kick was charged down and run in by Robert Barbieri. That was his last appearance for the Scarlets for almost a year. Things got worse for Williams in October 2012, when he suffered a dislocated shoulder while playing for Llanelli in a 38–28 victory over Gala RFC in the British and Irish Cup, which kept him out for four months. After his recovery, he returned to the fly-half position for all eight of Llanelli's remaining Premiership games for which he was available, including the 47–15 loss to Pontypridd in the play-off final.\nWith the departures of wingers George North and Andy Fenby from the Scarlets after the 2012–13 season, Williams found himself back in the Scarlets team for 2013–14, albeit out of position. After being named on the bench for the first game of the season against Leinster, Williams started seven of the next eight games on the left wing, followed by one on the right, scoring tries in the league against Edinburgh and in the Heineken Cup against Harlequins, sandwiching a penalty against Glasgow Warriors. As he had been included in the Wales squad for the 2013 Autumn internationals, he missed the next two games for the Scarlets, but returned to the side as a replacement for the return fixture against Leinster on 30 November, before starting both matches against Clermont in the Heineken Cup; he kicked a penalty in the away fixture, but also missed a conversion. After missing the last two matches of the year against Munster and the Ospreys, Williams was a replacement for the Scarlets' first two games of 2014 (going unused in the Heineken Cup against Racing Métro), before starting each of the remaining games of the season, either on the left wing or at full-back. In February 2014, he scored three tries in two games, starting with the final score in a 41–33 win over Benetton, before scoring twice in a 25–21 win at home to Edinburgh. He scored twice more in the final four games of the season, first in the 27–20 home win over Zebre on 12 April, and then in the 34–23 bonus-point win at home to the Dragons that secured the Scarlets' place in the 2014–15 European Rugby Champions Cup.\nDespite being picked by the BBC's Sean Holley and Jonathan Davies as a player to watch in 2014–15, Williams began the season down the pecking order among the Scarlets' back three options, starting just one of the team's opening nine matches of the season, albeit being named on the bench for their first two Champions Cup games. He suffered a concussion that kept him out of the game against Zebre on 1 November, but returned to the starting line-up for the Scarlets' two Anglo-Welsh Cup matches that month, before dropping to the bench for the Pro12 game against Glasgow on 21 November, and only after Regan King had been injured in the pre-match warm-up. He was on the bench again for the first two games of 2015, and was forced into an extended cameo in the second match against Glasgow after Liam Williams suffered a shoulder injury early in the second half, and started in place of Williams in the next match away to Leicester Tigers in the Champions Cup the following week. Full-back duties were assigned to Steven Shingler, Josh Lewis and Kristian Phillips for the next three games, but Williams started the next five during the 2015 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the first of those in a 32–14 home win over Connacht on 15 February after making an interception on his own goal line, and another in a 23–13 win at home to Leinster on 7 March. A shoulder injury that required surgery brought an early end to Williams' season. During the season, Williams also played three times for Carmarthen Quins in the British and Irish Cup, scoring one try against Jersey Reds.\nIn 2015–16, Williams played just twice for the Scarlets: in a 20–8 away win over Zebre on 4 October, and in a 31–15 away loss to Munster on the final day of the season. He was far more active for Llanelli, playing nine times in the Welsh Premiership at wing, full-back and fly-half, and scoring seven tries and six conversions. On 5 April 2016, it was announced that Williams had agreed a two-year contract with newly promoted Premiership Rugby side Bristol Rugby ahead of the 2016–17 season.\nBristol.\nWilliams made his debut for Bristol in a 70–22 loss to Wasps in the third week of the 2016–17 Premiership Rugby season. He scored his first try for the club the following week, in a 41–17 home defeat to Exeter Chiefs; he also provided the conversion for Max Crumpton's late try. He played six more times for Bristol in the league that season (five starts), as well as twice in the 2016–17 European Rugby Challenge Cup, although his only further points came in the form of two tries against Cardiff Blues in the Challenge Cup. Bristol finished bottom of the Premiership and were relegated to the Championship again; however, Williams' team-leading 14 tries in 19 appearances helped Bristol to win 21 of their 22 matches in 2017–18, as they won the Championship title by 20 clear points over Ealing Trailfinders.\nDragons.\nDespite finding success in the RFU Championship, in November 2017, Williams agreed to return to Wales with the Dragons for the 2018–19 season after the expiry of his contract with Bristol in order to make himself eligible to play for Wales again. He was ever-present for the Dragons during the 2018–19 season, playing 26 times and scoring four tries, a conversion and two penalties. He made his debut on 1 September 2018, in a 21–17 home defeat to Benetton Treviso, and scored his first try two weeks later, a 60-metre solo score in a 52–10 away defeat to Leinster. His kicking abilities were in evidence the following week, when he landed a long-range effort in a 16–5 home win over Zebre, followed by another penalty and a conversion, as well as setting up the opening try for Josh Lewis, in a 23–15 home loss to the Cardiff Blues. Despite continuing to provide opportunities for his teammates, his next score did not come for another 12 matches, as he scored the seventh of the Dragons' nine tries in a 59–3 win at home to Timișoara Saracens in the European Challenge Cup on 11 January 2019. He scored again after coming off the bench in the team's very next match, at home to Clermont, but it proved to be only a consolation try, as the French side won 49–7 to eliminate the Dragons from the Challenge Cup. His final score of the season came on 4 April, when he came off the bench to help the Dragons come from behind to salvage an 18–18 draw away to the Southern Kings.\nIn 2019–20, Williams scored twice in his first six appearances of the season, first against Zebre in the Dragons' first away win for more than four years, then against Leinster, before missing a game for the first time since joining the Dragons, in their opening Challenge Cup game of the season against Castres. He returned to the side for the Challenge Cup game against Enisei-STM, and scored the opening try inside 10 minutes after running from deep within his own half; however, he suffered an injury before the end of the first half and had to be substituted. It later turned out that he had injured his anterior cruciate ligament and had to undergo surgery that ruled him out for the next few months. Despite the injury, in February 2020, he signed a new \"long-term\" contract with the Dragons. Following the suspension and subsequent resumption of professional rugby union due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams eventually made his comeback in the Dragons' European Challenge Cup quarter-final match against Bristol on 18 September 2020, almost 10 months after his injury, though he was unable to prevent his former side from winning comfortably, 56–17.\nWilliams missed the first game of the 2020–21 season against Leinster, but returned for the Dragons' 26–18 win at home to Zebre on 9 October, in which he scored two tries and set up Jamie Roberts for another. He was not selected for the Dragons' next 10 matches, but returned again in February 2021 to start seven of the next nine, beginning with a home defeat to Connacht. He scored two more tries in that time, against Glasgow on 21 March, and against the Scarlets on 25 April.\nInternational.\nAfter playing for Wales at both under-16 and under-18 level, Williams received his first call-up to the Wales under-20 team for the 2012 Six Nations Under 20s Championship. After being named as an unused replacement for the 28–15 home win over Scotland, he came off the bench in the 68th minute of the 40–9 away loss to England two weeks later. He then started the following match against Italy and kicked two conversions as Wales won 30–23, before again being an unused replacement for the final match against France, which France won 36–16. The following season, Williams was still suffering from a shoulder injury at the start of the 2013 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, but joined up with the squad once he had recovered. He missed Wales' 17–15 win over Ireland in the opening match, but was fit enough to make an appearance off the bench in the second game, a 27–13 away win over France, before returning to the starting line-up at full-back for the final three matches. Victories over Italy and Scotland meant the final match at home to England served as a title decider, with Wales playing for a Grand Slam; however, England won 28–15 to take the title on points difference.\nAt the end of the 2012–13 season, Williams was named in the Wales squad for the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship. He was left out of the opening match, a 42–3 win over Samoa, before starting at full-back in the 26–21 win over Scotland four days later. He was named on the bench for the final pool match against Argentina, and came on for Hallam Amos in the 59th minute as Wales won 25–20 to top the group and qualify for the semi-finals. Williams again started at full-back in the semi-final against defending champions South Africa, and played a part in both of Wales' tries; for the first, a deft pass allowed captain Ellis Jenkins to crash over and give Wales an 11–7 lead. South Africa replied almost immediately, and had a six-point lead going into the final minute, when Williams broke four tackles to put Wales in good field position for Sam Davies to set up a try for wing Ashley Evans, which Davies then converted to give Wales an 18–17 win. Williams was again picked at full-back for the final against England on 23 June, but England won the match and the title. \nWilliams received his first call-up to the Wales senior team for the match against Tonga during the 2013 Autumn internationals. He was named on the bench for the game, but did not make an appearance. In 2014, following an extended run in the Scarlets team at both wing and full-back to end the season, Williams was named in the Possibles squad for a Probables vs Possibles match ahead of Wales' summer tour to South Africa, although the unavailability of some players meant he was picked on the wing for the Probables team for the match itself. Williams scored two tries as the Probables won 55–7, and was selected as one of three wings for the tour. Former Wales captain Martyn Williams said Williams provided \"[an option] off the bench we haven't had in the past\". Williams started the warm-up match against Eastern Province Kings, playing the full 80 minutes of the 34–12 win, but was not selected in the matchday squad for either test match. In 2015, Williams was selected in the Wales Sevens squad for the first two legs of the 2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai and Cape Town."

        "text": "The 2011–2012 St. Francis Terriers men's basketball team represented St. Francis College during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team is coached by Glenn Braica, who is in his second year at the helm of the St. Francis Terriers. The Terrier's home games are played at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex. The team has been a member of the Northeast Conference since 1981. They finished the season at 15–15 overall and 12–6 in NEC play to finish in fourth place. The Terriers went on to lose in the quarterfinals of the Northeast Conference Basketball tournament to Quinnipiac.\nBraica was awarded the NEC Jim Phelan coach of the year award and freshman forward Jalen Cannon was selected to the NEC All-Rookie team. Ben Mockford led the Terriers in scoring with 11.8 points per game, Jalen Cannon led the team in rebounding with 8.8 per game and Brent Jones paced the team with 3.9 assists per game.\nSeason outlook.\nGoing into Glenn Braica's second year as head coach, the Terriers were looking to build on the previous years success and get beyond the NEC quarter-finals. Although, the Terriers lost several key pieces to their team via graduation, including St. Francis College all-time leading scorer, Ricky Cadell, and Akeem Bennett. These losses led in part to their NEC coaches preseason poll selection to finish 11th.\nRecruiting.\n6' 6\" power forward Lowell Ulmer, 6' 5” guard Kevin Douglas and 6' 6” power forward Jalen Cannon were signed in the spring.\nRegular season.\nThe Terriers had a difficult schedule with their first 9 games on the road. To begin the year, the Terriers lost 3 close games to Seton Hall, Lafayette and Hofstra. In the season opener the Terriers were leading 62–60 with 0:09 left, yet they gave up the lead and lost in overtime 71–75. Against Lafayette, the Terriers were tied 69–69 with just 1:33 left, but were unable to pull out the victory. Versus Hofstra, the game was tied 9 times and there were 12 lead changes as the game went down to the wire. In the fourth contest of the season the Terriers were soundly defeated by the Red Storm. Against NJIT, the Terriers picked up their first win of the season behind a 22-point performance by Ben Mockford. Then in their first conference game, the Terriers rode Mockford's 19 points to beat the Mountaineers and win their second game of the season. After their 2-game winning streak, the Terriers lost to the surging Wagner Seahawks, which went on to defeat 13th ranked Pittsburgh. The Terriers next faced Colgate, a team that has never beaten them before (4–0), and loss a close contest 63–65. Then, after being on the losing end of buzzer-beaters and last minute runs, the Terriers pulled out a win in the final minute of the game at Howard.\nThe Terriers then began a 3-game homestand at the Pope, where they lost their first 2 to Albany and Norfolk State. In their final game of the homestand the Terriers won their first home game against Brown. The Terriers then went on the road against Army where they faltered ending the non-conference portion of the schedule and finishing 3–7 against non-conference opponents. The Terriers then got hot and won 9 out of their next 10 games against conference opponents. Their only loss was to Wagner, which swept the season series, 0–2. Heading into Rivalry Week the Terriers were set to play 2 matches against LIU and at stake was 1st place in the NEC. Yet the Terriers were swept, losing both games, including the Battle of Brooklyn ending their hopes of a regular season championship. The Terriers then bounced back and beat Quinnipiac on the road, taking the season series 2–0 and clinching a NEC Tournament spot with 3 games left to play. They then went on to go 1–2 beating Sacred Heart and losing to Monmouth and Farleigh Dickinson; both loses came on the road. One high note came in the last game of the regular season, when freshman Jalen Cannon grabbed 20 rebounds against Farleigh Dickinson, which was the most by a Division I freshman in the entire country last season.\nThe Terriers were able to get the 4th seed going into the NEC tournament. They will host their first home playoff game since 1997. Additionally, coach Glenn Braica won the NEC Jim Phelan coach of the year award and Jalen Cannon was selected to the NEC All-Rookie team.\nNEC tournament.\nThe Terriers clinched the 4th seed in the Northeast Conference tournament and faced 5th seed Quinnipiac at home.

        "title": "Brian Cummings (American football)",
        "text": "Brian Cummings (born September 1975) is an American former football player. He played college football as a quarterback for the University of Maryland from 1994 to 1997.\nEarly life.\nA native of Westchester County, Cummings attended the Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York. He played as a quarterback on the football team which ran a run and shoot offense. In October 1992, he led the Catholic High School Football League with eight touchdown passes. Maryland quarterback coach Rob Spence, who coached at Iona Prep in the 1980s, said many people told Cummings he was not fit for a Division I quarterback due to his size and height (5 ft, 11 in, 195 pounds). Maryland was the only major college football program to offer Cummings a scholarship. He was selected in the 50th round of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft by the Montreal Expos. His brother, Craig Cummings, played college football at Delaware.\nKnown better to his friends as \"The Commish\".\nCollege career.\nCummings attended the University of Maryland, and played on the football team, which also employed the run-and-shoot under head coach Mark Duffner. As a freshman in 1994, he was third on the depth chart at quarterback and considered transferring to a small college or focusing on his baseball career. He saw action in six games, but did not attempt a pass. Cummings was responsible for running Maryland's short-yardage offense and he rushed 15 times for 63 yards and four touchdowns. In the spring, Cummings played as a pitcher on the baseball team, which he led in pitching wins. During the summer, he pitched for an All-American Amateur Baseball Association under-20 team, the Maryland Bombers. Cummings became the backup after Kevin Foley lost out on the starting position and transferred to Boston University.\nIn 1995, he played in seven games and completed 98 of 166 pass attempts for 1,193 yards, five touchdowns, and four interceptions. Before the season, Cummings was named the starter after senior Scott Milanovich received a four-game suspension for gambling. He led the Terrapins to a surprising 4–0 start after the team had been picked to finish seventh in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Cummings was knocked out of the season opener against Tulane with a sprained ankle in the first quarter, and was replaced by Orlando Strozier. Cummings returned to start in a 32–18 upset over North Carolina, and completed ten passes on 18 attempts for 180 yards despite his ankle injury.\nAgainst Duke, he threw for a career-high 299 yards. Wide receiver Jermaine Lewis said, \"Brian won the first four games and the team tends to really rally around him... I guess we tend to have a lot of confidence with him in there.\" Cummings suffered a broken toe on his right foot and bruised shoulder and Milanovich returned to his starting role after his suspension. Cummings saw no action in Maryland's fifth game, a 31–3 loss to Georgia Tech, which knocked the team out of the Top 25 rankings. At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9–6 victory. After the game, head coach Mark Duffner praised Cummings' play, but stopped shy of naming him the starter. Cummings started against Clemson and Louisville, but the offense struggled and Milanovich started the last three games, while Cummings nursed a sore shoulder. Duffner said of Cummings, \"One of our kids said he's a linebacker playing quarterback. On a scramble, when he can slide to get down, he'll try to run over a kid for extra yards. We've still got to get some of that out of him, but you've got to love that toughness.\" Because he felt his arm needed the rest, Cummings did not play college or amateur baseball in 1996 for the first time since he was ten years old.\nIn 1996, he played in nine games and completed 92 of 173 attempts for 1,127 yards, seven touchdowns, and nine interceptions. With the graduation of Milanovich, Cummings became the uncontested starter backed up by redshirt freshman Ken Mastrole. Cummings suffered a concussion and separated shoulder when hit by three Virginia defenders. He returned to start at West Virginia with a separated shoulder, but played poorly and reaggravated his injury. Against Wake Forest, Cummings played \"a brilliant first half\", but suffered another concussion. During halftime, he collapsed in the locker room. He was hospitalized and suffered a 24-hour bout of uncontrollable vomiting. Mastrole served as his replacement for two games until breaking his collarbone against Duke. Keon Russell, a transfer from American International College who intended to switch to receiver, filled in as the quarterback. In the season finale against Florida State, Cummings was knocked down 19 times, including eight sacks, and pulled himself from the game. Maryland finished the season with either zero or one touchdowns in seven of its last nine games, and Duffner was fired with a 20–35 record. He was replaced by Ron Vanderlinden who installed a multiple offense.\nIn 1997, he played in eleven games and completed 154 of 255 attempts for 1,760 yards, ten touchdowns, and six interceptions. In 1997, Cummings again entered the season atop the depth chart, selected by the new coaching staff over Mastrole because of his greater game experience. Vanderlinden said, \"Brian Cummings is good enough for us to win with. Ken Mastrole will be.\" Wake Forest head coach Jim Caldwell said, \"One of my favorite players to watch in the ACC is (Maryland's) Brian Cummings. He is a tough competitor. That first half he almost beat us by himself. He ran around, was elusive and tough to handle.\" Against Wake, Cummings recorded career-highs in completions (27) and attempts (47)."

The Terriers' home games were played at Generoso Pope Athletic Complex and the team is a member of the Northeast Conference.\nIn Glenn Braica's first year as head coach, the Terriers finished 15–15 (10–8 in the NEC). The Terriers made the playoffs as the 5th seed and lost in the quarter-finals to Central Connecticut State University. The Terriers were off to a good start, yet, after the Madison Square Garden Holiday Festival, which included losses to Northwestern University and Davidson College, they seemed to falter. The Terriers hit their low when losing two straight to Long Island University, including the Battle of Brooklyn game at home. After those loses, the Terriers picked themselves up and finished the regular season strong winning their last four games against conference teams.\nUnder Braica, the Terriers increased their scoring by more than six points per game from the previous season and were one of the best teams in the country in taking care of the basketball, averaging a conference-low 13.3 turnovers per game. The team also led the NEC with 7.80 steals per game.\nPreseason.\nBraica was busy signing his first class, which include: 6' guard Dre Calloway, 6' 4\" guard/forward Travis Nichols, 6' guard Adam Chmielewski, 6' 8\" power forward Matt Milk, and 6' 2\" shooting guard Ben Mockford.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| NEC tournament\nNotes.\nAkeem Bennett and Ricky Cadell were named to the Second Team All-Conference Squad.

The competition was won by Australia, who defeated host nation England 2–1 in the final. West Germany finished third after defeating the Soviet Union.\nEngland, as hosts – and also as Olympic bronze medallists – were viewed as having quite a tough group, containing Olympic champions Pakistan, and a highly fancied Dutch side, with the Soviet Union seen as potential dark-horse outsiders. But in the event Pakistan failed badly, winning only a single group match against minnows New Zealand – blaming their poor play on failure to adjust to the AstroTurf surface, used in a major hockey tournament for the first time instead of grass. The Soviets scored surprise victories over both Pakistan and England, leaving England in danger of going out of their own tournament in the group stages: however they recovered to win their final match, against the Dutch. This left England, the USSR and the Netherlands all level on points with four wins and one loss each. England and the Soviets were equal on goal difference as well as points, England being ahead on goals scored: the Dutch unfortunate to be in third thanks to an inferior goal difference to both.\nIn the other group, things were expected to be more straightforward, with West Germany and Australia (Olympic silver medallists and fourth place respectively) being the two favourites. Australia duly topped the group by defeating everybody except the Germans, with whom they drew: the Germans also finished the group undefeated to qualify comfortably in second place, though they also drew with Spain and India. The latter, hockey giants of the past, were nowhere near the same force in the present: in the play-offs for the minor places, India ended up losing both matches, including the 11th–12th place play-off to the otherwise hapless Pakistan.\nThe first semi-final, between England and West Germany, was an absolute classic. A replay of the semi-final of the 1984 Olympic tournament, won 1–0 by the Germans, meant that the English had a score to settle. England dominated most of the first half, but in the end had only one goal to show for it, scored by star centre-forward Sean Kerly. In the second half, the Germans found their form, equalising from a penalty corner, and then going into the lead with a smart strike from their captain, Heiner Dopp. The remainder of the match was end-to-end stuff as England pressed hard for an equaliser. Several times they came close from both open play and penalty corners: shots whizzed past the post, crosses were desperately intercepted, the keeper himself made a few useful saves – but the Germans were themselves dangerous on the breakaway. Fischer thought he had scored a German third from a penalty corner, but it was disallowed as the ball flew dangerously high off his stick: Dopp, too, nearly scored another, but was denied by a last-ditch deflection from England's own captain, Richard Dodds. Finally, in the last minute, with England on the verge of going out, they were awarded a penalty corner, from which Paul Barber scored an equalizer – almost blocked by a German stick, but it deflected into the roof of the net, forcing extra time. The extra period was as thrilling as the last minutes of the main game, both sides going for all-out attack: the game was finally settled by another English penalty corner, from which Barber scored an action-replay of his earlier goal to send England into the final.\nThe second semi-final, after all that, was an anti-climax, Australia hammering the Soviet Union by 5–0. The Soviets made a slightly better fist of the third-place play-off against the Germans, but in the end it was the Germans who clinched third place.\nThe final was also a rematch of sorts – England having defeated Australia in the Olympic third-place play-off, the Aussies were out for revenge. England started slowly, and Terry Walsh scored an early goal to put Australia into a deserved lead. England soon began to find their feet, with some typically mazy dribbles by Imran Sherwani threatening the Australian lines: but another goal soon followed for the Australians, this time against the run of play, from a penalty corner. This goal was in fact briefly disputed by England, who claimed that the shot had flown too high, above the back board of the net: but the referee ruled that it had brushed the goalkeeper's glove on the way, so the \"too high\" was counted as a deflection off an English player rather than a straight hit from the Australian scorer, and England were 2–0 behind at half-time. The second half was a more scrappy affair – England by and large having the greater amount of possession, but unable to create any significant chances against a well-drilled Australian defensive line. Late on in the game, a defensive error finally allowed Jon Potter in to score, but it was too little, too late: Australia hung on for a 2–1 victory.\nResults.\nClassification round.\nFirst to fourth place classification.\nFinal.\nAustralia&lt;br&gt;\nNeil Snowden, John Bestall, Craig Davies, David Bell (capt), Warren Birmingham, Treva King, Grant Mitton (sub Dean Evans), Colin Batch, Terry Walsh, Ric Charlesworth, Neil Hawgood (sub Peter Haselhurst)\nEngland&lt;br&gt;\nIan Taylor, David Faulkner, Paul Barber, Jon Potter, Richard Dodds (capt), Martyn Grimley, Stephen Batchelor (sub Kulbir Bhaura), Richard Leman (sub John Shaw), Sean Kerly, Norman Hughes, Imran Sherwani"

This was the first time that William Hill sponsored the event.\nJohn Higgins was the defending champion, but he lost in the second round 4–6 against Stephen Maguire.\nJudd Trump won his second ranking title by defeating Mark Allen 10–8 in the final.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nControversy.\nThe format of the 2011 UK Championship was changed from previous editions. All rounds up to the quarter-finals were played as best of 11 frames instead of best of 17 frames. The semi-finals and the final were played as best of 17 and best of 19 frames respectively. The changes allowed for every match in the early rounds to be played in front of television cameras and avoided the need to use two extra tables. However, the changes angered some players including John Higgins, and Mark Williams, while Mark Allen called for Barry Hearn to resign as head of World Snooker, after Hearn had promised not to alter the championship when he had become the chairman in 2010. During the same interview Allen aimed a four lettered expletive at Hearn. Allen was later charged by World Snooker for bringing the game into disrepute. Hearn, following the original comments by Allen, called him a \"silly little boy\", to which Allen responded by gagging himself at a press conference. Allen and Hearn later sat down and had a discussion, which resolved their differences, while Allen was fined £250 for swearing in a press conference.\nQualifying.\nThese matches were held between 5 and 9 November 2011 at the South West Snooker Academy, Gloucester, England.\nBest of 11 frames"

        "title": "Trojans Rugby Football Club",
        "text": "The Trojans Rugby Football Club is an under-nineteen-year-old rugby club originally based out of Lassiter High School. It is one of the original high school rugby clubs which are part of the Georgia High School Rugby Association (GHSRA). The club was founded in 2005, and has made its mark on rugby in Georgia. Matches and practices are held at Noonday Creek Park in Marietta. Coach Randall Joseph has been the head coach since the club's founding, with John Green, Winston Daniels and Michael Murrell as assistant coaches. The club has taken park in many tournaments and state final matches in Georgia and the Southeast United States. A major goal of the Trojans Rugby Football Club is to teach and play the sport of rugby in the United States. This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors. The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby. Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age. In the summer of 2011, the Trojan Rugby Football Club took part in another version of rugby called rugby sevens. This variation of rugby is faster paced, with the same size fields but fewer people, and shorter half lengths.\nLocation, practices and games.\nNoonday Creek Park serves as the Trojans Rugby Football Club's home pitch. Although Lassiter High School is associated with the Trojans Rugby Football Club they do not permit the club to use fields at the school. Noonday Creek Park is located off Shallowford Rd., and at 489 Hawkins Store Rd., NE, Kennesaw, GA, 30144. The park has been part of high school rugby in Georgia since the first game was played there on March 4, 2005. Most practices and all home games for the Trojans take place at this park. Although Fall is the off season, practices currently occur every Wednesday at 4:45pm on field 13. During the formal spring season practices are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5pm and games are typically played on Friday nights. When the park is closed, practices are held on the field at McCleskey Middle School, located at 4080 Maybreeze Road Marietta, Georgia, 30066.\nHistory.\nThe Trojans Rugby Football Club began as one of the first three high school rugby teams in Georgia, in 2005. To create these teams the coaches got together and used the graduate thesis, \"The Bryant Model.\" This graduate thesis was written by Phillip C. Bryant, MBA, to provide a manual to starting a high school rugby club. After the first year the Trojans Rugby Football Club had earned a State Championship title for beating Pope High School's team 23-19. By the next season in 2006, the Georgia High School Rugby Association had created two divisions due to the increase in teams. The Trojan Rugby Football Club was placed in the Cobb County Division along with the Pope High School, the Sequoyah High School, and the Campbell High School Rugby Football Clubs. In the 2006 season, the Trojan Rugby Football Club lost all of their games to the other teams in the Cobb County Division. The club entered the 2007 season with growing numbers of new competition and notable performance. At the season's end the Trojans Rugby Football Club had an 11-1 record with the one loss coming from a defeat in the Southeast Tournament, by the Rummel Raiders Rugby Club of New Orleans, Louisiana. The club earned a second State Championship title after defeating the Alpharetta Phoenix Rugby Football Club, and participated in its first Southeast Tournament. In 2008, the club added to their success with yet another State Championship title and traveled to Nashville, Tennessee to play in the 2008 Southeast Tournament. The State Championship match was won in over time against the Alpharetta Phoenix Rugby Football Club with a final score of 17-15. For the second year in a row, the Trojans finished with an 11-1 record, only losing in the Southeast Championship Final match to the Jesuit High School Rugby Club from New Orleans, Louisiana. The 2009 and 2010 carried on their winning traditions by finishing those seasons undefeated in state play, due to Phoenix playing illegal players who were over the age limits during the 2009 and 2010 state title games. In the 2010 season, the Trojans passed up the opportunity to play for the Southeast title and allowed Phoenix to go in their place, Phoenix eventually moved to Nationals. In 2011 the Trojans again took the Georgia Rugby State Champion title from Alpharetta Phoenix. The Trojan Rugby Football Club ended their 2011 spring regular season 8-0 and beat Phoenix Club 55-14 in the State Championship match at Walton High School. The Trojans attended the Southeast Championship in Sanford, Florida the weekend of April 30, 2011. Out of all of the teams attending, the Trojans were seated first overall for the tournament. The morning of Saturday, April 30 the Trojans won their first match against Brother Martin, from Louisiana, 27-0. Later that day the Trojans suffered their first loss of 2011 against Raleigh Rattlesnakes, from North Carolina, 12-26. On Sunday the Trojans lost their final match to the Tampa Barbarians, from Florida, 5-18, earning themselves the sixth-place position of the tournament. In 2016, the Trojans combined with local Pope and Walton high school rugby teams to form \"East Cobb Rugby Club\".\nRecord.\nTrojans Rugby Football Club Record: 51 matches won and 6 matches lost with no draws. Along with a winning streak against competition inside the state of GA stretching from 2006-2011. Updated on 27 September 2011.\nNotable players.\nHanno Dirksen"

Due to a major conference realignment that significantly impacted the Big 12, It was the first tournament with 10 teams participating. After the 2010–11 season, Colorado left for the Pac-12 and Nebraska joined the Big Ten. It was also the final appearance in this event for Texas A&amp;M and Missouri before they joined the Southeastern Conference for the 2012–13 season. The conference will continue to have 10 schools in that season, as TCU and West Virginia will join the Big 12, respectively from the Mountain West Conference and Big East Conference.\nThe tournament, and the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament that went with it, was won by one of the departing members, Missouri.\nRadio Coverage.\nAll teams were able to have their local radio media groups carry their games in the Big 12 Tournament. Additionally, the tournament semifinals and championship game were broadcast on select regional ESPN Radio affiliates and nationally on ESPNRadio.com. This was a change from years past, in which ESPN Radio would broadcast the games nationally. However due to the ACC's contract with ESPN now being in effect, ESPN Radio affiliates must choose whether they want to carry the Big 12 semis and championship or carry the entire ACC Tournament.\nSeeding.\nThe Tournament consisted of a 10 team single-elimination tournament with the top 6 seeds receiving a bye.\nSchedule.\nThe semi-finals were produced by, and aired on, the Big 12 Network in Big 12 Network territories.

        "title": "2012–13 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2012–13 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Butler University in the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Brad Stevens, serving his 6th year. The Bulldogs played their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 10,000. This was the first year that Butler competed in the Atlantic 10 Conference, as they moved from the Horizon League following the 2011–12 season. The Bulldogs returned all but three players, including Chase Stigall, who was a part-time starter in 2011-2012, and Roosevelt Jones, who \"was a top flight recruit and did not disappoint [with] 7.8 points and a team high 6.0 rebounds last season.\"\nThey finished the season 27–9, 11–5 in A-10 play to finish in a three-way tie for third place. They advanced to the semifinals of the Atlantic 10 tournament where they lost to Saint Louis. They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA tournament where they defeated Bucknell in the second round before losing in the third round to Marquette.\n2012–13 was Butler's first and only season in the Atlantic 10 as they joined the so-called \"Catholic 7\", along with Creighton and Xavier, in the new incarnation of the Big East Conference in July 2013.\nOff season.\nThe Bulldogs left the Horizon League, of which it had been a founding member in 1979. The move to the Atlantic 10 Conference was announced on May 29, 2012, after earlier plans to move for the 2013–14 season were accelerated. Athletic Director Barry Collier explained, \"Since announcing our intention to depart after 2012-13, Butler and the Horizon League have discussed the terms for next season. Ultimately, it was in our best interest to reach an agreement with the Horizon League for immediate departure.\" ESPN reported the move was because the Bulldogs \"weren't going to be allowed to play in the [Horizon League conference tournament] so the choice was obvious – bolt to the A-10.\" ESPN further contended that \"They will compete for the regular-season and conference tournament titles.\"\nOver the summer, Butler added statistician Drew Cannon to the coaching staff. According to \"Sports Illustrated\", it was \"the first pure statistics-based hire\" in college basketball.\nRegarding the team's potential success for the 2012–13 season, ESPN analyst Eamonn Brennan posited, \"It's fair to expect a drastic uptick in perimeter efficiency from this offense, and the same baseline defensive strength. If that's the case, there's no reason this group can't make a run at its first A-10 title in its very first opportunity.\" Jon Rothstein of CBS New York noted \"The Bulldogs are much better suited to make the jump to the Atlantic 10 with [Roosevelt Jones] in their starting lineup. With brute strength and burgeoning point forward skills, Jones showed flashes of brilliance as a freshman, accumulating four double-doubles during the course of Butler’s season. Expect that number to at least double in 12-13.\"\nOn September 12, Coach Stevens announced junior guard Chrishawn Hopkins was dismissed from the team for violation of team rules. \"I am sorry to have to announce that Chrishawn Hopkins has been dismissed from our team,\" he said. \"We consider it a privilege to represent Butler University as a member of our team. With that privilege, comes a requirement and responsibility to meet the standard of our team rules. Dismissal is the consequence of a failure to do so.\" Hopkins, who was one of four returning starters, played in all 37 games during the 2011–12 season including 24 as a starter. Hopkins was expected to be the starting point guard. Two months later, Chris Harrison-Docks quit the team prior to the first regular season game.\n2012 recruiting class.\nESPN included Butler's 2012 recruiting class among its top recruiting classes from teams in non-BCS conferences, noting recruit Kellen Dunham was listed as an ESPN Top 100 recruit and is \"a sniper to run off screens and create movement in the halfcourt sets for the next four years.\" In addition to Kellen Dunham, ESPN listed Devontae Morgan as \"a playmaking combo guard\" and Chris Harrison-Docks as a \"more prototypical point.\" ESPN gave the class an overall grade of B+, tied as the second highest rating among teams in the Atlantic 10.\nIn ESPN's scouting report, Kellen Dunham was listed as the 78th best overall player, due in large part to the fact that what he \"does really well is shoot the basketball. How he goes about his business is akin to a master craftsman applying his trade. Dunham is in constant motion, working to get himself in position to score and he's typically shot-ready.\" Dunham's reputation as an excellent shooter was further emphasized by Rivals listing him as the best shooter among all recruits of non-BCS teams. Devontae Morgan's scouting report from ESPN listed him as \"a combination guard that is a excellent open court passer especially in draw and kick situations... Morgan is also a very capable of defending both guard positions as well.\" Finally, ESPN's scouting report lists Chris Harrison-Docks as \"a tough competitor, dogged defender and unafraid of taking contact in the paint off penetration when driving into the lane for creative finishes\" and further states that \"He is a winner and the type of point guard you want on a championship level team.\"\nAlso new to the team in the 2012–13 season is transfer Rotnei Clarke, a guard from Oklahoma who sat out the 2011–12 season after transferring from Arkansas. Clarke is considered one of the season's top 50 players, in large part because of his 3-point shot, which averaged 43% in his last season at Arkansas. Clarke is held, along with Dunham, as a potential solution to Butler's struggles during the previous season. \"Butler shot 27.2 percent from 3-point range; only four teams in Division I were worse. Fortunately, help is on the way. Arkansas transfer Rotnei Clarke, who averaged 43 percent from 3 and scored 15.2 points per game as a junior, is eligible to compete this fall, and Indiana native Kellen Dunham is a top-100 recruit known for one trait above all else: prodigious outside shooting. It's fair to expect a drastic uptick in perimeter efficiency from this offense, and the same baseline defensive strength. If that's the case, there's no reason this group can't make a run at its first A-10 title in its very first opportunity.\"\nRegular season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Atlantic 10 Conference Play\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Atlantic 10 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| 2013 NCAA Tournament\nClarke injury.\nDuring the game at Dayton on January 12, Rotnei Clarke was fouled in mid-air by Dayton's Matt Derenbecker and was thrown head-first into the base of the backboard support. \"Clarke remained down on the court for almost eight minutes before being taken off the floor via stretcher, flashing a thumbs up to the crowd as he left.\" Before leaving the court, Clarke was overheard initially saying \"I can't move\" before reporting numbness in his hands. Clarke later recalled, \"I feel blessed to be walking. When I hit my head, I rolled over and I couldn’t feel anything from my neck down. That’s what scared me the most. My body was just tingling.\" Clarke gave a \"thumbs-up\" sign as he was wheeled off the court en route to Miami Valley Hospital where it was confirmed he had a sprained neck, no fractures, and no spinal cord damage. Derenbecker was assessed a flagrant foul. After the game, Derenbecker described his interaction with Butler's Coach Stevens during the post-game handshake: \"I said 'Coach, please tell Rotnei it was not on purpose.' And he said, 'Matt, I know it wasn't on purpose. Don't worry.' It felt good to know that a coach of his caliber was able to realize that it wasn't a dirty play.\""

He has been enshrined in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame as part of its Class of 2003, and in February 2009 was chosen to the Tennessee All-Century Team, commemorating the greatest 20 players in program history.\nHigh school.\nA native of Greenfield, Indiana, Edwards starred at Greenfield High School from 1965–66 to 1968–69.

His 36.4 points per game average in 1968–69 led the state and he was named a high school All-American. Edwards earned the nickname the \"Greenfield Gunner\" for his shooting and scoring abilities. When it came to his decision to play for the Volunteers, Tennessee's head coach Ray Mears offered Edwards a scholarship without even having seen him play competitively in person. Mears was attending a coaching clinic at Ball State University and told Edwards to take some jump shots from the perimeter. Edwards impressed Mears, and the next fall he was enrolled at the school.\nCollege and later life.\nDue to NCAA eligibility rules at the time, college freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports. Edwards played for Tennessee's freshman team in 1969–70 and averaged 30.1 points per game on the team. He was able to play varsity from his sophomore through senior years, and in just three seasons he scored 1,343 points in 77 career games. He scored 572 field goals on 1,265 attempts during an era when no three-point field goal line existed. As a pure jumpshooter, Edwards later claimed that it \"would have been interesting\" to see how many more points he would have scored if a three-point line had existed.\nIn his first varsity season the Volunteers earned a berth into the 1971 National Invitation Tournament, reaching the quarterfinals before bowing out to Duke, 74–68. They finished in second place in the SEC with a 13–5 conference record. The following year, Edwards helped lead Tennessee to an SEC regular season co-championship with Kentucky behind a 14–4 conference record. They did not qualify for any postseason tournament, although Edwards was named the co-SEC Player of the Year. In addition, he was named an Academic All-American. In 1972–73, Edwards final season, the Volunteers tied for second place with two other schools and once again failed to earn any postseason berths. Edwards concluded his collegiate career with a second consecutive All-SEC First Team selection as well as a third consecutive Academic All-SEC selection.\nAfter college he played professionally in Mexico before officially retiring from basketball. He then got into coaching, first at various high schools and then at Emory and Henry College, Maryville College and finally Carson–Newman University. Eventually he switched careers and now is a high school teacher at William Blount High School in Maryville, Tennessee , having formerly taught at Farragut High School in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nOn June 9, 1973 he married Debra J. McCulley of Maryville, TN."

        "text": "Founded by Paul St. John in 2011, the Canadian Lacrosse League (CLax) was a men's semi-professional indoor lacrosse league based exclusively in Ontario, Canada. CLax ceased operation on August 31, 2016 after the league's single-entity ownership group, Charlesway Corporation Limited and Rodney 'Demon' Hill, deemed the league's business model to be no longer viable.\nSimilar to the National Lacrosse League, and unlike other Canadian box lacrosse leagues that play in the summer, CLax played its regular season games in the winter with its playoff games and championship culminating in the early spring. CLax opened its inaugural season with six teams in three cities: Brampton Inferno and Peel Avengers in Brampton, Ontario; the Iroquois Ironmen and Ohsweken Demons in Hagersville, Ontario; and the Durham TurfDogs and Oshawa Machine in Oshawa, Ontario.\nHistory.\nThe league's original intentions were to feature eastern and western leagues. This plan was modified to have multiple Ontario teams and one Quebec location in the first year.\nThe first three teams announced were franchises in Ohsweken, Peterborough, and Montreal. A \"Brampton Guardian\" article listed a team in London. Of the original three, only Oshweken wound up with an actual team in the 2012 season. With only three teams, the league decided two teams should operate in each announced location, leading to the creation of the Iroquois Ironmen, Peel Avengers, and Durham TurfDogs. Rodney Hill operated the two Oshweken teams, but the league owned the other clubs initially.\nThe inaugural games took place January 7, 2012 starting in Ohsweken. The first game was an 18–11 win for the Brampton Inferno over the hometown Iroquois Ironmen. In the second game, the Peel Avengers defeated the Durham TurfDogs 16–9. To conclude the opening day of league play, the Oshawa Machine played the Ohsweken Demons, losing 13–9.\nIt was announced on October 3, 2012 that the league would be expanding to three new markets: Barrie, Toronto, and St. Catharines. The Oshawa Machine would be moving to Toronto to become the Toronto Shooting Stars; the Peel Avengers would relocate to St. Catharines and the city of Barrie would be awarded an expansion team. It was also announced that the Durham Turf Dogs would be changing their name to the Oshawa Turf Dogs.\nIn November 2013, the defending champion Iroquois Ironmen announced that they were ceasing operations and would no longer compete in CLax. That was followed in December with the news of 2013 finalists, Toronto Shooting Stars also folding. The Brampton Inferno would become a touring team based out of Southwestern Ontario called the SouthWest Cyclops for 2014."

It is a spin-off series of the \"Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū\" (\"Power Pros\") franchise.\nGames.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2004\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2004 (プロ野球スピリッツ2004, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2004\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami for the PlayStation 2 that was released on March 25, 2004.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2 (プロ野球スピリッツ2, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami for the PlayStation 2 that was released on April 7, 2005.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 3\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 3 (プロ野球スピリッツ3, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 3\") is a baseball simulation game designed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 systems. The game was released on April 6, 2006 and is developed and published by Konami.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 4\".\nProfessional Baseball Spirits 4 (プロ野球スピリッツ4, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 4\") is a baseball video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 in Japan on May 1, 2007. It is the sequel of \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 3\".\nGameplay overview.\nThe game features all 12 Nippon Professional Baseball teams, and both the Pacific League and Central League All-Star teams (circa 2006, but with changes made for traded and/or retired players).\nThe difficulty level for the game is adjustable. The easiest mode will appeal to younger players who have probably never played a baseball game before in their lives, and the hardest mode—known as Spirits Mode—will give even the most experienced and advanced players a challenge with superior AI. Other modes can be selected in a sort of pseudo-gameplay sliders mode. For instance, gameplay speed can be increased, as well as pitch speed (which can be set to \"real\" speed).\nThe basic batting interface is a silhouette of a bat which influences how the ball will travel. Depending on when and where contact was made, that influences where the ball goes. The pitching is a 2-click system where the player selects his pitch around a grid, presses X to start his delivery, then pressing X as one circle converges on another to try and perfectly time the pitch.\nReception.\nAround the time of its release, it was the only PlayStation 3 video game that was among the top 50 best-selling video games in Japan.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 5\".\nProfessional Baseball Spirits 5 (プロ野球スピリッツ5, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 5\") is a baseball video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 in Japan on May 1, 2008. It is the sequel to Professional Baseball Spirits 4.\nImprovements and Additions.\nOn the PlayStation 3 version of Pro Yakyū Spirits 5, the game saw many small improvements. The graphics were enhanced further from the previous incarnation, but the major fixes were in the gameplay. First of all, the load times that plagued the previous game were fixed, meaning less of the \"black screens\" that were used for short load times in PYS4. The game also has more of a television-style presentation, new animations for slap hits, and a new meter that tells players what pitch the CPU batter is expecting.\nThe new mode in PYS5 which replaces the MVP Mode in the previous game is Stardom Mode. It plays like a full-fledged Career Mode, where a player can either take control of an existing player or create their own player to go through a maximum of 20 years of play. Experience points are distributed on how well the player does in his at-bat.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 5 Kanzenban\".\nOn December 4, 2008, Konami released a new, updated version of Pro Yakyū Spirits 5, with the subtitle \"\"Kanzenban\",\" which means \"Perfect Version.\" Priced at 8000 yen (US$88) and released on both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, Kanzenban touted many improvements over the original as a post-season version of the game. For instance, every player who appeared in a game in the 2008 NPB season for all 12 teams was included on each team's roster, there were new player animations, enhanced artificial intelligence, and also small improvements to graphics (foreign players, for example, no longer look generic and have their actual swings), online play, baserunning, and fielding.\n\"Kanzenban\" marked the first time since \"Pro Yakyu Spirits 2004 Climax\" that a PYS game had been re-made for a post-season version, similar to that of the \"Ketteiban\" games in Pro Yakyu Spirits' sister series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 6\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 6 (プロ野球スピリッツ6, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 6\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 that was released on July 16, 2009.\nNew Features.\nThe new major mode in the game for this season is the World Baseball Classic mode. Upon booting the game, the first menu is to decide whether the player wants to play the WBC mode or the regular Pro Yakyuu Spirits game. The rosters are accurate for all WBC teams, and it is possible to play an entire tournament as any of the 16 teams.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2010\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2010 (プロ野球スピリッツ2010, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2010\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable that was released on April 1, 2010.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2011\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2011 (プロ野球スピリッツ2011, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2011\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo 3DS that was released on April 14, 2011.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2012\".\nPro Yakyuu Spirits 2012(プロ野球スピリッツ2012, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2012\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami Digital Entertainment and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 that was released on March 29, 2012.\nResume.\nThe previous version was released on the 3DS, but publishers have decided to give preference to PlayStation Vita.\nThe announced release date, is the same for all announced platforms, and is timed to the launch of a new baseball season.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2013\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2013 (プロ野球スピリッツ2013, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2013\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita that was released on March 20, 2013.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2014\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2014 (プロ野球スピリッツ2014, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2014\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita that was released on March 20, 2014.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2015\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2015 (プロ野球スピリッツ2015, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2015\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita that was released on March 26, 2015.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits A\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits A (プロ野球スピリッツA, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits Ace\") is a mobile baseball video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for iOS and Android that was released on October 21, 2015. the game has received downloads.\n\"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2019\".\nProfessional Yakyuu Spirits 2019 (プロ野球スピリッツ2019, \"Pro Yakyū Spirits 2019\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita that was released on July 18, 2019.\n\"eBaseball Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2021: Grand Slam\".\neBaseball Professional Yakyuu Spirits 2021: Grand Slam (eBaseball プロ野球スピリッツ2021, \"eBaseball Pro Yakyū Spirits 2021\") is a baseball simulation video game developed by Konami and PawaPuro Productions for the Nintendo Switch that was released on July 8, 2021."

During the 1980s and 1990s, he played in the Netherlands but is better known for his collegiate career at Middle Tennessee State University. Between 1978–79 and 1981–82, Beck scored 1,401 points, grabbed 782 rebounds and was twice named the Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In addition, Beck was selected three straight years to the All-OVC First Team.\nA multi-position player who primarily switched between small forward and power forward, Beck led the Blue Raiders to the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 1982. In a first round match-up against perennial title contender Kentucky, he recorded a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds to lead MT to arguably its biggest win in school history. They defeated the Wildcats, 50–44, thereby spoiling a much-anticipated second round match-up between Kentucky and Louisville. The Blue Raiders lost to Louisville by 25 points the following game.\nYears later, in a \"Murfreesboro Post\" column that ranked the top ten men's basketball players in MT history, they selected Beck as the #1 greatest player. Following college, the Milwaukee Bucks selected him in the fourth round (89th overall) in the 1982 NBA draft, although Beck decided to play internationally in the Netherlands. He played in the Netherlands until age 42, at which point he retired and became a permanent resident in Amsterdam."

However, desiring to represent only Catalonia and not the entirety of Spain, the Catalonia team was denied RLEF membership and disappeared from international competition shortly afterwards.\nRugby league in Spain began once again in 2013, with a national body (Asociación Española de Rugby League) being formed and admitted to the RLEF by the end of that year. The first Spanish domestic competition kicked off in 2013 with clubs based in the Valencian Community, and the national team played its first match on May 25, 2014, defeating Belgium in Brussels. The first captain was Aitor Davila and the first Spanish try at international level was scored by Gonzalo Morro.\n2017 Rugby League World Cup.\nQualifying.\nOn 9 May 2015, Spain and Latvia kicked off proceedings for the qualifying fixtures for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifying. It was a do or die match with the winner advancing to a qualifying group stage, already containing Malta and Greece, while the other would lose their chance of qualifying for their first ever World Cup. The Spaniards were the better team, winning the match by 20 points which therefore made them advance to the European C qualifying group stage. The team ended up winning the tournament and now advance to the final round robin tournament. In the final phase of qualifying, Spain took on Italy and Ireland, however two losses in those matches saw them miss out in their bid to qualify for their first ever Rugby League World Cup.\nCurrent squad.\nThe 22-man national team squad selected for the first match day of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup European play-off tournament.\nCompetitive record.\nOverview.\n\"International record for the Spain national team as of 29 September 2022.\"\nHonours.\nEuropean Bowl: 2015"

In four Paralympics, Scott has won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics and gold medals at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Paralympics.\nPersonal.\nScott was born on 3 March 1982. On 6 June 1998 as a 16-year-old, he became a quadriplegic due to a car crash on a country road en route to Victor Harbor, South Australia. At the time of the accident, he was a year 11 student at Willunga High School. The accident left Scott paralysed from his chest down but he has some movement in his shoulders, back, biceps and forearms. He moved to Brisbane from Adelaide in 2009 due to the warm weather and due to Queensland having a good wheelchair rugby program.\nWheelchair rugby.\nScott took up wheelchair rugby as part of his rehabilitation. Scott said \"I always loved sport and participated in all kinds of sport – soccer, basketball, Aussie rules, pretty much every sport except able-bodied rugby. As a quadriplegic, I didn’t have the upper-body strength to play wheelchair basketball. When I saw wheelchair rugby, that’s when I thought that sport was still possible.\" Scott made his debut for the Australian team 'Steelers' in August 2001. He was a member of the Steelers that came fifth at the 2004 Athens Paralympics. He won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Games in the mixed wheelchair rugby event. He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Games in the mixed wheelchair rugby event.\nHe was a member of the Steelers that finished with the silver medal at the 2010 World Championships and gold medal at the 2014 World Wheelchair Rugby Championships at Odense, Denmark.\nScott captained the Australian team that retained its gold medal at the 2016 Rio Paralympics after defeating the United States 59–58 in the final.\nAt the 2018 World Championships in Sydney, he was a member of the Australian team that won the silver medal after being defeated by Japan 61–62 in the gold medal game.\nDuring his career he was co-captain and captain of the Steelers (2012–2016) and played for the Suncorp Queensland Cyclones in the Wheelchair Rugby National League.\nScott said \"because of wheelchair rugby I’ve been able to travel the world playing a team sport, I have represented my county at three Paralympic Games, which is huge. It has also made me a much more independent person.\"\nIn September 2018, after 288 Steelers games, he announced his retirement from international wheelchair rugby."

        "text": "In baseball, completing the cycle is the accomplishment of hitting a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a \"natural cycle\", which has occurred five times in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). The cycle itself is rare in NPB, occurring 76 times since Fumio Fujimura's first cycle during the single league era in 1948. In terms of frequency, the cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter (90 occurrences in NPB history); \"Baseball Digest\" calls it \"one of the rarest feats in baseball\". Hitting for the cycle was not recognized in Japanese professional baseball until former Major League Baseball (MLB) player Daryl Spencer made a remark about it after hitting for the cycle with the Hankyu Braves in 1965. Of the 12 current NPB teams, only the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles have never had at least one player hit for the cycle.\nThe most cycles hit by a player in Nippon Professional Baseball is three, accomplished by Bobby Rose. Playing for the Yokohama BayStars, Rose hit his first cycle on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only three other NPB players have hit multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves and Kosuke Fukudome with the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, all with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era. The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five. That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring in two different games on the same day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle is one day shy of 6 years. The drought has lasted from Michihiro Ogasawara's cycle in 2008 until Rainel Rosario's in 2014.\nNo player has ever hit a cycle in both the Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa hit his cycle with the Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to hit a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa hit his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game 2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not considered an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple in the first inning and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Six players achieved their cycles by acquiring a required hit during extra innings. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle. Hiroshi Ohshita and Kazuhiko Kondo are the only two players to have hit a walk-off home run to win the game as the final hit of their cycles."

        "text": "Two human polls make up the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.\nAP poll.\nThe Associated Press (AP) preseason poll was released on October 28, 2011. This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll at the end of the regular season are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as \"March Madness\".\nESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775. The preseason poll was released on October 20, 2011.\nPreseason polls.\nVarious publications and news sources release their preseason top 25 months before the season commences."
