        "title": "History of rugby union in New Zealand",
        "text": "Rugby union has a long history in New Zealand. Today, New Zealand holds tier one status with World Rugby.\nEarly history and 19th century.\nPre-Codification Football.\nBefore Europeans arrived in New Zealand, the Māori were playing a ball game called Kī-o-rahi which greatly resembled Australian Rules Football and rugby football. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population.\nVarious codes of football were played in New Zealand in the years following white settlement. Christchurch Football Club, which is now the oldest rugby club in the country, was founded in 1863. It played by its own rules for many years.\nEarly rugby football.\nRugby football was first introduced to New Zealand in 1870 by Charles John Monro, son of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro. He encountered the game while studying at Christ's College Finchley, in East Finchley, London, England, and on his return introduced the game to Nelson College, who played the first rugby union match against Nelson football club on 14 May. A visit to Wellington by Munro later that same year resulted in an organised match between Nelson and Wellington. By the following year, the game had been formalised in Wellington, and subsequently rugby was taken up in Wanganui and Auckland in 1873 and Hamilton in 1874. In 1875, the first representative team was formed, being a combined-clubs Auckland team which toured the South. It is thought that by the mid-1870s, the game had been taken up by the majority of the colony.\nThe latter stages of the 1870s saw the emergence of a more formal structure, with Unions being formed in both Canterbury and Wellington during 1879. In 1882, the first international rugby side toured New Zealand, a New South Wales side that visited both islands during the latter part of the year. Two years later, a New Zealand team visited New South Wales, wearing blue jerseys with a golden fern. The team won all their games. In 1888, the first ever British Isles rugby team tour took place, visiting New Zealand and Australia. The visitors won all their New Zealand games except for one, losing to Auckland. During 1888-89, the New Zealand Native team became the first from a colony to visit Britain. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) was established, to act as the national governing body of the sport. Following the establishment of the national governing body, the first NZRFU national sanctioned tour was undertaken in 1893, when a ten-game tour of Australia was played. The team was captained by Thomas Ellison.\nTwentieth century.\nArrival of Rugby League.\nIn 1905, as New Zealand's rugby union team, the All Blacks, toured Britain, they witnessed first-hand Northern Union games. In 1906, All Black George William Smith, while on his way home, met an Australian entrepreneur, James J. Giltinan to discuss the potential of professional rugby in Australasia.\nIn the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, Albert Henry Baskerville (or Baskiville), was about to recruit a group of players for a professional tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the Wellington Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville's activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.\nA rugby league team, the All Golds was set up, named facetiously after the players' payment. When the All Golds stopped off in Australia, three games were played at the Sydney Showground, against a professional NSW rugby team. These games were played under rugby union laws, as no copies of the Northern Union laws were available. Baskerville was greatly impressed by Dally Messenger, and persuaded him to join the touring party. For this reason, the All Golds are sometimes known as Australasia, rather than New Zealand. Although Messenger was the only Australian in the touring team. The All Golds arrived in Britain late in 1907 having never even seen a match played under the new Northern Union laws.\nThe Originals.\nIn 1902, the governor of New Zealand, the fifth Earl of Ranfurly presented a trophy shield to the Auckland side, who were undefeated in provincial competition that year. The shield became known as the Ranfurly Shield. Three years later, a 1905 New Zealand team, who became known as the \"Originals\", toured the British Isles and France winning all of their games apart from losing the test against Wales. As the team swept through Britain, some of the players took note of how rugby (league) was being played in the North of England. One player, Aucklander George Smith met with Sydney entrepreneur James J. Giltinan on his way home, and discussed the opportunities of such a game. Meanwhile, New Zealander Albert Henry Baskervill had contacted the Northern Union to arrange a New Zealand tour, as he had just read about the game in the Wellington Post. The NZRU discouraged any involvement from its players and officials, nonetheless, a team departed a travelled to Sydney first, and were there labelled the All Golds, a play on All Blacks in reference to the player payments. The team went on to tour England. They played an import role in rugby league.\n1930s.\nThe 1930s saw a period of skill development for rugby in New Zealand. The 1940 All Black tour of South Africa was one of the first sporting events cancelled due to the Second World War. Rugby was however played in services sport, with games being played with South African allies during the North African desert campaign, also, most domestic competitions were suspended during this time. In 1976, the first ever season of the National Provincial Championship (succeeded in 2006 by the Air New Zealand Cup and Heartland Championship) went underway. In its inaugural format, Division One was made up of seven North Island teams and four South Island. The remaining provinces contested a split second division, though South and North teams did not meet each other, instead played their respective Island clubs. There was a separate relegation system in place for each the North and South, ensuring the number of teams from each island.\n1980s to present.\nThe 1981 Springbok Tour, or The Tour, went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. These images were beamed around the world, and looked as though a civil crisis had engulfed New Zealand. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year.\nIn 1987, the NZRFU wrote to the International Rugby Football Board, now known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), requesting the possibility of hosting an inaugural Rugby World Cup. The 1987 World Cup was eventually given to both New Zealand and Australia. The All Blacks made it to the final, where they would meet France. The All Blacks won and were crowned the first ever World Champions. In the 1980s, New Zealand provincial sides participated in the South Pacific Championship, along with teams from Australia and Fiji. In 1992 this type of competition was relaunched as the Super Sixes, and was expanded to the Super 10 later. As rugby entered the professional era in the mid-1990s, along with South Africa and Australia, New Zealand formed SANZAR, which would see them start a trans-national competition, known as the Super 12. The 1996 Super 12 season saw the Auckland Blues finished as champions, whilst the Waikato Chiefs 6th, the Otago Highlanders 8th, the Wellington Hurricanes 9th, and the Canterbury Crusaders 12th. The SANZAR agreement also saw the formation of the Tri Nations Series, a contest between the respective national sides, the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies. The All Blacks won the first series. Beginning in 2012 the series will be Joined with the Argentina Pumas to create The Rugby Championship. New Zealand was supposed to jointly host the 2003 World Cup with Australia, but a disagreement with the IRB saw the tournament given to Australia in its entirety. In 2006, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup.\nSouth Africa tour of 1981.\nThe 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.\nTwo games had to be cancelled. The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.\nThe final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the \"Crazy Biggles Test\". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets. All-Black prop Gary Knight was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.\nMusician Bruce Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour. He was at the University of Otago at the time.\nIt was a tight game, with Allan Hewson, the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25-22. As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:\nThe NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa. Two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.\nThe role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\nA planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled.\nMāori and apartheid.\nNew Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against Māori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by Pākehā (white New Zealanders).\nIn 1970 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed race (All Black) team to tour South Africa, though Maori players traveled as \"honorary whites\". In 1973 a proposed Springbok (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government again relented and allowed a mixed-race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although Pākehā continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the patu squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.\nDuring and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned Pākehā protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focussing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of Pākehā protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly Pākehā prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi."

        "title": "1919–20 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1919–20 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1919–20 NCAA college basketball season. John O'Reilly coached the team in his sixth season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 13-1.\nSeason recap.\nOn-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914–15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses and averaged no more than three road games a year from the 1918–19 season through the 1926–27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum. The 1919–20 teams only road trip outside of Washington was to New York City and Connecticut at the end of the season.\nThe 1918–1919 season had taken place between the second and third waves of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic—the so-called \"Spanish flu\"—and had been shortened to only 10 games. That team had finished with a record of 9–1, and because of the pandemic its players were granted an extra year of college eligibility. As a result, all five starters from the 1918–1919 team returned for the 1919–1920 season, setting the stage for even greater success during the year.\nThe Hoyas home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 25 games at the end of this season, dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916–17 season; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923–24 season. A highlight of the home season at Ryan was the Hoyas upset of North Carolina, considered one of the top teams in the United States at the time. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice again this season, giving the Hoyas a 12-game winning streak against George Washington—ten of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium—dating back to 1915.\nGeorgetown University Law School student Fred Fees, a forward, completed his college basketball career this season. A free-throw shooting specialist in an era when the rules of college basketball allowed teams to choose which player shot its free throws, Fees had exploited his free-throw prowess to establish himself as one of the top scorers in college basketball in the United States in each of his four seasons with the Hoyas. This season he averaged 17.7 points per game and scored a total of 245 points, a career high and half of all the points the team scored. He made 61 field goals this season and shot 123-for-140 (87.9%) from the free-throw line, a free-throw-shooting percentage that remained a school record until 1978. Fees completed his collegiate career with a career average of 16.8 points scored per game, a remarkable record, and had no peer in college basketball of the era; through at least the 2012-13 season it remains the fourth-highest career average in Georgetown men's basketball history. He scored 804 points in the 48 collegiate games he played for Georgetown, and led the team in scoring in 45 of them. During his four years with the Hoyas he scored 45 percent of their points.\nSophomore forward Jack Flavin became a starter this year and, in fact, started all 14 games. An excellent shooter, he averaged 4.7 points per gane, and scored a total of 66 points.\nSophomore guard Andrew \"Andy\" Zazzali played in all 14 games, and continued the strong scoring he had displayed the previous season. He averaged 7.0 points per game and scored a total of 98 points.\nThe team opened the season with an 11-game winning streak, finally losing at Yale. It then closed the season with two wins to finish at 13-1. It tied the 1910-11 team for what was then the largest number of wins in school history, and its .929 winning percentage remains the best in Georgetown men's basketball history. In 1995, the Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively ranked the team sixth in the United States for the 1919–20 season.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933–34 season.\nJunior forward and team captain Bill Dudack later served as the Hoyas head coach during the 1929–30 season.\n1919–20 schedule and results.\nSources\nNote\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so the game against a United States Army team from Camp Humphrey, Virginia, counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1919–20. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951–52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

He etched himself into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record book for blocks; Roberson's 409 career blocks was the third-highest total in Division I history at the time of his graduation, and as of the 2013–14 season it remains the 21st highest. Five different times he recorded 10 or more blocks in a single game, including a career-high 13 against New Hampshire on January 9, 1992. Roberson also scored 1,503 points and grabbed 1,054 rebounds, which were second and first in school history, respectively, at the time of his graduation. Roberson recorded five triple-doubles in his career as well. In his junior and senior seasons he was a two-time All-North Atlantic Conference (NAC) First Team selection, and his senior year in 1991–92 saw him be named the NAC Player of the Year. He averaged 18 points and 11.2 rebounds en route to the award.\nDeath and legacy.\nRoberson went undrafted in the 1992 NBA draft, and less than a year after graduating from the University of Vermont, he was killed in a car accident in his hometown of Buffalo, New York on May 8, 1993. He and his sister, Michelle, were hit head-on in an intersection by a drunk driver. Basketball fans throughout the region were stunned. Roberson's coach, Tom Brennan, said \"Looking back, what really sticks out is the reaction of everyone to Kevin and I mean everyone. As brilliant as Kevin's career was; as electric a player as he was; everyone talked about Kevin as a person.\"\nRoberson was immediately inducted into the University of Vermont Hall of Fame in 1993. The conference player of the year award was later renamed the \"Kevin Roberson America East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year.\" Since fall 1993, there has been an annual Kevin Roberson 5K Memorial Run/Walk dedicated to him. Roberson's jersey number (33) also became the first men's basketball number ever retired by the school."

Defending titlist is Norway.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski , each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually, one at a time, from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If, after eight bullets, there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and, as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib No.10 shoots at lane No.10 regardless of position in race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane five)."

The club went on to win three sudden death matches in a row including the preliminary final over archrivals Parramatta. Parramatta led the match 18–2 with less than 10 minutes of the game left when Canterbury staged one of the greatest comebacks in finals history, scoring three tries to level the match at 18-18. Canterbury then went on to win the game 32–20 in extra-time.\nHe was part of the Canterbury side who lost the 1998 NRL Grand Final to the Brisbane Broncos.

        "text": "The 1913–14 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1913–14 NCAA college basketball season. James Colliflower coached the team in his third season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at the Arcade Rink, also known as the Arcadia and as the Arcade Auditorium, in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 10–6.\nSeason recap.\nSenior forward Ronayne \"Roy\" Waldron was the team captain for the second straight season, a rare honor and the first player so honored in school history. Also for the second straight year, he led the team in scoring; playing in 11 games and starting each of the 11, he scored a total of 79 points, averaging 7.2 points per game. He ended his collegiate career having played in 42 games and started 33 times, scoring 326 points and averaging 7.8 points per game, and he ranks third in scoring among Georgetown players who played between the 1906-07 and 1919-20 seasons. During his four seasons with the team, the Hoyas never had a losing season and were 35–5 on their home court.\nColliflower had coached the Hoyas for three seasons, posting an overall record of 32-17 and shepherding the men's basketball program through disputes over it between the undergraduate campus and the Law School. A part-time coach who made ends meet by attending to his coal delivery business, he stepped down as coach and returned to that business after this season when Georgetown hired John O'Reilly to succeed him as a full-time head coach. When O'Reilly later fell ill and could not coach, Colliflower returned to serve as head coach without pay during the 1921-22 season.\nThe Hoyas began to play their home games at Ryan Gymnasium the following season, so this was the last Georgetown men's basketball team to play its home games off campus until the team left Ryan to return to the Arcade Rink for the 1927-28 season.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\n1913–14 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and games played against the Washington YMCA and the Maryland Athletic Club counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1913–14. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951–52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

The loss at Connecticut that broke the streak on January 20, 1990, was only the second Georgetown loss to the Huskies since 1981.\nSophomore center Alonzo Mourning, touted by many observers upon his arrival the previous season as \"the next Patrick Ewing,\" built upon the great success he enjoyed during his freshman year. He started all 31 games this season, scoring in double figures in 30 of them and averaging 16.5 points per game despite an average of only 8.6 shots per game. He also averaged 8.5 rebounds a game for the year. Against Hawaii Pacific in the second game of the season, he shot 13-for-14 (92.9%) from the free-throw line, the beginning of a school-record-setting season in which he scored in double figures in free throws alone in ten different games and made 220 free throws (out of 281 attempts, a 78.3% effort) on the year as opposing defenses fouled him time and again in an attempt to stop him from scoring inside. In his best games of the year, he had 27 points and 11 rebounds against Virginia Tech, 26 points and 14 rebounds against DePaul, and 20 points and 12 rebounds against Connecticut.\nJunior center Dikembe Mutombo, a reserve player the previous season while he became accustomed to the American college game, played in all 31 games this season and started alongside Mourning in 24 of them, and his average playing time increased from 11 to 26 minutes per game. He averaged 10.5 points and 10.7 rebounds per game for the year. He scored 10 rebounds and blocked 10 shots in the North Carolina game, scored 17 points and had 15 rebounds against Pittsburgh, and scored 22 points and had 18 rebounds against Villanova. In later games of the season, his scoring and rebounding performance increased as he averaged shot 68% from the field and averaged 15 points and 13 rebounds a game.\nAlthough much national attention focused on Mourning and Mutombo, the star of the team arguably was senior guard Mark Tillmon. A starter in his freshman and sophomore years, he had slumped during his junior season and been relegated to the bench. This year, he returned to form, starting all 31 games. In December 1989, he scored 27 points against North Carolina and 29 against Virginia Tech. During the five-game stretch from the victory over Northern Iowa on December 29, 1989, through the defeat of DePaul on January 13, 1990, he averaged 26 points a game, including a career-high 39 points against Providence. As the season wore on, he had 26 points at Villanova, 25 versus Seton Hall, and 20 at St. John's. In the rematch at Providence in February, he tied the career-high 39-point performance he had set against them a month and a half earlier, including connecting on a Georgetown-record seven three-point shots – a record destined to be matched only once over the next 18 years. He scored in double figures in 10 of his final 11 games.\nBack from touring with a Big East all-star team during the summer of 1989, senior guard Dwayne Bryant returned as a team co-captain this season and started all 31 games. With freshman David Edwards playing point guard, Bryant was free to play shooting guard, and he responded with the best offensive season of his collegiate career. He scored in double figures in 21 games, and in the later games of the season averaged 16 points per game, including a 20-point effort against Connecticut and nine rebounds and a career-high 25 points against Syracuse consecutively in the last two games of the regular season. For the year, he averaged a career-best 12.3 points per game.\nThe season finale in which Bryant had his career-high scoring performance at the Carrier Dome before 33,015 against archrival Syracuse – the largest on-campus crowd in NCAA basketball history – was a wild game. Thompson was ejected – only his third ejection since taking over the Georgetown program in 1972 – and the Hoyas clung to a two-point lead with five seconds left in the game and Syracuse having little prospect of making even a long-range shot to tie. However, senior forward and team co-captain Sam Jefferson unnecessarily fouled Syracuse sophomore power forward Billy Owens, who sank both of his free throws to tie the game. Syracuse prevailed in overtime, beating the Hoyas 89–87.\nBeginning with the regular-season-finale loss at Syracuse, the Hoyas stumbled in their final five games, losing three, each of them by five or fewer points. After a bye in the first round of the 1989 Big East tournament, Georgetown defeated Providence in the quarterfinals but lost to Connecticut in the semifinals. The Hoyas were the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region of the 1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 12th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and defeated Texas Southern in the first round before the Midwest Region No. 6 seed, 25th-ranked Xavier, upset them in the second round. In the final seven games of the year, Mourning had been limited to an average of just over six shots per game, and that had hurt the Georgetown offense.\nThe 1989-90 Hoyas were ranked No. 8 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 6 in the final Coaches' Poll. Mark Tillmon and Dwayne Bryant graduated in May 1990, Tillmon having had the best season of his career, averaging 19.8 points per game for the year and 12.7 for his career, and Bryant with a school-record shooting average from three-point range of 39.9%. During their four seasons on the team, the Hoyas had posted a record of 102–24 overall and 53–5 at home.\nRoster.\nSource\nSophomore guard Ronny Thompson was the son of head coach John Thompson Jr.\nRankings.\nSource\n1989–90 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Maccabi Tel Aviv () is a handball club based in Tel Aviv, Israel. They compete in the Israeli Handball Premier League, and host their home games in Tichonet, Tel Aviv. The club is under full ownership of Maccabi Tel Aviv Foundation; its chairman is Eyal Frolinger.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe handball team of Maccabi Tel Aviv was founded in the 1930s when handball was first played in Mandatory Palestine. The club was initially three separate clubs; Maccabi North Tel Aviv, who won three national cups in a row between 1963 and 1965, Maccabi Tel Aviv and Brit Maccabim Atid. Over time the three clubs gradually amalgamated under the name of Maccabi Tel Aviv.\nOver the years, players such as Avraham Shneior, Moshe Resch, Yoav Drucker, Mickey Tenenbaum and Avi Resch played in the team. All these players were also part of the Israeli national team and represented the country in a lot of international tournaments and cups.\nExcept the three State Cups the club won during the 60's, Maccabi Tel Aviv wasn't a successful team in the Israeli handball and considered as a mid-table team for a lot of years. In 1998, the team reached the State Cup final but lost it to Hapoel Rishon Lezion.\n2000s.\nAfter several years as a mid-table team, in 1999 the team started to regrow. The Maccabi Tel Aviv foundation began to invest more money in the handball department, the youth system in the club recovered and there were efforts to bring fans to home games.\nUntil 2009, these attempts were not successful. But this year Maccabi reached the State Cup semi-final, where they lost to the local rivals ASA Tel Aviv. The team finished the season in the fourth place of the league. One year later, the club established its first youth team. In the 2010–11 season, the team finished fifth in the league and was eliminated in the Last 16 round of the State Cup.\nIn 2011–12, Maccabi finished the regular season in the third place and lost to Maccabi Rishon Lezion in the playoffs semi-finals. They were beaten by Hapoel Rishon Lezion in the State Cup final. In the same season they reached the semi-finals of the EHF Challenge Cup, but then lost to the Greek Diomidis Argous. \nThe financial investment in the team grew and they won their first championship in the 2013–14 season, after a sweep in the finals series against Hapoel Rishon Lezion. They did it again two years later, in the 2015–16 season, with Nedeljko Matić as head coach and with Milan Kosanović and Novak Bošković as the foreign players.\nMaccabi started the 2016–17 season by terminating Nedeljko Matić contract, even though he won a championship with the team. They appointed Dragan Đukić as head coach and signed Israeli internationals Chen Pomeranz and Alex Sychenko. Maccabi lost to ABC/UMinho (27–34), but defeated Achilles Bocholt (33–30) in the qualification tournament of the 2016–17 EHF Champions League. As a result, they continued in the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 EHF Cup, where they defeated St. Petersburg HC and qualified, for the first time of their history, to the group stage. They hosted their home games in the group stage at the Drive in Arena."

The attraction of a job as a fitter at Prince Smith &amp; Stell persuaded him to give up his job in the pit and move north.\nKeighley RLFC.\nDavies signed from Welsh side, Bridgend Rugby Football Club in 1936 and went on to play 199 games for Keighley. He made his début 14 April 1936 v Huddersfield Away on the losing team 0-12. The Second World War took away many of his best playing years. In one of the war time fixtures on 7 November 1942, Davies played stand-off for Keighley against Leeds his scrum-half partner was a war time loan player from Warrington fellow Welshman Melville De Lloyd. Also on loan that day was the great Jim Sullivan from Wigan who played an inspirational game at full-back for the Lawkholme Lane club.\nOn 10 April 1943 Davies played in a Challenge Cup semi-final 1st leg at Lawkholme Lane in which Keighley beat Leeds 5-3. Leeds won the second leg 27-0 to qualify to meet Dewsbury in the final.\nYorkshire Cup.\nDavies played right- in Keighley RLFC's 7-10 aggregate defeat by Bradford Northern in the 1943 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1943–44 Wartime Emergency League season, the 2-5 defeat at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 27 November 1943, and the 5-5 draw at Lawkholme Lane, Keighley on Saturday 4 December 1943.\nChampionship final appearances.\nWhile on leave from the Army in 1941-42 season, Davies was signed as a guest player for Bradford Northern, when regular Donald Ward was injured.

Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Tech Gymnasium on the campus of McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C., except for one home game it played at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. It finished with a record of 5-16.\nSeason recap.\nAfter the Hoyas disappointing 13-12 record the previous season, Georgetown had hired Colrick from his \"alma mater\", Notre Dame, to serve as a football assistant and, following that, to take over as the Hoyas head basketball coach. At Notre Dame, he had assisted head coach George Keogan; employing an up-tempo offense known as the \"Western-style\" offense, Keogan never had a losing season in his 20 years as Notre Dames head coach between 1923 and 1943. Georgetowns athletics department hoped that Colrick would bring a successful version of the \"Western-style\" offense to Georgetown, but the team instead performed very poorly, finishing with a record of 5-16. Its .238 winning percentage was the worst in Georgetown men's basketball history until the 1971-72 team finished with a 3-23 record and .115 winning percentage.\nColrick left Georgetown shortly after the end of the season and spent a single season coaching basketball at Seton Hall the following year. His career after that is obscure.\nGeorgetown deemphasized sports during the 1930s, and this season began a period of mediocrity in Georgetown basketball that stretched throughout the decade. From the beginning of this season through the end of the 1939-1940 season, Georgetown would have a combined record of 32 games under .500, with only three winning seasons.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

Bill Dudack coached it in his first and only season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and, after playing its first two games at Clendenen Gymnasium on the campus of American University in Washington, D.C. – its home court the previous season – played its home games at Tech Gymnasium on the campus of Washington, D.C.s McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C., the first Georgetown team to use Tech Gymnasium as its home court. It played one home game later in the season at Brookland Gymnasium on the campus of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.\nSeason recap.\nBill Dudack was a 1921 Georgetown graduate who had played for four years on the varsity basketball team, beginning with the 1917-18 season and had lettered for the 1918-19, 1919-20, and 1920-21 teams. He had also been captain of the 1919-1920 team. He had served as an assistant to head coach to Elmer Ripley during Ripleys two very successful seasons as the Hoyas head coach in 1927-28 and 1928-29. Dudack inherited a team stocked with veterans Ripley had recruited, leading to hopes that Ripleys success would continue under Dudack.\nSenior guard and second-year team captain Fred Mesmer was an important defensive presence for the team during the season and led the Hoyas in scoring for the second straight year, averaging 9.2 points per game. He averaged 8.5 points per game over his collegiate career.\nSenior center Don Dutton scored a career-high 20 points against Johns Hopkins on January 22, 1930, and averaged 8.0 points per game through 16 games before being declared academically ineligible for the rest of the year after mid-term examinations. He focused on his studies and graduated on time in the spring of 1930.\nDespite the teams veteran talent and the winning tradition the school hoped Ripley had established during the previous two years, the 1929-30 Hoyas only managed a 13-12 record. Georgetown did not rehire Dudack for the following season.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

It finished the season with a record of 12-5.\nSeason recap.\nJunior guard and team captain Fred Mesmer had become a starter and team leader in his first varsity season the previous year. He was an important defensive presence for the team during the season and an excellent passer. He led the Hoyas in scoring, averaging 8.5 points per game.\nJunior center Don Dutton, who had emerged as a standout the previous season, moved to forward in a notable 33-17 Georgetown victory at Yale on January 2, 1929, in the opening game of the Yale Quadrangular Invitational Tournament. Ten days later, he played a key role in what at the time was perhaps the greatest comeback in Georgetown men's basketball history, scoring 15 of the Hoyas last 17 points as Georgetown came back from a 13-point deficit against Penn State with five minutes left in the game to win 42-40. Like Mesmer, Dutton finished the year averaging 8.5 points per game.\nIronically, Ripleys display of his coaching abilities in the big win at Yale so impressed Yale that Yale hired Ripley away from Georgetown; after two very successful seasons as the Hoyas head coach in which he had an overall record of 24-6, Ripley left Georgetown at the end of the season to take the head coaching position at Yale. Destined to become a legend in college basketball, he would return to coach Georgetown two more times over a total of eight more seasons, from 1938 to 1943 – leading the Hoyas to the final game of the 1943 NCAA Tournament in the latter season – and again from 1946 to 1949.

It was the second series under the promotion of One Sport Lts. of Poland.\nThe championship was won by Russia's Emil Sayfutdinov, six points ahead of Danish rider Peter Kildemand. Third place went to another Danish rider, Nicki Pedersen, who was another four points behind Kildemand. Pedersen had won the opening two races of the season, before Sayfutdinov moved ahead in the standings after a win at Holsted in Denmark. A fourth-place finish in Częstochowa – an event won by Russian Grigory Laguta – was enough to give Sayfutdinov the title.\nQualification.\nFor the 2014 season, 15 permanent riders were joined at each SEC Final by one wild card and two track reserves.\nDefending champion, Martin Vaculík from Slovakia was automatically invited to participate in all final events. Nicki Pedersen and Grigorij Laguta secured their participation in all final events thanks to being in the top 3 of the general classification in the 2013 season.\nEmil Sayfutdinov, Andreas Jonsson and Tomasz Gollob received and accepted a wild card to compete in the 2014 Speedway European Championships.\nControversy.\nThe European Union Motorcycle (FIM-Europe) introduced a formal ban that prevented riders in the Speedway Grand Prix taking part in the Speedway European Championship. The decision had been rumoured for weeks before being officially confirmed on 3 November 2013. That meant that all riders taking part in the World Championship could not be regular participants of the SEC. Amongst the riders who received permanent wild cards from the SEC were Emil Sayfutdinov, Andreas Jonsson and Tomasz Gollob.\nShortly after this, riders started to show the support to the SEC and their displeasure about the situation. As a result of this, already invited rider Tomasz Gollob, Andreas Jonsson, Nicki Pedersen and Emil Sayfutdinov sent an open letter to the FIM-Europe requesting the solution of the situation.\nA statement from series organisers One Sport Lts. on 17 November 2013 pointed out that the ban was inconsistent with European law and announced an intention to take required legal action. They used the European Union Microsoft competition case as an example.\nOn 29 November, Emil Sayfutdinov announced that he was prepared to drop out of the 2014 SGP series in order to ride in the Speedway European Championship. As a reason, he explained that his Russian sponsors insisted their logos were seen in their country and SEC tournaments were transmitted by a Eurosport channel available in Russia, whereas Grand Prix competitions were not shown by any TV channel in Russia. Moreover, one of SEC tournaments was due to be held in Russia in 2014. On the same day, Tomasz Gollob also announced that he would participate in the Speedway European Championship.\nOn 6 December, Janek Konikiewicz, a representative for One Sport Lts., tweeted that \"It seems that there will be no ban for SGP riders in SEC 2014. Another strong signal, that we have won – but still nothing official\". On 20 December, he also tweeted another message: \"OFFICIAL: One Sport received an official letter from FIM-Europe with information that they advised FIM to not ban any riders from SEC\", which basically ended the story.\nOn 7 February 2014, the FIM board of directors officially took the decision to ban World Championship participants from participating in any kind of European Championships tournament.

John O'Reilly coached it in his eighth season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 6-3.\nSeason recap.\nO'Reilly, who had coached Georgetown for seven seasons from 1914-15 to 1920-21 with an overall record of 65-30 during those years, had missed the last two seasons due to illness. He returned this season for an eighth year coaching the team, which finished with a record of 6-3. O'Reilly would go on to coach another three seasons at Georgetown before retiring after the completion of the 1926-27 season.\nDuring this era, faculty members opposed players missing classes for road games. Furthermore, on-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses and limiting Georgetown to a very limited road schedule between the 1918-19 and 1926-27 seasons – often only to an annual trip to Annapolis, Maryland, to play at Navy and sometimes a single trip to New York or Pennsylvania to play schools there – averaging no more than three road games a year in order to keep travel expenses and missed classes to a minimum. The 1923-24 squad did not even make a New York or Pennsylvania trip; other than a journey across town to play at George Washington, it traveled only to Annapolis to play Navy during the season. One of its scheduled games was cancelled, and it played only nine games.\nGeorgetown defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, culminating in a one-sided 54-8 win at Ryan Gymnasium, Georgetowns 12th straight win there against George Washington dating back to 1915. The wins gave the Hoyas a 19-game winning streak against George Washington, also dating back to 1915 and leading George Washington so suspend the series for 15 years; the two teams would not meet again until 1939.\nA loss to Carson-Newman College on February 2, 1924, finally brought to an end a 52-game home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium for the Hoyas dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916-17 season. The streak had included notable victories over top-rated teams such as Georgia Tech, Kentucky, and North Carolina.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\nSophomore forward Frank \"Hap\" Farley went on to become a powerful New Jersey politician, serving in the New Jersey Assembly from 1937 to 1940 and as a state senator from 1940 to 1971.

Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington this season, giving the Hoyas a 17-game winning streak against George Washington – 11 of them wins at Ryan Gymnasium – dating back to 1915.\nGeorgetown gave starring forward Jack Flavin a fifth season of varsity eligibility this season. He played in 10 games and scored 48 points for a 4.8-point-per-game average for the season.

His 57-game collegiate career ended with him having scored 436 points in his five years of play, averaging 7.6 points per game over his career.\nGuard and team captain Andrew \"Andy\" Zazzali also received a fifth year of varsity eligibility to play this year.

He had scored 370 points and averaged 6.1 points per game in his 61-game collegiate career.\nSenior forward Paul Florence played in nine games and scored 72 points, second-highest on the team, giving him an 8.0 point-per-game average for the season. He had played on the Georgetown football team during the fall of 1922 and got off to a slow start on the basketball team after the conclusion of the football season, but picked up the pace of his scoring as the season wore on and scored a career-high 20 points in his final collegiate game. He left school after the basketball season to play minor-league baseball in the New York Giants organization, having scored 280 points and averaged 8.5 points per game in his 33-game college basketball career.\nFlavin, Florence, and Zazzali as a group played in 44 home games before leaving the school after this season without ever losing one, a significant contribution to the 52-game home winning streak.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "Robert Patrick Herring (born 27 April 1990) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a hooker for United Rugby Championship club Ulster. Born in South Africa, he represents Ireland at international level after qualifying on ancestry grounds.\nClub career.\nBorn in Cape Town, South Africa, Herring hails from one of South Africa's oldest and well known schools, South African College Schools (SACS). He joined London Irish academy in 2009, and made his senior debut for the team in 2010, but was not offered a senior contract, and returned to South Africa to continue his studies. He played for Western Province's under-21 team, and appeared in the Varsity Cup for Stellenbosch University. On the basis of these performances, both Ulster and Connacht showed interest, aware he qualified to play for Ireland through his Irish grandparents. Both teams offered him a two-year development contract, but Herring asked for a six-month trial so he could continue his studies if it didn't work out, and Ulster agreed. He signed for Ulster ahead of the 2012–13 season.\nInitially used as a backup to team captain Rory Best, he got first-team opportunities when Best was on Ireland duty. He was named captain in Best's absence during the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and shared the captaincy with Andrew Trimble during the 2016–17 season after Best stepped down from the role. He made his 100th appearance for the province in September 2016. Since Best's retirement in 2019, Herring has been Ulster's first choice hooker. He made his 200th appearance for Ulster in October 2021. He equalled the Ulster appearance record at 229, alongside Andrew Trimble and Darren Cave, at the end of the 2022–23 season, and became the province's most capped player when he came off the bench against Munster the following season.\nInternational career.\nIn January 2014, Herring was included in the provisional 44 man Ireland squad for the 2014 Six Nations Championship. He made his debut for Ireland in June 2014 coming off the bench in a tour match against Argentina. On 16 October 2019, Herring was called into the Ireland squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup to replace the injured Seán Cronin. He started all five of Ireland's matches in the 2020 Six Nations Championship. He scored a try in the third test against the All Blacks in July 2022, helping Ireland secure a historic series win in New Zealand. He was named in Ireland's 2023 Six Nations Championship squad and went on to score a try in the final match vs. England, as Ireland won the Grand Slam and Triple crown. Herring represented Ireland at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, where he scored two tries in the pool stage against Romania and Tonga."

        "title": "Chris Taylor (baseball)",
        "text": "Christopher Armand Taylor Jr. (born August 29, 1990), nicknamed \"CT3\", is an American professional baseball utility player for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Seattle Mariners. He played college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers. Taylor was selected in the fifth round of the 2012 MLB draft, and made his MLB debut with the Mariners in 2014. Traded to the Dodgers, Taylor won the National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award in 2017, was a member of the World Series champions in 2020, and was an All-Star in 2021.\nEarly life.\nAmateur career.\nTaylor attended Great Neck Middle School in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he was on the wrestling team, and won a city wrestling championship. When he attended Frank W. Cox High School, also in Virginia Beach, he stopped wrestling to focus on baseball. He was named the All-Tidewater region player of the year in 2009.\nTaylor was recruited to play college baseball by the University of Virginia and the College of William &amp; Mary. He chose to attend Virginia, and played college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team, competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In his freshman year, Taylor played sparingly as Tyler Cannon, an All-ACC shortstop, received most of the playing time. In the summer of 2010, he played for the Newport Gulls of the NECBL. In his sophomore year, Stephen Bruno was named the Cavaliers' starting shortstop at the beginning of the season, and Taylor began the year as the team's right fielder. Taylor became the starting shortstop when Bruno suffered a hamstring injury, and retained the job after Bruno recovered. In 2011, he hit a two-out, men on second and third single to score the tying and winning runs in the decisive game of the Charlottesville Super Regional against UC Irvine and send the Cavaliers to the College World Series. In 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Taylor in the fifth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He began his professional career in Minor League Baseball at the Rookie level, but was soon promoted to Class A, primarily playing shortstop. In 2013, Taylor played for the High Desert Mavericks of the Class A-Advanced California League and Jackson Generals of the Class AA Southern League, finishing the season with a combined .314 batting average, 165 hits (eighth-best in Minor League Baseball), eight home runs, 60 runs batted in (RBIs), 108 runs scored, and 38 stolen bases while playing shortstop and second base. After the season, the Mariners assigned Taylor to the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League, and named him their minor league player of the year. He hit .294 with Peoria, and had a .351 on-base percentage, while playing second base and shortstop.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe Mariners invited Taylor to spring training in 2014. Following spring training, he was assigned to the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). He appeared in the Triple-A All-Star Game, and was named the PCL's Top Star. After batting .328 with five home runs, 37 RBIs, and 63 runs scored in 75 games while playing shortstop and second base, the Mariners promoted Taylor to the major leagues on July 24 to replace the injured Willie Bloomquist. He collected his first major-league hit, a single, on the same day against the Baltimore Orioles' Wei-Yin Chen. In 47 games, he hit .287.\nDuring spring training in 2015, Taylor fractured his wrist when he was hit by a pitch. After he recovered from his injury, he began the 2015 season with AAA Tacoma, where he hit .300 in 86 games. For the 2015 major league season, he batted .170 with no home runs and one RBI in 94 at bats, while playing shortstop, second base, and third base.\nAfter beginning 2016 back in the minors, he was recalled on May 21 to replace the injured Ketel Marte. He had one hit in three at-bats over two games.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn June 19, 2016, the Mariners traded Taylor to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Zach Lee. Seattle Mariners General Manager Jerry Dipoto would later regret making this trade by calling it \"clearly the worst deal I've ever made.\"\nOn July 15, 2016, Taylor hit his first major league career home run, a grand slam, off Silvino Bracho of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He also had a double, a triple, drove in six runs, and fell just short of hitting for the cycle. He was the third Dodgers player in history to have his first career homer be a grand slam (Preston Ward in 1948 and Chico Fernández in 1956) and the third Dodgers second baseman to have at least six RBIs in a game (Billy Herman in 1943 and Jackie Robinson in 1949). He played in 34 games for the Dodgers in 2016, hitting .207 with one home run and seven RBIs, primarily playing shortstop.\n2017.\nTaylor did not make the club out of spring training in 2017, and was assigned to Oklahoma City to begin the season, for whom he batted .233 with one home run and five RBIs in 43 at bats. He was recalled to the Dodgers on April 19. On July 6, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Taylor hit his first career walk-off hit, driving in Logan Forsythe to win the game 5-4. For the 2017 season, he batted .288 with 21 home runs and 72 RBIs and 142 strikeouts in 514 at bats, splitting time between center field, left field, second base, shortstop, and third base. \nOn October 14, 2017, Taylor hit his first career postseason home run, off Héctor Rondón of the Chicago Cubs, in Game 1 of the 2017 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Taylor and Justin Turner were selected as the co-MVPs of the NLCS. On October 24, Taylor hit a home run on the first pitch by Astros' pitcher Dallas Keuchel to begin Game 1 of the 2017 World Series. Overall, in the 2017 post-season, Taylor hit .254 with three home runs and seven RBI\nin 15 games as the Dodgers controversially lost the World Series in seven games.\n2018.\nIn his third season with the Dodgers, Taylor posted a .254/.331/.444 slashline with 17 home runs, 63 RBIs and nine stolen bases in 604 plate appearances, and led the National League with 178 strikeouts. He reached career highs in games played (155), runs scored (85), doubles (35), triples (8), and walks (55). With teammate Corey Seager missing most of the season due to injury, Taylor spent the majority of the season at shortstop (81 games, 73 starts). He also played center field (50 games, 32 starts), left field (24 games, 18 starts), second base (12 games, 5 starts), and third base (8 games, 3 starts). On September 10, 2018, Taylor was selected to represent MLB in the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series. In the post-season, Taylor had only one hit in four at-bats in the 2018 NLDS, but his hit was a homer. In the 2018 NLCS, he had eight hits in 22 at-bats and in the 2018 World Series, he had two hits in 18 at-bats.\n2019.\nIn 2019, Taylor returned to his utility role, playing in 124 games (which included 39 at shortstop during another period that Seager was on the injured list). He hit .262/.333/.462 with 12 homers and 52 RBIs, and 115 strikeouts in 366 at bats.\n2020.\nOn February 7, 2020, Taylor signed a two-year, $13.4 million, contract extension with the Dodgers, avoiding salary arbitration. The season was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Taylor was the Dodgers primary second baseman, appearing in 56 of the 60 games the team played, and batting .270/.366/.476 with eight homers and 32 RBIs. In the postseason, he had one hit in eight at-bats in the Wild Card Series, was hitless in 11 at-bats in the NLDS, had three hits in 18 at-bats in the NLCS and in the World Series had five hits, including a home run, in 23 at-bats. Taylor received his first championship ring, as the Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 4–2 to win their first championship since 1988.\n2021.\nTaylor was selected to represent the Dodgers at the All-Star Game, his first All-Star appearance. During the regular season, he batted .254/.344/.438 with 20 home runs, 73 RBIs and 13 stolen bases in 148 games. \nOn October 6, 2021, Taylor hit a two-out, two-run, walk-off home run against the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Wild Card game. On October 21, 2021, Taylor hit three home runs in Game 5 of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves, becoming the first player in MLB history to hit three home runs in an elimination game.\nOn December 1, Taylor re-signed with the Dodgers with a four-year contract worth $60 million, which also contained a team option for a fifth year.\n2022.\nIn 2022, Taylor played in 118 games for he Dodgers (with the majority of them being in the outfield), and batted .221 with 10 homers and 43 RBIs.\n2023.\nOn June 15, Taylor hit his 100th career home run, a grand slam off of Reynaldo López of the Chicago White Sox, becoming the first player in history to hit grand slams for both his first and 100th homers. He played in 117 games, batting .237 with 15 homers and 56 RBI.\nPersonal life.\nTaylor's father, Chris Sr., and grandfather, Armand, attended Virginia Tech, where they competed on the wrestling team.\nTaylor married Mary Keller in December 2022 in Waialua, Hawaii."

The nation was represented by two cross-country skiers.\nCross-country skiing.\nIn November 2012, the International Olympic Committee asked Dominica if it had athletes to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics. In response, Angelica and Gary di Silvestri created the Dominica Ski Federation and qualified for the games. Angelica was born and raised in Italy and Gary was from the United States. Neither had cross-country skied before the age of 30.\nNeither skier completed their event in Sochi. Angelica did not start her race after an injury during training. Had Angelica competed in her race, she would have become the oldest woman to compete in a cross-country skiing race at the Winter Olympics, surpassing Norway's Hilde Gjermundshaug Pedersen, who competed as a 41-year-old at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Gary did not finish due to illness.\nThe appearance of the di Silvestris received criticism from several journalists; neither athlete had any familial ties to Dominica or had ever resided there, and they had only visited the island on a single occasion. They received Dominican citizenship from an investment program and qualified for the Games by competing in low-level races where they finished among the last-place skiers, but earned some qualifying points simply by virtue of being finishers. Several stories cited the team as examples for the need to close loopholes in both acquisition of citizenship and in maintaining competitive qualifying standards for the Games."

As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 6, 2015. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio were elected to the Hall of Fame. It was the first time since that the BBWAA elected four players in one year.\nThe Golden Era Committee, one of three voting panels by era that replaced the more broadly defined Veterans Committee following an earlier rules change in July 2010, convened at Major League Baseball's winter meetings in San Diego on December 8, 2014, to select from a ballot of 10 retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport between 1947 and 1972. None of these candidates received enough votes to be elected.\nThe Hall of Fame induction ceremonies were held on July 26 at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, with new commissioner Rob Manfred presiding for the first time. On the day before the actual induction ceremony, the annual Hall of Fame Awards Presentation took place. At that event, two awards for media excellence were presented – the Hall's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers. The other major Hall of Fame award, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, was not scheduled to be presented again until 2017. Among the other portions of the ceremonies was a presentation by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus honoring the service of baseball personnel in World War II; he also announced the naming of the littoral combat ship USS \"Cooperstown\".\nBBWAA election.\nOn July 26, 2014, the Hall of Fame announced revisions to the rules for recently retired players, decreasing the number of years a player can be on the ballot from 15 to 10. Three candidates presently on the BBWAA ballot (Lee Smith, Don Mattingly and Alan Trammell) in years 10-15 were grandfathered into this system and retained their previous 15 years of eligibility. In addition, BBWAA members who were otherwise eligible to cast ballots were required to complete a registration form and sign a code of conduct before receiving their ballots, and the Hall made public the names of all members who cast ballots (but not their individual votes) when it announced the election results. The code of conduct specifically states that the ballot is non-transferable, a direct reaction to Dan Le Batard's actions in the 2014 balloting process. Violation of the code of conduct will result in a lifetime ban from BBWAA voting.\nThe ballot included two categories of players:\nThere were 549 total ballots cast and 4623 individual votes for players, for an average of 8.4 players named per ballot.\nAll BBWAA members with at least 10 years of continuous membership were eligible to vote. One member of the 2014 electorate, Dan Le Batard, was suspended from the BBWAA for a year (which automatically made him ineligible to cast a vote in this election) and also banned for life from voting in any future Hall of Fame election after he revealed that he had turned over his 2014 ballot to Deadspin and allowed the website's readers to make selections.\nAs in most recent elections, the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) dominated the election. \"ESPN.com\" columnist Jim Caple noted in the days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections:\nCaple's predictions about the players on the 2015 ballot, as well as the players he expected to be elected before then, mostly proved accurate. Larkin was indeed elected in 2012, and Maddux, Glavine and Thomas were elected on their first ballot appearance in 2014. The main exceptions were Palmeiro and Williams, who got less than 5% of the vote in prior elections and failed to stay on, and Biggio, who fell short of election in both of his first two years on the ballot, missing out in 2014 by two votes.\nAnother \"ESPN.com\" writer, Tim Kurkjian, noted that the 2013 ballot would include several new candidates who either tested positive or were strongly linked to PEDs:\nDon Mattingly was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Marlon Anderson, Paul Bako, Michael Barrett, Chad Bradford, Doug Brocail, Emil Brown, Paul Byrd, Raul Chavez, Joe Crede, David Dellucci, Adam Eaton, Alan Embree, Kelvim Escobar, Chad Fox, Tony Graffanino, Matt Herges, Braden Looper, Mark Loretta, Ramón Martínez, Doug Mientkiewicz, Kevin Millar, Eric Milton, Greg Norton, Tomo Ohka, Sidney Ponson, Glendon Rusch, B.J. Ryan, Brian Shouse, Justin Speier, Julián Tavárez, Ron Villone, Luis Vizcaino, Jamie Walker, Jarrod Washburn and David Weathers.\nGolden Era Committee.\nIn keeping with the current Hall of Fame voting procedure, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified 10 Golden Era candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions between 1947 and 1972. Along with the 1947–1972 era, these rules defined the consideration set:\nThe eleven Historical Overview Committee members (the same members who served in 2011) were: Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"), Bob Elliot (\"Toronto Sun\"), Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\"), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"), Ken Nigro (formerly \"Baltimore Sun\"), Jack O'Connell (BBWAA Secretary/Treasurer), Tracy Ringolsby (MLB.com), Glen Schwartz (formerly \"San Francisco Chronicle\"), Claire Smith (ESPN) and Mark Whicker (Los Angeles News Group). The names of the committee members were released by the Hall of Fame on November 4, 2014.\nThe ballot for election by the Golden Era Committee was released on October 30, 2014; the committee voted at the MLB winter meetings in San Diego on December 8, 2014, with the results announced by MLB immediately thereafter. The cutoff for election and summer 2015 induction remained the standard 75%, or 12 of 16 votes. None of the candidates received enough votes, continuing a long period of difficulty in electing players eligible under the Hall's special committees; the last living player elected to the Hall after the expiration of his BBWAA eligibility was Bill Mazeroski in 2001.\nThis election marked the second time this era had been considered; Ron Santo was elected by the committee and inducted in 2012. In addition, Joe Torre – another popular candidate from this period – was inducted as a manager in 2014. Four of the candidates – Allen, Howsam, Pierce, and Wills – were considered for the first time. Among the holdovers from the 2011 Golden Era balloting were four who received at least half of the committee votes: Kaat (10), Hodges (9), Miñoso (9), and Oliva (8). Seven of the candidates were living when the ballot was announced, the exceptions being Hodges, Boyer, and Howsam (who respectively died in 1972, 1982 and 2008).\nThe Golden Era Committee's 16-member voting electorate, appointed by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, was announced at the same time as the ballot of 10 candidates. The Baseball Hall of Fame officially named this group the \"Golden Era Committee\" (\"The Committee\"), which voted for the first time on December 5, 2011. All of the Hall of Fame members on this committee were inducted as players, except for executive Pat Gillick.\nIn July 2016, the Hall announced a major change to its era-based committee system, replacing the then-existing three voting bodies with four new panels. The change will have a significant effect on future elections of individuals who had been considered by the Golden Era Committee. In the new system, the closest equivalent to the Golden Era Committee is the new Golden Days Committee, which will consider figures whose greatest contributions occurred between 1950 and 1969. Also, this new voting body will only meet once every five years, specifically in years ending in 0 and 5 as part of the election process for the next year's induction ceremony.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three nominees for the 2015 award, selected by a BBWAA committee, were announced at the BBWAA's annual All-Star Game meeting on July 15, 2014. They were the late Furman Bisher, longtime columnist for the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\"; Tom Gage, beat writer for \"The Detroit News\"; and Dan Shaughnessy, columnist for \"The Boston Globe\". Under BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2014 World Series or at the 2014 winter meetings; in recent years, the announcement has been made at the winter meetings.\nOn December 9, Tom Gage was named as the recipient. Of the record 463 ballots cast (including one blank), Gage received 167 to Bisher's 161, with Shaughnessy receiving 134. The vote was the closest since balloting by mail began in 2002, both by the margin between the top two candidates and the gap between the three finalists. At the time of announcement, Gage was covering the Detroit Tigers for \"The Detroit News\", a position he had held since leaving his original home of \"The Times-Picayune\" of New Orleans in 1978. He had twice been Michigan's sportswriter of the year, and had also not missed a day while on the Tigers beat – including covering a night game after undergoing a root canal procedure that morning. He is also a past member of the Hall of Fame ballot screening committee.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. The 2015 recipient was announced during the 2014 winter meetings, following a vote by a 20-member committee composed of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists.\nThis was the second Frick Award selection under a process similar to that instituted for Veterans Committee balloting in 2010. Candidates are now considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions:\nAlso, the committee that selects the final recipient no longer has a role in determining any of the finalists. Before the 2014 selection process, the selection committee also chose seven of the 10 finalists, but that role has now been given to a Hall of Fame research committee.\nTen finalists from the \"Living Room Era\" were announced on October 3, 2014. In accord with the current guidelines, seven were chosen by a Hall of Fame research committee, while the other three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's Facebook page from September 8 to September 30.\nAt the time of the announcement of the finalists, only Cárdenas and Enberg were still living, and only Enberg was still active. The broadcasting careers of the finalists covered a span of nearly 75 years, starting with the beginning of Dean's broadcasting career immediately after his retirement as a player in 1941. In addition to the still-active Enberg, three other finalists (Berroa, Kiner, and Nuxhall) were active in the 21st century. Three of the finalists (Ashburn, Dean, and Kiner) are Hall of Fame members as players.\nOn December 10, 2014, Enberg was named as the recipient. He began his MLB broadcasting career in 1968 as the play-by-play announcer for the California Angels, continuing in that role through 1978. Enberg joined NBC Sports in 1975, covering baseball plus many other sports for the next quarter-century. He then moved to CBS Sports in 2000; after leaving that network in 2010, he became the play-by-play announcer for the San Diego Padres, a position he still held when he was announced as the recipient."

        "text": "The 1985–86 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1985–86 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 14th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 24–8, 11–5 in Big East play. They advanced to the 1986 Big East men's basketball tournament semifinals before losing to Syracuse and to the second round of the 1986 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament before losing to Michigan State. They were ranked No. 13 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 15 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nBy the mid-1980s, slow-down games in which weaker teams attempted to control the ball for long stretches without shooting as a way of evening their odds against larger and faster teams had become common enough in mens college basketball to prompt the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to adopt a shot clock in men basketball this season to force a return to quicker and higher-scoring play. Initially a 45-second clock, it would be reduced to 35 seconds in the 1993-94 season.\nThe new shot clock was not the only major change that the 1985-86 Hoyas faced: They also played the first season of the post-Patrick Ewing era at Georgetown, and the graduation of the dominant center – as well as of forward Bill Martin – in May 1985 required adjustments by a team that had become accustomed to Ewings stellar offensive and defensive performances.\nJunior forward Reggie Williams and senior forward David Wingate were the teams top scoring threats, combining to lead the Hoyas in scoring in 28 of the seasons 32 games. Williams scored in double figures in 31 games, including 30 points against 18th-ranked DePaul, 25 points against 10th-ranked St. John's, 22 points and 14 rebounds in Georgetowns first meeting with Villanova, and 26 points and 12 rebounds in the second game against Villanova. He shot 53% from the field and led his team with 17.6 points per game. Wingate, who had played much of his first two seasons at guard but moved to small forward this year, played nearly 1,000 minutes without ever fouling out, and tied his career high with 26 points against Pittsburgh in the last home game of his Georgetown career. He finished the year second to Williams in scoring, averaging 15.9 points per game.\nSenior guard Horace Broadnax had seen limited playing time as a reserve and scored in double figures in a combined 18 games during the previous three seasons, but Wingates move to forward this season allowed him to become a starter for the first time. As such, he had his best season as a Hoya, with 13 points in 17 minutes against Providence, 16 points against seventh-ranked Louisiana State, 15 points against Connecticut, and 17 points against Boston College. Although he averaged only 20 minutes per game, he was fourth in both scoring and assists for the season, and averaged 7.5 points per game.\nSenior guard and team co-captain Michael Jackson provided leadership to the team all season. During the final ten games of the regular season, he averaged 11 points and 6.4 assists a game and shot a perfect 30-for-30 from the free-throw line as Georgetown won seven of the games and lost the other three by a combined total of only five points. Overall, he shot 50% from the field and 81% from the free-throw line during the season and had 200 assists. He finished his collegiate career as the leader in Georgetown history in assists, with 671.\nFreshman guard Charles Smith joined the team this season. He had a season-high 11 points against Seton Hall, but saw limited playing time, averaging eight minutes and 3.0 points per game. He would emerge late the following season as one of Georgetowns top players. Freshman forward Jaren Jackson was another newcomer. Limited to reserve duty, he came off the bench to lead the team in scoring in three games, but scored half his 102 points for the season in those three games, averaging only 3.2 points per game for the year. His breakout season would come in his junior year.\nSophomore guard Perry McDonald was hobbled by a back injury all season and averaged only 3.4 points per game. Like Smith, he would begin to make his mark as one of the Hoya greats the following year.\nThe Hoyas record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1986 Big East men's basketball tournament. In the quarterfinals, they squeaked past Pittsburgh with a one-point win in which Wingates defense was key to pulling out the victory. They thus advanced to the tournament semifinals, where they lost to Syracuse.\nGeorgetown was the No. 4 seed in the Midwest Region of the 1986 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the eighth of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and defeated Texas Tech in the first round to advance to the second round, in which the Hoyas met the Midwest Regions No. 5 seed, Michigan State. Although he had nine of Georgetowns 17 assists, Michael Jackson shot only 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field while Michigan State senior guard Scott Skiles scored 24 points to lead the Spartans to an 80–68 upset win and bring the Hoyas season to an end.\nDavid Wingate graduated in May 1986 as the third-highest scorer in Georgetown history, having been the runner-up in scoring in each of his four seasons on the team. During his four years, Georgetown had posted a record of 115-24 (.827), and during the final three years of his collegiate career the Hoyas had lost a combined total of only four home games.\nThe 1985-86 Hoyas were ranked No. 13 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 15 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1985–86 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

Nine of the team, and several other players who represented Sukkur in the 1970s, had played for the neighbouring Khairpur team before it lost its first-class status after the 1973–74 season.\nThey played three games in 1975–76, losing them all but less overwhelmingly than in their debut match. In the match against Hyderabad they took a first-innings lead, but lost by seven wickets. Sharif Kaka made 92 and 45 and took 6 for 52 in the first innings, which remained Sukkur's best-ever bowling figures.\nSukkur's only victory came in the first game of the 1976–77 season, in the short-lived Sikander Ali Bhutto Cup, when they beat Hyderabad at Gama Stadium, Mirpur Khas, by seven wickets. Aslam Jafri made 104 and 49, top-scoring in each innings in a low-scoring match. Ashiq Hussain took 3 for 38 and 5 for 38.

        "title": "Matthew Knight (basketball)",
        "text": "Matthew James Knight (born 31 May 1985) is an Australian former professional basketball player. He played four years of college basketball in the United States for the Loyola Marymount Lions before debuting in the National Basketball League (NBL) in 2007. After two seasons with the West Sydney Razorbacks / Sydney Spirit, he had a season in Hungary before playing eight seasons with the Perth Wildcats and winning three NBL championships. Knight endured a long list of injuries during his tenure with the Wildcats, having struggled with calf, shoulder, ankle and toe complaints, as well as suffering a number of concussion-related incidents. Three head knocks in 2017 led to Knight announcing his retirement from the NBL midway through the 2017–18 season.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Burnie, Tasmania, Knight played both basketball and Australian rules football as a junior. He was a talented footballer growing up, following in the steps of his father, Scott, who played five games for Collingwood in the VFL in 1984 before carving out an accomplished career in Tasmania. Knight went to watch his father play every Saturday, and during the week, he'd go with him to training. He played football right up until the end of secondary school. At that stage, he had to make a decision, and he'd heard there was more opportunity to go overseas with basketball, so he chose to commit to basketball. He also wanted to get away from the shadow of his father.\nKnight attended Smithton High School in 1997 and 1998 before linking up with the Tasmanian Institute of Sport (TIS) and joining the TIS Basketball Elite Development Squad. He played for the Tasmania under-16 team in 1999 and 2000, the under-18 team in 2001 and 2002, and the under-20 team in 2003.\nIn 2002, Knight played in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) for the North-West Tasmania Brewers and earned SEABL South Australian Youth Player of the Year honours. He moved to Canberra to attend the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 2003 and played for AIS men's basketball team in the SEABL. He subsequently went on to play for the Australian junior national team at the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he won a gold medal.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nOn 10 June 2003, Knight and future Perth Wildcats teammate Damian Martin signed National Letters of Intent to join the Loyola Marymount University men's basketball program.\nKnight was slowed by ankle surgery following the 2003 FIBA World Championship and subsequently missed the first six games of the 2003–04 season. He played 18 games for the Lions as a freshman, with his 3.5-rebounds-per-game average ranking 11th all-time among freshmen at LMU. He also averaged 4.9 points per game.\nSophomore year.\nAs a sophomore in 2004–05, Knight proved to be the go-to-guy for the Lions all season, and for his efforts, he earned All-West Coast Conference honorable mention honours. He finished the regular season averaging a team-best 15.4 points and 5.9 rebounds per game while starting all 28 games. He led the team in minutes played (28.9 per game), and led the team in scoring in 18 contests. His 10.5-point turn around on the season was the best in the WCC as he scored in double figures in all but four games. He ranked sixth in the league in shooting percentage (51.2) and was second in the league in offensive rebounds (2.82). On 18 December 2004, Knight exploded for the Lions in win over San Diego State to become the first Lion to score 30 points in a regular season game since January 1998. Knight finished with 30 points on 13-of-21 shooting, going 4-of-4 from the free throw line while adding a then career-high nine rebounds.\nJunior year.\nAs a junior in 2005–06, Knight was a Player of the Year candidate in the West Coast Conference and earned first-team All-WCC honours. He ranked seventh in the WCC at 16.2 points per game and led the WCC in rebounds at 10.0 per game. During the season, he became just the 11th player in LMU history to record 1,000 career points and 500 career rebounds. He scored in double figures in every WCC game and had a career-best 32 points and 18 rebounds against Long Beach State on 30 November 2006.\nSenior year.\nPrior to the 2006–07 season, the Lions were picked by many to challenge for the WCC title, but their season was filled with near misses (losing to Long Beach State on a half court shot at the buzzer and three other WCC games on shots at the buzzer), critical injuries (Brandon Worthy out with ACL), uphill battles (starting 1–6 in the WCC) and bad luck (drawing host team in first round) that proved too much for the sixth-seeded Lions as they finish 13–18 on the year. Their season ended with a loss to the University of Portland at the Chiles Center in the first round of the West Coast Conference Championships. In his final game for LMU, Knight recorded 15 points and seven rebounds. He finished his career with 1,466 points and 743 rebounds, ranking 10th and sixth, respectively. He became the fifth player in LMU history to rank in the top-10 in career points and rebounds. Over 28 games as a senior in 2006–07, Knight averaged 16.5 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. He subsequently earned first-team All-WCC honours for the second straight year.\nKnight's four-year career at LMU was defined by the double-double. He earned his 25th double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds against Santa Clara on 27 January 2007. Overall, he had two as a sophomore in 2004–05, broke out for 17 in 2005–06, and then six as a senior for 25 total, replacing Ime Oduok for fifth all-time in LMU history. His 17 as a junior was the most since Hank Gathers had 26 in the 1988–89 season and ranked him seventh all-time for single season double-doubles.\nProfessional career.\nWest Sydney Razorbacks / Sydney Spirit (2007–2009).\nAfter attending an NBA work-out with the Los Angeles Clippers, Knight joined the West Sydney Razorbacks of the National Basketball League (NBL) for the 2007–08 season. In his rookie season, Knight appeared in 25 of the team's 30 games and averaged 12.0 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. He also recorded six double-doubles. The Razorbacks finished the regular season in tenth place with a 10–20 record.\nFor the 2008–09 season, the Razorbacks were renamed the Sydney Spirit in a bid to broaden their supporter base after the collapse of the Sydney Kings. Knight continued on with the Spirit, but financial difficulties soon besieged the club mid-season. After team owner Greg Evans was served a default notice, all players were asked to take a 50 per cent pay cut. This led to the league having to step in and provide assistance in order for the club to play out the season. The Spirit missed the playoffs while Knight finished with averages of 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. He was subsequently named NBL Most Improved Player and was named in the All-NBL Third Team. He also finished second in MVP voting.\nHungary (2009–2010).\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2008–09 NBL season, Knight joined Hungarian club Kecskeméti KSE. In six games across March and April, Knight averaged 16.2 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.7 steals per game.\nIn August 2009, Knight signed a one-year deal with Soproni KC, returning to Hungary for a second stint. In March 2010, he was named an International All-Star and played in the league's all-star game against the national team of Hungary. He went on to lead Soproni to a playoff berth, but they were knocked out in the first round by Körmend, losing the series 3–0. In 27 games (24 regular season, three playoff) for the club in 2009–10, Knight averaged 15.9 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game.\nPerth Wildcats (2010–2017).\nOn 7 April 2010, Knight signed a three-year deal with the Perth Wildcats, returning to the NBL after one season in Hungary. He was lured to the club by his Sydney Spirit comrades, Damian Martin and Rob Beveridge, with the pair coming off an NBL championship with the Wildcats in 2009–10.\nUpon moving to Perth, Knight joined the Rockingham Flames of the State Basketball League (SBL) and had a three-game stint with the club in mid-July.\n2010–11 season.\nKnight's debut season for the Wildcats began positively before a left calf injury suffered on 12 December 2010 against the Melbourne Tigers ruled him out for two months. Further injuries to Jesse Wagstaff and Shawn Redhage threw the Wildcats' season into disarray as they stumbled through the regular season with inadequate injury replacements. Knight returned to action on 11 February 2011 and helped the team reach the playoffs with a fourth-place finish and a 16–12 record. In their semi-final series against the first-seeded New Zealand Breakers, the Wildcats took Game 1 in Auckland, but then lost Games 2 and 3 to bow out of the playoffs with a 2–1 defeat. In 18 games for the Wildcats in 2010–11, Knight averaged 12.4 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game.\nFollowing the 2010–11 NBL season, Knight returned to the SBL and joined the Willetton Tigers. He was a dominant force for the Tigers over his first seven games, but in his eighth appearance for the club on 17 June, he suffered a slight calf strain to the same calf he tore on 12 December 2010. The strain ruled him out for a month of action, as he returned to the line-up on 16 July for a four-minute stint. In nine games for the Tigers in 2011, Knight averaged 18.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals per game.\n2011–12 season.\nKnight was relatively injury free in 2011–12 and was able to lead the Wildcats to a second-place finish with a 19–9 record. After defeating the Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats moved on to the Grand Final series where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. They lost Game 1 in Auckland but were able to tie the series at 1–1 with a Game 2 victory in Perth, leaving the series to a Game 3 decider in Auckland. In a tightly fought game, the Wildcats went down to the Breakers 79–73, finishing runners-up with a 2–1 defeat. In 29 games for the Wildcats in 2011–12, Knight averaged 10.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game.\n2012–13 season: All-NBL First Team.\nAfter undergoing off-season shoulder surgery, Knight entered the 2012–13 season with the mindset of wanting to be the dominant big guy in the NBL and was set to be the team's go-to guy in the paint. Knight embraced the responsibility that came with being the team's primary focus under the basket, and excelled in the Wildcats' season-opening win over the New Zealand Breakers, earning the NBL's Player of the Week award for a 20-point, nine-rebound effort. He went on to lead the Wildcats to a 22–6 record, good for second behind their arch rivals the Breakers, who amassed just three losses on the season. After sweeping the Wollongong Hawks in the semi-finals, the Wildcats returned to the Grand Final series where they again faced the Breakers – their third time facing the Breakers in a playoff series in as many years. However, with the team missing Damian Martin through injury, the Wildcats stumbled to a 2–0 defeat, as the Breakers claimed their third championship in a row, winning Game 2 in Perth at Perth Arena. Despite another disappointing end to a good overall season, Knight picked up numerous accolades for the 2012–13 season, including finishing runner-up for the Wildcats MVP, being named in the All-NBL first team and voted as the starting centre in the All-Star game, reaffirming his status as the league's premier big man. In 27 games for the Wildcats in 2012–13, he averaged 13.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.\n2013–14 season: First Championship.\nOn 5 May 2013, Knight re-signed with the Wildcats on a three-year deal. He missed much of the 2013–14 NBL season through injury. The Wildcats returned to the Grand Final in 2014 and defeated the Adelaide 36ers 2–1 to win the NBL championship as Knight claimed his first title. In 18 games for the Wildcats in 2013–14, he averaged 10.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game.\n2014–15 season.\nOn 16 November 2014, Knight played his 100th game for the Wildcats in an 85–66 win over the Sydney Kings. In 30 minutes of action, he recorded 16 points and eight rebounds. On 9 January 2015, he was ruled out for six weeks with a toe injury. After missing six games, he returned to action earlier than expected, suiting up on 1 February against Sydney. The 2014–15 season turned out to be a near carbon copy of the 2010–11 season for the Wildcats as they finished fourth on the ladder with a 16–12 record and were knocked out in the semi-finals by the Cairns Taipans, failing to defend their 2013–14 title in a season that was plagued with injuries. In 24 games for the Wildcats in 2014–15, Knight averaged 10.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. He subsequently earned All-NBL second team honours.\n2015–16 season: Second Championship.\nFor the first time in his Wildcats career, Knight had an injury-free season in 2015–16. With the team's acquisition of Nathan Jawai, Knight was able to move to his natural position of power forward. The Wildcats returned to the grand final and beat the New Zealand Breakers 2–1 to win the championship. Knight appeared in 33 of the team's 34 games in 2015–16, averaging 11.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. He earned All-NBL second team honours for the second straight year.\n2016–17 season: Third Championship.\nOn 19 April 2016, Knight re-signed with the Wildcats on a two-year deal, a month after undergoing shoulder stabilisation surgery on his left arm. Unfortunately, injury struck down Knight again during the 2016 off-season. On 12 September 2016, he was ruled out for two months after suffering a subluxation of his right shoulder during training a week earlier. However, the joint responded well to rehab and after a week of full training with the team, Wildcats medical staff gave him the all-clear on 20 October 2016. He made his season debut the following day, recording 12 points and eight rebounds in an 80–73 win over the Illawarra Hawks. On 13 November, he had a season-best game with 24 points and 13 rebounds in an 87–86 overtime loss to the New Zealand Breakers. After averaging 13 points per game over his first eight games, Knight's form began to decline in December as he scored in double figures just three times over the next 14 games. He also had only one double-digit rebounding game during that stretch. In the Wildcats' regular season finale on 12 February 2017, Knight had his best game since late November with a double-double of 15 points and 10 rebounds to help lead the Wildcats to a 96–94 win over Melbourne United in Melbourne. The win propelled the Wildcats into their 31st consecutive NBL Finals appearance, as they finished the regular season in third place with a 15–13 record. Knight helped the Wildcats win through to another NBL Grand Final after sweeping the second-seeded Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals. In Game 1 of the best-of-five grand final series, Knight scored 18 points to help lift the Wildcats to an 89–77 win over the Illawarra Hawks. In Game 2 of the series, Knight had to be helped off the court after seemingly innocuous contact from teammate Casey Prather early in the third quarter. He was subsequently ruled out of Game 3. Despite being without Knight, the Wildcats successfully defended their title with a 3–0 series sweep. It marked the Wildcats' eighth championship and Knight's third. Knight appeared in 27 of the team's 33 games, averaging 9.4 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.\nKnight sustained two head knocks over the last month of the 2016–17 NBL season, both of which resulted in him being unable to complete the game and missing a subsequent contest. Wildcats managing director Nick Marvin acknowledged that the club would consult with Knight during the 2017 off-season, with six concussion-related incidents in six years raising concerns over his long-term health.\n2017–18 season: Retirement brought forward.\nOn 1 July 2017, Knight revealed that the 2017–18 NBL season would be his last. After battling shoulder problems and concussion in 2016–17, Knight had hoped to avoid more injuries in his final season. However, on 13 September 2017, he was ruled out for the remainder of the club's pre-season games with a thumb injury. The injury occurred in the Wildcats' opening game of the NBL Blitz. Scans revealed a small fracture and ligament damage in his right thumb, with Wildcats medical staff opting to take a non-surgical approach to repairing the injury. The injury-prone Knight suffered head knocks against Brisbane and Cairns early in the season, but concerns for his future were only fully taken into account following another head knock that came accidentally at training on 30 October. As a result, Knight brought forward his retirement plans, calling time on his 236-game NBL career on 6 November 2017. He finished his career with 2,800 points and 1,646 rebounds.\nPersonal.\nOn 2 December 2013, Knight and his partner Sherelle had their first child, a daughter named Mia Rose. He later married Sherelle in September 2014.\nIn 2013, Knight considered a switch to Australian Rules football in order to follow in his father's footsteps after attracting interest from WAFL club West Perth."

        "text": "The following is a list of VMI Keydets basketball seasons. VMI competes in the Southern Conference of the NCAA's Division I. Since 1981, the Keydets have played their home games out of 5,800–seat Cameron Hall.\nThe history of VMI basketball dates back to 1908, with the formation of the school's first team. The Keydets played as an independent until 1918, when they joined the now-defunct South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Following the league's demise, VMI returned to playing as an independent before joining the Southern Conference in 1924, where they would remain for the next eighty years. VMI left the SoCon for the Big South Conference in 2003, but returned to the league in 2014.\nVMI has won three conference championships in their history, all of them while in the Southern Conference. The first came in 1964 under head coach Weenie Miller, a season in which the Keydets upset Lefty Driesell and his top-ranked Davidson Wildcats in the SoCon Tournament. Later in 1976, VMI, led by Hall of Fame forward Ron Carter, achieved a 22–10 record en route to a conference championship and upset run to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament. The Keydets advanced to the Sweet 16 the following year in 1977, and have not been to the NCAA tournament since. In 2014, however, VMI accepted an invitation to participate in the 2014 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, where they advanced to the semifinals before falling to Yale.\nAs of the end of the 2017–18 season, VMI has achieved an 894–1,515 all-time record since its inception in 1908.\nPostseason playoff results.\nThe Keydets have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments, all by way of winning their conference tournament and the subsequent automatic bid. VMI made two upset tournament runs in 1976 and 1977 which culminated in Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen appearances, respectively. After a 37-year postseason drought, VMI accepted an invitation to participate in the 2014 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. A field of 32 teams, the Keydets won three games and lost in the semifinal round of the tournament.\nStatistics.\n\"Statistics correct as of the end of the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season\""

        "text": "Matthew Johnson (born circa 1969) is an American basketball coach and former player best known for his collegiate playing career at the University of Vermont from 1987 to 1991. His professional basketball career was a one-year stint in Ireland in 1994–95. He served as the head boys' basketball coach at Burlington High School in Burlington, Vermont from 2002–2016, winning four Vermont Division I boys' basketball championships, and an overall record of 265–61. He was named head boys' basketball coach at Jefferson County High School in Dandridge, Tennessee in 2017.\nHigh school career.\nMatt Johnson attended Bellows Free Academy, St. Albans in St. Albans, Vermont. In his four-year prep career he scored 2,121 points, which as of January 2010 is the second-highest total in state history behind Bruce Dalrymple's 2,477. The three-point field goal line was instituted his senior season. At the end of the year he was named the 1987 Vermont High School Athlete of the Year. Despite this, Johnson was lightly recruited by colleges.\nCollege career.\nOne college that did pursue Johnson was his home state's University of Vermont, an NCAA Division I school who was a member of the North Atlantic Conference (now known as the America East Conference). He accepted an athletic scholarship to play for the Catamounts. In his freshman season he averaged a modest 4.5 points per game in limited action. Johnson began progressing during his sophomore season in 1988–89 and averaged over 16 points per game in his final six games of that season. It was in his junior season that he began to make a name for himself. Johnson averaged 14.3 points per game, good for seventh in the conference, and he came through in crunch time during the North Atlantic Conference tournament. He was named to the All-NAC Tournament Team, although Vermont lost in their first-ever championship match. In 1990–91, Johnson's senior season at Vermont, he averaged a conference-best 20.7 points per game, scored a then-school single season record 580 points, and tallied 40 or more points three different times. In the North Atlantic Conference's 22-year existence at that point, he became the first player to be named the NAC Player of the Week four straight weeks. Johnson led the Catamounts to their first winning season in 10 years and was named not only a first team all-conference performer, but also became Vermont's first North Atlantic Conference Player of the Year. At the time of his graduation his 1,264 points ranked 10th in school history.\nPost-college.\nAfter graduating in 1991, Johnson spent the 1992–93 year as Proctor High School's head boys' basketball coach and was named the Marble Valley League Coach of the Year. He then spent the 1993–94 year as an assistant coach for his collegiate \"alma mater\" before spending one season playing professional basketball in Ireland for Queen's Strongbow. Upon returning home to the United States, Johnson earned a Master's in Public Administration at San Diego State University in 1997, then moved back to Vermont. From 1997 to 1999 he was an assistant coach at Peoples Academy in Morrisville, Vermont. In 2002, Johnson became the head boys' basketball coach at Burlington High School, where he coached until 2016, winning four state titles with an overall record of 265–61 with the Seahorses. Johnson also worked as a teacher and counselor at a juvenile correctional facility. He and his wife, Sarah, have two daughters, Haley and Madison and one son, Nick. Johnson was inducted into the University of Vermont Hall of Fame in 2001."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1921–22 NCAA college basketball season. With John O'Reilly unable to coach due to illness, James Colliflower – a 1906 Georgetown graduate who played for Georgetown while at law school and then had coached the team for three seasons from 1911 to 1914 – returned to coach the team for one more season without pay. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 11–3.\nSeason recap.\nOn-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914–15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses and generally limiting Georgetown to an annual trip to Annapolis, Maryland, to play at Navy and trips to New York to play schools there, averaging no more than three road games a year from the 1918-19 season to the 1926-27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum. The 1921–22 team did not even visit Navy, but did make a trip to New York and New Jersey for three games at the end of the season. Otherwise, its only road game was a trip across town to play at George Washington.\nThe Hoyas home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 44 games at the end of this season, dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916–17 season; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923–24 season. A highlight of the home season at Ryan was a major upset when Georgetown defeated highly rated Kentucky, which had won the first Southern Conference championship the previous season. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, giving the Hoyas a 16-game winning streak against George Washington – 11 of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium – dating back to 1915.\nSenior forward Jack Flavin was the teams second-highest scorer. An excellent shooter, he played in 13 games and scored 93 points for a 7.2-point-per-game average for the season.\nSenior guard Andrew \"Andy\" Zazzali saw reduced playing time this season because of injuries and because Georgetown chose to put younger players on the court. He nonetheless played in 13 games, scoring 38 points for the season and averaging 2.9 points per game. He made a running jump shot late in the Kentucky game that helped in the upset of the Wildcats, and that helped him win back a starting role in the later part of the season.\nIn this era, each team was allowed to designate a single player to shoot all of its free throws, and junior forward Paul Florence was that player this season for Georgetown. He scored 18 points in the season opener against St. Joseph's and led the team in scoring for the year, appearing in 12 games, scoring 136 points, and averaging 11.3 points per game for the season. He played a key defensive role in the upset of Kentucky.\nThe team began the season with an 11-game winning streak, but lost all three games of its season-ending road trip to finish at 11–3.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933–34 season.\n1921–22 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so the February 20, 1922, game against the Crescent Athletic Club counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1921–22. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951–52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

He played an excellent defense during the season; over a stretch of five games that included games against nationally renowned St. John's, North Carolina, and Georgia Tech, his defense played a major role in holding opponents to an average of less than six points in the first half.\nSophomore forward Paul Florence was the only new player on the team, which had finished with a 13-1 record the previous season.

        "title": "1968 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1968 AFL Championship Game was the ninth annual title game of the American Football League, played on December 29 at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York City, New York. In a rematch of the notorious Heidi Game played earlier in the season, the New York Jets (11–3) of the Eastern Division hosted the defending champion Oakland Raiders (12–2) of the Western Division. Although the Raiders had the better record (on account of having prevailed in the aforementioned contest), the Jets were slight favorites. The Raiders had hosted a tiebreaker playoff game the week before against the Kansas City Chiefs (12–2) to determine the Western Division champion, while the Eastern champion Jets won their division outright and thus were idle.\nSlightly favored, the Jets defeated the Raiders 27–23 to win the championship and the chance to play the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.\nGame summary.\nA 28-yard punt by Oakland's Mike Eischeid gave New York the ball on the Raiders 44-yard line on their first possession, and they took advantage of the short field with a 4-play scoring drive. Joe Namath completed two 14-yard passes to Maynard on it, the second one a touchdown to give the Jets an early 7–0 lead. Meanwhile, Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica completed just one of his first 13 pass attempts. His first completion was a 36-yard pass to Billy Cannon, but the Raiders ended up with no points on that drive when George Blanda hit the cross bar attempting a 45-yard field goal. New York then drove to a 33-yard field goal by Jim Turner, giving them a 10–0 lead in the final minutes of the first quarter.\nAfter being completely dominated up to this point, the Raiders offense finally got into gear as Lamonica completed passes to Pete Banaszak and Fred Biletnikoff for gains of 11 and 15 yards. Then he hit fullback Hewritt Dixon for a 23-yard gain on the last play of the first quarter. As the second quarter opened up, Lamonica finished the 80-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Biletnikoff, making the score 10–7. The rest of the quarter would result in nothing but field goal attempts, with Turner missing one from 44 yards, but connecting from 35, while Blanda kicked a 26-yard field goal right before halftime to make the score 13–10.\nLamonica opened the third quarter with a 37-yard completion to Biletnikoff. Then his 40-yard pass to receiver Warren Wells gave Oakland a first down on the Jets 6-yard line. However, rush attempts over the next three plays resulted in just 5 yards. Faced with 4th and goal on the 1, coach John Rauch decided to play conservative and had Blanda kick a 9-yard field goal that tied the game at 13. New York responded by driving 80 yards in 14 plays to retake the lead, 20–13, on Namath's 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pete Lammons with one minute left until the 4th quarter.\nOakland responded to the touchdown with Lamonica's 57-yard completion to Biletnikoff setting up a 20-yard Blanda field goal, cutting the score to 20–16. Then Raiders defensive back George Atkinson intercepted a pass from Namath and returned it 32 yards to the Jets 5-yard line. On the next play, Banaszak ran the ball into the end zone, giving Oakland their first lead of the game at 23–20 with 8:18 remaining on the clock.\nHowever, this turned out to be very short lived. After starting out the ensuing drive with a 10-yard completion to George Sauer Jr., Namath completed a 52-yard pass to Maynard at the Raiders 6-yard line. On the next play, he connected with Maynard in the end zone, giving the Jets a 27–23 lead at the 7:47 mark. Oakland had three more drives with the time remaining, but failed to score each time. Oakland took the ball after Maynard's touchdown and drove to New York's 26-yard line, where they ended up faced with 4th down and 10. Even though more than 5 minutes remained in the game, Rauch decided to try to go for a first down rather than kick a field goal, but this did not pay off as Lamonica was sacked by New York lineman Verlon Biggs on the next play. Following a punt, Oakland drove to the New York 24-yard line, only to lose the ball again when Lamonica's intended swing pass to Charlie Smith sailed behind him, resulting in an accidental fumbled lateral that was recovered by linebacker Ralph Baker. The next time the Raiders got the ball, it was on their own 22-yard line with 42 seconds left in regulation. The Jets defense managed to stop the drive at midfield as time expired to preserve their lead and win the game, avenging their regular season loss to the Raiders in the infamous Heidi Game six weeks earlier.\nNeither quarterback distinguished themselves with passing accuracy. Namath completed 19 of 49 passes for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Lamonica completed 20 of 47 passes for 401 yards and a touchdown. Biletnikoff was the leading receiver of the game with 7 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown, while Maynard caught 6 passes for 118 yards and a score.

        "title": "1969 American Football League Championship Game",
        "text": "The 1969 AFL Championship Game was the 10th and final championship game of the American Football League, and the league's final game prior to its merger with the National Football League on February 1, 1970. \nThe game was held on January 4, 1970, at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum between the Western Division champion Oakland Raiders (12–1–1) and the division's second-place team, the Kansas City Chiefs (11–3). The two teams had the best records in the AFL regular season and both had won divisional playoff games two weeks earlier to advance to the championship. Oakland had swept the two hard-fought regular season games between the two teams, were favored by 4 to 5½ points, and had taken seven of the last eight meetings.\nTied at halftime, the Chiefs won 17–7 on the strength of seventeen unanswered points in the last three quarters and represented the AFL in Super Bowl IV the following week. This was the 616th and final AFL game.\nGame summary.\nThe Chiefs edged out Oakland 17–7 in a hard fought defensive struggle in which both teams combined for just 440 yards (233 for Oakland, 207 for KC) and each lost four turnovers. It was a very satisfying win for Kansas City, who had been swept by the Raiders during the season and lost 7 of their last 8 meetings, including a crushing 41–6 loss in the previous year's postseason.\nThe Raiders opened up the scoring with a 66-yard drive, featuring Daryle Lamonica's 24-yard completion to Warren Wells on the Chiefs' 3-yard line. Running back Charlie Smith ran the ball across the goal line on the next play, giving Oakland a 7-0 lead. Both defenses would take over the majority of the rest of the half, but with 3:24 remaining in the second quarter, Kansas City, who had only gained two first downs up to now, drove 75 yards to tie the game. Quarterback Len Dawson started off the drive with a 14-yard completion to Otis Taylor, while Robert Holmes' 8-yard run moved the ball into Raiders territory on their 42 for the first time in the game as the clock ran down to the 2-minute warning. On the next play, Dawson threw a 41-yard completion to receiver Frank Pitts. Then Wendell Hayes scored a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game at seven at halftime.\nOakland seemed primed to respond in the third quarter with a drive to the Chiefs' 33-yard line, but in what turned out to be a crucial play, Lamonica jammed his thumb and fingers when his throwing hand struck the helmet of Chiefs defensive end Aaron Brown, and he had to miss the rest of the drive. Backup George Blanda took over and tried to take the team the rest of the way to the end zone, but a few players later, defensive back Emmitt Thomas made a clutch interception on the Chiefs' 5-yard line. Kansas City then drove 95 yards for a go-ahead score. The key play on the drive with a 35-yard reception by Taylor through triple coverage with the team facing 3rd and 13 from their own 2-yard line. Dawson later completed a 23-yard pass to Holmes on the drive, and defensive back Nemiah Wilson's pass interference penalty eventually gave Kansas City a first down on the Raiders' 7-yard line. Holmes carried the ball three straight times after that, the last a 5-yard touchdown run to put the Chiefs up 14–7.\nLamonica returned to the game in the 4th quarter, but was unable to lead the Raiders to any points, despite numerous opportunities. A promising drive into Kansas City territory was eliminated when Jim Kearney intercepted Lamonica's pass on the Chiefs 18-yard line. Two plays later, defensive end Carlton Oats recovered a fumble from Holmes on the Chiefs' 24. But on the next play, Oakland gave the ball right back with an interception to rookie cornerback Jim Marsalis. Amazingly, Oakland got the ball back on another Holmes fumble, this one recovered by linebacker Dan Conners on the Chiefs' 31. Still, the only result would be another Lamonica interception, this one to Thomas, who returned it 62 yards to the Raiders' 18-yard line, setting up Jan Stenerud's 22-yard field goal that increased Kansas City's lead to 17–7. Oakland had one last chance to get back in the game when defensive end Ike Lassiter recovered a fumble from Dawson on the Kansas City 13 with two minutes left. But Lamonica threw four straight incompletions and the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock.\nNeither quarterback had a particularly good day. Dawson completed only 7 of 17 passes for 129 yards, while Lamonica finished 15/39 for 167 yards and three interceptions. Charlie Smith was the sole offensive star of the game, with 31 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 8 receptions for 86 yards.\nOfficials.\nThe AFL (and NFL) had six game officials in 1969; the seventh official, the side judge, was added in .\nPlayers' shares.\nThe Chiefs players each received $7,000 and the Raiders players about $5,000 each. With the win, the Chiefs were guaranteed an additional $7,500 each, the loser's share in the Super Bowl; the Super Bowl winners earned $15,000 each.\nAftermath.\nThe Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl against the Minnesota Vikings, in a final showing of the AFL and its strength. Kansas City is the only team in the Super Bowl era to win the title without allowing as much as ten points in any postseason game.\nThe two leagues merged into one after this game, with the ten AFL teams and three NFL teams (Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Colts, and Cleveland Browns) forming the American Football Conference. Super Bowl V was the first game for that conference, which the Colts won. After losing their first two appearances in 1993 and 2018, The Chiefs won the AFC Championship in 2019 and 2020. Conversely, the Raiders have appeared in eleven, winning four and losing seven; their last appearance (and win) was in 2002."

Houston again was named SAC Coach of the Year and drew interest from several larger programs, as the Bears set an NCAA all-division rushing record.\nThe Citadel.\nHouston was hired as the 24th head coach at The Citadel in January 2014. After a 5–7 opening season, he led the 2015 Bulldogs to their first conference championship since 1992, and only third in program history. They also made their first playoff appearance in 23 years. For his efforts, Houston was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year.\nJames Madison.\nOn January 18, 2016, Houston was named as head coach of the Dukes football program. Houston had a successful tenure as head coach of the Dukes as he led them to three NCS Playoff appearances and two national title game appearances. In 2016 Houston guided the Dukes to a 14-1 record and the 2016 NCAA Division I FCS Football Championship following a 28-14 win over No. 13 Youngstown State. In 2017, Houston led JMU to a 14-1 record and an appearance in the national title game where the Dukes had their only loss of the season as they were beaten by North Dakota State 17-13.\nEast Carolina.\nHouston became the Pirates' 22nd head coach on December 4, 2018. Houston, along with his assembled coaching staff, were responsible for turning around an ECU football program with five consecutive losing seasons dating back to 2015. Houston led the Pirates to their first winning season in six years in 2021, finishing at a 7-5 record. Houston made his first FBS bowl game (Military Bowl) in 2021 against Boston College. Due to COVID-19 protocols, Boston College had to back out of the game so it became a no-contest. Houston and staff led the 2022 ECU football team to a 8-5 record and a victory in the Birmingham Bowl against Coastal Carolina University."

        "text": "The 1967–68 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team represented the University of Illinois.\nRegular season.\nHarv Schmidt, the 1957 Illini MVP and team captain, returned to his alma mater in 1967 after\nserving as an assistant at New Mexico for three years. Schmidt succeeded legendary coach Harry Combes after his dismissal related to a \"slush-fund\" scandal that devastated both the basketball and football programs for many years into the future. Schmidt, originally from Kankakee, was the slender 6 foot 6 inch star Illini forward who came highly recommended as both a coach and recruiter. Unfortunately, he had never been a head coach before, but he was considered the best the under the circumstances. Within three years of his arrival, he had brought Illinois back to among the elite programs in the Big Ten. The beginning of his tenure marked what possibly was the high-water mark in fan enthusiasm. Illinois led the nation in attendance in 1970,\naveraging 16,128 per home contest, with students routinely camped out for tickets outside\nthe state-of-the-art Assembly Hall.\nEven though Schmidt lacked coaching experience, he believed in the importance of an aggressive, overplaying defense with the intent of frustrating opponents, generating turnovers and creating easy baskets. He was a stickler to detail and used scouting techniques to learn ways of shutting down opponents offenses. Schmidt was always teaching, as well as coaching his teams, in order to compete favorably against any competition.\nDue to the scandal that plagued the Illini, Schmidt's first team was primarily made up of walk-ons. Expectations of the 1967–68 team were low, however, they began to surprise even the experts when, in just their second game of the season, the Illini took on hall of fame player Elvin Hayes and the nationally ranked Houston Cougars at the Assembly Hall. During the matchup, Randy Crews, a 6-foot 5 inch high school All-American guard from Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School, became a defensive stopper in just his second varsity game by taking on the 6 foot 9 inch Hayes. The Illini were forced to use a slow-down style to keep the game close and stayed with the Cougars the whole game, losing by a final score of 54-46.\nDuring the remainder of the season, the Illini defeated such teams as Georgia Tech, Texas El Paso, Notre Dame, Michigan State, Iowa and Michigan. Unfortunately, the Ilini would lose 7 of their last 9 games of the Big Ten season to finish with a 6-8 conference record and an 11-13 mark overall, good for a second straight 7th-place finish in the Big Ten.\nPositive signs for the Illini included a freshman team that included future varsity players Greg Jackson, Fred Miller, Rick Howat and Bob Windmiller. As sophomores, they would combine with returnees Dave Scholz, Randy Crews, future New York Knicks draft pick Mike Price, Alabama transfer Jodie Harrison, Dennis Pace and walk-on Les Busboom to form the best group Schmidt would ever coach. Scholz would finish this season by being named 1st team All-American by the Helms Foundation and to the Converse honorable mention All-American team.\nThe 1967-68 team's starting lineup included Crews and Benny Louis at the forward spots, Price and Harrison as guards and Scholz at center.\nSchedule.\n \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season\n "

        "text": "The sport of surfing is practiced in Turkey, which offers warm waters of the Mediterranean on the south as well as wind swells of the Black Sea on the north. The wave period is shorter than the ocean waves but can reach up to periods of 11-12 second swells although the average swell period is 6–7 seconds.\nSouthern Turkey, the Mediterranean side, is said to be a popular surf destination for winter months due to its warm blue waters, versatile waves, historic seaside towns, and traditional Turkish cuisine. Winter season is the high season for waves and the low season for tourist activity lowering the accommodation prices.\nAlanya, a tourist town located in southern Turkey, produces large waves for the Mediterranean consistently reaching 20 surfable days a month in the winter/spring time (December, January, February, March, and April). During these months climate in this town averages 65 F with water temperatures averaging 65 F to 70 F. Ideal swells for this region accumulates from south, southeast, or east-south-east directions with southeast swells producing longer period, large waves.\nIn Alanya; Damlatas beach offers hollow tubing waves and Keykubat beach produces waves suitable both for long and short-board surfing suitable for both beginners and experts alike. It is possible to find waves in this part of Mediterranean ranging anywhere from one to 12 feet. North of Turkey; Black Sea also offers rideable waves of different range from one to 12 feet. Nowadays, you can usually encounter a handful of local surfers regularly in the region. \nHistory.\nWith the great efforts of Tunc Ucyildiz and Turkish American Sports Club; formal modern surfing history in [Turkey] started with the 1st National Surfing Championship held in Istanbul. Tunc Ucyildiz not only won the first national title but also brought the first organized surfing event to Turkey. In 2013, he represented Turkey for the first time in ISA World Surfing Games where national athletes compete. \nThe culture of surfing in Turkey dates back to the time of the Ottoman Empire when the locals used to body surf in the Black Sea region. This particular body surf activity is called \"viya\". This tradition is still in place and many locals are performing \"viya\" in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions to this day."

        "title": "Pakistan Basketball Federation",
        "text": "Pakistan Basketball Federation (PBF) is a national governing body of basketball in Pakistan. It was founded in 1952 for the promotion and development of sport of basketball in the country.\nBrig. (R) M. Iftikhar Mansoor is the current president of the federation, having been elected on 24 January 2022 for a four-year term.\nHistory.\nPre-Independence (1900–1947).\nBasketball was introduced in Punjab by the early 1900s, with the YMCA leading the front in the promotion of the game. Gordon College, Rawalpindi was one of the first schools in the country which began playing the game in 1906, followed by CTI High School in Sialkot. Both of these institutes had a long history in training boys to play the game. The game might have come to Karachi about the same time. Forman Christian College, Lahore introduced the game in 1910.\nSometime during the 1910s, the YMCA began organizing the All-India Basketball Championship and carried it on until in the 1930s.\nIn the late 1920s, basketball one of the regular university sports in the region. The Punjab Olympic Association had its basketball sub-committee established and functioning in the late 1920s or early 1930s, and took the initiative of introducing the games in the Delhi Games in 1934. The game has been in every Olympics since, and the Punjab has won its share of these meets. Since 1947, basketball has been a part of all the National Games.\nPost-Independence (1947–present).\nAt the time of partition in 1947, Dr. S.L. Sheets was the only office-bearer left in the Association, and only eight teams existed. The Karachi Amateur Basketball Association was formed a couple of years later, and that city became an important centre. In the early 1950s, the Services Sports Control Board adopted the international rules to replace the old ones and this had made possible the participation by Services teams with civilian teams at various centres. The game was favourite with PWR and the Police. The Inter-University Sports Board introduced basketball in its first Inter-Varsity Games inaugurated in 1953-54, with the first games held at Peshawar.\nThe Pakistan Amateur Basketball Federation was formally inaugurated in February 1952 and began functioning in early 1953.\nRival factions.\nThe 2000s saw two factions emerge from within the PBF. In 2001, elections were held in Lahore to choose the next president of the federation. The incumbent president, air commodore Afzal Khan, contested against Brigadier Rashid Ali Malik. However, a dispute over the electoral list emerged, causing the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) to hold the elections under its supervision. With the two groups tied at seven votes each, Khan was set to cast the deciding vote, but the Director General of PSB, Saulat Abbas, refused to let him do so, and instead, established an ad hoc administration. The sport suffered during this period, as hardly any national team was sent abroad for participation in international competitions.\nOn 4 October 2006, Muhammad Basharat Raja was unanimously elected as the president of PBF for four years after elections were held by the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. On 19 July 2010, the affiliated associations were invited to a meeting in Lahore to resolve all disputes. They, however, ended up electing a new basketball governing body under Malik. These elections were considered void by the official body as they were held without the presence of the PSB and POA representatives.\nFurther infighting continued with time, and the PSB supporting Malik's, and later, Asif Bajwa's faction. During this time, the POA had recognized Malik's faction.\nSuspension.\nOn 29 June 2013, FIBA suspended the membership of Pakistan Basketball Federation for its support of the unrecognized interim committee of the Pakistan Olympic Association. The main reason cited was the PBF President Asif Bajwa's leadership of the interim committee, which was viewed as being in defiance of the Olympic Charter. This interim setup, with the support of the Pakistan Sports Board, was organizing its own edition of the National Games at the time of suspension.\nThe suspension was lifted on 13 August 2015 after FIBA recognized the federation being run by Brig. Rashid Ali Malik\nA goodwill tour of Pakistan men's national basketball team was arranged by Pakistan Basketball Federation in 2017.\nAffiliations.\nThe Federation is affiliated with:"

        "text": "Paul Richardson Jr. (born April 13, 1992) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes and was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft. He also played for the Washington Redskins.\nEarly years.\nRichardson attended Junípero Serra High School in Gardena, California and Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California. During his high school career, he had 110 receptions for 1,948 yards and 28 touchdowns. He was also a letterman in basketball and track. In track, he had career-bests of 10.62 in the 100 meters, 21 seconds in the 200 meters and 40.66 seconds in the 4x100.\nCollege career.\nRichardson originally attended UCLA, but was dismissed from the team prior to his freshman season after being placed under arrest for felony theft of a purse, along with his cousin Shaquille Richardson and another teammate, Josh Shirley. He then attended the University of Colorado Boulder. He played in all 12 games that year, recording 34 receptions for 514 yards and six touchdowns. As a sophomore in 2011, he played in nine games recording 39 receptions for 555 yards and five touchdowns. He missed four games due to injury. In April 2012, he tore his ACL which caused him to miss the season. He returned as a starter in 2013. During the season, he set the school record for receiving yards in a season of 1,343 yards. At the end of the season, Richardson announced his intent to declare for the 2014 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks (first stint).\nRichardson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round (45th overall) in the 2014 NFL draft. He made his NFL debut in the season opener against the Green Bay Packers but was not targeted. In Week 3 against the Denver Broncos, Richardson caught his first career NFL reception, which was for seven yards. In Week 13, he caught what would have been his first NFL touchdown, but it was called back due to a penalty. During Week 15, he caught his first NFL touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers. Richardson finished with 29 receptions, 271 yards, and a touchdown in his rookie season. In Seattle's opening matchup against the Carolina Panthers, after only having one reception for 21 yards, he went down in the third quarter with what was first believed to be a sprained knee at the time, was later revealed to be a torn ACL upon further inspection. He was then placed on injured reserve, ending his 2014–15 rookie campaign. On December 5, 2015, after making a 40-yard catch, Richardson hurt his hamstring and was subsequently placed on injured reserve.\nRichardson had a relatively quiet season again in 2016, until starting wide receiver Tyler Lockett suffered a season-ending injury in Week 16. In the of the playoffs against the Detroit Lions, he recorded three catches for 48 yards, including a one-handed touchdown catch on 4th and goal.\nIn 2017, Richardson had his best season to date with career highs with receptions (44), receiving yards (703), and touchdowns (6).\nWashington Redskins.\nRichardson signed a five-year, $40 million contract with the Washington Redskins on March 15, 2018. On September 9, 2018, Richardson made his Redskins debut, catching four passes for 22 yards in the season-opening win against the Arizona Cardinals. On September 16, Richardson recorded a season-high 63 yards on four receptions against the Indianapolis Colts. The following week, he recorded his first touchdown as a Redskin, scoring on a 46-yard reception against the Packers. On October 14, in Week 6, Richardson caught three passes for 31 yards and a touchdown against the Carolina Panthers, his second touchdown of the season. On November 5, he was placed on injured reserve with a shoulder injury. In the 2018 season, he appeared in seven games and recorded 20 receptions for 262 receiving yards and two touchdowns.\nIn Week 3 of the 2019 season against the Chicago Bears, Richardson caught eight passes for 83 yards and a touchdown. He was placed on injured reserve on December 14, 2019, after struggling with a nagging hamstring injury for several weeks. He finished the 2019 season with 28 receptions for 245 receiving yards and two touchdowns in ten games.\nOn February 14, 2020, Richardson was released by the Redskins.\nSeattle Seahawks (second stint).\nRichardson re-signed with the Seahawks on August 29, 2020. On September 5, 2020, Richardson was released from the Seahawks."

        "text": "The 1990–91 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1990–91 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 19th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 19-13, 8-8 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1991 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the final before losing to Seton Hall. They were the No. 8 seed in the West Region of the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 13th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and advanced to the second round before losing to West Region No. 1 seed Nevada-Las Vegas. They were ranked No. 23 in the final Coaches' Poll of the season.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown radio voice Rich Chvotkin, who had broadcast every Georgetown men's basketball game since his debut in the 1974-75 season, missed most of this season after mobilizing for six months of United States Army Reserve service during the Gulf War shortly after calling the December 5 game against Duke. He would resume his Georgetown broadcasting duties the following season.\nIn the season opener at Hawaii Loa, senior center and team captain Dikembe Mutombo had 32 points, 21 rebounds, and 11 blocked shots, only the second recorded triple-double in Georgetown history. Eight days later he played against his older brother Ilo Mutombo in a game against Southern Indiana, scoring only six points and pulling down nine rebounds, while Ilo had 14 points and 11 rebounds against him.\nIn the fourth game of the year, Mutumbo had 13 rebounds and junior center Alonzo Mourning scored 22 points and pulled down 10 rebounds against Duke in the seasons fourth game. The Hoyas held Duke freshman forward Grant Hill, sophomore point guard Bobby Hurley, and junior center Christian Laettner to a combined 9-for-42 (21.4%) shooting effort from the field, the Blue Devils as a whole shot only 32% from the field, and Georgetown won 79-74. Toward the end of the game Mourning injured the arch of his foot, forcing him to miss the next nine games. Averaging 22 points per game through the first four games, he returned to action in mid-January 1991, but recovering from the injury reduced his performance until early March. He then returned to form, averaging 18.6 points and 9.5 rebounds per game over the last six games of the season. He finished the year third in scoring on the team with an average of 15.8 points per game and shooting 52.2 percent from the field and 79.3 percent from the free-throw line.\nMournings injury problems after the Duke game meant that Mutombo had an opportunity to build on his success of the last two seasons and come to the fore as Georgetowns \"big man.\" Previously scoring mostly on dunks, he began to take more difficult shots. Although this caused his shooting percentage from the field to drop to 58%, he led Georgetown in points scored. Against Jackson State, he shot 13-for-16 (81.3%) from the field and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free-throw line to score a career-high 34 points. In 16 straight games from December 1990 through mid-February 1991, he led the team in rebounds. He finished the season averaging 15.2 points per game.\nFreshman Robert Churchwell joined the team, succeeding Jaren Jackson at small forward. He started all 32 of the teams games, averaging 8.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. In Big East conference play, he scored in double figures eight times and shot 47% from the field, including a 10-for-11 (90.9%) outing against Providence.\nAnother newcomer was freshman guard Joey Brown. The teams point guard, he also started all 32 games and had a combined 31 points and 19 assists in the first three games of the season. He led the Hoyas in both assists and steals and, although he shot only 18-for-78 (32.1%) from three-point range over the season as a whole and only 26% from the field at any distance during the last seven games of the year, he scored in double figures 13 times, including a season-high 21 points at Villanova.\nWith a bye in the first round of the 1991 Big East tournament, Georgetown faced Connecticut in the quarterfinals. Although shooting only 28% from the field, the Hoyas managed to win 68-49, with Mutombo scoring 13 points and pulling down 27 rebounds and Mourning shooting 15-for-16 (93.8%) from the free-throw line. Georgetown then defeated Providence in the semifinals to advance to the championship game, which the Hoyas lost to 21st-ranked Seton Hall 74-62 despite Mournings 22-point, 13-rebound effort. It was Georgetowns first loss in the Big East tournament final in seven appearances. Mutombo had scored a combined 34 points and collected a total of 44 rebounds during the tournament.\nThe Hoyas were the No. 8 seed in the West Region of the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 13th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and defeated Vanderbilt in the first round. In the second round, they lost to West Region No. 1 seed Nevada-Las Vegas, the second consecutive year in which they had been knocked out of the tournament in the second round. They had fallen out of the Associated Press Poll Top 25 by the end of the season, but were ranked No. 23 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nMutombo had spent his freshman year playing intramural basketball and had not joined the varsity team until his sophomore year, and he therefore had a year of collegiate eligibility left after the end of the season. However, he opted to forego a fifth year at Georgetown to graduate on time in May 1991 and move on to a 15-season professional career in the National Basketball Association. During his three seasons with the Hoyas he had averaged one block for every six and a half minutes he had played, and he left with the third-highest career blocked-shot total in school history and averaging 9.8 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. Despite having both Mutombo and Mourning on the team during those three years, Georgetown had not returned to the Final Four, largely because an unusually high number of scholarship players – 11 of 23 – transferred from Georgetown between 1987-1988 and 1992-1993, preventing the team from building a core of veterans to play with its two dominating centers. Without that core of veterans, the Mourning-Mutombo teams were unable to replicate the success of the veteran-filled Patrick Ewing teams of the early 1980s, which had reached the Final Four – and indeed the national championship game – three times in four seasons.\nRoster.\nSource\nJunior guard Ronny Thompson was the son of head coach John Thompson, Jr.\nRankings.\nSource\n1990–91 Schedule and results.\nSources\nThe 33,048 people in attendance at the Carrier Dome for the Georgetown-Syracuse game of March 3, 1991, constituted what was then the largest on-campus crowd to witness a basketball game in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Arthur Lynch (born June 17, 1990) is a former American football tight end. He was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL draft. He played college football at Georgia.\nEarly years.\nLynch attended Dartmouth High School in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where his grandfather had previously been a coach for 36 years and had a 202–79–9 record. In his junior season, he primarily served as a blocker for Jordan Todman, who would later become an All-American at the University of Connecticut and an NFL running back. During that season, he had 10 receptions for 160 yards and two touchdowns, as well as 63 tackles and four sacks. Dartmouth finished the regular season as champions of the Old Colony League with an 11–1 record. In the State Semifinal, they defeated Brockton High School with a score of 40–7, and lost in overtime in the Division-I Super Bowl against Everett High School.\nDuring the 2008 season, Lynch was one of captains, all of whom continued their football careers at the collegiate level. In his senior year, Lynch continued to excel both on offense and defense. He made 16 receptions for 249 yards and scored three touchdowns. Defensively, he produced 55 tackles, 11.0 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks, 9 hurries, and 3 forced fumbles. Dartmouth finished the regular season as undefeated champions of the Old Colony League. In the Division-I State Semifinal, they lost 20–13 to Brockton High School. Lynch was named to the Massachusetts High School Football Coaches Association All-State \"Super 26\" team and received recognition as a Boston Globe and Boston Herald All-Scholastic. He served as team captain and was honored by having his No. 88 jersey retired, which is now on display in the Dartmouth High School Field House named after his grandfather. Additionally, he played varsity basketball under the guidance of Steve Gaspar, the winningest basketball coach in the school's history. Notably, he also held the position of Class President.\nAs a recruit, Lynch was highly regarded, receiving a four-star rating from \"Rivals.com.\" He was recognized as the top recruit in Massachusetts, the second-best tight end prospect nationally, and ranked 121st overall in the country by Rivals. In the spring of 2008, he committed to playing for Jeff Jagodzinski and the Boston College Eagles, which was not only his choice but also the alma mater of both his mother and sister. However, he later reopened his recruitment that summer, and proceeded to visit various universities including Florida, Georgia, NC State, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. Prior to his senior season, Lynch verbally committed to playing for Mark Richt at the University of Georgia, a team that began the college football season ranked #1 in the country. On National Signing Day, which took place on February 4, 2009, he signed his National Letter of Intent to join the Georgia Bulldogs. The signing helped contribute to the Bulldogs #4 overall class ranking in the country according to Scout.com.

In recognition of his academic achievements, Lynch was named to the Athletic Director's Honor Roll for the Summer and Fall Semesters, and he also earned Dean's List recognition during the Summer Semester.\n2010.\nDuring his sophomore year, the coaching staff decided to redshirt Lynch, which allowed him to extend his eligibility and further develop his skills. Additionally, he received recognition for his academic achievements by being named to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Academic Honor Roll.\n2011.\nIn his redshirt sophomore year, Lynch served as a backup to Orson Charles and played in 13 games.\n2012.\nAfter the 2011 season, Orson Charles, the All-American tight end, decided to enter the NFL draft, creating an opportunity for Lynch to step into the starting. Leading up to the 2012 season, Lynch had primarily been utilized as a blocking tight end. However, as the season progressed, he showcased his abilities as a reliable pass catcher. Throughout the 2012 season, Lynch played in 14 games, starting in 13 of them. He recorded 24 receptions for 431 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nOn September 15, 2012, Lynch caught his first collegiate touchdown against the Florida Atlantic Owls.

Lynch, along with his roommate Murray and Garrison Smith, represented the University of Georgia football team at the 2013 SEC Media Days, where Lynch was named to the Pre-Season Media Days All-SEC Team. Georgia began the season ranked #5 in both the preseason Coaches' and AP Poll.\nGeorgia opened the season vs. their rival, #8 ranked Clemson Tigers, in Memorial Stadium, also known as 'Death Valley.' The game was picked for ESPN College Football GameDay game-of-the-week and was hosted by the show's signature crew which at the time included Chris Fowler, Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard, and former Georgia Football player, David Pollack. Georgia would lose the game 38-35 and Lynch would have 1 catch for 18 yards.\nIn the following week, Georgia faced off against the #6 ranked South Carolina Gamecocks, a game that showcased the talents of future No. 1 overall pick Jadeveon Clowney. Georgia emerged victorious with a 41–30 win, and Lynch recorded 3 catches for 26 yards and a touchdown.\nOn September 29, 2012, Georgia hosted #6 ranked LSU Tigers in another highly anticipated matchup, featuring former Georgia Quarterback and Athens, Georgia native Zach Mettenberger. ESPN's College GameDay crew returned for the second time that season to cover the game. The game revolved around the performances of Murray and Mettenberger, who were recruited to Georgia and were once roommates. Both quarterbacks delivered impressive performances, culminating in a thrilling 44–41 victory for Georgia, as their defense halted a Mettenberger-led-fourth-quarter comeback. Murray threw for 298 yards and 4 touchdowns, while Lynch contributed with 3 catches for 40 yards.\nOn Saturday, November 2, 2012, Lynch sustained an injury when tackled by Florida linebacker Antonio Morrison, resulting in a lacerated kidney and several bruised ribs. Despite passing blood in his urine Lynch finished the game. He sat out the subsequent game against Appalachian State due to his kidney laceration, marking the only game he missed due to injury throughout his collegiate career. In total, Lynch appeared and started in 12 games, recording 30 passes for 459 yards and leading all receivers with 5 touchdowns.\nThe Bulldogs finished the regular season 8-4 and ranked No. 23 in the AP Poll. They earned a New Year's Six Bowl berth and accepted an invitation to play Nebraska in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl. In his final collegiate game, Lynch had one of his best statistical performances of his career, catching 6 passes for 69 yards. However, he dropped a crucial pass that ended Georgia's potential game-winning drive in the fourth quarter. Georgia lost the game 24-19 and finished the season unranked.\nFollowing the season, Lynch was named to the Associated Press, SEC Coaches, and \"Sporting News\" All-SEC 1st Team. He also received an \"Sports Illustrated\" All-America Honorable Mention. Lynch was voted Offensive Team Captain by his teammates and finished his career with 56 receptions for 907 yards and eight touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nAfter completing his college career, Lynch prepared for the NFL Combine by training at IMG Academy alongside other NFL prospects such as Teddy Bridgewater, CJ Mosley, and Ryan Shazier. He received an invitation to the Reese's Senior Bowl, a prestigious all-star game held annually in Mobile, Alabama, featuring the top NFL draft prospects who have finished their college eligibility.\nLynch attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, where he participated in various field drills, psychological evaluations, and medical tests. He ranked Top-10 among tight ends in multiple categories, including the second-highest number of bench press repetitions of 225 lbs. with 28, trailing only Joe Jon Duncan, of Dixie State.\nLeading up to the draft, Lynch was highly regarded by analysts and considered one of the top tight end prospects in the 2014 draft class. Greg Cosell, Senior Producer of NFL Films, compared him to the accomplished Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Heath Miller. Various outlets, including Bleacher Report, projected Lynch as a potential Day 3 selection in the draft.\nDuring the pre-draft process, Lynch extended his support for Michael Sam, a defensive end from the Missouri Tigers and fellow NFL draft prospect. Sam made history as the first openly gay player in the NFL. In an interview for the Macon Telegraph with Georgia beat writer Seth Emerson, Lynch expressed admiration for Sam, saying, \"Man to man, I think it takes a certain amount of courage and inner strength to do that [come out].\" He offered further support for Sam calling his announcement \"a really big step\" for the gay community.\nMiami Dolphins.\nIn the 2014 NFL draft, Lynch was chosen in 5th round as the 155th overall pick by the Miami Dolphins. He signed his rookie contract on May 22, 2014. Shortly after the draft, Lynch suffered a non-contact injury during the team's voluntary workout, which led to him being placed on injured reserve on August 26, 2014, due to a partial fracture of the L4/L5 Lumbar Spine.\nDuring his time with the Dolphins, Lynch was coached by Dan Campbell, who is currently the head coach of the Detroit Lions.\nLynch was one of two rookies selected to participate in the NFL Business Management &amp; Entrepreneurial Program (BM&amp;E) offered through the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\nOn August 17, 2015, he was waived by the Dolphins following the first pre-season game of the 2015 season.\nNew York Jets.\nLynch was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets on August 19, 2015.

To address the lingering Strep Virus infection, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was attached through his armpit prior to his discharge. Following a six-month period of antibiotics and rehabilitation, Lynch made the decision to retire from football.\nPersonal life.\nLynch was originally named Arthur Charles Fontaine II, named after his great-grandfather on his father's side.

        "text": "The 1931–32 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1931–32 NCAA college basketball season. Fred Mesmer coached it in his first season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Tech Gymnasium on the campus of McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C. The team finished with a record of 6-11.\nMesmer had played guard on Georgetowns 1927-28, 1928-29, and 1929-30 teams before graduating in 1930. Less than two years after graduation, he was hired at the age of 23 as the Hoyas head coach. A popular sports figure on campus, he would coach Georgetown for seven seasons, leaving after the end of the 1937-38 season with an overall record of 53-76. Although his teams would go 36-20 (.643) at home, they would manage only a 17-56 (.233) record on the road, and he would have only two winning seasons – 1933-34 and 1936-37 – during his tenure.\nThis was Georgetowns last season as an independent before beginning a seven-season stint the following year as a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\n1931–32 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the games played against the Crescent Athletic Club and the Brooklyn Knights of Columbus therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1931-32. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

It retained the same point format adopted for the 2013 Women's Ashes: the Ashes were decided based on a points system, taking account not only of the one Test match, but also the results of limited-overs games. Six points are awarded for a Test victory (two points to each side in the event of a draw), and two points for a victory in any of the WODIs and WT20I games.\nThe only Test match of the tour took place on 10–13 January at Perth. England won the match by 61 runs. Three One Day Internationals were played: the first and second at Melbourne on 19 and 23 January were won by England and Australia respectively, and the third at Hobart on 26 January, was won by Australia. Three Twenty20 matches were also played, scheduled as \"double-headed\" events alongside the men's T20 matches between Australia and England. England won the first T20 at Hobart on 29 January, giving them an unassailable 10–4 points lead in the series, and thus retaining the Women's Ashes. The final two T20 matches played on 31 January and 2 February, at Melbourne and Sydney respectively were both won by Australia. The three T20s were double-headers along with men's T20 Matches.\nIn-between tourists also played a match against the Australia A Women on 6–7 January at Floreat Park Oval, Perth, which was drawn.\nThey also played a 50-overs limited over warm-up against Cricket Australia Chairman's Women's XI on 19 January at Junction Oval, Melbourne, won by CA Women's XI by 2 wickets.\nThe final points total was Australia 8, England 10."

Contributors can be a coach or any other individual who has greatly contributed to the success of kicking in American football.\nEighteen people have been inducted into the American Football Kicking Hall of Fame. Of them, six are also in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, some of whom were inducted into the latter for non-kicking achievements.\nThe annual induction ceremony is during the Augusta (Ga.) Sports Council's All-Area Football Banquet in January."

        "text": "The 1927–28 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1927–28 NCAA college basketball season. Elmer Ripley coached it in his first season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at the Arcade Rink, also known as the Arcadia and as the Arcade Auditorium, in Washington, D.C., which it had also used for home games from 1911 to 1914.\nRipley played professional basketball, including with the \"Original Celtics,\" from 1908 to 1930, coached for three seasons from 1922 to 1925 at Wagner College with an overall record of 23–22, and was being pursued by George Preston Marshalls Washington Palace Five team of the professional American Basketball League in 1927 when Georgetown hired him as head coach. He immediately showed great talent for coaching, leading the Hoyas to a 12–1 record. During three separate stints as head coach, Ripley would coach Georgetown for a combined ten seasons between 1927 and 1949 and lead the school to its first post-season tournament appearance when it advanced to the final game of the 1943 NCAA Tournament.\nSeason recap.\nOn-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games from the 1914–15 season through the 1926–27 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses and limiting Georgetown to an average of no more than three road games a year from the 1918-19 season through the previous season. Georgetown Athletic Director Lou Little allowed Ripley to schedule home games off campus this season for the first time since the 1913-14 season in order to generate greater revenue to pay for travel expenses; although this season the Hoyas continued the pattern of playing virtually all of their games at home, they would finally begin to travel more regularly again the following season. It was the Arcade Rinks last season hosting Georgetown men's basketball games, but it was only the first of 22 straight seasons of off-campus home games for the Hoyas, who would not have an on-campus home court again until the opening of McDonough Arena for the 1951-52 season.\nSenior forward and team captain Bob Nork was the teams leader for the third straight year, playing in all 13 games, scoring 97 points, and averaging 7.2 points per game. He averaged 8.8 points per game over his collegiate career.\nSophomore guard Fred Mesmer joined the team this season and immediately became a starter and one of the teams leaders. He was an important defensive presence for the team during the season and a skilled passer. He scored in all 13 games, averaging 7.1 points per game.\nSophomore center Don Dutton, Mesmers high school teammate, also joined the team this year. He started every game and was a strong rebounder and offensive player. His average of 8.8 points per game was the highest for a Georgetown center since the 1907-08 season.\nThe teams 12–1 record was the best Georgetown finish since the 1919-20 team's 13–1 season. Its only loss was to nationally renowned New York University, and its February 14, 1928, victory over Navy was Georgetowns first win over Navy since January 23, 1909, bringing to an end a 15-game Hoya losing streak against the Midshipmen.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\nSophomore guard Fred Mesmer would become Georgetowns head coach for the 1931-32 season and coach the Hoyas for seven seasons.\n1927–28 schedule and results.\nSources\nGeorgetowns victory at Navy this season was its first over the Midshipmen since 1909. In the interim, the Hoyas had lost 15 straight games to Navy.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

John Thompson, coached them in his 26th season as head coach. They began the season in November 1997 playing their home games at US Airways Arena in Landover, Maryland, but in December 1997 moved to their new home court, the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.; they also played two home games early in the season at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. They were members of the Big East 7 Division of the Big East Conference and finished the season 16–15, 6–12 in Big East play. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the 1998 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Rutgers. Not invited to the NCAA tournament after playing in it during 18 of the previous 19 seasons, they instead appeared in the 1998 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) – the first of three consecutive Georgetown NIT appearances – advancing to the second round before losing to Georgia Tech.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1997–98 season began after a difficult offseason for the Georgetown men's basketball program. Like guard Allen Iverson in 1996, standout point guard Victor Page had broken with the Georgetown tradition of playing a full four years, leaving school after his sophomore season to enter the NBA draft. During the summer of 1997, forward Shamel Jones and guard-forward Jerry Nichols had transferred to Memphis and Mississippi Valley State, respectively, and in August 1997 guard Ed Sheffey had been dismissed from the team before beginning his sophomore season and had transferred to New Mexico State. These losses meant that the Hoyas would have a depleted roster for 1997–98. Making matters worse, one of Georgetowns more promising recruits, freshman center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, played only six games before suffering a season-ending wrist injury, followed by knee surgery. Senior center Jahidi White started the season showing signs that he would have his best season ever, averaging in double figures in scoring and posting five of his eight career double-doubles in the first 10 games of the season, but he lasted little longer than Boumtje-Boumtje; after scoring 10 points and grabbing eight rebounds against West Virginia, he, too, suffered a season-ending wrist injury that brought his college career to an end after the tenth game of the year. And freshman guard Kenny Brunner played in 19 games, starting all of them and averaging 11.2 points per game, but left the team at midseason and transferred to Fresno State.\nThe loss of players meant that Georgetowns roster was reduced to as few as seven players at times. Freshman guard Nat Burton, destined to become one of Georgetowns top players of the era, was thrust into a starting role in only his second collegiate game; he started 17 of the teams 31 games and scored in double figures five times, averaging 5.1 points per game for the year. Sophomore guard-forward Shernard Long finished the year as the Hoyas leading scorer, but senior forward and team captain Boubacar Aw sometimes was the Hoyas only effective offensive player. Although Aw was a poor free-throw shooter, averaging only 53.2 percent from the free-throw line, he shot 52.1 percent from the field for the season and scored in double figures 13 times in his last 18 games, including a 21-point, 18-rebound performance against Seton Hall, and he led Georgetown in scoring in six consecutive games. Aw finished the season behind only Long in scoring, but his 211 points in the regular seasons 18 Big East games was the highest among Georgetown players against conference opponents.\nStaggered by the attrition among its players, the team struggled during the season and often was unable to hold leads. Georgetown had an overall record of only 13–10 and was only 5–9 in Big East play, when Pittsburgh came to the MCI Center on the evening of February 17, 1998. Aw scored a career-high 24 points in the game, but the Hoyas as a team shot only 34 percent from the field and scored a season-low 19 field goals. However, Georgetown kept the game close with an outstanding free-throw shooting performance; averaging only 60 percent from the free throw line as a team entering the game, the Hoyas shot 24-for-28 (85.7%) in free throws in the first half and 14-for-17 (82.4%) during the first 19 minutes 58 seconds of the second half. On the final play of the game, Pittsburgh fouled Aw – who shot a career-best 7-for-8 (87.5%) from the free-throw line during the game – with two seconds left to play and Georgetown trailing 80–78. Aw made the first free throw but missed the second, and the Hoyas lost 80–79. The remarkable team free-throw effort (39-for-46, 84.8%) had fallen one shot short of forcing overtime.\nFollowing the loss to Pittsburgh, the Hoyas dropped two of their final three regular-season games to fall to 14–13 overall and 6–12 in Big East play, leaving them in a three-way tie for last place in the Big East 7 Division. Seeded 13th in the 1998 Big East tournament, they upset No. 4 seed Miami in the first round, but lost in the quarterfinals to No. 12 seed Rutgers. Their 15–14 record after the loss precluded them from receiving an invitation to the 1998 NCAA tournament, and they became only the second Georgetown team to miss the tournament since the 1978–79 season.\nThe Hoyas instead accepted an invitation to the 1998 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), the second Georgetown team to appear in the NIT since the 1992–93 season. In the first round, they met Florida. Although the Gators were a good three-point-shooting team, Georgetowns strong defensive performance allowed the Hoyas to hold a lead for much of the game, and Georgetown led 69–62 with 2:15 remaining in the game. But the Hoyas again could not hold on to a lead; they failed to score on three straight possessions, while Florida scored seven points in the next 1:10, tying the game at 69–69 with a three-pointer with 1:05 left to play. With the score still tied 69–69, Georgetown lost the ball and Florida called a timeout with 22 seconds left to set up a game-winning shot. When play resumed, Floridas Kenyon Weeks drove toward the basket to make the shot, but Georgetown sophomore center Jameel Watkins stole the ball from him and passed it to sophomore guard Damien Bolden, who dribbled across halfcourt. Bolden passed the ball to Aw, who drove toward the basket before dishing the ball off to Shernard Long. Long scored to give Georgetown a dramatic last-second 71–69 win.\nGeorgetown advanced to the second round of the NIT to face Georgia Tech. The game went into overtime, but Georgia Tech ultimately prevailed 80–79 to knock the Hoyas out of the tournament. The 1997–98 Hoyas finished the season with an overall 16–15 (.516) record, the poorest Georgetown record since the 1973–74 teams 13–13 (.500) finish.\nThis was the last of Georgetowns three seasons as a member of the Big East 7 Division. For the following season, the Big East scrapped its Big East 6 and Big East 7 divisional structure and returned to play as a unified conference.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in the AP Poll at any time.

        "title": "1996–97 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1996–97 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 25th season as head coach. Their home court was USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East 7 Division of the Big East Conference, were the regular-season champions of the Big East 7 Division, and finished the season with a record of 20-10, 11-7 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1997 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the semifinals before losing to Boston College. They received a No. 10 seed in the West Regional of the 1997 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – Georgetowns 18th NCAA Tournament appearance in 19 years – and lost to No. 7 seed North Carolina-Charlotte in the first round.\nSeason recap.\nThe graduation of center Othella Harrington and forward Jerome Williams in May 1996 and the departure of guard Allen Iverson after his sophomore season the previous year left the Hoyas with an uncertain lineup for 1996-97. Thompson hoped that freshman forward Shamel Jones and junior guard-forward Jerry Nichols would fill the gaps, but they did not rise to the occasion. With Harrington and Williams gone, however, junior forward Boubacar Aw became the leader in the frontcourt, scoring in 29 of the teams 30 games. He scored in double figures 12 times. Junior Jahidi White, meanwhile, took over at center. In an early Big East game against Seton Hall in December 1996, he scored 12 points and had 16 rebounds, and against Massachusetts two days later he scored 14 points and blocked six shots. He blocked at least one shot in 27 of the teams 30 games and finished the year averaging 7.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.9 blocked shots per game for the season.\nSophomore point guard Victor Page was the star of the team. He continued his high-scoring performance of the previous season, leading the team in scoring in 27 of its 30 games and scoring 20 or more points 21 times during the year and 25 or more points four times by the end of January 1997. The team opened 8-1, but despite Pages efforts, it fell to 11-7 overall and a 4-6 conference record with an 89-71 loss at USAir Arena to Pittsburgh on January 25, 1997. With 14th-ranked Villanova scheduled next and six of their remaining eight games on the road, the Hoyas hopes of making even the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), let alone the NCAA tournament, were beginning to fade.\nGeorgetown hosted Villanova two days after the loss to Pittsburgh. The Hoyas had a tremendous first half and led by as many as 21 points before Villanova went on a 17-0 run early in the second half. The Wildcats managed to close to only a two-point deficit at 53-51, but Georgetowns defense then made a strong stand. Late in the game, the Hoyas scored seven unanswered points to secure a 78-67 upset win.\nThe Villanova win began a February streak that turned the Hoyas season around; they won eight of their last nine regular-season games. Four days after beating Villanova, they visited St. John's at Madison Square Garden and Page, after missing his first nine shots, scored the game winner as Georgetown prevailed 71-68. After that, Page led the way in Georgetowns late-season surge, scoring 26 points against Syracuse, 26 again four days later against Providence at USAir Arena, 20 at Pittsburgh, 29 at Memphis, 25 against Rutgers, and 28 points against Providence at the Providence Civic Center in the regular-season finale.\nThe victory over Providence gave Georgetown the Big East 7 Division championship for the second year in a row and a No. 2 seed and first-round bye in the 1997 Big East tournament. In the quarterfinals, Page scored 31 points as Georgetown defeated Miami. In the semifinals, Boston Colleges defense held Page to 18 points, and the Eagles beat the Hoyas on their way to winning the tournament championship.\nGeorgetown was the No. 10 seed in the West Region of the 1997 NCAA tournament. In the first round, the Hoyas met No. 7 seed North Carolina-Charlotte. Aw scored a career-high 16 points and pulled down nine rebounds before fouling out, but the 49ers defense held Page to 7-for-22 (31.8%) shooting from the field, and Charlotte won 79-67 to knock Georgetown out of the tournament. Page finished the year averaging 22.7 points per game for the season and 17.1 points per game for his career.\nThe hope that Page would emerge as the next Allen Iverson was dashed in March 1997, when he opted to follow Iversons lead of the year before and break with the Georgetown tradition of playing a full four years, leaving school to enter the NBA draft. During the summer of 1997, Shamel Jones and Jerry Nichols transferred to Memphis and Mississippi Valley State, respectively, and in August 1997 guard Ed Sheffey was dismissed from the team before beginning his sophomore season and transferred to New Mexico State. The breakdown of Georgetown tradition of graduating its players led to criticism of Thompsons recruitment practices, which some observers believed led to the pre-graduation loss of players by signing too many players with troubled backgrounds or without real academic inclination. Thompson responded that he had no apology for recruiting players from poor families if they had talent and did not take into account the likelihood that they would stay for a full four years when he recruited them, adding that he believed that Georgetown University contributed positively to their lives even if they left before graduating.\nThanks to the difficult offseason, the Hoyas would have a depleted roster for the 1997-98 season. Georgetown would not return to the NCAA Tournament until the 2000-01 season. During each of the three intervening seasons, the Hoyas would appear in the National Invitation Tournament instead.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in the AP Poll at any time.

        "title": "Jesús Mora (baseball)",
        "text": "Jesús Mora (born June 9, 1933) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player. He batted and threw right handed. Mora spent ten years in baseball, while playing from 1954 to 1963 for several teams in the Minor Leagues, Mexican Baseball and the Venezuela League. Although he never appeared in a Major League game, Mora teamed with major league figures and earned their respect by doing what he needed to do to win a game.\nA versatile utility man, Mora was able to play all infield positions and in the outfield corners, but he did not hit well. The 5'7\" 157-pound ballplayer posted a career .229 average in four different leagues. Further, while he played 235 games and collected 157 hits and 32 RBI in 687 at bats, he never hit a home run. As a result, he was used mostly by his slick glove and great instincts of the game, especially in the late innings, yet he would achieve notoriety in the final years of his career.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Maracaibo, Zulia; Mora was scouted while playing sandlot ball in his homeland. By the time he also played for a local semi-pro team, being respected in the league as a steady player whom managers could use in almost any position, and for being enthusiastic, positive, and hard working player. He then signed a contract to play in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during the 1954–1955 season.\nProfessional career.\n1954–1957.\nMora was assigned to the Santa Marta BBC, a lousy team managed by former big leaguer Red Kress, which had entered the league as a replacement for the departed Sabios de Vargas. Mora appeared in 21 of the 51 games of the team, batting .250 (5-for-20) with two doubles, two runs and three stolen bases, while playing as a backup infielder, and outfielder for Dave Pope and Joe Frazier. The franchise never reached a high level of popularity, failing to encourage a significant fan support, and would be replaced by the Industriales de Valencia in the 1955–1956 season.\nAfter that Mora played three seasons for Valencia from 1955 to 1956 through 1957–1958. In between, he played briefly for the Leones del Caracas in the 1957–1958 tournament. Throughout this period, he hit .230 (29-for-126) with two triples and nine RBIs, while scoring 13 runs. He also played in 10 postseason games for the Industriales. In the 1957–1958 championship series, he scored a run as a pinch runner. Then, he hit .194 (6-for-32) with one double and two runs in the 1958–1959 first round.\nDuring the same period Mora played for the Havana Sugar Kings of the International League in 1957. By then, the Sugar Kings were the Triple-A affiliate team of the Cincinnati Reds, and played their home games at Gran Stadium in Havana, Cuba. Several talented Latin players who eventually made it to the Major Leagues donned the Sugar Kings uniform, including the Venezuelan infielders Elio Chacón and Pompeyo Davalillo, whom Mora backed up at shortstop and third base, respectively. Mora appeared in 24 games, hitting .250 (12-for-48) with six doubles, six runs, 20 RBIs and two stolen bases.\nCareer highlight.\nMora had his most productive season in the Venezuelan League while playing for the Indios de Oriente in 1957–1958. He batted a career-high .339 with four runs, four RBIs and three stolen bases, as the Indios won the pennant. As the league champions, the team represented Venezuela in the 1959 Caribbean Series played in Caracas. But Mora soon became an unexpected hero, when he hit .417 (10-for-24) in the Series, to tie teammate Camaleón García for the batting title. Mora also posted a .583 slugging average, batted two triples, drove in four runs, and scored four times. Even though the Venezuela's team finished second in the Series, Mora and García made the All-Star team, as did their fellows Babe Birrer and Norm Cash. This was the first time in Caribbean Series history in which four Venezuelan players made the All-Star team in the same year.\n1959–1963.\nA few weeks after his Caribbean Series heroics, Mora joined the Charlotte Hornets of the South Atlantic League in 1959. The Hornets played as a Class-A team in the Washington Senators Minor league system. It was a brief stint for Mora, who collected two hits in 23 at-bats for a .087 average, appearing in just eight games. He then joined the Licoreros de Pampero during the VPBL 1959–1960 season, appearing for them in 27 games, while batting .226 (24-for-106) with four doubles, one triple, 12 runs and seven RBIs.\nMora also saw action with the Diablos Rojos del México of the Mexican League in 1960, but his statistics are incomplete because there are no records available. He returned to Oriente for two VPBL seasons from 1960 to 1962. He averaged .211 (43-for-204) in both seasons, including seven doubles, two triples, 30 runs, nine RBIs and three stolen bases in 72 games.\nMora played his last VPBL season for the 1962–1963 Tiburones de La Guaira. As always, he contributed with his fine glove work, opportune batting and good base running, hitting .220 (22-for-100) with two doubles, 11 runs, two RBIs and two steals in 36 games. This time he also served as fielding and running instructor for the team, nurturing and inspiring future big leaguers as Dámaso Blanco and Luis Salazar, among other rookies.\nLate life.\nAfter retiring at age 30, Mora continued using his baseball experience and life lessons to bring personal growth to young people."

        "text": "The 1941–42 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1941–42 NCAA college basketball season. Elmer Ripley coached it in his sixth of ten seasons as head coach; it was also the fourth season of his second of three stints at the helm. For the second straight year, the team played its home games at Riverside Stadium in Washington, D.C., the last season in which Georgetown played home games there. It played an upgraded national schedule this season and struggled, finishing with a record of 9-11, and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nSenior guard Francis \"Buddy\" O'Grady, who had led the team through challenging seasons the previous two years, had another good season, averaging a career-high 8.8 points per game for the year. Of OGradys departure due to graduation at the end of this season, the Georgetown student yearbook, \"Ye Domesday Book\", wrote, \"In Buddy O'Grady, Georgetown loses one of the greatest basketball players ever to trod on the Ryan Gym [Georgetown's practice facility] floor, and there have been many,\" adding that over his years \"he has undoubtedly been the best basketball player in the District of Columbia.\"\nJunior center Bill Bornheimer, who had starred for Georgetown the previous year, scored 23 points against American in the second game of the season. Opposing teams soon learned to play a defense that contained Bornheimer in the middle, and he only scored in double figures one more time, although his 8.0 point-per-game average was only slightly lower than his 8.4 points per game of the previous season. He also provided a strong defensive presence and was an important rebounder for the team. Georgetown would institute an accelerated graduation program the following season because of World War II, causing him to graduate in January 1943 and making him ineligible for varsity play in 1942–43, so he did not return to the team during his senior year. His 8.2-point-per-game average over his two-year collegiate career, however, was the second-highest career average by a Georgetown player between 1928 and 1942, exceeded only by guard Ed Hargadens 9.8 points-per-game career average between 1932 and 1935.\nThe Hoyas challenging schedule – which included highly regarded teams such as Long Island University, Marquette, and DePaul – and the focus of opponents on limiting Bornheimers scoring opportunities caused the team to struggle to a 9-11 finish. It had no post-season play.\nThe United States entered World War II when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, at the beginning of the season. After the season ended, all but three of the players graduated or left school to enter military service. Ripley thus had to rely on a team nicknamed the \"Kiddie Korps,\" made up mostly of sophomores, the following season.\nRoster.\nSources\nJunior forward Ken Engles left school for military service after this season, but returned to play for the 1945-46 team, and also served as its head coach that season, the only player-coach in Georgetown men's basketball history. Engles was one of two future Georgetown head coaches on the 1941–42 squad; the other was senior guard Buddy O'Grady, who coached the Hoyas from 1949 to 1952.\nSenior guard Don Martin served as head coach at Boston College from 1953 to 1962.\n1941–42 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "Jimmy Dawson (basketball, born 1945)",
        "text": "James C. Dawson (born April 18, 1945 in Oak Park, Illinois) is an American former professional basketball point guard who played one season in the American Basketball Association (ABA) as a member of the Indiana Pacers during the 1967–68 season. He attended University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls during the 16 round of the 1967 NBA draft, but he did not play for them.\nHigh school.\nA native of Oak Park, Illinois, Dawson attended York Community High School from 1959–60 to 1962–63 and led the Dukes to the \"Elite 8\" of the Illinois High School Association state basketball tournament, losing to Jim Burns and the McLeansboro Foxes in the IHSA quarterfinals of the 1962 tournament. In his two state tournament games, Dawson scored 36 points, 18 in the victory versus Harvey (Thornton) and an additional 18 in the loss to McLeansboro. Dawson led York to consecutive regional championships in 1962 and 1963.\nAs a junior Dawson's team would finish the season with an overall record of 25 wins and four losses, and finished in second place in the West Suburban Conference behind Lyons Township High School. As a senior, in 1963, Dawson's team would win the conference as well as win the IHSA regional, with an overall record of 19 wins and seven losses.\nCollege career.\nDawson chose to play college basketball at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and was a member of the freshman basketball team for the 1963–64 season. He played in 70 of the team's 72 games during his three-years on the varsity team and was the starting point guard for all three, replacing Jim Vopicka. As a sophomore during the 1964–65 season, Dawson joined All-American seniors, Tal Brody and future Illini All-Century team member, Skip Thoren, on an Illini team that finished the season with an 18 and 6 record and a third-place finish in the Big Ten with a 10 and four record, losing twice to top-ranked Michigan. During the season the team would win the Kentucky Invitational Tournament and finish the year with a Coaches ranking of number 16.\nThe loss of 999 offensive points occurred with the graduation of Brody and Thoren, leaving Dawson's junior season of 1965–66, needing to find a new identity. The Fighting Illini would struggle all season, losing games by less than three points to Princeton, Providence, Northwestern, Indiana, Michigan State and Minnesota, leaving the team with an overall record of 12 wins and 12 losses and a conference record of 8 wins and 6 losses, placing them tied for third in the conference. This season marked only the second time in Harry Combes tenure that the Illini finished with a .500 record. For Dawson, his best asset was delivering the ball to Donnie Freeman, who would set the all-time single season scoring record of 668 points during the course of the year. After the season, Dawson was named as captain for the following year.\nA dark cloud loomed over Dawson's 1966–67 senior season as an investigation revolving around a \"slush-fund\" program which provided funds to athletes within the basketball and football programs had come to a conclusion. The investigation found that many integral parts of the administration, coaching staff, as well as athletes, were culpable and should be punished. The basketball team was the first to feel the brunt of sanctions caused by the \"slush fund\". For the first few weeks of the season, the team was proving to be one of the elite teams in college basketball. They had defeated Kentucky 98–97 at Memorial Coliseum in early December, a feat the Illini had done only one other time in their history. Prior to the revelations, the team's only loss against West Virginia in Morgantown. Then, just two days before Christmas, while the team awaited its Chicago Stadium game with California, three fifths of the starting lineup were declared ineligible.\nRich Jones, Ron Dunlap and Steve Kuberski never again played for Illinois, and Harry Combes was forced to resign at the end of the season as well as his assistant Howie Braun. Dawson was the only remaining starter and took over the scoring load from that point on, but the real surprise for the remainder of the season was Dave Scholz. Dawson and Scholz combined for 992 points by the season's end and the team would finish in eighth place in the Big Ten with a 6–8 record and a 12–12 record overall. After the season, Dawson would be named an Academic All-American, Most Valuable Player of the team as well as the Big Ten and was awarded the \"Chicago Tribune\"s Silver Basketball.\nProfessional career.\nDawson played one season (1967–1968) in the American Basketball Association (ABA), as a member of the Indiana Pacers. He averaged 5.6 points per game and 1.0 rebounds per game and 1.5 assists per game, in his 21 game career."

        "text": "Kenneth Horton (born July 25, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for Fuenlabrada of the Liga ACB. After going undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft he has played for teams in Cyprus, France, Kazakhstan, Italy, and Mexico.\nCollege career.\nHorton attended Ossining High School in Ossining, New York, before enrolling at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) as a freshman in 2007. In 2007–08, Horton averaged 12.7 points and 5.4 rebounds per game and was named to the All-Northeast Conference (NEC) Rookie Team. He recorded 63 blocks on the season, good for the fourth-most in school history while also becoming the first freshman since 1996–97 to lead the NEC in that category. The following season, Horton was named a Second Team all-conference performer. He led the Blue Devils and was third in the conference with 16.5 points per game while his 5.8 rebounds also topped his team. Due to an injury, he was forced to redshirt (sit out) his junior year in 2009–10.\nWhen Horton returned as a redshirt junior in 2010–11, he proved himself to be the class of the Northeast Conference. He led the league in scoring at 19.5 points per outing, was third in rebounding with 8.9 per game, scored 20+ points 14 times and 30+ points on four occasions. He also led the NEC in double-doubles (12) and accumulated five NEC Player of the Week awards, more than any other player that season. He was named the Northeast Conference Player of the Year, becoming the fifth Blue Devil all-time to earn the award. The Associated Press also named him as an Honorable Mention All-American.\nAlthough Horton's senior season in 2011–12 was statistically comparable to his breakout junior season (19.0 points, 8.9 rebounds per game), he failed to repeat as the conference's player of the year. He did finish his collegiate career, however, as Central Connecticut's all-time men's basketball leading scorer with 1,966 career points.\nProfessional career.\nHorton was invited to participate in the 2012 Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, an annual event that showcases 64 of the top graduating seniors across the country for NBA scouts. However, he did not get selected in that year's NBA draft. Horton then began to pursue his professional career overseas. His first stop was in France for Stade Olympique Maritime Boulonnais, followed by Cyprus' Apollon Limassol. In the 2013–14 season he played for Huracanes de Tampico in Mexico and for the 2014–15 season he signed with the Finnish club Kataja Basket.\nHorton played for Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez in France in the 2017–18 season, during which time he averaged 11.9 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. On September 5, 2018, he signed with Astana of the Kazakhstan Championship.\nOn June 24, 2019, he signed a 1-year deal with Germani Basket Brescia of the LBA. Horton averaged 11 points and 5 rebounds per game. On August 6, 2020, he signed with San Pablo Burgos of the Liga ACB. With Burgos, he won the 2019–20 Basketball Champions League.\nHorton has also played for Beirut Club in Lebanon until February 22, 2023, when he signed with Fuenlabrada of the Liga ACB."

        "text": "The 1937–38 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1937–38 NCAA college basketball season. Fred Mesmer coached it in his seventh and final season as head coach. The team was a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (EIC) and played its home games at Tech Gymnasium on the campus of McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C. The team finished with a record of 7–11 overall, 5–5 in the EIC, and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nSenior Harry Bassin was lead forward for the team and averaged 6.8 points per game. In the last game of his collegiate career, the season finale at Yale, he scored a career-high 16 points in Georgetowns overtime loss.\nJunior forward Joe Murphy scored 18 points at Madison Square Garden against New York University and led the team in scoring. He finished the season averaging 7.8 points per game.\nSenior forward Mike Petrosky was the teams second leading scorer, with only three fewer points for the season than Murphy, and averaged a career-high 7.7 points per game. He was also among the best rebounders, although rebounds were not yet recorded as a game or career statistic.\nDuring conference play, Georgetown finished with a 5–5 record and was the only team to defeat Temple. Temple finished the season at 9–1 in conference play, 23–2 overall, and went on to win the 1938 National Invitation Tournament. Overall, the Hoyas finished with a 7–11 record and had no postseason play.\nWhen Elmer Ripley, who had served as Georgetowns head coach from 1927 to 1929 during Mesmers time as a Georgetown player, expressed interest in returning to Georgetown for a second tour of duty coaching the Hoyas, Mesmer stepped aside at the end of the season to allow Ripley to take over the program the following year. Mesmer had coached Georgetown for seven seasons with an overall record of 53–76, that record partly reflecting the universitys reduced emphasis on sports during his coaching years. Although his teams had gone 36–20 (.643) at home, they had managed only a 17–56 (.233) record on the road, and this had led to only two winning seasons during his tenure. Despite this, he was a popular figure in Georgetown sports throughout his time both as a player and as head coach.\nRoster.\nSources\nSenior guard Tom Nolan would go on to serve as Georgetowns head basketball coach from 1956 to 1960, and as the schools baseball coach until the end of the 1978 season.\nSophomore guard Francis \"Reds\" Daly was killed in action in the Battle of Iwo Jima on February 22, 1945, during World War II military service.\n1937–38 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

The first player to achieve the feat was Juul Ellerman, who scored three times for PSV Eindhoven in a 6–0 victory over Žalgiris on 16 September 1992. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored three or more goals in a match eight times each in the Champions League, more than any other player, followed by Robert Lewandowski with six, and Karim Benzema with four.\nSeventeen players have scored four or more goals in a match; of these, only Messi and Lewandowski have achieved this more than once. Only Messi (on 8 March 2012 against Bayer Leverkusen), Luiz Adriano (on 21 October 2014 against BATE Borisov) and Erling Haaland (on 14 March 2023 against RB Leipzig) have scored five goals in a match. Only Ronaldo (four times), Messi, Lewandowski and Benzema (twice each) have scored multiple hat-tricks in the knockout stage. Only Lewandowski has scored a hat-trick for three clubs (Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona), with a further twelve players having scored hat-tricks for two clubs. \nTen players have scored a hat-trick on their competition debut: Marco van Basten, Faustino Asprilla, Yakubu, Wayne Rooney, Vincenzo Iaquinta, Grafite, Yacine Brahimi, Erling Haaland, Mislav Oršić, and Sébastien Haller; of those, only van Basten and Haller scored four goals. Seven players have scored hat-tricks in consecutive seasons: Adriano (2004–05 and 2005–06), Mario Gómez (2010–11 and 2011–12), Roberto Soldado (2011–12 and 2012–13), Ronaldo (2012–13 and 2013–14, and 2015–16 and 2016–17), Messi (2013–14 and 2014–15), Gabriel Jesus (2018–19 and 2019–20), Kylian Mbappé (2019–20 and 2020–21), and Lewandowski (2021–22 and 2022–23). Three players have scored hat-tricks in back-to-back games. Ronaldo, during his tenure with Real Madrid, netted hat-tricks against Bayern Munich on 18 April and Atlético Madrid on 2 May 2017, the shortest gap between hat-tricks at just 14 days. Luiz Adriano accomplished this feat for Shakhtar Donetsk on 21 October and 5 November 2014, with both hat-tricks coming against BATE Borisov in a span of 15 days. Benzema scored a hat-trick for Real against Paris Saint-Germain on 9 March 2022, and against Chelsea on 6 April. Ronaldo is the only player to score three hat-tricks in the same season, doing so during the 2015–16 season; he also scored two in the 2016–17. Five other players have scored multiple hat-tricks in the same season: Messi for Barcelona in both 2011–12 and 2016–17, Gómez for Bayern, also in 2011–12, Luiz Adriano for Shakhtar in 2013–14, Lewandowski for Bayern in 2021–22, and Benzema for Real in the same season.\nMohamed Salah holds the record for the quickest hat-trick, netting three times for Liverpool against Rangers in six minutes and twelve seconds on 12 October 2022. Only six players have scored a hat-trick after coming on as a substitute: Uwe Rösler (Kaiserslautern), Joseba Llorente (Villarreal), Walter Pandiani (Deportivo La Coruña), Mbappé (PSG), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), and Salah (Liverpool). The youngest scorer of a hat-trick is Raúl, who scored a hat-trick for Real against Ferencváros, aged 18 years and 114 days, on 18 October 1995. Rooney is the youngest debut scorer of a hat-trick, aged 18 years and 340 days, when he scored for Manchester United against Fenerbahçe on 28 September 2004. The oldest scorer of a hat-trick is Benzema, who was 34 years and 108 days old when he scored three against Chelsea on 6 April 2022. The longest spell between two hat-tricks was achieved by Owen, who scored his first hat-trick on 22 October 2002 for Liverpool and his second over seven years later, on 8 December 2009 for United.\nTen hat-tricks were scored in the 2019–20 season, the most of any season in the Champions League history, while none were scored in the 1994–95 and 2001–02 editions.\nHat-tricks.\nThe \"Result\" column shows the player's team's score first.\nMultiple hat-tricks.\nThe following table lists the number of hat-tricks scored by players who have scored two or more hat-tricks.

It finished with a record of 9-15 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nSenior guard Tommy O'Keefe and senior forward Ray Corley were the stars of the team. O'Keefe was the team's top scorer for a second straight season, with a season high of 22 points in the game against the New York Athletic Club.\nThe 1948-49 squad started 6-3, but then lost 12 of its last 15 games to finish with a record of 9-15 – the least successful team in Ripleys ten Georgetown seasons – and had no post-season play. It was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll – conducted for the first time this season – at any time.\nConsidered a legend in basketball, Ripley departed at the end of the season, having coached the Hoyas in three separate stints (1927-1929, 1938-1943, and 1946-1949) with an overall record of 133-82, including what was then the schools only appearance in a postseason tournament when the 1942-43 team advanced to the final game of the 1943 NCAA Tournament. He was head coach of John Carroll from 1949 to 1951, Army from 1951 to 1953, the Harlem Globetrotters from 1953 to 1956, the Israeli Olympic basketball team in 1956, and the Canadian Olympic basketball team in 1960.\nRoster.\nSources\nSenior guard Tommy O'Keefe would later serve as Georgetowns assistant coach for four seasons from 1956 to 1960 and as head coach for six seasons from 1960 to 1966.\n1948–49 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the games played against a United States Army team from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and the New York Athletic Club therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1948-49. It was not until 1952 after the completion of the 1951-52 season that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "Thirty-three individuals who played professional baseball at the major league level before 1900 lack identified given names (there are hundreds of other players of which this is true from the twentieth-century Negro leagues). All 33 played between 1872 and 1892; 18 played in the National Association, which folded in 1875. Identification of players remains difficult due to a lack of biographical information. A Brooklyn, New York, directory, for instance, lists more than 30 men who could be the professional player \"Stoddard\". Philadelphia Athletics manager Bill Sharsig signed three of the 32, \"local players\" McBride, Stafford and Sweigert, for Philadelphia's last game of the season against the Syracuse Stars on October 12, 1890. McBride, Philadelphia's center fielder, and Stafford, the team's right fielder, both failed to reach base, but left fielder Sweigert reached base on a walk and stole a base. Society for American Baseball Research writer Bill Carle \"doubt[s] we will ever be able to identify them\". David Nemec has commented on this phenomenon with both major league and minor league players, noting, for example, that a McGuire (not on this list because he was a minor league player) is probably the player with an unknown first name whose appearances came closest to the twentieth century.\nDespite their relative anonymity, several of these players received media coverage describing their games. In 1872, \"The New York Times\" described O'Rourke as a new player on Eckford of Brooklyn who \"appear[ed] to be an improvement over the recent incumbents\": in his only game, the pitcher allowed 15 runs to score in a complete game against the Troy Trojans. Lewis received a mention in \"Sporting Life\" \"(pictured)\" that recapped his performance, and another in the \"Pittsburgh Press\", with a synopsis that summarized the game as \"one of the greatest slugging matches ever seen since curve pitching came into vogue\". \nOf the 33 athletes with an unidentified given name, Baltimore Monumentals right fielder Scott played in the most games at the major league level, with 13, followed by Wills with 9. Scott also has the most hits among players without an identified given name, with 12, followed by both Wills and Jones with 5 each. Among pitchers, Lewis has the highest earned run average, 60.00, whereas McDoolan has the lowest, 3.00."

Elmer Ripley coached it in his ninth season as head coach, the second season of his third stint at the helm. The team was an independent and for the first time played its home games at the D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 13-15 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1946–47 team had won 19 games, and all five of its starters returned this year, including forward Andy Kostecka, a star of the 1942–43 team and – after World War II military service – of the 1946–47 team. Hopes were high that the 1947–48 squad would take the Hoyas back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1943, when Ripley had coached them to the national final in their only tournament appearance thus far. The team won its first six games, with Kostecka averaging 22 points per game during the first four, one of which was an overtime win over St. John's at Madison Square Garden in New York City - Georgetowns only win over the Redmen in 17 games played between 1931 and 1973. Kostecka suffered a leg injury in the fifth game, against Virginia Tech, and missed the sixth and seventh games of the season.\nAfter a 6–1 start, the Hoyas embarked on a road trip on December 24, 1947, that took them to six games spread across Louisiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. The trip was controversial because of its length, the tight schedule of games – including four games in five nights requiring 300 miles (483 km) of travel – and the requirement for the players to be on the road during Christmas, but Ripley believed that it would allow the Georgetown program to gain national recognition by playing Louisville, Notre Dame, and Saint Louis. The trip, which lasted through January 5, 1948, wore the players down; Kostecka, for example, had averaged 17 points per game before the trip but managed only half that during it, although his 11 points against Notre Dame in the last game of the trip made him Georgetowns top scorer in history. Georgetown lost all six games to fall to 6–7 on the season. Following the trip, the \"Washington Times-Herald\" newspaper reported dissension between Ripley and Kostecka over the trip; both denied it, but Kostecka was dismissed from the team after the article appeared.\nWith top scorer Kostecka off the team, Georgetown struggled through its next 10 games in a tough national schedule, winning only three of them. Senior guard Dan Kraus, like Kostecka a star of the successful 1942–43 and 1946–47 teams, had been a defensive specialist during his career, but he stepped into the breach on offense, scoring 14 against New York University, 12 at Penn State, and 13 at Villanova. Junior guard Tommy O'Keefe scored 50 points over one three-game stretch and in double figures nine times, including 14 against Penn State and 20 against George Washington, and ended the season as the Hoyas leading scorer. Falling to 9–14 with five games to play, Georgetown managed to win four of the remaining games to finish with a record of 13–15. The teams disappointing final record meant no post-season play.\nThe unremarkable 1947–48 season heralded the beginning of a mostly undistinguished quarter-century of men's basketball at Georgetown. Although the team would appear in the National Invitation Tournament in 1953 and 1970, between the 1947–48 season and the end of the 1971–72 season, Georgetown would have an overall record under .500, and its total of 296 wins during those 25 seasons would be the lowest among the 32 Catholic universities playing Division I college basketball in the United States. It would have no NCAA tournament appearances during these seasons; in fact, after appearing in the NCAA tournament in 1943, it would not make the tournament again until 1975.\nRoster.\nSources\nJunior guard Tommy O'Keefe would later serve as Georgetowns assistant coach for four seasons from 1956 to 1960 and as head coach for six seasons from 1960 to 1966.\n1947–48 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the game played against a United States Marine Corps team from Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on December 16, 1947, therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1947–48. It was not until 1952 after the completion of the 1951–52 season that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "A total of seven bids were initially submitted for the 2026 Winter Olympics. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn after entering the candidature stage, leaving Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy and Stockholm–Åre, Sweden as the only two remaining candidate bids. Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo was elected as the host city at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 June 2019.\nBidding process.\nThe IOC Executive Board met in Lausanne to discuss the 2026 bidding process on 9 June 2017; and a new approach was approved at the Extraordinary IOC Session on 11–12 July 2017. The IOC will take a more proactive role in assisting and supporting cities considering a candidature for the 2026 Olympics, and will customise its approach to the needs of the cities in order for them to develop the best value proposition. These measures will lead to a simplified process for the cities, with reduced costs. The Invitation Phase has been extended to one year, starting 13 September 2017, and the Candidature Phase has been shortened to one year, starting from 2018 to 2019. These measures were enacted due to a lack of interest in bidding for the 2026 Games well into 2017.\nIOC's 2026 Evaluation Commission.\nIn October 2018, the IOC appointed the following members and stakeholder representatives to the Evaluation Commission that will assess the candidate cities for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nMilan–Cortina d'Ampezzo was selected as host city of the 2026 Winter Olympics after beating Stockholm–Åre by 13 votes on 24 June 2019 at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. The host city was originally due to be selected on 11 September 2019, at the 134th IOC Session in Milan; however, IOC rules required that the election be moved to a different location after Italy submitted a bid for the 2026 Games that included the city.\nFinal selection process.\nThe IOC voted to select the host city of the 2026 Winter Olympics on 24 June 2019 at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nCriteria.\nA firm criterion for the Winter Olympics is the availability of alpine ski slopes of certain sizes, which narrows down potential locations significantly, and often necessitates locations in less populated areas. The men's downhill requires at least altitude difference along a course of around in length.\nFor the 2026 Winter Olympics the IOC allowed a longer distance between events, so that alpine skiing can be held in a mountain area, and sports such as ice hockey and figure skating can be held in a large city more than away where such arenas are already available or have greater usage after the games.\nA certain spectator capacity is required, which is most often 10,000 but varies according to the particular sport. Furthermore, certain VIP areas are required at every venue.\nCandidate cities.\nOn 2 July 2018, the IOC announced that it would contribute US$925 million to the host city in order to help reduce costs.\nCities in dialogue stage.\nThe following cities participated in the dialogue stage. Four of these (Calgary, Sapporo, Sion, and Stockholm) joined the dialogue stage at its launch on 29 September 2017, and took part in the PyeongChang 2018 Observer Programme. The other cities joined in time for the deadline (31 March 2018) for entering the candidature stage.\nCities in candidature stage.\nThree of the four cities that still remained in the dialogue stage in October 2018 were invited by the IOC to join the candidature stage; these were Calgary, Stockholm, and the joint Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo bid. Erzurum was the only city remaining in the dialogue stage that was not invited to advance. Calgary withdrew its bid on 19 November 2018, and Stockholm created a joint bid with Åre on 11 January 2019 to become Stockholm–Åre 2026.\nThe candidate cities were required to fulfill their governmental requirements by 11 January 2019.\nWithdrawn from dialogue stage.\nThe following cities were seen as potential bids and took part in the dialogue stage, but have withdrawn for various reasons.\nPreviously interested in bidding.\nThe following cities initially explored the possibility of bidding but decided not to proceed to the dialogue stage."

        "title": "1994–95 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1994–95 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1994–95 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 23rd season as head coach. They played their home games at USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 21-10, 11-7 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1995 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the tournament semifinal before losing to Connecticut. They were awarded a No. 6 seed in the Southeast Region of the 1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – Georgetowns 16th NCAA Tournament appearance in 17 years – and advanced to the Southeast Region Semifinals before losing to regions No. 2 seed, North Carolina. They were ranked No. 22 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No 16 in the postseason Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetowns transition from relying on feeding the ball to a \"big man\" at center to playing an uptempo offense focused on play by the guards continued this year. Senior George Butler had transferred to Georgetown from Tyler Junior College the previous season for his junior year to fill a gap at shooting guard that had hurt the Hoyas in 1992-93 and begin the transition. This season, Allen Iverson joined Butler in the backcourt.\nIverson had been a stand-out in high school, but had been arrested and sentenced to prison for his supposed participation in a February 1993 fight in a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia. Available evidence in the case ranged from doubtful to strongly suggesting his innocence, and his conviction and sentencing were racially charged. Most colleges and universities abandoned any plans they might have had to recruit Iverson. John Thompson had had a tendency over the years to pass on recruiting troubled players, but he responded to an appeal by Iversons mother to give Iverson a chance to attend college by agreeing to sign him if he finished high school and if his legal problems were resolved. Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder granted Iverson clemency and Iverson completed high school in time to participate in Georgetown's Jacob Kenner League, a summer basketball league for Georgetown and other Washington, D.C.-area college players played at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus, in 1994. On August 4, 1994, in his first game since his February 1993 arrest, he debuted with a 40-point performance, and by the end of the last of three Kenner League games on August 7 he had scored 99 points against some of the areas best college players. In an exhibition game the Hoyas played at McDonough in November 1994 against the Fort Hood Tankers, a United States Army team from Fort Hood, Texas, Iverson electrified the crowd with 36 points, five assists, and three steals in 23 minutes of play, shooting 19-for-21 (90.5%) from the free-throw line; by the time he reached 24 points in the game, he had scored as many points as the entire Fort Hood team. In the second and final exhibition game of the preseason, he scored 39 points against Croatia and again appeared 21 times at the free-throw line.\nIversons legal troubles and obvious athletic talent focused national attention on him, and he debuted in the regular season with a 19-point game against No. 1-ranked Arkansas in the season opener. Six days later he had 31 points against DePaul, and four days after that he scored 30 points against Providence. He led the team in scoring 22 times and scored in double figures in all but one game, the exception being at Villanova in a game in which he played only ten minutes and Thompson threatened to pull the Hoyas off the court and forfeit after Villanova students mocked Iverson by marching around the arena wearing black-and-white-striped prison uniforms and carrying a sign comparing Iverson to former American football great O. J. Simpson, then under arrest and awaiting trial for murder. After the game, Thompson told the press that the prison taunt was too offensive to tolerate and that he would not hesitate to pull his team off the court if anything like it ever occurred again, and such fan behavior did not recur.\nIverson never scored in less than double figures again in his two-year collegiate career. With President Bill Clinton looking on, he had 26 points in a rematch with ninth-ranked Villanova at USAir Arena in which the Hoyas scored the games first 11 points, forced 23 Villanova turnovers, had 16 steals, and upset the Wildcats 77-52 on national television. Iverson later had 21 points against Syracuse and 28 points against St. John's. He finished the year averaging 20.4 points per game, second highest in Georgetown history for a first-year varsity player, despite shooting only 39 percent from the field, 23 percent from three-point range, and 19 percent in three-point shots during Big East play.\nFellow guard George Butler also began the season with high-scoring performances, his best of the year being 15 points against Memphis at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in Georgetowns only regular-season game ever played outside the United States and its territories prior to the opening game of the 2013-14 season. On January 7, 1995, however, he did not suit up for the days game against Miami at USAir Arena, and Thompson announced after the game that he had been dismissed from the team for academic reasons. He left the team averaging 11.2 points per game for the year. In his one-and-a-half-season, 40-game Georgetown career, he had averaged 13.3 points per game.\nJunior center Othella Harringtons role already had diminished the previous season with Thompsons deemphasis of the center in Georgetowns offense in favor of uptempo guard play provided by Butler, and his performance declined further this season with the arrival of Iverson. He nonetheless contributed to Georgetowns scoring, notably with 27 points against 17th-ranked Syracuse in a game at the Carrier Dome in which the Hoyas came back from a 14-point deficit to upset the Orangemen. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in his least successful season, but would enjoy a resurgence the following year.\nJunior forward Jerome Williams arrived as a transfer after two years playing for Montgomery College in Montgomery County, Maryland. He started all 31 games and immediately emerged as a top rebounder for the Hoyas, collecting 65 in the first five games, and averaging 31 minutes and 10 rebounds per game for the year. Displaying great defensive prowess, he scored 15 points and had 17 rebounds against DePaul, scored 17 and pulled down 15 rebounds versus Pittsburgh, and scored 11 points and grabbed 14 rebounds versus Connecticut. In the final two games of the regular season, against Seton Hall at USAir Arena and at Madison Square Garden against St. Johns, he scored a combined 47 points and had 28 rebounds. He finished the year averaging 10.9 points and 10.0 rebounds a game for the season, becoming the first Georgetown forward to lead the team in rebounding since Reggie Williams.\nSenior center and team captain Don Reid led the team in scoring once with a 21-point performance against Morgan State in the second game of the season, and he averaged 7.2 points and 5.7 rebounds a game for the year. Freshman forward Boubacar Aw, meanwhile, played in 30 games, all in a reserve role. He played particularly well against Connecticut late in the year, averaging 15.5 points and five rebounds per game in the final regular-season game against the Huskies and 1995 Big East tournament semifinal game combined.\nIn the Big East tournament, Georgetown had a bye in the first round and defeated Miami in the quarterfinals behind a 31-point performance by Iverson, who outscored the entire Miami team during the first half. In the semifinals, Connecticut defeated the Hoyas, but Iverson scored 27 points.\nGeorgetown was the No. 6 seed in the Southeast Region of the 1995 NCAA tournament, and defeated Xavier in the first round. In the second round, Georgetown faced Weber State. The Hoyas had not advanced beyond the second round of the NCAA tournament since the 1988-89 season, losing to its second-round opponent all four times it had gone to the tournament over that span. It looked as though the Hoyas would repeat the pattern when they fouled Weber States leading scorer, guard Ruben Nembhard, with the score tied 51-51 and eight seconds left in the game. Nembhard missed his first free throw, however, and Iverson sped down the court to put up a shot for the win. It missed, but Reid grabbed the rebound and scored on a layup as time expired to win the game 53-51 in perhaps the highlight of the year. It was Georgetowns first last-second win since 1988, and Thompson was seen performing a courtside victory dance as his players celebrated.\nThe win allowed Georgetown to advance to meet the Southeast Regions No. 2 seed, 4th-ranked North Carolina, in the regions semifinals. Iverson scored 24 points against the Tar Heels and held North Carolinas sophomore guard Jeff McInnis to a 1-for-8 (12.5%) shooting performance from the field, but North Carolina prevailed to knock Georgetown out of the tournament and bring the Hoyas season to an end.\nGeorgetowns December 3, 1994, victory over DePaul began a 14-game Hoya winning streak against the Blue Demons over the next 20 years. DePaul would not finally break the streak until the Blue Demons upset the Hoyas in the first round of the 2014 Big East tournament in March 2014.\nRoster.\nSophomore reserve guard Brendan Gaughan later became a successful NASCAR driver.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1994–95 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

It has been broken in every decade since the sport became professional around the start of the 20th century. Between the 1930s and 1980s, international transfer bans were imposed, removed and renewed at different times due to the sport's governing bodies' fears of excessive talent drain overseas. In 1998, the sport's transfer system was changed to allow any player aged 24 or over to move between clubs at the end of their contract without a fee being paid. As a result, transfer fees in rugby league became much more uncommon. The current record fee paid is , paid by the New Zealand Warriors to the Wigan Warriors in 2013 for Sam Tomkins."

        "title": "2014 Rafael Nadal tennis season",
        "text": "The 2014 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 30 December 2013 with the start of the 2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open. This season saw Nadal suffer from injuries that included a back injury, a wrist injury, and appendicitis. After losing in the final of the Australian Open where he suffered from a back injury, Nadal failed to defend his titles at Indian Wells, Barcelona, and Rome. He rebounded by claiming his 9th French Open. Prior to the North American hardcourt season, Nadal would experience another injury, this time a wrist injury which forced him to withdraw from the Rogers Cup, the Western &amp; Southern Open and the US Open where he was the defending champion. Nadal announced on 24 October that he would not be competing for rest of the season due to appendicitis and eventually underwent surgery. Despite an injury plagued season, Nadal still ended the year at No. 3 with four titles.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nQatar Open.\nRafael Nadal won the title at 2014 Qatar Open after defeating Gaël Monfils in the final on January 4.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal reached his third final Down Under by dispatching his old rival Roger Federer in the semi-finals with a straight set victory and by dropping only one set on the way, against Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals. Victory in the final would have seen Nadal equal Pete Sampras's total of 14 major titles and also become only the third man to win all four grand slams at least twice, Roy Emerson and Rod Laver being the other two. In the final, though, he was unexpectedly beaten by Stanislas Wawrinka, who had previously never beaten Nadal or even won a set against him in 12 previous meetings. At a set and a break down, Nadal sustained a back injury that saw him swiftly lose the second set. He recovered enough to win the third and fought hard before Wawrinka prevailed in four sets.\nRio Open.\nNadal won the inaugural Rio Open after beating Alexandr Dolgopolov in the final on February 23. In the semifinal a day earlier, he had to save two match points in the 3rd set tie breaker to win against Pablo Andújar.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nNadal next competed in the Indian Wells Masters. He received a bye in the first round and fought back from a set down to overcome Radek Štěpánek in the second round. His tournament ended in the next round, though, as Alexandr Dolgopolov exacted a measure of revenge for his Rio Open final loss by dispatching Nadal in a third set tie break.\nMiami Masters.\nAfter not competing in 2013, Nadal returned to Key Biscane for a chance at his first Miami Masters title. He dominated his first three opponents, losing a total of nine games combined. He then fought back from a set down to overcome Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals. In an unprecedented event both Novak Djokovic and he received walkovers from their semi-final opponents to set up their 40th clash. It was Nadal's fourth Miami final, following runner-up finishes in 2005, 2008, and 2011. Nadal would once again fail to lift the trophy, though, as Djokovic displayed near perfect form and eased his way to a two-set victory.\nSpring clay court season and French Open.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nAfter finally relinquishing his Monte-Carlo crown to Novak Djokovic in 2013, Nadal returned to the red clay in an attempt to reclaim the title that had been his from 2005 to 2012. As expected the King of Clay won his first two matches with ease. His victory against Andreas Seppi in the third round brought his career clay court wins to 300, a feat achieved by only ten other players. In the quarter-finals, though, Nadal would succumb to the relentless attack of David Ferrer. It was the first time Ferrer had beaten Nadal on clay in ten years and the first time Nadal failed to reach the Monte-Carlo final since his first stint in the tournament as a qualifier in 2003.\nBarcelona Open.\nNadal hadn't lost a match at the Barcelona Open since 2003 and hadn't lost a set at the tournament since dropping one against David Ferrer in the 2008 final. These streaks seemed destined to continue and did against his first two opponents, both of whom he dispatched in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Nadal's set streak ended at 44 when Nicolás Almagro took the second set of their match in a tight tiebreak. Almagro would also put an end to Nadal's win streak at 41 when he clinched the match by winning the third set as well.\nMadrid Open.\nNadal claimed his fourth Madrid Open crown (third on clay) by defeating Kei Nishikori in the final. Nadal was down a set and a break in the final when Nishikori began showing signs of injury. This injury aided Nadal as he fought back to win the second set and take a three-game lead in the third before Nishikori retired.\nItalian Open.\nNadal made his ninth final at the Italian Open and was vying for his eighth title, but was beaten in three sets by his rival Novak Djokovic in the final. In the second round, Nadal played the longest three set match of the year (thus far) by battling Gilles Simon for 199 minutes. In the third round and quarter-final, he was forced to rally from a set down to claim victory against Mikhail Youzhny and Andy Murray respectively. His loss marked the first time in ten years that he would enter into the French Open with fewer than two European clay court titles.\nFrench Open.\nDespite a sub-par European clay court season, Nadal entered the second Major of the year with a 59–1 record at the event. By the end of the tournament Nadal would extend this record to 66–1 by claiming his record fifth consecutive and record ninth French Open title with a four set victory over Novak Djokovic. He won his first four rounds against Robby Ginepri, Dominic Thiem, Leonardo Mayer, and Dušan Lajović, respectively, without dropping a set. In the quarter-finals, he faced last year's finalist, David Ferrer. He dropped the opening set, his first of the tournament, but went on to win in four sets. In the semi-finals, he put on a devastating display and lost only six games as he dispatched Andy Murray in straight sets. The final was a rematch of last year's semifinal and the 2012 final as well as his 42nd match against Novak Djokovic. In winning his 9th Roland Garros title, Nadal became the only player to have won one Grand Slam for ten consecutive years.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nHalle Open.\nNadal received a bye in the first round and then lost to Dustin Brown in the second round. The loss marked Nadal's third consecutive defeat on grass and dropped his record on the surface to 2–5 since he reached the 2011 Wimbledon final.\nWimbledon.\nHaving been bounced in the second round by Lukáš Rosol in 2012, the first round by Steve Darcis in 2013, and riding a three match grass losing streak, Nadal entered the 2014 edition of Wimbledon looking for redemption. His first match started off rocky as he dropped the opening set against Martin Kližan, but he recovered to win in four and snap his losing streak. Up next was his 2012 conqueror, Rosol. Rosol looked capable of pulling out the upset once again as he led by a set and a break, but Nadal righted the ship and got revenge for his 2012 defeat by pulling the match out in four. Nadal again recovered from a set down against Mikhail Kukushkin in the third round, marking the first time in his career that he won three consecutive matches after dropping the first set. Nadal went on to face 19-year-old wildcard Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round and once again dropped the opening set, but was unable to recover this time and succumbed to Kyrgios in four sets. It was Nadal's first defeat to a player born in the 1990s and the first time a teenager had beaten the World No. 1 at a Grand Slam since Nadal himself beat Roger Federer at the 2005 French Open.\nSummer hard court season.\nCanadian Open, Cincinnati Masters, and US Open.\nNadal was the defending champion of all three tournaments, but had to withdraw from each because he was unable to recover from a right wrist injury that he suffered while practicing on July 29.\nAsian Swing.\nChina Open.\nNadal returned to action from his wrist injury after three months away from the tour with a dominant two set victory over Richard Gasquet. He won the next round as well, but rust and lack of training became apparent as he fell to Martin Kližan in the quarters.\nShanghai Masters.\nBefore his opening match, Nadal announced that he had been receiving aggressive medical treatment for appendicitis in hopes of avoiding surgery until the end of the tennis season. The effects of this ailment, though, could be seen in his movement and play in his opening match as Feliciano López handed him a straight set defeat.\nIndoor hard court season and World Tour Finals.\nSwiss indoors.\nNadal seemed to be back to his winning ways as he easily dispatched his first two opponents. In the quarter-finals, though, he ran into red hot 17-year-old Borna Ćorić and was beaten in straight sets.\nParis Masters and ATP World Tour Finals.\nAfter his defeat in Basel, Nadal announced that he was not in a condition to be able to compete at the level necessary to win and opted out of both the Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals to have surgery for his appendicitis. It was the third time that Nadal was forced to withdraw from the ATP World Tour Finals after he had qualified.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nNadal's 2014 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\n1 The symbol (i) = \"indoors\" means that the respective tournament will be held indoors.\n2 The ATP numbers between brackets = non-countable tournaments.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins, then ranking at the time of the most recent match.\"\n Pablo Andújar"

        "text": "The Slovenia men's national volleyball team represents Slovenia in international volleyball competitions and friendly matches, and is governed by the Volleyball Federation of Slovenia. The team made its debut at major tournaments in 2001, when it competed at the European Volleyball Championship. Between 2015 and 2021, Slovenia reached the final of the European Championship three times and finished as runners-up on all three occasions after losing to France, Serbia and Italy, respectively.\nAs of December 2023, Slovenia is ranked 7th in the FIVB World Rankings.\nHistory.\nThe Slovenia national team played its first official match on 24 April 1992, under the leadership of Viktor Krevsel. They make their first appearance at the European Volleyball Championship in 2001, where they finished in 12th place.\nIn March 2015, Andrea Giani was announced as new head coach of the Slovenian national team. In October 2015, Slovenia won its first medal at the 2015 European Volleyball Championships after losing in the final against France (3–0). Tine Urnaut won one of the individual player awards for the best outside spiker.\nIn January 2017, Giani resigned as coach, and in March 2017, Slobodan Kovač took over the team. In May 2017, Slovenia qualified for the 2018 edition of the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, their first ever World Championship appearance.\nIn January 2019, the Volleyball Federation of Slovenia and Kovač both agreed to part ways and terminate the contract. He was replaced by Alberto Giuliani. In 2019, Slovenia hosted the 2019 edition of the FIVB Volleyball Men's Challenger Cup at home in Ljubljana. The team reached the final, where they defeated Cuba 3–0 and earned the right to participate in the 2020 Nations League, replacing Portugal; however, the competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Slovenia qualified for the 2021 edition instead. At their Nations League debut in Rimini, Italy, the team reached the final round as the only challenger team, where they lost 3–0 both to Poland and France in the semifinals and in the third place match, respectively.\nAt the 2019 European Championship, Slovenia was one of the four co-hosts of the tournament. The team reached the final again, where they lost 3–1 to Serbia, clinching their second silver medal in four years. Two years later, at the 2021 European Championship, Slovenia once again reached the final. After defeating hosts Poland in the semifinals, they lost the final 3–2 to Italy to claim their third silver medal. Gregor Ropret was selected in the All Star Team as the best setter through fan votes. Giuliani decided to step down as Slovenia head coach in September 2021, and was replaced by Mark Lebedew from February 2022. After failing to reach the top 8 in the 2022 Nations League, he was sacked and replaced by Gheorghe Crețu in August 2022, just two weeks before the start of the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, hosted by Slovenia and Poland.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is Slovenia's roster for the 2024 FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League.\nHead coach: Gheorghe Crețu\nCompetitive record.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   As host"

        "text": "The 1950–51 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1950–51 NCAA college basketball season. Francis \"Buddy\" O'Grady coached it in his second season as head coach. The team was an independent and moved to Uline Arena in Washington, D.C., for its home games this season. It finished with a record of 8-14 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1950–51 team was a youthful one, with a roster that included only one senior and four juniors, the other ten players being sophomores. Seven of those sophomores had arrived on the varsity team from a freshman team that had had great success the previous year, posting a 16-1 record.\nSophomore center Bill Bolger was among the new arrivals. Playing in all 22 games, he scored 20 or more points in five of the final 11 games of the season, averaging 12.7 points per game for the year.\nAnother standout sophomore was guard Barry Sullivan, who debuted in the first game of the season with 22 points against Geneva. He followed that by scoring in double figures in 16 of the next 17 games, including 25 points against Long Island and another 25-point performance against American in the next game five days later. He missed the last four games of the season due to illness, but averaged a team-leading 16.1 points per game for the season.\nSophomore center Hugh Beins scored in double figures in seven of eight games at midseason and had a season-high 19 points against Mount St. Mary's. His performance tailed off later in the season, but he would return for two more years as one of the top players in Georgetown history.\nThe young and inexperienced team started with an 8-6 record but ended the season with an eight-game losing streak that gave it a final record of 8-14. It had no post-season play and was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or in the Top 30 in the Coaches' Poll – which began this season – at any time.\nNo Georgetown men's basketball team had played its home games on campus since the 1926-27 team had used Ryan Gymnasium as its home court, but the 1950–51 squad was the last Georgetown men's basketball team to play its home games in an off-campus facility until the 1981-82 team moved to the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. Ground had been broken on campus for the construction of McDonough Gymnasium, which would host Georgetowns home games for 30 years beginning the next season.\nRoster.\nSources\n1950–51 schedule and results.\nIt had been a common practice for many years for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the February 3, 1951, game against the New York Athletic Club therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1950–51. It was not until 1952 after the completion of the 1951–52 season that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

On 154 occasions, the home side won, 118 away sides won, 5 draws and 63 neutral venue matches. 2013 marked two years to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, meaning for most tournaments; Africa Cup, Asian Five Nations, European Nations Cup, Oceania Cup and South American Rugby Championship acted as Rugby World Cup qualifiers. The Americas playoffs saw the first team to qualify for the World Cup, with Canada winning 40–20 on aggregate against the United States, to join Pool D as Americas 1. The fourteenth edition of the Six Nations Championship took place in February and March with Wales retaining the championship with a 30–3 record winning margin against England, while in August, September and October, the second edition of the Rugby Championship took place with New Zealand completing the sweep winning 6 from 6 to retain the championship.\nJune 2013, the busiest month of the year at 87 matches or 73 test matches, marked 125 years of the British &amp; Irish Lions, as the Lions embarked on a 3-test tour against Australia, finishing with a historic 41–16 victory to seal a 2–1 test series win for the first time in 16 years. To end the year, November 2013 saw the number one test side the All Blacks win their fourteenth from fourteenth test match of the year, the first team to win every match in a calendar year in the professional era.\nThe IRB World Rankings changed very little from the end of 2012 to the end of 2013. New Zealand remained ranked number one a position they have held since 2010, South Africa stayed in second and Australia in third. England moved up to fourth from fifth where they were in 2012, while Samoa remained the highest tier 2 side despite falling one place to eighth in 2013. Japan slowly climbs the rankings ahead of their home Rugby World Cup in 2019 following a successful year. They earned their first win over Wales in Tokyo in June, before hosting the All Blacks for the first time in Japan. They scored the most tries than any other team at 75, 18 of which came in their 121–0 win over Philippines. Spain drew more matches than any other team this year, while Benin, Brunei and Burundi failed to score a single point in all their international matches.\nThe 340 matches below all contain an international team, some of which are not members of the International Rugby Board:"

        "text": "The 1949–50 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1949–50 NCAA college basketball season. Francis \"Buddy\" O'Grady coached it in his first of three seasons as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at the D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 12-12 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nNew head coach O'Grady had been a three-year standout guard on the Hoya teams of 1939-1942. After military service in World War II, he had played professional basketball for three seasons with the Washington Capitols and the Rochester Royals before retiring to coach at Georgetown.\nAlthough coaches of the freshman team had assisted the varsity teams head coach from time to time, Georgetown had never had a formal assistant coach on the varsity team until this season, when former Georgetown player Jim \"Miggs\" Reilly became the Hoyas first formal assistant coach.\nThe season saw the beginning of annual meetings between rivals Fordham and Georgetown, which would continue through 1979.\nGuard Tommy O'Keefe played an unprecedented fourth season on the varsity team this year. Freshmen were ineligible for varsity play under National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules at the time, but this had been lifted for four seasons during and just after World War II. The NCAA restored freshman ineligibility in 1947, but when the Georgetown athletic department petitioned the NCAA to recognize O'Keefes 1946-47 sophomore season at Georgetown as the equivalent of a freshman season prior to the NCAA restoration of freshman ineligibility, the NCAA agreed, allowing O'Keefe to play for Georgetown for a fourth season in 1949-50. He led the 1949-50 team, scoring in double figures in 21 of its 24 games. Early in the year, he shot 10-for-15 from the field in Georgetowns upset of Penn State, and he had a career-high 23 points in an upset of Rutgers. He finished as the teams leading scorer for the third straight year – the first Georgetown player to lead for three straight seasons in 15 years – and was selected to play on the East team alongside Holy Cross standout Bob Cousy in the East-West All-Star Game.\nGeorgetown's January 14, 1950, game against Holy Cross at Worcester Memorial Auditorium in Worcester, Massachusetts, was the Hoyas' first against a team ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press Poll. Cousey led the Crusaders to a 77–51 victory over Georgetown.\nThe young, undersized 1949-50 team started with a 10-5 record in its first 15 games, but then struggled, losing seven of its last nine games to finish the year at 12-12. It had no postseason play and was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll at any time.\nO'Keefe ended his Georgetown career with 1,018 points, the first Georgetown player in history to score more than 1,000 points. He would go on to play professional basketball for one season with the Washington Capitols and Baltimore Bullets in 1950-51 and to serve as Georgetowns assistant coach for four seasons from 1956 to 1960 and as head coach for six seasons from 1960 to 1966.\nRoster.\nSources\n1949–50 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the December 9, 1949, game against the New York Athletic Club therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1949-50. It was not until 1952 after the completion of the 1951-52 season that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2015 Rose Bowl (officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual) was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2015, at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. This 101st Rose Bowl Game, as a semifinal for the College Football Playoff (CFP), matched the Oregon Ducks against the Florida State Seminoles as selected by the system's selection committee to compete for a spot at the National Championship game to be played on January 12, 2015, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It was one of the 2014–15 bowl games that concluded the 2014 FBS football season.\nThe game was televised on ESPN and ESPN Deportes, and broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, with the kickoff time set for 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. local time). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association organized the game. The Northwestern Mutual financial services organization sponsored the game.\nOn the match day, the 126th edition of the annual Rose Parade took place at 8 am Pacific Time with a theme of \"Inspiring Stories\".\nOregon won the game, beating Florida State, the last undefeated team of the season, by the score of 59–20 and advanced to the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship Game, assuring that no team would finish the season with a perfect record.\nPre-game activities.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at Disney California Adventure in nearby Anaheim. The teams were also treated to The LA Improv in Hollywood. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held prior to the game at the Pasadena Convention Center. Knute Rockne, Notre Dame; Dick Vermeil, UCLA; and Ki-Jana Carter, Penn State headlined the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Class of 2014.\nPre-game activities were held at the Rose Bowl parking lots and at Brookside Golf Course.\nTeams.\nThe two participants were announced on December 7, 2014 (12:45 PM ET), based on the final rankings by the CFP committee. The Oregon Ducks will play the Florida State Seminoles. The matchups for the Rose Bowl and the other semifinal, the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, were geographically selected to ensure the top team will be closest to its fanbase. More than one team from the same conference may participate in the game, and avoiding rematches will not be a selection factor.\nTraditionally, the Rose Bowl pits the winners of the Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference; however, when the Rose Bowl is a CFP semifinal (every three years beginning with this game), any teams may be selected. Oregon was the Pac-12 champion, but the Big Ten champion Ohio State played in (and won) the Sugar Bowl. The 2015 edition of the Rose Bowl was the first time since the 2006 edition (BCS National Championship Game) that the Big Ten Conference was absent from the game. It was also the first ever time in the 101-year history of the Rose Bowl that the Atlantic Coast Conference made an appearance in the game. Duke did appear in 1942, however, the ACC never was established until 1953. Also, while Miami competed and won the 2002 game, which was also a BCS National Championship Game. However, Miami was still a member of the original Big East Conference.\nFlorida State.\nFlorida State wore its white jerseys and used the east bench on game day.\nOregon.\nOregon wore its green jerseys and used the west bench on game day.\nGame summary.\nScoring summary.\nSource: \nRecords.\nOregon broke the record for the most points (59) scored in a Rose Bowl, surpassing the previous record of 49 (set in 1902, then tied in 1948 and 2008). Oregon's 41 points in the second half were also the most ever scored in one half of a Rose Bowl. Oregon set the Rose Bowl record for total offensive yards (639)."

        "text": "The Spaghetti Bowl was an American football bowl game played between Fifth Army and Twelfth Air Force in Florence, Italy, on 1 January 1945. The game was won by the Army 20–0.\nBackground.\nDuring World War II, it was not uncommon for American military personnel to hold football games while stationed overseas in order to maintain morale. For example, 1 January 1945 also saw matches in France (the Riviera Bowl in Marseille) and Britain (the Coffee Bowl in London). Post-war military games also took place, such as an Associated Press wire report noting a contest between American soldiers from Salzburg and airmen from Wiesbaden Army Airfield, played in Leghorn, Italy in 1953.\nWhile based in Florence, the Twelfth Air Force's Special Service received a set of 120 football uniforms and organized a game with the Fifth Army. The Army squad, known as the Krautclouters, was coached by Lou Bush, a Captain and former star for the University of Massachusetts Minutemen in football and basketball who also played baseball in the St. Louis Cardinals' farm system. The 12th Air Force, who went by the team name Bridgebusters, was skippered by Major George \"Sparky\" Miller, a former lineman and assistant coach with Indiana University.\nPlayers for the Army included Philadelphia Eagles tackle Sergeant Cecil Sturgeon and black Los Angeles Bulldogs fullback Corporal John \"Big Six\" Moody. Sturgeon was the lone player in the game with National Football League experience, and he served as the Army's captain; Air Force tackle Bernard Buckiewitz was also listed on the program as a former member of the Green Bay Packers, though he did not play an official game for them. The Air Force was captained by Lieutenant George Barnes, a former quarterback at the University of Maryland.\nGame.\nThe Spaghetti Bowl served as the \"de facto\" championship game between the service teams of the European military theater. As it was the only edition with the war close to conclusion, it was branded the \"First and Last Spaghetti Bowl\". It was played at Stadio Giovanni Berta, but the location was kept secret for fear of an air raid by the Luftwaffe; reports after the game told of a German broadcast proclaiming it would be \"a great day for an air raid at Florence\" while another said, \"Nero fiddled while Rome burned and the Fifth army and 12th airforce are going to play football while Forence burns.\" Practices for the game were also held in private, prompting the AP's Sid Feder to quip that the teams were more \"hush hush than a ward room where they plan an amphibious landing.\" Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft flew over the stadium on patrol duty, though no attack ultimately took place.\n25,000 attended the game, with all ticketed spectators being military personnel though some civilians sneaked in. Due to the cold weather, the Red Cross provided concessions like hot dogs, coffee, and donuts. Other attendees came as part of a United Service Organizations tour, including Broadway theatre singer Ella Logan, Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher, and New York Giants outfielder Joe Medwick; Durocher and Medwick also gave speeches at halftime. 56-person Army bands and majorette Peggy Jean performed at the game, while parade floats were constructed out of Army vehicles with Women's Army Corps members riding them. The game also included a mule as a mascot.\nMoody rushed for the first two touchdowns of the game, while Georgetown wide receiver Lt. Arthur Lemke caught the third and final touchdown from ex-Florida quarterback Private Frank Buel. The game's trophy was a metal bowl containing paper spaghetti, while the Krautclouters also received brass medals."

Most matches were played at the Estadio Universitario and the Estadio Tecnológico in Monterrey. After the first four matches yielded just two goals, locals dubbed it the \"Group of Sleep\". Morocco surprisingly topped the group, joined in the second round by England and Poland. Portugal were the other team in this group, making their first appearance since 1966.\nMorocco drew their first two matches 0–0 against Poland and England, while Portugal defeated England in their opening match 1–0, but were themselves beaten by Poland by the same scoreline. England's match against Morocco featured their first sending-off in a World Cup, when Ray Wilkins was shown a red card after throwing the ball which struck the referee when an offside decision went against England. Thus, Poland led the group after two games, with Portugal in second place on goals scored. However, England defeated Poland 3–0 with a first half hat-trick from Gary Lineker to take second place behind Morocco, who beat Portugal 3–1 with goals from Abderrazak Khairi and Abdelkrim Merry. Poland, in third, only qualified for the second round as one of the four best third-place finishers.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 1999–2000 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1999–2000 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by Craig Esherick in his first full season as head coach; he had replaced John Thompson in mid-season the previous year after Thompsons resignation. The Hoyas played most of their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC, although they played two home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season 19-15, 6-10 in Big East play. They advanced to the semifinals of the 2000 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Connecticut. Not invited to the NCAA tournament, they appeared in the 2000 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) – their third consecutive NIT appearance – and advanced to the second round before losing to California.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nAfter Georgetown stumbled to a 15-16 record the previous season – the Hoyas first losing season since 1972-73 – Esherick, with control over the team for a full season for the first time, introduced a taller lineup this year centered around 6-foot-7 (201-cm) freshman forward Victor Samnick, 6-foot-10 freshman center (208-cm) Lee Scruggs, and 6-foot-11 (211-cm) junior center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje. This change reduced junior guard Nat Burton into a reserve role and his offensive production dropped from the previous year, but he nonetheless started 15 of the teams 34 games and averaged 7.1 points and 4.8 rebounds per game for the season. He scored in double figures seven times.\nJunior guard Anthony Perry had led the team in scoring the previous year, and he started this season strong, including 18 points against fourth-ranked North Carolina and 19 against sixth-ranked Florida in back-to-back games in the Maui Invitational Tournament in the latter half of November 1999. On January 8, 2000, however, he shot only 1-for-10 (10%) from the field against Seton Hall at the MCI Center, and after that his scoring declined. By the end of the year, he was averaging only 8.7 points per game, down from 14.0 points per game the previous season, although his shooting average from the field improved from 33.8 percent in 1998-99 to 34.7 percent in 1999-2000 and he scored the winning basket as the Hoyas upset Louisville at the MCI Center at the beginning of February 2000.\nWith Perry in a shooting slump for much of the season, sophomore guard Kevin Braswell led the team in scoring. Starting all 34 games – in fact, he started all 128 games during his collegiate career – he averaged 22.3 points per game during the three games of the Maui Invitational and scored in double figures 10 times in the first 11 games of the year. Although he shot only 1-for-13 (7.7%) from the field in the Big East season opener against Providence, he recovered to shoot a combined 45% from the field and average 20 points a game in five straight games in January 2000. Inconsistent play plagued him throughout his career, however, and he followed this successful five-game stretch with another five games in which he shot only a combined 17 percent from the field.\nAn injury forced junior center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje to miss the season opener, and it limited him in the next four games. In the sixth and seventh games of the year, however, he scored a combined 35 points and grabbed 21 rebounds against Howard and Bethune–Cookman. He followed this up with 18 points and 15 rebounds against James Madison at the beginning of January 2000, a career-high 32 points against Southern of New Orleans in February 2000, and 27 points against Pittsburgh three days later; by mid-February he was averaging 18 points, eight rebounds, and three blocked shots per game in Big East play. A foot injury sidelined him late in the regular season, but he finished the year averaging 12.8 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 2.5 blocked shots per game for the season overall.\nAfter the defeat of James Madison at the beginning of 2000, Georgetowns record stood at 8-3 – with two of the losses against Top Six opponents – as Big East play began, and hopes ran high among Hoya fans that the team could win the conferences regular season behind the play of Boumtje-Boumtje, Braswell, Perry, and the others. However, the 1999-2000 Hoyas were a disappointment in conference play, posting a 16-13 regular-season record overall and finishing in a three-way tie for eighth place in the Big East with a 6-10 conference record.\nBig East tournament.\nThe eighth-place finish gave the Hoyas the No. 9 seed in the 2000 Big East tournament. In the first round, they upset No. 8 seed West Virginia, with Braswell scoring 19 points, including a game-winning three-pointer with less than a second left in the game.\nThe Hoyas advanced to a quarterfinal meeting the following day with archrival Syracuse, ranked 12th in the nation and seeded No. 1 in the tournament. During the early part of the first half of the game and again early in the second half, Georgetowns defense held Syracuse scoreless for a stretch, allowing the Hoyas to build a seven-point lead. Scruggs shot 9-for-14 (64.3%) from the field and scored 20 points. Braswell also had a 20-point game, including a 10-for-12 (83.3%) performance from the free-throw line, as well as eight assists. Braswell and Georgetown guard Demetrius Hunter held Syracuse senior point guard Jason Hart to 3-for-10 (30%) shooting from the field. When Braswell passed the ball inside to Boumtje-Boumtje and Boumtje-Boumtje scored on a dunk with 4:29 to play, electrifying the crowd, Georgetown took a 60-51 lead. Syracuse closed to a three-point deficit but got no closer, and after Braswell deflected the ball late in the game, Georgetown won 76-72 in a huge upset. It was only the second time in 19 years that a Big East tournament No. 1 seed lost in the quarterfinals. During the game, the Hoyas shot 27-for-31 (87.1%) from the free-throw line, while Syracuse shot only 9-for-18 (50%) in free throws.\nThe big win over Syracuse gave Georgetown its only appearance in the semifinals of the Big East tournament between 1997 and 2006. In the semifinal game, the Hoyas faced the tournaments No. 4 seed, 21st-ranked Connecticut, and lost 70-55. The loss left Georgetown with an overall record of 18-14, not enough to receive an invitation to the 2000 NCAA tournament. It was the third straight season that Georgetown missed the tournament, the first time that had happened since the 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1973-74 teams had missed postseason play in consecutive years.\nNational Invitation tournament.\nFor the third consecutive season, Georgetown appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the first round, the Hoyas went on the road on March 15, 2000, to face favored Virginia on national television in one of the greatest games in both NIT and Georgetown history.\nThe Hoyas entered the game with both Boumtje-Boumtje and Samnick out with injuries and only nine scholarship players available. In the first half, Braswell shot 1-for-6 (16.7%) in his first six field goal attempts and missed his first two free throws, while Scruggs committed two personal fouls early in the game. Virginia, meanwhile, scored easily and went on a 14-0 run, although Georgetown freshman guard Demetrius Hunter kept Georgetown in the game with four three-point shots and the Hoyas managed to tie the game at 29-29 with 6:36 left in the half. Virginia pulled away again, and at halftime led 49-38. By five minutes into the second half, the Cavaliers had extended their lead to 58-43, but the Hoyas then went on a 17-2 run to tie the game at 60-60 with under 11 minutes to play. Virginia took the lead with 7:48 left in regulation and the Hoyas lost Hunter, freshman forward Courtland Freeman, and senior center Jameel Watkins to foul-outs. In the final 3:39 of regulation, Virginia shot 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field, and Georgetown trailed by only four points with less than two minutes left. With 1:48 remaining, Burton sank two free throws, and, after Virginia failed to score on its next position, Perry scored on a layup to tie the score at 77-77 with 1:14 left. Scruggs blocked a Virginia drive to the basket with two seconds left, Burton missed on a 50-foot (15-meter) last-second shot, and the game went into overtime.\nIn the first overtime, Virginia opened strong but the Hoyas stayed close and took an 84-83 lead on a Nat Burton tip-in, after which Braswell scored on two free throws to give Georgetown an 86-83 lead. Scruggs began to limp and came out of the game, reducing the Hoyas to only four scholarship players (Braswell, Burton, Perry, and senior forward Rhese Gibson) and walk-on sophomore forward Gharun Hester. Despite the shortage of personnel, Georgetown held an 88-85 lead with 14 seconds left when Hester fouled Virginia freshman guard Roger Mason, Jr., as he scored, and he sank his free throw to tie the game at 88-88 and force a second overtime. Television cameras had detected a Virginia guard calling a time-out when the Cavaliers had none left, which should have resulted in a technical foul, but when Esherick complained about it between overtime periods he was called for a technical instead.\nWith 2:51 left in the second overtime and Virginia leading 96-93, an exhausted Scruggs went to the bench. Perry tied the game with a three-pointer, after which Virginias Donald Hand hit a three-pointer. Braswell then replied wkith another three-pointer – the third three-point shot in a minute – to tie the game at 99-99. After Virginia missed on its next possession and then fouled Gibson, Gibson sank two free throws to give the Hoyas a 101-99 lead. With 24 seconds remaining, Virginia sophomore forward Chris Williams scored to tie the game at 101-101, making Virginia the first team to score 100 or more points against Georgetown since Seton Hall scored 102 in a win over the Hoyas in January 1976. Time expired, and Georgetown played a third overtime for the first time since January 1955.\nWith only five players left and three of them playing with four fouls, Georgetown had to avoid fouling and Chris Williams was able to take advantage of that to score twice and give Virginia a 105-101 lead with 3:38 remaining. But then the Hoya defense stopped Virginia on three consecutive possessions while Hester, Burton, and Braswell each scored, giving Georgetown a 107-105 lead with 2:20 left to play. After each team sank two free throws, Virginia scored inside to tie the game at 109-109 with 40 seconds left. After a time-out, Braswell passed the ball to Hester, who launched a 22-foot (6.7-meter) shot and scored the first three-point field goal of his two-year collegiate career, giving the Hoyas a 112-109 lead with 31 seconds to play. Virginia barely missed a three-pointer in response, Georgetown sank one of two free throws, and the Cavaliers then scored inside to close to 113-111. Virginia got the ball back, again missed a three-pointer, and fouled Braswell with 6.8 seconds remaining. After Braswell missed one of his two free throws, Virginia was trailing 114-111 and still had a chance to tie the game, but the Cavaliers threw the ball out of bounds and fouled Braswell on the inbounds pass. Braswell sank one of his two free throws and the game finally ended after three-and-a-half hours of play with a 115-111 upset Hoya victory. Scruggs and Braswell required intravenous fluids after the game.\nThe Hoyas shot 49 percent from the field during the game. Gibson tied his career high with 13 rebounds in 38 minutes of play, while Gharun Hester had career highs in both points scored (9) and rebounds (10). Braswell scored 11 field goals, 14 free throws, and 40 points in the game – joining Allen Iverson as the only Georgetown players since 1970 to score 40 points in a game – with 14 of his points coming in the second half and 18 in the three overtimes; he shot 4-for-6 (66.7%) from the field and 10-for-12 (83.3%) from the free-throw line in overtime. His 49 minutes of play set a record for the most minutes played by one Georgetown player in a single game.\nThe game set a number of other records, including the most combined points in a Georgetown game (226, breaking the previous record of 216 set in a game against Holy Cross in January 1973), the most combined points in an NIT game (breaking the previous record of 213 set by Connecticut and Holy Cross in the 1955 NIT), the most three-point field goals made in a Georgetown game (12, tying the record set twice in 1996 in games against Providence and Miami), most points scored by Georgetown in a postseason game (115, breaking the record of 98 set against Texas Tech in the 1996 NCAA tournament), and the most combined points in a Georgetown post-season game (226, breaking the record of 188 set in the Texas Tech game in the 1996 NCAA tournament).\nSix days after the grueling win over Virginia, Georgetown faced California in the second round.

Post-WW2 Yugoslavia was (with the exception of major cities such as Belgrade, Ljubljana, Zagreb and Sarajevo) for the most part lacking in competitive opportunities in sports. In response to this, 1945 and 1946 saw an explosion of new clubs and leagues for every sport, the basketball league being part of this phenomenon.\nThe very first competition under the newly formed Yugoslav Basketball League in 1945, drawing parallel to the Yugoslav First League (of football), was more or less a nationwide affirmation of unity. Instead of individual clubs competing in the usual fashion, there were only eight teams. Six representing each state within Yugoslavia, one representing the province of Vojvodina, and the last representing the Yugoslav People's Army."

        "title": "1998–99 Welsh rugby union rebel season",
        "text": "The 1998–99 rebel season in rugby union occurred when two clubs affiliated to the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), Cardiff RFC and Swansea RFC, refused to play in the WRU-sanctioned Welsh Premier Division that season and instead opted to play friendly matches against clubs from the English Premiership. The two clubs' position came about after the WRU rejected requests by the club to pursue changes to the league structure in Welsh club rugby and in particular to set up a cross-border league involving other clubs in Britain, and the two clubs refused to sign up to a loyalty agreement with the WRU committing them to the current league setup.\nThe two clubs were removed from Wales' entry into the 1998–99 Heineken Cup and would later be fined £150,000 each by the WRU for three breaches of their regulations. The English Rugby Football Union (RFU) didn't sanction the rebel games, but were accused by rugby union's world governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB), of not doing enough to prevent the fixtures taking place and had £60,000 of IRB funding withdrawn.\nAt the end of the season, an agreement was reached between the two clubs and the Welsh Rugby Union that allowed for their return to the Welsh Premier Division, with clauses that would allow them to leave the Welsh league and join the English Premiership in the event a cross-border British league was not set-up by the 2000–01 season. Despite this league not coming to fruition, the two clubs did not exercise their right to leave and remained in the Welsh structure.\nBackground.\nCardiff RFC and Swansea RFC had both been members of the Welsh Premier Division since the formation of the league system in Wales in September 1990. Informal talks had taken place around an Anglo-Welsh league, containing Cardiff, Swansea, Neath and Llanelli, as early as 1993, with the public support of then-Wales coach Alan Davies. In August 1995, rugby union became a professional game, which allowed payment or benefits to be made to players. Following the change to professionalism, several of the clubs playing in the Premier Division began experiencing financial difficulties. Llanelli RFC sold their ground, Stradey Park, to the WRU in 1997 to raise money, Neath RFC were taken over by a WRU-owned subsidiary Gower Park Ltd. in May 1998. Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC were also in financial difficulties.\nAgainst this backdrop, the WRU wished to have clubs in the Premier Division sign 10-year loyalty agreements. These four page agreements would see the clubs assured of their places in the top-flight of the league system for the duration of the agreement, in exchange for their commitment to remain playing in the league system. However, both Swansea and Cardiff saw insufficient returns available from the Welsh league, and refused to sign up to the loyalty agreements, instead suggesting the setup of a British league involving four clubs from Wales, the clubs that comprised the top division in England and two Scottish regional sides; Edinburgh and Glasgow. This proposal was supported by both the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the clubs that comprised the top two divisions in England, but was rejected by the WRU, owing to ongoing legal action between the RFU and English clubs over commercial rights, and the ongoing legal action taken by Cardiff. The WRU reiterated their requirement that Cardiff and Swansea sign up to the loyalty agreement in order to continue participating in the Premier Division and the European Cup.\nConfirmation of Breakaway.\nEight days before the 1998–99 Premier Division was due to start, Swansea and Cardiff released a statement that confirmed their position that they would play friendly matches against English clubs rather than participate in the Welsh Premier Division. The two clubs had organised to play each of the 14 teams of the English Premiership on a home and away basis, with the matches scheduled alongside the Premiership so that each weekend of the season, 12 of the English clubs played league matches while two clubs would have a free weekend in the league to allow them to play the two Welsh clubs. The two clubs sold the television coverage rights to the matches themselves, with the BBC acquiring the rights. By contrast, the rights to cover the Premier Division fixtures were held by HTV and S4C.\nAt a general committee meeting held on 24 August; the WRU formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the Premier Division and replaced them. Cardiff's position was given to Newport RFC, who had been relegated at the end of the 1997–98 season and Swansea's to Aberavon RFC, who had finished second in Division One, the tier below the Premier Division. The WRU confirmed their position that any matches Cardiff and Swansea played against opponents from England would not be sanctioned. The RFU also refused to sanction the friendly matches, which meant neither union would provide match officials for the games, resulting in retired and junior officials being called upon for these games.\nRebel games.\nInitially, the friendly games were contested as promised between full-strength teams. Cardiff's first home fixture came against Saracens, with over 10,000 fans attending Cardiff Arms Park to watch Cardiff defeat Saracens by 40–19. The quality of opposition continued to remain high until the end of the year, however as the season progressed into 1999, the demands of the Premiership season combined with the loss of players to international callups during the 1999 Five Nations tournament led to reduced strength sides being fielded by some Premiership clubs, and blowout scores being recorded as a result, including Cardiff beating a development Richmond side by 96–28 in May. By comparison, Richmond had won the December encounter between the two sides 35–28.\nIn December 1998, the WRU announced it would be fining Cardiff and Swansea a total of £150,000 each for several breaches of their regulations. The regulations breached were playing in unsanctioned matches, negotiating their own television contracts and playing in matches with unapproved officials, with the first two offences carrying fines of £60,000 and the third resulting in a £30,000 fine. The WRU imposed a deadline of the end of February to pay the fines by, however both clubs announced they would refuse to pay. Despite not formally sanctioning the games, the English RFU were accused by the governing body of rugby union, the International Rugby Board (IRB) of not doing enough to prevent the fixtures from taking place. A day after the WRU had fined the two Welsh clubs, the IRB announced that the RFU would miss out on £60,000 of funding that they were due to receive from the IRB Trust, effectively imposing a fine on the union for not taking action.\nDespite not competing in either the Welsh Premier Division or in the European Cup, both Cardiff and Swansea participated in the WRU organised Challenge Cup competition, which at the time was branded under the name of its sponsor Swalec. Cardiff chief executive Gareth Davies believed that the reason for their inclusion was to appease the sponsor who might otherwise had withdrawn their backing. This competition saw them compete against other Welsh clubs, and as such, the games took on increased importance as Cardiff and Swansea tried to justify their improved standard following cross-border competition as compared to the clubs that had remained in the Welsh league system. Both teams reached the semi-finals where Cardiff were drawn against Llanelli RFC and Swansea against Cross Keys RFC. In the week prior to the game, Cardiff chairman Peter Thomas spoke to the players following a training session, where he emphasised the importance of winning the game, describing it as \"the biggest game in the club's history\". Cardiff went on to lose the game. In the other semi-final Swansea recorded a convincing win over Cross Keys. Swansea then beat Llanelli in the final to win the cup.\nReconciliation.\nAn emergency meeting was held by the WRU in May 1999, at which the two sides came to an agreement that would see Cardiff and Swansea return to the Welsh Premier Division for the 1999–2000 season, with an agreement that both sides could join the English Premiership for the 2000–01 season in the event that a British league had not been set up. Also as part of the agreement, Cardiff and Swansea signed loyalty agreements with the WRU scheduled to run for the remaining eight years and were also nominated as two of the Welsh representatives in the 1999-2000 European Cup, despite the positions usually being awarded based upon Welsh Premier Division league positions. Cardiff and Swansea's inclusion came at the expense of Ebbw Vale RFC, who would normally have been nominated based on their 1998–99 league position.\nLegacy.\nA British league wasn't set up for the 2000–01 season, however neither Cardiff nor Swansea entered the English Premiership. The two Scottish District sides joined the Welsh sides in forming a Welsh-Scottish League from the 1999 - 2000 season. For the 2001–02 season, the Celtic League ran alongside the 2001-02 Welsh-Scottish League, involving sides from Wales, Scotland and Ireland in a pool/knockout format competition. The 10 year loyalty agreements, which was scheduled to run through to August 2007 were torn up by the WRU in 2003 to allow introduction of regional rugby. With the creation of the five regional teams from Wales, the Celtic League was changed into a traditional double round-robin league."

        "text": "The 1945–46 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1945–46 NCAA college basketball season. Ken Engles coached it in his only season as head coach. It played its home games on the campus of The Catholic University of America at Brookland Gymnasium in Washington, D.C., the only Georgetown team to play home games there with the exception of the 1946-47 team, which played four games there the following season.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown had made its only post-season tournament appearance thus far in the 1942-43 season, when it advanced to the final of the 1943 NCAA Tournament. However, the school had suspended all of its athletic programs later in 1943 for the duration of World War II, prompting head coach Elmer Ripley to leave to coach at Columbia and ending the collegiate careers of many of its players, while other Georgetown players who retained eligibility transferred to other schools to continue their collegiate basketball careers or entered military service, planning to return to Georgetown and resume college basketball there after the war.\nGeorgetown had no basketball program during the 1943–44 and 1944-45 seasons. After World War II ended in August 1945, the school resumed athletic competition and began to put together a varsity mens basketball team for the 1945–46 season. Ripley had left Columbia after coaching there for two years but had committed to coach Notre Dame in 1945–46, and those Georgetown players from the 1942–43 team retaining eligibility to play had either transferred elsewhere or had not yet returned to Georgetown from military service.\nAs result of all of this, the team Georgetown fielded for the season was unusual. With Ripley unavailable, senior forward Ken Engles – an older player who had played on the 1940-41 and 1941-42 teams before leaving school after the United States entered World War II – had returned this season for his third and final year of eligibility, and he was pressed into service as head coach, becoming the only player-coach in Georgetown men's basketball history. Aside from Engles, none of the players had prior varsity experience, and only one of them – freshman forward Ed Benigni – played on the team the following season when Ripley returned to coach Georgetown.\nThe virtually all-walk-on 1945–46 team played an abbreviated schedule, finishing with a record of 11-9 and having no postseason play.\nRoster.\nSources\nFrom the 1943–44 season through the 1946-47 season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) suspended its freshman ineligibility rule. Georgetown had no athletic programs during the 1943–44 and 1944-45 seasons, so this was the first Georgetown varsity team to include freshman.\nSome players appeared in only one or a handful of games in this unusual season, leading to the large size of the roster.\n1945–46 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the games played against United States Army teams from Fort George G. Meade and the United States Army War College and a United States Navy team from Naval Annex Anacostia therefore counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1945–46. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951–52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

Three Norwegian athletes, Marit Bjørgen, Therese Johaug, and Kristin Størmer Steira, took the lead from 1 km on and skied in the group, never being threatened by other competitors. At the finish line, Bjørgen won gold, Johaug finished second, and Størmer Steira was third. This is the first gold for Norway in women's 30 km race, and the first clean sweep in Olympic cross country skiing since 1992. For Bjørgen, this was the sixth Winter Olympic gold medal, which, together with Lidiya Skoblikova and Lyubov Yegorova, made her a woman with the largest number of Winter Olympics gold medals won. Størmer Steira won her first individual Olympic medal. The defending 2010 champion Justyna Kowalczyk did not finish.\nQualification.\nAn athlete with a maximum of 100 FIS distance points (the A standard) will be allowed to compete in both or one of the event (sprint/distance). An athlete with a maximum 120 FIS sprint points will be allowed to compete in the sprint event and 10 km for women or 15 km for men provided their distance points do not exceed 300 FIS points. NOC's who do not have any athlete meeting the A standard can enter one competitor of each sex (known as the basic quota) in only 10 km classical event for women or 15 km classical event for men. They must have a maximum of 300 FIS distance points at the end of qualifying on January 20, 2014. The qualification period began in July 2012.\nResults.\nThe race started at 13:30."

        "text": "The 1958–59 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1958–59 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tom Nolan coached them in his third season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 8-15 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1958–1959 season saw the beginning of an annual series between Georgetown and Boston College that would continue through the 2004–2005 season, after which the rivalry between the schools came to end with the departure of Boston College from the Big East Conference.\nThe 1958–1959 Georgetown team was undersized — averaging 6-feet-1 (185 cm) in height and with no player taller than 6-foot-4 (193 cm) — and inexperienced, with only one senior on the roster. Diminutive sophomore guard Brian \"Puddy\" Sheehan, the team's 5-foot-9 (175 cm) point guard, who was an expert ballhandler and a dominant player throughout his college career, emerged as the team's top scorer, averaging 18.4 points per game despite being the smallest man on the court. In his debut, he scored 30 points – a school record for points scored in a debut game – and he turned in a 25-point performance against Connecticut, 23 against Boston College, and 22 in a win over Syracuse. He scored only nine points in one of the games against Maryland, but he scored in double figures in every other game.\nSophomore center Tom Coleman also joined the varsity from the freshman team this year as its tallest player at 6-foot-4 (193 cm). He led the team in rebounding and scored 22 points in an upset of Loyola of Chicago and 31 against George Washington.\nAnother player to join the varsity from the freshman team was sophomore forward Tom Matan, and he probably had his most productive season this year. Able to play forward and center, he was an effective inside scorer, averaging 14.3 points per game this season, with 30 points in the upset of Loyola of Chicago, 27 against Loyola of Maryland, and 26 against Seton Hall.\nAmong four players suspended for the year partway through the previous season because of their grades, junior forward Tom McCloskey was the only one of the four to return to the team this season. He scored in double figures in 15 games, had 17 points in the upset of Loyola of Chicago and 20 in the win over Syracuse. He and junior guard Dick Razzetti both opted not to return to the varsity team the following season and instead play intramural basketball – leading their team to the 1960 intramural title – while McCloskey focused on his studies.\nYoung, inexperienced, always playing against larger and stronger players, and with 15 of their 23 games on the road, the undersized 1958–1959 Hoyas lost 10 of their last 13 games, concluding the season with seven straight losses. They struggled to an 8-15 finish, the worst record of Tom Nolan's four-year coaching tenure and worst by a Georgetown team since the 1934-35 season. The team had no post-season play, and was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSources\nBeginning this season and continuing through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nJunior guard Ed Hargaden Jr., was the first second-generation Georgetown men's basketball player, his father, guard Ed Hargaden, having been a standout guard on the 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35 teams. He also was the only second-generation player in school history until center Patrick Ewings son, forward Patrick Ewing Jr., joined the team in the 2006-07 season.\n1958–59 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

He joined the varsity team this season. He scored a career-high 24 points against Loyola of Maryland in the season opener, and by the middle of January 1958 he had scored in double figures in six of the team's seven games. McCloskey and junior forward Jack Nies were averaging a combined 22 points per game by February.\nMcCloskey's and Nies's season came to a sudden end when they were among four players Georgetown placed on academic suspension for the rest of the season even though they remained academically eligible under National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) standards. McCloskey's abbreviated season ended with him averaging 12.4 points and 7.6 rebounds per game.\nSenior forward Ken Pichette carried the weight as the team's main scorer after the departure of McCloskey and Nies, averaging 19 points per game after they were suspended, not counting 31 points he scored in the mid-February exhibition game against the New York Athletic Club.

        "title": "1952–53 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1952–53 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1952–53 NCAA college basketball season. Harry \"Buddy\" Jeannette – who had played professional basketball from 1938 to 1950 and had coached the original Baltimore Bullets from 1947 to 1951 – coached the 1952–53 Hoyas in his first season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 13-7 – the most successful team of Jeannette's four-year tenure as head coach – and became the first Georgetown men's basketball team ever to be invited to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), losing to Louisville in the first round of the 1953 NIT.\nSeason recap.\nJunior guard Lou Gigante became the team's starting point guard this season. He scored in all 20 of the team's games and in double figures in 11 of the last 15 during the Hoyas' drive for a post-season tournament berth; his 17 points against Navy was particularly notable, and his play at point guard brought the Hoyas close to an upset of a 4th-ranked La Salle team led by Tom Gola.\nAlthough one of the previous season's top scorers, Barry Sullivan, left school for military service and did not return for this season, the other half of that year's scoring tandem, now-senior center and team captain Bill Bolger, did return. He played in all 20 games and led the team in scoring in 11 of them. He had double-figure scoring performances in 18 games, including 29 against Seattle and 26 against Rhode Island back-to-back in the two games of the Boston Arena Tournament in late December 1952 and 17 points against St. Joseph's and 23 against Fordham in big wins later in the year as Georgetown made its push for a postseason tournament bid.\nAlso starring during the year was senior center Hugh Beins. Beins played in all 20 games and scored in double figures 13 times, with particularly impressive performances against Temple, Virginia, and Fordham and a career-high 23 points against Canisius. He also turned in one of his finest defensive performances against George Washington, holding George Washington star Joe Holup – a 2,000-point, 2,000-rebound player during his collegiate career – to nine points as the Hoyas beat the Colonials in the regular-season finale, Georgetown's only defeat of George Washington during Holup's college years.\nThe win over Fordham was crucial in convincing the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) selection committee to invite Georgetown to the 1953 NIT, the school's first-ever NIT appearance. It was only the second post-season tournament appearance in Georgetown men's basketball history and the first since the 1942–43 team advanced to the final game of the 1943 NCAA Tournament. In the first round of the NIT, the Hoyas met Louisville at Madison Square Garden. Gigante scored 13 points and Bolger had a team-high 20-point performance. But fouls plagued Georgetown during the game; five Hoyas fouled out, and Louisville made 36 of its 52 free throws and won the game 92–79 to knock Georgetown out of the postseason.\nBolger graduated as the leading scorer in Georgetown history at the time, and the second to score 1,000 points – doing it in three seasons when the only other 1,000-point scorer in school history, Tommy O'Keefe, had taken four seasons to hit that mark. Although rebounds were not tracked in college basketball until the 1953–54 season, it was estimated in 1978 that Bolger may have averaged 17 rebounds per game during his collegiate career.\nGeorgetown would not appear in a post-season tournament again until the 1969-70 team played in the 1970 NIT.\nRoster.\nSources\nRankings.\nSource\nThe 1952–53 squad was ranked 20th in the Associated Press Poll on January 13, 1953. Although only ranked for a week, it was the first team in Georgetown men's basketball history to be ranked in the poll. No Georgetown men's team would be ranked in the AP Poll again until the 1977-78 season.\nThe 1952–53 team was not ranked in the Coaches' Poll at any time.\n1952–53 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

Schmidt and his Illini won their first ten games of the season with the single biggest win occurring December 21, 1968, as they stopped the Houston Cougars' 60 game home winning streak, 97–84. After the win, the Illini, just two days short of two years after the original \"Slush Fund\" announcement, appeared to be back in their prime. During the season the Illini defeated a total of 4 top 20 teams, including a tenth ranked Ohio State in February. Like so many years before, the Illini's only losses came at the hands of the competition provided by the other teams within the Big Ten Conference. The team completed the season with only 5 losses, all coming within the league. The final totals were 19 wins overall with 9 of those wins coming within the conference. The team was led in scoring for the season by Dave Scholz, Greg Jackson, Mike Price and Jodie Harrison. Scholz would finish his senior season by being named 1st team All-American by the Helms Foundation, 3rd team All-American by the Associated Press and to the Converse honorable mention All-American team. The Fighting Illini would go on to finish the season with a 19-5 overall record and tied for 2nd place in the conference with a 9–5 record.\nThe 1968-69 team's starting lineup included Scholz and Fred Miller at the forward spots, Price and Harrison as guards and Jackson at center.\nSchedule.\n \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season\n "

        "title": "1951–52 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1951–52 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1951–52 NCAA college basketball season. Francis \"Buddy\" O'Grady coached it in his third and final season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 15-10 and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1951–52 team was the first to play its home games at McDonough Gymnasium, marking the first time the Georgetown men's basketball team played on campus since the 1926-27 team used Ryan Gymnasium as its home court. It played its first game at McDonough on December 7, 1951 – the day before a ribbon-cutting ceremony officially opened the new gymnasium – against Fordham. Although the Hoyas lost the game, the 1951–52 team went on to post an 11-1 home record during McDonough's inaugural season – the first of 29 winning home records during the 30 seasons Georgetown played its home games there.\nJunior center Bill Bolger had a standout year. Playing in all 25 games, he scored in double figures 20 times, including 25 against Dayton and 29 against Wake Forest. His late-season 38 points against Mount St. Mary's on February 27, 1952, set a new Georgetown single-game scoring record. He scored 435 points during the year – also a school record – and his 17.4 points per game was the highest average by a Georgetown player in 34 years.\nJunior guard Barry Sullivan was the team's point guard and other big scoring threat, and he and Bolger averaged a combined 32 points per game. Playing in 22 games, Sullivan himself led the team in scoring in ten of them, with a 26-point game against Princeton and 25 each against Pittsburgh and George Washington. He recovered from late-season injuries to average 21 points per game in the last two games of the season, and he made the winning basket in Georgetown's 72-70 defeat of George Washington in the final game of the year. Sullivan left school at the end of the year for two years of United States Army service in Korea during the Korean War and did not return to Georgetown, instead later completing his undergraduate studies at Columbia.\nJunior center Hugh Beins averaged 8.7 points per game for the second straight season, appearing in all 25 games and scoring in double figures 10 times. His most notable performances were a 15-point game against Catholic in which Georgetown broke a three-game losing streak and 12 points in Georgetown's only victory over La Salle between 1948 and 1955.\nSophomore guard Lou Gigante backed up Sullivan this season, but showed his potential for the future, coming off the bench to average 6.2 points per game, highlighted by 21 points against Richmond and 18 against Maryland in back-to-back performances in February 1952. He also demonstrated defensive prowess. He would become the team's starting point guard after Sullivan's departure.\nO'Grady's previous two Georgetown teams had struggled, but the 1951–52 team finished with a record of 15-10, his most successful team and the highest win total for a Hoya team between the 1946-47 and 1963-64 seasons. Although it was not invited to a post-season tournament, its performance and the team's move to an on-campus venue for its home games combined to create a sense of optimism in and around the program about its prospects for the future. Despite this, O'Grady resigned at the end of the season, departing with an overall record of 35-36, one winning season, and no post-season tournament appearances during his three-year tenure.\nThe 1951–52 team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Top 30 in the Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSources\n1951–52 schedule and results.\nIt had been a common practice for many years for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, and the March 2, 1952, game against the New York Athletic Club therefore counted as part of Georgetown's won-loss record for 1951–52. Later in 1952, however, after the end of the season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records. Although Georgetown scheduled games against the New York Athletic Club during the regular season up until the 1961-62 season, those after the 1951–52 season were only exhibition games. The March 2, 1952, game thus became the last one against a non-collegiate opponent to count as part of Georgetown's regular season.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "Balochistan cricket team",
        "text": "Balochistan cricket team was a domestic cricket team in Pakistan representing Balochistan province. It competed in domestic first-class, List A and T20 cricket competitions, namely the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan Cup and National T20 Cup. The team was operated by the Balochistan Cricket Association.\nHistory.\nBefore 2019.\nThe Balochistan team was founded in 1954 and played its inaugural season in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in 1954. In 1954-55 Balochistan played one match in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, losing to Sind by 53 runs at the Racecourse Ground, Quetta. They were captained by Athar Khan, who made 36 and 57 and took two wickets. A combined Railways and Balochistan team played the MCC in Multan in 1955–56, losing by an innings. None of the team had played for Balochistan in the 1954-55 match.\nEach season from 1972–73 to 1978-79 (except for 1975-76 when they conceded without playing) Balochistan played one match in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy. They lost all six matches, five of them by an innings and the other by 259 runs. They were dismissed for under 100 seven times. Their lowest total was 53 (followed by 77 in the second innings) against National Bank of Pakistan (476 for 6 declared) in 1974–75. They dismissed their opponents only once. In 1973-74 they conceded a total of 951 for 6 declared to Sind, Aftab Baloch scoring 428. He made 200 not out for National Bank against Balochistan in 1974–75, giving him a career average of 628.00 against Balochistan. Sind's victory margin in the 1973-74 match, an innings and 575 runs, is one of the highest in the history of first-class cricket. Shahid Fawad was Balochistan's most successful batsman in this period. He played four matches, scoring 32 not out (top score) and 25 (top score) in 1972–73, and 33 (second-top score) and 94 (top score, and Baluchistan's top score in the 1970s) against Sind in 1978–79. In 1978-79 a \"North West Frontier Province and Balochistan\" team played the touring Indians in a drawn first-class match in Peshawar. The team actually included no players from Balochistan teams or from Balochistan province.\nSince 2019.\nA new Balochistan team was one of the six teams introduced as a part of the restructure of domestic cricket announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on 31 August 2019.\nStructure.\nIn 2019, domestic cricket in Pakistan was reorganised into six regional teams (on provincial lines). A three tier bottom-up system is in operation with the Tier 1 teams participating in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (First Class), Pakistan Cup (List A) and National T20 Cup (Regional T20). The Tier 2 teams participate in the City Cricket Association Tournament whilst the Tier 3 teams participate in various local tournaments as both tiers feed players to the Tier 1 team. \nSeason summaries.\n2019/20 Season.\nBalochistan finished in sixth and second place respectively in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and National T20 Cup. The Pakistan Cup was cancelled this season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2020/21 Season.\nThe team finished in fourth, sixth and sixth place respectively, in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan Cup and the National T20 Cup."

        "title": "2014 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2014 tennis season officially began on 30 December 2013 with the start of the 2014 Brisbane International. This season was a resurgent season for Federer after a poor 2013 season. Before the start of the season Federer appointed Stefan Edberg as his coach and he also changed racquets for the first time, moving on from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to a 97 square inch frame. Federer reached a total of 11 finals, the most since his 2007 season. One of those finals included the Wimbledon final, his first major final since he won Wimbledon in 2012. After winning Shanghai, Federer returned to No. 2 in the world for the first time since May 2013. He also won the Davis Cup for the first time. Federer ended the year at No. 2 with 5 titles and with the most match wins since 2006.\nYear summary.\nAustralian Open and early hard court season.\nBrisbane International.\nFederer opened his season at the Brisbane International in Brisbane. His first match was in the second round against Jarkko Nieminen of Finland. Though Nieminen challenged Federer in the first set with some aggressive play, Federer ultimately won the first set and went on to win the next set, and the match, handily, continuing his undefeated record against Nieminen. He next played Marinko Matosevic of Australia in the quarterfinals and swept him in straight sets under an hour, allowing only two games to Matosevic. Federer next played Jérémy Chardy of France, whom he had defeated in doubles earlier in the tournament, for the first time in singles in the semifinals. Federer won the first set after breaking Chardy, but Chardy matched Federer in the second set, forcing a tiebreak during which Chardy pulled away from Federer to even the match. The third set looked to be close, but Federer found a break near the end of the set and closed out the match in just under two hours. Lleyton Hewitt won in the final against Federer.\nAustralian Open.\nFederer's next contest was the men's singles event of the 2014 Australian Open in Melbourne. His appearance at the 2014 Australian Open marked a record-breaking 57 straight Grand Slam appearances. He finished in the semifinals last year, losing to Andy Murray in five sets. Federer was the sixth seed in the tournament, and began his tournament by playing Australian wildcard James Duckworth in the first round, breaking him four times en route to a straight-sets win. He then played Blaž Kavčič of Slovenia in the second round. Federer swept through the first two sets, but errors in the third set allowed Kavčič to force a tiebreak, which Federer won to close out the match. Federer broke him six times in total and won seven of the last eight points in the tiebreak to win his seventieth match in Melbourne. Federer played Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia in the third round for the first time in six years. He saved five break points and broke Gabashvili's serve five times en route to a straight-sets victory. Federer played Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in the fourth round, and won in straight sets. Federer found breaks in each set, including one at the beginning of the first set, and dictated at the net, using aggressive play to keep Tsonga at bay. With his win, Federer reached his eleventh consecutive Australian Open quarterfinal, and has now reached 41 Grand Slam quarterfinals, tying the all-time record held by Jimmy Connors. Federer faced Andy Murray in the quarter-finals and defeated him in four sets after missing several break opportunities and squandering two match points in the third set tiebreak. Federer lost to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, in straight sets.\nDavis Cup World Group 1R.\nFederer would make a shocking announcement stating that he would participate for Switzerland in the World Group, his first time doing so since 2012. He along with compatriots Stanislas Wawrinka, Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer would help Switzerland defeat Serbia, defeating Ilija Bozoljac in his first round rubber. Federer's win would help Switzerland advance to play Kazakhstan in the Quarterfinals beating Serbia 3–2.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nAfter playing in the Davis Cup Federer took a three-week break and returned to competition at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Federer won his opening match against Benjamin Becker in the opening round with ease, and faced Radek Štěpánek in the second round. After a solid first set by Federer, Štěpánek tied the match after winning the second-set tiebreak. Federer then climbed out of a three-game deficit in the third set, winning five straight games to seal the match. In the quarterfinals, Federer played his first match against Lukáš Rosol of the Czech Republic. After having his serve broken in the first game, he won the next six games to clinch the first set and held his serve in the second to win the match in straight sets in just under an hour. Federer faced defending champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, and dropped the first set to Djokovic. After a rain delay in the second set, Federer converted breaks in the second and third sets against Djokovic and won his first match against Djokovic in 18 months. This was also the first time he had beaten Djokovic after dropping the first set. Federer then played Tomáš Berdych, who had beaten him in the semifinals last year. The two exchanged breaks in the first, but Berdych secured another break and won the first set. In the second set, Berdych broke Federer again, but Federer took advantage of errors on Berdych's part to get two breaks and level the match at one set all. Federer claimed a crucial break in a tighter third set, and held the lead to win in just under two hours. Federer won a record sixth Dubai title and won his 78th career title, surpassing John McEnroe for the third-most titles won in the Open Era. The win also ensured that he would continue his streak of winning at least one title per year since 2001.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nFederer next played at the Indian Wells Masters in Indian Wells. After a bye in the first round, Federer played Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu, and defeated him in straight sets, winning three break points and a second-set tiebreak. He then played Dmitry Tursunov of Russia in the third round. Federer and Tursunov both won two break points against each other, and Tursunov forced tiebreaks in both the first and second sets. Federer, however, won both of the tiebreaks, taking the match in straight sets. He then met Tommy Haas in the fourth round, and won in straight sets, though Haas kept the match close. Federer played Kevin Anderson of South Africa in the quarterfinals. In the first set, Anderson held off Federer on numerous break point opportunities, but Federer broke in the last game of the set to take the lead. Federer then jumped out to a five-game lead in the second set, and won the match in straight sets. Federer then played first-time semifinalist Alexandr Dolgopolov in the semifinals, and raced through the match, winning four break points and allowing Dolgopolov only four games en route to a win in just over an hour. Federer was narrowly defeated in the final by Novak Djokovic in a final set tie-break.\nMiami Open.\nFederer next played the Miami Open in Miami. He played Ivo Karlović in the second round after a bye in the first round. Federer broke Karlović early in the first set and, after holding to take the lead, defeated Karlović in the second-set tiebreak. Federer then cruised into the quarterfinals, beating Thiemo de Bakker and Richard Gasquet both in straight sets. However, in one of the tour's biggest upsets, Kei Nishikori would improve his head-to-head record against Federer to 2–1, beating Federer in three sets. Unfortunately, Nishikori would retire before his semifinal match, most probably sustaining a groin injury during their quarterfinal meeting.\nDavis Cup World Group QF.\nSwitzerland played against Kazakhstan in the quarterfinals. This was the first time Federer had played in the Davis Cup quarterfinals since 2004. Federer defeated Mikhail Kukushkin to equalize the tie at 1-1. Federer and Wawrinka then played doubles but fell in four sets. After Wawrinka brought the Swiss to parity at 2-2, Federer was tasked with winning the first deciding fifth live rubber of his career. Federer led the Swiss to a 3–2 victory by defeating Andrey Golubev in straight sets.\nSpring clay court season and French Open.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nFederer began his clay season with a wildcard entry into the Monte-Carlo Masters. Federer experienced great success during his second and third round meetings against Radek Štěpánek and Lukáš Rosol, defeating both in straight sets. He then defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga from a set down for the first time in his career, in a match where he failed to convert any of his first 15 break points. He ousted world No. 2 and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, ending the Serb's unbeaten run in Masters 1000 tournaments dating back to the 2013 Shanghai Masters. He lost his fourth Monte Carlo final, this time to compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka.\nMadrid Open.\nFederer was seeded 4th, but withdrew from the tournament to be with his pregnant wife, Mirka. On May 6, he announced that they became parents to twins again, this time boys – Leo and Lenny.\nItalian Open.\nFederer next played in Rome at the Italian Open, where he was a three-time finalist, including in 2013. He was seeded 4th.\nHe suffered a shock defeat to Jérémy Chardy in a final-set tiebreaker in the second round, after having match point. The loss was the first time in 2014 that Federer had failed to match or better his result at a tournament compared to the previous season.\nFrench Open.\nFederer started his 2014 French Open campaign with a comfortable straight sets victory over Lukáš Lacko. He followed this up with another straight sets victory over Argentine qualifier Diego Sebastien Schwartzman in the second round. Federer defeated Dimitry Tursunov in the third round in four sets, in their first meeting on a clay court. Federer was upset in the fourth round by Ernest Gulbis, who leveled their head-to-head record with a victory in five sets. The loss snapped Federer's streak of nine straight French Open quarterfinals.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nHalle Open.\nFollowing a first round bye, Federer came from a set down to defeat João Sousa. After receiving a walkover in the quarterfinals, Federer defeated fourth seed Kei Nishikori to reach his ninth singles final at the Halle Open. Federer successfully defended his title and won a record seventh Halle Open singles title, beating Alejandro Falla in the final in two tiebreak sets. It was Federer's 14th grass court title, extending his open era record, and his 79th career singles title.\nWimbledon.\nFederer dispatched Paolo Lorenzi, Gilles Müller, Santiago Giraldo, and Tommy Robredo without dropping a set or losing serve. In doing so, he reached his 42nd major quarterfinal, surpassing the previous all-time record of 41 set by Jimmy Connors. He defeated compatriot Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the first all-Swiss Wimbledon men's quarterfinal in history, then defeated Milos Raonic in a record 35th major semifinal. This extended Federer's record in Wimbledon semi finals to 9–0, and 27–1 in sets. In the final, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in an epic five set match.\nNorth American hard court season and the US Open.\nCanadian Open.\nFederer would participate in this years Canadian Open for the first time since 2011. The two-time champ was seeded second due to Rafael Nadal's injury and would be given a bye into the second round. Federer would have a speedy dispatch of Canadian wildcard Peter Polansky, advancing to the round of sixteen where he defeated Marin Čilić in a three set thriller match. He went on to beat David Ferrer in the quarter-final in three tight sets. In the semi-final, he defeated Lopez easily in straight sets. In his 37th final at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 level Federer was defeated by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and remained one match shy of becoming the first man to win 300 matches at the masters 1000 level.\nCincinnati Masters.\nFederer was seeded second again due to Rafael Nadal's wrist injury. He played against Canadian Vasek Pospisil in the second round, defeating him in three sets. With that win, he became the first man to win 300 matches at the Masters 1000 level. In the third round, he played against Frenchman Gaël Monfils where he defeated him in three sets. In the quarterfinal, he played Andy Murray, beating him in straight sets after recovering from double-break down in the second set. The victory drew Federer even with Murray head-to-head at 11–11. He easily defeated Milos Raonic in the semifinal with a comfortable straight sets victory over the Canadian. In the final, Federer defeated Spain's David Ferrer in three sets to capture his record sixth Cincinnati crown and 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title. It was also his 80th ATP singles title. He also improved to a perfect 6–0 in Cincinnati finals and to a 16–0 head-to-head record against the 32-year-old Ferrer and secured third place in the 2014 US Open Series. Also with the win, Federer qualified for the season-ending championship, securing a return to the ATP World Tour Finals for a record 13th consecutive year.\nUS Open.\nFederer was seeded second, following Rafael Nadal's withdrawal due to a right wrist injury, at Flushing Meadows and was looking to win the title for a record sixth time. He started his bid for an 18th Grand Slam championship crown against Marinko Matosevic with a straight sets victory, his 50th win of the season, and faced off another Australian, Sam Groth, in the second round, where he managed to beat the big-serving player in straight sets despite a few exchanges of breaks. In the third round, he was tested by the Spaniard Marcel Granollers as he dropped the first set of the tournament but was dominant in the following three sets. He battled another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the round of sixteen, defeating him in straight sets. In the quarterfinal, he defeated Frenchman Gaël Monfils, fighting back from a two-set deficit for the ninth time in his career and saving two match points in the fourth set. Federer then fell in straight sets in his semifinal match to a resurgent Marin Čilić, who went on to win the tournament. With the loss, it became the first time since the 2005 Australian Open that neither Federer, Nadal, or Djokovic featured in the final.\nDavis Cup World Group SF.\nSwitzerland played against Italy in the semifinals. This was the first time Federer had played in the Davis Cup semifinals since 2003. Both Federer and Wawrinka won their respective singles rubbers on the first day against Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini in straight sets. Having a 2–0 lead over Italy, Federer elected not to play the doubles rubber where Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli lost in five sets. Federer would secure a place in the Davis Cup final with a straight sets victory over Fabio Fognini. Switzerland will next play against France in the Davis Cup finals in November, hoping to improve upon their best Davis Cup result as Finalists in 1992.\nAsian swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nIn his second round match, Federer beat Argentinian Leonardo Mayer winning in three close sets after being down 2–5 in the third set tiebreak, saving 5 match points, the first two being saved at 4–5 15–40 in the third set, and the other three being saved in the third set tiebreak. He played Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut and defeated him in straight sets in the third round and went on to beat Frenchman Julien Benneteau in the quarterfinal. He played inspired tennis to beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, ending the Serb's 28-match unbeaten run on Chinese soil.

        "text": "The 1976–77 Detroit Titans men's basketball team represented the University of Detroit in the 1976–77 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played at Calihan Hall in Detroit.\nThe Titans were led by head coach Dick Vitale, a former assistant coach at Rutgers University, who came to Detroit in 1973. He had quick success at UD, finishing 17-9 in his first season (1973–74), and began to recruit talent to his rising program, bringing guard Dennis Boyd, guard John Long, forward Terry Tyler and guard Terry Duerod to the Titans program, all of whom would eventually play in the NBA.\nThe 1976-77 featured a 21-game Titans winning streak, starting on December 6, 1976 with a 113-45 win over Oakland University, and the streak featured a win over #8 Arizona 70-68, winning on a Boyd shot as time expired, a road victory, 99-94 over Michigan State in East Lansing, and entered the rankings at #19, winning over St. Bonaventure 78-62 on February 9, 1977. Gaining national attention, the highlight of the season came on February 16, 1977, as #15 Detroit went on the road to then #6 and eventual national champion Marquette. Boyd again performed the last second heroics, as he took the jump shot with two seconds remaining, scoring and giving Detroit a historic 64-63 victory.\nThe Titans would finish the regular season 25-2 and received a bid to the 1977 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament. Detroit defeated Middle Tennessee in the opening round, with a double-double of 29 points and 15 rebounds from Terry Tyler, and would then lose to the Michigan Wolverines 86-81 in the regional semi-finals. The Titans finished with a stellar record of 26-3 and a final # 12 ranking on the season. (A December 1976 loss against Minnesota was subsequently turned into a win, when Minnesota forfeited the game, thus the official record is 26-3 and not 25-4). On the season, Tyler averaged a double-double of 17.4 ppg, 11.0 rpg, Long paced the team's scoring with 20.3 ppg, Duerod contributed 11.3 ppg, Boyd, 10.3 ppg, and forward Ron Bostick added 7.1 ppg.\nVitale would be promoted to Athletic Director at the university after the season, and would leave to coach the Detroit Pistons in the NBA in 1978. Smokey Gaines replaced him as head coach for 1977-78, and led Detroit to a stellar 25-4 record and a #18 ranking with Tyler, Duerod, and Long leading the team, but were denied a NCAA bid and played in the 1978 NIT. The Titans would return to the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, with Duerod and future NBA center Earl Cureton leading the Titans. Detroit lost to Lamar 95-87 in the first round. Detroit finished ranked #20 on the season.\nWith the Pistons, Vitale drafted Long and Tyler in the 1978 NBA draft, Duerod in the 1979 NBA draft and would add Boyd as a free agent in 1978 after he was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz in the 1977 NBA draft. Tyler and Long had extensive careers in the NBA and Duerod won a championship playing for the 1980-81 Boston Celtics. Vitale would be fired by the Pistons and become a prominent college basketball announcer. At a team reunion, Vitale said, \"\"The stories get bigger and better. If you had an opportunity to see these guys play, you were in for an incredible thrill. They were special,\" adding \"We had the Motor City in the palm of our hand. They were rocking and rolling. I'm so proud to say I had the golden opportunity to be your coach.\"\nVitale was inducted in the University of Detroit Athletics Hall of Fame in 1993 alongside Terry Duerod. Terry Tyler and John Long were honored together in 2001."

Poland's Zbigniew Bródka won the gold medal, the Netherlands' Koen Verweij took silver, and Canada's Denny Morrison took the bronze. After Verweij's race in the last pair of the event, it took about half a minute before it was announced that Bródka had beaten Verweij's time by 3 thousandths of a second, which is 4.1 cm, given the finishing speed of Verweij being 49.4 km/h. Measurements in thousandths were only introduced in speed skating after the 2010 Olympics, so this was the closest win in Olympic speed skating history. Two comparably narrow victories had previously been recorded at the Olympics overall. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Silke Kraushaar beat her teammate Barbara Niedernhuber by 0.002 seconds in the Women's luge event, while at the 1972 Summer Olympics Karl Gunnar Larsson beat Tim McKee by 0.002 seconds in the 400 meters individual swimming medley. The latter narrow win in effect brought about a change so that no swimming competition henceforward would have to be decided by a margin less than a hundredth of a second.\nThe gold medal awarded in this event featured a Chelyabinsk meteor fragment to commemorate the first anniversary of this meteor strike.\nQualification.\nA total of forty speed skaters could qualify for this distance, with a maximum of four skaters per country.

        "text": "Tyler Alexander Boyd (born November 15, 1994) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He played college football at Pittsburgh, and was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nBoyd attended Clairton High School in Clairton, Pennsylvania, where he finished his high school football career ranking among the most productive performers in Western Pennsylvania history. He set a WPIAL record with 117 career touchdowns and finished as the fifth-leading rusher in WPIAL annals with 5,755 yards. He played diverse roles (running back, wide receiver, quarterback, defensive back, and punt returner) for Clairton, which went 48–0 in his three years as a starter and 63–1 (.984) in his four varsity seasons and won four WPIAL and four PIAA Class A titles. As a senior, Boyd rushed for 2,584 yards and 43 touchdowns, had 295 yards receiving on just 13 catches and led the WPIAL in scoring with 51 total touchdowns and 345 points. Boyd was selected to play in the Big 33 Football Classic (Western Pennsylvania vs. Eastern Ohio) and was named the game's MVP after accounting for five touchdowns (91-yard kick return, 68-yard halfback option pass, four-yard run and scoring catches of 16 and five yards). Boyd also played basketball at Clairton, helping lead the Bears to the WPIAL Class A title game and the PIAA playoffs as a senior, and was a baseball letterman as well.\nFollowing his senior season, Boyd was selected to play in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio's Alamodome, where he announced his decision to attend the University of Pittsburgh during NBC's live telecast. He was named to the \"Rivals\" 250 (No. 103) and \"ESPN\" 300 (No. 165) national prospect lists. He was rated as the No. 6 overall prospect in the state of Pennsylvania by \"Rivals.com\" and No. 8 by \"Scout.com\", as well as the nation's No. 12 wide receiver according to both.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season (2013).\nIn 2013 as a true freshman, Boyd was the nation's most productive freshman receiver, setting Pitt freshman records for receptions with 85 and receiving yards with 1,174, both of which were previously held by Larry Fitzgerald (who had 69 catches for 1,005 yards in 2002). He had five 100-yard receiving games, topping Fitzgerald's freshman school-record total of four, and also set the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) record for receptions as a freshman, topping the mark held by Clemson's Sammy Watkins (82 catches in 2011).\nBoyd was named ACC Rookie of the Week, 247Sports National True Freshman of the Week, and Athlon Sports National Co-Freshman of the Week for his performance in Pitt's 58–55 win at Duke, where he had eight catches for 154 yards (19.3 avg.) and a career-high three touchdowns. In a 49–27 win against New Mexico, he compiled 134 receiving yards on six catches (22.3 avg.), including a dazzling 34-yard touchdown grab in the back of the end zone on the final play of the first half; he also rushed for a 33-yard score against the Lobos, earning ACC Receiver of the Week and 247Sports National True Freshman of the Week honors for his performance. Boyd was known for making several highlight reel plays because of his hands and awareness for the sideline that helped him being selected All-ACC by the league's media (second team) and coaches (third team) as well as a Freshman All-American by Athlon, CollegeFootballNews.com, Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Phil Steele, \"Sporting News\", 247Sports, and ECAC Offensive Rookie of the Year.

Boyd's receiving yardage against the Falcons set a Pitt bowl record, surpassing the 36-year-old mark of 163 set by Gordon Jones in the 1977 Gator Bowl against Clemson, while his punt return touchdown was Pitt's first since Darrelle Revis had a 73-yarder against West Virginia in 2006. Boyd's postseason performance earned him USA TODAY All-Bowl Team recognition.\nSophomore season (2014).\nIn his second year at Pitt, Boyd made an impact as a wide receiver and return man. He finished the season with 78 catches for 1,261 yards (16.2 avg.) and eight touchdowns. Boyd's 78 catches rank third on Pitt's single-season list, while his 1,261 receiving yards rank fourth. He totaled six 100-yard receiving games on the year, ranked second in the ACC and 17th nationally with an average of 97.0 receiving yards per game and third in the ACC and 32nd nationally with an average of 6.0 receptions per game.

He was honored as the ACC Specialist of the Week after compiling 262 all-purpose yards in a 35–23 win at Miami (FL) on November 29; in that game, Boyd totaled 190 yards on six kick returns (31.7 avg.) and added five receptions for 72 yards (14.4 avg.) with a 12-yard touchdown catch.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nComing out of college, Boyd was projected to be a second round draft pick by the majority of NFL Draft analysts. He was ranked the fifth best wide receiver out of 414 available by NFLDraftScouts.com.\n2016.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals selected Boyd in the second round with the 55th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the seventh wide receiver to be taken that year.\nOn May 16, 2016, the Bengals signed Boyd to a four-year, $4.25 million contract that includes $1.94 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.29 million.\nBoyd entered the regular season as the third receiver on the depth chart behind veterans A.

        "title": "Basketball uniform",
        "text": "A basketball uniform is a type of uniform worn by basketball players. Basketball uniforms consist of a jersey that features the number and typically the last name of the player on the back, as well as shorts and athletic shoes. Within teams, players wear uniforms representing the team colors; the home team usually wears a lighter-colored uniform, while the visiting team wears a darker-colored uniform.\nDifferent basketball leagues have different specifications for the type of uniform that is allowed on the court. Early in the history of the sport, basketball was played in any type of athletic attire, but by the 1900s, special uniforms were developed and marketed to basketball players. The style, cut, and fit of basketball uniforms evolved throughout subsequent decades, often modeled after the general fashion trends of the day.\nHistory.\nJerseys and shorts.\nOriginally, basketball was played in any type of athletic attire, ranging from track suits to football uniforms. The first official basketball uniforms, as displayed in the Spalding catalog of 1901, featured three types of pants: knee-length padded pants, similar to those worn for playing football, as well as shorter pants and knee-length tights. There were two types of suggested jersey, a quarter-length sleeve and a sleeveless version. \nThe long pants later evolved into medium-length shorts in the 1920s, and by the 1930s, the material used for jerseys changed from heavy wool to the lighter polyester and nylon. In the 1970s and 80s, uniforms became tighter-fitting and shorts were shorter, consistent with the overall fashion trends of these two decades. At this time, women's basketball uniforms transitioned from longer-sleeved uniforms to tank-top style jerseys similar to men's basketball uniforms, which more explicitly showed off players' muscle tone.\nIn 1984, Michael Jordan asked for longer shorts and helped popularize the move away from tight, short shorts toward the longer, baggier shorts worn by basketball players today. Throughout the 1990s, basketball uniforms fell under the influence of hip hop culture, with shorts becoming longer and looser-fitting, team colors brighter, and designs more flashy and suggestive of rappers' bling.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, basketball uniforms became even more oversized and loose-fitting; the arm holes in women's basketball jerseys remained smaller than men's, but were wide enough to reveal the players' sports bras.\nSleeved jersey.\nFor the Christmas Day games of 2013, the NBA and its apparel partner Adidas introduced a newly designed sleeved jersey with large team and NBA logos on the front. Marketers for the new uniforms realized that fans were unwilling to wear sleeveless jerseys in their day-to-day life and hoped the new sleeved jerseys would be more popular for everyday wear. However, it was also a \"not-so-well-kept secret that the NBA wanted to implement jersey ads in the years following the introduction of sleeved jerseys\" as the \"sleeves allow more space for potential partners to add their corporate logos to jerseys\" like association football (soccer). After the league deal with Adidas expired and Nike signed on as the new apparel partner, the sleeved jersey did not continue.\nThe sleeved jersey was controversial among players. LeBron James famously ripped the sleeves off during a prime time game against the New York Knicks in 2015, but in the 2016 NBA Finals James convinced his teammates to wear the sleeved jerseys in Game 5 and again in the title-clinching Game 7.\nShoes.\nIn 1903, a special basketball shoe with suction cups to prevent slippage was added to the official basketball uniform demonstrated in the Spalding catalog. Over the decades, different shoe brands and styles were popular as basketball shoes: Chuck Taylor All-Stars and Keds in the 1960s and 1970s; Adidas and Nike leather high-tops in the late 1970s and 1980s; and Air Jordans in the 1990s. \nNow most athletes wear shoes from the brand they are signed with and some even have their own signature shoes. The first person to have their own signature shoe was Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier when he teamed up with Puma in 1973. Other brands that have made signature shoes for players include, Under Armour (with their most popular being with Stephen Curry), Reebok (with their most popular being with Shaquille O'Neal), New Balance(with their most popular being with Kawhi Leonard), and Anta(with their most popular being Klay Thompson).\nAccessories.\nIn the 1970s, Slick Watts and Bill Walton began to wear headbands, which soon became popular with other players. Rick Barry popularized wrist-bands, and other players soon created variations, such as bands that covered their forearms or biceps. These were used to wipe off sweat, or simply worn as fashion statements. In 2001, Allen Iverson popularized the arm sleeve, originally used to help his bursitis in his right elbow.\nWomen's.\nIn the 19th-century what women wore was controlled by men. When they played women wore floor-length wool skirts. In the '20s they introduced a shorter version of the wool-skirts. In the '30s the movement towards baggy button-able shorts. The '40s and '50s were a huge turning point for women's uniform.\nAs production became cheaper the wool uniforms were replaced by more functional polyester and nylon's. During this time belted satin shorts were also progressively being used. \nGoing into the '60s the skirts were starting to disappear and shorts with elastic waistbands were introduced. Finally from 1980 till now women's uniform are now similar to men's. As they began to wear loose longline shorts, and skirts were eliminated entirely.\nModern day.\nUnited States basketball.\nRules and regulations.\nIn professional basketball leagues today, teams playing at home typically wear lighter-colored uniforms than the visiting team. As of the , the NBA has eliminated the distinction between designated \"home\" and \"away\" uniforms. The home team is now allowed to wear any uniform color it chooses, while its opponent may wear any color that sufficiently contrasts with the home team's choice.\nIn the NBA, basketball shorts must fall at least 1 inch above the knee, and T-shirts cannot be worn under the jersey – however, they are permitted in American college basketball. Some NBA and WNBA teams have allowed sponsors' logos to appear on their uniforms.\nMaterial.\nUniforms are made of wicking material designed to absorb sweat and ensure that it evaporates faster. They are the product of a four-year study researching professional basketball players, who identified the need for fewer seams, lighter weight, and faster drying and cooling in their jerseys.\nInternational basketball leagues.\nThe main difference between U.S. basketball uniforms and those of other countries is the appearance of sponsorship iconography; European basketball uniforms are often covered in the logos of their sponsors (similar to association football), while the U.S. uniforms (like other major U.S. pro sports) feature the team wordmark/logo front and center. \nFor the 2017–18 season, some U.S. teams have started putting sponsorship logos on their jerseys on the upper left of the jersey which is a maximum of 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches.\nWomen's.\nWomen's uniforms today are similar to the men's uniform. It is common now to see Lycra compression shorts, sweat-wicking polyester vests, lightweight jerseys and breathable baggy shorts.\nIn the WNBA the women are allowed to chose which styles and fabrics best suits them.

In the EHF Cup, three teams represented Hungary : Dunaferr NK (from the CL), Budapest Bank-FTC-RightPhone and Fehérép Alcoa FKC. First was eliminated in Round 3, the others in the eight-finals. Consequently, only Győri Audi ETO KC played a European Cup's final this season.\nPostseason.\nTeams finished in bottom four positions after the regular season enter the classification round for 9–12 places, where a double round-robin system is used. In addition, they are given bonus points depending on their final position in the regular season: Ninth placed Kiskunhalas got four points, tenth placed Vác received three points, PTE-PEAC got two points and finally, last placed Vasas SC was awarded only one point.

This was the 35th year in the conference's history, but the first as a non-football conference, which officially formed on July 1, 2013. Conference play started on New Year's Eve 2013, and concluded in March with the 2014 Big East Conference men's basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York.\nThe original Big East Conference split effective immediately after the conclusion of the 2013 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The seven schools that did not sponsor FBS football purchased the \"Big East\" name and reorganized as a new Big East, while the FBS schools that had not left for other conferences retained the original Big East charter and are now operating as the American Athletic Conference (The American). Both leagues, however, claim the 1979 founding date of the original Big East as their own founding dates. While both offshoot leagues initially claimed the history of the original conference, that has apparently changed, as the basketball history of the original Big East is now claimed by the current Big East, and The American now considers its basketball history to have begun with the conference split. Cincinnati, Louisville, Rutgers, South Florida, and UConn, the five full members of the original Big East that sponsored FBS football before the split, joined with several new members to reorganize as The American.\nThe nucleus of the conference is the so-called \"Catholic 7\", the members of the original Big East Conference that do not sponsor FBS football, all Catholic institutions: DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Villanova. The seven from the original Big East were joined by Butler and Xavier from the Atlantic 10, and Creighton from the Missouri Valley. The Big East's full membership remained unchanged from the conference's relaunch through the 2019–20 season; the first change to the league's core membership took place on July 1, 2020 when UConn re-joined from The American.\nRegular season.\nConference matrix.\nThis table summarizes the head-to-head results between teams in conference play.

Following a prolonged period of turnover in the conference membership, culminating in a split of the conference along football lines effective in July 2013, the Big East name was assumed by the seven schools of the original Big East that do not sponsor FBS football (a group colloquially called either the \"Basketball 7\" or the \"Catholic 7\"). The FBS schools retained the old Big East's structure and charter and joined with several other schools to form the American Athletic Conference. As part of the deal, the new Big East retained the rights to the conference tournament in New York City, even though The American is the old Big East's legal successor.\nAll-tournament team.\nDave Gavitt Trophy (Most Outstanding Player)"

        "text": "The 1953–54 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1953–54 NCAA college basketball season. Harry \"Buddy\" Jeannette coached them in his second season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 11-18 and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore forward Warren Buehler joined the varsity team as a starter after a year on the freshman team, replacing star Bill Bolger, who had graduated after the previous season. Destined to become the top Georgetown scorer of the 1950s, Buehler got off to a quick start, ending the season as the teams top scorer for the first of two consecutive seasons. Playing in 28 of the seasons 29 games, he scored in double figures 26 times, including 29 points each against Pittsburgh and Duquesne, 30 against Detroit, and a career-high 36 points against Virginia – in a game which Georgetown nonetheless lost when Virginias Buzzy Wilkinson scored 45 points against the Hoyas. By the end of the year, Buehler had scored a Georgetown-record 511 points and averaged 18.2 points per game, second in school history.\nSenior guard and team co-captain Lou Gigante had starred for the team during the two previous seasons, and began another strong season this year, averaging in double figures. During the game against New York University at Madison Square Garden in New York City on January 12, 1954, however, he broke his foot, ending his season and collegiate career. He had averaged 9.2 points per game during his three varsity seasons.\nThe previous season, Georgetown had made its first-ever appearance in the National Invitation Tournament and its first post-season tournament appearance since the 1942-43 team went to the 1943 NCAA Tournament. In sharp contrast, this season was a disappointment: In the face of academic losses and injuries that would plague the Hoyas throughout the last three seasons of Buddy Jeannettes four-year tenure as head coach, – in addition to losing Gigante to an injury, the team lost one of its top scorers at midseason to an academic suspension – the Hoyas finished with a record of 11-18 and had no post-season play. They were not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSources\nAfter senior guard Lou Gigante suffered an injury, senior guard Jim Frisby replaced him on the team. Both wore No. 13 during the season.\n1953–54 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "At the end of each FIFA Women's World Cup final tournament, several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game.\nGolden Ball.\nThe Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup final, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the \"Silver Ball\" and \"Bronze Ball\" awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. \nGolden Boot.\nThe Golden Boot award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. It was introduced as the \"Golden Shoe\" at the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup and renamed to \"Golden Boot\" in 2011.\nIf more than one player finishes the tournament with the same number of goals, the tie goes to the player who has contributed the most assists (with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such). If there is still a tie, the award goes to the player who has played the least amount of time (most goals per minute).\n\"Silver\" and \"Bronze Boots\" are awarded to the second- and third-placed players.\nGolden Glove.\nThe Golden Glove award recognizes the best goalkeeper of the tournament since 2011. In 2003 and 2007, a Best Goalkeeper award was given, and in 1999 two goalkeepers were named to an All-Star Team. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are eligible for the Golden Ball as well.\nFIFA Young Player Award.\nThe FIFA Young Player Award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old. For the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1998. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the Best Young Player of the tournament based on the player's performances throughout the final competition.\nFIFA Fair Play Trophy.\nThe FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.\nPlayer of the Match.\nThe Player of the Match (POTM) award picks the outstanding player in every match of the tournament since 2003. \nWhile the awards from 2003 to 2015 were chosen by the technical study group, from 2019 the winner has been chosen through an online poll on FIFA's website.\nAll-Star Squad.\nOther all-star selections.\nFANtasy All-Star Team.\nThe \"FANtasy All-Star Team\", which was sponsored by MasterCard, featured eleven players decided by a poll on FIFA.com.\nPlayers Who Dared to Shine.\nThe FIFA Technical Study Group announced a list of ten key players of the tournament who \"dared to shine\".\nGoal of the Tournament.\nThe Goal of the Tournament award was awarded for the first time at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nAll-time best goal.\nIn 2003, FIFA.com held a poll for the greatest goal in Women's World Cup history (from 1991 to 1999). \nThe 1991 goal from Michelle Akers-Stahl won the poll.\nThe similar \"15 for 2015\" poll was held from 11 May to 5 June 2015, encompassing the best goals from 1991 to 2011. \nAbby Wambach, who won the Goal of the Tournament in 2011, was chosen."

The show was pulled from Paramount+ on June 27, 2023.\nPlot.\n\"Pig Goat Banana Cricket\" focuses on the titular quartet, a group of anthropomorphic best friends and roommates: Pig, who is obsessed with pickles, Goat, who has musical dreams, Banana, who loves video games and Cricket, who is talented at mad science. The four embark on surreal journeys on their own, which are then interwoven together. The show is set in Boopelite City, a gigantic and whirring metropolis where many of the buildings look like archaic clockworks. The streets are constantly teeming with characters of intensely varied description, and the sidewalks are crammed with anthropomorphic animals, robots, anthropomorphic foods, anthropomorphic sea creatures, and more. The four roommates live in a treehouse, which sits in the middle of the city, surrounded by the forest, the seas and anywhere else the friends could possibly go.\nProduction.\nDeveloped as \"Pig Goat Banana Mantis!\", a pilot directed by the independent animator Nick Cross, the stories were described by Ryan as difficult to write, given their intertwined nature and the 11-minute running time.\nThis process was smoothened by the running time being doubled and the direction from the network being clarified.\nThe two had to adjust to the studio environment, and described their career in comics as preparing them for production. Jones, Milo, and Wilson reprise their roles from the original short. Mantis, who had been previously voiced by James Urbaniak, was renamed Cricket and recast with voice actor Paul Rugg.\nThe animation style tends to go back and forth between hand-drawn animation and flash animation using Toon Boom Harmony software, while the show is animated at Yeson Entertainment studios in South Korea, some episodes are outraced at Ánima Estudios in Mexico.\nThe show was picked up for a second season prior to its premiere.\nRatings for the series were initially favorable. However, ratings began to experience a steep drop season (as an example, the episode \"Mall Ya Later\" only pulled in 0.79 million viewers) and the last episode aired on Nickelodeon, \"It's Time to Slumber Party\", was only viewed by 0.95 million viewers. Only the first season of the show aired on Nickelodeon.\nMove to Nicktoons.\nFollowing the broadcast of \"It's Time to Slumber Party\" on February 26, 2016, Nickelodeon removed the series from its schedule due to low ratings and the status of the show remained in limbo for 7 months until it was announced in September 2016 that the second season of the series would be moved to sister network Nicktoons on September 25, 2016. Season 2 episodes premiered on the Nicktoons network sporadically until May 31, 2017. 3 remaining episodes were first aired in Poland in 2017 and eventually those episodes aired in the United States 1 year later on August 11, 2018.\nBroadcast and reception.\nThe series premiered in Canada on October 10, 2015, on YTV and on October 18, 2015, on the original channel. In Australia and New Zealand, it premiered on Nickelodeon on October 3, 2016, in Asia, debuted on Nickelodeon on February 23, 2018. In the UK and Ireland, it was broadcast on Nicktoons on January 6, 2018. In Arabia, it aired on Nicktoons at launch. It is available in India on the Voot streaming service.\nThe pilot, published by Cross and titled \"Pig Goat Banana Mantis!\", was promoted to a Staff Pick on Vimeo.\nA writer for \"Juxtapoz\" praised the animation, calling it reminiscent for those of \"the \"Ren and Stimpy\" generation\".\nAndrew Wheeler of \"ComicsAlliance\" noted that Ryan's billing as \"J. Ryan\" was likely to separate him from his controversial reputation in the underground comix scene. Heidi MacDonald of the \"Comics Beat\" wrote that it looked \"wonderful\"."

James records that \"they were for the most part white and often wealthy\" and that \"a black man in the Queen's Park was rare and usually anonymous.\" The Queen's Park club was \"the big shot\" of the local cricket on the island, and matches against touring English sides were the mainstay of cricket at the ground. The club also contributed to the growth of cricket on the island, for trial matches were held on weekends while a tour was in progress, and local talent was invited to play."

        "text": "Robert Blake Anderson (born March 24, 1969) is an American football coach and former player who is currently the head coach at Utah State University. Anderson previously served as the head coach at Arkansas State University from 2014 to 2020, the offensive coordinator at the University of North Carolina from 2012 to 2013, and the offensive coordinator, run game coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Southern Mississippi from 2009 to 2011.\nPlaying career.\nAnderson began his playing career as a quarterback and wide receiver at Baylor University from 1987 to 1989, but tore his ACL during practice. After his recovery, he chose to transfer to Sam Houston State University where he played as a wide receiver for the Bearkats from 1989 to 1991. At Sam Houston State, he was named to the Southland Conference All-Academic team as a senior. During his college days, he played in the I formation and Veer offenses popular at the time. Sam Houston State defensive coordinator Mike Lucas told Anderson that he believed he was suited for a coaching role.\nCoaching career.\nEastern New Mexico (1992–1993).\nAnderson got his start from Howard Stearns at the Eastern New Mexico Greyhounds as a graduate assistant in 1992 and received a full-time position there tutoring wide receivers for the Greyhounds in 1993.\nHoward Payne (1994).\nIn 1994, he coached wide receivers for the American Southwest Conference co-champion Howard Payne University Yellow Jackets under head coach Vance Gibson.\nTrinity Valley (1995–1998).\nAnderson joined the Trinity Valley in 1995 as an assistant.

During the 2000 season his rushing attack averaged 148 yards per game which accounted for 56% of the team's offensive production.\nMiddle Tennessee (2002–2004).\nIn 2002 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders coach Andy McCollum hired Anderson to serve as co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach in replacement of Larry Fedora who had left for Florida. At Middle Tennessee he was exposed to variations of the hurry-up offense which dramatically changed his outlook. The Blue Raiders passing offense increased each year under his tenure, improving from 154.0 yards per game in 2002 to 226.7 in 2003 and 267.7 in 2004.

Anderson's offense churned out over 250 yards per game on the ground, making it the #6 ranked rushing offense in the nation. The 2007 Ragin' Cajuns became the Sun Belt's first ever 3,000-yard rushing team.\nSouthern Miss (2008–2011).\nAnderson joined Southern Miss Golden Eagles in 2008 as quarterbacks coach and run game coordinator under new coach Fedora. He mentored record-setting future National Football League quarterback Austin Davis during his freshman and sophomore years and was promoted to offensive coordinator for the 2010 season where the Golden Eagles averaged 36.9 points per game. Anderson was the play-caller during Southern Miss's 12-win season in 2011 including the Conference USA Football Championship Game victory over the previously unbeaten Houston Cougars. Southern Miss capped off the 2011 season with a 24-17 victory over Nevada in the Hawaii Bowl.\nNorth Carolina (2012–2013).\nWhen Fedora left Southern Miss for the North Carolina Tar Heels in 2012 he took Anderson along as his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In his inaugural season with the Tar Heels, Anderson oversaw an offense that produced 485.6 yards per game, setting over 35 school records, and ending the campaign ranked eighth in the nation in scoring. During the 2013 campaign his offense gained 432.4 yards per game.\nArkansas State (2014–2020).\nAnderson was announced as Arkansas State's head coach on December 19, 2013. He became Arkansas State's fifth head coach in five years, replacing Bryan Harsin who had left for Boise State. Arkansas State played in 6 consecutive bowl games and won 2 Sun Belt conference championships under Anderson.\nUtah State (2021–present).\nOn December 12, 2020, Anderson was hired to be the head coach at Utah State University, replacing Gary Andersen.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas but moved to Hubbard, Texas at an early age.

As hosts, China was given the maximum quota of 4, but since they did not compete in any of the qualification events, the spots were reallocated. An extra additional spot was created in the girls' Techno 293 event and given to China. A further 8, 2 in each event, was decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 88 places were allocated based on qualification events, namely the 2013 World Championships and six continental qualification tournaments for each boat. If a country declined a spot or if there were spots that remained unfilled after the qualification event, the quota was reallocated to another nation, with priority going to nations that had not qualified for any sailing events.\nTo be eligible to participate at the Youth Olympics athletes must have been born between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was released by the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee."

        "title": "1963–64 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1963–64 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1963–64 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached them in his fourth season as head coach, but Georgetown's head coaching position paid so little that he could only coach part-time and held a full-time job outside of coaching in order to meet his financial obligations, impairing his ability to recruit players. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 15-10 and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown looked forward to having senior guard Jim Christy, the team's point guard and team captain, and junior forward Jim Barry – perhaps the best player of Georgetown men's basketball's \"Classic Era\" (1943–1972) – together again after their high-scoring performances the previous season, raising hopes that they could lead the team to a postseason tournament berth. Barry, however, was forced to miss the 1963–64 season while recovering from knee surgery.\nSophomore guard Jim Brown joined the varsity team this year after emerging as a top scorer on the freshman team the previous year. He started the season opener, in which his fast-break style of offense helped the Hoyas to beat Maryland by 21 points. Another newcomer to the team, sophomore forward Owen Gillen, scored 14 points and had 10 rebounds in the game.\nFifteen days later, Georgetown began play in the Quaker City Classic at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its first opponent was No.1 Loyola of Chicago. Led by John Egan, Loyola was the defending champion from the 1963 NCAA Tournament, entered the game with a 22-game winning streak, and was a 28-point favorite. Jim Brown's defense kept Egan in check, Jim Christy scored 30 points, and the Hoyas led by 12 points at the half and won the game 69-58. It was Georgetown's first-ever victory over a No. 1-ranked opponent.\nJim Brown had a season-high 14 points against Navy. He went on to finish the season averaging 12.5 points per game and with a school-record 148 assists; he would break that record himself two seasons later.\nIn the Hoyas' next game, eleven days later against La Salle, Jim Christy scored on eight consecutive field goals. Two weeks after that, Christy scored his 1,000th point in a game against New York University and scored on a late-game layup that helped Georgetown to come from behind to beat NYU, pushing the Hoyas' record to 12-8 and renewing hopes that they could secure an invitation to the 1964 National Invitation Tournament. Sophomore forward John \"Jake\" Gibbons, meanwhile, scored 26 points in a game against George Washington. Owen Gillen had a season-high 23 points against Canisius and also had strong performances against Fordham, Boston College, Holy Cross, and Rutgers, finishing the season as the team's leading rebounder.\nDuring a 107–92 Georgetown loss to Boston College at the Roberts Center in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1964, Boston College guard John Austin — a Washington, D.C., native and DeMatha Catholic High School graduate who was the first African American basketball player in Boston College history — scored 49 points, setting a single-game school scoring record for the Eagles as well as the record for points scored against Georgetown by an opponent in a single game. Both records still stood as of 2018.\nFour days later, Jim Christy had an historic game at Maryland on February 25, 1964. He scored 11 of the game's first 16 points and finished with a school-record 44 points, shooting 14-for-19 (73%) from the field and 16-of-18 (89%) from the free-throw line as the Hoyas upset the Terrapins. The win gave Georgetown the so-called \"Big Three\" title for the year among the Washington, D.C., area's three major college men's basketball teams (Georgetown, George Washington, and Maryland). As impressive as a 44-point game was, Christy's record would stand for only a year and two days until Jim Barry scored 46 points in a game in late February 1965.\nThe team played inconsistently most of the season and finished with a record of 15-10 and no postseason play. The 15 wins were the most by a Georgetown team since the 1951-52 team won 15, leaving observers to contemplate whether the 1963–64 team might have made the postseason if forward Jim Barry had been available to play.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nSource\n1963–64 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season"

The regular season began on 31 August 2012 and concluded on 31 March 2013, followed by the classification rounds and the playoff finals.\nDefending champions Győri ETO KC won the regular season with an almost perfect performance: 21 victories on 22 games and only one draw against their rival Ferencvárosi TC, last season's runners-up. This year's final also confronted Győr to Ferencváros, after both teams had easily won their semi-finals against Váci NKSE and Érd NK. Unlike last season's final, Ferencváros did not challenge the eventual champion as Győr won both legs by six and seventeen goals and so became Hungarian champion for the tenth time.\nOverview.\nTeams.\nThis year, twelve teams competed in the championship: eleven clubs from the past season and only one promoted team from the second division, Budapest SE, the winner of the Eastern group. It was the first time that this club had played in the elite. As per the previous edition, the winner of the Western group, Mohácsi TE announced that they didn't want to be promoted.

        "title": "1962–63 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1962–63 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1962–63 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached them in his third season as head coach, but Georgetown's head coaching position paid so little that he could only coach part-time and held a full-time job outside of coaching in order to meet his financial obligations, impairing his ability to recruit players. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 13-13 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nAfter a successful 1961-62 season, Georgetown lost a school-record eight seniors to graduation. The departed players had been responsible for 79.9% of the teams scoring. Only two lettermen returned for 1962-63, and the only starter to return was the point guard, junior guard Jim Christy. In order to complete his roster, O'Keefe had to put five walk-ons on the 1962-63 team and rely on six newcomers in all.\nChristy and sophomore forward Jim Barry – newly arrived on the varsity team after a year on the freshman team, and destined to become perhaps the greatest player of Georgetown mens basketballs \"Classic Era\" (1943-1972) – were the main scoring threats on the team. They scored a combined 1,000 points during the 1962-63 season, and their performance allowed the inexperienced team to avoid a disastrous season in a rebuilding year.\nBarry made his varsity debut in the first game of the season against St. Joseph's and scored 29 points, which remains the school scoring record for a debut game. Through the first eight games, he averaged 16.5 points per game, the best on the team. Despite his efforts, however, the Hoyas returned home with a record of 2-7 after losing both their games in the Motor City Classic in Detroit, Michigan. Barry then began to turn in a lengthy list of high-scoring performances, and Georgetown embarked on a six-game winning streak – the longest Georgetown winning streak since the 1952-53 team opened 6-0 – that pushed its record to 8-7. During the streak, Barry averaged 28.9 points per game, and scored 31 points against Loyola and 41 against Navy.\nThe winning streak ended with Georgetown losing all three games during a tough road trip in which they visited Niagara, Syracuse, and Maryland. Barry averaged 25.7 points per game in the three losses. Coming home with an 8-10 record, the Hoyas began another winning streak, winning five straight to move to 13-10 on the year, with Barry scoring 39 points against Manhattan and 21, 22, 25, and 28 points in the other four wins.\nFor his part, Jim Christy appeared in 24 games and scored in double figures in 22 of them. His top games of the year included 26 points against Maryland, 34 against Holy Cross, and 32 against Rhode Island.\nThe Hoyas closed out the season with three straight losses, but Barry had one more great performance. In the second-to-last game of the year, Georgetown visited La Salle at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 26, 1963. Barry scored 30 points, and Philadelphia-area sportswriters judged it the best performance of the year at the Palestra, exceeding even the accomplishments there of Princetons Bill Bradley and New York Universitys Barry Kramer during the season. Jim Barry ended the season scoring 20 or more points in 16 games and 30 or more points in six games, averaging a school-record 22.8 points per game, fourth among all sophomores in the United States.\nThe team finished with a record of 13-13, the only team that did not have a winning record in O'Keefes six seasons as head coach. However, it was a creditable record against a tough schedule in a rebuilding year that saw them win 11 of their last 17 games.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nSources\n1962–63 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

For that specific objective, the Mexican delegation has landed its hopes on the disciplines of diving, taekwondo, archery, racquetball, basque pelota, and athletics, most specifically in the athletes: Paola Espinosa, Paola Longoria, Alberto Rodríguez, Eder Sánchez, Damián Villa, Yahel Castillo, and Juan René Serrano (flagbearer), who are the strongest possibilities of winning a gold medal in their respective disciplines.\nThe Mexican Olympic Committee (COM) announced that the Mexican delegation would be made by 646 athletes, 279 of them women and 367 men, who will participate in all 36 sports. On September 20, 2011, the COM announced that the Mexican archer Juan René Serrano would be the flagbearer. On a protocolary ceremony held on September 23, 2011, the Mexican president Felipe Calderón made the official handing of the national flag to the archer, encouraging both pan American and parapan American athletes to give their best effort at the games."

        "text": "The 1968–69 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1968–69 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his third season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 12-12 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nDiminutive guard Don Weber joined the team this season after an impressive stint with the freshman team the previous year. He played a fast-break style of offense and scored in double figures four times, including a season-high 22 points against William &amp; Mary.\nAgainst Loyola in the first game of the season, junior center Charlie Adrion had 24 points and 19 rebounds. In the next game, he scored a career-high 40 points against American. Over the next three games after that – against Randolph–Macon, George Washington, and St. John's – he had a combined 91 points and 44 rebounds. Adrion led the team in scoring in nine of the seasons first 10 games, each time scoring in double figures.\nOn February 13, 1969, Adrion scored only seven points against New York University, and against Rutgers two days later he suffered a season-ending knee injury. With Adrion out, senior forward and team captain Jim Supple, who scored in double figures in 18 of the 23 games he appeared in during the season, stepped up his scoring production: He averaged 20 points per game after Adrions injury, led the team in scoring in six of the last seven games of the year, and finished the season averaging 16.5 points per game.\nDespite Supples efforts, the 1968-69 team continued a recent pattern of strong Georgetown starts followed by late-season collapses – the 1964-65 team lost seven of its final 10 games, while in 1966-67 the Hoyas lost eight of their final 11 games – that sank hopes for a berth in a post-season tournament. After going 10-5 in its first 15 games, it lost seven of its last nine to finish with a record of 12-12. During the three seasons from 1966-67 though this season, Georgetown had a combined record of 6-18 in the last eight games of the season, 1-13 on the road.\nThe 1968-69 team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSource\n1968–69 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "Attenborough Cricket Club",
        "text": "Attenborough Cricket Club is an English cricket club sited in the village of Attenborough near the River Trent from Nottingham. The four Saturday teams compete in the Nottinghamshire Premier League and the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League. The club celebrated its centenary in 2005.\nHistory.\nThe official birth of Attenborough Cricket Club is 1905 although they appear in the Notts Cricket Association Handbook of that year as \"Chilwell &amp; Attenborough\". From 1907 to 1914, Attenborough CC stood alone in the Handbook with Percy J Clarke as Secretary and it was he who had attended and became a Committee member of the inaugural meeting of the Notts Cricket Association in 1896.\nTo this day, the Clarke family has been a leading light in Attenborough Cricket Club affairs where Graham Clarke is a Club Life Member.\nOne of the club’s leading early players was Walter Speak who lived in Elm Avenue, Attenborough from 1896 to 1912. His most famous record was taking all ten wickets (10 for 22) in a match against Dixon &amp; Parkers in July, 1910.\nAlong with most village sides, cricket ceased at Attenborough with the advent of the Second World War but it is believed that the famous Hedley Verity appeared in a wartime game, arranged on the village green just before his premature death at the age of 39.\nThe club was officially re-formed in 1955 when the former President Ken Royston began his long association with the club. The present ground on the Village Green was acquired in 1957 through the generosity of local residents and club members. Considerable work since then has made it one of the best in the county, set in beautiful surroundings adjacent to the Attenborough Nature Reserve, with excellent facilities. In 1990, it was awarded first prize in the Ground Development competition organised by the Institute of Groundsmen and the Nottinghamshire Cricket Association. The club opened its second ground in 2007 on the nearby Long Lane Sports Ground and now uses it for Saturday 3rd and 4th XI matches and Youth Section activities.\nThe senior club is established as one of the top county clubs, at present running four Saturday league sides and two Sunday sides. The club celebrated its centenary in 2005 and has since enjoyed significant success both on and off the field. The 1st XI finished 2nd in Division 1A of the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League in that year and followed that up with victory in the Popkess Cup in 2007. In 2008 the 1st XI took this on a stage further by winning Division 1A and achieving promotion to the NCB Premier League or the first time. It also retained the Popkess Cup and was successful in the Champion of Champions match before capping the season off by winning the SNCL Fair Play Award.\nIn 2015 the 1st XI made a return to the Nottinghamshire Premier League having won promotion from the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League the previous year; the team also won the Fair Play Award. A very successful 2014 also saw the 2nd XI remain unbeaten throughout the season and win promotion to the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League Division C.\nIn 2017 the club once again returned to the Nottinghamshire Premier League.\nThe club's youth set-up provides matches, practice and coaching for boys and girls aged from 9 to 17. Several youngsters are currently adding to past successes with youth cricket over 30 years. The club is Clubmark accredited.\nThe continuing improvement throughout the club’s history is testimony to the efforts of a hardworking Committee, a good supporting band of ladies and a number of stalwarts past and present, including the Clarke family, Bill Evans, Michael Hammond, Geoff Gooch and Michael Dandy. Current Honorary Life Members are Michael Hammond, John Mangham, Ian Murray, Shirley Dandy, Mike Evans, Rod Kitching, David Williams, Keith Sperry, John Birkin, Mike Aplin, Nick &amp; Elaine Allcoat, Alison Rees-Jones, Matt Brick, Paul &amp; Jenny Shoemaker and Gordon Brookes from the club. Previous Honorary Life Members include Geoff Gooch, Gaye Clarke, Micky Dandy and Reg Simpson.\nAt the start of 2012 the club, led by Nick Allcoat (chairman) and Paul Shoemaker (vice chairman) embarked on an ambitious \"Inclusion Project\" to redevelop the pavilion and ground such that the club became able to welcome people with disabilities and to enable the changing facilities for males / females and the clubroom / social area be much improved. The improvements to the pavilion that resulted owed much to the huge contribution from club volunteers and supporters from the local business community. The club will always hold a special memory and be indebted to those who gave their time and effort to see the planned building improvements be delivered and result in such an excellent conclusion. "

She did not finish the slalom race after starting the first run.\nCross-country skiing.\nAccording to the final quota allocation released on January 20, 2014, Togo had one athlete in qualification position. Mathilde-Amivi Petitjean was born in Niger to a Togolese mother, which allowed her the opportunity to compete for the country. She was contacted by Togolese Ski Federation in March 2013 via Facebook to compete for the country at the Winter Olympics. Petitjean has lived the majority of her life in Haute-Savoie, France, where she learned to ski.\nPetitjean finished in 68th place in her only race out of 75 competitors, nearly ten minutes behind the winner Justyna Kowalczyk of Poland. Petitjean hopes that her appearance will help to inspire the youth of Africa to participate in winter sports."

        "text": "The 1982 Virginia vs. Chaminade men's basketball game was a college basketball game between the Virginia Cavaliers of the University of Virginia and the Chaminade Silverswords of Chaminade University of Honolulu. The contest was held on December 23, 1982, at the Honolulu International Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Silverswords, then a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) member, defeated the Cavaliers, who were the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) top-ranked team, 77–72. Chaminade's victory over a Virginia team that included three-time national player of the year Ralph Sampson was called college basketball's \"biggest upset\" of all time by multiple publications.\nBackground.\nThe Cavaliers entered the Chaminade game with an 8–0 win–loss record in the 1982–83 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team featured center Ralph Sampson, who had twice been voted national college basketball player of the year; he received similar honors after the 1982–83 season concluded. Along with Sampson, guards Rick Carlisle and Othell Wilson, and forwards Jim Miller, Tim Mullen, and Craig Robinson, were among the Cavaliers' players. The Cavaliers' head coach, Terry Holland, had been in the position since 1974. Earlier in the season, Virginia had won a game on the road against the Duke Blue Devils by a 13-point margin. They had also defeated the Georgetown Hoyas in Landover, Maryland, in what was nicknamed the \"Game of the Decade\". Afterward, Virginia participated in a tournament in Tokyo and played against the Houston Cougars and Utah Utes, winning both games despite the absence of Sampson, who had been suffering from an intestinal virus. The Cavaliers had hoped to schedule a game against the Hawaii Rainbows, but were unsuccessful. They instead decided to play against the Silverswords. At the time of the contest, Virginia was the number one ranked team in men's college basketball.\nChaminade's basketball program was in its eighth season, and was coming off a record of 28–3 in the 1981–82 season. In the past three seasons, the Silverswords had played the Cavaliers twice, losing both times by double digits. Sampson had compiled 30 points and 16 rebounds against the Silverswords in the teams' 1981 game, which Virginia won 75–59. Chaminade head coach Merv Lopes had been with the team since 1977. Four starters from the Silverswords' 1981–82 team were back for the next season. The key contributors for the Silverswords included guards Tim Dunham, Mark Rodrigues, and Mark Wells, forwards Earnest Pettway and Richard Haenisch, and center Tony Randolph. Eight days before the 1982 Virginia game, Chaminade posted its first-ever victory against Hawaii, by a 56–47 margin. On December 21, the Silverswords lost to Wayland Baptist, Chaminade's only defeat in 11 games. While the Silverswords were not included in the same polls as Virginia, they were fourth in the NAIA rankings entering the game against the Cavaliers, which was the highest placement in school history.\nGame summary.\nThe game was held at Honolulu's International Center with 3,383 people in attendance, less than half of the arena's capacity. The opening tip took place at 7:40 Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time. In the opening minutes of the first half, Chaminade controlled the tempo of the game. According to sportswriter Alexander Wolff, who viewed footage of the game, Chaminade did not attempt to hold possession of the ball for long periods on offense, and often sought to advance quickly up the court after Virginia baskets. Michael Wilbon, a writer for \"The Washington Post\" who was in attendance, reported that Chaminade's offense mostly consisted of jump shots away from Virginia's basket. Defensively, the Silverswords focused on guarding their own basket, in an effort to stop Sampson. They attempted to surround Sampson with defenders when he received the basketball; they often used two or three players to guard the Virginia center. Their primary defender against Sampson was Randolph, who gave up in height but had familiarity with Sampson, having faced him in high school.\nChaminade's Randolph opened the scoring with a slam dunk after a short-distance miss by Wells. The Silverswords scored six of the game's first eight points, and continued to hold the advantage as the first half progressed. After seven minutes of play they had a 15–10 lead; Randolph had 10 points during this stretch. At one point they led 19–12, before a Cavaliers scoring run that gave Virginia a 22–21 lead. Despite the run, the Cavaliers had difficulty shooting field goals. Mullen later said, \"I remember us getting like 10 rebounds per possession and missing layups. The ball would not go in.\" At the end of the first half, the Cavaliers and the Silverswords were tied, 43–43.\nThe score remained close early in the second half before Virginia gained the lead. A Ricky Stokes score gave the Cavaliers a seven-point lead with 11:14 remaining. Chaminade responded with a 7–0 scoring run to force a 56–56 tie, before Sampson made a turnaround jump shot to give Virginia the lead back. Immediately after his basket, Silverswords players Dunham and Rodrigues combined on an alley-oop play; Rodrigues passed the basketball to Dunham, who dunked over Sampson. Chaminade forward Richard Haenisch said of the basket, \"After that play, I think we all got the feeling we could actually win.\" With less than six minutes left in the second half, the teams were tied at 62–62. Dunham made a 22-foot jumper to give the Silverswords the lead. The Cavaliers forced another tie at 68–68, only for Wells to make a layup with under two minutes on the game clock. Wells was fouled on the play and earned a three-point play opportunity, but missed his free throw try. Sampson took the rebound for the Cavaliers, who missed two shots from close range during their possession. The Silverswords' Pettway rebounded the second miss and was fouled with 1:15 left. He made two free throws to stretch the Silverswords' lead to four points. Carlisle responded for Virginia with a 15-foot jumper, which cut their deficit in half. Wells converted two free throw attempts after being fouled, before Carlisle scored on another jump shot.\nChaminade held a 74–72 lead with 35 seconds remaining, but Virginia gained possession of the basketball after the Silverswords missed a free throw attempt, which gave the Cavaliers an opportunity to tie the game. However, Virginia was unable to score during the possession; following three missed field goal attempts, Cavaliers player Wilson committed a carrying violation with 10 seconds on the clock. After being fouled by the Cavaliers, Dunham was successful on two free throw attempts, stretching the Silverswords' lead to four points. Wells completed the scoring with another free throw, which made the final score 77–72 in Chaminade's favor.\nChaminade was led by Randolph; in 27 minutes on the court, he recorded 19 points with nine made field goals in 12 attempts, along with 5 rebounds. Dunham added 17 points, while Pettway contributed 13 points and eight rebounds. Nine points and five rebounds were recorded by Haenisch, and Wells had seven points and five assists. For the game, the Silverswords were successful on 28 of their 57 field goal attempts. Virginia made one more basket, but required 14 more shots than Chaminade to do so. For the Cavaliers, Sampson played 38 minutes, scoring 12 points and pulling down 17 rebounds. He had six of Virginia's 25 turnovers in the contest. Carlisle missed 14 of his 21 field goal attempts in the game, while Mullen scored four points.\nAftermath.\nThe result of the game initially was not widely reported in the U.S. media, as it concluded after 3:00 in the morning on the East Coast. The only sportswriter at the contest who was not based in Hawaii was Wilbon, who had been dispatched by the \"Post\" to cover the Aloha Bowl, which featured the University of Maryland; he decided to make a side trip to the Virginia–Chaminade game. In addition, the matchup was not televised. As it drew to a close, Chris Berman and Tom Mees were about to conclude a telecast of \"SportsCenter\" on ESPN. The anchors received the initial report of the final score from a wire machine, then reacted in disbelief. Shortly afterward, a second bulletin confirming the result was given to them. According to Berman, the viewing audience was then informed: \"We can't tell you what happened, but the No. 1 team in college basketball has lost to—we don't even know who they are.\"\n\"Sports Illustrated\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" later identified the game as the greatest upset in the history of college basketball. Author Chuck Klosterman went further, calling the Silverswords' win \"the biggest upset in collegiate sports history\". Chaminade gained increased prominence after the game, which caused the school to cancel a plan to change its name to the University of Honolulu. The Silverswords won their next nine games and reached number one in the NAIA rankings. They finished the 1982–83 season with a record of 34–5, reaching the semifinals of the 1983 NAIA men's basketball tournament before being eliminated by the College of Charleston.\nThe loss knocked Virginia out of the number one spot in the Associated Press (AP) Poll. The Cavaliers ended the season at 29–5, winning 11 of 12 games after playing Chaminade, and received a number one seed in the 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Cavaliers, who were placed in the West region, advanced to the regional final. They fell short of the Final Four, as they lost to number six seed North Carolina State, who had already defeated Virginia in the championship game of the ACC Basketball Tournament and eventually won the national championship. Virginia did not regain the number one ranking in the AP Poll until the 2017–18 Cavaliers reached the position on February 12, 2018. That season's team was ranked first entering the 2018 NCAA Tournament, but became the first NCAA Tournament one-seed to lose against a 16-seed in a 74–54 defeat by UMBC.\nThe Silverswords won further games against Division I teams in future seasons. Chaminade followed up the win over the Cavaliers by beating Louisville in both 1983 and 1984, by scores of 83–72 and 67–65, showing that the Virginia game was not a one-game fluke for Chaminade. The second Louisville win was against a Cardinals team ranked 12th in a national poll. Three days after that game, the Silverswords defeated SMU, the third-ranked team in the country, on a buzzer-beating shot. Chaminade's victory led to the creation of the Maui Invitational Tournament, an annual event in which the Silverswords compete with seven major college teams. As of 2017, Chaminade has won eight games in the Maui Invitational since its creation in 1984; its most recent win was in 2017 versus the California Golden Bears."

        "text": "The 1961–62 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1961–62 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached them in his second season as head coach, but Georgetown's head coaching position paid so little that he could only coach part-time and held a full-time job outside of coaching in order to meet his financial obligations, impairing his ability to recruit players. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. The team finished with a record of 14-9 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore guard Jim Christy joined the team as point guard this season. Early in the season he scored 25 points against VMI in the Richmond Invitational Tournament and was named the tournaments Most Valuable Player. He scored on a layup with five seconds left in overtime to defeat Seton Hall, and he had big games against George Washington and Rhode Island and in an upset of highly regarded Niagara.\nSenior center Bob Sharpenter scored 25 points against Fairfield, had a combined 44 points and 32 rebounds during the two games of the Richmond Invitational, and had 17 points and 13 rebounds against Seton Hall. On February 7, 1962, he had one of the top performances in Georgetown history in the game against St. Joseph's, shooting 16-for-28 from the field to score a Georgetown-record 40 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. Before the season ended, he went on to score 32 points and pull down 11 rebounds in the upset of Niagara, have a 27-point, 22-rebound performance against New York University, and score 30 points and get 18 rebounds against Rhode Island. He led the Hoyas in scoring and rebounding for the season and was named the teams Most Valuable Player.\nA good outside shooter, senior guard Jim Carrino shot 48% from the field for the season, the highest average on the team. He scored a career-high 30 points against Maryland, 22 in the upset of Niagara, and 25 in the season finale against Saint Peter's.\nSenior forward and team captain Paul \"Tag\" Tagliabue missed the December 15, 1961, game against Manhattan at Madison Square Garden in New York City to participate as a finalist in the Rhodes Scholarship competition. He averaged 11.3 points per game, with highs of 18 points against George Washington and 13 rebounds against St. Joseph's. He ended his collegiate career as one of Georgetowns great rebounders, second in history in both number of rebounds and average rebounds per game.\nThe team played a then-record five overtime games during the season, winning four of them. It finished the season with a record of 14-9, the greatest number of wins by a Georgetown men's basketball team since the 1951-52 season, but not enough to earn it an invitation to a post-season tournament. It was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nA school-record eight seniors graduated from the team after the end of this season, including every starter except Jim Christy. The departing players had been responsible for 79.9% of the teams scoring. The next season would be a rebuilding year.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nSenior forward and team captain Paul Tagliabue later became Commissioner of the National Football League.\nSources\n1961–62 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

The Thai team consisted of two athletes, Vanessa Vanakorn and Kanes Sucharitakul, both competing in alpine skiing. This was Thailand's third appearance at a Winter Olympic Games, and their first since 2006, having missed the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nBackground.\nThailand first joined Olympic competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki and have participated in every Summer Olympics since, except the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics. Their first appearance in the Winter Olympic Games came at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Thailand participated in 2006, but missed the 2010 Winter Olympics, making Sochi their third Winter Olympics participation. The only winter sport Thailand had previously competed in was cross-country skiing. The Thai team to Sochi consisted of two athletes, Vanessa Vanakorn and Kanes Sucharitakul, both competing in alpine skiing. Sucharitakul was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nAccording to the final quota allocation released on January 20, 2014, Thailand had two athletes (one male and one female) in qualification position. Thailand had two male athletes that met the standard, and chose to send the one that was born in Thailand and had qualified for more events. Kanes Sucharitakul was 21 years old at the time of the Sochi Olympics. On 19 February Sucharitakul participated in the giant slalom, he competed his runs in 1 minute and 37.82 seconds and 1 minute and 37.24 seconds. His total time of 3 minutes and 15 seconds put him in 65th position, out of 72 athletes who completed the race. On 22 February he did not complete the first run of the slalom race.\nVanessa Vanakorn, a classical violinist who performs under the name Vanessa-Mae, and whose father is from Thailand, also competed for the country under her father's last name. She was 35 years old at the time of these Games. Vanakorn qualified on the last day of qualification by her results in a series of four races in Slovenia. The International Ski Federation (FIS) subsequently determined that those races were rigged to give her the number of FIS points necessary to be able to take part in Sochi, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned the finding of the FIS, in part because it could not find to the CAS' satisfaction \"evidence of any manipulation by Vanessa Vanakorn herself\". The International Olympic Committee (IOC) subsequently confirmed Vanessa Vanakorn's Olympic result and on 24 February 2016, the FIS issued a public apology to Vanessa Vanakorn and made an \"appropriate payment\" to her for damages. On 18 February, Vanakorn competed in her only race, the giant slalom. She posted run times of 1 minute and 44.86 seconds and 1 minute and 42.11 seconds. Her combined time of 3 minutes and 26.97 seconds saw her finish in 67th position, last among the finishers, although 22 other athletes failed to complete the race. Her time was over 50 seconds behind the winner Tina Maze of Slovenia."

        "text": "Three athletes from India qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia held between 7 and 23 February 2014. They initially entered the competition as Independent Olympic Participants due to the ongoing suspension of India's national olympic committee (NOC), the Indian Olympic Association since 2012. However, on 11 February 2014, the IOC reinstated India's NOC, allowing two athletes with pending events to represent India at the 2014 Winter Olympics instead. Shiva Keshavan, participating in Luge, was thus the only independent athlete at 2014 Winter Olympics.\nBackground.\nIndia's National Olympic Committee, the Indian Olympic Association, was suspended by the International Olympic Committee due to government interference in the autonomy of the country's NOC in December 2012. It was announced on 31 December 2013 that India would be competing under the Olympic flag in Sochi. Elections by the Indian Olympic Association were scheduled two days after the opening ceremony, which would not provide enough time for the suspension to be lifted. The IOC ultimately reinstated the Indian Olympic Association on 11 February after Narayana Ramachandran, the president of the World Squash Federation, was voted in as its new president. While Shiva Keshavan had already competed in his events as an Independent Olympic Participant, two athletes who still had their events pending represented India at the 2014 Winter Olympics; this was the first time such a reinstatement of a NOC occurred as an Olympic Games were underway.\nLuge.\nIndia qualified a place in the men's singles when Shiva Keshavan finished in the top 40 (with a maximum of three per nation qualifying) during the 2013–14 Luge World Cup. As the event was held during the first weekend of the Games, Keshavan had to compete as an Independent Olympic Participant. Keshavan finished the four runs of the event in 37th position out of 39, marking his worst ever performance at the Winter Olympics.\nExternal links.\nIndependent Olympic participants\nIndia"

        "title": "FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification is the process that a national basketball team goes through to qualify for the FIBA Basketball World Cup finals. Qualifiers are held within four FIBA continental zones Africa, Americas, Europe, and Asia-Oceania play in a combined Asia-Pacific region to qualify for the FIBA Basketball World Cup, which are organized by their respective confederations. One extra berth is allocated for the specific continental zone that hosts the event, in addition to the set berths allotted for the region.\nThe hosts of the World Cup receive an automatic berth. Unlike in previous editions results from the prior Summer Olympics and continental championships are not taken into account. Until 2014, the winners of the Summer Olympics and continental championships also received an automatic berth, but starting from the 2019 World Cup this is no longer the case. \nHistory.\nSummary.\n\"+W\" are invited teams (wild cards), \"+O\" are for teams that qualified via the Summer Olympics, \"+C\" are the defending world champions, and \"+H\" are for hosts.\nOlympic, European and South American automatic berths.\nBefore the creation of the first FIBA zones, qualifying for the FIBA World Championship, the original name of the FIBA Basketball World Cup, was via the Summer Olympics, regional championships and by invitation, although some teams were not able to compete due to political reasons. Teams from North and Central America, which did not have a regional championship until the establishment of the Centrobasket in 1965, Asia until the establishment of the Asian Championship in 1960, and Africa until the foundation of the African Championship in 1962, could either qualify via the Olympics or by invitation. The Olympics used the Pan American Games as a qualifying tournament, serving as the first qualifying tournament for North and Central American teams.\nIn the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Argentina, the top three teams from the 1948 Summer Olympics, the top three teams from 1949 South American Basketball Championship, the EuroBasket 1949 champion and the top two teams from a subsequent European qualifying tournament, and two invitees and Asia were supposed to compete. , the South American champion, were refused visas, the Asian teams refused to make the long trip to Argentina, and withdrew for financial reasons.\nIn the 1954 FIBA World Championship in Brazil, the top four teams in the 1953 South American Basketball Championship, the top 3 teams in EuroBasket 1953 and one invitee from the Americas () and two invitees from Asia ( and the ) were supposed to participate; however, the Brazilian government refused entry on teams from Communist countries, except .\nThe 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile saw the Olympic champion, the top two teams from 1955 South American Basketball Championship and EuroBasket 1957, and seven invited teams. In the 1963 FIBA World Championship, the Olympic champion and the top three teams from 1961 South American Basketball Championship and EuroBasket 1961 were given places, plus five invited teams, four from the Americas and one from Asia. The Philippines was supposed to host, and was to be Asia's representative, but were suspended and removed hosting rights by FIBA after the government refused to issue visas to teams from Communist countries. FIBA awarded the World Championship to Brazil, and the Asian berth was instead given to .\nAfrican, Asian, Central American and Oceanian automatic berths.\nBy the 1967 FIBA World Championship in Uruguay, the Summer Olympics and the continental championships in Europe, Central America, South America and Asia became established as qualifying tournaments. The two North American nations, the United States and Canada, could still only qualify via the Olympics or via invitation; Mexico participated via the Centrobasket, which it hosted the inaugural tournament. In the next tournament in the 1970 FIBA World Championship in Yugoslavia, the African champion was given an automatic berth, and regions which didn't have qualifying tournaments, Oceania and North America, were granted invitations. In the 1974 FIBA World Championship, the reigning world champions replaced the Summer Olympics champions on the automatic berth, with the Oceanian champion also qualifying outright; the two North American teams, and the were regularly invited as there was no way for them to enter the competition with the Olympics no longer serving as a qualifying tournament. The Summer Olympics returned as an outright qualifying tournament in 1982 when the top three Olympic teams were given berths, but these were again removed in 1986, when two invited teams participated.\nAmericas automatic berths.\nIn the first world championship in the open era where professionals were allowed to compete in the 1990 FIBA World Championship in Argentina, the field was reduced to sixteen, and the FIBA Americas Championship were first used to determine the qualifiers from the entire Americas, instead of the separate then-continental championships in Central and South America; these then became qualification tournaments to the Americas championship. This also allowed the USA and Canada to compete in a qualifying tournament other than the Olympics; those two teams are automatically included and do not have to participate in qualifying. In addition, the defending world or Olympic champions weren't given automatic berths, nor where there invited teams. The Summer Olympics became a qualifying tournament again in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in Canada. This setup continued until the 2002 FIBA World Championship in the USA which were also the Olympic champions; the supposed berth for the Olympic champions were instead given to Americas, the USA's home zone.\nWild card berths.\nIn the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan that saw the field expand to 24 teams, with four invited teams popularly called as \"wild cards\" were invited by FIBA. This setup will last until 2014, when FIBA announced that they were renaming the competition as the \"FIBA Basketball World Cup\".\nHome and away qualification.\nIn 2012, FIBA announced that the supposed 2018 World Cup would be moved to 2019, the field would expand to 32 teams, and that a new qualification format will be used. Qualification for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup and all succeeding World Cups will see one path of qualification for teams from Asia and Oceania, that the home-and-away system will be used, and that the continental championships will be held quadrennially instead of biennially; and those would no longer be used as qualification tournaments.\nParticipation.\nThese are the number of teams that participated in all levels of qualification for the World Cup since 2006:\nKey to map:\nCurrent format.\nQualification format to be used starting at the 2019 FIBA World Cup:\nFirst appearance in qualification.\nThe figures below show the first instance a team qualified to the final qualifying tournament (i.e. continental championship). Countries that had not appeared here may have earlier participated in earlier stages of qualification tournaments. "

        "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers women's lacrosse team is an NCAA Division I college lacrosse team representing the University of Virginia as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They play their home games at Klöckner Stadium in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nHistory.\nIn its over 40-year history, Virginia has only had four head coaches: Linda Southworth, Jane Miller, Julie Myers, and Sonia LaMonica\nLinda Southworth era (1976–83).\nLinda Southworth was hired as the Cavaliers' first head coach in 1975, with the first team fielded the following year. She had been a part of Longwood's first women's lacrosse team, then taught and coached at Huguenot High School, before taking the position at Virginia. In her eight-year tenure, the team went 58–37–5. She guided the program into the NCAA era, and during her time in Charlottesville, she also coached field hockey at UVa and started a local girls' middle school lacrosse league. After leaving the University of Virginia, she became the Athletics Director at St. Catherine's School in Richmond. In 2005 she was inducted into the Virginia Lacrosse Hall of Fame. As of 2012, she is still coaching girls' JV lacrosse at St. Catherine's.\nJane Miller era (1984–95).\nIn 1984, Jane Miller was hired as the program's second coach. Miller was a 1973 graduate of Northeastern University, where she had been a standout in basketball, field hockey, and lacrosse. In her twelve seasons, Miller compiled a record of 145–44, including six final fours and national championships in 1991 and 1993. She was awarded the IWLCA Coach of the Year in 1991 for her efforts in bringing home the program's first national title. She left after the 1995 season to accept a full-time administrative role. The next year, she was inducted into the Virginia Lacrosse Hall of Fame, and was also voted into the U.S. Lacrosse National Hall of Fame in 2003. Since 2001, she has served as the senior associate director of athletics for programs and senior woman administrator. In 2014 she was appointed to the NCAA Division I Board of Directors.\nJulie Myers era (1996–2023).\nJulie Myers, a 1990 graduate of Virginia, returned to her alma mater six years later to assume the head coaching position. She has led the Cavaliers to a postseason berth in all 22 of her seasons in Charlottesville, a feat unmatched by any other coach at the Division I level. Virginia's 22 straight appearances are also the second-most behind Maryland. As of the conclusion of the 2018 season, Myers has led the Cavs to a 30–22 postseason record and the 2004 national title, in addition to championship game appearances in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007. The Cavaliers have been ranked in the IWLCA Coaches' Poll for all but four weeks of Myers' tenure.

Huguely was arrested later that day and charged with second-degree murder. He was sentenced to prison in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in 2029. In September 2010, Love's family created the One Love Foundation, which aims to raise awareness about relationship violence.\nAwards.\nReference:\nACC awards.\nReference:\nIndividual career records.\nReference:\nPostseason Results.\nThe Cavaliers have appeared in 35 NCAA tournaments.

        "text": "The 1975–76 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1975–76 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his fourth season as head coach. An independent, Georgetown played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 21-7. The team won the 1976 ECAC South Region tournament and appeared in the 1976 NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year, losing in the first round to Arizona.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore center Ed Hopkins had required surgery for a serious leg injury during the summer of 1975, and his recovery hampered him this season, although he appeared in 26 of Georgetowns 28 games. With Hopkins limited, and despite suffering from back problems, senior center and team co-captain Merlin Wilson started all 28 games, shot 57 percent from the field, and averaged 11.1 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. He had a 22-point, 20-rebound performance against Upsala in the season opener, the last of eight 20-rebound games during his collegiate career, by far a school record no one has come close to since.\nAlthough he averaged only 13 shots per game, sophomore guard Derrick Jackson became the team's leading scorer this season, the first of three seasons he achieved this. He averaged 17 points per game and scored a career-high 28 points against Penn State. Over the season as a whole, he shot 195-for-399 (48.9%) from the field and scored 406 points; he would post almost identical statistics the following season.\nFreshman forward Al Dutch started all 28 games and had a strong season, scoring 20 or more points in six games. He scored 27 points in Georgetowns overtime upset of No. 12-ranked St. John's and 28 points against Navy. Freshman guard Steve Martin gave a glimpse of his future potential when he shot 6-for-6 from the field and scored 14 points in a game against Southern Connecticut State. Senior forward Bill Lynn, meanwhile, scored 22 points against Southern Connecticut State and shot 53 percent from the field for the season, specializing in outside jump shots. Junior forward Larry Long missed the first 11 games of the season because of academic issues, but returned to the team to shoot 42% from the field and average 7.4 points per game for the year.\nAlthough retaining its status as an independent, Georgetown was in its second season as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), a loosely organized sports federation that held four regional post-season Division I basketball tournaments in 1976 for independent Eastern colleges and universities similar to the end-of-season conference tournaments held by conventional college basketball conferences, with each tournament winner receiving an at-large bid to the 1976 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. For the second straight year, the Hoyas competed in the ECAC South Region tournament, which they had won the previous year. Derrick Jackson scored 22 points as Georgetown defeated Villanova in the semifinal.\nIn the final on March 6, 1976, the Hoyas faced George Washington, which was on the brink of reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1961. George Washington had defeated Georgetown in eight of the last 11 meetings between the schools, including a regular-season game only nine days earlier. Georgetown's starters scored only 21 points, but the Hoyas' bench scored 44 and the Hoyas won 68–63 to take the ECAC South Region championship for the second consecutive season and secure a second-straight NCAA Tournament bid. The Colonials did not come as close to an NCAA Tournament appearance again until they received a bid to the 1993 tournament. Georgetown senior guard and team co-captain Jonathan Smith, a former team scoring leader whose numbers had declined this season and who had averaged only 5.6 points per game during the regular season, scored 20 points against Villanova and 16 against George Washington during the ECAC South Region Tournament.\nPlaying in the NCAA Tournament's West Region, Georgetown lost in the first round to 15th-ranked Arizona. Derrick Jackson again scored 22 points during the game, while Jonathan Smith scored 20.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSource\nSophomore guard Craig Esherick would later serve as an assistant coach for the Hoyas from 1982 to 1999 and as head coach from 1999 to 2004. Sophomore guard Mike Riley would later serve as a Hoya assistant coach from 1982 to 2004.\n1975–76 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| ECAC South Region tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "1974–75 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1974–75 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1974–75 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his third season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent that played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 18-10. The team won the 1975 ECAC South Region tournament and appeared in the 1975 NCAA tournament – the Hoyass first appearance in that tournament since 1943 – and lost to Central Michigan in the first round.\nSeason recap.\nThe team struggled during the first half of the season, and a six-game losing streak caused its record to fall to 7-8 by the end of January 1975. Some people called for Thompson to be fired. A contributing factor in the Hoyas woes was the performance of junior center Merlin Wilson, who also received criticism; in contrast to his first two years with the team, he seemed sluggish when running, did not pull down as many rebounds as he once had, and suffered a scoring slump. He turned out to have a painful, undiagnosed back problem. His play remained uneven all season but improved in later games, including 17 points and 13 rebounds against St. Joseph's and 23 rebounds against Saint Francis, and he finished the year as Georgetowns top rebounder. Sophomore forward Larry Long, meanwhile, averaged 9.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game despite suffering ankle, thigh, and knee injuries. Freshman power forward Ed Hopkins started every game, averaged 9.8 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, and shot 49% from the field.\nFreshmen Derrick Jackson and Mike Riley alternated at guard, and Jackson showed signs of the scoring threat that he would become, averaging 10.6 points per game and scoring a season-high 19 against St. John's on January 4, 1975, in Georgetowns first road victory over the Redmen since December 1947. Junior guard Jonathan Smith, meanwhile, scored 20 or more points in four of the first eight games of the season; although he suffered a broken finger in a December 1974 game, he nonetheless was Georgetowns top scorer for a second season.\nAlthough retaining its status as an independent, Georgetown enhanced its chances for a berth in the NCAA tournament this season by joining the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), a loosely organized sports federation that in 1975 for the first time held regional post-season Division I basketball tournaments – four in all – for independent Eastern colleges and universities similar to the end-of-season conference tournaments held by conventional college basketball conferences, with each tournament winner receiving an at-large bid to the 1975 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Georgetown participated in the ECAC South Region tournament. The first game was a semifinal match-up against George Washington, a team which had defeated Georgetown during the regular season and in seven of the last nine meetings between the schools. Derrick Jackson scored 18 points as the Hoyas prevailed this time, defeating the Colonials 66-59 to advance to the final.\nIn the ECAC South final, Georgetown faced West Virginia on the Mountaineers home court at the WVU Coliseum before a crowd of some 14,000 West Virginia fans and a few hundred Hoya supporters. Jonathan Smith scored 10 points in the game and West Virginia guard Bob Huggins scored 14. The Mountaineers led 32-31 at halftime and appeared to have an advantage when Merlin Wilson and Larry Long both fouled out in the second half. With 54 seconds left in the game and West Virginia leading 61-58, Derrick Jackson scored to close to 61-60. The Mountaineers tried to preserve the win by running out the clock, but Georgetowns Mike Riley fouled West Virginias Ernie Hall with 10 seconds left to stop the clock. Hall came to the free-throw line to shoot a one-anad-one, and missed his first shot. Ed Hopkins – who shot a career-low 25% (4-for-16) but pulled down 12 rebounds – grabbed the rebound and passed it to junior guard Bill Thomas, who threw a long, cross court pass to Jackson with five seconds left. Jackson promptly scored on an 18-foot (5.5-meter) shot with two seconds left, silencing the crowd – except for the handful of Georgetown fans celebrating in the stands – and giving Georgetown a 62-61 victory. Jacksons shot became known in Georgetown men's basketball history as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World,\" because the unlikely victory secured the Hoyas first NCAA tournament berth since the 1942-43 season and began the schools pattern of regular appearances in the tournament in the years to come.\nThe 1974-75 squad was only the second team in Georgetown mens basketball history to play in the NCAA Tournament, and it was the first Georgetown men's basketball team to be invited to either the NCAA Tournament or the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) since the 1969-70 team's appearance in the 1970 NIT. Playing in the tournaments Mideast Region, the Hoyas met Central Michigan in the first round. Junior Hoya forward Bill Lynn scored 14 points and had 11 rebounds in the game. With six seconds left to play, the score was tied 75-75 when a held ball forced a jump ball. Georgetowns Ed Hopkins grabbed the tip and passed it to Derrick Jackson, who threw it to Jonathan Smith. Smith dribbled toward the basket and put up a long shot as time expired that missed. Central Michigan guard Leonard Drake undercut Smith as he shot, but an official off the ball called an offensive foul on Smith. Drake made both of his resulting free throws with no time remaining to give the Chippewas a 77-75 win and knock Georgetown out of the tournament. John Thompson objected strenuously, and game films later supported the view that it was Drake who had fouled Smith in the act of shooting.\nOn November 30, 1974, Rich Chvotkin debuted as the radio voice of the Hoyas with a broadcast on WOOK-AM of the season opener against Upsala at McDonough Gymnasium, giving Georgetown its first regular radio coverage. Chvotkin would go on to broadcast every Georgetown men's basketball game since except for most of those of the 1990-1991 season, when he was mobilized for six months of United States Army Reserve service during the Gulf War after calling only the first four games of that season.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSource\nFreshman guard Craig Esherick would later serve as an assistant coach for the Hoyas from 1982 to 1999 and as head coach from 1999 to 2004. Freshman guard Mike Riley would later serve as a Hoya assistant coach from 1982 to 2004.\n1974–75 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| ECAC South Region tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The closing ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 23 February 2014 from 20:14 to 22:25 MSK () at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Russia. It was designed to show Russian culture, through a European perspective, and featured performances by Yuri Bashmet, Valery Gergiev, Denis Matsuev, Hibla Gerzmava, and Tatiana Samouil, among others.\nProgram.\nThe closing program presented \"Reflections of Russia\"; that is, highlights of Russian culture, presented through a European perspective. It was directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca. Konstantin Ernst served as creative director and Andrei Nasonovskiy was the executive producer. \nThroughout the ceremony, sporting highlights of the Games were replayed on the screens of Fisht Stadium. A \"forest\" of 204 long LED light tubes changed color throughout and the audience was given LED necklaces that also changed colors periodically. \nOpening.\nThe closing ceremonies began with a countdown to the sounds of the 9th Movement of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" by Modest Mussorgsky, at the conclusion of which the LED forest turned on. Lyubov, the girl from the opening ceremony, entered the stadium in a rowing boat with two clowns and two children named Yuri and Valentina. An image representing the Black Sea below appeared on the floor. Many volunteers appeared below them dressed as sea fish, which first form the Taegeuk symbol (a nod to Pyeongchang, the next winter Games host city), the infinity symbol and a star, then combined to form four Olympic Rings and a dot, a reference to the malfunction of one of the rings at the Opening Ceremony failing to open properly. After a pause, the volunteers forming the dot \"opened\" into the fifth Ring. The Russian flag was carried by the Russian Olympic Champions from the games.\nNational anthem.\nThe Russian national anthem was performed by the All-Russian joint choir, directed by Valery Gergiev, and the Pan Russian Youth Symphony, directed by Yuri Bashmet. The Russian flag was then raised.\nEntrance of the flag bearers and the parade of the athletes.\nThe flag bearers for the participating nations then entered the stadium at the same time. More than 2800 athletes, representing 88 nations, entered the stadium. Following tradition, the athletes entered the stadium in a large group.\nMedal ceremonies.\nMedals were awarded for the women's 30 kilometre mass start freestyle (all won by Norwegian athletes) and the men's 50 kilometre mass start freestyle (all won by Russian athletes) events. The Russian national anthem was heard for the second time at the closing ceremony: this time, in a 2012 pre-recorded performance of the London 2012 arrangement by Philip Sheppard conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra. This was the first time since the 2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony that a host nation's anthem was heard twice in different forms.\nPerformances.\nThe ceremony continued with a number of \"chapters\" reflecting different aspects of Russian culture. First was a scene entitled \"The World of Malevich, Kandinsky and Chagall\" inspired by the paintings of Marc Chagall featuring brides, fiddlers, clowns and acrobats. In the \"Music\" chapter, a grand piano arose from the stadium floor with pianist Denis Matsuev performing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 followed by composers in white wigs and tails hitting the spotlight with 62 more pianos. In the \"Theatre\" chapter, dancers demonstrated the ballet cultures of Moscow (Bolshoi) and Saint Petersburg (Mariinsky) to the music of \"Scheherazade\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The First All-Russian Youth Symphony Orchestra accompanied the dancers.\nRussian novelists, poets and playwrights including Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Gogol, Chekhov and Akhmatova were honoured during the \"Literature\" chapter with a photo montage emerging from under the stage. A tribute to Russia's circus heritage, entitled \"The Magic of Circus\", featured more than 200 professional circus performers demonstrating their craft. The chapter culminated with the erection of a giant red-and-white big top.\nIn total, more than 7,000 people took part in the performance and more than 43,000 scenic elements were used.\nHandover of the Olympic flag and Pyeongchang Awaits You.\nFirst, the Greek flag was raised while its anthem played. The Olympic Hymn was sung and an honour guard lowered the Olympic flag. The flag was passed by Anatoly Pakhomov, the mayor of Sochi, to Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee, who then passed it to , the mayor of Pyeongchang, which will host the 2018 Winter Olympics. The flag was waved four times before it was taken from the stadium. It was raised again in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August 2016 during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang provided an eight-minute segment to introduce Koreans to the world. The national anthem of the Republic of Korea was sung by two South Korean children. The segment featured an elderly South Korean man playing a gayageum, a traditional Korean string instrument, with people dressed as swallows, a common bird found in Korea, and the Gangwon Province version of the traditional Korean song \"Arirang\", performed by Lee Seung-chul, Sumi Jo and Na Yoon-sun. Children created snowmen while images of various Winter Olympic events were shown on the stage, concluding with the logo of the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nGames declared closed and the extinguishing of the flame.\nThe games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach at 22:04 MSK, calling them 'The Athlete's Games'. He invited the world to assemble in four years' time in Pyeongchang for the 2018 Olympic Games. A final appearance was made by the three children accompanied by giant animatronic models of the three official mascots of the 2014 Olympic Games. A series of large mirrors combined and floated into the air to reveal the Olympic flame.\nThe Olympic flame in the stadium and outside was blown out by the Polar Bear, who shed a tear after the flame went out – an homage to Misha and the 1980 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, which a short clip was shown briefly. A remix of Aleksandra Pakhmutova's \"Goodbye, Moscow\" played and the Polar Bear extinguished the Olympic flame. The 1,000 members of the Pan-Russian Children's Choir assembled with the mascots carrying small flames in their hands and Abkazian-Russian soprano Hibla Gerzmava sung \"Goodbye, Sochi!\" with the children's choir to close the games. The ceremony ended with a fireworks display set to the music of Tchaikovsky. Russian DJ Kto hosted the afterparty."

        "title": "History of cycling infrastructure",
        "text": "The history of cycling infrastructure starts from shortly after the bike boom of the 1880s when the first short stretches of dedicated bicycle infrastructure were built, through to the rise of the automobile from the mid-20th century onwards and the concomitant decline of cycling as a means of transport, to cycling's comeback from the 1970s onwards.\nPre-motorisation.\nBy the end of the 19th century, cycling was growing from a hobby to an established form of transport. Cyclists campaigned to improve the existing, often poorly surfaced, roads and tracks. A US group was the Good Roads Movement, another the League of American Bicyclists. The UK equivalent was the Cyclists' Touring Club (CTC), which distributed a treatise entitled \"Roads: Their construction and maintenance\", and which, with the Bicycle Union, formed the Roads Improvement Association in October 1886. The first bicycle paths were built around this time.\nIn 1896 the first bikeway in the United States was created by splitting the pedestrian way of Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn). Following this successful installation numerous bicycle paths separate from the roadway were constructed by \"bicycle path associations\". In the United States the first was the nine-mile dedicated \"Cycle-Way\" built in 1897 to connect Pasadena, California to Los Angeles. Its right of way followed the stream bed of the Arroyo Seco and required 1,250,000 board feet (2,950 m3) of pine to construct. The roundtrip toll was 15¢ US and it was lit with electric lights along its entire length. The route did not succeed, and the right of way later became the route for the Arroyo Seco Parkway, an automobile freeway opened in 1940.\nCycling in the Netherlands began in 1870 and by the 1920s was the most popular mode of transportation (at about 75%). \nThe first bicycle path was built in 1885 in the city of Utrecht along the Maliebaan \n and in 1899 with two paved bicycle paths alongside the Breda-Tilburg cobblestone road.\nIn Germany, concerns arose regarding conflicts between cyclists, horse traffic and pedestrians. The first cycle tracks were constructed in Bremen in 1897, and there were extensive plans for Hamburg as early as 1899.\nEarly 20th century.\nWith the advent of the motor car, conflict arose between the increasingly powerful car lobby and bicycle users. By the 1920s and 1930s the German car lobbies initiated efforts to have cyclists removed from the roads so as to improve the convenience of motoring. In the UK, the cycling lobby was attempting to remove motor vehicles from the roads by calling for the building of special \"motor roads\" to accommodate them. This idea was opposed by the \"Motorists' Union\", who feared that it would lead to motorists' losing the freedom to use public roads.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 1926 the CTC discussed an unsuccessful motion calling for cycle tracks to be built on each side of roads for \"the exclusive use of cyclists\", and that cyclists could be taxed, providing the revenue was used for the provision of such tracks. \nThe first dedicated roadside optional cycle tracks was built, as an experiment for the Ministry of Transport, beside Western Avenue between Hanger Lane and Greenford Road in 1934 opened by Leslie Hore-Belisha, the new Minister of Transport. It was thought that \"the prospect of cycling in comfort as well as safety would be appreciated by most cyclists themselves\". Other early cycle tracks built before the 1939 Alness report included;\nHowever, the idea ran into trenchant opposition from cycling groups, with the CTC distributing pamphlets warning against the threat of cycle paths.\nIn the 1930s, Britain’s Ministry of Transport built an extensive network of bike highways around the country—at least 280 miles of paved, protected infrastructure dedicated to cyclists alone. For decades, it was entirely forgotten—overgrown and overlooked—so much so that no one seems to remember that these lanes had existed at all.\nLocal CTC branches organised mass meetings to reject the use of cycle tracks and any suggestion that cyclists should be forced to use such devices. In 1935, a packed general meeting of the CTC adopted a motion rejecting ministerial plans for cycle path construction. The CTC were listened to, and the use of cycle tracks largely fell out of favour in the UK until the early 1970s.\nSince the 1930s, the established cycling lobby in the UK and Ireland has taken a critical and measured view of the utility and value of segregating cyclists. In 1947, in response to official suggestions that cyclists should use cycle-tracks, the CTC adopted a motion expressing \"determined opposition to cycle paths alongside public roads\".\nPost War.\nIn the UK, little use of separate cycle track systems took place except in the so-called \"new towns\" such as Stevenage and Harlow. From the end of the 1960s in Nordic countries, the Swedish SCAFT guidelines on urban planning were highly influential and argued that non-motorised traffic must be segregated from motorised traffic wherever possible. Under the influence of these guidelines cyclists and pedestrians were treated as a homogeneous group to be catered for using similar facilities.\nThe guidelines strongly influenced cities such as Helsinki and Västerås to build large cycle path networks. By the late 1960s and 1970s, with the cyclists mainly gone, many German towns began removing cycle tracks so as to accommodate more car parking. Increasing traffic congestion and the 1970s oil shocks contributed to a resurgence in cycling in some countries, notably the Netherlands and Denmark. Outside of SCAFT-inspired developments in Nordic countries, the use of segregated cycle facilities was mainly confined to university towns with established populations of bicycle users. For example, in 1966, a 'Bicycle Lane' group in the City of Davis, California were elected to the City Council promising to push for bike lanes in the state of California, achieving them early in Davis.\n1970s.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 1970 in the United Kingdom, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation produced the . One of the important elements of this plan, and of its subsequent implementation, was the Milton Keynes redway system of segregated cycle/pedestrian paths. These are fully separated from the road system, only occasionally running alongside it. One of the aims of the redways was to make travel for pedestrians and cyclists convenient, safe, pleasant and accident free, but a study suggests that the system has only partially met these expectations.\nMore recent statistical data shows that the accident rate for pedestrians in Milton Keynes is just 46% of the average for England and the rate for cyclists is 87%. However, the secluded semi-rural nature of many redways that make them pleasant by day can make some people feel unsafe to use them after dark.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, bicycle use declined from the post-war period up to about 1975 as automobile use increased and commuting distances increased. Bicycle traffic policy was almost completely excluded from the national government vision. Things began to turn around in about 1972 with not just the oil crisis, but also the all-time peak in traffic deaths - especially among children, the most vulnerable of road users - leading to the mass \"Stop de Kindermoord\" ('Stop the Child Murder') protest. Local and national policy began to pay more attention to cycling. Bicycle use, which had been dropping dramatically, stabilized and even rose over the next two decades. Amsterdam's traffic circulation plan of 1978 gave priority to bicycle facilities, in particular separated cycle tracks, which also meant taking some road space away from motor vehicles. The national government soon followed with subsidies for constructing bike paths alongside secondary and minor roads so that \"lost ground could be made up\". Another famous traffic circulation plan that gave priority to the cyclist is effective in Groningen.\nUnited States.\nIn 1971 in the United States, the California state government contracted with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for the design of bikeways (bicycle paths, bicycle side-paths, bicycle lanes).\nUCLA largely copied Dutch bicycle facilities practice (primarily sidepaths) to create their bikeway designs, but the derived designs were not made public. The California Statewide Bicycle Committee (CSBC) was created in 1975,\ninitially composed of representatives of governmental and motoring organisations. When John Forester, a cyclist representative, became a member he concluded that the real motivation for moving cyclists aside was the convenience of motorists, although the stated reason was the safety of cyclists.\nWhen serious safety issues were identified with the proposed designs, the resulting cyclist opposition discredited the designs and prevented enactment of a mandatory side-path law. This forced the state to start over with new bikeway design standards in 1976. Those designs were subsequently adapted by the Association of American State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to form the first edition of the AASHTO Guide for Bicycle Facilities, which is widely followed in the USA.\n1980s to present.\nThe 1980s saw the start of experimental cycle route projects in Danish towns such as Århus, Odense and Herning, and the beginning of a large programme of cycle facilities construction as part of a \"bicycle masterplan\" in the Netherlands. Following the \"bicycle boom\" of the early 1980s, German towns began revisiting the concept.\nThe use of segregated cycle facilities is promoted by a large segment of the cycling community, for example lane and path cyclists, and also by many organisations associated with the environmental movement. The rise of the \"Green\" movement in the 1990s has been accompanied by requests for the construction of cycle networks in many countries. This has led to various high-profile cycle network projects, in Montreal, Dublin, Portland, New York, Boston, London and many other cities.\nIn the 2000s urban planners in several cities started to use models and simulations to estimate future bicycle paths usage and the extent to which they would improve community health outcomes.\nUnited Kingdom.\n[Author Carlton] Reid and his collaborator, urban planner John Dales, are raising money on Kickstarter to continue their research, with the goal of restoring some of the network to use. (With two weeks to go, they’ve doubled their original fundraising goal.) They’ve already heard from cities on the network with money to spend. “Some of these cities look as though they’d be excited to work with us,” Reid says. “We’re going to work with the willing first.” Soon, it’s possible that these decades-old cycling highways could once again be part of Britain’s transportation network."

        "title": "1969–70 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1969–70 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1969–70 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his fourth season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 18-7, Magees best record during his six seasons as head coach, and was the last Georgetown team to appear in a post-season tournament until the 1974-75 team played in the 1975 NCAA tournament.\nSeason recap.\nSince the 1942-43 teams appearance in the 1943 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Georgetown had only been to the post-season once, when the 1952-53 team went to the 1953 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), after that never contending for the NCAA tournament and always falling short of consideration for the NIT. Georgetowns recent teams had been especially disappointing, losing seven of their final 10 games in the 1964-65 season, eight of their final 11 in the 1966-67 season, and seven of their last nine games in 1968-69, each time squandering a strong start that otherwise might have gotten them into the post-season. However, Coach Magee had higher hopes in 1969-70, with senior center Charlie Adrion, senior guard Mike Laska. and junior guard Don Weber returning and sophomore forwards Andy Gill, Mike Laughna, and Art White joining the varsity squad after a very strong 1968-69 season on the freshman team. Magee was especially excited about White, whom he declared in 1970 to be the \"best prospect I have coached, and with the potential to be...the best in Georgetown history before he graduates.\" A general feeling existed among Georgetown fans that the team had a legitimate shot at a post-season berth, especially in the NIT.\nWith White consistently scoring in double figures and Laughna beginning the season and his varsity career with a 14-rebound performance against American, the Hoyas went 12-2 in the seasons first 14 games. In an unusual event during this stretch that would prove significant later, they were losing 41-26 on December 18, 1969, in the first half at an 18th-ranked Jacksonville team led by Artis Gilmore when hostile Jacksonville fans flooded onto the court, prompting Magee to pull his team from the game. The games officials ruled it a Georgetown forfeit and gave the Hoyas a loss. Georgetown appealed the decision to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and in February 1970 the NCAA overruled the officials decision and declared the game a \"no contest,\" meaning that neither Georgetown or Jacksonville would be credited with a win or loss for the game.\nIn late December 1969, Laughna scored a combined 50 points and 31 rebounds against Penn State and Stanford in the Kodak Classic and was declared the Classics Most Valuable Player. In his next game after the Classic, he opened the new year of 1970 with a 19-rebound performance against Holy Cross.\nOn January 14, 1970, Georgetown defeated longtime rival St. Joseph's 89–80, the Hoyas' first victory over the Hawks since 1967 and only their second since 1956. In a balanced attack, five Hoyas finished in double figures, and the win was crucial to Georgetown's hopes for a postseason tournament bid.\nIn February, Charlie Adrion had 20 points and 15 rebounds against New York University and five days later scored 20 points at Boston College. Georgetown posted a home record of 12-1, the best in the history of McDonough Gymnasium at the time, and Laughna scored in double figures in 21 of the 25 games he played in, including the final 18 games of the year. Don Weber scored in double figures 15 times, averaging 11.2 points and 3.3 assists per game, and had a career-high 25 points against George Washington.\nDespite this, the Hoyas suffered a number of road losses late in the year that again put the teams hopes of a postseason bid in jeopardy, especially a loss to Manhattan at Madison Square Garden in New York City late in the season in which Adrion scored a season-low six points. But Saint Peter's upset Manhattan in the last game of the season while the Hoyas beat Penn State in their last regular-season game, with Laughna scoring 21 points and grabbing 13 rebounds and Adrion scoring 13 points. This left Georgetown with an 18-6 regular-season record and prompted the NIT selection committee to invite the Hoyas to the 1970 NIT, the schools first post-season tournament appearance in 17 years. The December 1969 \"no contest\" game at Jacksonville played an unforeseen role; if Georgetown had completed and lost that game or if the NCAA had stood by the game officials decision that Georgetown had forfeited, the Hoyas would have finished the regular season at 18-7, and that difference probably would have cost Georgetown its NIT invitation.\nThe Hoyas faced Louisiana State, led by Pete Maravich, at Madison Square Garden in the first round of the NIT, with CBS televising the game – at a time when there was no regular national television coverage of college basketball – to showcase Maravich. Although Maravich was averaging 45.2 points per game and had scored over 50 points in a game 28 times, Georgetown guard Mike Laska held him to 20 points in a man-to-man defense and Art White scored 28 points, helping Georgetown to come back from seven points down with 3:08 left in the game to close to 81-80 with 17 seconds left. But the Hoyas had to foul Maravich immediately to stop the clock, and he sank both his free throws to give Louisiana State an 83-80 lead. Georgetown closed to 83-82, but ran out of time and was knocked out of the tournament.\nWhite was the Hoyas leading scorer for the year with 15.1 points per game. Laughna finished the season with a team-leading 261 rebounds, averaging 10.4 rebounds per game.\nPleased with the season despite Georgetowns early exit from the NIT, Magee believed that it heralded a new era of success for Georgetown basketball, but it was not to be. The next season, the Hoyas would go a mediocre 12-14, and in Magees final season, 1971-72, they would fall to a dismal 3-23 record. It would take the arrival of John Thompson, Jr., as head coach in 1972-73 for Georgetown to begin its rise to the status of a national basketball power.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSource\n1969–70 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "The 1972–73 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1972–73 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his first season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 12–14 – a significant improvement over the previous seasons record – was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time, and had no post-season play.\nJohn Thompson arrives.\nThe 29-year-old Thompson was only the third African-American head coach in the history of NCAA Division basketball and was the first to take charge of a major college basketball program. He had been a star player for Washington, D.C.s Archbishop Carroll High School and for Providence College, had played for two successful seasons with the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association, and then had returned to Washington, D.C., to coach St. Anthony's High School to a record of 122-28 in six seasons.\nAt Georgetown, Thompson inherited a team that had gone 3–23 the previous season, the culmination of a 25-year stretch of mostly undistinguished basketball at Georgetown. Although the team had appeared in the National Invitation Tournament in 1953 and 1970, between the 1947-48 season and the end of the previous season Georgetown had posted an overall record under .500 and its total of 296 wins during those 25 seasons was the lowest among the 32 Catholic universities playing Division I college basketball in the United States. The team also had had no NCAA tournament appearances since 1943.\nThompsons arrival heralded the schools rise to the status of a national basketball power; the 12–14 record this season was a significant improvement over the 3–23 finish of the previous year, and the 1972-73 squad was the last Georgetown men's basketball team to finish with a losing record until the 1998–99 season. Georgetown had hired Thompson in the hope that he could guide the Hoyas to an \"occasional\" National Invitation Tournament (NIT) appearance, but during his seasons as head coach he would lead the Hoyas to 24 straight post-season tournaments – 19 NCAA tournaments and five NITs – from the 1974-75 to the 1997-98 seasons, and to the national championship in the 1983-84 season.\nSeason recap.\nThompsons first recruiting class consisted of five players. One of them was center Merlin Wilson, who had played for him at St. Anthonys and followed him to Georgetown to play college basketball. Wilson scored 24 points in the season opener against Saint Francis. At Loyola, the Hoyas outrebounded the Greyhounds 65-33, and Wilson pulled down 24 of Georgetowns rebounds. By mid-season, Wilson was averaging 12 points and 13 rebounds a game, a level of play unknown at Georgetown for many years, and was among the top ten college players in rebounds; a \"Tampa Tribune\" columnist wrote that the Hoyas were \"a team destined to be one of the next great powers in college basketball\" because of Wilsons talent. He scored 25 points and had 17 rebounds and eight blocks against Navy, had a 17-point, 17-rebound performance against Fordham in a big win, and had 15 points and 16 rebounds against St. Mary's in the last home game of the season. He finished the season as the teams leader in scoring and rebounds, and was ranked 14th in the United States with 14.1 rebounds per game.\nAnother major Thompson recruit for his first season as a collegiate head coach was guard Jonathan Smith. Smith, like Wilson, had played for Thompson at St. Anthonys and followed him to Georgetown. Although some observers expected Smith to be a reserve, he quickly emerged as a major force for the Hoyas, scoring a career-high 25 points twice during the season, against Penn State and George Washington. Smith finished the season second on the team only to Wilson in scoring.\n1972–73 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1971–72 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1971–72 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his sixth and final season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 3-23 and therefore was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nForward Art White, thought at the time to have been the greatest player in Georgetown history, had left the team at the end of the previous season because of academic difficulties, and he sat out this season entirely. Magees relationship with his players had begun to unravel the previous year, when the 1970-71 team had followed up the 1969-70 team's appearance in the 1970 National Invitation Tournament with a disappointing performance that Magee blamed on the players – including the once highly regarded White – although he reserved praise for then-junior forward Mike Laughna. In all, Georgetown lost all but two of its top nine scorers from the 1970-71 season.\nMagees relationship with his players continued to deteriorate this year, but that and the loss of scorers were not the 1971-72 squads only problems. Athletic director Robert Sigholtz had committed the Hoyas to a schedule that included only 10 home games and forced the team to play nine straight road games between December 13, 1971, and January 22, 1972. Magee, working in the last year of his contract with no sign of the university offering an extension, openly feuded with Sigholtz over this schedule and over whether or not Sigholz had provided Magee with an adequate recruiting budget, which totaled only $5,140. After Laughna, now a senior and the teams captain, said in an interview with \"The Washington Post\" that Georgetown did not seem to spend very much of the revenue it earned from the basketball team on the basketball program itself, Sigholtz responded with an ineffective late-season news conference that failed to address Laughnas comments and deflected criticism onto Magee, blaming him for the unfavorable schedule and for not using fully the recruiting tools he had available to him. Observers took away little more than the impression that the Georgetown athletic department was deeply troubled.\nUnder these difficult circumstances, Mike Laughna put in a creditable performance on the court during the otherwise dismal season, with 25 points and 11 rebounds at Texas, 22 points and 12 rebounds three days later at San Francisco, and 24 points and 15 rebounds against George Washington, He passed Jim Barry as the top scorer in Georgetown history on March 4, 1972, during a loss at Boston College in the final game of the season and of his collegiate career, and finished with 1,234 career points. Despite his efforts, the team won only one game each in December, January, and February.\nThe 1971-72 team's .115 winning percentage was the worst in Georgetown men's basketball history and well below the previous worst of .238 set by the 5-16 team of 1930-31. Magee resigned two weeks after Sigholtzs news conference after a six-year tenure as head coach which saw two winning seasons and one post-season tournament appearance. Sigholtz resigned nine days after Magee.\nAlthough it was not known at the time, the 1971-72 season brought a 25-year stretch of mostly undistinguished basketball at Georgetown to an end. Although the team had appeared in the National Invitation Tournament in 1953 and 1970, between the 1947-48 season and the end of this season, Georgetown had posted an overall record under .500 and its total of 296 wins during those 25 seasons was the lowest among the 32 Catholic universities playing Division I college basketball in the United States. The team also had had no NCAA tournament appearances since 1943. The arrival of John Thompson, Jr., as head coach the following season, however, would begin Georgetowns rise to the status of national basketball power.\nRoster.\nSource\n1971–72 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The United Hospitals' Lawn Tennis Club is the combined lawn tennis club of the five medical schools in London. The constituent medical schools collaboratively form a Men's and Ladies team which competes at a high standard against various organizations. The club plays annual matches against the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. Additional opponents who have been played against include the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, the British Army, the London School of Economics, University College London and the Queen's Club. The individual medical schools also compete against one another in a tournament taking place over the summer. There is also a one-day mixed doubles tournament in the winter with individual pairs from each medical school competing against one another. Finally, there is the annual President's match, whereby the President chooses a team of alumni to play against a team chosen from the student body by the Men's and Women's captains. This match takes place at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.\nHistory.\nThe constituent teams of the tennis club are from Bart's and the London Medical School, Imperial College School of Medicine, King's College London GKT School of Medical Education, St George's University of London and University College London Medical School. The club originally consisted of thirteen London medical schools but over the course of the 20th Century mergers with the major educational institutions of London consolidated this to the now-established five schools.\nThe medical schools compete against each other for The Inter Hospital Lawn Tennis Challenge Cup established in 1887. It is one of the oldest tennis tournaments in the world for which the original trophy is still competed. The trophy was commissioned in the same year as the All England's famous men's trophy and continues to be played for on an annual basis. The trophy was lost for a thirty-year period towards the latter stages of the 20th century but was rediscovered. The 2012-2013 tournament year was decided without a victor due to a fixtures discrepancy. The cup was thus not awarded as reported in the medical student newspaper\nThe club has built on its historical foundations and has over eighty active members to this day. The club is run by a committee of elected students, an alumni committee, several Vice-Presidents and the President, Professor Peter Mortimer.\nPast presidents\nSir Marcus Setchell\nNotable Alumni\nJPR Williams\nTournaments.\nMen's Doubles League (Awarded the Inter Hospital Lawn Tennis Challenge Cup since 1887)\nWomen's Doubles League (Awarded the Mortimer Shield)\nMixed Doubles Summer League (Awarded the Mixed Doubles Shield)\nMixed Doubles Tournament (Awarded the MPS Shield)\nExhibition matches.\nMatches are played across the year against a host of prestigious clubs, including:\nCambridge University Tennis Club; Oxford University Tennis Club; Army Women's Tennis Team and Queen's Club.\nThere are also inter-club matches, notably:\nPresident's Day; Alumni vs Students Doubles Match and an Alumni Social Doubles Day.\nOther events.\nThe club holds an Annual General Meeting at Royal Air Force Club (RAF). It is attended by the President, Vice-Presidents, alumni, student committee and student members.\nThe annual UH Christmas dinner 2021 was hosted at the Queen's Club."

        "title": "Volleyball in the Philippines",
        "text": " \nThe history of volleyball in the Philippines refers to the history of volleyball in the Philippines as a recreation and as a sport. Philippine volleyball history began in 1910 when the Philippines was a United States territory (1898–1946). The Filipinos have made significant contributions to volleyball in its evolution as a professional and international game. The Filipinos continued playing volleyball up to the modern-day period in its status as an independent republic (1946–present).\nVolleyball in the Philippines is a female-dominated sports, with two commercial leagues serving as the de facto top-flight leagues in the country; the Philippine Super Liga and the Premier Volleyball League. The Spikers' Turf is the top-tier men's volleyball league in the Philippines.\nIntroduction.\nIt was introduced to the Filipinos by an American named Elwood S. Brown, the then Physical Director of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). It became a popular game held in backyards and at beaches in the islands. At first, the Filipinos invented their own rules for the game. US soldiers who were assigned to the different islands of the Philippine during the period also helped in the widespread introduction of volleyball to the Filipinos. These American military servicemen encouraged the Filipinos to join them in playing during their time-off from military duties. Early in the history of the game of volleyball in the Philippines, the Filipinos used trees as makeshift net holders (the net was hung between the two chosen trees).\nFilipino contributions.\nThe Filipinos contributed two items to modern-day volleyball:\nInspiration for the three-hit limit.\nThe first contribution was that the Filipinos inspired American players to create the \"three-hit limit\" for each player in modern-day volleyball. This number of limits in hitting the ball was based by American volleyball players from the Filipino way of letting each player hit the ball before sending or \"volleying\" it over to the side of the opponent team. The Americans revised this method to become the \"three-hit limit\" because the old way of taking turns in hitting the ball took too much time, and had been observed to affect the intensity of the game and the motivation of the participating volleyballers (lessens the \"challenge and the competitive nature\" of the game).\nSetting and spiking the ball.\nThe second Filipino contribution was the \"set and spike\" maneuver, also known as \"set and hit\", \"setting and spiking\", or just \"spike\". A spike is a form of volleyball \"attack\" done by the player by jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court. The set, on the other hand, is an over-hand pass done by the \"setter\" (another player) using the wrists to push finger-tips at the ball.\nIt was after accepting the new set of rules created by the Americans regarding the \"three-hit limit\" when the Filipino volleyball players at the time invented the \"set and spike\" maneuver. The new technique invented by the Filipinos prompted American enthusiasts and participants in volleyball to call it as the \"Filipino bomb\", because \"spiking the ball\" was like a \"hit\" or a form of \"attack\" that can squash or \"kill\" the opportunity of the opponent team to hit the ball back for a possible point or win. A more apt description of \"hitting and spiking\" is that it is \"an offensive style of passing the ball in a high trajectory to be struck by another player.\"\nAssociations.\nThe Philippine Amateur Volleyball Association (PAVA) was founded by the Playground and Recreation Bureau (PRB) of the Philippines on July 4, 1961.

John O'Reilly coached the team in his first season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 8-8.\nNew head coach O'Reilly coached three sports at Georgetown – basketball, baseball, and track – and was destined to coach the basketball team to some of its great early triumphs. He would coach the team for 11 seasons, interrupted by a hiatus during the 1921-22 and 1922-23 seasons due to illness, and post an overall record of 87-47. His tenure would see most of a 52-game home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium between the final game of the 1916-17 season and midway through the 1923-24 season that included victories over top national teams North Carolina (twice), Georgia Tech, and Kentucky. Fifteen of the 19 straight victories over George Washington also would occur with him at the helm.\nSeason recap.\nThe move to Ryan Gymnasium meant that this was the first Georgetown men's basketball team to play its games on campus. Opened in 1906, when competitive college basketball was just beginning at Georgetown, Ryan had not been intended to host competitive sporting events; it had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room-only basis on an indoor track above the basketball court. This precluded large crowds at the Hoyas home games despite the teams home success during the 13 years at Ryan, limiting revenue for the self-sustaining Basketball Association, which funded the teams travel expenses. Despite this drawback, Ryan would serve as the Hoyas home court through the end of the 1926-27 season, although from the 1918-19 season through 1926-27 the Hoyas would play very few road games in order to keep travel expenses to a bare minimum.\nGeorgetown defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, the first of 19 straight wins over George Washington before George Washington suspended the series after the 1923-24 season.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

        "text": "The Grinnell Pioneers men's basketball team represents the Grinnell College, located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States, in NCAA Division III basketball competition.\nHistory.\nMissouri Valley Conference.\nGrinnell was a member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1919 though 1928 when it split in two. It would ultimately stay in what was renamed the Missouri Valley Conference.\n2005–present.\nIn February 2005, Grinnell became the first Division III school featured in a regular season basketball game by the ESPN network family in 30 years when it faced off against the Beloit Buccaneers on ESPN2. Grinnell lost 86–85. Grinnell College's basketball team attracted ESPN due to the team's run and gun style of playing basketball, also known as the Grinnell System. Coach Dave Arseneault's \"system\" incorporates a continual full-court press, a fast-paced offense, an emphasis on offensive rebounding, a barrage of three-point shots and substitutions of five players at a time every 35 to 40 seconds. This allows a higher average playing time for more players than the \"starters\" and suits the Division III goals of scholar-athletes. \"The System\" has been criticized for not teaching the principles of defense. However, under \"The System,\" Grinnell has won three conference championships over the past ten years and have regularly placed in the top half of the conference. Arseneault's teams have set numerous NCAA scoring records and several individuals on the Grinnell team have led the nation in scoring or assists.\nOn November 19, 2011 Grinnell player Griffin Lentsch set a Division III individual scoring record in a game against Principia College. The guard scored 89 points, besting the previous record of 77, also set by Pioneers player Jeff Clement in 1998. Lentsch made 27 of his 55 shots, including 15 three-pointers as Grinnell won the high-scoring game 145 to 97.\nOn November 20, 2012 Grinnell's Jack Taylor broke Lentsch's scoring record—as well as the records for NCAA and collegiate scoring—in a 179–104 victory over Faith Baptist Bible. Taylor scored 138 points, besting the previous NCAA record of 113. Taylor scored 109 points in a November 2013 game against Crossroads College to become the first player in NCAA history to have two 100-point games.\nIn December 2022, Grinnell set a NCAA record (in all divisions) for taking the most three-point shots at 111 attempts. Every attempted field goal was from beyond the three-point arc and Grinnell beat Emmaus Bible College, 124 to 67.\nFor all the plaudits Grinnell receives for The System, leading the nation in scoring rarely translates into success against better quality opponents. In the twenty-first century, the team has only won its conference championship three times. That was also the last time the team qualified for the NCAA Division III Tournament, where it lost by 41 in its first-round matchup."

        "text": "The 1980–81 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1980–81 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his ninth season as head coach. It was the last season in which they played all of their home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 20-12 overall, 9-5 in Big East play. They advanced to the semifinals of the 1981 Big East tournament before losing to Syracuse. In the 1981 NCAA tournament, they lost in the first round to James Madison.\nSeason recap.\nJunior guard and team co-captain Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd had been Georgetowns top scorer in each of the two previous seasons, and his scoring prowess continued this season. In the first three games of the season in the Great Alaska Shootout, he scored a combined 52 points, which he followed up in the home opener against Saint Leo with a perfect 11-for-11 from the field. Except for a 7-for-29 performance against Pennsylvania on January 3, 1981, and 7-for-19 against St. John's four days later, Floyd was a strong scorer all season.\nJunior guard and team co-captain Eric Smith joined the starting lineup this season and started every game for the rest of his collegiate career. He played a strong defense in 1980-81, shot 48% from the field, averaged 10.8 points per game, and twice scored 28 points in a game. In one of them, against Connecticut, he shot 13 for 21 (61.9%) from the field in what some observers considered the best individual effort seen in the Big East up to that time.\nFreshman Fred Brown played both guard and small forward during the year and performed well all season long, starting all 32 games. In his second game, he scored a season-high 16 points against North Carolina in the Great Alaska Shootout. He also scored 14 points and had 10 assists in the win over Boston College and scored the winning tip-in in the overtime game at Seton Hall. He finished the season shooting a team-high 58.4% from the field and was first in assists and second in steals.\nFreshman guard Gene Smith emerged as a defensive specialist during the season, earning a starting spot on the roster in the last eight games of the year. In the February 4, 1981, game against Villanova, he held Villanovas Stewart Granger scoreless and forced the Wildcats into committing several offensive fouls. Junior center Mike Hancock had his most productive season, scoring in 30 of 31 games and averaging 8.7 points per game.\nThe most unusual event of this season took place on February 28, 1981, during the final regular-season game. Big East rival Connecticut was visiting McDonough Gymnasium when, during a timeout, Connecticuts Jonathan the Husky mascot started a fistfight with Georgetowns Jack the Bulldog mascot, leading to Jonathans ejection from McDonough. Thanks to senior center Mike Fraziers heroics, which included a block and rebound at the end of the game to preserve a 60-58 Georgetown victory, over a hundred Georgetown students gathered outside Fraziers on-campus apartment for an informal post-game pep rally.\nThe Hoyas advanced to the semifinals of the 1981 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Syracuse. They were the No. 7 seed in the East Region of the 1981 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the third of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and were upset in the first round by the East Region No. 10 seed, James Madison. During the second half of the James Madison game, Sleepy Floyd passed Derrick Jackson as the leading scorer in Georgetown men's basketball history. He finished the season shooting better than 50 percent from the floor for the second straight year, scoring 607 points during the season, averaging 19 points per game, and, between shooting and assists, contributing over 35 percent of the 1980-81 teams offense. For the third straight year, he was Georgetowns top scorer.\nOne of the most important events of the season took place off the court when, on February 2, 1981, Patrick Ewing, a senior center at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, committed to play college basketball at Georgetown the following season. Ewing – destined to become Georgetown′s head coach in 2017 after a lengthy post-graduation career as a player and coach in the National Basketball Association – generally is considered the best men's basketball player in Georgetown history, and his arrival would transform the Georgetown men's basketball program into an established national power.\nThe 1980-81 team was the last one to use McDonough Gymnasium as its home court. Although McDonough had served in this capacity for 30 seasons, the school announced in August 1981 that the Hoyas were moving to the much larger Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, for their home schedule the following season. Membership in the Big East and success on the court had increased Georgetown′s visibility, and the anticipation of Ewings arrival caused the demand for tickets to spike. McDonough remained the Hoyas′ practice facility and they continued to host occasional games there in future years, but it could no longer accommodate Georgetown′s growing fan base.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1980–81 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The 1986–87 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1986–87 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 15th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 29–5, 12–4 in Big East play. They shared the conference regular season championship with Pittsburgh and Syracuse and won the 1987 Big East men's basketball tournament, defeating Syracuse in the final game for the fifth Big East tournament championship in Georgetown men's basketball history. They advanced to the East Region final of the 1987 NCAA tournament before losing to Providence. Nicknamed \"Reggie and the Miracles\", the team was ranked No. 4 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nAfter the adoption of a shot clock the previous season, another major change came to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's basketball this year with the adoption of a three-point shot. The three-point line was set a , where it would remain until it was increased to at the beginning of the 2008-09 season.\nIn May 1986, guards Horace Broadnax and Michael Jackson and guard-forward David Wingate all had graduated, and center Grady Mateen had transferred after his sophomore season to Ohio State during the off-season. The 1986-87 Hoyas thus returned only two starters and three upperclassmen from the previous year, and their heavy reliance on young and inexperienced players suggested a rebuilding year was at hand. Instead, senior guard and team captain Reggie Williams and his teammates played so well in Big East Conference play and the 1987 NCAA tournament, including many come-from behind wins, that the team became known as \"Reggie and the Miracles.\"\nWilliams had one of the best individual seasons in Georgetown mens basketball history, leading the Hoyas in scoring 29 times and in rebounding 23 times during the season. During the first six games, he averaged 29.8 points per game, including a career-high 39 points against Washburn during the Hawaii-Hilo Classic on November 29, 1986. Two weeks later, he scored 26 points against Arizona, and a week after that he had 24 points against Texas-El Paso. In January 1987, early in the Big East season, he scored 31 points as the Hoyas came back from a halftime deficit to beat Pittsburgh.\nJunior Perry McDonald had a breakout season, and also contributed to Georgetowns nine-game winning streak at the start of the season. After two years as a reserve shooting guard, McDonald moved to forward to replace the departed Wingate, and at his new position his scoring and rebounding skills finally came to the fore. In the first game of the year he scored a then-career-high 17 points against Quincy in the opening game of the Hawaii-Hilo Classic, and he went on to score in double figures in 30 of the seasons 34 games. His scoring average per game jumped from 4.4 and 3.4 points in the previous two seasons to 13.0 points this year.\nFreshman guard Mark Tillmon joined the team this season, starting 25 games and appearing in 33. He debuted with a 13-point game, and despite shooting only 39% from the field scored in double digits 13 times, finishing third in scoring on the team. In his best game of the year, he scored 19 points and seven rebounds at the Capital Centre against sixth-ranked DePaul. Overall, he averaged 9.7 points per game during the season.\nAnother freshman guard, Dwayne Bryant, arrived as one of Georgetowns most highly regarded recruits of the 1980s and started 28 of the teams 34 games. He shot only 34% from the field overall and 26% from beyond the three-point line, however, and averaged only 19 minutes and 4.3 points per game, but he showed some of his offensive potential by finishing only one assist short of the team lead and with the second highest number of assists of any rookie player on the varsity team in Georgetown history. He would emerge as an important scoring threat during his junior year.\nSophomore forward Jaren Jackson spent the season in a purely reserve role, averaging only 11 minutes and 5.7 points per game. Although he scored a season-high 19 points against Pittsburgh and had an 11-point, eight-rebound effort against Providence, his performance slumped as the season wore on and he averaged only 3.3 points per game during the latter part of the schedule. He would not emerge as one of Georgetowns top players until late in the following season.\nOn January 31, 1987, Georgetown faced Syracuse at the Capital Centre before a national television audience. Thompson decided that Georgetown center Ben Gillery could not compete against 6-foot-11 (211-cm) Syracuse center Rony Seikaly, so he took the unusual step of putting the 6-foot-4 guard-forward (193-cm) McDonald, known for his fearless style against larger opponents, in to play against Seikaly. Georgetown trailed for most of the game, but McDonald rose to the occasion, putting in one of the best performances of his collegiate career. On defense, he held Seikaly to four field goals and 13 points and scored a career-high 21 points despite Seikalys height advantage, including a turnaround jumper at the buzzer in overtime to give Georgetown an 83–81 victory. He also had seven rebounds. Williams, meanwhile, scored 30 points in the game.\nAs Georgetown continued through its Big East schedule, Williams continued to excel. He scored 34 points and had 11 rebounds at Connecticut, and in a game against Pittsburgh in which the Hoyas trailed by as many as 12, he scored 21 points as Georgetown rallied to win by 13. McDonald, meanwhile, also again displayed his scoring prowess in a rematch with Syracuse at the Carrier Dome, scoring 22 points. In the last game of the regular season, Williams scored 24 points in a win over 20th-ranked Providence.\nGeorgetown shared the conference regular-season championship with Pittsburgh and Syracuse. Receiving a bye in the first round of the 1987 Big East men's basketball tournament, the Hoyas defeated Boston College in the quarterfinal with Williams scoring 24 points, Providence in the semifinal behind a 22-point performance by Williams, and Syracuse in the final in a game in which Williams scored 25 points. It was the fifth Big East tournament championship for Georgetown, and the third in four years.\nGeorgetown was the No. 1 seed in the Southeast Region of the 1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the ninth of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. In the first round, Williams led the way with 21 points in a win over Bucknell, and the Hoyas advanced to face a talented Ohio State team led by senior guard-forward Dennis Hopson in the second round.\nAt the half, Ohio State had an 11-point lead over the Hoyas. After the first minute of the second half, the lead had increased to 15, and Georgetown fell as many as 21 points behind the Buckeyes in the second half even though Williams scored 24 points during the game. When Bryant went to the bench with four fouls early in the second half, Thompson put reserve guard Charles Smith into the game to replace him. Smith, recruited to serve strictly as a reserve, had played behind Horace Broadnax and Michael Jackson the previous year, averaging only 3.0 points per game with limited playing time, and this season as a reserve behind Bryant and Tillmon had started only two games and scored only seven points before returning to the bench, and was averaging only five points per game. Against Ohio State, however, his performance suddenly changed the entire path of his basketball career as he rallied the Hoyas with a 22-point effort. In the final seconds of the game, after Thompson told him not to shoot and instead to get the ball to a more proven player, Smith found himself open and took a shot anyway; he sank it to give Georgetown an 82–79 win. True to form, \"Reggie and the Miracles\" had staged a tremendous comeback behind Smiths breakout effort, winning a game after trailing by double digits for the seventh time. Like McDonald, who had emerged during the Big East regular season as a star, Smith would become one of the great players in Georgetown history.\nIn the Southeast Region semifinal, Williams put in a 34-point performance in the Hoyas victory over Kansas. The season finally came to an end in the Southeast Region final, when the regions No. 6 seed, Big East rival Providence, upset the Hoyas in a game in which Williams closed out his collegiate career by scoring 25 points. He finished the year setting nine of the schools individual season records, including points scored (802), three-point shots (78), points per game (23.6), rebounds (294), and minutes played (1,205). He graduated in May 1987 as one of only four Georgetown players to score 2,000 or more points, with a career average of 15.3 points per game. During his four years on the team, the Hoyas had posted a 122-19 (.865) record overall and a 56-5 (.918) record at home (.918).\nThe team was ranked No. 4 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1986–87 Schedule and results.\nSources\nGeorgetown and Arizona State cancelled a game they had scheduled for December 9, 1986, after the Pacific-10 Conference insisted that its officials referee the game even though the contract between the two schools mandated the use of non-conference officials. Wishing to replace the Arizona State game, Georgetown encountered difficulty in finding a team on short notice that could play on a date that fit into the Hoyas remaining schedule, but on January 28, 1987, booked Bowie State for a game on February 16, 1987. With the Capital Centre hosting the Ice Capades that day, the game was scheduled for McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

Unfortunately the team proved to be undersized compared to their much larger opposition eventually finishing the tournament with 0 wins, 3 losses and recording only 1 scored in the whole tournament. This proved to be a disappointment to the team who were looking to play with a high tempo game due to their smaller stature.

They competed in Pakistan's first-class tournaments between 1961–62 and 2002–03.\n1960s and 1970s.\nSargodha played their inaugural first-class match in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1961–62, defeating Peshawar by an innings. Saleem Akhtar, who later captained Sargodha, took 2 for 7 and 5 for 34. They did not win again until their first match in 1969–70, when they beat Lahore A by five wickets, Sherandaz Khan taking 11 for 86. Draws in their next two group matches enabled Sargodha to progress to the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy semi-finals, where they were beaten by Public Works Department. Sargodha beat Peshawar again in 1970–71, the captain, Humayun Farkhan, scoring 38 (second-top score) and 36 (top score) and taking 3 for 19 and 5 for 27 in a low-scoring match.\nThey reached the semi-finals of the Punjab Tournament in 1973-74 and 1974–75, then in 1975-76 two first-innings leads were enough to get them into the final, but they lost to Lahore A. They had their second innings victory in the BCCP Patron's Trophy in 1975-76 when Jalal Akbar took 11 for 59 against Pakistan Air Force. They won again by an innings in the BCCP Patron's Trophy in 1977–78 against the short-lived team from the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation.\n1980s to 2000s.\nIn 1984-85 they won three of their four group matches in the BCCP Patron's Trophy and finished at the top of their group, but lost in the semi-final by 32 runs to Rawalpindi. The captain, Arshad Pervez, hit three centuries, two of them in the semi-final, and finished with 492 runs in the five matches at an average of 70.28, while Aziz-ur-Rehman, with 34 wickets at 15.35, was the leading wicket-taker in the competition.\nThey next reached the finals of a competition in 1992–93, when they played off in the final of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, losing to Karachi Whites by an innings. Akram Raza, with 43 wickets at 18.90, was the leading wicket-taker in the competition. However, Sargodha finished winless at the bottom of the table in 1994-95 and lost their first-class status for three seasons.\nThey returned to first-class competition in 1998–99, but struggled to win matches. In 2002-03 they won only one of their five group matches, but it was enough to enable them to participate in the pre-quarter-finals of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, where they beat Lahore Whites. They were unlucky in their quarter-final against Rawalpindi. In a match ruined by rain they made 365 for 3 declared, the captain, Mohammad Hafeez, scoring a century, and had Rawalpindi 170 for 4 when play ended and Rawalpindi were declared the winners on run-rate. It was Sargodha's last first-class match.\nCurrent status.\nFaisalabad is about 80 kilometres south-east of Sargodha, on the other side of the Chenab River, so when Sargodha were one of six regional teams that were absorbed by stronger teams for the 2003–04 season, they merged with Faisalabad, who then proceeded to win the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy that season for the first time. Since Sargodha lost first-class status they have continued to compete in the annual Inter-District Senior Tournament against other teams from the Faisalabad region.\nPlaying record.\nOverall Sargodha played 163 matches in various first-class tournaments, winning 28, losing 56 and drawing 79. They also played 70 List A matches, winning 13 and losing 56, with one no-result.\nMost of Sargodha's home matches were staged at the Sports Stadium in Sargodha, which is now used for some of Faisalabad's home matches. It is also still used by Sargodha senior and junior teams in sub-first-class competitions.\nIndividual records.\nSargodha's highest individual score was 394, by Naved Latif against Gujranwala in 2000–01. It was the tenth-highest score in the history of first-class cricket. Sargodha's total of 721 was their highest.\nThe best bowling figures were 8 for 25 by Naeem Khan in 1986–87. State Bank of Pakistan needed only 119 to win, but Khan bowled them out for 54. The best match figures were 13 for 78 (7 for 47 and 6 for 31) by Aziz-ur-Rehman in a 268-run victory over Karachi Whites in 1989–90."

        "text": "The men's 1500 metres in short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics took place on 20 February at the Salt Lake Ice Center.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows:\nThe following new Olympic records were set during this competition.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round was held on 20 February. There were six heats of five skaters each, with the top three finishers moving on to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 20 February. The top two finishers in each of the three semifinals qualified for the A final, while the third and fourth place skaters advanced to the B Final.\nFinals.\nThe six qualifying skaters competed in Final A, while six others raced in Final B.\nControversy.\nIn the final race A, with one lap remaining and currently in second place, Apolo Ohno of the United States attempted to make a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung of South Korea, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to imply he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno, but the Australian referee James Hewish disqualified Kim for what appeared to be impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was \"absurd that the Korean was disqualified\". China's Li Jiajun, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: \"I respect the decision of the referee, I'm not going to say any more\". Australian Steven Bradbury, the 1000 m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: \"Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people will say it was right and a lot of people will say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too\".\nThe South Korean team immediately protested the decision of the chief official of the race, but their protests were denied by the International Skating Union (ISU). The South Korean team then appealed to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The IOC refused to see the case, stating, \"This is a matter for the ISU to decide on. At this time, the IOC has received no proposal and taken no action\". The CAS sided with the officials of the race as \"there is no provision in the short-track rule book for overturning a judgment call by the referee\" after the South Korean team asked to have a video replay be used to determine whether or not there was a rule violation.\nThe disqualification of Kim upset South Korean supporters, many of whom directed their anger at Ohno and the IOC. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the IOC's email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the IOC. South Korean media accused Ohno of simulating foul, using the Konglish word \"Hollywood action\". Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, \"I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot of my best friends were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me to stand on the pedestal as the anti-American sentiment\". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean soccer team scored a goal during the group stage match against the U.S. team, South Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to imply the other athlete had drifted into his lane."

        "title": "1993–94 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1993–94 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1993–94 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 22nd season as head coach. They played their home games at USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 19-12, 10-8 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1994 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the tournament final before losing to Providence. They were awarded a No. 9 seed in the Midwest Region of the 1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – Georgetowns 15th NCAA Tournament appearance in 16 years – and advanced to the second round before losing to the regions No. 1 seed, Arkansas.\nSeason recap.\nFour different underclassmen had started at shooting guard for the Hoyas during the previous season, and the lack of a reliable guard had hurt the Hoyas badly – so badly that their 14-year string of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances had finally come to an end, although they had made a run all the way to the final game of the 1993 National Invitation Tournament. To address the shooting guard issue, Thompson signed George Butler, who transferred from Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas, to play his junior year at Georgetown. With Butler on the team, Thompson changed Georgetowns offensive strategy from one of feeding the ball to a \"big man\" at center to an uptempo game by the teams guards, deemphasizing the role of sophomore centers Duane Spencer and Othella Harrington. In the season opener against Maryland, Butler scored 21 points and Harrington had 16 points and 15 rebounds, although Maryland won the game as freshman Terrapins forward Joe Smith debuted with a 26-point game.\nButler played in all 31 games and started 25 of them. He led the team in scoring in three of the first five games and in six games by mid-January 1994, and he scored in double figures 21 times, including a 26-point game against Boston College. For the season, he led the team in three-pointers and free throws and was second in scoring. Harrington, meanwhile, saw his performance decline under the new offensive scheme. Thompson started junior Don Reid at center during the first half of the season, relegating Spencer to the bench and moving Harrington to power forward. Harringtons reflexes tended to be too slow for the new uptempo offense, and his tendency to put the ball on the floor after receiving an inside pass instead of taking the ball straight to the basket also hindered him. By mid-January 1994, Harrington had led the team in scoring in only one game, and his scoring had dropped by 25 percent from the previous season, despite averaging over 30 minutes per game. However, Thompson then moved Harrington back to center, and his play improved. He scored in double figures in 14 of the last 15 games of the season, including a 27-point game against Syracuse, had 17-rebound efforts in two consecutive games, and scored a career-high 31 points at Madison Square Garden against St. John's in an important win in Georgetowns push to return to the NCAA Tournament. He finished as the team leader in scoring and rebounds.\nReid's first two seasons at Georgetown had been unimpressive; he had averaged 1.6 points per game in each of them with limited playing time. Starting at center during the first half of this season while Harrington played power forward, he finally began to excel. He had 11 points and 10 rebounds against Memphis State and a season-high 15 points and 11 rebounds in a game with Villanova. He rebounded in double digits five times, and he averaged 7.7 points and 5.9 rebounds per game for the year.\nSenior point guard and second-year team captain Joey Brown played in 30 games and started 29 of them, scoring in double figures 17 times. He had four double-doubles (double figures in scoring and assists), giving him a career total of six, and in the win over Nevada-Las Vegas he became the first Georgetown player to have 1,000 points, 400 rebounds, and 500 assists in his career. He led the team in assists in all but four games and averaged 10.0 points per game.\nSenior forward Robert Churchwell scored in double figures 15 times. His best performances were a 24-point game against Nevada-Las Vegas and 19 against Boston College, and he averaged 9.7 points per game.\nThe Hoyas received a bye in the first round of the 1994 Big East tournament, and defeated Boston College handily in the quarterfinals. Butler scored 24 points in an overtime win over Seton Hall in the semifinals and 18 points against Providence in the final before fouling out with 11:09 left in the game. With him out, the Hoyas had to rely on inexperienced guards for the rest of the game, and Providence took advantage of that to beat Georgetown for the tournament championship.\nGeorgetown returned to the NCAA tournament, its 15th appearance in the last 16 seasons, seeded ninth in the Midwest Region. The Hoyas upset No. 8 seed Illinois in the first round, with Butler scoring nine points in the first half and 18 in the second half for a career-high 27 points and Reid putting in a 15-point, seven-rebound effort. Two days later, the Hoyas lost to the regions No. 1 seed, Arkansas, the fourth straight time that Georgetown had exited the NCAA Tournament in the second round.\nGeorgetowns season opener against Maryland was the first meeting of the teams outside of a tournament since a December 5, 1979, game in which John Thompson and Maryland head coach Lefty Driesell had gotten into a shouting match at midcourt. The incident apparently had soured relations between the schools, which had a lengthy history of regular-season meetings before the 1979 game. The 1993 meeting raised hopes that the teams would resume regular meetings, but they did not schedule one another for a non-tournament regular-season game again until 2015.\nDePauls January 22, 1994, victory over Georgetown was the last time the Blue Demons defeated the Hoyas for 20 years. The following season, Georgetown would begin a 14-game winning streak against DePaul which the Blue Demons would not finally break until they upset the Hoyas in the first round of the 2014 Big East tournament in March 2014.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1993–94 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Unión Marplatense de Rugby",
        "text": "The Mar del Plata Rugby Union (), abbreviated URMDP, is the organisational body that rules the game of rugby union in Mar del Plata town and cities of the south of Buenos Aires Province. The stadium of Villa Marista is used for rugby matches played by the Union representative side.\nApart from Mar del Plata, the Union has teams from the cities of Balcarce, Dolores, Mar de Ajó, Miramar, Necochea, Tandil and Villa Gesell. The union was founded in 1951, and become a member of the Argentine Rugby Union that same year.\nHistory.\nOne of the first rugby union games held in Mar del Plata was played in 1925 by the British battleship \"Repulse\"'s crew and a team composed of employees of Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway that travelled to Mar del Plata specially for the occasion. A chronicle published on local newspaper \"La Capital\" described the match as follows:\nThe Mar del Plata Rugby Club was the pioneer in the city, having been established on 13 July 1944. Some of the enthusiasts that made the arrangements for its foundation were Rodolfo Tonneti, José Galarce, and Alberto Hernández, some of them with a past in clubs Curupaytí and Hindú.\nThe first committee was formed in Hernández's house, appointing Rómulo Tamini as president of the club. The team started to practise at the beach, then moving to Campo Municipal de Deportes (Municipal Sports Field). In the spring of 1945, Buenos Aires clubs CUBA and Pucará visited the city.\nAs the city did not have other club than Mar del Plata RC, it only played friendly matches with clubs from neighbor cities such as Independiente (Tandil), Ita-Carú and Duperial. On 25 May 1949 a tournament was held in the city, with Mar del Plata RC, Curupaytí, Pucará and Obras Sanitarias.\nTo help the spread of the sport in the city, rugby union was added to programs of Nacional, Comercial and Industrial Schools, with the collaboration of Physical education teacher Carlos Vecchio. In 1950 the first \"Marplatense\" championship was held, with Mar del Plata RC and the aforementioned schools contesting the competition. One year later, Bigua RC (a club founded by Jorge Alvear, another teacher of Peralta Ramos Institute) added to competitions. Other clubs added later would be General Pueyrredón and Escuela de Artillería Antiaérea (then renamed \"Santa Bárbara\").\nIn August 1951 the first rugby sevens competition was organised as part of the \"Second Olympic Games of Mar del Plata\", with 13 teams. All the matches were held in the Municipal Park. That would be the first step to form a body, \"Unión de Rugby de Mar del Plata\", on 27 October 1951 with Alberto Hernández (that had also been the first president of pioneer Mar del Plata RC in 1944) as president. The emblem chosen was a four-leaf clover with the founding members (Mar del Plata RC, Comercial, Nacional, Industrial and Bigua) colors, red, green, light blue and dark blue.\nAt the beginning of 1952, two rugby fields were built in Parque Camet. Those fields (currently owned by the Municipality) have been used as Mar del Plata RC venue up to present days.\nClubs.\nAffiliated clubs as of July, 2019:\nCompetitions.\nClubs from URMDP compete in \"Torneo Regional Pampeano\" (TRP), contested by teams from the Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires South and Buenos Aires West Unions. The last TRP winner is Sociedad Sportiva of Bahía Blanca.\nThe TRP is composed of two stages, \"Clasificatorio\" and \"Campeonato\". The first stage is contested by 8 teams, playing in a single round-robin tournament. At the end of the tournament, the six best placed teams qualify for the \"Torneo Campeonato A\", playing in a double round-robin where the team that totalised most points is crowned champion.\nTRP also has second and third divisions (named \"TRP B\" and \"TRP C\" respectively). Only two clubs from Mar del Plata has won this competition to date, Sporting (five times) and Mar del Plata RC (four times). \nThere is also a women's rugby competition.\nThe URMDP representative side competed in defunct Campeonato Argentino, having won its only title in 1961."

        "title": "1918–19 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1918–19 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1918–19 NCAA college basketball season. John O'Reilly coached the team in his fifth season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. Amid the raging Spanish influenza pandemic, the Hoyas met only local teams and played a shortened season, which they finished with a record of 9-1.\nSeason recap.\nOn-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses, and Georgetown averaged no more than three road games a year from this season through the 1926-27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum. The 1918-19 teams only road trip outside of Washington was to Annapolis, Maryland, to play a game at Navy.\nThe 1918–1919 season took place in between a second and third wave of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, the so-called \"Spanish flu.\" In response to the second wave, which spread during September 1918, the District of Columbia government shut down most public activities for a month during September and October, and all team sports at Georgetown went into hiatus during that month. After a shortened football season in 1918, Georgetown turned its attention to basketball, but the customary early December start of the basketball season was delayed, and Georgetown basketball did not begin play until January 1919. To avoid playing during a possible third wave of the pandemic in the spring of 1919 — which, in fact, did occur — Georgetown's schedule was limited to 10 games, which the team completed in only 36 days, playing its final game on February 15, 1919. No Georgetown students died of influenza during the pandemic, but two former Georgetown basketball players — John Martin, a forward on the 1912–1913 team, and Alexander \"Pat\" Finnegan, a guard on the 1917–1918 team — died of it while serving in the U.S. armed forces during World War I, Finnegan shortly after receiving his United States Army commission.\nThe Hoyas home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 17 games at the end of this season, dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916-17 season; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923-24 season. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, giving the Hoyas a 10-game winning streak against George Washington – eight of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium – dating back to 1915.\nForward and team captain Fred Fees, a student at Georgetown University Law School, was in his third season with the Hoyas. A free-throw shooting specialist in an era when the rules of college basketball allowed teams to choose which player shot its free throws, Fees had exploited his free-throw prowess to establish himself as one of the top scorers in college basketball in the United States in each of his seasons with the Hoyas. This season he played in all 10 games and scored 163 points, averaging 16.3 points per game.\nFreshman forward Jack Flavin joined the team this season. He played in only six games but scored 54 points, an average of 9.0 points per game. He would become a starter the next season on his way to becoming one of the great Georgetown players of the era.\nFreshman guard Andrew \"Andy\" Zazzali also joined the team. He played in all 10 games and averaged 6.2 points per game, and with 62 points was second only to Fees in scoring for the season.\nOne of the teams scheduled games was cancelled, and its only loss was at Navy in the third game of the year. It won the last seven games of the season to finish with a 9-1 record. Because of the shortened season, varsity players were granted an additional year of college eligibility, allowing Georgetown to return all five starters from the 1918–1919 team for the 1919–1920 season. The 1918–1919 team′s .900 winning percentage was the best in Georgetown men's basketball history at the time, but the Hoyas would exceed it the following year.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\nSophomore forward Bill Dudack later served as the Hoyas′ head coach during the 1929-30 season.\n1918–19 schedule and results.\nSources\nNotes\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so the two games against a United States Army team from Camp A. A. Humphreys, Virginia, counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1918-19. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The Emporia State Lady Hornets basketball team represents Emporia State University and competes in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) of the NCAA Division II. On April 28, 2023, Brian Ostermann was announced as the eighth head coach.\nOverview.\nThe Lady Hornets annually play a nineteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule that includes one exhibition game between the Kansas Jayhawks or the Kansas State Wildcats, switching every other year. The conference schedule consists of playing every MIAA member at least once, some twice. Emporia State does, however, play the Washburn Ichabods in the rivalry known as the Turnpike Tussle and the Pittsburg State Gorillas twice a year.\nHistory.\nEmporia State's women's basketball program was established in 1974, one-hundred and eleven years after the university was founded. Since 1974, the Lady Hornets have belonged to three conferences. When the school was a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, they participated in the Great Plains Athletic Conference until 1976, Central States Intercollegiate Conference from 1976 to 1989, back to the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference from 1989 to 1991, and when the university was recognized as an NCAA Division II school in 1991, they joined the MIAA.\nEarly history.\nLinda Caruthers era: 1974–1976.\nLinda Caruthers became the program's first head coach, earning a 30–12 record over two seasons from 1974 to 1976. The inaugural game was a 73–52 win against the Washburn Lady Blues, a future-MIAA rival from Topeka, Kansas. ESU would then go on to lose their next game, and first loss of the program, to Fort Hays State – 61–80. For the next five seasons, Debbie Jones took over the helm of the program.\nDebbie Jones era: 1976–1981.\nDuring Jones' first year, the Lady Hornets went 10–10, but then improved to a 15–8 record the following year. For the next three seasons, the Lady Hornets had a combined record of 64–24, leaving Jones with an 89–43 record. While Jones was the head coach, Emporia State won three conference championships.\nVal Schierling era: 1981–1995.\nWhen Jones left after the 1980–81 season, Val Schierling took over as head coach for the Lady Hornets until 1995. In his first season, the Lady Hornets finished 17–10, winning the CSIC regular season championship. For the next three seasons, the Lady Hornets had successful seasons, going 49–35. In the 1985–1986 season, the Lady Hornets went 15–15 and the next season went 11–15, making it the first losing season since the program started.\nAfter the 1986–87 season, the Lady Hornets had only three winning seasons from 1987 to 1988 and again from 1989 to 1991. From 1991 to 95, Schierling had a combined record of 45–64. After three consecutive losing seasons, Schierling was fired after the 1994–1995 season. Schierling is the second all-time winningest coach in Emporia State History with a record of 212–182 ().\nCindy Stein era: 1995–1998.\nAfter the firing of Val Schierling, Cindy Stein accepted the position as head coach. While Stein only coached for three years at ESU, she was able to turn the program around. In her first season, she went 12–14, quickly turning it around to 20–10 the following season, its first winning season since 1991. In her third and final season at Emporia State, Stein led the program to its first conference regular season and tournament championships, as well as the program's first trip to the NCAA Women's Division II Basketball Championship. Stein left to become the head coach of the Missouri Tigers, leaving Emporia State with a 65–25 record.\nBrandon Schneider era: 1998–2010.\nAfter being an assistant coach for three years, Schneider was promoted to head coach after Stein left for the University of Missouri. In Schneider's 12 years at the helm, he became the winningest coach in Emporia State history with a record of 306–72. With that record, Schneider lead the Lady Hornets to six MIAA regular season championships, three MIAA tournaments championships, four Regional championships, as well as Emporia State's first NCAA Division II National Championship in any sport. Schneider lead the Lady Hornets to 12 NCAA Tournaments, seven MIAA regular season championships, four MIAA Tournament championships, four NCAA II South Central Regional championships, and two NCAA II Final Four appearances.\nIn Schneider's first three seasons, he compiled a record of 86–9 overall, and 48–4 in conference play. In those three seasons, Schneider lead the Lady Hornets to three consecutive regular season and conference tournament championships, and to the NCAA Sweet 16 all three years, the Elite 8 All three years, and the Final Four one year. The 2001–02 season was Schneider's only season with less than 20 wins, and not making the post season.\nFollowing his lowest record, Schneider quickly turned the team around. From 2002 to 2006, Schneider lead the Lady Hornets to 20 plus win seasons, and a trip to either the NCAA Sweet 16 or the NCAA Elite Eight. In 2003–04, Schneider led the team to its 5th conference regular season championship since joining the MIAA in 1991, and Schneider's third conference championship. In both the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, Schneider led the team to the NCAA Regionals. Between 2004 and 2009, the Lady Hornets had a combined record of 125–46 overall, 72–25 in conference play, won two conference championships in 2007 and 2008, and advance to the NCAA Tournament each of those years.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Schneider's final season, the Lady Hornets finished with a 30–5 record, 16–4 in conference play, and on to win the NCAA Women's Division II Basketball Championship. The Lady Hornets finished second in the conference regular season and tournament, and won the South Central Regional tournament.

In his seven seasons at helm of the Lady Hornets program, Collins has gone on to win five consecutive MIAA Conference tournaments (2013–2017) and has a combined record of 190–50 overall and a 115–37 record in the MIAA. He is the first coach in Emporia State history to advance to seven conference tournament championships and five regional championships in six years. Collins left to join Schneider at the University of Kansas in March 2018.\nIn his first season, Collins led the team to a 20–9 overall, and 15–7 conference winning season. He led them to the MIAA Tournament title game, which they lost to the Northwest Missouri Bearcats. Collins led the team to a 23–9 overall, and 14–6 conference winning season in the 2011–12 season.

The Lady Hornets went to the NCAA Regionals, in which they again beat Fort Hays State in the Finals to move on to the Elite Eight. Collins then led the team to the Final Four, where they lost to the California Vulcans. In post-season honors, Collins won the Kansas Basketball Coaches Association \"Coach of the Year\".\nEntering into the 2015–16 season, the Lady Hornets were chosen as the national favorite in both the D-II Bulletin Preseason National Poll and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, as well as the MIAA polls. The first loss of the season came in December against Fort Hays State, where the Tigers defeated Emporia State 71–70. The Lady Hornets would then go on to lose four more times by 15 or less points.

The Lady Hornets won their fifth straight MIAA Conference Tournament Championship, and finished the postseason losing the Sweet 16 to Harding.\nThe 2017–18 season brought some challenges to the Lady Hornets basketball team. Two of the team's seniors were out with knee and ankle injuries that occurred prior to the season. Collins led the Lady Hornets to an overall record of 17–11, and 11–8 conference record, ending a five-consecutive MIAA Tournament championship streak and marking the first time the Lady Hornets did not make the NCAA postseason since 2011.\nToby Wynn era: 2018–2023.\nOn April 6, 2018, Toby Wynn was announced as the seventh head basketball coach.

In 2008, White Auditorium received an upgrade with a new scoreboard, video board, and a new paint scheme on the basketball court.\nSchool colors.\nEmporia State's official school colors are black and gold. They have been the colors since the school was founded in 1863, and until recently, the gold was Old gold.\nMascot.\nCorky the Hornet is Emporia State University's mascot. In 1923 when the Emporia State was named to the Kansas State Teachers College, the athletic teams were called the \"Yaps\". Many people, including former men's basketball coach Vic Trusler, did not like the name. Trusler suggested to a writer at the \"Emporia Gazette\" that the new name should be the \"Yellow Jackets\". But due to the lack of newspaper space, the name changed to \"Hornets\".\nIn 1933, the Teachers College had a student contest where students and staff could design a mascot for the college. Sophomore Paul Edwards, who graduated in 1937, designed Corky. Although hundreds of drawings were submitted, Edwards' Corky, a \"human-like\" hornet was selected. Corky was published in \"The Bulletin\", the student newspaper for Emporia State University."

John O'Reilly coached the team in his third season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 8-4.\nSeason recap.\nThe Hoyas victory over Bucknell on the last day of the season began a home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium that would reach 52 games before finally coming to an end during the 1923-24 season. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, giving the Hoyas a six-game winning streak against George Washington – five of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium – dating back to 1915.\nA graduate of St. Francis College of Pennsylvania, where he had played basketball, forward Fred Fees enrolled in Georgetown University Law School and joined the team – permitted despite his undergraduate playing time under the eligibility rules of the era – for the first of four seasons with the Hoyas. A free-throw shooting specialist in an era when the rules of college basketball allowed teams to choose which player shot its free throws, Fees exploited his free-throw prowess to establish himself as one of the top scorers in college basketball in the United States in each of his seasons with the Hoyas. This season he scored 195 of the teams 450 points, averaging 15.3 points per game to lead the team in scoring. He also shot 17-for-21 from the free-throw line in a game against George Washington, setting a school record for free throws made in a single game that no Hoya would exceed for 75 years.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\nTrinity College of North Carolina was the future Duke University.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "Khairpur cricket team",
        "text": "Khairpur cricket team, from the town of Khairpur, Pakistan, in the district of Khairpur in the north of Sindh province, played in the Pakistan domestic first-class cricket competitions between 1958–59 and 1973–74. The team no longer plays first-class cricket.\nFirst-class history.\nKhairpur made their debut in the 1958–59 Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, playing Quetta in Sukkur. Khairpur won a low-scoring match by four wickets. Tahir Ali took 5 for 36 and 2 for 27, and Iqbal Sheikh took 3 for 31 and 5 for 23. Khairpur lost their next match and drew their third.\nIn 1959–60 they played only one match, losing to Hyderabad after being dismissed for 57, which was their lowest-ever total, in the first innings. In 1960–61 they formed a combined team with Hyderabad, which competed in the Ayub Trophy as Hyderabad-Khairpur, losing one match and drawing the other.\nResuming as an independent entity in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, Khairpur won their first match in 1961–62, beating Bahawalpur by 8 runs in another low-scoring match. Faqir Aizazuddin, the captain, top-scored in each innings with 29 and 53, and Tahir Ali took 3 for 24 and 4 for 31. Khairpur lost their next two matches. In the match against Lahore B they reached 150 for the first time, eventually being dismissed for 242.\nThey began 1962–63 with their highest-ever total, 321, against Multan, although in the end they narrowly escaped with a draw. Once again Aizazuddin top-scored in each innings, making 89 and 24, as well as taking three wickets. They won their next match, against Bahawalpur, by two wickets, thanks to outstanding performances by Aizazuddin, who made 31 and 101 (Khairpur's first century), and Abdul Aziz, who took 7 for 66 and 5 for 97.\nThey lost their next four matches over three seasons by large margins. Their only appearance in 1966–67 was in a combined Hyderabad-Khairpur-Quetta team, which lost its only match to East Pakistan in the Ayub Trophy.\nIn 1967–68 Khairpur played one match, a draw. In 1968–69 they began with a 200-run victory over Quetta in Sukkur. Aged only 12 years and seven months, and batting at number eight, Mohammad Akram made 111 in the first innings on his first-class debut. Tahir Ali took 6 for 44 and 4 for 51. In their next match they were trounced by Karachi, for whom Pervez Sajjad took 15 wickets in the match for 112 runs.\nKhairpur began 1969–70 with what was to be their last victory, and their only innings victory, when they beat Hyderabad Whites in Sukkur by an innings and 29 runs. Tahir Ali took 6 for 38 and 4 for 39, and Abdul Aziz took 4 for 27 and 5 for 68. They lost their three other matches that season by an innings.\nKhairpur's last 10 first-class matches resulted in eight losses by large margins and two drawn matches that ended with Khairpur nine wickets down in their second innings and a long way short of their target. But there were still some notable individual performances. Zafar Mahmood made 106 and 39 in the draw against Karachi Whites in 1971–72. In Khairpur's final first-class match, in 1973–74, Mohammad Akram, still only 17 years old but now batting at number three, top-scored in each innings with 39 and 102, although Khairpur still lost by an innings to Commerce Bank.\nIn their 28 first-class matches between December 1958 and December 1973 (not counting the three by combined teams) Khairpur won five, lost 17 and drew six.\nSeveral Khairpur players later played for the neighbouring team of Sukkur when it assumed first-class status in the 1974–75 season.\nNotable performances.\nFaqir Aizazuddin captained Khairpur in nine matches in the 1960s, three of which they won. He also played for a number of other teams, and toured England with Pakistan in 1967, but did not play any Tests. For Khairpur he made 595 runs at an average of 29.75, and took 12 wickets at 38.25. Zafar Mahmood was Khairpur's leading run-scorer, with 623 runs at 27.08 in 13 matches. Mohammad Akram made 464 runs at 27.29, and scored two of Khairpur's four centuries; he later played a few matches for Sukkur during its period as a first-class team between 1974 and 1987.\nTahir Ali played 24 matches for Khairpur, taking 98 wickets at an average of 19.64 with his left-arm spin and making 437 runs at 12.85, a useful contribution in a weak batting side. When a Khairpur Commissioner's XI played a first-class friendly match in Sukkur in 1967–68, he was the only Khairpur player selected; most of the others were Test players. He was Khairpur's leading wicket-taker. In 13 matches for Khairpur, Abdul Aziz took 60 wickets at 23.96 with his off-spin.\nCurrent status.\nThe team has continued to play at sub-first-class level. Currently it takes part in the Inter-District Senior Tournament, a three-day national competition.\nGrounds.\nKhairpur has never played its matches in the town of Khairpur. During its first-class period it played three matches at the Municipal Stadium in Sukkur, about 30 kilometres to the north, winning all three."

For the 2017/18 season, for the first time, the MIHL expanded to two divisions, with all four clubs providing a team for both divisions: the \"Bayani\" Division (i.e. AA) and the \"Mabuhay\" Division (i.e. B). \nThe winners of the MIHL CUP in the AA Bayani Division in 2017/2018 season were the Cricket Lighters. Team roster included: Jarrett (Jay) Laabs, Ryan Charland, Filip \"Donnie\" Lindgren, Jamie Booth, Gianpietro Iseppi\nCurrent teams.\nFormer teams.\nOther {Philippine teams, who have not played in the MIHL: \nSeasons.\nIn season X, the MIHL's final season, the winners of the MIHL CUP were the Cricket Lighters. Team roster included:\nJarrett (Jay) Laabs, Ryan Charland, Filip \"Donnie\" Lindgren, Jamie Booth, Gianpietro Iseppi\nSeason I.\nTeams for the inaugural season were Label 5, the Beavers, the Predators, and the Comets. The first-ever game was between Label 5 and the Beavers. Label 5 were to dominate the first season of league play, with an unbeaten regular-season record 7–0–2. The Predators and the Beavers came in second with the record of 3–4–2. The Comets came up last with a record of 2–0–7. Label 5 then continued its streak into the playoffs, winning the newly established Mall of Asia Cup with the help of Korean goaltender Joey Park. The first season's top scorers were Florian Paquelin (Label 5) and Andre Gan (Predators), both with 26 points. Florian Paquelin (Label 5) also had the most assists at 12 while Andre Gan (Predators) scored the most goals at 12. The top scoring defender was Rolf Beutel (Beavers) with 17 points. Top goaltender was Joey Park (Label 5) with an 87.8% save percentage.\nSeason II.\nThe Sharks replaced the Comets for the second season. There was also a major re-draft of players on three out of the four teams; the Predators opted to stay as they were. The Beavers dominated this season, with a record of 5–1–2. The Sharks came in second with a record of 3–4–2, followed by the Predators with a record of 3–4–1 and Label 5 in last place with a record of 3–5–1. With a midseason player reshuffle intended to reduce the Beavers’ domination, Joey Park, along with rookie Darrel Ashley on defense, led the last-place Label 5 to their second Mall of Asia Cup. The top scorers for this season were Rolf Beutel (Beavers) and Andre Gan (Predators) both with 26 points each. Andre Gan (Predators) also scored the most goals with 21. Rolf Beutel (Beavers) again was the top scoring defender and had the most assists. Joey Park was again the top goaltender with a save percentage of 87.5%.\nSeason III.\nThe third season saw the lengthening of the schedule to 22 games per year (with four playoff games) so that there would only be one season per year. The new format madeboth the semifinals and the finals best-of-two series. The Predators dominated the regular season with a record of 11–4–1. The Sharks came in second with a record of 8–8–1. Label 5 came in third with a record of 7–9–1 and the Beavers came in last with a record of 6–11–1. Label 5 faced the Beavers in the finals. Label 5, led by Florian Paquelin up front and Darrel Ashley back on the defense, won their third straight Mall of Asia Cup. Rolf Beutel (Beavers) again was the top scorer with 42 points and the top goal-scorer with 28 goals. Serge Bisson (Beavers) had the most assists with 21. Joey Park once again was the top goaltender of the league with a save percentage of 87.4%."

        "title": "1966–67 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1966–67 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team represented the University of Illinois.\nRegular season.\nA dark cloud loomed over the Fighting Illini's men's basketball team as the 1966-67 season commenced. An investigation revolving around a \"slush-fund\" program which provided funds to athletes within the basketball and football programs had come to the conclusion that many integral parts of the administration, coaching staff, as well as athletes, were culpable and should be punished. The basketball team was the first to feel the brunt of sanctions caused by the \"slush fund\". For the first few weeks of the season, the 1966-67 Illini team was proving to be one of the elite teams in college basketball. They had defeated Kentucky 98-97 at Kentucky in early December, a feat the Illini had done only one other time in their history. Prior to the revelations, the team's only loss was by 2 points at the hands of West Virginia on their home court in Morgantown. Then, just two days before Christmas, while the team awaited its Chicago Stadium game with California, three fifths of the starting lineup were declared ineligible.\nRich Jones, Ron Dunlap and Steve Kuberski never again played for Illinois, and Harry Combes and his assistant Howie Braun was forced to resign at the end of the season. The team that remained bonded together and defeated Cal, 97–87. Remaining starter Jim Dawson took over the scoring load from that point on, but the real surprise that night, and for the remainder of the season, was Dave Scholz.\nScholz, a 6-foot-7 sophomore from Decatur, had seen only limited action in the first five games of the season. From the Cal game and beyond, Scholz utilized his opportunity to play by becoming the second leading scorer on this team and the leading scorer the following two seasons. Not only did he become the leading scorer, he was also named a Helms Foundation first-team All-American each of his remaining years. The dismissal of the three starters also gave impetus to a Big 10 MVP award for Dawson.\nEventually, reality set in, and the Illini finished with a 12–12 record and a seventh-place finish in the Big 10. Based on the negative findings, Illinois was forced to hire a new athletic director and new head basketball coach. Gene Vance was hired to be athletic director and was asked to guide the Illini back to respectability.\nThe university began the investigation into the \"slush-fund\" as a good faith gesture to demonstrate to the Big Ten commissioners that they were willing to handle any negative consequences in-house. University President David D. Henry found that 12 active football and basketball players had received illegal aid, seven football, 5 basketball. It also found that 17 other athletes had received aid since 1962, totaling approximately $21,500. The salt in the wound came from Big Ten commissioner Bill Reed, who emphasized that, even though the university had completed its investigation and dismissed the parties involved, the conference would continue the investigation further and hand down a formal decision on March 4, 1967. The decision, after a fairly brief debate, made by the conference athletic directors, including ex-offenders Biggie Munn and Forest Evashevski, called for Illinois to fire Elliott, Combes and Braun or \"show cause\" why the university should not be suspended or dropped from Big Ten membership. Based on the fact that the committee making the decision was made up of several members who had been guilty of infractions themselves, President Henry became outraged. The university appealed the decision while \"friends of the coaches\" began circulating petitions with hopes of pressuring the school into keeping them regardless of the consequences. On March 18, the Big Ten issued its ultimatum to the University of Illinois. In a statement from the commissioner, it was demanded that the implicated coaches be fired or the school could face an indefinite suspension. When the dust settled, football coach Pete Elliott and basketball coaches Combes and Braun all had their existing contracts terminated on August 31, 1967.\nCombes finished his 20-year career with 316 wins, three conference titles (1949, 1951, and 1952) and his 1963 team sharing a portion of the Big Ten Championship with Ohio State. Along with the conference championships, Combes' teams finished the NCAA Tournament in third place three times and in the Elite Eight once during his tenure.\nThe 1966-67 team's starting lineup included Deon Flessner and Benny Louis at the forward spots, Dawson and Preston Pearson as guards and Scholz at center.\nSchedule.\n \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season\n "

        "text": "The 1926–27 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1926–27 NCAA college basketball season. John O'Reilly coached it in his 11th and last season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 5-4.\nSeason recap.\nDuring the mid-1920s, the Georgetown men's basketball program was struggling to survive. Faculty members opposed players missing classes for road games. Furthermore, on-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses and limiting Georgetown to a very limited road schedule between the 1918-19 season and this season – often limited to an annual trip to Annapolis, Maryland, to play at Navy and sometimes a single trip to New York or Pennsylvania to play schools there – averaging no more than three road games a year in order to keep travel expenses and missed classes to a minimum. The 1926-27 team played only nine games; its only road game was a visit to Annapolis to play Navy and its planned three-game road trip to New York City at the end of the season was cancelled. It had a winning season in its limited schedule, opening 4-0, then losing four straight, and winning its final game to finish at 5-4.\nJunior forward Bob Nork had emerged as a top scorer previous season, and he starred again this year. He played in all nine games, playing a major role in almost all of them, and scored 85 points – almost twice as many as the teams second-leading scorer – averaging 9.4 points per game.\nHead coach John O'Reilly retired after this season, having coached Georgetown men's basketball for eleven of the past thirteen seasons. He had posted an overall record of 87-47 and had overseen many of the teams early triumphs, including a 52-0 record at home in Ryan Gymnasium from the last game of the 1916-17 season to the middle of the 1923-24 season that saw the defeat of top-rated visitors such as North Carolina (twice), Georgia Tech, and Kentucky, as well as 15 of the 19 consecutive Georgetown victories over crosstown rival George Washington between 1915 and 1924. He had simultaneously served as head coach of Georgetowns baseball and track teams, and he remained with the school to coach these teams until 1931.\nAlthough the team would continue to use Ryan Gymnasmium as a practice facility, this season was its last as the Hoyas home court. When new head coach Elmer Ripley took charge the following season, Georgetown Athletic Director Lou Little allowed him to schedule home games off campus for the first time since the 1913-1914 season in order to generate greater revenue to pay for travel expenses. The Hoyas would play their home games off campus for 22 seasons until the opening of McDonough Arena for the 1951-52 season brought home games back to campus.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.\n1926–27 schedule and results.\nSources\nIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so had the cancelled game against the Crescent Athletic Club been played, it would have counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1926-27. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\nGeorgetowns defeat at Navy this season was its 15th straight loss to the Midshipmen. The Hoyas finally would break the losing streak the following season, when they would beat Navy for the first time since 1909.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

He was the starting quarterback for Bay City for three years, earning All-American status as a senior.\nHis first start for Texas was a 21–13 win over Baylor in 1995 where he replaced an injured James Brown, a win that helped Texas win the last Southwest Conference championship. His second start, again in place of an injured James Brown, was in the 1997 UCLA game, which Texas lost 66-3 - the second worst loss in Texas history.

They competed in Pakistan's first-class tournaments between 1953–54 and 1978–79.\n1953–54 to 1964–65.\nCombined Services were one of the seven teams that competed in the first season of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1953–54. They dominated their first match, against Karachi, Mohammed Ghazali scoring 160. In their second match their total of 405 was not enough to secure a first-innings lead against Bahawalpur, who proceeded to the finals and won the trophy. Combined Services then made a short tour of India and Ceylon, where they won the only first-class match, against the Ceylon Cricket Association.\nThey played a match against the touring Indians in 1954–55, losing by an innings. They were more successful in that season's Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, reaching the final, where they lost by nine wickets to Karachi, for whom the Mohammad brothers Wazir, Hanif and Raees, all scored centuries. They drew a match against the touring MCC in 1955–56, Shujauddin making 147 and taking 6 for 71.\nCombined Services easily won their first two matches in 1956–57, against East Pakistan Greens and East Pakistan Whites in Dacca. When they dismissed East Pakistan Whites for 33, Miran Bux took 6 for 15. They were in turn beaten by an innings by Punjab, Fazal Mahmood taking 6 for 33 and 9 for 43 and top-scoring with 91.\nIn 1958–59, with one victory and two first-innings leads in drawn matches, they again reached the final of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy. Once again they lost to Karachi, this time by 279 runs, Hanif Mohammad scoring another century. They also reached the semi-finals in 1959–60. They played in the inaugural Ayub Trophy tournament in 1960–61, when there was no Quaid-i-Azam Trophy tournament, losing their only match.\nWhen the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy returned in 1961-62 it was in a group format rather than a knock-out format. In their first match Combined Services lost to Rawalpindi in a low-scoring match despite the efforts of Shujauddin, who took 4 for 31 and 6 for 69 and made 68 (Combined Services' top score) and 31 (second-top score). But they won their next four matches and reached the final again. Batting first against Karachi Blues, Imtiaz Ahmed and Shujauddin put on 269 for the first wicket, Imtiaz going on to score 251. After taking a first-innings lead Combined Services were dismissed for 143, and Karachi Blues were able to score the 217 required for victory for the loss of six wickets. It was Combined Services' third and last appearance in a final. Shujauddin was the most successful bowler in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1961–62, taking 48 wickets at an average of 11.14. He took 4 for 8 and 8 for 53 against Lahore A.\nCombined Services won two matches and lost one in 1962–63. In the victory over Peshawar, Munir Malik took 7 for 39 and 4 for 39, as well as making the second-top score of 32 in the first innings. They drew their only match in 1963–64, then won one and lost one in 1964–65, when Nayyar Hussain took 5 for 25 and 6 for 61 and top-scored in each innings with 57 and 28 in a four-wicket victory over Sargodha, then took 7 for 55 and 1 for 63 and top-scored with 58 and then second-top-scored with 46 in a three-wicket loss to Lahore Education Board.\n1976–77 to 1978–79.\nBetween December 1964 and February 1977 Combined Services played no first-class cricket. They returned in the 1976–77 season, captained by Nayyar Hussain at the age of 41, to play in the BCCP Patron's Trophy. They played four times in the next three seasons, winning once, losing twice and drawing once. They also played in the BCCP Invitation Tournament in 1978–79, losing their only match.\nPlaying record.\nOverall Combined Services played 33 matches in various first-class tournaments, winning 14, losing 11 and drawing 8. They played three other first-class matches, winning 1, losing 1 and drawing 1. They also played a match in India in 1954–55 in a combined team with Bahawalpur, losing to Bombay.\nNotable players.\nImtiaz Ahmed played 41 Tests for Pakistan in the 1950s and early 1960s. He played 26 matches for Combined Services, captaining the team in most of these matches, and scored 1864 runs at an average of 43.34. In the same period Shujauddin played 19 Tests, and 27 matches for Combined Services, in which he scored 1407 runs at 30.58 and took 122 wickets at 15.44.\nOther Combined Services players who played Test cricket in the 1950s and early 1960s included Abdul Hafeez Kardar (the first captain of both the Pakistan Test team and Combined Services), Waqar Hasan, Mohammed Ghazali, Miran Bux and Munir Malik. The only Combined Services player from the 1970s who played Test cricket was Naushad Ali."

        "text": "The 1988–89 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1988–89 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 17th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 29–5, 13–3 in Big East play. They finished as the Big East regular season champions and won the 1989 Big East men's basketball tournament, the sixth Big East tournament championship in Georgetown men's basketball history, defeating Syracuse in the final game. They were the No. 1 seed in the East Region of the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 11th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and advanced to the East Region final before losing to the region's No. 2 seed, Duke. They were ranked No. 2 in the season's final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll.\nPlayer summaries.\nSince Patrick Ewing's graduation in May 1985, Georgetown had struggled to find a suitable replacement at center; sophomore Grady Mateen had been ineffective at the position in the 1985–86 season and had transferred to Ohio State after that year, while his successor Ben Gillery, who played in 1986–87 and 1987–88, had lacked offensive skill and seen only limited playing time. However, two talented centers joined the team this season. Freshman Alonzo Mourning, viewed nationally as \"the next Patrick Ewing,\" arrived, and great things were expected of him and, because of him, for Georgetown men's basketball as a whole. Unheralded sophomore Dikembe Mutombo, a native of Zaire, in contrast, had spent his freshman year playing only intramural basketball in order to settle into life in the United States and focus on his academic studies and English language skills. Without any press attention, he was a virtual unknown outside of the Georgetown campus during his freshman year, and arrived on the varsity team for his sophomore season as a surprise to sportswriters and opposing teams. Mourning and Mutombo were among five future National Basketball Association (NBA) players on the 1988–89 squad.\nUnaccustomed to American collegiate basketball, Mutombo appeared in 33 of the team's 34 games but started none of them and saw only limited playing time, averaging 11 minutes per game while he became acclimated to the college game in the United States. Although he averaged only 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game for the season, these figures belied the scoring and defensive prowess he displayed on the court. Opponents found his close-range shots virtually impossible to stop, and he broke a 22-year-old school record with a 70.7% shooting average from the field; he scored in 23 games, and shot 100% from the field in ten of them. On defense, he showed himself to be a skilled shot blocker; never taught in Zaire to jump in anticipation of an opponent's shot, he simply stood his ground and waited for the opponent to commit to a shot before rising to swat it away. He blocked 75 shots during the season, and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record with 12 shots blocked in a single game against St. John's. Despite his prowess, Mutumbo served solely as Mourning's backup; it would take an additional year before Thompson realized that Mourning and Mutumbo should be playing in the starting lineup at the same time.\nMourning, meanwhile, started all 34 games, averaging 29 minutes per game, and became a consistent scoring threat. Although he averaged only eight shots per game and led the team in scoring only six times, he averaged 13.2 points (along with 7.3 rebounds) per game. In his third game, playing against Saint Leo, he unofficially had the first triple double in Georgetown history. In his first ten games, he averaged 5.7 blocked shots per game, and in his eleventh, against Miami on January 7, 1989, he had 26 points, 17 rebounds, and six blocks. By the end of the season, he had blocked an NCAA-record 169 shots.\nSenior guard Charles Smith closed out his college career with his best season. The Hoyas top scorer for the year, he scored a combined 117 points at the Capital Centre in Georgetown's first five home games of the year. Two of his top offensive performances of the regular season came in Georgetown's most exciting games of the year. With Thompson sitting out the game to protest NCAA Proposition 42 and Georgetown falling 14 points behind in the second half, Smith scored 35 points at Providence to lead the Hoyas to a comeback 80–77 victory, including the winning basket with five seconds left in the game. At Louisiana State ten days later before the largest crowd in NCAA history and with a possible No. 1 ranking on the line for the second-ranked Hoyas after Arizona's loss earlier in the week, he scored 32 points as the Hoyas came back from 10 points behind to take a four-point lead with 2:08 left in the game; unfortunately for the Hoyas, the Tigers tied the game and, after they put up a shot with five seconds left that missed, LSU forward Ricky Blanton tipped the ball in to give the Tigers an 82–80 victory. Fifteen days after that, Smith scored 22 at Pittsburgh. He would finish the year averaging 18.7 points per game.\nSenior guard Jaren Jackson had emerged as a top scorer in the last few games of the previous season after almost three years as a reserve, and he won a starting position this season, starting all 34 games. After averaging 16 points per game during the non-conference games of November and December 1988, he opened the Big East regular season with a 27-point performance against 10th-ranked Seton Hall. At Louisiana State he had a season-high 28 points, and he scored in double figures 20 times. He averaged 12.3 points per game for the year.\nAfter a difficult sophomore year in which he had been demoted to the bench, junior guard Dwayne Bryant became a starter again this season. He played in all 34 games and started 32 of them, shooting 50% from the field overall and 43% from three-point range. He led the Hoyas in scoring in two big regular-season Big East games against Boston College and St. John's.\nJunior guard Mark Tillmon slumped during the season, averaging only four points per game through early January 1989 and losing his starting job to Jackson; he appeared in 32 games but started only three of them. After Big East play began, however, he became one of Georgetown's top scorers off the bench, with 14 points in each of the Hoyas' two regular-season games against Boston College and 18 points in the season finale against archrival Syracuse. He ended the season averaging 8.3 points per game.\nTeam season recap.\nThe Hoyas finished in first place in the Big East's regular season, the second time in three seasons and fourth time in school history that they had finished in first or tied for first. They won the 1989 Big East tournament, defeating fifth-ranked Syracuse in the final for the sixth Big East tournament championship in Georgetown history. Charles Smith averaged 22 points per game over the Hoyas' three tournament games.\nThe Hoyas were the No. 1 seed in the East Region of the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 11th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. In their first round game against Ivy League champion Princeton, Smith shot only 2-for-12 from the field and the Hoyas barely escaped an upset. Princeton employed a 1950s-era offense and scored 14 of their 21 field goals off of layups off back-door screens, and, after Mourning blocked a last-second Princeton shot that some observers believed should have been called a personal foul against him, Georgetown barely eked out a 50–49 victory. In the second round, Smith scored 34 points to lead Georgetown to a win over Notre Dame, but he twisted his ankle, and the injury made him ineffective in the East Region semifinal against North Carolina State, in which he scored only a single point. Bryant scored a team-high 24 points and Jackson scored 17, however, and the Hoyas again emerged with a victory.\nIn the East Region final, Georgetown faced the region's No. 2 seed, Duke. Smith scored 21 points and Tillmon 16, but Jackson managed only 1-for-10 shooting from the field. The Blue Devils, led by Danny Ferry and freshman Christian Laettner built an early lead that they never relinquished, and they knocked the Hoyas out of the tournament, bringing Georgetown's season to an end, with the 77–85 loss. The Hoyas were ranked No. 2 in the season's final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll behind only Arizona.\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, Duke's defeat of Georgetown signaled a change in the balance of power in men's college basketball. While Duke was on the rise entering the 1990s, the Hoyas' era of dominance was beginning to come to a close. Georgetown would not win the Big East tournament again until the 2007–08 team won in 2008, and before the 2007–08 team's Final Four appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament, the Hoyas would make an Elite Eight appearance only once, when the 1995–96 team advanced to the East Region final of the 1996 NCAA tournament.\nRoster.\nSource\nFreshman guard Ronny Thompson was the son of head coach John Thompson, Jr.\nRankings.\nSource\n1988–89 Schedule and results.\nSources\nThe 66,144 people who attended the game the Hoyas played against Louisiana State at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 28, 1989, set the record for the largest crowd ever to attend a game involving Georgetown.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The 1987–88 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1987–88 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 16th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 20-10, 9-7 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1988 Big East men's basketball tournament, but they lost to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals. They advanced to the second round of the 1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament before losing to Temple.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore guard Mark Tillmon had shot only 39% from the field the previous season, but he improved to 47% this year and became the second Georgetown player to shoot 40% or better from three-point range since the institution of the three-point shot the previous year. He was the teams top scorer in three non-conference and six Big East games. Sophomore guard Dwayne Bryant, meanwhile, led the team in assists but otherwise had a difficult season, starting only 16 games, shooting only 37% from the field, and scoring in double figures only twice. He would, however, make a remarkable comeback the next season.\nAfter spending his freshman and sophomore years as a reserve shooting guard with only modest success, senior and team co-captain Perry McDonald had moved to forward during his junior season and emerged as one of Georgetowns top scoring threats, rebounders, and defenders. When he returned from playing on a gold-medal United States team at the World University Games in the summer of 1987, it seemed to observers that he was poised to be the major driver of Georgetowns 1987-88 offense. However, Thompson chose to emphasize the offensive play of Georgetown guards on this seasons team, and McDonalds playing time fell by 10 percent. Despite this, he led the team in scoring six times and in rebounding 16 times. For the season, he averaged 10.1 points per game despite taking 70 fewer shots than the year before, and he also averaged 6.3 rebounds per game.\nJunior forward Jaren Jackson also had spent his first two years strictly as a reserve. This year, after an 0-for-9 effort from the field against Hawaii Loa in the seasons opening game, he recovered to score in double figures five times during December 1987. He then returned to limited duty as a reserve, starting only six games all season. His breakout game would not come until the very end of the regular season.\nLike McDonald and Jackson, guard Charles Smith had spent his first two years as an unheralded reserve, seeing only two starts in his first 63 games, but had suddenly and dramatically emerged at the end of the previous season as a potent offensive force in Georgetowns defeat of Ohio State in the second round of the 1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. After touring Australia with a Big East all-star team during the summer of 1987, leading that team in points, assists, and steals, he returned for his junior year with a transformed career, appearing in all 30 games and starting 16 of them, with 75 assists and 71 steals and averaging 15.7 points per game. In the first nine games of the season, he scored in double figures six times. After the Hoyas fell behind at Miami in the tenth game, Smith led the Hoyas in a comeback win in which he shot 8-for-12 from the field and scored 22 points. It began a 34-game streak across two seasons in which he scored in double figures in every Georgetown game for the next year and nine days.\nAs January 1988 wore on, Smith scored 20 points at DePaul and 21 at Boston College. On January 24 at Syracuse, Georgetown had come back from a nine-point deficit to take the lead, with Tillmon scoring 19 points and grabbing seven rebounds, when Syracuse guard Sherman Douglas scored a basket with nine seconds left in the game to give the Orangemen a 68-67 lead. Georgetown had no time-outs left and no time to set up a play, so with eight seconds remaining the 6-foot-0 (183-cm) Smith single-handedly took the ball from the backcourt, through the entire Syracuse defense, and to the basket, scoring the winning field goal with a finger roll to give the Hoyas a last-second 69-68 upset victory over the 14th-ranked Orangemen. In February, Smith had a 28-point performance at Seton Hall, and four days later the Hoyas pulled out another last-second upset win over now-11th-ranked Syracuse, beating the Orangemen 71-69 at the Capital Centre.\nThe Big East had developed a reputation for strong rivalries, physical play, and, increasingly, fighting. On January 6, 1988, Pittsburgh and Georgetown met at the Capital Centre and the 14th-ranked Hoyas upset the No. 2 Panthers. During the game, a fight broke out between Tillmon and Pittsburghs Nate Bailey, a benches-clearing brawl followed, and the teams came away from the incident bearing grudges against each other. On February 20, 1988, the Hoyas again met Pittsburgh, this time at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With four seconds remaining in the game and the Panthers leading 70-65, Perry McDonald and Pittsburghs Jerome Lane became entangled with one another while fighting for a rebound under the basket, and McDonald's elbow struck Lane. Lane responded with a roundhouse right, and McDonald – a two-time Gold Glove boxing champion in Louisiana – retaliated. Fights immediately also broke out between Hoya sophomore center Sam Jefferson and Pittsburgh senior forward Demetreus Gore and between Georgetown junior forward Johnathan Edwards and Panthers senior forward Charles Smith (not to be confused with Georgetowns Charles Smith), and another benches-clearing brawl ensued. Angry Pittsburgh fans came onto the floor, Thompson pulled the Hoyas off the court, and the game did not continue. Postgame, Thompson had to separate the teams when the fight almost resumed in the hallway between the opposing locker rooms. The ugly incident, coming on the heels of the fight at the Capital Centre the previous month, prompted Big East Commissioner Dave Gavitt to convene a committee to recommend measures to reduce fighting and other unsportsmanlike behavior in the conference. Sportswriters and opposing fans accused Georgetown players of being thugs, and Thompson took to the media to defend the team, saying that the fights were not entirely Georgetowns fault.\nThe Hoyas closed out the regular season with a double-overtime 102-98 win against Seton Hall in which Tillmon scored 35 points and pulled down eight rebounds. Jaren Jackson finally had his breakout game that afternoon; after nearly three seasons of limited play and limited scoring, he shot 12-for-17 (70.6%) from the field and 11-for-12 (91.7%) from the free-throw line to score a career-high 38 points. This final victory in regular-season conference play gave the Hoyas a 9-7 record and third-place finish in Big East play. They received a bye in the first round of the 1988 Big East men's basketball tournament, but they lost their first game of the tournament to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals.\nThe Hoyas were the No. 8 seed in the East Region of the 1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the 10th of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. In the first round, they faced the No. 9 seed, Louisiana State. Jackson continued his sudden emergence as one of Georgetowns top offensive threats, scoring 20 points. With the game tied 63-63 with three seconds left to play, Charles Smith got the inbounds pass after a Georgetown timeout and, unable to find an open teammate, put up a 30-foot (9.1-meter) shot that scored to give Georgetown a 66-63 last-second win. The win allowed the Hoyas to advance to the second round, in which the East Regions No. 1 seed and eventual champion, No. 1-ranked Temple, defeated them 74-53 in a game in which Jaren Jackson scored 13 points. Jacksons offensive surge in the final games of the year raised his average for the season to 8.7 points per game and changed his career, placing him in a position to excel the following season.\nBy the mid-1908s, brawls like those between Pittsburgh and Georgetown in the winter of 1988 had become an increasing problem in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's basketball games, with few consequences because of a lack of rules governing consequences for fighting. During the 1988 off-season, the NCAA established Rule 19, which mandated a one-game suspension for any player involved in an on-court fight and a season-long suspension for any player fighting a second time during the year. With Rule 19 – later renumbered as Rule 10.7 – in force, brawls have become rare.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1987–88 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

Elmer Ripley, who had coached Georgetown previously from 1927 to 1929, returned for his second of three stints as head coach; it was his third season overall as the Hoyas head coach. The team was a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (EIC) and played its home games at Tech Gymnasium on the campus of McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C. The team finished as conference co-champion, with a record of 6-4 in the EIC and 13-9 overall. It had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nSenior forward Joe Murphy was the teams star. He scored in double figures in nine games, including 14 points against Syracuse, 11 against Maryland, and 15 against EIC rival Penn State. He finished the season averaging a career-high 8.9 points per game. Over his career, he was the second-highest scoring Georgetown player of the 1930s and fifth-highest in school history at the time. He had scored in double figures in 17 of the 65 games of his three-year college varsity career.\nJunior forward John Schmitt scored 12 points in an upset of West Virginia in an EIC game. His season ended when he broke his leg during the game at Yale.\nGeorgetown finished with an overall record of 13-9, the most wins by a Georgetown team since the 1929-30 season and the best winning percentage since 1928-29. The school had been a founding member of the EIC when the conference began play in the 1932-33 season, and this years 6-4 conference record gave the school its first and only regular-season EIC championship – Georgetowns first championship of any kind – which it shared with Carnegie Tech. Although the EIC never held a postseason conference tournament, in previous seasons when the regular season had ended in a first-place tie it had held a single postseason playoff game between the two first-place teams to determine the conference championship. This season, however, no such playoff game took place, and Georgetown and Carnegie Tech settled for the only co-championship in EIC history.\nAlthough the Associated Press described the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference as \"one of the best in the nation,\" its members agreed to disband it at the end of the season because geographical problems had made scheduling difficult. Georgetowns overall conference record during its seven-year membership was 27-39.\nAt the end of the season, Georgetown thus became an independent again for the first time since the 1931-32 season. In 1939-40, the Hoyas would play their first of 38 seasons as an independent before becoming a founding member of the original Big East Conference in the 1979-1980 season.\nRoster.\nSources\nJunior guard Francis \"Reds\" Daly was killed in action in the Battle of Iwo Jima on February 22, 1945, during World War II military service.\n1938–39 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "2014 Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The 2014 Rugby Championship was the third edition of the expanded annual southern hemisphere Rugby Championship consisting of Argentina, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The tournament was won by New Zealand, with South Africa second, Australia third, and Argentina last.\nThe Championship began on 16 August with Australia hosting the defending champions, New Zealand, at the Stadium Australia in Sydney and South Africa hosting Argentina at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. The tournament continued for seven weeks, which included two byes, and concluded on 5 October with South Africa versus New Zealand at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg and Argentina versus Australia at Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza.\nOn 27 September, New Zealand clinched their third consecutive Championship after a bonus-point 34–13 win against Argentina in La Plata. The 2014 Rugby Championship was the first in which New Zealand failed to win all their matchesthey drew with Australia in Week 1 and lost to South Africa in Week 6. It also saw the first Championship-match win for Argentina who defeated Australia 21–17 in the last match of the tournament. \nFormat and standings.\nThe format for the 2014 tournament was the same as that for the 2012 and 2013 editions. Each side played the other once at home, and once away; giving a total of six matches each, and twelve in total. A win earns a team four points, a draw two points, and a loss no points. A bonus point can be earned one of two ways: by scoring four tries or more in a match, or by losing within seven points. The competition winner is the side with the most points at the end of the tournament, however if two sides finish equal on points the side with the most wins is placed higher.\nSummary.\nThe first match of the championship was between New Zealand (also known as the \"All Blacks\") and Australia (the \"Wallabies\") in Sydney, Australia. The fixture doubled as a Bledisloe Cup match, and ended as a 12–12 draw. The All Blacks started stronger, and led 9–3 at half time, but Australia were much better in the second half. New Zealand had two players temporarily sent-off after being awarded yellow cards, but Australia were unable to capitalize on that advantage during their late dominance. All points were scored from penaltiesfour from each side. The draw ended a 17-match winning streak by the All Blacks. The following week both side met in their second Bledisloe Cup match of the Championship (the third is played following the tournament), but this time at Eden Park in New Zealand. The match was comfortably won by New Zealand 51–20, whose scored six tries to Australia's two. The All Blacks were regarded as the more physical of the two teams, and scored two tries from mauls. The win meant that New Zealand retained the Bledisloe Cup (Australia needed to win the three-match series to regain the cup).\nThe second match of the tournament was between South Africa (the Springboks) and Argentina (the Pumas) and played at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, South Africa. South Africa won 13–6 and scored the only try of the match, which was played in wet and raining conditions. The following week the two teams met again, this time at Estadio Padre Ernesto Martearena in Salta, Argentina. The Springboks won again, but were considered lucky to get the 31–33 victory. At one stage Argentina were winning by 12 points, and were leading with five minutes remaining, but Springbok Morné Steyn kicked a penalty in the 76th minute to give South Africa the lead and the win.\nIn weeks three and four, Argentina and South Africa both travelled to Australasia for two away matches. Argentina played the All Blacks in Napier where they lost 28–9, before facing Australia on the Gold Coast where they lost 32–25. The Pumas loss to the All Blacks was played in wet conditions, with New Zealand scoring four tries, and Argentina three penalties. Argentina's loss to Australia was much closer than their defeat in New Zealand. Despite leading by 16 points after 60 minutes, Australia conceded twelve points in the final quarter. Argentina trailed by seven points, the value of a converted try, when they had a scrum deep within Wallabies' territory, but Australia were awarded a free-kick after the Pumas' scrum-half fed the ball too early and the game ended. In the third week the Springboks played Australia in Perth, where the Wallabies won 24–23. The Wallbies had trailed 23–14, but scored ten unanswered points after Springbok wing Bryan Habana, who was playing in his 100th test match, was yellow carded for a high tackle. The following week South Africa played the All Blacks in Wellington. The match was won 14–10 by New Zealand, but only after they resisted repeated South African attacks on their try-line late in the game. The win was the 36th consecutive victory for the All Blacks in New Zealanda record stretching back to 2009.\nThe last two weekends of matches were played in South Africa and Argentina. First up the Wallabies faced the Springboks in Cape Town, where South Africa won 28–10. The victory came after a ten-minute period at the end of the match where the Springboks scored three-tries. The same weekend Argentina faced the All Blacks in La Plata. For the New Zealanders the match was overshadowed by the omission of Aaron Cruden, who had missed the flight to Argentina, and was subsequently dropped from the squad for the last two weeks of the Championship. The All Blacks won 34–13, and with the bonus-point win took an unassailable lead in the Championshipgiving them their third Rugby Championship, and 13th overall since the inception of the Tri-Nations Championship in 1996.\nDespite New Zealand having secured the Championship title a week earlier, the final week of matches proved historic. The first match was the Springboks hosting the All Blacks at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. All Blacks' captain Richie McCaw played his 134th match for the side, surpassing the national record held by Colin Meads.

He was allowed to return to practice a few weeks later. He eventually pleaded guilty to the felony charge after missing one week.

Legs 1 and 2 are done by the women, legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are 6 km and men's legs are 7.5 km. Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane in the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five)."

Elmer Ripley coached it in his fifth of ten seasons as head coach; it was also the third season of his second of three stints at the helm. For the first time, the team played its home games at Riverside Stadium in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 16-4 and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nIn its previous ten seasons, Georgetown had a combined record of 32 games under .500, and going into this season the Georgetown student yearbook, \"Ye Domesday Book\", opined that the school would deemphasize or eliminate basketball by 1942 if the team's performance did not see significant improvement. The 1940–41 team rose to the yearbooks challenge, achieving the highest win total in history for a Georgetown men's basketball team.\nJunior guard Buddy O'Grady returned for his second varsity season and led the team. He scored a season-high 14 points against Army.\nAlso starring for the team was sophomore center Bill Bornheimer. The tallest player in Georgetown history at the time at , he had been the starting center of the freshman team the previous season and joined the varsity this year. A strong defender, rebounder, and inside shooter, he led the team in scoring, averaging 8.4 points per game. Before 7,000 fans at Riverside Stadium – a record home crowd for a Georgetown basketball game – he had a season-high 15 points as the Hoyas upset Temple 57–49 on February 10, 1941.\nFollowing a season-opening loss, the Hoyas won 11 games in a row and then five of their last eight, finishing with a record of 16–4. They narrowly missed invitations to the NCAA tournament and National Invitation Tournament and had no postseason play.\nRoster.\nSources\nTwo future Georgetown head coaches played on the team. Sophomore forward Ken Engles would leave school for World War II military service after the 1941-42 season, but would return to play for the 1945-46 team and also served as its head coach that season, the only player-coach in Georgetown men's basketball history. Junior guard Buddy O'Grady would coach the Hoyas from 1949 to 1952.\nJunior guard Don Martin served as head coach at Boston College from 1953 to 1962.\n1940–41 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

He combined with his taller teammate, fellow freshman center Duane Spencer, to average 25.5 points and 15.9 rebounds per game for the year.\nJunior forward Robert Churchwell also started all 33 games. He led the team in scoring in six games and finished the year as its second-highest scorer and third in rebounds. He had a career-high 25 points against Connecticut and a 16-point, 11-rebound game against Miami.\nJunior point guard and team captain Joey Brown missed only one game all season and started the other 32, scoring in double figures 20 times and leading the team in scoring three times. He tied the school single-season steal record set by guard Fred Brown in the 1980-81 season with 80 steals, and he had 199 assists, the fourth most in a single season in Georgetown history. In his best game of the year, he had 17 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, and four steals against Connecticut.\nAs the Big East season progressed, the lack of a reliable shooting guard hurt Georgetown. Four different underclassmen started at the position, and, with poor shooting from the field by guards John Jacques (36.2% in Big East play), Eric Micoud (34.3%), and Irvin Church (17.9%) plaguing the Hoyas, they lost eight of their last eleven conference games to finish the Big East regular season with an 8-10 record, good for only an eighth-place finish. In the Big East tournament, they defeated Miami in the first round but lost to ninth-ranked Seton Hall in the quarterfinal. Their 16-12 overall record at the end of the tournament, combined with their losing regular-season conference record and a weak non-conference schedule that included three non-Division I opponents, prevented them from receiving an invitation to the 1993 NCAA tournament, breaking a 14-season streak of NCAA Tournament appearances for Georgetown dating back to the 1978-79 season.\nGeorgetown instead received an invitation to the 1993 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) and made its first NIT appearance since the 1977-78 season. Harrington led the way, beginning the tournament by scoring 25 points and collecting 18 rebounds in a first-round win at Arizona State. In the second round, Georgetown met favored Texas-El Paso at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus (held there because NIT rules at the time required host teams to play tournament games on campus) and held the Miners to 15% shooting from the field in the first half and 25% for the game behind a strong defensive effort by Joey Brown, whose 16 points, five rebounds, three assists, and three steals led the team. The Hoyas then defeated Miami of Ohio in the quarterfinals. Harrington had 20 rebounds in the Texas-El Paso and Miami of Ohio games.\nIn the semifinals, the Hoyas met Alabama-Birmingham in a tough game dominated by defense. With 13:48 to play in the game, Alabama-Birmingham held a 38-22 lead, but the Hoya defense clamped down after that, held the Blazers to three points in the next four minutes and no points in the final 9:24. Harrington had 11 points and five rebounds and Churchwell shot 6-for-7 (85.7%) from the field and scored 15 points as the Hoyas came from behind to win 45-41.\nGeorgetown thus advanced to the NIT final for the first time in school history, facing Minnesota in the championship game, in which Harrington scored 17 points. With 4:27 left to play and Minnesota leading 62-53, the Hoyas made another defensive stand that prevented the Golden Gophers from scoring for the rest of the game, and Georgetown cut Minnesotas lead to 62-61. On the last play of the game, Georgetown sophomore forward Kevin Millen, having no reliable shooting guard to get the ball to, took a long shot from outside himself. It missed. The game ended with the Golden Gophers deflecting a late pass to Harrington, preventing him from attempting a final shot for the win, and Minnesota won 62-61. Although the Hoyas did not win the tournament championship, as tournament runners-up they had the best NIT finish in school history.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1992–93 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "Jeremy Johnson (born September 23, 1994) is an American football quarterback for the Caudillos de Chihuahua of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA). He played college football at Auburn.\nHigh school career.\nAfter a very successful football career at George Washington Carver High School, Johnson won the Mr. Football Award for best high school football player in the state of Alabama in 2012 after throwing for 3,193 yards and 31 touchdowns. He would go on to participate in the highly regarded U.S. Army All-American Bowl in January 2013. His jersey from Carver was retired on February 6, 2013.\nJohnson also starred on the Carver basketball team, earning consecutive first-team all-state honors and an Alabama Mr. Basketball nomination in his final year.\nJohnson committed to Auburn University on May 20, 2012, sticking with his commitment through the firing of Gene Chizik and subsequent hiring of Gus Malzahn as head coach of the Tigers.\nCollege career.\nJohnson came in as a freshman in 2013. He competed for the starting job against Nick Marshall, who became the starter for that season. On October 12, 2013, Johnson earned his first start against Western Carolina. He had 201 passing yards with four touchdowns and an interception. Two weeks later against Florida Atlantic, Marshall was injured again and Johnson replaced him as he had 192 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.\nWith starting quarterback Nick Marshall suspended for the first half of the 2014 season opener against division opponent Arkansas, Johnson served in his place completing 12 of 16 passes for 243 yards and two touchdowns within just the first half of the game. After Marshall served his suspension, however, Johnson's role throughout the rest of the 2014 season was clean-up duty against overmatched opponents.\nFollowing Nick Marshall's departure from the Auburn football program after the 2014 season, Johnson was named the starter for the 2015 season following spring practice. Many publications had Johnson listed as one of the favorites to win the Heisman trophy and lead Auburn to the CFP. However, the season got off to a rough start. Johnson threw three interceptions in the opening game against Louisville and two more against (FCS) Jacksonville State. Johnson was benched after another multi-turnover performance to rival LSU. Backup Sean White started the rest of the season, with Johnson being used sparingly. \nJohnson would appear in multiple games in 2016 but, with lackluster results once again. \nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, Johnson was invited to attend the New York Giants rookie minicamp as a tryout player. That summer, he hired an agent and trained in Miami with hopes of earning a professional basketball contract.\nOn March 3, 2018, Johnson signed with the Columbus Lions of the National Arena League (NAL). He was on the practice squad for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from June 28 to July 2, 2018.\nJohnson joined the West Virginia Roughriders of the American Arena League and made his debut with the team on April 15, 2019.\nIn November 2020, he signed with the Rarámuris de Ciudad Juárez of the Fútbol Americano de México (FAM) league ahead of the 2021 season.\nJohnson signed another FAM team, the Parrilleros de Monterrey, ahead of the 2022 season. In seven games, he threw for 1,538 yards and 16 touchdowns with six interceptions, earning team MVP honors.\nIn December 2022, Johnson joined the Caudillos de Chihuahua of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA), the top league in Mexico, after the FAM league shut down operations. He led the team to the best record in the league, finishing 10–0 in the regular season. Johnson then guided the Caudillos to a 10–0 victory over the Dinos de Saltillo in Tazón México VI. They became the first team in LFA history to complete a perfect season, doing it in their first year in the league. Johnson completed 156 of 260 passes for 2,465 yards and a league-leading 32 touchdowns with three interceptions.\nJohnson re-signed with the Caudillos de Chihuahua in February 2024."

        "text": "The 1991–92 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1991–92 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 20th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 22–10, 12–6 in Big East play, sharing the regular-season conference championship with Seton Hall and St. John's. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1992 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the final before losing to Syracuse. They were the No. 6 seed in the West Region of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the last of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and advanced to the second round before losing to West Region No. 3 seed Florida State. They were ranked No. 22 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 18 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetowns starting lineup of senior center and team co-captain Alonzo Mourning, sophomore basketball Robert Churchwell, senior forward Brian Kelly, sophomore point guard Joey Brown, and freshman guard Irvin Church was so talented that observers picked the Hoyas as a co-favorite to win the 1991-92 Big East regular-season title. With Dikembe Mutombo having graduated in May 1991, Mourning was now Georgetowns sole \"big man,\" and he led the team, starting and scoring in double figures in all 32 games and collecting rebounds in double figures in 22 games. He led the team in scoring in 27 games and in rebounding in 26.\nIn the first game of the year, Mourning had his second career triple double with 32 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots against Hawaii Loa in the Hawaii Loa Classic. Over the next two weeks, he fell just short of two more triple doubles, with 21 points, 22 rebounds, and nine blocked shots against Delaware State and 25 points, 14 rebounds, and five blocked shots in only 27 minutes of play against the University of the District of Columbia. He fell just short of a triple double again in the first Big East game of the year, with 24 points, 15 rebounds, and eight blocked shots against Villanova at the Capital Centre on January 4, 1992. He followed that up with 28 points and 12 rebounds against Providence and 23 points and 11 rebounds against Seton Hall. In the 16 Big East games Georgetown played during the regular season, Mourning averaged 20.7 points and 10.9 rebounds a game, and his expertise in shooting free throws was an important part of the Hoyas offense. His career-high 38-point performance in a double-overtime loss at Boston College included scoring on a school-record 18 free throws as he shot 69.2% from the free throw line in 26 attempts. Three days later, in a rematch in which the Hoyas upset Villanova, he again almost had a triple double against the Wildcats, scoring 26 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and blocking seven shots as well as shooting 14-for-15 (93.3%) from the free-throw line.\nChurchwells sophomore season was virtually a repeat of his freshman year. He shot 49% from the field overall and 38% from three-point range, and he made 120 field goals and had 153 rebounds, an increase of six and one, respectively, from the year before. Although he had only one shot per 3 minutes 32 seconds of playing time, he averaged 9.6 points per game.\nBrown improved his shooting from the field, from 23.1% the previous year to 35.2%, but made some of his biggest contributions on defense. On February 19, 1992, 25th-ranked Georgetown faced 21st-ranked Connecticut at the Capital Centre in an important game for the Hoyas for their chances both for a Big East regular season championship and for an NCAA tournament bid. The game was tied 58–58 with 13 seconds left to play and the Huskies holding the ball for the final shot when Brown stole a Connecticut pass and made a layup at the buzzer to give the Hoyas a 60–58 last-second upset win. At 17th-ranked Syracuse four days later, Brown scored 23 points to lead Georgetown to another upset win. Against Pittsburgh at the Capital Centre in the regular-season finale, he had a 17-point effort in a win that tied Georgetown with Seton Hall and St. John's for the regular-season Big East championship.\nAfter a bye in the first round, Georgetown defeated Miami in the quarterfinals of the 1992 Big East tournament and St. Johns in the semifinals. In the final game, the Hoyas met archrival Syracuse. The Hoyas fell 11 points behind the Orangemen in the second half, but the Hoyas, led by Mournings 23 points, came back to tie the game with 24 seconds left to play. Unfortunately for the Hoyas, Syracuse senior forward Dave Johnson connected on a shot with four seconds left to give the Orangemen a 54–52 win. It was Syracuses first defeat of Georgetown in a Big East tournament championship game in four tries. Mourning scored 76 points and 22 rebounds during the tournament, averaging 25.3 points per game, and was named the tournaments Most Valuable Player, becoming the first player ever named the Big East's Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, and Tournament MVP in the same season, and only the second Tournament MVP from a team that did not win the tournament.\nThe Hoyas were the No. 6 seed in the West Region of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the last of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA Tournament appearances. In the first round, they defeated South Florida, with Mourning scoring 21 points and pulling down 11 rebounds. They met the West Region No. 3 seed, 20th-ranked Florida State, in the second round. The Seminoles largely denied Mourning the ball, and in the last game of his collegiate career he had only three rebounds and seven field goal attempts, making four of them. Meanwhile, Florida State junior point guard Sam Cassell scored 19 points and sophomore forward Doug Edwards had 15 points and 16 rebounds, and the Seminoles defeated the Hoyas 78–68 in one of the biggest wins in Florida State basketball history. It was the third straight season that Georgetown had been eliminated in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Hoyas were ranked No. 22 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 18 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nDuring the season, Mourning had averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocked shots per game, shooting 59.5% from the field and 75.9% from the free-throw line. He graduated in May 1992 as one of the greatest players in Georgetown men's basketball history. During his four-year career, he had averaged 16.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 3.8 blocked shots per game. Still, he had never led his team to a Final Four appearance, even with Dikembe Mutombo as his teammate the first three seasons. This was largely because an unusually high number of scholarship players – 11 of 23 – transferred from Georgetown between 1987–1988 and 1992–1993, preventing the team from building a core of veterans to play with its two dominating centers. Without that core of veterans, the Mourning-Mutombo teams were unable to replicate the success of the veteran-filled Patrick Ewing teams of the early 1980s, which had reached the Final Four – and indeed the national championship game – three times in four seasons.\nRoster.\nSource\nSenior guard Ronny Thompson was the son of head coach John Thompson, Jr.\nRankings.\nSource\n1991–92 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

A blackball flag is represented with a black circle in the center of a yellow or red flag; a yellow background being the most common. The flag is designed to protect swimmers from potentially harmful surfboards that may be moving at velocities after a \"wipe out\" from a wave. Swimmers maintain that the policy is a safety measure, while many surfers contend that blackball is an attempt to cull the in-water population in certain zones, providing preferential treatment to swimmers over surfers.\nNewport Beach, California has regular headlines regarding the use of blackball and dedicates a section of their official government site to the issue. US House Representative Dana Rohrabacher and Southern California politician Michael B. Glenn have both made campaign issues out of the blackball implementation. Rohrabacher noted that Newport Beach was the only city who practiced blackball and also did not have a dedicated area for surf use."

        "title": "George Campbell (American football)",
        "text": "George Campbell IV (born October 27, 1996) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He was rated as the tenth best player (and No. 1 rated athlete) by ESPN and as a top-10 wide receiver by Scout.com and Rivals.com in the national high school class of 2015. He completed his junior season at East Lake High School during the 2013–14 school year. He committed to Michigan prior to his high school junior season, but decommitted following the season and committed to Florida State Seminoles, where he used three years of eligibility before graduating. He has also accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game. In 2020, he signed as an undrafted free agent with the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL).\nHigh school.\nSon of Joyce Nix and George Campbell III, George, at the age of 5 and after his father's imprisonment, developed a close bond with his uncle Ahmad Jackson. Nix is a certified nurse.\nFreshman.\nBefore his freshman season, he nearly attended Clearwater Central Catholic High School, as well as IMG Academy, but decided to attend his zoned school, East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida. As a freshman, he played varsity football for East Lake, but mostly on defense. He had 1 reception for a 26-yard touchdown, 2 interceptions and 81 tackles, including 2 forced fumbles. That season East Lake compiled a 9–4 record before losing in the 2011 Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Class 8A region final in overtime to Plant High School on December 2, 2011. Plant had won state championships in 2006, 2008 and 2009. Plant went on to become state champion that year, marking four consecutive years it had reached a championship game. Campbell accumulated statistics in 12 of the 13 games (not the November 4 game at Palm Harbor University High School). He was named a MaxPreps 2011 U.S. Air Force Freshman All-American first team selection at linebacker, although his true position was safety. He was not selected to the \"Tampa Bay Times\" 2011 All-Suncoast Region Football team for Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties or even the \"Times\" 2011 All-Pinellas County football team.\nSophomore.\nIn 2012, East Lake improved to 11–2, but again lost in the FHSAA Class 8A region final, this time to Dr. Phillips High School on November 30 by a 31–21 margin. In the first game of the season, when starter Artavis Scott injured his ankle, Campbell stepped in at wide receiver. Later in the season, when the team struggled to get pressure on the quarterback, Campbell moved from safety to defensive end. As a sophomore, his tackle total declined to 56, but his 764 receiving yards earned him 27 major Division I scholarship offers. His offers included Arkansas, Auburn, Boston College, Clemson, Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Illinois, Louisville, Miami (FL), Mississippi, Mississippi State, North Carolina State, Notre Dame, Ohio State, South Florida, Tennessee, Texas A&amp;M, UCF, UCLA, Vanderbilt, West Virginia. East Lake junior offensive lineman Mason Cole committed to Michigan's class of 2014 on February 25, which was one day before Cole was invited to participate in the 2014 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. That year Campbell played basketball and ran track for East Lake before having surgery on his left wrist on April 19. The following summer, he ran a 4.36 second 40-yard dash. His 4.36 time was on artificial turf, while he was timed a 4.37 on grass on the same day. He was also measured at in his vertical leap. He was a second team All-Suncoast region and first team All-Pinellas County team selection.\nJunior.\nPrior to his junior season, he verbally committed to the University of Michigan where he would play for Michigan Wolverines football as a freshman for the 2015 team via Twitter. At the time, he still attended East Lake High School, where he was about to play his junior year for the 2013 football team. At the time of his July 27, 2013 verbal commitment, he was ranked as the number one athlete and number three player in the class of 2015 by ESPN. When Scout.com released its first list of 5-star rated football players on August 12, 2013, Campbell was included among the 20 players listed and the only wide receiver included. At the end of that summer prior to his junior year football season, he was one of two juniors selected to the 2013 \"USA Today\" preseason All-USA team. He accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg before the end of October 2013. The November 15 FHSAA Class 7A region quarterfinal that East Lake won 13–12 ended with an alleged punch by a Palmetto High School coach that left Campbell with a cut inside his mouth. Other players were involved in the altercation, which is being investigated by the FHSAA. On November 19, 2013, ESPN moved Campbell up to the number two overall position in the class of 2015. This moved him ahead of Kevin Toliver II, but he remained behind Jashon Cornell. In Campbell's third time in the FHSAA, East Lake finally got past the regional finals (defeating Port Charlotte High School), only to lose the following week on December 6, 2013, in the state semifinals in overtime to Dwyer High School 31–24, despite a 65-yard touchdown reception by Campbell. Following the season, Campbell decommitted from Michigan on December 13.\nSenior.\nHe subsequently named the 10 schools he was considering, while excluding Michigan on July 28, 2014. The 10 schools were LSU, Alabama, Florida, FSU, Georgia, Clemson, UCLA, Ole Miss, Auburn, and Maryland. On September 5, he selected Florida State.\nCollege.\nCampbell spent four years at Florida State. His best season was his junior season when he caught 6 passes for 122 yards. Upon graduation, he announced his graduate transfer to Penn State in February 2019. However, he ended up at West Virginia University in June after failing to secure admission into a graduate program at Penn State. 7 of his 19 receptions at West Virginia, where he averaged 24.7 yards per reception, were for touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft, Campbell signed with the New York Jets on May 6, 2020. He was waived on September 5, 2020.\nCampbell signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League on January 25, 2021. He was released on July 19, 2021.\nCampbell joined the St. Louis Battlehawks of the XFL in February 2023. He was not part of the roster after the 2024 UFL dispersal draft on January 15, 2024."

        "title": "2000–01 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2000–01 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2000–01 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by Craig Esherick and played most of their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC, although they played some home games early in the season at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. The Hoyas were members of the West Division of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 25–8, 10–6 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 2001 Big East men's basketball tournament, but they lost to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals. The first Georgetown men's basketball team to appear in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament since the 1996-97 season and the last one to do so until the 2005-06 season, they reached the West Region semifinals of the 2001 NCAA tournament before losing to Maryland.\nSeason recap.\nBeginning this season, the Big East organized its teams into divisions for the second time in its history; this time, the two divisions were the East and West divisions. Georgetown would play as a member of the West Division for three seasons before the conference again scrapped its divisional structure after the end of the 2002–03 season.\nFreshman forward Mike Sweetney joined the team this season and quickly established himself as a dominating power forward. He started all 33 games during the season and got off to a strong start, scoring 19 points in each of his first three games. In Big East play, he had 14 points and 14 rebounds in a big upset win over 18th-ranked Seton Hall in early January 2001, had another double-double ten days later against Nevada-Las Vegas, scored 14 points and pulled down 13 rebounds against Syracuse, and scored a season-high 24 points against Pittsburgh. During the season, he led the Hoyas in scoring 11 times and in rebounding 13 times, and he finished the season averaging 12.8 points and 7.4 rebounds per game.\nSweetney's arrival meant that junior guard and team co-captain Kevin Braswell took fewer shots than he had in his first two seasons, but his shooting average from the field improved from 33.5 percent in his freshman year and 36.8 percent in his sophomore year to 37.8 percent this season and his play was more even, with fewer of the deep slumps he had suffered through previously. He started all 33 games; he started all 128 games of his collegiate career. In the early-January upset of Seton Hall, he scored a career-high 26 points, and he scored in double figures in nine games over a ten-game stretch late in the season.\nSenior center and team co-captain Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje started all 33 games, but no longer was a primary scoring option as Georgetown's frontcourt offensive focus shifted to Sweetney and center-forward Lee Scruggs. Nonetheless, he scored in double figures 12 times, and over a four-game stretch late in the season scored a combined 55 points and pulled down a combined 37 rebounds as the Hoyas pushed for an invitation to the NCAA tournament.\nSophomore guard Demetrius Hunter replaced senior guard Anthony Perry in the starting lineup this season, but Perry remained active in a \"sixth man\" role and appeared in all 33 games. Although he averaged only 17 minutes and six field goal attempts per game, he scored 16 points twice, at Houston on New Year's Eve and again three days later at West Virginia, and had a 15-point game at Rutgers in which he stole the ball at the end of the game to preserve a Georgetown victory. He finished the season averaging 6.7 points per game for the year and 9.5 points per game for his career.\nSenior guard Nat Burton had dropped into a reserve role the previous season, reducing his offensive statistics, and his offensive production dropped further this season. However, he played a key role in some important games. He scored 11 points in a win at Louisville, had eight rebounds at Houston, and scored 16 points against Virginia Tech. His playing time diminished as the year wore on, and he scored only a combined 30 points in the final 13 games of the regular season. Freshman forward Gerald Riley joined the team, and started all 33 games – as he would all 125 games of his collegiate career – and showed promise as the team's fifth scoring option, playing small forward and averaging 6.7 points per game. He would emerge as a star in later seasons.\nThe team opened the season 16–0, the best start by a Georgetown team since the 1984–85 season, with four of the wins against Big East opponents. After that, the Hoyas lost six of their next ten games, all in the conference, often thanks to poor starts. They fell to 20–6 overall and 7–6 in the Big East, and with only three games left in the regular season and 17th-ranked Syracuse coming to the MCI Center on February 24, 2001, the Hoyas' hopes of making the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament were in doubt. Against Syracuse, Georgetown scored the first seven points of the game, but the Orangemen responded with a 9–3 run to close to 10–9. Despite suffering from an Achilles tendon injury, Demetrius Hunter scored a three-pointer to open Georgetown's lead to 13–9. After Syracuse took a 15–14 lead, Scruggs hit a three-pointer to give the Hoyas a 17–15 advantage, and the teams traded leads for the rest of the first half, with Georgetown leading 36–33 at halftime. The Hoyas shot poorly from the free-throw line during the first half, and, in the second half, while Syracuse was scoring on 90 percent of its free throws, the Hoyas shot only 3-for-9 (33%) from the free-throw line in one stretch and only 12-for-28 (42.9%) for the game. Syracuse was leading when Hunter scored back-to-back three-pointers to put the Hoyas ahead with 11:10 left in the game. With Syracuse in foul trouble inside, Georgetown's lead varied between six and eight points. Syracuse senior forward Damone Brown's field goal with 5:04 left cut Georgetown's lead to 63–57, but it was the Orangemen's last field goal of the game. Playing tough defense, grabbing three straight offensive rebounds, and using the clock well, the Hoyas built their lead to 12 points with 2:39 remaining. Hunter, who had a 21-point game, scored on a slam dunk with 38 seconds remaining, after which Braswell dribbled out the clock to seal a 72–61 Hoya win. After the game, Hoya fans flooded onto the court, the first time that had ever happened at a Big East home game for Georgetown.\nGeorgetown won its final two regular-season games to give it a record of 23–6 overall, 10–6 in the Big East, and a second-place finish in the conference's West Division. The Hoyas received a bye in the first round of the 2001 Big East tournament and in the quarterfinals met Seton Hall, a team they had beaten twice during the regular season. Braswell shot 0-for-6 from the field and failed to score – the only game in his collegiate career in which he did not score – and the underdog Pirates handed Georgetown a 58–40 loss.\nDespite their early exit from the Big East tournament, the Hoyas had a 23–7 record overall and received an invitation to the 2001 NCAA tournament. Making their first appearance in the tournament since 1997, they were seeded No. 10 in the West Region and met the No. 7 seed, Arkansas, in the first round. Pregame press coverage billed the game as a struggle between Arkansas's press defense and Georgetown's height inside, but the Razorbacks' press was not especially effective and the Hoyas' frontcourt of Boumtje-Boumtje, Sweetney, and sophomore forward Wesley Wilson shot a combined 0-for-4 from the field in the first half amidst bad passing and bad shot selection. Guards Braswell and Perry – with Perry hitting two big three-point shots during the game – kept the Hoyas close as the teams traded leads, but Arkansas took a 31–30 advantage into the locker room at halftime. Toward the end of the intermission, arena personnel were forced to dismantle a malfunctioning horn and light above one of the baskets, delaying the start of the second half for ten minutes; after the second half finally began, Georgetown's inside game improved, but Arkansas also began to score inside consistently, and the Razorbacks led 47–43 with about 10 minutes left to play. They soon extended their lead to 52–45, but Georgetown then went on a 12–5 run to tie the game at 57–57 with just over five minutes remaining. Arkansas retook the lead and held it until Braswell took the ball all the way from one end of the court to the other and scored to give the Hoyas a 61–59 lead with 1:43 remaining. Arkansas sophomore Joe Johnson scored to tie the game at 61–61 with 35.8 seconds left to play. After a time-out, Georgetown sophomore forward Victor Samnick passed the ball to Burton, who held the ball, intending to get it to Braswell for a last-second game-winning shot. Unable to get the ball to Braswell, Burton instead drove to the basket himself and rolled in a shot at the buzzer. With the horn and light dismantled, it was not immediately obvious that Burton's shot had been in time, and Arkansas officials complained that the shot had been too late. A two-minute review by game officials ensued, and after they ruled that Burton's shot indeed had beaten the buzzer, Georgetown had a 63–61 upset victory. It was Georgetown's first NCAA Tournament win since 1996 and its first NCAA Tournament win at the buzzer since 1988. It was only the third time in 22 NCAA Tournament appearances that Georgetown had defeated a higher-seeded opponent.\nIn the second round, Georgetown faced the region's No. 15 seed, Hampton. Braswell scored 17 points despite shooting only 6-for-14 (42.9%) from the field, and the Hoyas defeated the Pirates, 76–57. Boumtje-Boumtje had a combined 15 points and 18 rebounds against Arkansas and Hampton.\nIn the West Region semifinals, Georgetown met the region's No. 3 seed, 11th-ranked Maryland. The Hoyas played well in the first half, leading by as many as five points on more than one occasion and forcing Maryland to commit nine turnovers. Georgetown only scored off two of those turnovers, however, and late in the half was stymied by a Maryland zone defense. After a frustrated Sweetney was called for an intentional foul, allowing the Terrapins to score four points and causing a six-point turnaround in the game, the Hoyas lost the lead. Demetrius Hunter missed a dunk and Maryland began to collect a number of offensive rebounds, off one of which they scored at the buzzer to take a 38–36 halftime lead. Early in the second half, Maryland extended its lead to nine points, with center Lonnie Baxter scoring six of them on his way to a 26-point, 14-rebound performance for the Terrapins. Boumtje-Boumtje played tentatively and fouled out after playing only 19 minutes, with three rebounds, one blocked shot, and no points scored. Although Braswell shot only 3-for-22 (13.6%) from the field, he and Scruggs led the Hoyas to a comeback that allowed them to close to 59–56 with under five minutes to play and a 67–62 deficit with 3:17 remaining. After that, however, Maryland extended its lead with good free-throw shooting. The Hoyas were forced to attempt three-pointers to try to catch up, but shot only 1-for-6 (16.7%) from three-point range late in the game and the Terrapins prevailed 76–66. Sweetney averaged 10 rebounds a game during the NCAA Tournament, while Boumtje-Boumtje completed his Georgetown career as the school's fourth all-time shot blocker, behind only Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, and Dikembe Mutombo.\nThe 2000-01 team's 25–8 finish was the best season for an Esherick-coached team and it was the only time during Esherick's -year tenure that Georgetown appeared in the NCAA Tournament. Although during the next four years Georgetown would appear in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) twice and turn down an NIT invitation on a third occasion, the Hoyas would not return to the NCAA Tournament until 2006.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n2000–01 Schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

The competition was the fourth time a World Artistic Gymnastics Championships has been held in the continent of Asia.\nCompetition schedule.\nAll times are CST (UTC+8).\nVenues.\nMain Arena.\nThe main arena where the competition was held was the Guangxi Gymnasium, which opened in 2012.\nTraining Gymnasium.\nThe training facility for the competition was held at the Li Ning Sports Park. As per any International Gymnastics Federation competition format, there was a podium training session where the gymnast trains on the podium in the arena to get a feel for the competition equipment on a raised surface.\nMascots.\nIn April 2013, the mascots Nannan (male) and Ningning (female) were unveiled as the official mascots of the event.\nMen's results.\nIndividual all-around.\nIn the men's all-around final, only two gymnasts per country can compete. Ryohei Kato and Shogo Nonomura of Japan, Lin Chaopan of China, Max Whitlock and Daniel Keatings of Great Britain, and Nikita Ignatyev of Russia were among those who had earned scores in the qualification round high enough to qualify for the individual all-around final, but could not compete due to the two-per-country rule. On October 8, Nile Wilson withdrew from the all-around final due to a wrist injury, and his teammate, Max Whitlock, competed in his place. On that day, it was also announced that Alexander Shatilov of Israel had pulled out of the competition and would be replaced by reserve athlete Ferhat Arıcan of Turkey.\nKōhei Uchimura of Japan once again made history by winning his fifth consecutive World all-around title.\nFloor.\n2011 World champion and 2013 bronze medalist on floor Kohei Uchimura qualified in 5th, but did not progress to the final because his Japanese teammates Kenzo Shirai and Ryohei Kato qualified ahead of him.\nPommel Horse.\nAfter failing to make the finals in Antwerp in 2013, 2011 World and 2012 Olympic champion Krisztián Berki reclaimed his title on his specialty.\nRings.\nReigning Olympic and defending World champion Arthur Zanetti was edged out by newcomer Liu Yang by 0.200.\nVault.\nReigning Olympic and 2-time World champion Yang Hak-Seon failed to defend his title or even make the podium because he fell on both of his vaults. The 2007 World bronze medalist Ri Se-Gwang grabbed his first world title. Only Yang Hak-Seon and Ri Se-Gwang attempted two top 6.4 difficulty vaults with the former failing at both the Yang Hak Seon on vault and Tsukahara 3½, and latter succeeding in the Ri Se Gwang and Ri Se Gwang 2 on vault. Yang was trying to successfully complete the Tsukahara 3½ to become his second eponymous skill on men's vault, but since he fell on landing, his attempt was only credited for its difficulty score and not his name. Yang was the top qualifier, despite using two 6.0-difficulty vaults in qualifying before increasing them to two 6.4s in the final. Gwang used own 6.4s in all rounds. Shirai's lower difficulty of 5.6 of his second vault, which was also the only vault performed in the finals with a difficulty less than 6.0, was a contributor significant enough to miss him a spot on the podium here as he only trailed American Jacob Dalton in an average combined score by just 0.137, a deduction on landing equivalent to a small step.\nParallel bars.\nReigning World champion Lin Chaopan of China failed to qualify for the final, placing 17th in qualifications. Former World champion Kōhei Uchimura failed to qualify due to the two-per-country rule, with his teammates Ryohei Kato and Yusuke Tanaka qualifying ahead of him.\nHorizontal bar.\nReigning Olympic and defending World champion Epke Zonderland successfully took home the gold on horizontal bar. 2013 World silver medalist Fabian Hambüchen failed to qualify. He finished in 22nd place with a score of 14.366.\nWomen's results.\nIndividual all-around.\nOnly two athletes per country are allowed to compete in this event. The following athletes scored enough to qualify for the individual all-around final but did not compete due to the two-per-country rule: Mykayla Skinner of the United States (6th), Madison Kocian of the United States (14th), and Ekaterina Kramarenko of Russia (15th).\nSimone Biles successfully defended her title. Larisa Iordache gave Romania its first medal of the 2014 Worlds with a silver. 2013 World all-around silver medalist Kyla Ross took the bronze. Russia's Aliya Mustafina placed fourth, not making the podium for only the second time in her senior career after falling on floor.\nVault.\nReigning 2011 and 2013 World champion McKayla Maroney missed the competition to recover from a knee injury. She was the only 2013 World champion not to compete in Nanning. 2008 Olympic champion and 2013 World bronze medalist Hong Un-jong claimed her first world title on vault, the first North Korean World champion since Kim Gwang-Suk in 1991. Simone Biles claimed silver again as she did in 2013, and Mykayla Skinner grabbed her first individual medal, a bronze.\nUneven bars.\nDue to the two-per-country rule, Tan Jiaxin of China and Ekaterina Kramarenko of Russia were not able to compete in the final due to other members of their national team qualifying ahead of them. 2013 World champion Huang Huidan settled for the silver by 0.067 to her compatriot Yao Jinnan, who claimed her first World championship gold medal. 2014 European bronze medalist Daria Spiridonova grabbed another bronze at her first World Championships, edging out Ashton Locklear by 0.017.\nBalance beam.\nDue to the two-per-country rule, Shang Chunsong and Huang Huidan of China were not able to compete in the final as they qualified behind teammates Yao Jinnan and Bai Yawen. 2013 World champion Aliya Mustafina of Russia had a hiccup in her routine and did not complete a required acrobatic series, and despite a 0.5 deduction, claimed the bronze over Asuka Teramoto of Japan by 0.066. 2013 World bronze medalist Simone Biles claimed her third gold medal of the competition on beam, 0.067 over silver medalist Bai Yawen of China. \nFloor.\nSimone Biles successfully defended her title from 2013, her fourth gold medal in Nanning and ninth overall. 2013 World bronze medalist Larisa Iordache grabbed the silver, and 2012 Olympic Floor bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina edged out Mykayla Skinner by 0.033 to claim the bronze, her 11th medal overall."

        "title": "1946–47 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1946–47 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1946–47 NCAA college basketball season. Elmer Ripley returned to coach it in the first season of his third stint as head coach, his eighth overall season as the Hoyas head coach. The team was an independent and for the first time played its home games at Uline Arena in Washington, D.C., although because of conflicts at Uline Arena it played four home games on the campus of The Catholic University of America at Brookland Gymnasium, which had been its home court the previous season.\nRipley previously had coached Georgetown from 1927 to 1929, leaving to coach Yale for six seasons, and again from 1938 to 1943, leading the Hoyas to what at the time was their only postseason tournament appearance in the 1943 NCAA Tournament. He then left to coach at Columbia and Notre Dame when Georgetown suspended its basketball program for two seasons during World War II. This time he would coach the Hoyas for three seasons, and the 1946–47 team was by far the most successful of his third stint as Georgetowns coach.\nSeason recap.\nWith neither Ripley nor the varsity players of 1942–43 available the previous season, Georgetown had fielded a virtually all-walk-on team in 1945–46 with its only veteran player, Ken Engles, serving as player-coach. None of those players returned for 1946–47 except for junior guard George Benigni; instead, the returning Ripley brought back those members of the nucleus of the 1942–43 team who still had eligibility – senior guards Lloyd Potolicchio and \"Miggs\" Reilly, junior guard Dan Kraus, and junior forward Andy Kostecka, who all came back from World War II military service to play this season. He also brought with him from Notre Dame sophomore guard Tommy O'Keefe and sophomore forward Ray Corley, both of whom transferred to Georgetown to continue to play for him. Given the success of the 1942–43 Georgetown and 1945–46 Notre Dame teams – the former had gone 22-5 and the latter 17-4 – the outlook for 1946–47 was promising.\nKostecka was the teams top scorer all season, as well as in almost two-thirds of the individual games during the year; he set a school record by scoring 35 points against Niagara on January 25, 1947, and he scored 28 against Catholic, 22 against Nevada, and 20 against Penn State. When Duquesne came to Washington on March 4, 1947, to play Georgetown with a 19-game winning streak – one of which had been a victory over the Hoyas four days earlier – Kostecka scored 16 points in a 57-39 Georgetown victory that ended the Dukes streak. Kostecka broke his arm in a game at Villanova two days later, ending his season, but he finished with 17.8 points per game, the highest average for a Georgetown player in 29 years. Meanwhile, Dan Kraus, although a defensive specialist, finished the year scoring 12 points a game.\nBeginning the season with a 5-1 start, the Hoyas lost three of their next five games to fall to 7-4. They went 12-3 after that, finishing the season by winning eight of their last nine, to post a final record of 19-7. They barely missed invitations to the NCAA Tournament and National Invitation Tournament and had no postseason play.\nDespite falling just short of a post-season tournament appearance, the 1946–47 team was one of the best in Georgetown history. No other Georgetown team would win 19 games in a season again until the 1975-76 team won 21, and no Georgetown team would exceed its 9-2 road record until the 1983-84 national championship team posted an 11-1 road record during its regular season.\nRoster.\nSources\nFrom the 1943–44 season through this season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) suspended its freshman ineligibility rule. Georgetown had no basketball program during the 1943–44 and 1944-45 seasons, having suspended all competitive athletic programs in 1943 for the duration of World War II, so this was the last Georgetown team to play during this early period of freshman eligibility. After the conclusion of this season, the NCAA reinstated the rule that freshmen were ineligible to play on varsity teams, and they would remain ineligible until the 1972-73 season.\nSophomore guard Tommy O'Keefe would later serve as Georgetowns assistant coach for four seasons from 1956 to 1960 and as head coach for six seasons from 1960 to 1966.\nSenior guard Lloyd Potolicchio, who had served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, resumed his military career after graduation, serving in the United States Air Force and seeing duty during the Korean War. He was killed on January 17, 1966, when the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker he was aboard collided with a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress it was refueling over the Mediterranean Sea off Palomares, Spain, and crashed. The B-52, carrying four hydrogen bombs, also crashed, resulting in the Palomares Incident.\n1946–47 schedule and results.\nSources\nThe March 13, 1947, game against Boston College was a post-season fundraiser which counted in the term's official final record.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "1998–99 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1998–99 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1998–99 NCAA Division I college basketball season. They were coached by John Thompson, in his 27th season as head coach until January 8, 1999, when he resigned and Craig Esherick succeeded him. The Hoyas played most of their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC, although they played one home game at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season 15–16, 6–12 in Big East play. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the 1999 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Miami. Not invited to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the second year in a row, they instead appeared in the 1999 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) – their second consecutive appearance in the NIT – and lost to Princeton in the first round. Georgetown finished with its first losing record since the 1972–73 season.\nSeason recap.\nPlaying the previous season with a roster depleted by transfers, injuries, and point guard Victor Pages early departure for a professional career, Georgetown in 1997–98 had had its least successful season since 1973–74. The Hoyas began to rebuild their roster this year.\nGuard Anthony Perry sat out his freshman year because the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had ruled that a computer science class he had taken in high school was insufficient as a core requirement, rendering him academically ineligible for 1997–98. He finally joined the team this season as a sophomore and started all 31 of the teams games, scoring in double figures in 22 of the first 24 games of the year, including 26 points in a game against Syracuse and 24 against Connecticut. He suffered an ankle injury that reduced his performance as the season wore on, and he shot only 20-for-83 (24.1%) from the field to finish the year. Despite his late-season shooting woes, he finished his sophomore year as Georgetowns top scorer for the season, averaging 14.0 points per game.\nFreshman guard Kevin Braswell was another newcomer to the team. He started all 31 games – in fact, he would start all 128 games of his collegiate career – and immediately emerged as a prodigious shooter, averaging one shot every 25 seconds and 17.6 points per game during the first five games of the year. During the season as a whole, he scored in double figures 23 times, including four games in which he scored 20 or more points and a season-high 29 points against Georgia State, and he averaged 13.5 points per game for the year. Despite his overall scoring prowess, he played inconsistently; his 441 field goal attempts were second only to Allen Iverson among Georgetown freshman, but he shot only 33 percent from the field in contrast to Iversons 39 percent. In one of his more notable slumps, he shot only 24.5 percent from the field in three straight losses over a one-week period at the end of 1998 and beginning of 1999, going 7-for-18 (38.9%) against Miami on December 30, 4-for-18 (22.2%) at top-ranked Connecticut on January 2, and 2-for-17 (11.8%) at Seton Hall on January 4.\nAs a freshman the previous season, guard Nat Burton had been thrust into a starting role as Georgetowns roster ran low on players. Now a sophomore, Burton played in 30 of the teams 31 games and started 28 of them. Although he only shot around 25 percent from beyond the three-point line, he was an aggressive rebounder and inside shooter, and he scored in double figures 12 times in the teams final 14 games. He finished third in scoring on the team, averaging 11.4 points and 4.9 rebounds per game.\nAfter suffering a wrist injury and missing all but the first six games of the previous season, sophomore center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje returned to action but got off to a slow start, scoring only six field goals in his first four games of the season. He started all 31 games and improved as the season wore on, with five double-doubles, among them a 15-point, 13-rebound performance in a win over Pittsburgh. He finished second in rebounding and fourth in scoring for the team, averaging 8.5 points per game for the year. He blocked 89 shots, the third in history among Georgetown sophomores behind only Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning.\nAfter coaching a last game for Georgetown at Seton Hall on January 4, 1999, head coach John Thompson, Jr., abruptly resigned and retired on January 8, 1999, after 26½ seasons at the helm, citing his impending divorce and other family issues and rejecting the idea posed by friends of leaving the team only temporarily for a sabbatical. Assistant coach Craig Esherick, a reserve guard for Georgetown from 1974 to 1978 who had returned as an assistant coach in 1982 and served in that capacity for 17½ seasons, took over, beginning his own five-and-a-half-season run as head coach. Eshericks first game as head coach was against Providence on January 9, 1999.\nTwenty-two days after Thompsons resignation, Georgetown made one of the most remarkable comebacks in school history, albeit in a losing cause. On January 30, 1999, the Hoyas faced Villanova at First Union Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and missed their first ten shots to fall behind the Wildcats 13–0. The Hoyas closed to a 39–30 deficit at halftime, but in the second half Villanova opened with a 16–8 run that left Georgetown trailing 55–38 with 13:55 left to play. With Nat Burton scoring 11 of his game-high 21 points, Georgetown then went on a 19–0 run of its own that gave the Hoyas a 57–55 lead. Eleven ties and fourteen lead changes ensued as three of Georgetowns \"big men\" fouled out. The game went into overtime, and then into a second overtime. With 14 seconds left in the second overtime and Georgetown leading 90–87, Anthony Perry missed a free throw, and Villanovas Howard Brown scored a 22-foot (6.7-meter) three-point shot to tie the game at 90–90 with 2.6 seconds left. Burton tried to call a time-out, but the officials did not see him, and when Georgetown senior guard-forward Daymond Jackson tried to pass the ball to Perry, Villanovas Brooks Sales intercepted the pass and flipped the ball to Jermaine Medley, who scored a winning 28-foot (8.5-meter) three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Wildcats a 93–90 win.\nThe team opened the season 6–2 but struggled in conference play, posting a 14–14 record overall, 6–12 in the Big East. Its 10th-place finish in the conference earned it a No. 10 seed in the 1999 Big East tournament. In the first round, the Hoyas upset seventh-seeded Providence, but they fell to second-seeded Miami in the quarterfinals.\nWith a 15–15 record after the tournament, Georgetown missed the NCAA tournament for the second year in a row, the first time the school had missed the tournament for two consecutive seasons since the 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons. For the second straight year, the Hoyas accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). They lost at Princeton in the first round, bringing their season to the end. The 15–16 record they posted was Georgetowns first losing season since 1972–73.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in the AP Poll at any time.

In the round of 16, the four third-placed teams played against four of the group winners from group A-D, with the remaining two group winners from group E and F taking on two of the group runners-up; the remaining four runners-up were paired off against each other. The winners of the eight round of 16 matches were then paired together in the quarter-finals, the winners of which played against each other in the semi-finals.\nThe ties in each round were played over a single match; in the event that scores were level after 90 minutes, the teams would play an additional 30 minutes of extra time, divided into two 15-minute halves, to determine the winner. If the scores remained level after extra time, the teams would contest a penalty shootout.\nA third place match was also held on the day before the final, between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the six groups, plus the four best-placed third teams, qualified for the knockout stage.\nBased on group results, the matches would be the following in Round of 16:\nThe pairings for matches 1, 4, 5 and 8 depend on who the best third places are that qualify for the round of 16. The following table published in Section 28 of the tournament regulations, shows the different options to define the rivals of the winners of groups A, B, C and D.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nAs both were European teams, this was already set pre-match as the second consecutive World Cup in which European teams finished third."

The company is currently owned by Indian businessman Dilip Jajodia, who acquired it in 1987.\nHistory.\nThe Duke family began hand-manufacturing cricket balls as a cottage industry at Redleaf Hill, Penshurst, Kent, England in 1760 and continuing until 1841. Having gained the Royal patent for the cricket balls in 1775, Duke made the first-ever six-seam cricket ball, which was presented to the then Prince of Wales and used in the 1780 English cricket season. In 1851, Dukes triple-sewn ball won a prize medal at the Great Exhibition and a gold medal at the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880.\nIn 1920, Dukes merged with John Wisden and company a manufacturer of cricket bats. In 1999, the company introduced the white ball for that year's Cricket World Cup. The company was acquired by Indian businessman Dilip Jajodia in 1987.\nProducts.\nThe red cricket balls manufactured by the company are used for playing Test cricket in United Kingdom, the West Indies and Ireland. The ball consists of a hand-stitched seam with six rows of threads. The ball retains its shape and characteristics longer compared to the other balls in use and hence provides a good swing. The leather is polished with a synthetic grease with a traditional English Alumtine finish which gives a darker shade to the ball."

        "title": "Rugby union and apartheid",
        "text": "Rugby union and apartheid had a complex and supportive relationship. From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of rugby within South Africa drew frequent controversy. South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.\nHalt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981. South Africa were excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed Māori to go under the status of 'honorary whites'.\nNo other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with rugby league over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.\nThe issue affected not only black South Africans, but also indigenous New Zealanders and to a lesser extent indigenous Australians. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as would be frowned upon.\nThe famous Scottish rugby commentator, Bill McLaren, devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, \"Talking of Rugby\", called \"Barred from the International Feast\". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's \"\"unacceptable racist policy\", but adds \"it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.\"\"\nIan Robertson, documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outside the rugby fraternity:\nApartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981.\nGoverning bodies.\nLike most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:\nThere was also the South African Rugby Union (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership. However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.\nAt the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.\nBritish Lions.\nThe British Lions were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.\nIn the years 1948–1980, the Lions made five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in the apartheid period was in 1955, seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in 1962, 1968, 1974 and one final one in 1980. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions did not go back there until their 1997 tour when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.\nThe Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to, but in December 1985 the South African Rugby Board announced they would not be inviting the Lions to tour the following year. Political objections to South Africa's apartheid policies including a potential boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for an International Rugby Board centenary match was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by Clive Rowlands and coached by Mick Doyle. The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.\nMāori and apartheid.\nNew Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against Māori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by Pākehā (white New Zealanders).\nIn 1973 a proposed Springbok (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although Pākehā continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the patu squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.\nDuring and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned Pākehā protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of Pākehā protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly Pākehā prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi.\n1950s.\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\nIn April 2010 it was revealed by Muru Walters that in 1956 Ernest Corbett, Minister of Māori Affairs, had told the Māori All Blacks to deliberately lose to the Springboks \"for the future of rugby\". The Māori team lost 37–0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated Māori rugby players.\n1960s.\nForeign complaints about South Africa's segregated sports brought more isolation. In 1960, Verwoerd barred a Māori rugby player from touring South Africa with New Zealand, and the tour was cancelled. New Zealand made a decision not to send an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.\nIn 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, having been forced out at the 1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. In 1963, Lloyd McDermott, the first Australian aborigine on the team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to rugby league as a result.\nB. J. Vorster took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting competition, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.\n1970s.\nIn March 1973, the Argentine government and the Union Argentina de Rugby had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to San Isidro Club to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to South Africa by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.\nSouth Africa was the indirect cause of the 1976 Olympic boycott. A New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa prompted African countries to demand that the New Zealand Olympic team be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that rugby union was not an Olympic sport and the New Zealand Rugby Union was not affiliated to the New Zealand Olympic Committee. Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.\nIn February 1977, Danie Craven flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the British Lions tour of South Africa in 1980.\nFor the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.\nHowever, some, such as Chris Laidlaw, later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:\nTimes have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf – a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.\nBut there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. Bill McLaren thought apartheid was \"unacceptable\", but:\n1980s.\nThough contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991.\nIn 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the Falklands War.\nThe supposedly turned down its invitation to the 1987 Rugby World Cup, because of its distaste for the \"apartheid\" regime of South Africa. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa. Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited. In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:\nNo nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose \"apartheid\" in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.\nThe Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:\nOver the years, Ferasse has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the v. match in Toulouse in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7\nIn September 1981, was due to play the Mid-West in Chicago. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to Racine and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46–12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.\nIn 1989 a World XV, sanctioned by the IRB and funded by South African Breweries, played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20–19 at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town and the second test 22–16 on 2 September at Ellis Park in Johannesburg .\nSouth Africa in New Zealand, 1981.\nThe 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.\nTwo games had to be cancelled. The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the halfway line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.\nThe final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the \"Crazy Biggles Test\". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets. All-Black prop Gary Knight was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.\nMusician Bruce Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour. He was at the University of Otago at the time.\nIt was a tight game, with Allan Hewson, the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25–22. As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:\nThere will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.\nThe role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\nThe NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. Two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.\nNew Zealand Cavaliers.\nA \"rebel tour\" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid. This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.\nThe All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the apartheid régime (1990–1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers but often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.\nOf the 30 players who had been selected for the All Black tour, only David Kirk and John Kirwan did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments—a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport \nOn their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the \"Baby Blacks\". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.\nSouth American Jaguars.\nThe Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Spain.\nWhile many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognised by Union Argentina de Rugby, a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones, due to the politics of those countries. This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the \"Pumas\" to play a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa.\nPost-apartheid era.\n1995 Rugby World Cup.\nAfter his election in 1994, Nelson Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup.\nPrior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions Australia, who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.\nDuring the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France. They then met New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final at Ellis Park Stadium. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a drop goal from Joel Stransky.\nDuring the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the Webb Ellis Cup while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.\nThis was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as F.W. de Klerk later put it, \"Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\" Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, Winnie, accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.\nThese events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, \"Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation\", that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-apartheid South Africa. Carlin sold the film rights to Morgan Freeman. The result was the 2009 film \"Invictus\", directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar."

After a few years adjusting to the level of National League competition, the Men's team started to find success in the 2005/2006 season, when they won the National Shield for the first time, and also claimed second place in the league, earning them promotion to Division Two. 2006/2007 saw them defend their National Shield title, while the following two years brought successive runner-up places in the end-of-season playoffs. It would take until the 2011/2012 season for the Men's team to finally reach Division One, earning promotion with a double success in winning the league title and end-of-season playoffs.\nCoincidentally, the Women's team won their first promotion in the 2005/2006 season as well, claiming the triple of the Division Two title, play-off crown and National Shield, launching the team into the Women's top flight after only a few short years.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was criticised in removing departmental sides, with players voicing their concern to revive the teams. However, in August 2023, the PCB announced the return of departmental cricket with the start of 2023–24 President's Trophy, therefore resuming the participation of the team."

        "title": "1942–43 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1942–43 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1942–43 NCAA college basketball season. Elmer Ripley coached it in his seventh of ten seasons as head coach; it was also the fifth and final season of his second of three stints at the helm. The team returned to Tech Gymnasium – where Georgetown had played its home games from 1929 to 1940 – on the campus of McKinley Technical High School in Washington, D.C., for its home games. It finished with a record of and became the first Georgetown team in history to participate in a post-season tournament, advancing to the final game of the NCAA tournament, losing to Wyoming. Its youth and inexperience led it to be nicknamed the \"Kiddie Korps.\"\nSeason recap.\nThe previous season, Georgetown had posted a 9–11 record, after which all but three varsity players had either graduated or left school for military service in World War II. For 1942-43, Ripley fielded a young team consisting of three seniors, a junior, and ten sophomores (at a time when freshmen were ineligible for varsity play under National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules), leading to the team being nicknamed the \"Kiddie Korps.\" However, the sophomores were a particularly talented group Ripley had recruited primarily from the New York City area, and had led the 1941-42 freshman team to a 20-1 record.\nOne of the talented sophomores to join the varsity from the freshman team this season was forward Andy Kostecka. In the seasons second game, the 1942–43 squad became the first Georgetown team to score 100 or more points in a game when it defeated American 105-39 – a margin of victory no Georgetown team would exceed until the 1986–87 team beat Saint Leo 126-51 – and Kostecka scored a season-high 22 points in the game. He also had strong scoring performances against Temple, Catholic, Syracuse, and Penn State, and by the middle of the season led the team in scoring and was averaging 15 points per game. At the end of February 1943, Kostecka left school for World War II military service, not to return until the 1946–47 season, but he nonetheless was the teams second-highest scorer for the year.\nSenior center Bill Bornheimer, who had starred for Georgetown the previous two seasons, would have played his senior year with the team this year, but the university had instituted an accelerated graduation schedule because of World War II, causing Bornheimer to graduate in January 1943 and lose eligibility for the 1942–43 season. Fortunately for the Hoyas, sophomore center John Mahnken joined the varsity from the freshman team, so impressing fellow sophomore center Sylvester \"Stretch\" Goedde with his talent that Goedde gave up hope of competing with Mahnken for playing time and left the team after three games to return to his native Ohio to pursue a minor-league baseball career. Mahnken scored 25 points against Syracuse and averaged 16 points per game in the later part of the season and 15.4 points per game overall.\nOne of the more notable games of the regular season came in January 1943 against the Quantico Marines, a United States Marine Corps team composed of former college players that was favored to beat the Hoyas. The Marines led through most of the game, but Georgetown mounted a comeback to close to 52-48 with two minutes left to play, at which point Ripley put talented sophomore point guard Dan Kraus into the game. Mahnken used a head fake to open up a shot for himself and then scored to make the score 52-50. The Marines did not score on their next possession, and sophomore Georgetown guard Jim \"Miggs\" Reily made a set shot to tie the game at 52-52. Kraus then stole the ball from Quantico on the Marines final possession; with time running out, Ripley shouted \"Shoot!\", and Kraus scored on a 15-foot (4.6-meter) shot as time expired to give the Hoyas a 54-52 upset win. According to legend, the Marines were so angry over Krauss steal and game-winning last-second basket that the Georgetown team required an armed escort after the game for protection.\nOn February 11, 1943, the Hoyas defeated longtime rival Fordham 52–39, their only victory over the Rams in 16 meetings between 1925 and 1952. The win completed a three-game homestand sweep that also included victories over Syracuse and Penn State, giving the Hoyas a 14–2 record and putting them in the running for their first NCAA tournament bid.\nThe team finished the regular season with a record of 19-4, and the NCAA selection committee chose Georgetown over Kentucky and Duke for one of the four Eastern bids in the 1943 NCAA tournament, while the National Invitation Tournament invited the Hoyas to play in the 1943 NIT — the first invitations to a post-season tournament in Georgetown men's basketball history. The Hoyas turned down the more regionally oriented NIT — at the time considered more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament — in order to play in the NCAA Tournament, which included teams from a larger geographic area and would give Hoya basketball true national exposure.\nIn the tournament quarterfinals at Madison Square Garden, Georgetown faced New York University, which had defeated the Hoyas 16 times in their last 21 meetings dating back to the 1921–1922 season and was the 2-to-1 favorite of New York City sportswriters, but Georgetown won in an upset, 55-36, with Mahnken scoring 18 points for the Hoyas. In the semifinals, the Hoyas were 3-to-1 underdogs to DePaul under first-year head coach Ray Meyer and led by their dominating center George Mikan. Following Ripleys strategy for the game, Kraus and Georgetown sophomore guard Billy Hassett kept Mikan busy in the middle while Hoya center Mahnken scored with outside shooting. The plan did succeed in allowing Georgetown to score, but also left Mikan fairly free to score for DePaul at the other end; despite this, Georgetown closed to 28-23 when Hoya guard Lloyd Potolicchio scored on a 50-foot (15-meter) shot at the buzzer at the end of the first half. The Hoyas pulled ahead in the second half, but Mahnken fouled out with 10 minutes left. Ripley put Henry Hyde, seven inches shorter than Mikan, in to play center. Hyde managed to keep Mikan in check, and Georgetown upset DePaul 53-49, prompting a Hoya fan to shout \"Believe it or not...by Ripley!\", a quote which received wide publicity. Hassett, a very reliable passer and outside shooter for the Hoyas, had 11 points in the game.\nGeorgetown faced Wyoming, led by center Milo Komenich and forward Ken Sailors, in the final, which had a smaller crowd than expected because of the New York Citys area's focus on the NIT championship run by St. John's; it was also the only NCAA championship game in history which was not filmed for posterity. Although Wyomings defense held Mahnken to six points in the game, Georgetown led 31–26 with six minutes to play – but Wyoming then scored 11 straight points to take a 37–31 lead. The Hoyas closed to 37–34, but Wyoming finished the game with nine unanswered points to win 46–34 and take the championship. The following evening, as a fundraiser for the American Red Cross, the finalists of the NCAA Tournament and NIT took part in the Sportswriters Invitational Playoff, in which the two tournament champions, Wyoming and St. Johns, and the two runners-up, Georgetown and Toledo, played each other. The NCAA Tournament teams prevailed in both: Wyoming beat St. John's 52-47, and the Hoyas defeated Toledo 54-40 to close out the season. The Hoyas finished with a record of 22–5, the most wins in team history and the first time a Georgetown team won 20 or more games. No Georgetown team won as many games for 35 years, until the 1977–1978 team won 23.\nThe performance of the \"Kiddie Korps\" raised hopes for an extended period of college basketball success for Georgetown. Later in 1943, however, the school suspended all of its athletic programs for the duration of World War II. With no basketball team to coach, Ripley left Georgetown to coach at Columbia, and the collegiate careers of many of Georgetowns players came to an end. Mahnken served in the military, then pursued a professional basketball career instead of returning to Georgetown. Hassett transferred to Notre Dame and completed his college basketball career there.\nGeorgetown would have no basketball program during the 1943–44 and 1944-45 seasons. After World War II ended in August 1945, the school would resume athletic competition and put together a varsity mens basketball team for the 1945–46 season. After two years at Columbia, Ripley had committed to coach Notre Dame in 1945-46, and those Georgetown players from the 1942–43 team retaining eligibility to play – notably Kostecka, Kraus, Potolicchio, and Reilly – had not yet returned from military service. Georgetown would field a virtually all-walk-on team in 1945-46, and Ripley and his eligible players from 1942-43 would not return to Georgetown until the 1946–47 season.\nThe Hoyas would not appear in a postseason tournament again until the 1952–1953 team played in the NIT in 1953, and they would not take part in the NCAA tournament again until the 1974–1975 team played in the 1975 tournament. The 1942-1943 team was the only Georgetown mens team to win a game in a post-season tournament until the 1977–1978 teams fourth-place finish in the 1978 NIT, and the only one to win a game in the NCAA Tournament until the 1979–1980 team reached the East Region final of the 1980 NCAA tournament. Georgetown would not appear in the Final Four or the NCAA Tournament championship game again until the 1981–1982 team finished as the national runner-up in 1982.\nRoster.\nSources\nAfter World War II military service, sophomore guards Dan Kraus, Lloyd Potolicchio, and \"Miggs\" Reilly and sophomore forward Andy Kostecka all returned to play on the 1946-47 team.

It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Sportswriters Invitational Playoff"

They compete in Pakistan's first-class List A and Twenty20 tournaments.\n1980s.\nState Bank of Pakistan made their first-class debut (along with Pakistan Automobiles Corporation) in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1983–84, but lost all their nine matches. In a bizarre match against Muslim Commercial Bank they were dismissed for 73 and 57. \"Wisden\" explained: \"Owing to injuries State Bank batted six short in each innings.\" Apart from that match, their last one of the season, they were dismissed for between 114 and 255 in every innings. In the first match Tariq Javed scored 124 in the second innings. It was the team's only century in the 1980s.\nThey next played in the BCCP President's Cup in 1986–87, losing all three of their matches with totals of 186, 54, 79, 229, 111 and 106.\n2010 onwards.\nState Bank of Pakistan returned to first-class status in 2010–11 with a stronger team, finishing second in Division Two of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy with 4 wins, 1 loss and 4 draws from 9 matches. They were promoted to Division One for the 2011–12 season, where they finished fourth, with 5 wins, 3 losses and 3 draws. In the President's Trophy in 2012-13 they finished ninth out of eleven teams, with 2 wins, 4 losses and 3 draws, and in 2013-14 they finished tenth, with 2 wins, 5 losses and 3 draws.\nIn May 2019, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan revamped the domestic cricket structure in Pakistan, excluding departmental teams like State Bank in favour of regional sides, therefore ending the participation of the team. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was criticised in removing departmental sides, with players voicing their concern to revive the teams. However, in August 2023, the PCB announced the return of departmental cricket with the start of 2023–24 President's Trophy, therefore resuming the participation of the team."

        "text": "Ricky Evans (born 29 July 1990) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events.\nCareer.\nFrom 2007 to 2012 Evans attempted to qualify for each BDO World Championship but was unsuccessful.\nIn 2011, Evans won a PDC Youth Tour event by beating David Coyne 4–1 in the final. He has played in the World Masters five times with his best finish coming in 2012 where he lost in the last 48 to James Wilson.\nIn 2013, Evans played in the Qualifying School to earn a tour card for the Professional Darts Corporation events and succeeded on the first day. Less than two months later he reached the quarter-finals of a PDC Pro Tour event for the first time by beating Gary Anderson 6–5 in the last 16 of the second UK Open Qualifier, before he lost 6–3 to Peter Wright. This saw him enter the UK Open in the second round stage where he was defeated 5–2 by Joe Cullen. Evans won through to the final of the World Under-21 World Championship which was played on the finals night of the Premier League Darts at the O2 Arena in London, with Evans losing 6–1 to Michael Smith. However, the result was enough to see him reach the Grand Slam of Darts for the first time, but he lost each of his Group E games to Raymond van Barneveld, Mervyn King and Tony O'Shea to finish bottom of the table.\nEvans advanced to his first final in main PDC events at the 13th Players Championship of the year. He beat established players such as Gary Anderson, Ronnie Baxter, Jamie Caven and Ian White, before losing 6–3 against Brendan Dolan. Evans' successful debut season continued later in the month as he was a losing semi-finalist at the final Players Championship. He amassed £11,550 in ProTour events during the year which saw him qualify through the Order of Merit for his first PDC World Championship where he outplayed the experienced Baxter in the first round to win 3–0 in sets. Evans next faced 14th seed Mervyn King but ultimately fell to the veteran 4–2 in sets. After the match King praised Evans' performance and described him as \"the future of our sport\". Evans was ranked world number 56 after his debut season on the PDC tour.\nHe could not get beyond the last 128 in any of the six qualifiers for the 2014 UK Open, which resulted in his failure to qualify for the event. Evans' form improved as the year progressed by qualifying for the final two European Tour events. At the European Darts Grand Prix he beat Jelle Klaasen 6–3, but lost 6–5 against Vincent van der Voort in the second round and at the European Darts Trophy he was eliminated in the first round 6–5 by Klaasen. In November, Evans reached the last 16 for the only time this year at the 20th and final Players Championship where he lost 6–3 to Ian White.\nAt the second UK Open Qualifier of 2015, Evans progressed through to his first quarter-final in over a year where he lost 6–3 to Vincent van der Voort. He reached the third round of the UK Open for the first time by beating Mark Layton 5–3, but then lost 9–4 to James Wilson. A second quarter-final appearance this year came at the fifth Players Championship where, after defeating Colin Osborne, Andy Smith, Jamie Robinson and Devon Petersen, he lost 6–2 to Keegan Brown.\nEvans won the qualifier for the 2016 World Championship with a 5–4 victory over Andy Boulton. He played 2010 runner-up Simon Whitlock in the first round and, having trailed 2–0 in sets and 2–0 in legs (surviving two match darts), Evans mounted a comeback to eventually win the match 3–2 with a 130 checkout. However, Evans lost 10 legs in a row in his second round match against Jamie Caven to be knocked out 4–0. A 9–5 victory over Andy Boulton saw Evans play in the fourth round of the UK Open for the first time, but he missed match darts against Darren Webster to lose 9–8 after leading 4–1 early on. A quarter-final appearance came at the seventh Players Championship event (lost 6–2 to Gerwyn Price) and he went one better at the 16th event to reach his first semi-final in nearly three years. He also missed double 12 for a nine darter during the day, before losing 6–4 to Steve West in the last four. These results have seen Evans qualify for the Players Championship Finals and he faced James Wade in the first round.\nEvans' first round match with Michael Smith at the 2017 World Championship went to a deciding set in which he failed to win a leg to be beaten 3–2. He reached the semi-finals of the first UK Open Qualifier, but lost 6–4 to Adrian Lewis.\nAt the 2018 Dutch Darts Championship, Evans made his first PDC European Tour final, where he lost 8–5 to Ian White.\nIn 2019, he followed that up with another runner-up spot at Players Championship 6 before reaching his second European Tour final at the 2019 German Darts Championship, where he lost 8–6 to Daryl Gurney.\nPlaying style.\nEvans is known for his incredible dart throwing speed, and has been described by Sky pundit Wayne Mardle as the quickest player he's ever seen. Evans will usually throw three darts within three to five seconds of approaching the oche unless changing position or going for a double, a trait which has led to his nickname of 'Rapid'.\nDuring the 2017 World Championship, Evans hit a 180 in just 2.16 seconds during his first round match against Michael Smith.\nPerformance timeline.\nPDC European Tour"

        "text": "Neal Shapiro (born July 22, 1945) is an American equestrian and was a silver medalist in team jumping and Bronze medalist in individual jumping in the 1972 Munich Olympics, where he became the first American Equestrian jumper to win two medals and only the third U.S. rider to win an individual medal in an Olympic show jumping event. In 1967, he began driving and training harness horses in trotting and pacing competitions, a career he continued after retiring from competitive show jumping in 1976. He purchased a stable, Hayfever Farm in 1976, and in addition to acting as a trainer, he began a career as a standardbred harness horse owner. In 2007, he moved his stables, Hayfever Farm, to Robbinsville, New Jersey. He continued to train equestrians and horses, and after ending his training career, returned to riding show horses on a limited basis in 1998. He was jumping coach for the US Equestrian Team at the Maccabiah Games in 2013.\nCareer.\nShapiro was born in Brooklyn, New York, and is Jewish.\nEarly career.\nHe took up riding by five and started riding horses in shows around 1956, when he was eleven. Shapiro was largely self-taught in his early years, riding at his family’s small farm in Old Brookeville, N.Y., on Long Island. In an interview, Neal noted, “I started competing seriously in 1959 on the Long Island Circuit on a little mare named Buttons.” “At 15, I showed Music Man in Madison Square Garden in 1960.” His career took a giant step for the better when he changed his mount.\nUncle Max, Horse of the Year, and Nations Cups Team.\nAt fifteen in 1961, Shapiro became the youngest rider to win the American Horse Show Association (AHSA) Horse of the Year title in the green jumper division aboard his horse Uncle Max. In 1963, Shapiro and Uncle Max were reserve Professional Horse Association (PHA) champions. Uncle Max was a tall gray ex-rodeo gelding that his father had purchased for him with the hope he would make a good jumper. In 1964, on Uncle Max and Jacks or Better, Shapiro took the PHA’s top two places, for the first time in the history of the PHA. Shapiro did not make the US Equestrian Team as a regular in 1964 as he was almost exclusively a show jumper as was his mount, but he borrowed a horse for the dressage, cavaletti and gymnastics, and did well enough in the Grand Prix jumping to impress the American Equestrian Team coach Bert deNemethy. deNemethy, a Hall of Fame jumper himself, invited Neal to join the Nations Cups team as one of the young riders. In the fall of 1964, Shapiro rode on the Nations Cups team at the National in New York and the Pennsylvania National Horse Show.\nUS Equestrian team.\nAround the age of 21, in late 1964 and into 1965, at a teen center in Gladstone, New Jersey, trainer-coach of the U.S. equestrian team, Bert de Nemethy began supervising Shapiro's progress as a rider. Around 18, Shapiro transferred to Rutgers University. In 1966 Shapiro won in the Grand Prix of Aachen, West Germany against 80 of the World's top riders. Shapiro won in 1966 on his mount Jacks or Better and won again in 1971 on Sloopy. Shapiro lacked a mount for the 1968 Olympics, but began riding Sloopy by 1970.\nShapiro remained a member of the American Equestrian team for nearly 12 years, roughly from 1965–76, with all of his training taking place at the US Equestrian Team facility in Gladstone NJ, where he remained under the supervision of Bert deNemethy, Master Horseman. In 1976, Shapiro retired from competitive show jumping.\nWinning competitions.\nShapiro's Equestrian wins included England's Last Chance Cup and Horse and Hound Cup, the President’s Cup in Washington, the Grand Prix of Harrisburg, the National Horse Show, The Royal Winter Fair and LaBaule, France. Shapiro was the Leading International Rider at the National Horse Show and in 1972 the AHSA named him “Horseman of the Year.”\n1972 Olympic medalist.\nHe won a silver in the team jumping competition and a bronze medal in show jumping at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Shapiro was inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 2010. Shapiro's mount Sloopy was treated for a bad virus in July 1972, and then a week before the games while riding in Munich, he landed badly on a jump receiving a cut on his hind leg that required 30 stitches. Shapiro believed the injury may have reduced Sloopy's endurance for the final jumps and caused the gelding to lose points after he nicked the tape, and knocked down two rails on a late jump, but Neal was pleased with the Bronze medal and impressed with Sloopy's stamina. Reflecting on the challenges of Olympic competition, Neal remembered, “These were tough, enormous courses. There’s a lot of pressure. You’re competing against the elite, the best in the world.\" In addition to his Olympic medals, Shapiro was a contributor to twelve winning Nations Cup efforts for the US Team.\nAfter Olympic competition Shapiro and his wife, Suzy, lived on Long Island, where he was a horse owner, and trainer, and continued to drive, and train harness horses.\nHarness racing driver-trainer.\nIn 1970, Shapiro got his harness racing trainer's license. He needed a year of apprenticeship to compete as a harness racer, but it took him longer as he was travelling often with the United States Equestrian Team in the early 70's. In 1972, in addition to competing in Equestrian show jumping, he drove and trained harness horses, including some owned by his father, and worked as a harness racing driver-trainer. He began competing in harness racing around 1967 and by 1972 had competed at Roosevelt and Yonkers, Monticello and Liberty Bell, and won a few races. Harness racing came with injuries as did jumping and Shapiro broke both legs twice, and both collarbones in his career.\nOn September 15, 1974, as a show horseman, he attended and participated in the Nassau Grand Prix at the North Shore Equestrian Center at C. W. Post College, Brookville, New York and acted as an honorary co-chair.\nHe continued with harness racing, attending Bavaria Downs in 1980, though he had taken a break from the sport. Shapiro claimed to have given up Equestrian jumping in 1976 at the age of 38 in order to earn a living in another field, and harness racing was an important sideline during that period.\nSuccess training harness horses.\nAround 1977, Shapiro set up shop and built a facility at a Saratoga Springs, in East central New York, at a farm which they named Hay Fever Farm of Clifton Park. Working there as a trainer for 20 years, he trained Bon Vivant, a trotter, to more than $400,000 in earnings and the pacer Bomb Rickles to winnings of more than $500,000. Bomb Rickles was also driven at times by Shapiro who drove the Standardbred trotter to one of his biggest wins in the $200,000 \"Windy City Pace\" at Maywood Park in Chicago on Friday, May 22, 1988, with a time of 1:56:2 taking $100,000 as the owner's share of the stakes. By 1988, Bomb Rickles had earned in excess of $250,000. Bomb Rickles had previously been victorious in a $6000 race at nearby Saratoga Raceway's Open Pace on May 2, 1988. Shapiro's greatest successes were with trotting mares and fillies, though he did well with pacers.\nSuccess driving harness horses.\nIn February 1984 in Pompano Beach, Florida, Shapiro drove two harness horses to wins in the same week at Pompano Park, Plymouth Lobell and Duran Lobell. By 1984, he had won 263 times in his harness racing career, collecting around $1 million in purses. In that year, he had 23 horses at his Hayfever Farms Stable, but only his horse Sunbright was considered a major figure in harness racing. Shapiro believed that in time he could train some of his less recognized horses into becoming winners. His current stable is located in Robbinsville, New Jersey which he opened with his wife Elisa Fernandez in 2007. Elisa was a three-time Olympic Equestrian for Mexico, including Tokyo, Mexico City and Munich.\nOn Sunday, September 11, 1988, his horse Spectre Almahurst, a three year old pacing filie, figured as a competitor in the Lady Catskill Pace at Pennsylvania's Monticello Track in Monticello, Pennsylvania. In 1996, he entered Midnight Mattness in the tenth race, for the $150,000 John W. Miller Memorial Final, at Pocono Downs.\nHe returned to the world of show jumpers in 1998, though taking a limited role as a rider in competition. He ended his role as a harness horse trainer that year, giving him thirty years as a successful driver and trainer of harness horses.\nOn February 7, 2000, Shapiro was scheduled to attend a Wildwood Charitable Foundation's event sponsored by the Wildwood Equestrian Center at the Carousel Dinner Theatre at Akron, Ohio. Some of the community benefits went to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\nMarriage.\nAfter having known her for forty years, he reconnected with Elisa Fernandez in 2002, formerly known as Elisa Pérez de las Heras. At her third Olympic Games in 1972 in Munich she had competed in equestrian jumping for Mexico. Neal had competed for the US and medaled at the same games. They married in 2002 and began Hayfever Farm in 2007 where they trained and taught students and horses to compete in hunting, jumping, and equitation. They also teach children and non-competition riders and board horses.\nMaccabiah games US team coach.\nHe coached show jumping for the 11-person U.S. equestrian team at the 19th Maccabiah Games (the \"Jewish Olympics\") in Israel in 2013.\nIn his spare time, Shapiro is a pilot and an organist. He began training as a pilot in his youth and considered a career as a pilot before he was selected for the US Equestrian Team. He is also skilled at shoeing horses. He is the cousin of historian Edward S. Shapiro."

        "title": "1995–96 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1995–96 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1995–96 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 24th season as head coach. They played their home games at USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East 7 Division of the Big East Conference, were the regular-season champions of the Big East 7 Division, and finished the season with a record of 29–8, 13–5 in Big East play. Their record earned them a bye in the first round of the 1996 Big East men's basketball tournament, and they advanced to the tournament final before losing to Connecticut. They were awarded a No. 2 seed in the East Regional of the 1996 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – Georgetowns 17th NCAA Tournament appearance in 18 years – and advanced to the East Regional Final before losing to No. 1 seed Massachusetts. They were ranked No. 4 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 7 in the postseason Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nThis was the Big Easts first season in which it organized its teams into divisions; the two divisions were the Big East 6 and Big East 7 divisions. Georgetown would play as a member of the Big East 7 Division for three seasons before the conference scrapped its divisional structure after the end of the 1997-98 season. For its first year in the Big East 7 Division, Georgetown fielded a powerhouse team that included four future National Basketball Association (NBA) stars and began the season ranked fifth in the country.\nSophomore guard Allen Iverson led the team with a dominant season. The previous year, he had averaged 20.4 points per game despite shooting only 39 percent from the field, 23 percent from three-point range, and 19 percent in three-point shots during Big East play; this year he shot 48 percent from the field and 36.6 percent in three-pointers, with impressive results. In the second game of the year against Temple in the Preseason NIT, he shot 50 percent from the field, scored 24 points, and had a career-high 10 rebounds. In the tournaments third game four days later, he scored 23 points against 25th-ranked Georgia Tech, and two days after that he completed the tournament with a career-high 40-point game against 19th-ranked Arizona. In an early Big East game against Rutgers, he scored 21 points despite playing only 20 minutes. In the last 25 games of the season, Iverson led the team in scoring 21 times, including another 40-point game against Seton Hall, 39 against St. John's, 34 against Providence, and 30 against 23rd-ranked Memphis.\nSenior center and team co-captain Othella Harrington had had a standout freshman year, but his production had declined over the previous two seasons as Georgetown began to emphasize uptempo guard play rather than feeding the ball to the \"big man\" at center, and his junior year had been his least successful. He recovered this season, with a shooting percentage from the field (55%) and free-throw line and an offensive rebound total (100) which all were more like those of his freshman year. He scored 25 points and had 12 rebounds against Duquesne, scored 23 at USAir Arena against 17th-ranked Syracuse – a team against which he averaged 17 points per game and three times scored 20 or more points during his four-year career – and had a 27-point, 10-rebound game against Memphis.\nFreshman point guard Victor Page joined the Hoyas this season. One of the nations top prospects, he played in all 37 games and started 33. In the first three games of the season, he scored a combined 71 points, including 25 in the Georgia Tech game. He averaged 12.5 points per game for the season. Senior forward and team co-captain Jerome Williams had another good year, averaging 10 points and 8.8 rebounds a game, shooting 58.8% from the field, and finishing second to Iverson in steals. He completed his two-year varsity career averaging 54.4 percent from the field. Sophomore center Jahidi White saw only limited action, but began to show his potential, including a 19-point, 11-rebound effort in only 17 minutes of play against Morgan State in December 1995.\nTwo days after beating Memphis, the Hoyas faced third-ranked Connecticut at USAir Arena. The Huskies came into the game with a chance to break the record for consecutive wins in Big East games set by the 1984-85 Hoyas. Before a national television audience and a sold-out arena, the Georgetown defense held Connecticut junior shooting guard Ray Allen to two points in the first half and forced the Huskies to commit 20 turnovers. Hoya sophomore forward Boubacar Aw scored 11 points and grabbed five rebounds, while Iverson scored 26 points, highlighted by a soaring dunk early in the second half that electrified the crowd, and had eight steals and six assists as the Hoyas upset Connecticut 77–65. Connecticut became the highest-ranked team that Georgetown had defeated since the 1987-88 Hoyas defeated second-ranked Pittsburgh in January 1988.\nThe Hoyas closed out the regular season with a 106–68 win at USAir Arena over sixth-ranked Villanova, the sixth-largest margin of victory in Georgetown history and the schools largest margin of victory ever against a Top Ten opponent. Iverson played only 27 minutes but scored 37 points, grabbed eight rebounds, and had three steals.\nGeorgetown finished the regular season as the first-ever Big East 7 Division champion, earning the Hoyas a No.2 seed in the 1996 Big East men's basketball tournament and a bye in its first round. The Hoyas beat Miami in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they faced ninth-ranked Villanova. The Wildcats got Iverson into foul trouble and held Harrington, Williams, and Aw to a combined 1-for-8 (12.5%) shooting from the field. Page responded by putting the Hoyas into a slowdown offense, focusing on quick scoring attempts as the shot clock ran down, grabbing nine rebounds, and shooting 12-for-19 (63.2%) from the field to score a career-high 34 points. Georgetown won 84–76 to advance to the tournament final the next evening.\nThe final was another meeting with third-ranked Connecticut. Georgetown was ahead 74–63 with 4:46 left in the game when the Hoyas again began to play a delay game, trying to get the ball inside to Iverson for scoring opportunities just before the shot clock expired. Iverson, however, shot only 4-for-15 (26.7%) from the field for the evening, and Georgetown did not score again for the rest of the game. Connecticut closed the gap. With the Hoyas leading 74-73 and thirteen seconds remaining, Ray Allen barely beat the shot clock with an off-balance shot that scored to give the Huskies a 75–74 lead. Georgetown failed in two attempts to score in the final seconds, and Connecticut took its third Big East tournament championship. It was the fourth time the Hoyas had lost in the tournaments final game since 1991. Page, however, became only the second player to receive tournament Most Valuable Player honors without playing for the championship team.\nThe loss prevented Georgetown from receiving a No. 1 seed in the 1996 NCAA tournament, but the Hoyas were seeded No. 2 in the tournaments East Region. The Hoyas defeated Mississippi Valley State in the first round and New Mexico in the second round, and Harrington scored 23 points as Georgetown beat eighth-ranked Texas Tech in the East Region semifinal. The Hoyas thus advanced to an NCAA regional final (the \"Elite Eight\") for the first time since 1989 to face the regions No. 1 seed, top-ranked Massachusetts. Although Harrington scored 13 points, Iverson shot only 6-for-21 (28.6%) from the field against the Minutemen, and Massachusetts won 86–62 to knock Georgetown out of the tournament.\nDespite his poor tournament performances against Connecticut and Massachusetts, Iverson finished the year having scored 926 points, breaking the previous single-season record by 124 points, and also setting single-season records for field goals (312), field goal attempts (650), three-point shots (87), three-point attempts (238), steals (124), minutes played (1,214), and scoring average (25.0 points per game), and he ranked seventh in the United States in average points scored per game for the season. Citing a need to earn money for his family with which to pay one of his sisters medical bills, Iverson opted after the season to forgo his remaining two years of college eligibility and leave school to enter the NBA draft, the first Georgetown player to do so since John Thompson became head coach in 1972. The move was controversial, as Georgetown fans had come to expect the teams great players to fulfill a full four-year commitment to play for the school. His departure presaged a decline in Georgetowns basketball fortunes over the next decade.\nThe team finished the year ranked fourth in the Associated Press Poll and seventh in the Coaches' Poll.\nRoster.\nJunior reserve guard Brendan Gaughan later became a successful NASCAR driver.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1995–96 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

This was Bermuda's seventh appearance at a Winter Olympic Games, and cross-country skier Tucker Murphy's second consecutive Games as the only athlete. In the 15 kilometre race, he finished in 84th place.\nBackground.\nBermuda first appeared in Olympic competition at the 1936 Berlin Summer Games, and debuted in the Winter Olympic Games at the 1992 Albertville Games. They have appeared in every Olympics since their respective debuts bar one; they were one of 54 nations who boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The only medal the territory has won so far is a bronze in the sport of boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The Bermudian delegation consisted of one cross-country skier, Tucker Murphy. This was Murphy's second consecutive Olympics as Bermuda's only representative. Despite the terrorist threats on the Sochi Olympics, there were no plans to withdraw unless Murphy felt unsafe, and the delegation ultimately competed as scheduled. The delegation marched in the opening ceremony with their traditional Bermuda shorts. Murphy was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, while a ceremony volunteer carried the flag for the closing ceremony.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe final quota allocations were released on January 20, 2014, and Bermuda had one athlete eligible for qualification. Tucker Murphy qualified for the Olympics by meeting the \"B\" standard time at an event in Chamonix, France in January 2014. He was 32 years old at the time of the Sochi Olympics. Murphy finished his only race, the 15 kilometre freestyle, in 84th position with a time of 49 minutes and 19 seconds, improving on his 88th-place finish four years prior. Four years later, Murphy would again represent Bermuda at the 2018 Winter Olympics."

He was named to that position prior to the 2011 season.\nBorn in Claremore, Oklahoma, Chambers graduated from Pleasant Grove High School in Pleasant Grove, Utah. He played at three colleges and earned all-conference honors at all three. These included Dixie State, where he was an All-American in 1984. In 1985, Chambers transferred to Utah Technical College, then to Southern Utah, where he earned his degree in 1989. He began his coaching career in 1991 at Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, where he remained until 1999. In his time with the Gaels, the team won six consecutive Sunset Division championships, and were the state runners up in 1997. Chambers was named NIAA Coach of the Year in 1992 and 1993. He also coached the Las Vegas Knights of American Legion Baseball, where he won three state championships and reached the 1998 American Legion World Series.\nIn 2000, Chambers was hired to coach the Southern Nevada Coyotes baseball team, an NJCAA squad in Las Vegas. As the first Coyotes coach to manage a game (first coach Roger Fairless resigned prior to the program's first competition due to health issues), Chambers built the program to a major power, including seven conference championships, the regional titles, two district championships and the 2003 NJCAA World Series title. In 2010, Chambers coached the Bryce Harper-led Coyotes to the NJCAA Semifinals.\nIn the summer of 2010, the Washington Nationals, who would later draft Harper first overall, courted Chambers to be a scout. Instead, a month later Chambers was introduced as the head coach at UNLV, following Buddy Gouldsmith's resignation. In his three seasons, the Rebels have reached 30 wins twice and claimed wins over several ranked teams, including Stanford, TCU, UC Irvine, and Arizona, while entering the rankings in both 2011 and 2013 themselves. Chambers was fired by UNLV in December 2015 after being arrested for driving under the influence.\nChambers died on October 27, 2019."

        "title": "2014 Li Na tennis season",
        "text": "The 2014 Li Na tennis season officially began on 30 December with the start of the 2014 WTA Tour as the defending champion of the 2014 Shenzhen Open. In July, Li ended her nearly 2 year collaboration with coach Carlos Rodríguez. Li announced her retirement from professional tennis on 19 September citing recurring and worsening knee injuries. Li also made the longest winning streak in 2014 WTA Tour with 13.\nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nShenzhen Open.\nLi Na started her season as the defending champion at the 2014 Shenzhen Open. She defeated former world number two and wildcard Vera Zvonareva and Nadiia Kichenok in the first two rounds, before being challenged by Monica Niculescu in the quarterfinals, winning in three tight sets. She then defeated rising German Annika Beck in the semifinals to reach the final for the second consecutive year, where she defeated compatriot Peng Shuai in straight sets, marking the first successful title defense of her career.\nAustralian Open.\nInstead of more preparation in Sydney, Li chose to compete at the Australian Open directly this year, at which she had been a finalist twice in the last three years. Intent on going one better, Li routed current junior top 2 players Ana Konjuh and Belinda Bencic in the first two rounds. After quickly losing an error strewn first set against Lucie Šafářová, she fended off a match point when trailing 5–6 in the second before rebounding in the tiebreak and decisive set to avoid the upset. She finished the match with 17 winners to 50 unforced errors. In her fourth round encounter with Ekaterina Makarova, Li delivered the third bagel in the tournament, easing through with a straight set victory. Li followed this up with another dominant performance against first-time Australian Open quarterfinalist Flavia Pennetta to set up a clash with teenager Eugenie Bouchard in the last four. Li easily won the first set having won 20 of the first 23 points to lead 5–0. Down 0–2 in the second set, she reeled off six of the next eight games to close out the Canadian. She reached the final for the third time, where she faced maiden Grand Slam finalist Dominika Cibulková. After winning the first set in a tiebreak, Li stormed through the second set at love to claim her second Grand Slam title, thus becoming the first Asian Australian Open champion and sixth woman to win the title after being match point down.\nHer post-match speech became one of the most talked-about moments in the event. Because of her limited English, she jokingly remarked that her agent should \"make [her] rich\" and her husband is \"lucky\" to find her before thanking the crowd and everyone involved.\nMiddle East series.\nQatar Open.\nSince Li missed out on last year edition's of the Qatar Open due to injury, she had no points to defend. She won her second round match against Magdaléna Rybáriková before being upset by qualifier and world No. 134 Petra Cetkovská in three sets, her first loss of the season. However, she reached a new career-high of world No. 2 after the tournament as a result of defending champion and current world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka's withdrawal.\nNorth American hard court season.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nAfter missing Indian Wells in 2013, Li was the first seed this year in the absence of Serena Williams, the first time she was seeded first at a Premier Mandatory event. She enjoyed a first round bye before dispatching compatriot Zheng Jie, Karolína Plíšková and Aleksandra Wozniak in convincing fashion. In the quarterfinals she faced her first top 20 opponent of the season in Dominika Cibulková, a rematch of the Australian Open final. After Li took the opening set comfortably, Cibulková quickly built a 5–1 lead in the second due a plethora of unforced errors off Li's racquet. Li managed to recover three games but was unable to salvage the set. After the pair traded breaks early in the third, Cibulková held double break point with Li serving at 3-all. From there Li won 12 of the next 16 points to clinch the final three games and the victory after 2 hours and 36 minutes of play, maintaining her perfect record against the Slovak. With this win, Li advanced to her first Indian Wells semifinal since 2007. Facing 20th seed Flavia Pennetta in the semifinal, she was defeated in straight sets.\nMiami Masters.\nLi received a bye in the first round of Miami Masters. In the second round she was bound to face Alisa Kleybanova, however the Russian withdrew shortly prior to the match due to a viral illness. In her third round encounter with Madison Keys, she erased two set points in the first set before forcing a tiebreak, which she won. In the second set she won five consecutive games from 0–2 down and eventually took the match handily. She then had an easy win against the 15th seed Carla Suárez Navarro, setting up a quarterfinal with Caroline Wozniacki. After Li burst out to a 4–1 lead in the first set, Wozniacki won four games in a row to go up 5–4, before Li fired back with three games of her own to take the set. The Dane was up 5–3 in the second set before Li reeled off four consecutive games to advance. In the semifinal, she met Dominika Cibulková for the third time this year. Li blew two set points when serving for the first set on her first attempt at 5–3, but successfully closed it out on her second. From 2–all in the second set, Li lost 6 games in a row to lose the set and fall behind 0–2 in the decider, before upping her game to seize six of the last seven games to seal the win, securing a place in her maiden Premier Mandatory final, where she was defeated by world No. 1 Serena Williams in straight sets despite having a set point in the first set.\nClay court season.\nStuttgart Open.\nLi withdrew from this year edition of Stuttgart Open before the tournament.\nMadrid Open.\nLi started her clay season at the Madrid Open, where she lost to Madison Keys in the first round last year. She defeated Kirsten Flipkens and countrywoman Zheng Jie in the first two rounds without much trouble. In the third round match against Sloane Stephens, Li surrendered the first set but regained form to earn a place in the quarter-final. She was defeated by eventual champion Maria Sharapova in three sets, after winning the first set comfortably.\nItalian Open.\nAt the Italian Open where she was sent home by former world No.1 Jelena Janković last year, Li received a bye for first round and defeated Australian Casey Dellacqua in the second. She then defeated Sam Stosur for the first time after 6 encounters in her career. In the quarterfinals against Sara Errani, Li suffered her first loss to the home favourite.\nFrench Open.\nThe former champion suffered her earliest loss at the event to Kristina Mladenovic. She was the first Grand Slam champion to lose in the opening round of the following Grand Slam since Petra Kvitová did so at the 2011 US Open.\nGrass court season.\nWimbledon.\nThe only grass court event Li participated in this year was the Wimbledon Championships. She easily defeated Paula Kania and Yvonne Meusburger in the first two rounds. She then bowed out to Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in two tiebreak sets.\nUS Open Series.\nLi withdrew from the 2014 Rogers Cup, 2014 Western &amp; Southern Open and 2014 US Open this year due to a knee injury, at all of which she was a defending semifinalist. She surrendered her world No. 2 ranking to Simona Halep following the Rogers Cup.\nAfter skipping the entire US Open Series due to a left knee injury, Li officially announced her retirement from the sport on 19 September 2014, also withdrawing from the tournaments in Wuhan (her hometown) and Beijing. She was ranked no.6 by the Women's Tennis Association at the time of her retirement.\nTournament Schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nLi's 2014 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nBold indicates that the player was in the Top 10, \"italics\" denotes that the player was in the Top 20 (at the time of the match being played). This list is ordered by number of wins to number of losses in chronological order played."

        "title": "East and West Kent cricket teams",
        "text": "East Kent and West Kent were titles sometimes given to two cricket teams from their respective areas of the English county of Kent which generally played in matches prior to the foundation of the official Kent County Cricket Club in the mid 19th century. West Kent (or West of Kent) teams have been recorded from 1705, but there is no known record of an East Kent team until 1781. There were seven major matches from 1781 to 1790 in which teams of this type faced each other, although there is doubt about the match titles with sources using different team names.\nThe first Kent Cricket Club was founded in Canterbury on 6 August 1842, formed out of the Beverley Cricket Club, and played its first match against All-England three weeks later. In 1859 a second county club was formed at Maidstone to support the Canterbury club, the two often being known as the East Kent and West Kent clubs respectively. The two clubs amalgamated in 1870 to form the modern day Kent County Cricket Club.\nTeams called East Kent and West Kent played each other twice in 1856 in minor matches. Those two matches are the last known to involve an East Kent team. West Kent became the name of a 19th-century club which played minor cricket only and was for a long time based at Chislehurst Cricket Club, with which it ultimately amalgamated in 1980 as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club.\nMatches.\nThe earliest known record of a \"West Kent\" or \"West of Kent\" team is in a match against Chatham Cricket Club on 7 August 1705, played at a place called \"Maulden\" in the primary source. There is no such place although it is generally believed to refer to Town Malling near Maidstone. The result and details of the teams are unknown. The next mention is a match on 22 September 1769, played at Sevenoaks Vine between West Kent and a Surrey team. The original report merely states that the wickets will be \"pitched soon after 10\".\nThe earliest known match involving an \"East Kent\" team is one played against West Kent at Sevenoaks Vine on 20 and 21 June 1781. The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three given men on each side, the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens. Dorset's West Kent XI won both matches, the first by 10 wickets and the return by 106 runs.\nPart of the confusion around match titles comes from the ways in which Arthur Haygarth records matches. He calls the June match \"West Kent with Mann, Sueter &amp; Lumpy versus East Kent with Small, Veck &amp; Lamborn\", but then calls the August match \"Sir Horace Mann's Side versus the Duke of Dorset's Side\". In its \"Important Cricket Matches\" guide, the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians follows Haygarth by using the abbreviated titles \"East Kent with 3 gm v West Kent with 3 gm\" for the June match and \"Duke of Dorset v Sir H. Mann\" for the August match (\"gm\" meaning \"given men\").\nOn 25 and 26 June 1783, a match at Sevenoaks Vine involved \"West Kent with Harris, Stevens and Bedster versus East Kent\". East Kent won this by 2 wickets. A curious condition of the match was that Lumpy Stevens, generally reckoned the outstanding bowler of the time, \"was not to bowl, by agreement\". This would have severely handicapped his team, which lost the match, as he was not a good batsman and so, as Haygarth says, \"not much use as a given man\". Stephen Amherst, who was a Maidstone man and the patron of later West Kent teams, played in this match for the East.\nAmherst had become a match organiser by the start of the 1789 season and led his team to a five-wicket victory against that of Mann at Coxheath on 22 and 23 May. A contemporary report in the \"Maidstone Journal\" describes the game as \"Sir H. Mann with a select eleven of the County against S. Amherst, Esq. and the County at large, for 100 guineas\". The ACS calls the match \"Sir H. Mann v S. Amherst\". However, the next Mann-Amherst match on 29 and 30 June, also at Coxheath, is called \"East Kent v West Kent with each side having 4 gm\". This follows Haygarth, whose title is \"East Kent with Boorman and Four of Hampshire versus West Kent with Four of Surrey\". East Kent won by 8 runs and Haygarth confirms Mann and Amherst as respective managers. The guest players in this match were John Boorman, Richard Purchase, John Small, David Harris and Tom Taylor for the East and Billy Beldham, Harry Walker, Tom Walker and John Wells for the West. Apart from a couple of changes in the East Kent lineup, the same teams met again at Coxheath on 4 and 5 August, East Kent winning by 57 runs.\nThe final match between Amherst's West and Mann's East took place at Bishopsbourne from 7 to 11 September 1790. Haygarth called it \"East Kent with Purchase versus West Kent\". West Kent won by 130 runs. Sir Horatio Mann became MP for Sandwich in 1790 and reduced his involvement in cricket. The match in September 1790 is the last East Kent v. West Kent match that can be considered a major fixture."

Harry \"Buddy\" Jeannette coached them in his fourth and final season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 13-11 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nForward Warren Buehler had been the team's top scorer the previous season, but took a leave of absence from the team this season to recover from an injury. With Buehler out, junior forward Joe Missett took the lead, scoring in double figures in all but one game and averaging 18.3 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. The team's top scorer for the year, he also had 325 rebounds, a total unmatched in Georgetown history except by Merlin Wilson, who played center for the Hoyas from 1972 to 1976.\nSophomore forward Ken Pichette joined the varsity after a successful season with the freshman team the previous year. Based on his freshman performance, he was expected to take the lead in scoring for the varsity team this season with Buehler out for the year, but he got off to a slow start, not scoring until his fifth game. However, he began to score steadily in January 1956, and he scored in doubled figures in 13 of the final 14 games of the year.\nJunior forward Matt White competed with Pichette and senior forward Jack Walsh for a starting position, but he became a valuable scorer when he proved able to play effectively as a guard as well as a forward. His 24 points against Morehead State late in the season were his career high.\nThe team finished with a record of 13-11, the only winning season for Georgetown between 1952-53 and 1961-62. It had no postseason play, and was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nIn his first season, Buddy Jeannette had led Georgetown to its first-ever berth in the National Invitation Tournament; it also was only the second post-season tournament appearance in Georgetown men's basketball history and the first since the 1942-43 Hoyas played in the 1943 NCAA Tournament. A combination of injuries and academic losses led to disappointment over the next three years, and he resigned at the end of this season, departing with no other post-season tournament appearances, two winning seasons, and an overall record of 49-49 during his four-season tenure. He would later serve as head coach of the National Basketball Associations Baltimore Bullets for the 1964–65 season, as their interim head coach for part of the 1966–67 season, and as head coach of the American Basketball Association's Pittsburgh Pipers for part of the 1969–70 season.\nRoster.\nSources\n1955–56 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

In 1863 it was suggested that a monument to him should be erected. The proposal quickly gained support from the major landowners of Cheshire and John Graham, Bishop of Chester, who were all major subscribers to the project. It was agreed, because of Combermere's distinguished cavalry career, that the monument should be an equestrian statue. Carlo Marochetti, noted for his equestrian statues, was commissioned to create the work. It was also agreed that the statue should stand on a prestigious site opposite Chester Castle. Work began in 1864 but, before the work could be completed, Combermere died in February 1865. The statue was unveiled on 26 October 1865 and cost about £5,000 (). Around £7,000 had been raised from the subscriptions, and the difference was given to charitable causes. It was the first major piece of open-air public sculpture to be erected in Cheshire.\nDescription.\nThe statue consists of a bronze figure seated on a horse, standing on a pedestal of Cornish granite. The figure is about in height, and the pedestal is about high. Combermere is dressed in the uniform of a field marshal, sitting on a horse at rest with one foot raised. The pedestal is inscribed with Combermere's name and dates, and the names of the major conflicts in which he had been involved. \nAppraisal.\nThe statue was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 10 January 1972. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades of listing designated by English Heritage, and is granted to \"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\"."

        "text": "Aleksandar Popović (, was a Yugoslav tennis player of Serbian ethnicity.\nBiography.\nAleksandar Popović was born in Belgrade. In 1926 he was invited to a non Davis Cup match against Greece, which Greece won. He became the Yugoslavian national champion in singles in 1927. His final lasted only 24 games, with a final score of 6:2, 6:3, 6:1. Popović was one of the early baseliner players who hit a dozen cross-court shots before converting a point a strategy that suited him well. He was triumphant in the doubles with the same easy manner, which took him only one game more to finish the final (6:2, 6:3, 6:2).\nFortunately for Popović, György Dungyersky, the original line-up member for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Davis Cup team in their 1928 Davis Cup first round match against Finland, got sick. As he was a reserve player he stepped in to replace him. Rain was a constant factor during the match and the meeting lasted seven days instead of the usual three. The Yugoslavians didn't have much expectations on the doubles as this marked the first time Popović paired with Franjo Šefer, while the Finnish enlisted the seasoned duo of Arne Grahn and Bo Grotenfeld to oppose them. Less than a month later, at the championship of Yugoslavia in Zagreb, Popović retained his title in the international field. In the semifinals he had a tough duel with Podvineć, which he won in three sets. In the final he won with Dr. Müller as his partner.\nAfter World War II he emigrated to Switzerland, where he no longer played tennis and changed his surname."

        "text": "The 2014 Daytona 500, the 56th running of the event, was held on February 23, 2014 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Contested over 200 laps and on the asphalt tri-oval, it was the first race of the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. Dale Earnhardt Jr., driving for Hendrick Motorsports, won the race, making this his second Daytona 500 victory breaking a 55-race winless streak. Denny Hamlin finished 2nd, while Brad Keselowski, Jeff Gordon, and Jimmie Johnson rounded out the Top 5. This race had seven cautions and 42 lead changes among 18 different drivers. The top rookies of this race were polesitter Austin Dillon (9th), Alex Bowman (23rd), and Brian Scott (25th).\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees. Jimmie Johnson was the defending race winner.\nIn addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, USCC, SCCA, and Motocross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary high speed tri-oval, a sports car course, a motorcycle course, and a karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built to host racing that was being held by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThis was the 56th running of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in all of NASCAR. This race also saw the Sprint Cup Series debut of five drivers of the eight in the 2014 rookie class. It also marked Terry Labonte's 32nd and final start in the Daytona 500. His 32 starts in the race are second all-time to Dave Marcis and his 33 starts. This edition of the race turned out to be Marcos Ambrose’s final start in the Daytona 500.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the 2014 Daytona 500 was released on Friday, February 14, 2014 at 1:45 p.m. Eastern time. Forty-nine drivers were entered to qualify for the race.\nPractice.\nFirst practice February 15.\nPaul Menard was the fastest in the first practice session on February 15 with a time of 46.144 and a speed of .\nSecond practice February 15.\nRyan Newman was the fastest in the second practice session later that day with a time of 46.072 and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nRookie Austin Dillon won the pole position with a lap time of 45.914 and a speed of , while Martin Truex Jr. was second. \"This is awesome,\" Dillon said. \"It is all for our guys, and this guy right here Danny Lawrence, (head engine builder at RCR), it is his birthday. So we got him a one-two start at Daytona! That is pretty awesome.\" \"It's a tremendous amount of motivation for us and momentum for us,\" said Gil Martin, Dillon's crew chief. \"I mean, because every day you drive onto our complex, you see Richard's '3' and you see the heritage of that 3 there, so to be able to be a part of this, it's a dream come true for me, and I know it is for everybody in our whole team and our whole organization because I've watched Austin come from being a little guy to where he's at today, and it's been an amazing journey to watch. And to be a part of it now, I'm looking forward to it. I think it's going to be a great run.\"\nPractice (post-qualifying).\nThird practice February 19.\nA. J. Allmendinger was the fastest in the third practice session on February 19 with a time of 45.096 and a speed of . During the session, Joey Logano and Matt Kenseth made contact, which sent rookie Parker Kligerman into the catchfence and caused his car to land on its roof. As a result, Logano, Kligerman, Menard and Ryan Truex had to switch to backup cars for the Budweiser Duels. Dave Blaney withdrew from the race after his team was unable to secure another car.\nKligerman stated that it was the first flip of his career, and that he \"assumed it would be rougher. It was pretty soft. I was up in the fence floating along. Then it just slid over softly\". Logano stated that Kenseth had \"started making a move to go down\" and that he \"was making the run, and I was going to fill that hole. He started to come back up and I was there\".\nBudweiser Duels.\nRace One.\nAustin Dillon led the field to the green flag at 7:16 p.m., and after leading the first 14 laps, Dillon lost the lead to Dale Earnhardt Jr. on lap 15. Matt Kenseth took the lead on lap 29, and held the lead until lap 36, when he pitted and the lead was passed to Earnhardt Jr. once again. Earnhardt Jr. and Kasey Kahne each held the lead for a lap before Kenseth cycled back to the lead with 21 laps to go. On the last lap, Kevin Harvick pulled up alongside Matt Kenseth, while Kahne got to the inside, creating a three-wide photo finish in which Kenseth prevailed. Michael McDowell and Joe Nemechek failed to make the Daytona 500. Kenseth stated that he \"was kind of embarrassed to walk in the garage\" but felt that his race performance \"builds confidence in all of us, makes us feel like you can go out and get the job done if everybody does their jobs and we do everything right\". Harvick's car failed post-race inspection because his car exceeded the maximum split on the track bar. He was disqualified, but his speed in qualifying was enough to get him into the Daytona 500. Greg Zipadelli, the competitions director at Harvick's team – Stewart-Haas Racing – referred to the infraction as \"an adjustment during the race and it was more than it should have been\".\nRace Two.\nMartin Truex Jr. led the field to the green flag at 8:40 p.m., and Brad Keselowski took the lead on lap 3. Keselowski held the race lead for the next portion of the race, holding it until his pit stop on lap 35, which handed the lead to Casey Mears. On his pit stop, Keselowski was deemed to have been speeding while exiting, and had to serve a pass-through penalty. Denny Hamlin took the lead with 22 laps to go, and maintained the race lead until the end of the race, winning under caution.\nComing through turn four on the final lap, Jimmie Johnson ran out of gas, got loose after being tapped in the left corner panel, overcorrected and hit the wall collecting Jamie McMurray in the process. Truex Jr. had no way to avoid the wreck and rear-ended McMurray. While slowing to avoid the wreck, Clint Bowyer got rear-ended by Ryan Truex, slid to the runoff area taking David Ragan with him. Bowyer flipped over in the air and landed on all four wheels with the only damage being a destroyed drive-train. Ragan and Michael Waltrip were also caught in the wreck and both hit the inside wall head-on. Carl Edwards was caught by McMurray, but sustained minimal damage. McMurray made contact with Johnson again as they continued on into the grass, destroying the front ends of their cars. Bobby Labonte and Terry Labonte, who were both 30 seconds behind the leader on the final lap, raced their way into the Daytona 500, at the expense of Eric McClure, Morgan Shepherd and Ryan Truex. Hamlin's team owner, Joe Gibbs, stated Hamlin had \"worked extremely hard\" for the result, and he thought his team was \"all hungry when the year started\".\nPractice (post-duel).\nFourth practice February 19.\nDenny Hamlin was the fastest in the fourth practice session on February 19 with a time of 45.096 and a speed of .\nFifth practice February 21.\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. was the fastest in the fifth practice session on February 21 with a time of 45.679 and a speed of .\nFinal practice February 22.\nKurt Busch was the fastest in the final practice session on February 22 with a time of 45.541 and a speed of .\nRace.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nAustin Dillon started on pole, but led only the first lap. On the next lap, Denny Hamlin took the lead from Dillon. On lap 11, Hamlin dropped back, letting Kurt Busch take the lead. The first caution came out on lap 23 when Kyle Larson spun in turn 2 after getting two flat tires. Paul Menard assumed the lead on the restart and led for five laps, before Hamlin passed him for the lead. Kyle Busch passed him a lap later for the lead. On lap 31, Martin Truex Jr.'s engine blew up, bringing out the second caution a lap later.\nRain delay.\nWhile the field was under caution, it began to rain and by lap 39, the red flag was thrown with Kyle Busch leading the race. At 2:50 p.m. local time, a tornado warning was issued for the speedway area and the grandstands were evacuated. The red flag lasted for 6 hours and 22 minutes as track-drying was delayed due to ongoing rain showers; this would make it the longest rain delay in Daytona 500 history. The race restarted at 8:52 p.m. local time.\nRestart.\nAfter the red flag was lifted, the race ran seven laps under caution while the Air Titan did a pass over pit road. After pit stops, the race restarted on lap 47, with Kyle Busch still leading. Busch and Kasey Kahne traded the lead over the next few laps, before both faded and the Team Penske Fords of Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano took the point and swapped the lead for several laps. Menard also led seven laps during this time. During green flag pit stops around lap 85, Trevor Bayne, Aric Almirola, A. J. Allmendinger, Justin Allgaier, Michael Waltrip and Danica Patrick briefly held the lead for a couple laps at a time due to different pit strategies. Also during the cycle, moisture at the exit of pit road from the heavy rain shower caused Kahne to spin out into the grass exiting pit road and Kyle Busch pulled an air hose out of his stall exiting pit road, resulting in a pass through penalty – despite these incidents, the race remained under green.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nWhen the pit stop cycle ended, Paul Menard was on point, where he stayed until lap 107, when Jimmie Johnson took the lead and held it for 9 laps, until Keselowski took it on lap 116. Five laps later, Johnson passed Keselowski back for the lead, and held it until another cycle of pit stops on lap 127. At the conclusion of this cycle, Dale Earnhardt Jr. assumed the lead on lap 131 for the first time. He held the lead for thirteen laps, until lap 144, when Carl Edwards passed him. A lap later, Earnhardt retook the lead from Edwards.\nThe \"Big One\".\nOn lap 145, the third caution came out for a crash on the front straightaway. It started when Kevin Harvick and Brian Scott made contact in the exit of turn 4, sending Scott into Almirola. Almirola shot across the track and collected several more cars including Patrick, Waltrip, Parker Kligerman, Paul Menard, David Gilliland, Josh Wise, Austin Dillon, Justin Allgaier, Kasey Kahne and Marcos Ambrose. Patrick took the worst hit, as her car got turned by Almirola and slammed the outside wall in the tri-oval in a part of the track that lacked a SAFER barrier; the section of wall where Patrick hit the wall would receive a SAFER barrier before the rain-shortened Coke Zero 400 that summer. Upon exiting her car, Patrick felt \"upset because the car felt really good, it was the best car [she's] had all of Speedweeks\" and that her car \"could catch whoever and move around...and move forward\". Waltrip was more forthright in his thoughts on the crash, stating he \"was going to be fine\" but that another car \"cleaned our clock from behind\".\nClosing stages.\nGreg Biffle assumed the lead from Earnhardt Jr. on lap 151 after pit stops. He led the restart on lap 154, but Earnhardt Jr. quickly regained the lead for two laps, before Biffle repassed him. Biffle led for three more laps before Earnhardt Jr. repassed him on lap 159. On lap 162, the fourth caution came out for a crash in turn 4 at the back of the pack. It occurred when Kyle Larson spun in turn 4 from contact with Dillon, causing major damage to several more cars including Marcos Ambrose, Kahne, Annett, Jamie McMurray, Ryan Newman, Brian Scott, Brian Vickers and Casey Mears. Earnhardt Jr. continued to lead on the restart on lap 169. He led until lap 173, when Biffle again passed him for the lead. Biffle led for two laps before he was passed by Edwards for the lead. Edwards led three laps, before Earnhardt Jr. passed them back for a lap, before handing the lead back to Edwards for four more laps. Earnhardt Jr. gained the lead for the last time on lap 183.\nFinish.\nOn lap 184, the fifth caution flag came out when Bayne's car snapped loose and crashed into the outside wall on the back straightaway. When the race restarted on lap 188, Earnhardt Jr. moved in front of Johnson to secure the lead. On lap 194, the sixth caution came out for a crash in turn 3. It started when Austin Dillon turned Ryan Newman. Newman's car turned sideways and collected five more cars, including Allgaier, Scott, Kligerman, Terry Labonte, and Cole Whitt, and set up a two lap shootout for the last restart. Although close on fuel and with a piece of bear bond from Newman's car stuck to his grill, Earnhardt Jr. took off on the last restart, moving in front of Jeff Gordon. Over the course of the last lap, an intense battle for the runner-up spots unfolded between Gordon, Hamlin, Johnson and Keselowski. Heading through turn 4, Harvick tried to force himself between McMurray and Kyle Busch in turn 4, and a wreck ensued as Harvick was sent into the wall, collecting a number of other cars including McMurray, Busch, Edwards, and Reed Sorenson. While that was happening, Earnhardt Jr. held off Hamlin and took the caution and checkered flags to score his second Daytona 500 victory. Earnhardt Jr. stated that his car was \"awesome\" and after some help from Gordon on the restart, Earnhardt Jr. \"just took care of it from there\".\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001, (except for 2002, 2004 and 2006) the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox. The booth crew has remained the same since the beginning with longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap commentator Mike Joy, two-time Daytona 500 winning crew chief Larry McReynolds, and 1989 Daytona 500 winner Darrell Waltrip. This was the final 500 on Fox for Steve Byrnes, Krista Voda, and Jeff Hammond. Fox repeated the 2013 Daytona 500 during the rain delay, confusing many viewers. When Fox showed Jimmie Johnson's winning moment from the 2013 race, he received a large number of congratulatory tweets. He was unaware that Fox had repeated the previous year's race during the rain delay.\nRadio.\nThe 2014 Daytona 500 was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. MRN Radio has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970. Joe Moore and Barney Hall covered the race from the booth. Longtime turn announcer and prodigy of MRN co-founder Ken Squier Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer. He called the race when the field was racing through turns 1 &amp; 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the Daytona 500. Jeff Striegle called the race when the field was racing through turns 3 &amp; 4. On pit road, MRN was manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelly. Alongside him were Steve Post, Woody Cain, and Pete Pistone."

        "title": "1965–66 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1965–66 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1965–66 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached it in his sixth and final season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 16-8 and no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nIn the previous season, Georgetown had started strong, raising hopes for a post-season tournament berth, but lost seven of its final 10 games to drop out of consideration for post-season play. This year, the Hoyas had a mediocre start, going 5-5 in their first ten games, but three of those losses came by a combined total of only six points. They began the new year of 1966 with eight straight wins by an average 17-point margin. During the streak, they won back-to-back victories of 103-74 over George Washington and 104-73 over New York University (NYU); the Hoyas would not have back-to-back 100-plus-point games again until December 2018. The winning streak pushed Georgetowns record to 13-5, and hopes of a post-season tournament berth were high.\nSenior guard Jim Brown was a talented point guard who led the 1965-66 team to an average of 83.8 points scored per game, a Georgetown record that still stands. Brown scored in double figures in 17 of the seasons 24 games and led the team in scoring in four games. He shot 84% from the free-throw line, and had school records with 177 assists and 7.38 assists per game; the assists record stood for 14 years, and the assists-per-game record still stands.\nJunior forward Steve Sullivan led the team in scoring and averaged 9.7 rebounds per game. He scored 30 points against Boston College, had 27 points and 18 rebounds against Fordham, and put in a 25-point performance in the Navy game.\nSophomore guard Dennis Cesar, a free-throw-shooting expert, joined the varsity team after a successful year on the freshman team the previous season. As a reserve, he came off the bench to score 21 points against Loyola early in the season. He became a starter in January 1966, and his per-game scoring average rose after that to 13.3 points. During the eight-game winning streak, he scored a combined 47 points in the two games against George Washington. Two of his free throws were key to Georgetowns upset of Rutgers, a big win in what turned out to the last game of the streak.\nSophomore guard Bruce Stinebrickner also arrived on the varsity after a year on the freshman team. He had turned down offers from 20 other schools, including Duke and Harvard, to attend Georgetown. He was an excellent defensive asset for the Hoyas, and also averaged 9.6 points per game.\nJunior center Frank Hollendoner was limited by an eye injury and knee problems during the season. Nonetheless, he set a school record for points scored in a half by scoring 29 points in the first half against NYU. He finished the year averaging 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game.\nSenior forward Jim Barry – perhaps the greatest player of Georgetown mens basketballs \"Classic Era\" (1943-1972) – had missed the 1963-64 season while recovering from knee surgery. He had had a strong year in 1964-65, but knee problems returned to plague him this season. He played mostly as a reserve, but still averaged 11.7 points per game and had 22-point performances against both Loyola and Villanova. Senior forward John \"Jake\" Gibbons also played in a reserve role, but nonetheless averaged almost nine points and five rebounds a game and shot 48% from the field for the season.\nThe eight-game win streak ended when 13–5 Georgetown met eighth-ranked St. Joseph's (16–4) at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both teams entered the game with postseason hopes, but the Hoyas had not beaten the Hawks since 1956, and they did not in this meeting; although St. Josephs led by only three points midway through the first half, they pulled away rapidly from there, leading by 20 points at the half on the way to a 111-73 victory over the Hoyas. The lopsided loss effectively ended the Hoyas' hopes for a postseason tournament bid and halted their momentum, and they lost their next two games as well. They recovered to win their final three games, with a 20-point effort by Dennis Cesar against Seton Hall, 22 points including the winning shot in the final seconds by Gibbons against Fairfield, and back-to-back 28-point performances by Hollendoner in the final two games of the season against Fairfield and Canisius, giving them 11 wins in their last 14 games of the year. Although they won more games than any other Georgetown team had since the 1946-47 season, their 16-8 record – the best record of O'Keefes six-year tenure as head coach – was not enough for them to receive an invitation to a post-season tournament in the wake of the blowout loss to St. Joseph's.\nAlthough it had no post-season play, the class of 1966 finished with a record of 44-28 during its three varsity seasons combined. It was the first Georgetown class to post a winning record for its collegiate career since 1930.\nGeorgetown's head coaching position paid so little that O'Keefe could only serve as a part-time coach and held a full-time job outside of coaching in order to make ends meet, impairing his ability to recruit players. After the end of the season he resigned in order to devote himself full-time to his business concerns, prompting Georgetown to commit to hiring a full-time coach beginning with the following season. OKeefe departed with a winning record (82-60) and no sub-.500 performances by the team, but also without the Hoyas having appeared in the post-season during his six years as head coach.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nSources\n1965–66 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1964–65 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1964–65 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached them in his fifth season as head coach, but Georgetown's head coaching position paid so little that he could only coach part-time and held a full-time job outside of coaching in order to meet his financial obligations, impairing his ability to recruit players. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 13-10 and had no postseason play.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown \"Classic Era\" (1943-1972) teams usually lacked the height and size necessary to be truly competitive, but the 1964-65 team generated excitement because high-scoring junior forward Jim Barry – perhaps the best player of the Classic Era – was returning after missing the previous season while recovering from knee surgery, and because three large and talented sophomores – 6-foot-11 (211-cm) center Frank Hollendoner, 6-foot-10 (208-cm) center-forward Neil Heskin, and 6-foot-8 (203-cm) forward Steve Sullivan – were joining the varsity after a strong season on the freshman team. For the first time, \"Sports Illustrated\" picked Georgetown as one of its Top 20 teams as the season began, and hopes were high that the Hoyas would break their drought and earn a berth in a postseason tournament.\nAn early blow to the team came in November 1964, three weeks before the seasons first game. Junior guard Jim Brown and junior forward Owen Gillen had taken part in an off-season Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Easter basketball tournament in the spring of 1964, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) disallowed the tournament and suspended both players for the first nine games of the 1964-65 season. They thus could not join the team until January 1965. In his first game back with the team, Gillen scored 18 points against Navy, which he followed with a 16-point performance against Delaware four days later. He averaged 13 points and seven rebounds per game for the year and 8.6 rebounds per game for his career, which ended after this season when he did not return for his senior season because of academic issues. Brown, meanwhile, appeared in 14 games and averaged 9.6 points per game.\nWhile Brown and Gillen served their suspensions, junior forward John \"Jake\" Gibbons scored 42 points in a game at Canisius on December 19, 1964, falling only two points short of the schools single-game scoring record, a 44-point performance by guard Jim Christy the preceding February. Ten days later he scored 21 points against Richmond, and he later had a 15-point game against Navy. He finished the year shooting 53% from the field and 70% from the free-throw line, averaging 11.1 points per game.\nInjuries to Heskin, Hollendoner, and Sullivan were another blow to the team. Hollendoner, a highly prized recruit who had received 143 scholarship offers and had chosen Georgetown because of its mathematics program, came off the bench to score 19 points in the season opener against Loyola, then scored 17 against Canisius, had 18 points and 18 rebounds against Delaware, and had another 18 points against George Washington; injuries reduced his playing time as the season wore on, and after a season-high 24 points and 17 rebounds against St. Joseph's he was limited to spot duty. Sullivan badly injured his ankle prior to the season opener and the injury hampered him all season, limiting him to 18 games and an average of 7.6 points per game; highlights for him were 23 points against La Salle and 15 points and 15 rebounds against American.\nBarry led the team in scoring for the season, shooting 47% from the field and 86% from the free-throw line and averaging 19.1 points per game. At Fairleigh Dickinson on February 27, 1965, he set the all-time Georgetown scoring record for a single game with 46 points, shooting 17-for-27 (63.0%) from the field and 12-for-14 (85.7%) from the free-throw line to beat Jim Christys record 44 points set a year and two days earlier. Three days later, Barry shot 13-for-13 from the free-throw line at American and passed the 1,000-point mark for his collegiate career. Over the course of the two games, he set records for scoring, field goals, and free-throw accuracy never equalled at Georgetown.\nThe team started strong, going 9-3 in its first 12 games despite the suspension of Brown and Gillen. However, the injuries to Heskin, Hollendoner, and Sullivan hurt the Hoyas down the stretch, and they lost seven games in a row and seven of their final 10 games. Georgetown finished with a record of 13-10 and had no post-season play.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road.

        "text": "Scarborough Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club, based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The club was founded in 1849, and is a member of the Yorkshire Premier League North.\nGround.\nThe North Marine Road is a 11,500-capacity ground in Scarborough and the base for Scarborough Cricket Club. The two 'ends' are known as the Peasholm Park End and the Trafalgar Square End. First established in 1863, Scarborough Cricket Club's North Marine Road Ground held a record 22,946 people who watched Yorkshire play Derbyshire in 1947, back in the days when it was known as The Queen's Cricket Ground. North Marine Road includes 2 grass practice nets and 5 all-weather net facilities. The ground and its buildings were refurbished the year it was named as The Guardian's ground of the year in 2011.\nHistory.\nThe Club was originally formed in 1849 in a meeting held in The Queen Hotel (later to become The Cricketers Pub and now Retirement apartments) on North Marine Road. The early matches were played on rough land opposite the Queen Hotel, the first match being in September of 1849 against Filey. As the Club developed, important matches were played at Castle Hill on a ground prepared at the direction of the Army for the local Rifle Volunteers. Often, the practice of the Riflemen conflicted with matches and eventually this became a contributing factor for developing the ground opposite the Queen Hotel. A match was organised in 1862 for a Scarborough Twenty (players) against an All England XI at Castle Hill, it proved to be a success with large crowds attending, and as a result it became an annual event, and the Club was reconstituted the following year. Lord Derwent was appointed President. The Pavilion was built in 1896 and at around the same time the covered seating at the Trafalgar Square End (the Enclosure) was built, as was the seating on the Popular Bank. The concrete North Stand was added in 1926 and the West Stand was erected in 1956 replacing a long low building which had been known as the Cow Sheds. Scarborough entered the National Club Knock-Out Competition in 1972 and progressed all the way to Lord's to meet Brentham Cricket Club in the Final. The Trophy was brought back to Scarborough in style with a six wicket win. In the seven years of the Haig Trophy (as it then became known), Scarborough were winners on four occasions: 1976, 1979 1981 and 1982. Scarborough Cricket Club's five wins remains unsurpassed in the ECB National Club Cricket Championship. Major rebuilding of the pavilion, tea rooms, new toilets and a new club shop opened on North Marine Road in time for the 2012 season.\nThe club's 1st XI senior team compete in the Yorkshire Premier League North, their 2nd XI senior team compete in the York &amp; District Senior Cricket League the 3rd XI play in the Scarborough Beckett Cricket League, there's a Senior team in the Scarborough and District Evening Cricket League, and they have a very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Derwent Valley Junior Cricket League.\nClub Performance.\nThe Yorkshire Premier League North competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2016.\nNote: Solly Sports Yorkshire ECB County Premier League was dispanded after the 2015 season, and the 1st XI team moved to the new Yorkshire Premier League North the following year.\nThe Scarborough Beckett Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2010.\nNotable players.\nSome notable players for Scarborough CC have included:"

        "title": "1960–61 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1960–61 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1960–61 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tommy O'Keefe coached them in his first season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. The team finished with a record of 11-10 and had no post-season play, but it was the first Georgetown team to have a winning record since the 1955-56 season.\nAfter Tom Nolan left the head coaching position after the end of the previous season to focus on coaching the Georgetown baseball team, Georgetown hired his assistant, O'Keefe, as his replacement. O'Keefe had been a stand-out on Hoya teams from 1946 to 1950. After that, the National Basketball Associations Washington Capitols selected him in the fourth round of the 1950 NBA draft, and he played for one season in the NBA, splitting it between the Capitols and the Baltimore Bullets. He later served under Nolan as assistant coach at Georgetown from 1956 to 1960. Georgetowns head coaching position paid so little that during his six seasons as head coach, he could coach the Hoyas only part-time, holding a full-time job time outside of coaching in order to make ends meet, and this impaired his ability to spend time on recruiting players. The team would never have a losing record during his tenure as head coach, but also would make no post-season tournament appearances.\nThe season is notable for Georgetown's final game of the year, a lopsided defeat of an NYU team which after the season concluded was implicated in a major point-shaving scandal.\nSeason recap.\nSenior forward and team captain Tom Coleman scored a total of 52 points in the two games the Hoyas played in the Gulf South Classic in Shreveport, Louisiana, in late December 1960 as Georgetown won an in-season tournament for the first time since the 1952-53 season. In the Hoyas upset win over Fordham in January 1961, he had one of the best games of his collegiate career, scoring 21 points and pulling down 13 rebounds.\nSenior guard Brian \"Puddy\" Sheehan played point guard and for the third straight season led the team in scoring. An excellent ballhandler, he had many assists in the era before assists were tracked regularly by record keepers. He played in all 21 games and scored in double figures in 15 of them, with a season-high 28 points against Boston College and a 16-point, 14-assist game against New York University (NYU) at Madison Square Garden in New York City in the final game of the year.\nJunior guard Jim Carrino became a starter this season and complemented Sheehan in the backcourt. A good outside shooter also capable of driving at the basket, he shot 44% from the field and scored 15 or more points nine times. He scored 24 points in the NYU game.\nAfter struggling in his sophomore year the previous season, junior center Bob Sharpenter improved his shooting and inside play. He scored in 20 of the seasons 21 games, had four 20-plus-point performances, and averaged 12.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. He would emerge fully as one of Georgetowns great players as a senior the following season.\nJunior forward Paul \"Tag\" Tagliabue led the team in rebounds. Like Sheehan, he played in all 21 games and scored in double figures 15 times, with a season-high 21 points against Rhode Island.\nPlaying under a new coach and suffering from injuries that limited his playing time, senior forward Tom Matan appeared in only 16 games, but scored 21 points in the game against American. Although his sophomore year had been his most productive, he was a reliable shooter throughout his three-year varsity career and had played a big role in many of the more important games of his era.\nGeorgetown's season concluded with the 10–10 Hoyas visiting New York City to face NYU at Madison Square Garden before a crowd of 2,573 on March 2, 1961. Coming off a very successful season in 1959–1960 that included a 70–48 drubbing of the Hoyas at McDonough Gymnasium in the schools' most recent meeting and a Final Four run in the 1960 NCAA Tournament, NYU had played inconsistently during the 1960–61 season and entered the game with a record of 11–9, but the Violets had won four straight games and averaged 72 points a game, and New York-area sportswriters viewed them as a heavy favorite to beat the Hoyas. The Hoyas played one of their best games of the season, hitting 44 percent of their field-goal attempts (against a season average of 41 percent) and 64 percent of their free throws (against a season average of 67 percent). Carrino led the team with 24 points, while three Georgetown players (Sheehan with 16 points and 11 assists, Sharpenter with 11 points and 14 rebounds, and Tagliabue with 11 points and 12 rebounds) finished with double-doubles. Only NYU guard Mark Reiner shot well. The Violets' top scorer for the season, forward Al Filardi, a 48 percent field-goal shooter, went 1-for-10 from the field, and center Al Barden, a 31 percent shooter, had a 1-for-8 game. NYU shot 30 percent from the field (against a 40 percent season average) and 46 percent in free throws (against a 68 percent season average). On offense, Sheehan dominated Violets guard Art Loche, who a week earlier had shut down Wake Forest guard Billy Packer, and Sharpenter and Tagliabue grabbed a combined 26 rebounds, while Barden and his fellow center Tom Boose seemed unable to pull down any rebounds at all for NYU. The Hoyas led 39–32 at halftime and 48–32 three-and-a-half minutes into the second half, and later pulled out to a 30-point lead on the way to a 92–69 victory, handing the Violets their second-worst defeat of the season, exceeded only by a 93–69 loss at UCLA. The one-sided game puzzled many observers. Only after the end of the season did an investigation result in the arrest of 37 players from 22 different colleges for point shaving in a major gambling scandal that rocked college basketball in the United States. Among those arrested was NYU guard Ray Popracky — the only Violets player implicated — who had played opposite Tagliabue during the game and had accepted $1,300 for point-shaving in four NYU games during the season, including the Georgetown game, during which he had shot 4-for-12 from the field.\nThe 1960-61 team finished with a record of 11-10, giving Georgetown its first winning season since 1955–1956. The team had no post-season play and was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nJunior forward Paul Tagliabue later became Commissioner of the National Football League.\nSources\n1960–61 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "1959–60 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1959–60 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1959–60 NCAA University Division college basketball season. Tom Nolan coached them in his fourth and final season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. The team finished with a record of 11-12 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nDiminutive junior guard Brian \"Puddy\" Sheehan, the teams point guard and a dominant player throughout his college career, had emerged the previous season as Georgetowns top scorer on an undersized team. He continued as such this season among taller teammates, averaging 21.3 points per game in his first six games, including a 29-point performance against Saint Peter's and 27 against Niagara. In the ninth game of the year, he scored 23 points against Providence in the championship game of the Providence Invitational Tournament. Despite usually playing against opponents who were six inches (15 cm) taller, he was Georgetowns top scorer for the second straight year, averaging 15.6 points per game for the season.\nEither Sheehan or junior center Tom Coleman led the team in scoring in 15 games. In addition to providing a strong defensive presence, Coleman scored in double figures ten times, with 24 against Fordham and a season-high 26 versus Boston College.\nSophomore guard Jim Carrino joined the varsity team this year after a season on the freshman team. As reserve during the year, he nonetheless provided welcome assistance to Sheehan in the backcourt, coming off the bench to average 12.2 points per game and score in 12 games, including 18 points against Brown, 24 against Fordham, and 26 against Boston College. An injury cut his season short and he appeared in only 15 games, but his performance earned him a starting spot on the next year's team.\nSophomore forward Paul \"Tag\" Tagliabue also joined the varsity team this season after a year on the freshman team. He scored in double figures in eight of his last ten games and demonstrated a willingness to fight for rebounds under the basket; he led the Hoyas in rebounding for the season, and, as a three-year starter, was destined to become one of the top rebounders in school history.\nAnother sophomore, center Bob Sharpenter, had been a high school standout and a top scorer on the freshman team the previous season, but he struggled with the transition to the varsity this year. Playing in only 12 games, he averaged only 4.5 points per game and shot only 34% from the field, and also showed defensive weaknesses. He would correct his shooting and defense the following season, and by his senior year would emerge as one of Georgetowns great players.\nJunior forward Tom Matan had been a standout the previous season, but with taller players like Tagliabue and Sharpenter now on the team, he moved to a swing role in which he was not as productive. Nonetheless, he scored in double figures six times and had a season-high 21 points against Fairfield.\nThe 1959-60 team finished with a record of 11-12 and had no post-season play. The last Georgetown men's basketball team with a losing record until the 1967-68 season, it was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nNolan left the head coaching position after the end of the season to focus on coaching the Georgetown baseball team, which he did through the 1978 season. He departed with a 40-49 record during his four-season tenure, with no winning seasons and no post-season tournament appearances. Georgetown hired assistant coach and former Georgetown and National Basketball Association (NBA) player Tommy O'Keefe as his replacement.\nRoster.\nSources\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nSenior guard and team captain Ed Hargaden Jr., was the first second-generation Georgetown mens basketball player, his father, guard Ed Hargaden, having been a standout guard on the 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35 teams. He also was the only second-generation player in school history until center Patrick Ewings son, forward Patrick Ewing Jr., joined the team in the 2006-07 season.\nSophomore forward Paul Tagliabue later became Commissioner of the National Football League.\n1959–60 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

The competition was based on the Single FITA round.\nFrom 1979 to 1991, the Double FITA format was used.\nFrom 1989, the gold medals awarded were reduced to 4, with one each for men's individual, men's team, women's individual and women's team event.\nFrom 2005, the compound archery event was introduced, increasing the number of medals to 8.\nFrom 2011, the mixed team event was introduced.\nThe current format of individual elimination rounds only allows the top two archers from each nation to enter. Therefore, for example, if three archers from the same nation top the rankings from 1 to 3, only archers 1 and 2 are allowed to enter the knockout rounds."

        "title": "ECAC men's basketball tournaments",
        "text": "The ECAC men's basketball tournaments are postseason college basketball tournaments organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).\nDespite its name, the ECAC is not a traditional athletic conference, but rather a loosely organized sports federation for colleges and universities in the northeastern United States. Among other things, it organizes end-of-season college basketball tournaments for member schools which are not members of a traditional conference, or which do not otherwise have access to such a tournament. At various times, it has organized end-of-season basketball tournaments at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, and Division III levels.\nDivision I.\nFrom 1975 to 1982, the ECAC organized annual regional end-of-season men's basketball tournaments for independent Division I ECAC member colleges and universities in the Northeastern United States. The winner of each regional tournament was declared the ECAC regional champion for the season and received an automatic bid in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nBefore 1975, the ECAC had not organized such tournaments for Division I schools; the NCAA tournament invited only one team per Division I conference and accommodated independents with a limited number of at-large bids. In 1975, however, the NCAA tournament's field expanded to 32 teams, including the champions of end-of-season conference tournaments, who received automatic bids. Although a number of at-large bids still existed, the process for selecting the field for the 1975 NCAA tournament included many second-place conference teams and threatened to exclude independent schools in the northeastern United States, which had no end-of-season conference tournament to play in and therefore no automatic bids. With no conventional athletic conferences yet in existence in the Northeast, the ECAC began to organize its Division I basketball tournaments in 1975, allowing Northeastern independents to retain their independent status while still having an opportunity to play in an end-of-season tournament offering an automatic bid. The ECAC Division I tournaments thus assured that at least some Northeastern colleges and universities would receive NCAA tournament bids.\nIn both 1975 and 1976, the ECAC organized four regional Division I tournaments: Metro (for the New York City area and New Jersey); New England; South (for Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.); and Upstate (for Upstate New York). As Eastern independent colleges and universities began to join existing conferences or form new ones and play in their own end-of-season conference tournaments, the number of ECAC regional tournaments declined due to reduced demand for them. After the formation of the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League (which later became the Atlantic 10 Conference), the ECAC combined its Southern and Upstate Regions into a single \"Southern\" (later \"Upstate-Southern\" and \"South-Upstate\") Region and held only three regional tournaments in 1977, 1978, and 1979. After the teams that played in the New England region all joined the Big East Conference, the Atlantic 10 Conference, or the new ECAC North Conference (which later became the America East Conference), the ECAC also did away with its New England tournament, and in 1980 and 1981 it held only two tournaments, Metro and Southern. Many of the teams in the Metro Region then formed the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), and in 1982 the ECAC held two tournaments, reorganized as the Metro-South (composed of former Metro Region teams which had not joined the MAAC) and South tournaments.\nAfter the completion of the 1982 post-season, the remaining ECAC Metro-South Region teams formed the ECAC-Metro Conference (which later became the Northeast Conference), while the ECAC South Region teams formed the ECAC South Conference (which later became the Colonial Athletic Association). With all the former independents in the northeastern United States having joined a traditional conference holding its own end-of-season tournament, and with the National Invitation Tournament providing a means of postseason tournament play for Division I teams not invited to the NCAA tournament, the ECAC had no reason to continue its Division I basketball tournament series, and it ceased to organize such tournaments after 1982.\n1975 tournaments.\n\"National rankings indicated.\"\nRegional champions.\nSources\nBrackets.\nSources\nMetro\nNew England\nSouthern\nUpstate\n1976 tournaments.\n\"National rankings indicated.\"Sources\nBrackets.\nMetro\nNew England\nSouthern\nUpstate\n1977 tournaments.\n\"National rankings indicated.\"\nRegional champions.\nSources\nBrackets.\nSource\nMetro\nNote: The Manhattan-St. Johns semifinal game was held at Rose Hill Gymnasium, Bronx, NY. The Army-Seton Hall semifinal game took place at Yanitelli Center, Jersey City, NJ.\nNew England\nThe 1977 New England Tournaments semifinal games contrasted with one another greatly: Holy Cross, led by freshman guard Ronnie Perry, played a hard, physical game – with 45 free throws in the second half, 24 by Holy Cross and 21 by Connecticut – to defeat Connecticut 89-77, while Providence, led by senior guard Joe Hassett, found its offense lacking and used tough defensive play to overcome Fairfield 44-31. The much-anticipated championship game that followed – a rematch of the December 1976 Colonial Classic final played at the Boston Garden, in which Holy Cross had handed Providence one of only three losses the Friars suffered all season on a game-winning last-second shot by the Crusaders Chris Potter – was played before a sold-out crowd at the Hartford Civic Center and was one of the greatest games in the eight-season history of the ECAC Division I tournaments. With less than a minute to play and his team behind, Holy Crosss Michael Vicens stole the ball along his own end line and raced down the court to score on a reverse dunk. This energized both the crowd and the Holy Cross players and swung the games momentum in favor of Holy Cross. The Crusaders got the ball with less than 10 seconds to go, and Potter scored on an 18-foot (5.5-meter) jumper with five seconds remaining to again give Holy Cross a win, 68-67. Holy Cross thus won an automatic bid to the 1977 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and made its first appearance in that tournament since 1956. Providence also reached the NCAA tournament via an at-large bid.\nSouthern\nNote: The St. Bonaventure-Syracuse semifinal game was held at Manley Field House, Syracuse, NY.

From 1973 through 1975 and from 1977 through 1980, it held four regional tournaments – Metro (for the New York City area and New Jersey), New England, Southern (for schools south of New York and New Jersey), and Upstate (for Upstate New York) – each year, while in 1976 it held only three tournaments (Metro, New England, and Upstate).\nAfter 1980, the ECAC divided the Division II and Division III competitions, placing the Division II competitions on hiatus until 1988 and beginning Division III-only tournaments in 1981.\nDivision II tournaments.\nAfter 1980, the ECAC placed Division II end-of-season tournament competition on hiatus until 1988. From 1988 through 2005 it organized a single annual Division II men's basketball tournament as an invitational event for Division II ECAC teams not invited to that years NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament. No tournament took place in 2006, but the ECAC held it twice more, in 2007 and 2008. The Division II tournament again went on hiatus from 2009 through 2013, thanks to various factors including an expansion of the NCAA Men's Division II Tournament field and a decline in the number of Division II men's basketball programs associated with the ECAC. A Division II tournament took place in 2014, but the tournament again went on hiatus after that.\nDivision III tournaments.\nAfter its last combined Division II/III regional tournaments in 1980, the ECAC split Division II and Division III tournament competition. In 1981, it held its first Division III-only postseason regional invitational men's basketball tournaments for ECAC teams not invited to the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament, and these have occurred annually ever since. The ECAC organized these tournaments regionally, holding Metro (for the New York City area and New Jersey), New England, and Upstate (for Upstate New York) tournaments from 1981 to 1985 and adding a Southern tournament (for schools south of New York and New Jersey) in 1986. In 2013, the ECAC returned to a three-tournament structure, holding Metro, New England, and Southern regional tournaments, while in 2014 it had four tournaments (Metro, New England, Southeast, and Southwest). In 2015 and 2016, it again had a three-tournament structure, with New England, Metro, and South tournaments. In 2017, it changed format again, becoming a single tournament which determined a single ECAC Division III champion. No tournament took place in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tournament resumed in 2022."

        "text": "The 1970–71 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1970–71 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his fifth season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 12-14 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nIn recent seasons, Georgetown had established a pattern of strong starts followed by late-season collapses that sank hopes for a berth in a post-season tournament, losing seven of its final 10 games in the 1964-65 season, eight of its final 11 games in 1966-67, and seven of its last nine games in 1968-69. In 1969-70, however, it had played well enough for a bid in the 1970 National Invitation Tournament and had come close to defeating Pete Maravich and his Louisiana State teammates in the first round. With junior forward Art White – generally viewed at the time as the greatest player in Georgetown basketball history – as well as senior guard Don Weber and junior forward Mike Laughna returning, Magee had high hopes that a new era of success had dawned in Georgetown men's basketball.\nLaughna had a strong season, shooting 48.2% from the field. Over the course of three consecutive games in February 1971 against American, Loyola, and New York University (NYU), he scored 76 points and pulled down 50 rebounds, and in the NYU game alone he grabbed 11 rebounds and scored 35 points, the only 30-plus-point scoring performance in a single game by a Georgetown player during the 1970s. During the season, he led the team in scoring in 14 games, including 10 of the last 11. White, meanwhile, scored in double figures in 21 of the seasons 26 games and averaged 14.2 points per game, and Weber closed out his collegiate career by scoring in double figures 13 times, shooting 44% from the field, and leading the team in assists for the second straight year with 100.\nMagees hope that the 1970-71 team would build on the success of the previous year went unfulfilled: The team played very poorly on defense and, after opening 3-5 and then winning six of its next eight to improve to 9-7, it returned to the pattern of the teams of the latter half of the 1960s, losing seven of its last 10 games. The season culminated in a meeting with longtime rival Fordham, ranked No. 13 in the Associated Press Poll, before a sellout crowd at McDonough Gymnasium on March 4, 1971. Rams guard/forward Charlie Yelverton scored 38 points to lead Fordham to an 81–68 victory that gave the Rams a 22–2 record, and the win clinched Fordham's first bid to the NCAA tournament since 1954.\nGeorgetown finished the season with a record of 12-14 and had no post-season play. Magees relationship with the team deteriorated as the season wore on. Praising only Laughna — when asked what lineup he would use for the team the following season, he said, \"Laughna and four others\" — Magee otherwise openly blamed the years results on the performance of his players, specifically calling White \"a disappointment\" in an interview with the campus newspaper \"The Hoya\". White did not return to the team for the following season because of academic issues, presaging a dismal Hoya performance in 1971-72.\nThe 1970-71 team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nSource\n1970–71 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Morocco competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The country's participation at Vancouver marked its sixth appearance at a Winter Olympics since its debut at the 1968 Games; no athlete has ever won any medals. The 2010 delegation consisted of two athletes competing in alpine skiing, Adam Lamhamedi and Kenza Tazi, who were accompanied by Adam's brother Sami and four officials. Adam Lamhamedi was also the nation's flag bearer in the Parade of Nations, and at the closing ceremony. Neither skier finished on a medal podium.\nBackground.\nMorocco participated in six Winter Olympics between its debut at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. By the 2014 Games, no Moroccan athlete had ever won a medal at a Winter Games, excluding the Youth Games.\nAccording to the final quota allocation released on 20 January 2014, Morocco had two athletes in qualification position. Mustapha Nait Lhou, the president of the Moroccan Ski Association, said that this made Morocco \"the most represented among African Arab nations.\" Adam Lamhamedi was the sole male athlete in the Moroccan delegation at the 2014 Winter Games. Lamhamedi was seventeen at the time of the Sochi Games, having been eligible to represent the country through his Moroccan father. Lamhamedi had represented the country at the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012, held in Innsbruck, Austria.\nAt those Games, Lamhamedi won the gold medal in the boy's super-G competition. At the time, he said \"I wanted to prove that Moroccans can ski well, and I proved it. This represents that in life you can do everything, never give up.\" This achievement meant that he was the first African competitor to win a medal of any colour at a Winter Olympics event. During the ski season prior to the Sochi Games, Lamhamedi qualified to compete at the Olympics by receiving the required number of points.\nBoston born Kenza Tazi was the sole female athlete competing for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She had skied from the age of three onwards, and said her hero was American skier Bode Miller. At the time of the start of the 2014 Games, she was also 17; she celebrated her 18th birthday while in Sochi. She chose to represent Morocco over the United States as the Moroccan Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third skier, Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute. These athletes were also accompanied by four officials.\nAlpine skiing.\nAdam Lamhamedi acted as Morocco's flag bearer in the Parade of Nations and at the closing ceremony. He played down his medal chances, saying \"The best guys are between 26 and 36 years old, I'm 18, any skier's dream is to go to the Olympics and ski with the best. You learn a lot from these experiences; Morocco, this is not a country where people expect medals at the Winter Games. Just to represent an African country in skiing is something.\"\nLamhamedi competed in the men's giant slalom on 19 February. In his first run, he finished in 51st position with a time of one minute and 29.27 seconds. This second run was slightly slower, but his position increased to 48th in a time of one minute and 29.96 seconds. This gave him an overall position of 47th (two minutes and 29.23 seconds), just ahead of Alexandru Barbu from Romania (two minutes and 29.24 seconds) but immediately behind Armenia's Arman-Ted Serebrakian. The event was won by Ted Ligety of the United States in a time of two minutes and 45.29 seconds.\nLamhamedi also competed in the slalom on 22 February. In his first run, he finished in 51st position with a time of 54.47 seconds, directly behind Adam Barwood from New Zealand (54.21 seconds) and ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Igor Laikert (54.68 seconds). However, Lamhamedi failed to complete his second run, and so ended the slalom competition without a final position.\nKenza Tazi admitted that she was not expecting to win medals, saying \"I'll try to enjoy myself. I have not the art, nor the experience to win a medal at this major sporting event, so I fear things differently. I'm here primarily to ski and to better improve my abilities.\" She competed in the women's giant slalom on 18 February. In her first run, she finished in 69th place with a time of one minute and 35.27 seconds. Her second run and placement was improved; joint 61st place with a time of one minute and 34.52 seconds. This gave her the overall position of 62nd in a combined time of three minutes and 9.79 seconds, just ahead of Turkish skier Tuğba Daşdemir Kocaağa (three minutes and 9.8 seconds), but behind Triin Tobi from Estonia (three minutes and 9.17 seconds). The gold medallist was Slovenia's Tina Maze with an overall time of two minutes and 36.87 seconds.\nTazi also competed in the slalom on 21 February. After her first run of the day, in one minute and 10.19 seconds, she was in 56th place. She recorded an improved time of one minute and 6.96 seconds, placing her in 45th place for the second run. This meant her overall time of two minutes and 17.15 seconds placed her in 45th position, just ahead of Tobi (two minutes and 20.45 seconds) but behind Ivana Bulatović of Montenegro (two minutes and 12.8 seconds). Mikaela Shiffrin was the gold medallist in an overall time of one minute and 44.54 seconds."

The Luxembourgian team consisted of one athlete in cross-country skiing, Kari Peters. In the only event he contested, the men's sprint, he finished in 79th place. He withdrew from the 15 km classical due to illness.\nBackground.\nLuxembourg first joined Olympic competition at the 1900 Summer Olympics and first participated at the Winter Olympic Games at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Their participation at Winter Olympics since has been sporadic; Luxembourg did not send a delegation to any Winter Olympics from 1948 to 1984. They also skipped the 2002 and the 2010 Winter Olympics. This was Luxembourg's eighth appearance at a Winter Olympics. In their history, Luxembourg has won medals at both the Summer and Winter Olympics; their Winter Olympics medals, both silver, were won in 1992. According to the quota allocation released on 20 January 2014, Luxembourg had one athlete in qualification position for alpine skiing and one for cross-country skiing, however, no alpine skiers were selected for the final Luxembourgian team. The final Luxembourgian team consisted of one cross-country skier, Kari Peters.

Peters was the first ever athlete to qualify in cross-country skiing for the country. He was 28 years old at the time of the Sochi Olympics. On 11 February he took part in the men's sprint, posting a time of 4 minutes and 13.08 seconds. This time put him in 79th place out of 85 competitors who finished the race. Only the top 30 finishers were allowed to advance to the next round, and Peters was therefore eliminated; the slowest qualifying time was 3 minutes and 37.88 seconds. The gold medal was won by Ola Vigen Hattestad of Norway, silver was won by Teodor Peterson, and bronze by Emil Jönsson, both of Sweden. Peters was also scheduled to compete in the 15 kilometre classical event held on 14 February, but withdrew due to suffering from a severe cold.

        "text": "The 1967–68 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1967–68 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his second season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. It finished with a record of 11-12 and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nThe 1967–1968 season saw the beginning of an annual series between Georgetown and Holy Cross. It continued through the 1979–1980 season, after which the rivalry between the schools came to an end.\nOnly five lettermen returned from the previous seasons 12-11 team, none of them taller than tall. After a strong season on the freshman team, sophomore center Charlie Adrion joined them on the varsity this season. In mid-December 1968, Magee moved sophomore forward Paul Favorite to center and moved Adrion to forward. The switch was successful; at forward, Adrion excelled on both offense and defense. In the third game of the season, at Syracuse, he led the Hoyas in scoring for the first time with 18 points. He followed this up with 21 points and 19 rebounds against Loyola, 15 points and 13 rebounds against Rutgers, 18 points and 17 rebounds three days later against Xavier, and, in arguably the best performance by a Georgetown player in a single game, 30 points and 29 rebounds on February 22, 1968, against George Washington. He scored 20 or more points in six of the last eight games of the year and finished the season averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds a game.\nEight games into the season, senior guard and team co-captain Bruce Stinebrickner was shooting 63% from the field – among the top ten in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) – and he averaged 12.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game this year. He scored in double figures in 16 games, twice scored a career-high 23 points, and against New York University (NYU) had 16 points and 13 rebounds, a rebounding effort matched by only two other Georgetown guards. He finished the year shooting 51.7% from the field for his career – still the second highest for a Hoya guard – never having shot under 50% for a season.\nLike Adrion and Stinebrickner, senior guard and team co-captain Dennis Cesar, known for his free-throw-shooting prowess, got off to a hot start this season, leading the team in scoring in six of the first 10 games. His 25-point performance on December 6, 1967, against St. Joseph's at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the second game of the season, including shooting 9-for-9 from the free-throw line, led Georgetown to its first victory over the Hawks since 1956. The long-awaited win prompted about 250 Georgetown students to meet the teams bus for an impromptu celebration when it arrived at McDonough Gymnasium at 2:45 a.m. after the drive back to campus.\nJunior forward Jim Supple scored in double figures in 16 games, including the last seven games of the season. Among the latter were 20-plus-point performances against NYU and Fairleigh Dickinson.\nThe 1967-1968 Hoyas were the first Georgetown team to play at the new Madison Square Garden, meeting Manhattan there on February 15, 1968, four days after the new arena opened.\nThe 1967–1968 team played inconsistently all season, finishing with a record of 11-12 – the first losing record by a Georgetown men's basketball team since the 1959-60 season – and had no post-season play. It was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through this season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home. (The following season, this practice was discontinued, and players wore the same number at home and on the road.)\nSource\n1967–68 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1966–67 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1966–67 NCAA University Division college basketball season. John Magee coached them in his first season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C.\nAfter the departure of Georgetown head coach Tommy O'Keefe at the end of the previous season, no college head coach or assistant coach applied for the job. Boston College head coach Bob Cousy recommended Magee, the head coach of Catholic Memorial School in Boston, Massachusetts. Georgetown hired Magee, who would go on to coach the Hoyas for six seasons.\nSeason recap.\nJunior guard Dennis Cesar, an expert in shooting free throws, shot 12-for-16 from the field at Canisius. In the two games of the Kodak Classic in late December 1966, he scored a combined 40 points against Purdue and Dartmouth. Shortly after that, he had a 28-point game against Saint Peter's. A shoulder injury reduced his performance later in the year but did not stop him from scoring in double figures in all but two games this season.\nSenior forward Steve Sullivan played in all 23 games and scored in double figures in 21 of them, scoring 20 or more points ten times. In the season opener, he scored 33 points and pulled down 17 rebounds against American; later in the year he had 26 points and 23 rebounds against Syracuse, and in the last home game of the year, he had an 18-point, 16-rebound effort against Seton Hall. For the season, he averaged 12 rebounds per game, a school record at the time.\nSenior center Frank Hollendoner frequently got into foul trouble, but he shot 69% from the field and averaged 11.1 points per game for the season. He scored 22 points against Purdue and scored 15 points and had 15 rebounds against Navy.\nSophomore forward Jim Supple joined the varsity team after a high-scoring season with the freshman team the previous year. He played in all 23 games and, although he often got in foul trouble, he scored in double figures in 15 of them. His season high was a 23-point performance against Boston College.\nIn the 1964-65 season, Georgetown had started strong, raising hopes for a post-season tournament berth, but lost seven of its final 10 games to drop out of consideration for the post-season. Two years later, the 1966-67 Hoyas followed a similar pattern, starting 9-3 but losing eight of their final 11 games to finish with a record of 12-11 and no post-season play. The team was not ranked in the Top 20 of the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time.\nRoster.\nFrom the 1958-59 season through the 1967-68 season, Georgetown players wore even-numbered jerseys for home games and odd-numbered ones for away games; for example, a player would wear No. 10 at home and No. 11 on the road. Players are listed below by the even numbers they wore at home.\nGuard Bernard White joined the team this season as the first African-American recruit in Georgetown men's basketball history. He had played for George Mason University the previous season, but George Mason's men's basketball program did not receive National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recognition until 1967, so White retained the then-maximum three years of NCAA varsity eligibility when he joined the Hoyas.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll at any time.\n1966–67 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "title": "All-time tennis records – Men's singles",
        "text": "This article covers the period from 1877 to present. Before the beginning of the Open Era in April 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in established tennis tournaments, including the four Grand Slam tournaments (also known as the majors). Wimbledon, the oldest of the majors, was founded in 1877, followed by the US Open in 1881, the French Open in 1891 and the Australian Open in 1905. Beginning in 1905 and continuing to the present day, all four majors have been played yearly, with the exception of during the two World Wars, 1986 for the Australian Open, and 2020 for Wimbledon. The Australian Open is the first major of the year (January), followed by the French Open (May–June), Wimbledon (June–July) and the US Open (August–September). There was no prize money and players were compensated for travel expenses only. A player who wins all four majors, in singles or as part of a doubles team, in the same calendar year is said to have achieved a \"Grand Slam\". If the player wins all four consecutively, but not in the same calendar year, it is called a \"Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam\". Winning all four at some point in a career, even if not consecutively, is referred to as a \"Career Grand Slam\". Winning the four majors and a gold medal in tennis at the Summer Olympics in the same calendar year has been called a \"Golden Slam\" since 1988. Winning all four majors plus an Olympic gold at some point in a career, even if not consecutively, is referred to as a \"Career Golden Slam\". Winning the year-end championship while also having won a Golden Slam is referred to as a \"Super Slam\". Winning all four majors, an Olympic gold, and the year-end championships at some point in a career, even if not consecutively, is referred to as a \"Career Super Slam\". Winning the four majors in all three disciplines a player is eligible for–singles, doubles and mixed doubles–is considered winning a \"boxed set\" of Grand Slam titles.\nPrior to 1924, the major tennis championships, governed by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), were the World Hard Court Championships, World Grass Court Championships (Wimbledon), and World Covered Court Championships.\nMany top tennis players turned professional before the Open Era to play legally for prize money. They played in separate professional events and were banned from competing any of the four Grand Slam tournaments. They mostly competed on pro tours involving head-to-head competition, but also in professional tournaments as the biggest events on the pro tour. In addition to the head-to-head tours, there were the annual professional tournaments called \"Championship tournaments\" (known retrospectively as \"professional majors\" or \"professional Grand Slams\" where the world's top professional players usually played. These tournaments held a certain tradition and longevity.\nThe oldest of these three professional majors, was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played at a variety of different venues and on a variety of different surfaces, between 1925 and 1999, although it was no longer a major after 1967. Between 1954 and 1962, the U.S. Pro was played indoors in Cleveland and was billed as the World Professional Championships. The most prestigious of the three was generally the Wembley Championships. Played between 1934 and 1990, at the Wembley Arena in England, it was unofficially usually considered the world's championship until 1967. The third professional major was the French Pro Championship, played between 1934 and 1968, on the clay courts of Roland Garros, apart from 1963 to 1967, when it was played on the indoor wood courts of Stade Coubertin.\nThe Open Era of tennis began in 1968, when the Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs. A professional tennis tour was created for the entire year, where everyone could compete. This meant that the division that had existed for many years between these two groups had finally come to an end, which made the tennis world into one unified competition.\nThe first tournament to go \"Open\" started on 22 April 1968 was the British Hard Court Championships at The West Hants Club in Bournemouth, England. The first Grand Slam tournament to do so was the 1968 French Open, starting on 27 May.\nAnalysis of records.\nToday, the ultimate pursuit in tennis is to win the Grand Slam; winning all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year. In 1982, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) broadened the definition of the Grand Slam as meaning any four straight major victories, including the ones spanning two calendar years that became known as the non-calendar year Grand Slam, though it later reversed its definition.\nIn the history of men's tennis, only two players have won the calendar Grand Slam, Don Budge (1938) and Rod Laver (1962 and 1969). Budge remains the sole player to have won six majors in a row (1937–1938). In the Open Era, only one player has achieved the non-calendar year Grand Slam, Novak Djokovic (2015–2016). This is followed by a career Grand Slam, a feat achieved by a player winning each of the majors during their career, which eight players have done. Winning just one of these major tournaments in a year is a sought-after achievement but winning all four or more consecutively, if we apply \"Prochnow's (2018)\" analysis retrospectively in Budge's case, transforms a player into a legend.\nWhen we reflect on the modern era of the sport, tennis has clear separations during its history, such as the first official majors sanctioned by the world governing body of tennis its separate tours (amateur and professional), the eligibility to compete at Grand Slam majors or the surface aspects of the tournaments. In 1913, the ILTF created its first tennis majors, three world championship tournaments that were abolished by 1923. In the history of those early majors, only one player won all three in the same year, Anthony Wilding, arguably the first world champion. In 1927, the men's game was separated, leading to the creation of what are now referred to as the pro majors. During a period of 40 years, only two players achieved the calendar Pro Grand Slam in the history of the professional tour, Ken Rosewall (1963) and Laver (1967). Prior to 1968, only amateurs could enter the Grand Slam tournaments. This was changed in 1968, after which both professionals and amateurs could compete for the tennis majors.\nThere are also several other facets to take into consideration in defining great tennis players, such as winning all calendar year majors consecutively on offer at the time (World Champs and Pro Slams) on three different surfaces. Three players achieved this distinction between 1913 and 1967, Wilding, Rosewall and Laver. Only those same three players did so not only by surface, but also different environments (indoors and outdoors). When the professional majors were abolished in 1967, the Grand Slam majors were still only being played on two exclusive surfaces, grass and clay. In 1978, the US Open switched surface to a hardcourt thus re-creating a third unique surface. This is arguably the best date in defining the beginning of the modern era of tennis. In this new modern era, only one player (Djokovic) has won all four majors in a row. Only two players have achieved the new term, a \"Surface Slam\", winning three consecutive majors on three distinct surfaces, that being Rafael Nadal in 2010 and Novak Djokovic in 2021. To have accomplished any of these feats in a group of tournaments originating over 100 years ago underscores the degree of difficulty involved.\nThese are some of the important records since the start of the first Grand Slam tournament held at the Wimbledon Championships.

        "text": "The 1976–77 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1976–77 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his fifth season as head coach. An independent, Georgetown played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 19-9. Knocked out of the ECAC South Region tournament for the first time in the semifinals, the team missed an NCAA tournament bid for the first time since 1974. The Hoyas instead appeared in the 1977 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), their first NIT appearance since 1970, and lost in the first round to Virginia Tech.\nSeason recap.\nJunior guard and perennial high scorer Derrick Jackson shot 198-for-404 (49.0%) from the field during the season and scored 400 points, virtually duplicating his performance from the previous season, when he had shot 195-for-399 (48.9%) from the field and scored 406 points. This season, he scored in double figures in 27 of 28 games and finished first in five scoring categories for the team.\nPromising freshman forward Craig \"Big Sky\" Shelton missed all but seven games because of a knee injury and would not emerge as one of the teams stars until the following season. His high school teammate, freshman guard John Duren, however, became a starter by mid-season and showed his talent as a point guard and shooter. His ability to lead the team as point guard and pass the ball contributed to Georgetowns team shooting percentage rising from 46% to 50% during the year. He scored a season-high 19 points against Boston College and averaged 15 points per game after becoming a starter.\nWith the arrival of Duren, there was little need for sophomore Steve Martin to play as a guard – his position in high school and during his freshman year – so Thompson played him off the bench as a small forward this season. Martin made the most of the transition, scoring 15 against Purdue, 17 against Pennsylvania, and a season-high 20 against Seton Hall. He also came off the bench for an eight-point, six-steal game against Holy Cross.\nAlthough retaining its status as an independent, Georgetown was in its third season as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), a loosely organized sports federation that held three regional post-season Division I basketball tournaments in 1977 for independent Eastern colleges and universities similar to the end-of-season conference tournaments held by conventional college basketball conferences, with each tournament winner receiving an at-large bid to the 1977 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Hoyas participated in the ECAC South Region tournament, which they had won in 1975 and 1976, facing Old Dominion in the semifinal. Junior Georgetown center Ed Hopkins, a key defensive presence also making a major offensive contribution by averaging 10.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game and leading the team in shooting percentage from the field at 57%, missed the game because of an ankle injury. The Hoyas struggled without Hopkins and lost to Old Dominion 80-58. They therefore missed an NCAA tournament berth for the first time since the 1973-74 season.\nInvited to the 1977 National Invitation Tournament instead, the Hoyas faced Virginia Tech in the first round. Sophomore forward Al Dutch, averaging 13.3 points and 7.8 rebounds per game for the season, had to sit out the game with an ankle injury. Georgetown missed Dutchs scoring and lost to the Hokies 83-79 despite Derrick Jacksons 28-point performance, which tied his career-high 28 points scored against Penn State during the 1975-76 season. Senior forward Larry Long, often limited by injuries during his four years with the Hoyas, put in an impressive performance in the last two collegiate games of his career with a combined 28 rebounds in the Old Dominion and Virginia Tech games.\nRoster.\nJunior guard Craig Esherick would later serve as an assistant coach for the Hoyas from 1982 to 1999 and as head coach from 1999 to 2004. Junior guard Mike Riley would later serve as a Hoya assistant coach from 1982 to 2004.\nSource\nRankings.\nSources\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 20 of the Associated Press Poll at any time, but it was ranked in the Top 20 in the Coaches' Poll during two weeks.

John Thompson, coached them in his second season as head coach. The team was an independent and played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. A young and inexperienced team, it played inconsistently, finished the season with a record of 13-13, and had no post-season play.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore center Merlin Wilson had posted scoring and rebounding statistics unprecedented in Georgetown basketball history during his freshman year, drawing national attention. Opponents paid extra attention to defending against him this season, and foul trouble limited his performance in the early games. Thompson moved him to power forward in January 1974, and this allowed him to return to form, with 23 points and 16 rebounds against Chicago State and 23 rebounds each in games a week apart against Holy Cross and Penn State. He averaged 15.5 rebounds per game for the season, a school record still well beyond the average posted by any other Hoya.\nSophomore guard Jonathan Smith led the team in scoring this season, finishing with 466 points, the third-highest total in a single season for a Georgetown player. He scored 20 or more points numerous times, averaged 25 points per game in the latter part of the season, and scored a season-high 32 points against Connecticut on February 16, 1974.\nSophomore forward Bill Lynn had seen little action as a reserve the previous season, but a back injury to forward Mark Gallagher that ended Gallaghers Georgetown career gave Lynn more playing time this year. He finished the season second on the team in both scoring and rebounding with an average of 13 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, including 20 points and nine rebounds against 2nd-ranked Notre Dame and 28 points and 18 rebounds against Boston College.\nFreshman forward Larry Long scored a career-high 25 points against Boston College and finished the year averaging 7.1 points per game. He started every game, but an injury he suffered at St. Joseph's was the beginning of many injuries that would hamper him for the rest of his collegiate career.\nThe 1973-74 squad was not ranked in the Top 20 in the Associated Press Poll or Coaches' Poll at any time. It was the last Georgetown men's basketball team to finish a season without a winning record until the 1998–99 season. It also was the last one to have no post-season play in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament or the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) until the 2001-02 team declined an invitation to the 2002 NIT, and the last one to receive no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT until the 2003-04 season.\nRoster.\nSource\n1973–74 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1979–80 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1978–79 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his eighth season as head coach. It was the Hoyas first season as members of the original Big East Conference, which began play this season; prior to this year, Georgetown had been an independent during the 38 seasons it had fielded a team since the dissolution of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference at the end of the 1938-39 season. Georgetown would remain a member of the original Big East for 34 seasons, through the end of the 2012–13 season. The teams penchant for playing tight games decided in the last seconds led to it being nicknamed the Heart Attack Hoyas.\nGeorgetown played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 26-6 overall, 5-1 in Big East Conference play. A regular season Big East co-champion, Georgetown also won the Big East tournament championship. In the 1980 NCAA tournament, the Hoyas advanced to the East Region final before losing to Iowa.\nSeason recap.\nSenior forward Craig \"Big Sky\" Shelton had a very strong season. During non-conference games, he shot 10-for-10 from the field against No. 1 Indiana, scored 22 points and shot 10-for-10 from the free-throw line against Houston, had 22 points against Northeastern, scored 20 points and had 10 rebounds against Boston College in the ECAC Holiday Festival, and scored 23 against United States International, 21 against Detroit, and 22 against Holy Cross. At one point he scored on 21 consecutive shots from the field over the course of four games. When Big East Conference play began against Providence, he put in an 18-point performance, and he scored in double figures in every conference game.\nSophomore guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd had led the team in scoring the previous season, and he continued to do so this season. He had 16 points against United States International, 23 against American, 24 against Boston College, 30 against Wagner, 22 against Detroit, 30 against George Washington, and 21 against Holy Cross. Sophomore center Ed Spriggs, meanwhile, had a 14-point, 10-rebound performance against Maryland; after an ankle injury in the game against Oral Roberts slowed Spriggs, reserve Mike Hancock started at center successfully in the remaining 18 games of the year. Forward Al Dutch, who had taken the previous season off for personal reasons, returned for his senior year and averaged 5.9 points per game but had an unusual streak in the middle of the season in which he scored 12 points each in five straight games.\nOne early game took on a significance that only became apparent in retrospect. Georgetown and Maryland had begun play against one another in 1907 and had played each other in the regular season once or twice annually in 42 of the 46 seasons since 1935. During the December 5 game between the Hoyas and the Terrapins, John Thompson and Maryland head coach Lefty Driesell got into a shouting match at midcourt. The incident apparently soured relations between the schools, which did not schedule one another for a non-tournament regular-season game again until a single meeting in 1993, and then not again until a single game in 2015.\nThe season saw more than its share of memorable games. Georgetown won seven games by five or fewer points, and four of its six losses came in the final seconds or in overtime, leading the team to become known as the \"Heart Attack Hoyas\" because of the nervous stress they supposedly caused their fans. At Boston College in a Big East game on January 30, 1980, for example, the Hoyas faced an eight-point deficit with 1:09 left in the game; in the pre-shot-clock, pre-three-point-shot era, a comeback from that far back with so little time left was especially difficult. Georgetown scored on a layup, stole the ball and scored on another layup, and then freshman guard Eric Smith, who shot 9-for-10 from the free-throw line during the game, sank two free throws after a Boston College offensive foul to narrow Boston Colleges lead to two. The Eagles then made one of two free throws of their own to extend their lead to three, but fouled Georgetown center Mike Frazier as he scored with one second left; Frazier then sank his free throw to tie the game and force overtime. Even though four Hoyas had fouled out by the end of overtime, Georgetown pulled out a 97-92 victory before a national ESPN television audience.\nOn February 13, 1980, Georgetown visited No.3-ranked Syracuse for the last game Syracuse was to play at Manley Field House before moving into the new Carrier Dome for its home games. The odds-on favorite with a 57-game home winning streak at Manley, Syracuse expected to virtually clinch the first Big East regular-season championship by closing Manley with one final victory, and held a 14-point lead over the Hoyas at halftime. Shelton scored 17 points and, late in the game, the Hoyas went on a 15-5 run to tie the score at 50. With five seconds left, Syracuse fouled Sleepy Floyd, and Floyd, who uncharacteristically scored only eight points in the game, sank both his free throws to give Georgetown a 52-50 upset win. In his post-game press conference, John Thompson exulted, \"Manley Field House is officially closed.\" That quote, combined with Georgetown's upset victory on an historic evening in Syracuse basketball, is credited as the beginning of the great Georgetown-Syracuse rivalry that would be one of the defining features of the original Big East Conference for the rest of its 34-year existence.\nThe Hoyas finished the season with a record of 5-1 in Big East play, giving them a share of the conferences first regular-season championship along with St. John's and Syracuse. In the first Big East tournament, they defeated Syracuse in the final – with Eric Smith playing a fine defensive game and scoring a season-high 17 points and Ed Spriggs putting in a 13-point, 10-rebound performance – to win the first conference tournament championship. Floyd scored 22 points in the quarterfinal against Seton Hall, 20 in the semifinal against St. John's, and 21 against Syracuse. Shelton averaged 16 points per game during the tournament.\nThe Hoyas were the No. 3 seed in the East Region of the 1980 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the second of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. They received a first-round bye, but the seed nonetheless was a disappointment to the Hoyas as it placed them behind Maryland, which they had defeated during the regular season, and Syracuse, which they had defeated twice in the preceding three weeks. In the second round, they faced an Iona team coached by Jim Valvano and led by center and power forward Jeff Ruland which between the regular season and its championship-winning run in the 1980 ECAC Metro Region tournament had compiled a 29-4 record. The Hoyas held Ruland to 16 points and seven rebounds, but Ionas Alex Middleton had perhaps the best game of his career, scoring 18 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. Craig Shelton, however, scored 27 points, and Al Dutch scored a season-high 16, and the Hoyas narrowly avoided an upset, advancing with a 74-71 win. They thus became only the second Georgetown men's basketball team in history to win a game in an NCAA tournament and the first to do so since the 1942-43 team advanced to the final game of the 1943 NCAA tournament.\nGeorgetown upset No. 8-ranked Maryland in the East Region semifinal in an emotional game; Shelton got in foul trouble and was limited to seven points, but Eric Smiths defense held Marylands Albert King to a 6-for-18 shooting performance. Advancing to the regional final, the Hoyas next faced the East Regions No. 5 seed, Iowa. Against Iowa, Georgetown led by 10 points at halftime and extended its lead to 14 in the second half, during which it shot 68.2% from the floor, with Sleepy Floyd scoring a game-high – and career-high – 31 points and Shelton scoring 16 points. But Iowa shot 17-for-21 (81%) in field goal attempts and a perfect 15-for-15 in free throws and closed the gap. With seven seconds left in the game and the Hoyas leading 80-79, Shelton was called for a foul against Iowas Steve Waite; Waite scored both his free throws to give the Hawkeyes an 81-80 upset victory and bring the Heart Attack Hoyas season to an end with one final last-second decision.\nDuring Georgetowns three NCAA Tournament games, Sleepy Floyd shot 58 percent from the field, 86 percent from the free throw line, and scored 70 points. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the NCAA Tournament East Regional, and finished the season as the top scorer for Georgetown for the second season in a row. Eric Smith shot 55 percent from the field for the season. Shelton finished his collegiate career as the third-highest-scoring player in Georgetown history despite having played in only seven games in his freshman year. In his final college season, senior point guard John Duren had averaged 12.3 points and 7.1 assists per game, and his 228 assists during the season surpassed the previous Georgetown record by a wide margin; he also played a school-record 1,164 minutes during the year without ever fouling out, and his leadership of the team on the floor at point guard contributed to the Hoyas shooting a Georgetown-record 53% from the field during the season.\nThe 1979–1980 season saw the end of the annual series between Georgetown and Holy Cross, which had begun in the 1967–1968 season, and the end of the rivalry between the schools.\nThe 1979-1980 Hoyas were ranked No. 11 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and No. 10 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1979–80 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Horse racing in the Philippines",
        "text": "Horseracing in the Philippines began as a recreational activity in 1867. Its history is divided into three major time periods based on the breed of horses raced, in conjunction with the three significant eras of Philippine history. According to the type of horses used, the periods are the Philippine-pony era (1867–1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898–1930), and the Thoroughbred era (1935–present).\nThe Philippine-pony era refers to the time when the Philippines was under Spanish control. At that time, racehorses were bred from the German, Persian, and Israeli lineages of the Classical period in Philippine history, 900–1521.\nThe Arabian-horse refers to the time when the \"American Philippines\" were a territory of the United States, 1898–1946, although the Arabian-horse era only lasted until 1935.\nThe Thoroughbred-era (1935–present) replaced the breeding of Arabian for horseracing with local breeds; the era continued when the Philippines became an independent republic in 1946.\nSpanish era (1521–1898).\nPhilippine-pony era (1867–1898).\nStraight-way course.\nThe earliest record of horseracing in the Philippines was in 1867. At that time a straight flat course measuring was used. From 1867 to approximately 1881, the common breed of horses used were those whose lineage were of Suluan, Indian, and Chinese stock. Also in 1867, the Manila Jockey Club (MJC) was founded by Philippine Governor-General José de la Gandara y Navarro, a Spaniard, together with the club's founding members (the , literally meaning \"founding partners\"). The MJC was the first racing club established in Southeast Asia, with 100 founding partners from the \"prominent and affluent families\" of the time period, including Spaniards, Filipinos, and English. These families include the Ayalas, the Zobels, the Tuasons, the Elizaldes, the Bousteads, and the Prietos. Edward Boustead was the father of Nellie Boustead, a French woman courted by two Philippine revolutionary heroes, namely José Rizal and Antonio Luna: in Paris, they nearly came to a duel over her.\nBecause the MJC was established as a social and recreation club, from 1867 through the 1870s only \"fun runs\" without betting were held annually, during April or May. The straight course ran from the Basilica of San Sebastian, Manila up to the Quiapo Church. The jockeys for the (\"official races\") were exclusive to club members. The prizes for the winning jockeys included a gold medal, a silver medal, and an ornamental watch.\nEnglish-style oval horseracing.\nEnglish-style horseracing was first used in the Philippines from 1881, being held twice yearly for four consecutive days. The event was supported by Governor-General Eulogio Despujol. The location was moved in 1881 from the MJC in Quiapo, Manila to the oval of the (Santa Mesa Hippodrome) in the district of Santa Mesa, also in Spanish Manila, next to the Pasig River; by 1880 Quiapo had become crammed with shops and businessmen's residences. The new location was a ricefield rented by the club from the Tuasons, a family club member. The grandstand next to the new oval track was made of nipa and bamboo. Back then, horseraces in the oval track ran clockwise, like in England, but nowadays they run counter-clockwise, like in the United States.\nThe horseracing activities of the MJC were suspended during the 1896 Philippine Revolution, a conflict between Spanish soldiers and Filipino revolutionaries. They resumed after the ratification of the 1897 Pact of Biak-na-Bato. The truce was celebrated in Manila with a fiesta in Manila for the entire month of January 1898. The MJC intended to celebrate the truce by holding a race known as the (\"Grand Manila Cup\") in May 1898. The prize trophy for the winning horse rider would have been a silver cup made in Hong Kong, embellished with horses' heads and a likeness of Justitia, the goddess of justice. But it was not to be, because in 1898 horseracing in the Philippines was suspended with the onset of the Spanish–American War, that lasted from April 25 until August 12, 1898. The Gran Copa trophy was sent by the MJC to the Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong for safekeeping, and was only returned in 1937, after 38 years.\nAmerican era (1898–1946).\nAfter the Spanish–American War, the Philippines became a territory of the United States, because Spain opted to make peace with the United States. resulting in the 1898 Treaty of Paris (1898), where Spain negotiated on terms favorable to the US, allowing temporary American control of Cuba, and ceding indefinite colonial authority over Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippine islands – as island possessions – to the US.\nArabian-horse era (1898–1955).\nHorseracing at the Santa Mesa Hippodrome (also known as the Santa Mesa Oval) resumed in the Philippines in 1899. In 1900, the MJC was moved to San Lazaro in the district of Santa Cruz, Tayuman in Manila (the MJC is currently known as the San Lazaro Leisure &amp; Business Park). The site measured and had a grandstand and a 1200-meter or six-furlong track. In 1901, during the term of American Governor-General William Howard Taft, the \"democratization of horseracing\" allowed \"people from all social strata\" to go to the hippodrome during horseracing days. Betting was introduced and permitted in 1903. In 1930, foreign breeds such as Arabian horses were imported by the Bureau of Agriculture. Also in 1930, the Bureau of Animal Industry was established, and continued to import Arabian horses.\nDuring this time, there were two other racetracks that tried to compete with the MJC: the Pasay Country Club (between Harrison Street and Vito Cruz Street) and another in Cebu. Neither lasted long.\nThoroughbred-era (1935–present) started.\nIn 1935, the Philippine Legislature signed Act No. 4130 This law authorized the holding of Sweepstakes Races by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, which replaced the National Charity Sweepstakes on October 30, 1934. The MJC became incorporated in 1937, becoming the Manila Jockey Club, Inc. (MJCI), transforming itself from a social association into a business.\nIn 1937, the Philippine Racing Club was established in Makati and became a competitor to the MJCI. Established by Filipino and American businessmen, the Philippine Racing Club (PRC) was also organized for the purpose of using horse breeds of \"superior quality\" for horseracing. In 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 156 was enforced. This Commonwealth Act was later amended through Commonwealth Act No. 156. The purpose of Commonwealth Act No. 156 was to include the Philippine Tuberculosis Society Inc. in the holding of yearly National Grand Derby Races, with the goal of promoting the breeding of local or native horses in the Philippines.\nAt the beginning of the 1940s, when Rafael Roces became the president of MJCI, he introduced two types of bet on the horseracing menu: the \"daily double\" bet and the (\"key\") bet. The daily double bet is unique to the Philippines, and is not offered in other countries. The daily double bet is still popular today.\nWhile under American possession, the Philippines became involved in World War II (1939–1945). Although the war began in 1939, it only started to affect the Philippines directly in 1941 when the United States entered. MJCI had to close for the duration of the war. From 1941, the Gran Copa trophy of the MJCI was kept by Dr. Salustiano Herrera, an officer of the club. The invading Japanese armed forces used the premises of the MJCI as their barracks. After World War II, the MJCI's buildings were converted by the Americans into a facility with \"a hospital and a garrison\".\nHerrera returned the Gran Copa trophy to MJCI and it was installed in the Trophy Room.\nIndependent-Republics era (1946–present).\nAfter the Second World War, the Republic of the Philippines was officially recognized as an independent nation on July 4, 1946.\nThoroughbred-era (1935–present) continued.\n1940s.\nIn March 1946, the horseracing facilities of MJCI were returned to its members. It took two months of reconstruction before the racetrack became open to the public. In 1948, the Commission on Races was created by Republic Act. No. 309, a law signed by former Philippine President Elpidio Quirino to regulate horseracing.\n1950s.\nIn 1951, President Quirino further signed Executive Order No. 392, a presidential order that resulted in the creation of the Games and Amusements Board, which was given the responsibility to regulate public gaming. The Board was also tasked with enforcing gambling laws.\nIn 1957, after the MJCI was registered at the Manila Stock Exchange, off-track betting stations were established in Manila, Pampanga, Cavite, and other provinces with the aim of eradicating illegal bookmakers. Horseraces at the club were broadcast on television via VHF Channel 11.\n1960s.\nIn 1964, the Philippines became the host of the Fourth Asian Racing Conference. In 1965, the National Stud Farm was created, through former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos's approval of Republic Act No. 4618. There were three main purposes for the National Stud Farm. First was to prevent the illegal importation of foreign breeds of horses. Second was to improve the existing breeds of Philippine horses. Third was to perform other functions related to horseracing. In 1969, regulation of the \"distribution of gross wages sales on horseracing\" was started through the approval of Republic Act No. 6115. During the 1960s, the Philippines became a member of the Asian Racing Conference (ARC), which focused on how further to improve horseracing in the region.\n1970s.\nIn 1971, the MJC's Gran Copa trophy was lost in a fire. Today only a replica exists at the San Lazaro Leisure Park (SLLP). Despite of the loss, the Gran Copa de Manila horseracing event continued during the 1970s. With San Miguel Beer as the sponsor, two divisions of the Gran Copa de Manila were being held. The event also became known as the San Miguel Beer Copa or SMB Copa due to SMB sponsorship.\nIn 1972, both the MJCI and the PRC were given franchises to \"construct, operate and maintain their own racetracks for a period of 25 years\". This was made into law by the Philippine Congress with Republic Acts No. 6631 and 6632.\nIn 1974, the twelfth Asian Racing Conference was held in the Philippines. Also during 1974, the Philippine Racing Commission (PHILRACOM) was created through Presidential Decree No. 420. PHILRACOM was given the responsibility to promote and administer the development of horseracing in the Philippines as \"a sport and a source of revenue and employment\". The PHILRACOM was established through the efforts of the Metropolitan Association of Race Horse Owners (MARHO), an organization formed when a shortage in the supply of horsefeed, such as oats, occurred. On March 20, 1974, the two entities sharing authority over horseracing were the Philippine Racing Commission and the Games and Amusements Board (GAB).\nAs of June 3, 1977, through Presidential Decree No. 1157, the rate of taxes from horseracing (together with Jai-alai) was equivalent to 10% of an individual's Sweepstakes winnings or dividends corresponding to each winning ticket, after deducting the cost of the ticket.\n1980s.\nIn 1988, Executive Order No. 194 reduced the level of horseracing taxes. This lowering of tax rates happened through the efforts of MARHO, which was headed at the time by Federico \"Eric\" Moreno, a Philippine justice.\n1990s.\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, computer technology was employed for the day-to-day operations of the MJCI.\nIn 1992, a program to monitor Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) was initiated by the National Stud Farm for all breeding stock. The tests adopted were the Coggins Test (also known as the Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion (AGID) Test). In 1995, the Blood Typing and Parentage Validation Program was also adopted by the NSF for horses that were under contract with the Royal Western India Turf Club, Inc. (RWITC). In 1996, the \"Stud Book Authority of the Philippines\" (SBAP, also known as \"The Philippine Stud Book Volume I\") was recognized by the International Stud Book Committee (ISBC). The \"Stud Book Authority of the Philippines\" recorded the \"breeding activities of more than 500 Thoroughbred mares\" (including those that were breeding in the Philippines) from 1994.\nIn 1996, the yearly MARHO Breeders Cup (MBC) program was established by MARHO leader, horseowner, and horsebreeder Aristeo \"Putch\" Puyat, together with Leonardo \"Sandy\" Javier, Jr., Puyat co-leader at MARHO. The program gives recognition and trophies to deserving horse owners, horse breeders, jockeys, and trainers, focused only on \"high-quality stock\" of Philippine-bred horses.\nIn November and December 1997 an outbreak of equine influenza affected horseracing in the Philippines.\nIn 1999, the second volume of the \"Stud Book Authority of the Philippines\" known as \"The Philippine Stud Book Volume II\" was published, a record of the \"breeding activities of more than 600 Thoroughbred mares\" in the country from 1995 through 1998, including stallions which have produced offspring from pregnant (in-foal) mares imported into the Philippines during that time.\nLive horseraces at the MJCI were later broadcast on a dedicated cable television channel.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Executive Order No. 296 was signed by Philippine President Joseph Estrada to integrate the \"personnel, programs and resources\" of the National Stud Farm with other units and agencies managed by the Department of Agriculture. With this Order the Stud Book Division became the Stud Book and Animal Registry Division (SBARD), placing it under the control of the Bureau and Animal Industry (BAI). With the same Order, the Stud Book Division became the Stud Book Authority of the Philippines (SBAP).\nIn 2001, three Japanese-owned thoroughbred horses bred in the Philippines were exported to Japan, and were proven to be of horseracing quality \"at par\" with racehorses bred in other countries.\nIn 2003, the Philippine National Stud Book Division was transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Philippine Racing Commission, a bureau that was directly under the control of the Office of the President of the Philippines. The executive order was approved by Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Also in 2003, the offices and racetrack of the MJCI were transferred to Carmona, Cavite at the San Lazaro Leisure Park (SLLP), a complex.\nIn 2004, after the start of the transfer of personnel, programs, and other resources of the Stud Book Division to the Philippine Racing Commission, \"The Philippine Stud Book Volume III\" was published, recording the breeding activities of 676 Thoroughbred mares from 1999 until 2002. Also in 2004, the first MARHO Founders Cup (also known as the \"Pearl Stakes\") horseracing festival was started by the founders of MARHO to celebrate the organization's foundation.\nIn 2005, Benhur C. Abalos became the leader of MARHO. Abalos and other members of MARHO took legal and police action against the activities of illegal bookmakers. The campaign would continue through 2006. Also in 2005, monitoring and eradication program for Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) was made mandatory by PHILRACOM for all racehorses. Identification \"passports\" were also issued for all racehorses, including pedigrees, vaccination, laboratory test results, and other required information.\nAlso during 2005 the MJCI developed a website featuring horseraces, tips, and results. In 2006, MJCI became the first horse racing club in the Philippines to provide horse racing information through text messaging, a program known as the , with plans to introduce betting via text message.\nAlso in 2006, the Blood Typing and Parentage Validation Program for racehorses was replaced by a DNA technology program. A microchip numbering program was additionally adopted in 2007 for foals that were born in 2005. Also in 2006, because of the International Agreement on Breeding, Racing and Wagering (IABRW), the Philippines became a signatory to significant articles published by International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in relation to racehorse breeding. On December 8, 2006, the San Lazaro Leisure Park Turf Club of the MJCI became the first \"racino\" in Asia. The casino gaming area, named as the \"Casino Filipino at San Lazaro\", was on the top floor of the SLLP Turf Club.\nIn 2008, the offices and Santa Ana racetrack of PRCI were transferred from Makati to the newly built Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park in Naic, Cavite.\n2010s.\nIn February 2013, the Metro Manila Turf Club, Inc. (also known as Metro Turf or MMTCI) opened, being the third world-class horse racing facility in the country. It operates at Malvar, Batangas.\nUntil the end of 2012, races were conducted every other Tuesdays to Sundays. The race venues were alternatively shuttled between PRCI and MJCI. With the entry of MMTCI in 2013, the racing calendar has been divided among the three racetracks; racing days are alternating held so that only one track operates in each racing day.\nIn November 2018, MMTCI wrote Philracom that they were considering suspending operations for the first quarter of 2019, citing financial losses among other reasons. A group of concerned horse owners approached the club's management and offered to run the racetrack themselves. This group of 'white knights', which calls itself the \"New Management Board\", is headed by former Mandaluyong mayor Atty. Benjamin C. Abalos Jr. and Atty. Narciso O. Morales. They began operating MMTCI in January 2019, with their first race meet a success in terms of gross sales.\n2020s.\nAffected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines beginning 2020, horse racing soldiered on.\nOn August 2022, Manila Jockey Club and the San Lazaro Leisure Park officially shut down its 155-year-old horse racing operations with the last races under its banners in October, disclosing the two \"would focus on real estate ventures while leasing existing properties.\" The Philippine Racing Club-Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park also announced that \"it will drop its horseracing business in November as it focuses on real estate development\"\nBoth the PRCI and MJCI begun the transition period to new operators to continue the traditions they started. Beginning November, 2022, given these circumstances, Metro Manila Turf Club took on a de facto monopoly mode on horse races and race betting, pending the arrival of the new competitors operating in Cavite and Batangas, one of them being Hapi Jockey Club, Inc. of The Horsemen's Track, which is constructing a new race track in Padre Garcia, Batangas, giving the province two top quality tracks and breaking the long hold Metroturf had on the province. Manila Jockey Club leased its horse racing facilities in Carmona, Cavite to HJCI as it began operations that year. \nDuring the running of the fourth race at Metro Turf Club in Malvar, Batangas on January 10, 2024, 46-year-old jockey Francisco “Kiko” A. Tuazon's (of Barangay 331, Manila) left stirrup of his horse No. 5 named \"Wild Eagle\" owned by James Rabano suddenly broke, caused him to lose his footing, and fell on the race track at 6:48 p.m from his horse. Tuazon was trampled by his horse and another steed. Suffering from a concussion, he was taken to Daniel Mercado Medical Center in Tanauan, Batangas where he was declared dead by Dr. Benjamin Macatangay. Philippine Racing Commission chairman Aurelio “Reli” P. De Leon Aurelio de Leon paid tribute to the fallen jockey in a statement: \"The Commission, along with the entire horse racing community, deeply mourns the untimely passing of jockey Francisco 'Kiko' Tuazon. A revered and cherished figure in the sport, he left an indelible mark on the track and in our hearts.\" This incident was the first ever major death in the sport in years."

        "title": "Golf in the Philippines",
        "text": "History of Golf in the Philippines is the history of golf in the Philippines as a pastime play, as an amateur game, and as a professional sport. Golf was introduced to the Philippines more than a hundred years ago. From then onwards, the Philippines has produced its own notable \"corps of golf masters\" and players.\nBeginnings.\nThe game of golf was introduced to the Filipinos in Manila by the British employees working for the Manila Railway Company in 1886, when the Philippines was a colony of Spain. At first, British railway workers played on a three-way golf course that they built in the paddy fields located south of Intramuros, Manila. By 1901, when the Philippines was already a territory of the United States, a nine-hole golf course adjacent to the site of the railway station became available for golfers. The nine-hole golf course paved the way to the creation of the Manila Golf Club and later the founding of the game tournament in the Philippines as the Philippine Open in 1913.\nThe Philippine Open.\nThe Philippine Open (also known as the National Open ) was one of the oldest world competitions in the field of golf. It is also the oldest national sporting event in Asia that is related to golfing. The first Philippine Open was held in 1913 at the City of Caloocan at the former location of the Manila Golf Club. It was being held there from 1913 up to 1934. From 1913 to 1928, only non-Filipinos were allowed to participate in the Philippine Open. The Philippine open is the oldest national championship in the field of golf in Asia.\nFirst Filipino golf champion.\nIn 1929, Larry Montes, who became skillful in golf by working as a caddie at Muni Links, became the first Filipino was allowed to play in this Philippine golf competition, under the sponsorship of a \"kind-hearted\" American. The identity of Montes's American sponsor had never been recorded thus his identity is unknown.\nAs customary during the time, any winner of the Philippine Open was entitled to be seated at his or her place presidential table while the awards dinner was being held. Montes was temporarily allowed to sit at the presidential table, but was later requested to leave from his seat during the middle of the awarding ceremony. This was because of the then existing regulation of the golf club that does not allow any caddie to enter the premises of the golf clubhouse. That situation changed when an American member of the golfclub named William \"Bill\" Shaw formed the Wack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club, after being angered by what happened to Montes during his awarding ceremony in 1929. Shaw opened the doors wide to Filipinos of the Wack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club by making that golf club \"open to all races and free from any [form of] discrimination\".\nWack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club.\nThe Philippine Open was almost exclusively hosted by the Wack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club from 1935 up to the end of the 1980s. There were a few years however, after World War II, when the Philippine Open was sometimes held at different golfing locations, such as the Holiday Hills (which was latered renamed as TAT Filipinas), at the Valley Golf Club, at the Puerto Azul and at the Villamor Golf Course. Because of this almost exclusive hosting of the Philippine Open by the Wack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club, the Philippine Open became known also as the Wack Wack's Open.\nAsian golf tournaments in Manila.\nUnder the banner of the Wack Wack's Open - the Philippine Open - the Philippines became a golfing tournament destination for notable professional golfers from Australia, the United States, South Africa, and Spain. Among those who played in Asian golf competitions that were held in Manila were Australian Norman Guy Von Nida from 1938 to 1939, American Ed \"Porky\" Oliver in 1949, American Lloyd Mangrum in 1951, Australians Bruce Crampton, Kel Nagle, and Peter Thomson during the 1960s and the 1970s, South African Gary Player, and Americans Doug Sanders and Sam Snead. In 1977, Spaniards Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido won during that year's World Cup tournament that was held in the Philippines. The names of golfers such as Fred Couples and Kyi Hla Han also participated in the several golf tournaments that were held in the Philippines. A notable golf tournament that included Manila as a destination was the Asian Professional Tour (also known simply as the Asian Tour). A notable golf competition sponsor in Manila was the Resorts World Manila. It sponsors the Resorts World Manila Masters tournaments.\nOther notable Filipino golfers.\nFilipino men golfers.\nApart from Larry Montes, there were other Filipinos who excelled in the field of golfing in the Philippines and in the Philippine Open competitions. Among them were Casiano Decena (1934), Guillermo Narvaja (1935), Celestino Tugot (1956), Ben Arda (1956), Luis \"Golem\" Silverio (1966), Ernesto \"Moyo\" Toleco (1974), Quintin Mancao (1976), Rudy Labares (1984), Mario Manubay (1986), Robert Pactolerin (1990), Frankie Miñoza (1998), Gerald Rosales (2000), Felix Casas (2001) and Juvic Pagunsan (2004). In relation to the so-called Asian Tour in golf competition, the Filipinos who became prominent were Frankie Minoza, Angelo Que, Artemio Murakami and Juvic Pagunsan. In 2011, Pagunsan became the first Filipino golfer to win the \nAsian Tour Order of Merit title. The youngest Filipino to earn the so-called \"Asian Tour card\" was Miguel Tabuena. In the 2012 Asian Development Tour (ADT, a \"feeder circuit\" to the Asian Tour), Jay Baron became \"most successful [golf] player\". Another notable name in the Asian Development Tour and in the Aboitiz Invitational golf tournaments was Elmer Salvador.\nFilipino women golfers.\nFilipino women joined the rows and ranks of Filipino men golf-gamers in 1938. The first Filipino woman to compete in the field of golf dominated by European and American lady golfers was Dominga Capati during the 1938 Philippine Women's Open Golf Championship. Capati took some time-off as a laundrywoman to excel in golf. It was in Capati's honor that the Dominga Capati Memorial Tournament was held at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club on March 19, 1968.\nWomen's Golf Association of the Philippines.\nAn association of women golfers known as the Women's Golf Association of the Philippines (WGAP) was later established in 1971 by accomplished Filipino women golfers Edeng Feliciano, Ditas Valles, Charing Villar and Nellie Jhocson. The logo of the WGAP (an image composed of green and gold coloration) was designed by Filipino female golfer Cora Suntay. The WGAP was recognized by the Republic Golf Association of the Philippines (currently known as the National Golf Association of the Philippines) and had been responsible for competitions known collectively as the \"WGAP Circuit\" of tournaments. The first among the WGAP Circuit competitions was the Philippine Ladies Open tournament. The WGAP, through its then president Gina Tuason, later held the 1993 Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao Tournament (abbreviated as LuzViMin Tournament; Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao are the three main islands of the Philippine archipelago) with the goal of unifying the country and the nation's female golfers. In 2000, the Women's Golf Association of the Philippines held the WGAP Cup \"match-play\" tournament.\nNational Golf Association of the Philippines.\nDuring the 1990s, the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP) became the national sports body for gold that organizes the Philippine Open. Taking over from the Wack Wack Golf &amp; Country Club, the NGAP held the Philippine Open in other golf courses in the Philippines, such as golfing locations in Camp John Hay in Baguio, in the Apo Golf Club in Davao in Mindanao, in the Riviera in Cavite in Luzon, and in the Manila Southwoods Golf and Country Club in Metro Manila. By the end of the 1990s, the Asian Professional Tour was replaced by the Asia PGA Tour (also became known as Asian Tour, the nickname of its predecessor)."

The NCAA is divided into three divisions, based on school size and enrollment. Each division is made up of several conferences for regional league play. Over time, these conferences will disband due to lack of teams, joining of their teams to other conferences, lack of budget, merging to another conference, stopped sponsoring basketball or simply a command from the NCAA.\nCollege basketball was started in 1895 with its first ever game between Hamline and Minnesota. It was later developed in 1896 with its first game in a five player format with Chicago against Iowa. Almost all schools are independent at that time until since the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (now NCAA) in 1906. But even before the development, conferences began to form, such as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (now Big Ten Conference) in 1896 which is the oldest active conference in the NCAA, and the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League formed in 1901, which was folded into the Ivy League in 1955.\nAs of July 2019, there are 30 defunct conferences in total: 20 conferences in Division I, six in Division II and four in Division III. The defunct conference that was active for the shortest period is the Northern California Conference, formed in 1937 and ended in 1939; the longest-lived defunct conference is the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), which has a span of 89 years (1924 to 2013). The most recent conference to dissolve is the Division II Heartland Conference, which disbanded at the end of the 2018–19 school year, with seven of its nine members joining the Lone Star Conference and the other two moving to the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association."

Most teams have licensed kits as well as kits worn during the World Cup for all 32 teams that qualified in real life plus other selected teams that did not, while other teams have generic unlicensed kits which resemble their official kits. As with the 2010 game however, all teams contain fully licensed players and stats.\nThe game includes all 12 venues used at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as stadiums from each qualifying region and a range of generic stadiums.\nSoundtrack.\nThe official song of the World Cup, \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte, was included in the game's opening cutscene, as well as \"The World Is Ours\" by \"The X Factor USA\" contestant David Correy, which was soft drink company and World Cup sponsors Coca-Cola's theme song for the 2014 tournament.\nAdditionally, the game features \"EA Sports Talk Radio\", where players can choose one of three channels, each featuring a pair of pundits commenting on user-controlled teams' progress and answering e-mails, texts, and tweets. Andy Goldstein of Talksport and Ian Darke of ESPN host one channel, while the Men in Blazers (Michael Davies and Roger Bennett - both of ESPN at the time but now with NBC Sports) host the second channel and the third channel features the voices of Ian St John and Jimmy Greaves, famous for their partnership at ITV hosting Saturday afternoon football preview show \"Saint and Greavsie\" between 1985 and 1992.\nThe game includes 34 tracks from artists all over the world including Australia, Canada, Israel, Mexico, the United States and Brazil.\nReception.\n\"2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, according to Metacritic.\nPlatforms criticism.\nThe game was criticised for being available on only a few platforms. Despite releasing the game during the eighth generation of video game consoles, Electronic Arts decided against developing versions of the game for the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One or PC, as there were several major regions in the world where such systems were not adopted widely enough, especially the host country, Brazil."

        "title": "1977–78 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1977–78 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1977–78 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his sixth season as head coach. An independent, Georgetown played its home games at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C., and finished the season with a record of 23-8. Knocked out of the ECAC South-Upstate Region tournament in the semifinals, the team missed an NCAA tournament bid for the second consecutive season. The Hoyas instead appeared in the 1978 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), their second straight NIT appearance, and finished in fourth place.\nSeason recap.\nAfter going 2-2 to open the season, the 1977-78 Hoyas set a new school record for most consecutive victories, winning 13 games in a row between December 7, 1977, and January 28, 1978. Senior guard and team captain Derrick Jackson led the way, continuing a streak of scoring in double figures begun the previous season that stretched to 44 straight games before ending this year. Early in the season, Jackson surpassed Jonathan Smith as the top Hoya scorer of all time; by mid-season, he had become the first Hoya to score more than 1,500 points in his career.\nDuring the streak, Georgetown played in the ECAC Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden in New York City, winning both games, one of which was an upset of No. 12-ranked Holy Cross on December 27; sophomore guard John Duren averaged 22 points per game in the two games and was declared the tournaments Most Valuable Player. Duren would go on to score in double figures in 27 of the seasons 31 games. In the second game of the tournament, against Alabama on December 29, junior forward Steve Martin scored 18 points.\nSophomore forward Craig \"Big Sky\" Shelton scored 25 points against Maryland in the second game of the year, but suffered a broken wrist early in the season and missed five games. After returning to action, he scored 20 or more points eight times during the last 19 games of the year, finishing the season with an average of 14.1 points per game.\nSenior center Ed Hopkins scored 29 points against North Carolina Central. Junior forward Al Dutchs free-throw shooting prowess helped Georgetown in two big wins over Seton Hall and Manhattan, but otherwise he had a difficult season, averaging only 5.0 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Thompson announced the following summer that Dutch would take the 1978-79 season off for personal reasons and return to the team for the 1979-80 season.\nA highlight of the regular season was the visit of No. 17-ranked Detroit – led by Terry Duerod, John Long, and Terry Tyler, and coached by Dick Vitale – to McDonough Gymnasium on February 11, 1978. Detroit had a record of 19-1 and the longest winning streak in the nation at the time and was averaging 93.5 points per game, while Georgetown had just dropped out of the Top 20 entirely – plunging from No. 14 the week before – thanks to a pair of losses to begin the month. Shelton played an outstanding defensive game and scored 20 points, while Steve Martin scored 22 and Ed Hopkins pulled down a career-high 16 rebounds. Although the Hoyas trailed with less than a minute to play, they came back to tie the game and then Shelton dunked over Tyler to give Georgetown an 82-80 lead. The Hoyas upset Detroit 83-82.\nEleven days later, George Washington visited McDonough. After the Colonials scored to take the lead with two seconds left to play, Thompson put senior reserve guard Craig Esherick into the game. Esherick caught the inbounds pass at halfcourt and put up a 40-foot (12-meter) shot that scored as time expired to tie the game and force overtime. Eshericks shot was arguably the greatest of the 1970s for the Hoyas, and Georgetown went on to win in overtime, 78-77.\nAlthough retaining its status as an independent, Georgetown was in its fourth season as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), a loosely organized sports federation that held three regional post-season Division I basketball tournaments in 1978 for independent Eastern colleges and universities similar to the end-of-season conference tournaments held by conventional college basketball conferences, with each tournament winner receiving an at-large bid to the 1978 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Georgetown had won the ECAC South Region tournament in 1975 and 1976 to secure an NCAA bid; this year the Hoyas participated in the ECAC Upstate-South Region tournament as a heavy favorite to win a third ECAC regional title. However, just before the opening tip of the first game of the tournament, a semifinal contest against Virginia Commonwealth, Derrick Jackson was rushed to the hospital with what was thought to be an attack of acute appendicitis but turned out to be a duodenal ulcer. The illness brought his senior season to an end, and the Hoyas sorely missed him in the game; although Duren scored 23 points, Virginia Commonwealth beat Georgetown 88-75. Jackson ended the season with a school-record 88% free-throw shooting percentage for the year that has yet to equalled, and a 49% field-goal and 77% free-throw shooting percentage for his career. He had been the schools leading scorer in three seasons.\nThe ECAC Tournament loss meant that the Hoyas missed an NCAA tournament bid for the second year in a row. Georgetown instead accepted an invitation to the 1978 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), its second consecutive NIT appearance. In the first round, played at Virginia, the Hoyas fell behind the Cavaliers, but Duren scored 22 points and had 11 assists and Georgetown came back to tie the game and force overtime. With seconds left in overtime and the game tied 68-68, senior guard Mike Riley managed to draw an offensive foul on a Virginia inbounds pass, then sank both his free throws to give Georgetown a 70-68 win. The 1977-78 squad thus became the first Georgetown men's basketball team to win a game in either the National Invitation Tournament or NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament since the 1942-43 team advanced to the final of the 1943 NCAA tournament.\nGeorgetown next beat Dayton in the second round, with Duren scoring 17 points and Steve Martin shooting 10-for-10 from the free-throw line and scoring 18. The Hoyas faced North Carolina State in the semifinal. Duren had a 26-point game, Shelton scored 25, and Esherick again scored on a last-minute shot to tie the game as the clock expired and force overtime. Georgetown was leading 85-84 in overtime with almost no time left and on the brink of going to the first NIT final in school history when North Carolina States Clyde Austin scored on a 40-foot (12-meter) last-second shot to give the Wolfpack an 86-85 win. The Hoyas had to settle for an appearance in the third-place game against Rutgers, which Georgetown lost for a fourth-place finish despite John Durens 23-point effort. During the NIT, Craig Shelton had shot 61 percent from the field and averaged 16 points and nine rebounds per game.\nUnranked in the Associated Press Poll at the end of the year, the Hoyas were ranked No. 20 for the season in the Coaches' Poll. They would not play in the NIT again until the 1992-93 season. During each of the 14 intervening seasons, Georgetown would receive an NCAA Tournament bid.\nAlthough English bulldogs named Jack have appeared along the sidelines of Georgetown basketball times during various seasons since 1962, the 1977-78 season was the first in which a human in a bulldog costume portrayed Jack the Bulldog. Originated by Georgetown freshman Pat Sheehan, who was Jack for four seasons before graduating in 1981, the human Jack the Bulldog has been a fixture at Georgetown games ever since.\nRoster.\nSource\nSenior guard Craig Esherick would later serve as an assistant coach for the Hoyas from 1982 to 1999 and as head coach from 1999 to 2004. Senior guard Mike Riley would later serve as a Hoya assistant coach from 1982 to 2004.\nRankings.\nSource\nThe 1977-78 squad was only the second team in Georgetown men's basketball history to be ranked in the Associated Press Poll, and the first one to be ranked since the 1952-53 team's No. 20 ranking for a week in January 1953. It also ended the season ranked No. 20 in the Coaches' Poll, becoming the first Georgetown men's basketball team in history to finish a season with a national ranking.\n1977–78 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| ECAC Upstate-South Region tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation tournament"

With the ratification to name Brazil as host, this marked the country's first time to host a FIFA youth competition, having previously hosted the senior World Cup twice as well as the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and numerous editions of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nEngland were the defending champions, but unable to defend their title after being eliminated in the group stages at the 2019 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in the Republic of Ireland. England became the second consecutive title holders that failed to qualify. Brazil won their fourth U-17 World Cup title, winning 2–1 against Mexico in the final, which was also the first time in the history that Brazil won a FIFA World Cup tournament at home soil.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding process to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup was launched by FIFA in June 2017. A member association may bid for both tournaments, but they would be awarded to different hosts.\nOriginal round of bidding.\nTwo countries publicly declared their formal bids to host the tournament.\nOn 8 March 2018, Rwanda withdrew its bid to host the tournament due to time and logistic aspects. FIFA then unanimously announced Peru as the host country after the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogotá, Colombia.\nSecond round of bidding.\nOn 22 February 2019, FIFA announced that the tournament would be moved to a yet-to-be-determined host after inspection visits found issues with the prepared infrastructure and organization in Peru. On the same day, FIFA Secretary-General Fatma Samoura sent a letter to the Brazilian Football Confederation to determine if the tournament could be held in that country, and the answer was positive. CONMEBOL reinforced the idea by claiming that, because of the preparation for the 2019 Copa América, which was scheduled to start in less than four months, Brazil would be the only one able to make the commitment in such a short time. With the change of venue, the tournament was delayed by three weeks. Brazil was confirmed as the new host by the FIFA Council on 15 March 2019. However, of all the stadiums that were chosen to host the Copa América 2019 games were not used as all the venues were used as training venues by the participant's national squads.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams qualified for the final tournament. Brazil as host team along with 23 other teams qualified from six separate continental competitions. The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Council on 10 June 2018.\nVenues.\nThe tournament used four venues in three cities.\nOrganization.\nEmblem.\nThe official emblem was unveiled on 10 July 2019 ahead of the draw. The emblem takes its inspiration from the country's rich history and diverse landscapes, with a variety of distinctive elements coming together to form the shape of the tournament trophy. The base evokes the lush green of Brazil's natural scenery. Sweeping vegetation leads the viewer's eye past the intense reds of the Brazilian soil and yellowy orange of the country's world-famous gemstones towards a celebratory figure. That figure, in turn, reaches towards a ball, the design of which is inspired by the iconic curved columns of Cathedral of Brasília, a masterpiece by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.\nDraw and schedule.\nThe match schedule was unveiled on 10 July 2019, the day before the final draw. The kick-off times were confirmed on 25 July 2019.\nThe final draw was held on 11 July 2019, 15:00 CEST (), at the FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The draw ceremony was presented by Bruno Sassi and conducted by FIFA Director of Competitions Christian Unger, with the former U-17 World Cup champions Nigerian Celestine Babayaro and the former Brazilian footballer Sonny Anderson, acting as draw assistants. The ceremony was also attended by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Brazilian Football Confederation President Rogério Caboclo.\nThe 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams with hosts Brazil being automatically seeded into Pot 1 and assigned to the first position of group A. The remaining teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-17 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), as follows:\nFurthermore, five bonus points were added to each of the 6 continental champions from the qualifying\ntournaments.\nThe draw started with the hosts Brazil being \"drawn\" to A1. Teams from Pot 1 were drawn first, followed by Pot 2, Pot 3, and finally Pot 4, with each team also drawn to one of the positions within their group. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn within the same group.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\nMatch officials.\nA total of 20 refereeing trios (a referee and two assistant referees), 5 support referees, and 17 video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament.\nSquads.\nPlayers born on or after 1 January 2002 and on or before 31 December 2004 were eligible to compete in the tournament.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of between 22 and 50 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\nAll times are local, BRT ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best third-placed teams from the six groups advance to the knockout stage along with the six group winners and six runners-up.\nIn the next stage the four third-placed teams will be matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D according to the tournament regulations.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, the match would be directly decided by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner; no extra time would be played.\nIn the round of 16, the four third-placed teams would be matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Trophy\nFinal ranking.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws."

The Soviet Union, whose record is now inherited by Russia, previously won the inaugural U-20 World Cup in 1977.\nIn the group stages, Norway's 12-0 win against Honduras was the biggest winning margin in the main stages of any major men's FIFA tournament, while Erling Haaland's 9 goals in the same match made him the only player to score a triple hat-trick at any significant intercontinental tournament for national teams for any gender.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding process to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup was launched by FIFA in June 2017.

        "title": "1982–83 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1982–83 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1982–83 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 11th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 22-10 overall, 11-5 in Big East play. They lost to Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the 1983 Big East tournament and advanced to the second round of the 1983 NCAA tournament before losing to Memphis State.\nSeason recap.\nThe season saw the arrival of former Georgetown players Craig Esherick and Mike Riley as assistant coaches. Esherick would serve as an assistant coach for 17 seasons before himself becoming head coach during the 1998–99 season, while Riley would be an assistant coach for 22 seasons before leaving after the 2003–04 season.\nGeorgetown had lost five players to graduation after the teams NCAA national runner-up performance the previous season and played a junior, three sophomores, and two freshmen most of the season, but center Patrick Ewing was returning for his sophomore year, and the team was ranked No. 2 as the season began. Pressure grew during the summer of 1982 for a game with No. 1 Virginia in the upcoming season, with arenas nationwide jockeying to host it; Georgetown insisted on hosting it at the Capital Centre. Three television networks bid on it, and Superstation TBS won the rights to it with a $550,000 bid; billed as the \"Game of the Decade\", it thus became the first major college sports event telecast exclusively on cable television. In the game, held on December 11, 1982, Virginias veteran team won, 68–63, but Ewing at one point slam-dunked right over highly regarded Virginia center Ralph Sampson, a play which established Ewing as a dominating \"big man\".\nGeorgetown opened Big East play for the season on January 8, 1983, with a game against St. John's at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In both this and the second St. John's game of the season, 6-foot-3 Redmen guard Kevin Williams was given the task of harassing Ewing and goading him into retaliating, but Ewing nonetheless averaged 17 points and 13.5 rebounds in the two games combined. Harassment from the stands was a bigger problem. Ever since Ewing had committed to play at Georgetown in 1981, rumors and accusations had circulated among fans of other teams and sportswriters that Ewing was academically unworthy of Georgetown University and unable to pass his classes, and he endured cruel taunts about his intelligence and his race during Big East road games this season; opposing fans carried signs reading \"EWING CAN'T READ THIS\", \"THINK EWING THINK\", and \"EWING IS AN APE\", and some threw things such as banana peels at him on the court. During the game at Syracuse before a sold-out crowd in the Carrier Dome on January 10, 1983, a fan threw an orange at Ewing while he was attempting a free throw, narrowly missing him and prompting Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim to grab a microphone and tell the crowd that he would pull his team off the court and forfeit the game to Georgetown if such behavior continued; he did not have to, but Georgetown won the game, 97–92. Through it all, Ewing kept his own counsel and continued to play, with a double-double in each of his first five Big East games, 25 points and 17 rebounds against Connecticut on January 15, 1983, 19 games in which he scored in double figures, and 10 games in which he scored 20 or more points and pulled down 10 or more rebounds. For the season, he led the team in scoring, averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds per game.\nFreshman guard Michael Jackson joined the team this season. A starter from the first game, he quickly became an offensive standout who showed an ability to play both point guard and shooting guard. In the game at Syracuse in which someone threw an orange at Ewing, Jackson shot 9-for-13 from the field and 13-for-15 from the free-throw line to score 31 points and lead the Hoyas to the win. Against Boston College, he scored 21 points. Over the course of the season, he shot 46% from the field and 82% from the free-throw line, led the team in scoring in five games, averaged 14.1 points per game in Big East conference play, and finished behind only Ewing as the teams second-highest scorer.\nAnother newcomer was freshman guard-forward David Wingate, who displayed a defensive ability that allowed him to shut down many opponents. He played in all 32 games, shot 44% from the field, and scored in double figures 24 times, including a season-high 24-point performance against American.\nSophomore forward Bill Martin had been a reserve the previous season, but he became a starter this year, playing in all 32 games. He had 30 points and seven rebounds against Alabama State and 24 points and seven rebounds against Alabama. In Big East play, he reliably scored 10 points a game and shot 37-for-43 (86%) from the free-throw line. He finished the season averaging 6.3 rebounds per game, second only to Ewing.\nJunior guard-forward Fred Brown had undergone knee surgery before the season began and recovering from it limited his playing time. He came off the bench to play in one game in December 1982, started 14 games in mid-season, then played in only two more games, both as a reserve, after the February 9, 1983, game against St. John's.\nJunior guard and team captain Gene Smith, a defensive specialist, played a critical role in leading the young team, especially with Fred Brown limited for much of the year. He led the Hoyas in steals and assists and finished the season with nearly a two-to-one assist-to-turnover ratio.\nThe Hoyas finished in fourth place in the Big East, their 11-5 conference record earning them a bye in the first round of the 1983 Big East men's basketball tournament, but they lost their first game of the tournament to Syracuse in the quarterfinals. They were the No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region of the 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the fifth of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – and advanced to the second round before losing to the Midwest Regions No. 4 seed, 17th-ranked Memphis State.\nThe least successful of the four teams of the Ewing era and the only one not to reach the NCAA national championship game, the 1982–83 Hoyas nonetheless had performed well, especially given their youth and inexperience. They were ranked No. 20 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll, and the average attendance at their home games for the season was 14th-highest in the country.\nRankings.\nSource\n1982–83 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"
