        "title": "Danny Barrett (American football)",
        "text": "Danny Barrett (born December 18, 1961) is an American football coach and former player who is the running backs coach for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He served as the interim head coach for the UCF Knights in 2015, and is a former Canadian Football League (CFL) quarterback. He has been the head coach of the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders and the running backs coach of the Miami Dolphins.\nPlaying career.\nBefore playing professional football with the Calgary Stampeders, Barrett was a star at the University of Cincinnati. In 1982, he co-captained the Bearcats and earned an Honorable Mention Associated Press All-American nomination. During his professional playing career, Barrett played in 163 regular season CFL games with Calgary, Toronto, B.C. and Ottawa. His career totals include; 23,419 yards passing, 1,656 completions in 3,078 attempts and 133 touchdowns passed. At one point, he held the record for most passing yards (601) in a CFL game.\nIn 1985, Barrett saw playing time as a slotback with the Calgary Stampeders hauling in 32 passes for 455 yards and two touchdowns. Barrett also quarterbacked the 1987 Argonauts and the 1991 Stampeders to Grey Cup appearances. In the 1991 Grey Cup, Barrett set a CFL record for completions with 34. In 1992, Barrett was selected as the Tom Pate recipient while a member of the BC Lions for his outstanding contributions to the league, his team and his community. This award was voted on by the CFLPA. In 1993, still as a member of the BC Lions, Barrett briefly held the CFL record for passing in a single game, with 601 yards, which was surpassed the following year by Matt Dunigan (713 yards).\nCoaching career.\nBarrett joined the coaching fraternity in 1997 with the Calgary Stampeders. As a first year assistant coach, Barrett was in charge of the Stampeder quarterbacks, which included Jeff Garcia, Dave Dickenson and Henry Burris. In 1998, his first season with the BC Lions, Barrett began the season on the sidelines as the quarterback coach and assistant offensive coordinator but was forced out of retirement and dressed as the Lions’ backup quarterback for 15 games. During the 1999 campaign, Barrett coached the Lions’ receiver corps.\nIn 1999, Roy Shivers, the former director of player personnel for the Calgary Stampeders, assumed the duties of general manager of the Roughriders. Shivers hired Barrett as the head coach despite the latter's limited coaching experience. The Roughriders made football history by being the first professional team with a black general manager and head coach. The team improved during Barrett's first four seasons, largely because Shivers—an astute appraiser of football talent with many connections to U.S. college teams—recruited and signed better players. In 2003 the team ended with an 11-7 record, and lost a close Western final playoff game to the Edmonton Eskimos. The team seemed on the verge of being championship calibre.\nBy 2006, after three consecutive .500 seasons—capped by a humiliating 2006 Western final loss to the BC Lions by a score of 45-18—an increasing number of fans began to question the leadership provided by Shivers and Barrett, and Shivers eventually was dismissed by the team's board of directors. On August 23, 2006 the Roughriders hired Eric Tillman as general manager. There was rampant speculation that Barrett would be dismissed, but Tillman was publicly circumspect. In the weeks leading to his ultimate departure, Barrett was unusually—and perhaps unwisely—expressive to the media about his views on the firing of Shivers. Reports indicate that Tillman had offered Barrett a one-year contract to continue as head coach, but either Barrett rejected the offer or Tillman withdrew it.\nBarrett coached the Riders in more regular season games than any other coach in Roughrider history; however, Barrett posted a winning record only once in his previous seven years of coaching the Roughriders. His overall record as head coach of the Roughriders was 57 wins, 68 losses, and one tie.\nOn February 7, 2007, Barrett turned down an offensive coordinator position offered by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and opted to become the quarterbacks and assistant head coach at the University at Buffalo.\nOn December 13, 2009, Barrett was named interim head coach of the Buffalo Bulls after spending two seasons (2007 and 2008) as the Bulls quarterbacks coach/assistant head coach. The move followed the departure of Turner Gill, who left Buffalo to take the head coaching position at the University of Kansas.\nOn February 10, 2010, the \"Daytona Beach News-Journal\" reported Barrett was named offensive coordinator—in charge of the \"Speedway Offense\"—at Bethune-Cookman University.\nOn February 21, 2011, UCFAthletics.com reported Barrett was named running backs coach at UCF.\nOn January 14, 2015, UCFKnights.com reported that Barrett was moved from running backs coach to quarterbacks coach at UCF.\nOn October 25, 2015, UCFKnights.com reported that Barrett was announced as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2015 season, after George O'Leary announced his retirement from football.\nOn January 23, 2016, Barrett was hired by the Miami Dolphins to be their running backs coach.\nOn January 19, 2018, Barrett was hired by the Houston Texans to be their running backs coach. He was retained by a new coaching staff on March 10, 2021. He was also retained by the new head coaches in 2022 and 2023 adding the title of assistant head coach in 2023."

        "title": "Douglas Murray (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Douglas Thomas Lars Murray (born March 12, 1980), nickname \"Crankshaft\", is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman. He was drafted in the 8th round, 241st overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nMurray's Swedish mother is a daughter of Lars Björn, an ice hockey defenceman, twice World champion and an Olympic bronze-medalist. His father's ancestors originate from Scotland. While his cousins all have Swedish names, his parents gave their children Scottish or English names. Murray's brothers are named Charles and Ted, with a sister named Roseanna.\nMurray attended Portledge School in Locust Valley, New York, for his junior and senior years of high school, and played for the New York Apple Core in nearby Long Beach, before attending Cornell University. He graduated from Cornell in 2003 with a B.S. degree in hotel administration.\nPlaying career.\nFrom 1999–2000 to 2002–03, he played for Cornell University. While at Cornell, he served as captain his senior year and was twice named a first team All-American. He was nominated to the Hobey Baker Memorial Award Final Ten in 2003. In the 2003–04 and the locked-out 2004–05 season he played for San Jose's minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Barons, and contributed both offensively and defensively, leading the team in plus/minus and being second on the team in points for a defenseman. He also served as an alternate captain. He was awarded the Cleveland Barons Rubbermaid \"Player of the Year\" (along with Josh Gorges) in 2005.\nDuring the 2005–06 NHL season, he was called up to San Jose, due to various injuries plaguing the team's defense. In his short time there that season, he gained praise for his physical presence, as well as solid defense, from such San Jose organization members as TV color commentator Drew Remenda.\nMurray renewed his contract with the Sharks in June 2006, signing a three-year-deal worth US$1.65 million. Part of that deal was a $150,000 signing bonus. In late September 2008, he agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Sharks supposedly worth US$10 million.\nHis first NHL goal was scored in his 115th career game on February 21, 2008, against Martin Biron of the Philadelphia Flyers.\nIn the pre-season game of September 26, 2009, Murray performed a hat trick, scoring 3 even strength goals against the Anaheim Ducks, leading to the 6–0 shutout victory, though it was unofficial due to it being in the pre-season. If it had been in the regular season, it would have been his first and only career NHL hat trick.\nIn 2010, he was chosen as the 16th-smartest athlete in sports by \"Sporting News\".\nOn March 25, 2013, the Sharks traded Murray to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Pittsburgh's second round pick in the 2013 draft and a conditional second round pick in 2014. The Sharks later received the conditional pick due to Pittsburgh's progression through two rounds in the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nOn August 22, 2013, Murray signed as a free agent to a one-year contract worth $1.5 million with the Montreal Canadiens.\nHe was not re-signed by the Canadiens at the end of his contract and unable to attract NHL interest, signed a one-year deal with Kölner Haie of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga on January 20, 2015. In the 2014–15 season, Murray was limited to just 8 appearances with the Kölner Haie before suffering injury. On March 13, 2015, Murray returned to North America and signed a professional try-out contract to practice with the Calgary Flames.\nMurray announced his retirement on October 21, 2016.\nInternational play.\nDuring the 2008 IIHF World Championship, Murray checked Russian player Aleksey Morozov out of the game. Morozov suffered a severe concussion, while Murray received a match penalty.\nMurray represented Sweden in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nPersonal life.\nAs of the fourth season of the \"Parneviks\" reality show in 2018, Douglas was in a relationship with Penny Parnevik (born 1997), daughter of professional golfer Jesper Parnevik. On February 1 2019 the couple were engaged. Their son, named Atticus, was born in 2019. The couple married in June 2022. \nMurray is the co-founder and managing partner of Uber Dispensing Co, which manufactures the UberTap, a hands-free three-spout keg tap invented by Murray and several friends from Cornell. Incidentally, while Murray represented Sweden in ice hockey at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, another of the company's co-founders, Jamie Moriarty, represented the U.S. in four-man bobsled at the same Olympics. He once rang the bell at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the summer of 2006.\nAs of April 24 2019 Murray was pursuing several business ventures in Northern California and serving as President and Director of the Sharks Alumni Foundation."

There are several such dips held around Europe, but the largest is organised by the Red sky Foundation and Lions Club of Sunderland, England. Participants are expected to wear fancy dress and jump into the North Sea. (See also Winter swimming).\nTenby's Boxing Day swim.\nThe swim in Pembrokeshire, Wales, started in 1970 and has become Tenby's main Christmas attraction, with around 600 swimmers and thousands of onlookers each year. With everyone swimming for charity, and the majority in fancy dress, each of the swimmers receives a medal for their efforts. Started by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association (TSSA), the Osborne family has been associated with the spectacle from the beginning and Chris Osborne, chairman of TSSA has seen the event take place in every weather condition from brilliant sunshine to freezing wind.\nSunderland's Boxing Day dip.\nIt is held at Seaburn beach in Sunderland and it attracts one thousand dippers every year. Up to five thousand spectators turn out to witness the dip, including the City’s Mayor and Mayoress. Originating in 1974 the dip is one of the oldest events in the country. The dip of 2004 raised nearly £60,000 for charity, with several teams taking part. \nNorth Sea Volunteer Lifeguards' Boxing Day swim at Whitley Bay.\nA swim or dip in the sea over the festive period (be it Christmas, Boxing Day, or New Year) is a traditional event for many lifeguard clubs across the UK, despite sea temperatures ranging anywhere from 4 °C to 10 °C.North Sea Volunteer Lifeguards (NSVL) has held a Boxing Day swim every year since the club's formation in 1998, jumping in the North Sea from their base at Whitley Bay on the north-east coast of England.

        "title": "Cricket helmet",
        "text": "Helmets in cricket were developed in the 20th century.\nHistory.\nThere are recorded instances of cricketers using scarves and padded caps to protect themselves throughout cricket history. Patsy Hendren was one of the first to use a self-designed protective hat in the 1930s. Helmets were not in common use until the 1970s. The first helmets were seen in World Series Cricket, with Dennis Amiss being the first player to consistently wear a helmet which was a customised motorcycle helmet.\nMike Brearley was another player who wore his own design. Tony Greig was of the opinion that they would make cricket more dangerous by encouraging bowlers to bounce the batsmen. Graham Yallop of Australia was the first to wear a protective helmet to a test match on 17 March 1978, when playing against West Indies at Bridgetown. Later Dennis Amiss of England popularised it in Test cricket. \nHelmets began to be widely worn thereafter.\nThe last batsmen at the highest (Test match) level to never wear a helmet throughout his career was Viv Richards, who retired from the international game in 1991. A number of career ending injuries including to Craig Spearman and Craig Kieswetter and research from the England and Wales Cricket Board led to the current improvements seen in modern day helmets.\nModern day cricket helmets.\nModern day cricket helmets are made in compliance with the recent safety standards of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and have to conform to the British Standard BS7928:2013.\nMaterials used for making cricket helmets are impact resistance materials like ABS Plastic, Fibreglass, carbon fibre, titanium, steel and high density foam etc. Main parts of a cricket helmets are grill (made with steel, titanium or carbon fibre), chin strap, inner foam material, outer impact resistant shell etc.\nIn 2019 new standards for helmets were published British Standards BS7928:2013+A1:2019 This provided the introduction of standards for neck protectors to be worn as part of the head protector. The development, testing, manufacturer and accredited standard was brought in expediently as an additional safety feature, following the tragic death of the Australian international batsmen Phillip Hughes. Neck protectors are worn as an attachment to modern helmets and grilles and cover a vulnerable area at the base of the skull. As of October 2022, England and Wales Cricket Board mandated the use of the additional neck protectors in all instance of batting and close fielding.\nLegislation.\nAs of 2023, the ICC has made wearing Of Helmets a must For High-Risk Positions which are: (a) batting against fast or medium paced bowling; (b) wicket-keeping up to the stumps; and (c) fielding in a position closer than seven metres from the batter’s position on the popping crease on a middle stump line (such as short leg or silly point), with the exception of any fielding position behind square of the wicket on the off side.\nIn all cricket, as of 2016, England requires all batsmen, wicketkeepers and fielders closer than 8 yards from the wicket to wear helmets. This is mandatory even when facing medium-pace and spin bowling. \nNew Zealand and India do not require batsmen to wear helmets.\nAustralia requires helmets to be worn by batsmen if facing fast or medium-paced bowling; wicketkeepers if keeping up to the stumps; and all fielders in positions within 7 metres of the batsman, with the exception of any fielding position behind square of the wicket on the off side.\nOpposition from players.\nMany players refused to wear helmets, either believing that they obstructed their vision when batting, or, just as in the similar debate in ice hockey, feeling helmets were unmanly, a view held by many spectators. Englishman Dennis Amiss was the first player to wear a helmet in the modern game, during a World Series Cricket match, for which both the crowd and other players mocked him. Australian captain Graham Yallop was booed when he wore one in a 1978 match against the West Indies (the first time a helmet was worn in a test match) and West Indian captain Viv Richards viewed such protection as cowardly. India captain Sunil Gavaskar believed that helmets slowed down a batsman's reflexes and refused to wear one. \nIn more recent times, many batsmen have felt that modern helmet designs have become increasingly obstructive. Most notably, England captain Alastair Cook for a time refused to wear a new helmet complying with ICC safety regulations since he felt it was distracting and uncomfortable. His England teammate Jonathan Trott also refused for similar reasons, and teammate Nick Compton (a close friend of Phillip Hughes) felt that the new regulations were overzealous.\nCricket helmet manufacturers.\nThere are a number of cricket helmet manufacturers and brands available. Some of them are Gunn &amp; Moore, Sanspareils Greenlands, and Sareen Sports Industries.\nMany professional cricket players choose to wear the Masuri cricket helmet with the brand being worn by approximately 70% of players competing in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Masuri are also the original inventors of the first neck protector, an additional piece of protective equipment that attaches to the back of the cricket helmet, when they launched their Stem Guard in 2015."

It is now the oldest surviving team sports club in Glasgow.\nOn moving to Pollokshields, the club sold its previous Kinning Park ground in 1873 to a newly founded football club called Rangers. At that time, the club also fielded a football team, Clydesdale which came second to Queens Park in the first Scottish Cup final in 1874, after many associated with the club had been instrumental in the foundation of the Scottish Football Association.\nIn the modern era, Clydesdale Cricket Club continues to be a major force in the amateur sporting worlds of cricket and both men's and women's hockey under the name of Clydesdale Western Hockey Club and has its own international-standard water-based synthetic-surfaced hockey pitch upgraded in 2011.\nMembers and former members of the club were selected to play for Scotland in the 1999 and 2007 Cricket World Cups and in the Olympic Games hockey tournaments in Barcelona, Athens, Beijing and London.\nHome ground.\nIn 2007, Clydesdale's Titwood cricket ground was approved for the staging of official One-Day Internationals for crowds of up to 5,000. It became the fourth Scottish ground to be granted ODI status, as it was seen as a hub of cricket in Scotland along with The Grange, Aberdeenshire's Mannofield and Ayr's Cambusdoon New Ground.\nThe first of these, an 'offshore international' between India and Pakistan in July 2007 was a victim of the wet weather. \nThe second game was played in August the same year, was between Scotland and India.\nIn January 2014, Titwood hosted Scotland's last three Clydesdale Bank 40 home group games."

They then placed an advertisement in the local paper looking for other interested parties and on 17 September 1991 the first meeting of the club was held with twenty-six members.\nThe members originally applied to the Victorian Rugby League for membership in 1991 but couldn't afford the entry fee to begin a club so had to wait until 1992 when the club became officially formed. It commenced its playing in what was known as the Rebel league and in 1994 began with one senior reserve grade team in the VRL Competition. In 1995, the Club started its First Grade team and 6 junior teams. Since 1992 and including 2016, the club has gone on to register a total of 613 senior players.\nThe club (known then as the Sunbury Cougars) played in their first First Grade grand final in 2000. A defeat at the hands of St Kilda. Many Sunbury locals were members of that grand final side with the community really getting behind the club's sudden rise under coach, Richard Puke.\nThe Tigers won their first premiership in 2009, beating Casey Sharks 48–18 in the VRL grand final. 2011 saw the Tigers win their 2nd premiership in 3 years against the North West Wolves in overtime 32–26. In 2013 they won their 3rd Grand final against Altona Roosters 36–16 and in 2014, they won their 4th against a revamped Casey Warriors 48–16. At this stage the Sunbury Tigers have won four of the last eight premierships and may claim to be the current powerhouse of Victorian rugby league, as Altona Roosters and St Kilda Saints were before them.\nIn the 2016 season, the junior and senior clubs merged into one body again, retaining the name Sunbury United Rugby League Club Inc. The club is run by President Tony Gould and a committee.\nNotable players.\nFollowing are players that went on to, or had played professional first grade rugby league."

It is listed as a critically endangered species due to illegal logging; it is also threatened by fire. Only two specimens have ever been found. Both were found within 100m of each other on Mount Kahuzi. Its body length (excluding tail) is 50-100mm and its tail length is 65-132mm. Its habitat is tropical forests, and to navigate these forests it may use its semi-prehensile tail to hold on to tree branches. Its markings are brownish on the top and white to yellow on its underside, with strongly dark rings around its eyes. As with other \"Dendromus\", it has three well defined toes."

The following year, 1904, Collins again reached the doubles finals, this time partnered with Raymond Little and lost in five sets to Holcombe Ward and Beals Wright. In singles, he reached the semifinals twice, in 1899 and 1905, and the quarterfinals in 1902.\nAt the tournament now known at the Cincinnati Masters, the oldest tournament in the U.S. played in its original city, Collins won the singles title in 1903 and reached singles finals in 1901, 1902 and 1905. He also was a doubles finalist in 1901 and 1903 (both times with L.

In 1906, he went with the United States Davis Cup team to England, but did not compete due to trouble with his eyesight. By the next year, his poor eyesight had forced him completely out of competitive tennis. Collins died on 16 November 1909, after being struck by an electric street car in Chicago."

        "title": "Bundesliga (baseball)",
        "text": "The Baseball-Bundesliga is the professional elite competition for the sport of baseball in Germany. In it, the men's German championship is determined annually. Like most European sports leagues, the Bundesliga uses a system of promotion and relegation. The highest division of the Bundesliga currently consists of thirteen teams in two divisions, with each team playing four games against each other team. The league is regulated by the German Baseball and Softball Federation (DBV).\nHistory.\nA precursor to the Baseball-Bundesliga was founded between 1951, with the Stuttgart Phillies winning the inaugural national championship. However, the league disbanded following the 1970 season, leaving Germany without a national league for 11 years.\nThe Baseball-Bundesliga, in its current incarnation, was established in 1982. Two teams produced dynasties during the league's first two decades of operation: the Mannheim Tornados won every championship from 1984 to 1989, and the Paderborn Untouchables won every championship from 2001 to 2005. The league claims that in 1990, there were 2000 baseball players in Germany, while that number has grown to exceed 30,000 today.\nIn 2010, the league promoted the Dohren Wild Farmers and the Neuenburg Atomics. At the end of the season, the Neuenburg Atomics were relegated with the worst record in the Southern Division (1–27). The Saarlouis Hornets voluntarily relegated themselves for financial reasons, despite posting the best record (19–21) in a ten-year history in the first division, causing the Southern Division to contract from eight to seven teams. The two teams were replaced by the Bad Homburg Hornets. In the Northern Division, the Cologne Cardinals were relegated at the end the season and replaced by the champions of the second division, the Berlin Sluggers.\nA motion to reduce the league from 16 to 12 teams was denied by a Competition Commission established by the DBV prior to a general meeting of all the baseball clubs in Germany in Frankfurt am Main on 13 November 2010. At the meeting itself, it was agreed to add an All Star Game for the 2012 season.\nSeason format.\nThe regular season for the 1st Bundesliga is split into two different sub-divisions, Nord (\"North\") and Süd (\"South\") each having 8 teams. The season has a total of 28 games with each team playing every other team in two games which are normally hosted on the weekends. The game format is the same as The MLB with a 9-inning format and extra-innings after if the game is still a tie. Unlike The MLB the 1. Bundesliga also has a mercy rule if one of the 2 teams is leading by 10 runs or more before the last 2 innings of the game, they will stop playing and give a automatic win to the team that is winning by 10 or more runs.\nThe four best-placed teams in each group/sub-divisions of the 1. Bundesliga play in an interleague round with subsequent play-offs for the German championship, while the other teams in each group determine possible relegation in the play-downs.\nIn the interleague round, the top four of each group play in a match against the top four of the other league, with teams playing back-to-back double-header matches in a ballpark on the same day, giving each team a chance to play at home and away. \nAfter the interleague round, the seeding list for the playoffs is determined, this only includes the games of the regular season and the interleague round, between the eight teams involved in the interleague round. 1st vs 8th, 2nd vs 7th and so on.\nThe play-off rounds are a little bit different to the inner-league round although they have a similar concept. All rounds are best of 5 games with the quarter and semi-finals being in a double header format over 2 weekends and on Saturdays. If a game 5 is necessary then the final game will be played on the Sunday after game 3 and 4. The final series is played in individual games instead of the double header format and games are divided up between the teams. Game 1 and 2 are played at the team who did better in the regular season and game 3 and 4 are played in the worse teams home field. Game 5 is played at the better regular season team again if needed which crowns the German Champions (\"Deutscher Meister\")."

He first came to prominence as a comedian in the 1970s and has had his own shows on television and radio.\nEarly life and career.\nCricket was born in Cookstown, County Tyrone,Northern Ireland\nand left school at 16. He spent the next two years working in a betting shop, before spending the summer of 1966 working as a Red Coat in Butlins Holiday camp at Mosney, County Meath. He spent the following two summers at the Butlins Holiday Camp in Clacton, Essex. By the early 1970s he was living in Manchester. From 1972 he worked at the Pontins holiday camps in Southport and Morecambe. He returned to Clacton-on-Sea in 2006 to star in the eight-week summer show, \"Summer Special\" at the West Cliff Theatre.\nJimmy has toured in the UK with other artists such as The Osmonds, Brotherhood of Man, Gerry and the Pacemakers. He has also toured in comedy themed shows with Cannon and Ball, Paul Daniels, Frank Carson and The Krankies. In 2022 he toured with Leah Bell in the, \"Right Royal Knees Up Show\" for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.\nTelevision and radio.\nHe was given his own four television series on a show called \"And There's More\" (named after his best-known catchphrase), produced by Central Television (also notable for including the first TV appearance by Rory Bremner) and Brian Conley.

A popular theme of his comedy is Irish logic, and the ubiquitous letter from his \"Mammy\". He almost always appears in his trademark outfit of cut-off evening trousers, evening tailcoat, hat (given to him by the BBC to wear on \"The Good Old Days\" and wellington boots marked \"L\" and \"R\" for left and right, but worn on the wrong feet. He frequently prefaces an anecdote with the catchphrase: \"Ladies and gentlemen, [beat], come here [or c'mere]\".\nPersonal life.\nCricket lives in Lancashire with his wife, May. He has four children and four grandchildren. Two of his children, Frankie and Katie Mulgrew, followed him into comedy; Katie using her own name, Frankie as 'Frankie Doodle'.

He won 7 singles and 9 doubles titles and reached semi-finals in the 3 of the 4 ATP tour grand slam events. His ATP ranking peaked at 8 in 1973.\nCareer.\nGorman was ranked as high as world No. 8 (consensus) for the year 1973 and No. 10 on the ATP rankings (achieving that ranking on May 1 and June 3, 1974).\nGorman won seven singles titles in his career, the biggest coming in 1975 at Cincinnati. He also won nine doubles titles, including Paris in 1971, the same year he reached the French Open doubles final with Stan Smith. Gorman defeated Björn Borg to win the Stockholm Indoor event in 1973.\nHe reached the semifinal rounds in singles at Wimbledon (in 1971), the US Open (in 1972), and the French Open (in 1973); defeating Rod Laver, Jimmy Connors, and Jan Kodeš respectively. Gorman was a member of the winning U.S. Davis Cup team in 1972. As captain–coach, he led the U.S. Davis Cup team to victory in 1990 and 1992. Gorman holds the record for most match wins (18) by a U.S. Davis Cup captain and is the most current American to have won the Davis Cup as a player and a captain.\nHe was named coach of the Men's U.S Olympic Tennis teams in Seoul, South Korea and Barcelona, Spain. He guided the American doubles team of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso to a gold medal in the doubles competition in Seoul in 1988. In 2001, Gorman and his partner Jaime Fillol of Chile won the Super Masters Seniors at the US Open.\nGorman received praise for his sportsmanship during his 1972 Masters semifinal against Stan Smith in Barcelona. He had injured his back during the course of match, but opened up a 7–6, 6–7, 7–5, 5–4 40–30 lead and held a match point. Knowing that if he were to win the match he would be in no condition to play in the final against Ilie Năstase, he told the umpire that he could not continue and retired. This allowed Smith to instead play in the final, where he was beaten by Năstase in five sets.\nHe attended Seattle Preparatory School and was the Washington State high school tennis champion three years in a row. Gorman attended and graduated from Seattle University and was a two time All-American. He played in professional tour events in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. For eight years, Gorman served as captain of the United States Davis Cup team, coaching some of America's greatest players and winning world championships in 1990 and '92. He oversaw American dream teams made up of tennis champions Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jim Courier, John McEnroe, and Pete Sampras, faced with the unenviable task of dealing with entourages and egos.\nIn November 2008, Gorman was named Director of Tennis at La Quinta Resort &amp; Club and PGA WEST(TM) which he, along with other top American players including Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, and Charlie Pasarell, help found in La Quinta, California. He retired from La Quinta in September 2015.\nGorman was appointed to the prestigious seven person International Tennis Federation Davis Cup Committee for a two-year term in 2012–14.\nFamily.\nGorman and his wife Danni have two grown daughters, Hailey and KellyAnn, and they make their home at Reynolds Lake Oconee in Greensboro,GA."

He was a member of the Sanderson family of Orangeville, Ontario, which has produced a number of lacrosse players and coaches.\nSanderson began his NLL coaching career in 2000 with the Albany Attack. He coached the Attack for two seasons, compiling an 11-15 record. After the 2001 season, Sanderson resigned in order to take the head coach and GM position for the expansion Montreal Express. The Express only lasted a single season before folding.\nIn 2002, Sanderson replaced his brother Lindsay as head coach of the Ottawa Rebel. The Rebel finished the 2003 season dead last in the NLL at 4-12, and folded after the season.\nSanderson was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a builder in 2015.\nThe Toronto Rock.\nBefore the 2004 season began, Toronto Rock head coach and GM Les Bartley announced that he would not be behind the bench for the upcoming season due to his battle with colon cancer, and assistant coaches Ed Comeau and Derek Keenan were promoted to interim head coach and GM respectively. However, after beginning the season 2-4, Comeau and Keenan were fired, and Terry Sanderson was hired as the new GM and head coach. Sanderson turned the Rock around, guiding them to a 10-6 record and first place in the Eastern Division. They lost to Buffalo 19-10 in the division finals.\nDuring the off-season, Sanderson made a blockbuster trade with GM Johnny Mouradian of the San Jose Stealth (himself a former Rock GM), acquiring his son Josh, nephew Phil, and Rusty Kruger for fan favourite Steve Toll, Darryl Gibson, two draft picks, and a player to be named later, who ended up being goaltender Anthony Cosmo. Any cries of \"nepotism\" were silenced during the next season, as Josh set a new single-season assists record with 71, and the Rock finished 12-4 and in first place in the Eastern division for the seventh straight year. They defeated the Rochester Knighthawks in the division finals, and then beat the Arizona Sting in the Championship game, held in Toronto, to win their fifth NLL championship in seven years. Former coach and GM Les Bartley died the day after the Championship game.\n2006 was a disappointing season for the Rock, finishing with their worst record ever, 8-8, and losing to Rochester in the division semi-finals. Less than two weeks after the end of the regular season, Sanderson was fired.\n2007 and beyond.\nSanderson worked with his brother Lindsay once again during the 2007 season. Lindsay, the head coach and GM of the Philadelphia Wings, hired Terry as an assistant coach. Both were relieved of their coaching duties after the season as the Wings missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year.\nOn July 17, 2007, Sanderson was hired by the Calgary Roughnecks to be their defensive coach for the 2008 NLL season.\nOn June 10, 2009, after two seasons in Calgary, including the 2009 championship season, Sanderson was re-hired by the Rock as their new GM and assistant coach.\nOn November 13, 2014, Toronto Rock owner, Jamie Dawick, announced that Sanderson would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from his role as General Manager, with Dawick serving as the interim General Manager in his place.\nDeath.\nOn November 27, 2014, Toronto Rock owner, Jamie Dawick, confirmed, via Twitter, that Sanderson had died due to health issues.\nPersonal life.\nSanderson owned and operated Sanderson's Source for Sports, a hockey and lacrosse equipment store located in Orangeville."

        "text": "The 1976 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round for the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1975–76 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeated the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns 4 games to 2 to win their 13th NBA Championship. Celtics point guard Jo Jo White was named as the series MVP.\nBackground.\nPhoenix Suns.\nThe Phoenix Suns entered the NBA as an expansion team in the 1968–69 season. Prior to 1976, they only made the playoffs once, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the 1970 NBA Playoffs. Before that the Suns lost a coin flip to the Milwaukee Bucks to determine the fate of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's new team prior to the 1969 NBA draft. Phoenix ultimately selected Neal Walk, who became a bust. The Suns redeemed themselves in the 1975 NBA draft by selecting Alvan Adams fourth overall.\nWith Adams fortifying the center position, and with new addition Paul Westphal and Dick Van Arsdale providing the scoring punch, the Suns reached the playoffs for only the second time, finishing with 42 wins. The Suns defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in six games of the conference semifinals, before achieving a major upset in dethroning the previous year's champions the Golden State Warriors in seven games. The Suns made it to their first NBA Finals.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Boston Celtics were seeking to make up for the lost opportunity they squandered in the 1975 NBA Playoffs. That year, they finished with 60 wins, but lost to the Washington Bullets in the conference finals. They kept the core of the team that won the 1974 NBA Finals, but made some tweaks, such as the trade of Westphal to Phoenix for Charlie Scott. The Celtics won 54 games in the 1975–76 season, then defeated the Buffalo Braves and the \"Miracle of Richfield\" Cleveland Cavaliers in six games each to reach their 14th NBA Finals. Boston was seeking its 13th NBA title.\nRegular season series.\nBoston swept the four-game regular season series.\nSeries summary.\n\"Boston Celtics defeated Phoenix Suns, 4–2\"\nGame 1.\nBoston turned back the Suns in game one behind a balanced attack. John Havlicek did not start for the Celtics due to a painful heel injury. However, Boston coach Tom Heinsohn rushed Havlicek into the game with 7:24 left in the first quarter as Phoenix took an early 10–7 lead and the Ohio State product never came back out of the game. Dave Cowens recorded a triple-double with 25 points, 21 rebounds and 10 assists while Jo Jo White shot only 1–4 from the field in the first half before making 8-of-11 shots in the second half to keep Phoenix at bay. Phoenix trailed by two at the end of the first quarter as they failed to take advantage of 11 first quarter Celtic turnovers. Kevin Stacom scored five straight points (his only points) to put Boston up for good 22–20. Charlie Scott fouled out when he picked up his fifth and sixth fouls in an 11-second span.\nGame 2.\nPhoenix lost their twelfth game in a row at Boston Garden as Boston put the game away with a 20–2 run at the start of the third quarter that gave them a 72–43 lead. The run was started by steals from Jo Jo White and Charlie Scott. Scott made just one-of-nine shots from the field in the first half but came alive with 12 points in the third quarter. Boston again started the game slowly without John Havlicek in the starting line-up, not making a field goal in the first three minutes of the game and again prompting Tommy Heinsohn to rush Havlicek into the game again.\nGame 3.\nPhoenix held Boston scoreless for nearly five minutes in the second period as they went to a 16-point lead. Then, the Suns' Ricky Sobers and Boston's Kevin Stacom got into a fistfight, and both were ejected. Sobers was having a good game at that point, and Phoenix coach John MacLeod would later accuse the Celtics of having Stacom bait Sobers into the fight in order to get him out of the game.\nThe Suns extended the lead to 23 in the third, but Boston began to charge back and cut the lead to two with three minutes left. At that point, Suns rookie center Alvan Adams scored twice, passed off to Paul Westphal for another, and then tipped in a Westphal miss moments later.\nThat was enough to get Phoenix a 105–98 win. Adams finished with 33 points and 14 rebounds. Dave Cowens and Charlie Scott both fouled out for the Celtics, and the Celtics also were whistled for two technicals.\nGame 4.\nIn the first-ever NBA game played in the month of June, referees Don Murphy and Manny Sokol whistled 21 fouls in the first 10 minutes. Celtics coach Tom Heinsohn claimed later that the affair was pure \"high school.\" John Havlicek and Cowens put the blame on their team for 'committing stupid fouls.'\nThe game was close to the end, when Ricky Sobers hit a bank shot to put the Suns up by four with 90 seconds left. The Celtics cut it to two and had a chance to tie it, but lost 109-107 when Jo Jo White missed a jump shot late.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 was a triple-overtime contest that is sometimes referred to as \"the greatest game ever played\" in NBA history. The Celtics surged out to a 36-18 lead after one quarter and led 42-20 early in the second, with John Havlicek (starting for the first time all series) scoring 19 of his team's points. The halftime lead was 61-45 Celtics, but the Suns began to claw back and held Havlicek scoreless until near the end of regulation.\nThe game was enhanced by several controversies. Two controversies involved each team's use of timeouts:\nAnother set of controversies involved the clock:\nThe most notable portion of the game was the final 20 seconds of the second overtime. Boston led at that point 109–106 (with the three-point basket not yet in existence). Phoenix had possession of the ball after taking its last timeout of the OT. In an amazing and frantic sequence, the following transpired:\nPhoenix suddenly led, 110–109, with just five seconds left, and the team looked poised to win their third straight game and grab a 3-to-2 edge in the series. John Havlicek (already of \"Havlicek Stole the Ball\" fame) responded with a drive and a leaning one-hander in traffic, that he banked in off the glass (his first basket since the first quarter), putting Boston in front 111–110 as the horn sounded. The fans then poured onto the court to celebrate Boston's apparent victory. The Celtics returned to their locker room. As CBS analyst Rick Barry passionately and correctly pointed out, the ball went through the hoop with two seconds left and the clock should have been stopped. The officials apparently agreed with Barry and ordered the Celtics back onto the floor. The game was not over.\nDuring the ensuing pandemonium, a fan attacked referee Richie Powers and other fans turned over one of the scorer's tables. After clearing the court (the fan who attacked Powers was arrested and the fans who overturned the scorer's table were ejected) and getting the Celtics back on the floor, the officials put one second back on the clock. Still, Phoenix's chances seemed slim, as they had the ball under their own basket with a second left. Then Paul Westphal of the Suns signaled for a time out that the Suns did not have. Although this resulted in a technical foul being called on Westphal, the play was critical for Phoenix, because the rules at the time gave Phoenix the same advantage (save for the technical foul shot) that they would have had with timeouts remaining to use; namely, possession of the ball at half court. Boston's Jo Jo White made the technical free throw, increasing Boston's lead to 112–110.\nDuring the timeout, fans were still on the Boston Garden floor, even disturbing the Suns' huddle by their bench as coach John MacLeod was drawing up a play for a possible tying basket. The Suns' players repeatedly had to shove the fans out of the way, and Phoenix general manager Jerry Colangelo even threatened to not bring his team back to the Boston Garden for Game 7 if security couldn't maintain control. When play resumed, Phoenix's Gar Heard took the inbounds pass from Perry and made a buzzer-beating shot (a turn-around jumper at the top of the key) for the Suns that tied the score yet again, 112–112.\nBoston eventually took a six-point lead, 128–122, late in the third overtime, as Glenn McDonald, a little-used Celtic reserve player, chipped in half a dozen. Westphal then scored the next four points for Phoenix (as part of a brilliant performance that featured several leaping, spinning, acrobatic bank shots) cutting the gap to 128–126, but he could not get the ball again; (although he very nearly did – almost stealing a pass near half court as the third overtime wound down).\nCeltics who fouled out (were disqualified due to six personal fouls) were Charlie Scott in the last minute of regulation, Dave Cowens with one minute left in the 2nd overtime, and Paul Silas in the 3rd overtime. Alvan Adams and Dennis Awtrey both fouled out for the Suns. Silas picked up his fifth foul late in the fourth quarter, but played the entire remainder, including all three overtime periods before fouling out late in the third.\nThe Suns had the lead in the game on only four occasions (twice in the second overtime) and never by more than 2 points. They led 95–94 late in the fourth, and 106–105 and 110–109 in the 2nd overtime. They also led by two points on three occasions in the third overtime.\nMcDonald scored eight points in the game, all in overtime.\nJo Jo White led all scorers with 33 points.\nPat Riley was a reserve on the Suns' bench, but never played in a game.\nGame 6.\nAfter the tough Game 5 loss, the Suns were more defiant than ever heading back home to Phoenix. \"We know we're going to beat them.\" Gar Heard declared. \"It's going to take seven now, but we know we're going to beat them. We showed we came to play.\"\nThe first half was a defensive struggle. Each team scored 20 points in the first quarter, then Boston scored 18 in the second while holding the Suns to 13. Keith Erickson, a key Suns' reserve, had attempted to play at the start of the second period, but reinjured his sprained ankle and never returned. After falling behind by 11, Phoenix caught up again in the third and took a 67–66 lead on a Ricky Sobers free throw with 7:25 left in the game.\nBut the Celtic heroes of old (Dave Cowens, John Havlicek) and new (Charlie Scott) took control from there. Havlicek hit two free throws; then Cowens stole the ball, drove, scored, drew the foul and made the foul shot for a three-point play. Cowens then scored two baskets and Havlicek another to put it away. Scott had three steals during the run and finished with 25 points and 11 rebounds, ending a series-long 11-for-44 shooting slump.\nDuring the run, Phoenix's only response was four free throws. The Celtics rode their surge to an 87–80 win and their 13th championship.\nJo Jo White scored 15 points, giving him 130 points in six games, and was named the series MVP. John Havlicek celebrated his eighth and final NBA title as a Celtic.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe 1975–76 Finals had three straight off days between Sunday afternoon opener and Thursday night second game due to CBS-TV's concern with low ratings for professional basketball. The 1975–76 network television season (as well as May sweeps) ended after Wednesday, May 26 (with weekend afternoon games not factored into the prime-time ratings). Accordingly, CBS-TV allowed Game 1 to be played on Sunday afternoon, since the ratings would not count, but would not permit Game 2 to be played live in prime time unless the NBA waited until Thursday evening.\nGame 3 started on Sunday, May 30 at 10:30 a.m. MT (1:30p.m. ET; see time in Arizona) in order for CBS to televise the final round of the PGA Tour Memorial Tournament following the game. The move angered numerous clergy in the Phoenix area, who saw drastically reduced attendance at Sunday services.\nTeam rosters.\nPhoenix Suns.\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #423189; color: #FF8800; text-align: center;\" | Phoenix Suns roster\n!

During the season, the NBA commissioned a new championship trophy, later to be renamed the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, in which the winning team would keep the trophy permanently.\nUnfortunately, the Celtics were unable to successfully defend their championship, losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the eventual conference champion Philadelphia 76ers in seven games. After that, the team began to rebuild, losing John Havlicek to retirement and then Jo Jo White to a trade within two years. Despite drafting Larry Bird in the 1978 NBA draft, Bird elected to play out his final season in college while the Celtics lost 53 games in the 1978–79 season. With Bird debuting for the 1979–80 season, the Celtics won 32 more games, but it was not until that they won another championship.\nSuns.\nThe Suns followed their unexpected run to the Finals with a losing season in 1976–77, going 34–48. After the season, Dick Van Arsdale retired, alongside twin brother Tom who became his teammate for that season. However, the team would make the playoffs the next eight seasons, going as far as the conference finals in 1979 and 1984.\nAlvan Adams remained with the Suns for the next twelve seasons, retiring after the 1987–88 season. Paul Westphal played five more seasons in Phoenix, albeit in two different stints, before becoming a coach. Westphal would coach the Suns to the finals in a losing effort. Pat Riley retired after the season and went on to win six NBA championships as a coach."

        "title": "Anchor (climbing)",
        "text": "In rock climbing, an anchor can be any device or method for attaching a climber, rope, or load to a climbing surfacetypically rock, ice, steep dirt, or a buildingeither permanently or temporarily. The intention of an anchor is case-specific but is usually for fall protection, primarily fall arrest and fall restraint. Climbing anchors are also used for hoisting, holding static loads, or redirecting (also called deviating) a rope.\nTypes.\nDepending on the surface being climbed, there are many types of protection that can be used to construct an anchor, including natural protection such as boulders and trees, or artificial protection such as cams, nuts, bolts or pitons.\nNatural.\nA natural anchor is a secure natural feature that can serve as a climbing anchor by attaching a sling, lanyard, or cordelette and a carabiner. Examples of natural anchors include trees, boulders, lodged chockstones, horns, icicles, and protrusions.\nArtificial.\nAn artificial anchor consists of man-made climbing gear placed in the rock. Such gear includes spring-loaded camming devices, aluminum nuts used like chockstones, steel expansion bolts, and pitons. Artificial anchors may be permanent or removable.\nBelay.\nA belay anchor is used as a sole attachment to the cliff face, to support a belay or top rope. Ideally, it should consist of multiple redundant components (natural and/or artificial), none of which are likely to fail, and none of which in the event of failure would cause the entire anchor to fail. Any component of a good anchor should be able to support the entire system by itself.\nRunning belay.\nA running belay anchor is used as a safeguard in the event of a fall while lead climbing. The leader and follower climb simultaneously with protection placed in between. When the two climbers advance using a running belay, the belay is almost as secure as using a belay device and anchors because if the leader falls, all the slack is already out of the rope and the follower acts as a counterweight to catch the fall. A running belay is used as a faster alternative to pitch-climbing when the risk, consequences, and likelihood of a leader fall are deemed to be acceptable.\nIce.\nThe snow picket is used as an anchor in mountaineering. It is driven into the snow and used to arrest falls. Snow pickets can also be placed horizontally in snow as a deadman, which provides a secure anchor to abseil on. Ice screws can be hand-driven into solid ice and are the equivalent of cams or nuts when ice climbing. Ice can also be protected using an Abalakov thread or v-thread. Because of the uncertain holding power of ice protection, it is sometimes attached to the rope using a load-absorbing sling or quickdraw, designed to reduce the load on protection by extending in case of a fall.\nAttaching.\nIndirect.\nWhen the rope goes from the climber to the belayer. Most often used under controlled circumstances at climbing walls or when the climber doesn't have the weight advantage on the belayer during bottom-roped climbs. It is impossible to escape from the system.\nSemi-direct.\nWhen the rope comes from the climber to the belayer, the belayer is attached separately to an anchor. Often used when multi-pitching and the belayer is on a stance. Or when top roping and it is possible that if the climber falls the belayer will be pulled from the stance above the climber. The belayer can, with a little effort then remove themselves from the system if required.\nIt is essential that the belayer is attached to the anchor via the belay loop at the front of the harness. Attaching the harness of the belayer to the anchor via the back of the harness can cause the harness, when placed under strain, to constrict inwards elongating front to back, rather than side to side. This can result in a crushed pelvis and serious harm to the belayer.\nDirect.\nWhen the rope comes from the climber to an anchor. A hanging belay device may be used, although it is common in this instance to just use an Italian hitch. The belayer is totally free of the system.\nConsiderations.\nForce-multipliers.\nThe force on an anchor may be much greater than the weight of the climber. There are various mechanisms that contribute to excess force, including\nLoad-sharing.\nA load-sharing (or load-distributing) anchor is a system consisting of two or more individual anchors which join together at a main anchor point to form an anchoring system. This configuration is a way to introduce redundancy and increase strength, typically for a belay anchor. If assembled correctly, the load will be distributed to each individual anchor, rather than placing all the load on a single anchor point. This decreases the chance that any single anchor point will fail, and, if a point does fail, the other(s) should still be able to hold.\nBest practices.\nTo ensure proper redundancy and effectiveness of a load-sharing anchor, some best practices are commonly observed.\nRedundancy.\nAnchors should be redundant, meaning that the overall anchor will still be sufficiently strong if any individual anchor were to fail. Selecting \"independent\" locations for the individual anchors would make an anchor redundant. This may mean using distinct boulders, crack systems, or objects for the placement location of each individual anchor. That being said, redundancy is not necessary in all climbing anchors. A living tree that is at least in diameter will surely hold up several kilonewtons of force in any direction, and so is sufficient as being the sole anchor for any climbing anchor. \nEqualization.\nIn a load-sharing anchor, each individual anchor is connected to a main anchor point. The load-sharing anchor is said to be \"equalized\" if the load force is distributed equally to each individual anchor. This is accomplished by adjusting the length of each connecting member (between the main anchor point and an individual anchor) while pulling the main anchor in the anticipated direction of the load. Anchors can be either pre-equalized, in which the anchor is statically equalized between anchor points during rigging, or self-equalizing, in which the anchor system dynamically adjusts tension between anchor points during use.\nNon-extension.\nA load-sharing anchor which does not extend in the event of an individual anchor failure has the property of non-extension. This important feature reduces the potential for shock-loading the remaining individual anchors during a failure. Non-extension can be accomplished by tying an appropriate knot in the interconnecting cordelette, or by using individual slings for equalization. The principle of non-extension refers to the mitigation of shock-loading, rather than the elongation of materials under an increased load. \nThe principle of minimum swing is related to non-extension. The main anchor point in a well-constructed load-sharing anchor will neither extend nor swing in the event of an individual anchor failure. Reducing swing can be accomplished by minimizing the inner angle between individual anchors, and by increasing the number of individual anchors. An additional technique is to place a directional anchor a short distance below the main anchor point.\nInner angle.\nWhen constructing a load-sharing anchor, it is important to take into consideration the angle formed between each individual anchor – the \"V-angle\". Climbers typically try to minimize this angle, because a greater V-angle will produce more force at each individual anchor. \nIf the V-angle is greater than 120 degrees, the load on each individual anchor will be greater than the load on the rope. Angles in excess of 120 degrees can create a hazardous situation that compromises the safety of the anchor, and should generally be avoided.\nThe sum of forces on all the individual anchors will commonly exceed 100%, and in some cases, the force on an individual anchor will be greater than the load. This may seem contradictory when only the magnitudes are summed. However, if the forces on the individual anchors are added as vectors, the resultant force on the anchor system is equal to the load. In simpler terms, the forces in the \"vertical\" direction are equal to the load force, but there are lateral forces as well – which increase as the V-angle increases.\nThe force on \"each\" individual anchor is given by:\nwhere,\nThis equation is a special case representation of the more general anchor force equation, in which the load-sharing anchor is constructed from two symmetrically placed anchors.\nFrom this expression, the anchor forces can be calculated for selected angles in a two-element, symmetrical, load-sharing anchor.\nIn trad climbing belay stations, load-sharing anchors are often constructed from more than two individual anchors, which are rarely co-planar. In these cases, each individual anchor would feel a reduced force from the above values, but the best practice is to reduce the angle between the two outermost elements and avoid angles in excess of 120 degrees."

        "title": "Luke Bailey (rugby league)",
        "text": "Luke Bailey (born 5 January 1980) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s and 2010s. An Australia national and New South Wales State of Origin representative front row forward, he played his club football in the National Rugby League for the St. George Illawarra Dragons before signing with the Gold Coast Titans for their debut season in the NRL in 2007. \nBailey was originally a junior of the Shellharbour Sharks club before signing for the Illawarra Steelers as a teenager prior to their joint venture with the St. George Dragons in 1999. After debuting in 2000 he went on to make a further one hundred and nineteen appearances for St. George Illawarra before becoming newly formed National Rugby League franchise Gold Coast Titans' second signing for their inaugural 2007 season. Bailey and Scott Prince were named as co-captains. Bailey was the first person to score a try on Skilled Park at the Gold Coast.\nBackground.\nBailey was born on 5 January 1980 in Port Kembla, New South Wales. Initially a junior soccer player, he started to play rugby league at a junior level for the Shellharbour Sharks at the age of twelve. His talent was quickly noticed and while still an adolescent was signed to a junior development deal with Australian Rugby League club the Illawarra Steelers. While attending Warilla High School, Bailey played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1997. At the completion of the 1998 season the Illawarra club was forced to form a joint venture with the St. George Dragons and Bailey's contract was renewed with the newly formed entity, the St. George Illawarra Dragons.\nProfessional playing career.\nSt George Illawarra Dragons.\nAfter playing a sole season of lower grade rugby league with St. George Illawarra, Bailey had impressed the club's top tier coaches enough to earn a spot on the bench for the Dragons' 2000 NRL season opener against local rivals the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks; a game they would eventually lose twenty-eight to twelve. The 20-year-old made another two consecutive appearances from the bench but after a 0–24 defeat by the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs he was dropped for their round four clash with the Northern Eagles.\nBailey remained in the lower grades at St. George Illawarra before earning a recall to the first grade side against the Wests Tigers in round six and a week later was given his first starting berth by coach David Waite. After an impressive performance during the team's win against the Auckland Warriors during his first start Bailey remained a staple fixture in the starting line-up, playing in every remaining season fixture and cementing his starting position in the club's line-up.\nAfter an impressive first year, Bailey began the 2001 NRL season in a starting spot in the front row. He appeared in the Dragon's first four appearances of the season but tore a pectoral muscle during the team's loss to the Warriors, an injury which ruled him out for the rest of the season.\nThe beginning of the 2002 season saw Bailey recover fully from the injury that had prematurely ended his previous playing year and while he missed all of the club's trials including the Charity Shield fixture against South Sydney he made his return to the team for their opening round clash against Cronulla-Sutherland and would go on to appear in a further twenty consecutive appearances putting in several man of the match performances and along the way earning himself a call up to the New South Wales State of Origin side. Bailey made his State of Origin debut for the New South Wales Blues in game I of the 2002 series. He featured in the run-on side in all three games of that drawn series. During the Dragons round twenty-one loss to the Newcastle Knights Bailey found himself being severely reprimanded for the first time in his short career after opposing forward Josh Perry had claimed Bailey had bitten him on the forearm before withdrawing the allegation moments later. The seriousness of the allegation and the media frenzy that followed however saw Bailey being called up to face the NRL Judiciary however he was later cleared of any wrongdoing.\nFive weeks later when St. George Illawarra again took on the Newcastle side the spotlight was again on Bailey for a disciplinary issue with Newcastle coach Michael Hagan claiming that a tackle from him had injured Newcastle captain Andrew Johns and ended his season, however he was not charged over the incident.\n2003 started well for the St. George club with six victories from their first eight games. Bailey would receive his first call up for the Australian national side during the 2003 season where after some impressive performances he would play his first game during the 2003 Anzac test against the New Zealand national side. However Bailey injured his back during a fixture against the Penrith Panthers and was left with a severe lower back strain after being cleared of a suspected fractured vertebra. This injury became a somewhat re-occurring one and hampered his season keeping him out of several matches throughout the year. In 2003 he again made three appearances for the Blues – all as an impact player coming off the interchange bench. He was Man of the Match in game I of the 2003 State of Origin series. Further injury at the completion of the year ruled Bailey out of the Australian national side for their end of season Northern hemisphere tour after he required surgery to fix a damaged ear.\nAfter missing the Australian tour and having his first full off-season of training under his belt since 2002 meant that Bailey would play in St. George's trial matches that year including their 34 – 8 victory in Charity Shield against South Sydney. However the actual season did not start as positively with Bailey being placed on report for a dangerous tackle in the season opener against the Canberra Raiders and then subsequently being charged and forced to miss the round two clash with the Warriors. Bailey returned from suspension a week later in the Dragons loss to the Melbourne Storm and then went on to play the next few rounds for the Dragons with several strong performances earning him an Australian call up. Bailey earned his second international cap when he was selected to play for Australia from the interchange benh in the 2004 ANZAC Test match against the Kiwis but not make another appearance for a few years. Though injury again hampered him during a regular season fixture against the Manly club in round nine where Bailey re-injured his pectoral muscle as he had also done in 2001 which meant he was in for another lengthy stay on the sidelines being ruled out for the entire regular season. A torn pectoral muscle in 2004 saw his season disrupted and he took no part in Origin that year. He eventually made his return during the final series but not even his presence could help St. George Illawarra from narrowly losing to the Penrith Panthers.\n2005 looked a promising one for both the club and Bailey, who started the season without any injury or suspension clouds hanging over his head. A promising start to the season would continue for the club helped by lack of injuries to key players including 'Bull' Bailey who would go on to make a total of twenty-three appearances for the club guiding them to equal top position of the ladder after all regular season games sitting just behind Parramatta on points difference. On 23 June 2005; it was announced that the newly formed Gold Coast Titans club was chasing the signature of Bailey for its inaugural 2007 season. It was confirmed later that month that he had signed a three-year deal with the club beginning with the first Titans season and finishing in 2009. Bailey appeared in all three games of the 2005 State of Origin series. The 2005 finals series saw Bailey put in an impressive performance in a tough game against Cronulla but all would be in vain as the St. George club would eventually lose in the preliminary finals to eventual winners the Wests Tigers.\nBailey played for the Blues in games II and III in 2006 State of Origin series. Bailey played his last season for St George Illawarra in 2006.\nGold Coast Titans.\nAfter joining the Gold Coast club Bailey was heralded as the rock on which the Titans forwards relied to start their debut season as possibly best they could and while the club would end up losing its first match by two points to his previous club the St. George Illawarra Dragons they would start the season with a 3 and 2 win–loss record.\nBailey was selected to play for the Australian national team from the interchange bench in the 2007 ANZAC Test match victory against New Zealand.\nBailey played for the Blues in all three games of the 2007 State of Origin series off the interchange bench. By the end of the Origin series of 2007 he had made fourteen appearances, eight off the bench. At the end of the Titans' first season he was named co-winner of the club's inaugural Paul Broughton Medal for best and fairest player of the season with teammate Anthony Laffranchi. He scored the first try for the Titans at Skilled Park in the 2008 Opener.\nHe was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009.\nIn May 2009, Bailey was named in the 17-man squad to represent New South Wales in the opening State of Origin match on 3 June 2009, in Melbourne. In the 2009 NRL season, Bailey played in the Gold Coast's first finals campaign.\nAfter playing in the Titans' last few matches of the 2010 NRL season with a broken thumb, Bailey was awarded the Paul Broughton Medal for the club's player of the year again. Bailey played for the Gold Coast in their 2010 preliminary final defeat against the Sydney Roosters at Suncorp Stadium which ended the Gold Coast's best season since entering the competition.\nIn the 2011 NRL season, Bailey made 21 appearances as the Gold Coast finished last on the table and claimed the wooden spoon.\nOn 1 September 2014 Bailey announced his retirement from Rugby League. He was one of two of the Titans' foundation players alongside the departing Mark Minichiello who'd remained with the Titans since their inaugural year in 2007."

The last running of the event at Aqueduct in 1967 is one of the more notable when Poker defeated champions Assagai and his own stablemate, the 1966 US Horse of the Year, Buckpasser who was entering the race with a fifteen race winning streak.\nThe 1970 winner Fort Marcy would later that year be crowned US Horse of the Year and the 1972 winner Run the Gantlet was the 1971 US Champion Male Turf Horse.\nIn 1973 the event was classified as Grade II and for several years in the late 1980s the event held Grade I status.\nIn winning the Bowling Green Handicap on 17 June 1990 at Belmont Park, the 1989 Canadian champion With Approval set a new World Record of 2:10 for miles on turf. As of today, the record remains unmatched.\nThe 2008 edition was replaced in its summer spot by the Man o' War Stakes.

        "text": "The Sri Lanka national cricket team toured India for cricket matches in October, November and December 2005. The tour was split into two legs, as India hosted South Africa for a One Day International series in between the India–Sri Lanka ODIs (which were played between 25 October and 12 November) and the Tests, which took place in December. Before the ODI series, India were ranked seventh on the ICC ODI Championship table, while Sri Lanka were second, and the Indian team had officially changed captains with Rahul Dravid taking over from Sourav Ganguly. However, India defied the rankings, winning the first four ODIs of seven to secure the series, and ended up with a 6–1 win despite resting captain Dravid and letting opener Virender Sehwag take over the helm for the sixth ODI. Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka's opener with 100 Tests and 345 ODIs, was dropped for the Tests after tallying 86 runs in the six ODIs, while Rahul Dravid moved up 18 places on the ICC player rankings with 312 runs for twice out. India's wicket-keeper MS Dhoni also made his mark, being the second highest averaging batsman of the series, and he made 183 not out in 3rd ODI matches at Jaipur, which was at the time the sixth-highest innings by a batsman in an ODI.\nThe Test series was won by India as well, this time 2–0, with three and a half days of play of the first Test lost due to rain. In the second Test, India took a 60-run lead on first innings after Anil Kumble took six for 72, and four half-centuries (from Irfan Pathan, Yuvraj Singh, Rahul Dravid and MS Dhoni) gave India 375 more runs before declaring. Kumble then completed a ten-for in the match as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 247, losing by 188 runs. In the second match, the margin of victory was even more convincing, Kumble getting seven wickets and Harbhajan Singh ten as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 206 and 249 on their way to a 259-run loss.\nSquads.\nFor the sixth and seventh ODI matches Venugopal Rao and JP Yadav was originally replaced by Mohammad Kaif and V. R. V. Singh V. R. V. Singh failed a fitness test and Yadav was called up again.[3]\nGanguly was replaced by Wasim Jaffer for the third Test.[5]\nChamara Kapugedera was originally selected for the Test squad, but suffered a lateral ligament and was replaced by Mubarak.[4]"

        "text": "The South African cricket team toured Australia for cricket matches during the 2005–06 season. South Africa had already played two One Day International series during this season, beating New Zealand 4–0 at home before travelling to India and drawing the series there 2–2. The team had been playing 14 successive ODIs (tour matches excluded) before arriving in Australia, with their last Test match against West Indies in April and May 2005. South Africa played one first class warm-up match, one three-day warm-up match without first class status, and one one-day match before they embarked on the three-Test series, which began on 16 December and ended on 6 January. They also participated in the 2005–06 VB Series, a three-team one-day tournament, along with Australia and Sri Lanka, where they finished last.\nThe hosts Australia, meanwhile, came off a win in the Frank Worrell Trophy Test series against West Indies in November, where they won all three matches in the series. They also spent a week in New Zealand playing three ODIs for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy while South Africa played their first warm-up games; Australia won that trophy after winning two of the three ODIs.\nSouth Africa started with a draw, batting out 126 overs in the fourth innings to draw the match at the WACA, though they finished on a total of five for 287, well short of the winning target of 491. In the second Test match, South Africa trailed by 44 on first innings, but a century from Matthew Hayden took Australia to a lead of 365 before declaring, and Shane Warne took four wickets in the second innings as Australia bowled their way to a 184-run win. South Africa came back to earn a lead of 92 on first innings in the third Test at the SCG, but after 70 fourth-day overs were lost due to rain South Africa declared in the first session of the fifth day to give themselves a chance of victory and a series win. However, Ricky Ponting hit 143 not out to become the first batsman to hit centuries in both innings of his 100th Test, and in the process took Australia past the winning target to secure a 2–0 win.\nTour matches.\nWestern Australia v South Africans, 5 December–7 December.\nWestern Australia beat the South Africans by an innings and 48 runs\nSouth Africa began their tour on 5 December, 11 days before the first Test match, with a three-day tour match against Western Australia, who were still without a win in the first class form of the game. However, an elbow injury to Jacques Kallis and a finger injury to Graeme Smith weakened the tourists' batting, and Adam Voges hit 101 for Western Australia, putting on 156 in 43.2 overs with Marcus North. Western Australia were three for 73 at lunch after André Nel, Shaun Pollock and Charl Langeveldt had grabbed a wicket each, but Nel and Langeveldt were both taken for four runs an over, with only Langeveldt getting any further wickets, to end with four for 104. Nicky Boje also got one wicket before Justin Langer declared the innings closed on eight for 391. South Africa added 71 in the first 21 overs, but first class debutant Shawn Gillies, born in Jamaica, then had two wickets in his first over in first class cricket. Cricket Australia's report described Gillies' bowling as \"continually troubling the batsmen\". Ben Edmondson then took the next three wickets either side of the tea break, and spinner Beau Casson rounded it off with four wickets, leaving South Africa all out for 179. Following on 212 behind, South Africa's batsmen yielded eight catches, with three wickets falling in six overs after lunch on day three, and Ashwell Prince's 49 remained their top score thus far on tour as they were bowled out for 164 in the second innings. Beau Casson took another four-wicket-haul, ending with eight wickets for the match (though number five Justin Kemp was his highest-batting victim), while Steve Magoffin ended with three for 37. Gillies was only called upon to bowl four overs, conceding 17 without taking a wicket, as Western Australia recorded their first first-class win of the season. Graeme Smith, South Africa's captain, claimed that he did not think the result was \"a concern\", and was confident his side would do \"the hard work going into the first Test\".\nCricket Australia Chairman's XI v South Africans, 9 December.\nSouth Africans beat Cricket Australia Chairman's XI by eight wickets\nWestern Australia XI v South Africans, 11 December–13 December.\nWestern Australia XI drew with South Africans\nThe third match of the South Africans' tour was also against Western Australia, but this time against a team containing only two of the players they had played the previous week, and none of the players that had players the Warriors' recent Pura Cup game. Yet, the Western Australia team outscored them on first innings after 145 from 20-year-old Luke Pomersbach, which gave them a lead of eight before declaring. Jacques Rudolph then made a double ton for the South Africans, who scored 395 runs despite four wickets from Matthew Petrie, and Western Australia lost one wicket in reply before time ran out and the match ended in a draw.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAfter three warm-up matches, with one win, one draw and one loss, the South African team was ready for the top-ranked Australians, though they had to make do without Jacques Kallis. After the early wicket of Matthew Hayden who mis-timed a shot to Jacques Rudolph in the gully on his second ball, Australia batted to lunch with no further loss, and having added 96 in the first 26 overs before lunch they continued with 15 in four overs after it – before Justin Langer top edged a shot to Graeme Smith, and Makhaya Ntini had his second wicket.\nHe was to get more – after Shaun Pollock had removed Ricky Ponting lbw for 71, Brad Hodge and Mike Hussey batted together until tea, with the score on three for 175. But Ntini took three wickets with thirteen balls, had Hodge, Hussey and Adam Gilchrist all caught, and despite a stand of 33 between Shane Warne and Brett Lee, Australia were bowled out for 258 after André Nel took a brace including Nathan Bracken and Glenn McGrath in the 76th over.\nSouth Africa batted for seven overs before stumps on day one, and Brett Lee was taken out of the attack after two of them, having conceded 15 with two no-balls; he came back to bowl 20.2 overs on the second day, more than any bowler bar Shane Warne, and got five wickets on the day, his sixth career five-wicket-haul. Cricinfo journalist Siddartha Vaidyanathan claimed that the \"pendulum [of control in the game] oscillated to and fro\" on the second day, as South Africa first cut 55 runs off the target in 12.3 overs, before a wide one from Bracken found the edge of Graeme Smith's bat and went to the hand of Ponting at second slip for 34.\nThe next 14 overs saw slower scoring, as de Villiers and Gibbs put on 44, before Gibbs inside edged for 21. It was Gibbs' fifth innings at number three in the order, and he has still not passed 50 at this position. None of the following three batsmen in the order managed to pass 30, either, and Jacques Rudolph and Justin Kemp came and went in single figures to see South Africa were six for 185, and still needed 73 for a first-innings lead.\nThose runs were taken by Shaun Pollock and Mark Boucher, who put on 77 together in a stand described as \"sizzling\" by Vaidyanathan – the two hit six fours in four overs after tea, before Lee returned to have Pollock bowled off the inside edge. Boucher put on 18 in the next half-hour with André Nel, and Makhaya Ntini hit 12 from ten balls as South Africa closed on 296, with a lead of 38. Those runs were exactly matched by Australia, but once again Hayden was dismissed for a sub-25 score, as he top edged to wicket-keeper Boucher for 20. Brett Lee was left as nightwatchman, and Langeveldt bowled a no-ball to level the scores two balls before the end of the day.\nAustralia's middle order performed much better in the second innings than in the first, however. After Lee had been dismissed for 32, Australia were two for 86, and after Ponting survived a catch off a ball that was incorrectly deemed a no-ball according to TV replays, Ponting made his way to 53, and by tea Australia were four for 185 with Hussey and Hodge at the crease.\nHodge, in his third test, who had contributed with a two-hour 41 in the first innings, survived a dropped catch on 13 – and never looked back. He added an unbroken 126 with Hussey before stumps on day three, made his century off 198 balls on the fourth morning despite Hussey departing in the second over of the day, and took a further 134 balls to make it a double. Ponting then declared, and tea was taken with an Australian total of eight for 528 – which set a target of 491 for South Africa, which would have been a world record chase. With both openers out before the end of the fourth day, South Africa needed a further 406 runs to win for their last eight wickets.\nWith a victory out of the question, South Africa entered the fifth day with only one objective: survival. The Proteas' remaining eight batsmen would have to bat out ninety overs in over six hours. Gibbs was dismissed 12 overs into the morning session, caught low-down at slip by Warne off the bowling of Brett Lee for 33, and just before the luncheon interval Ashwell Prince was also dismissed after an innings lasting 55 minutes and yielding eight runs. Warne was the perpetrator, and he got his fifth wicket for the match as South Africa went into lunch with the score at four for 140.\nHowever, the afternoon session brought no wickets to Australia, as Jacques Rudolph and Justin Kemp scored 50 runs in a session lasting 28 overs. Rudolph, Kallis' replacement, bought up his half-century during this time, his 50 coming off 150 deliveries, and South Africa were four for 190 at tea, with only about thirty overs until the close of play. Australia needed a wicket every five overs, but instead, they only got one in the whole session; the 112-run partnership between Rudolph and Kemp was broken late in the final session, Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne combining to dismiss Kemp for 55 (166 balls, 213 minutes). With only a handful of overs remaining, Rudolph brought up a century, his 102 coming from 283 balls and 431 minutes. Rudolph and Mark Boucher batted out the remaining overs, and Australia and South Africa would go into Melbourne's Boxing Day Test with the series level at 0–0. The \"Melbourne Herald Sun\" claimed in their post-match report that the Australian captain Ponting \"was dealing with one of the biggest blunders of his career\", after Australia failed to win the match, and that Terry Alderman accused Ponting of \"a lack of imagination\".\n2nd Test.\nJustin Kemp failed a fitness test before the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, while Jacques Kallis recovered from an elbow injury and would take Kemp's place. For Australia, Phil Jaques made his debut, replacing the injured Justin Langer. Spin bowler Stuart MacGill also replaced pacer Nathan Bracken. However, after Australia's captain Ponting had won the toss and set Jaques in to bat with Matthew Hayden, Shaun Pollock got a breakthrough in the third over by having Jaques caught at short leg, and Ponting had to start batting in the fourth over. South Africa could have had another wicket three balls later, as Ponting edged through the spread-out slips cordon, and Ponting was also dropped on 17 by André Nel.\nPonting and Hayden batted until lunch, however, adding 58 in 17 overs before the break was taken, and a further 37 overs was played in the afternoon session. Through 34 of them, Australia lost no further wicket, before Hayden edged a ball from Pollock to Graeme Smith at slip for 65. Pollock got one further wicket on the day, removing Brad Hodge for 7 with the score at three for 176, but Ponting stuck in, getting his 26th Test century in the 68th over. He pushed on to 117 before he was caught off Nel, who paid back for his dropped catch with four wickets in eight overs; he also got Andrew Symonds for a duck, Adam Gilchrist for two and Shane Warne for nine. Makhaya Ntini then ended the day five balls before the scheduled minimum of 90 overs by having Brett Lee lbw on four, which left Mike Hussey not out on 23 overnight with Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath (both with Test batting averages below 10) yet to bat.\nOn the second morning, MacGill came in to bat with Hussey, and departed in the third over having made four. McGrath was more stubborn, however, totalling 11 not out in his 28-over, 107-run stand with Hussey, who batted until lunch and made 122. The stand of 107 was an Australian tenth-wicket record in Tests against South Africa. South Africa then batted out the day, scoring 169 in 58 overs with both AB de Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs completing half-centuries, while Andrew Symonds bowled the most overs of the three spinners with 13.\nOn the third day, Brett Lee took two South African middle-order wickets, getting Kallis and Rudolph bowled before Mark Boucher settled in with the top-scorer of the innings, Gibbs. The two batted together for 11 overs, but Symonds removed them both within three overs before getting Shaun Pollock lbw for 9. His seven-over spell yielded three wickets, and spinners Warne and MacGill took care of the last batsmen as South Africa were bowled out for 311. Australia closed the third day on two for 110, with Matthew Hayden on 45, and he continued onto his century on the fourth day.\nHayden and Hussey shared a stand of 62 in 23 overs after Hodge was dismissed early on, but when Graeme Smith had Hussey caught, Hayden and Symonds hit out. Symonds hit a six with his third ball, a straight loft, and the pair hit eight sixes and 124 runs in 85 balls. Jacques Kallis then had three men caught in an over with the new ball, and Australia declared with a lead of 365. Symonds continued on his efforts with the bat, and according to Cricinfo journalist Anand Vasu, he lifted \"Australia to within a dreadlock's breadth of victory\". After Smith, de Villiers and Gibbs had been dismissed by the experienced bowlers of Warne and McGrath, South Africa were three for 58, and needed a rebuilding effort from Kallis and Ashwell Prince. However, after 39 minutes of batting, Kallis dabbled at a ball outside off, and the ball caught the edge and went into Gilchrist's hands to leave South Africa four down. Symonds got a further wicket, ending with 4–2–6–2, and another wicket fell before the close of play, as Australia needed four more wickets on the fifth day for victory. South Africa, meanwhile, needed 267 runs.\nSouth Africa lasted a little more than a session, with Shaun Pollock batting for two and a half hours in a futile attempt to save the draw. However, Ashwell Prince departed just before the drinks break, dismissed by Warne for the fourth time in the series, and Boje held out for an hour before edging a ball from McGrath onto his stumps for 13. One over after lunch, it was all over, with Makhaya Ntini bowled by MacGill as South Africa were all out for 181, losing by 184 runs and going 0–1 down before the third and final Test in Sydney.\n3rd Test.\nSouth Africa batted first at the SCG after winning the toss, in conditions that were \"ideal for seam bowling\" according to Cricinfo journalist S Rajesh. No play was possibly before lunch due to drizzle, and when play started overhead conditions were cloudy and the pitch was visibly green. It enabled Australia to take three wickets in the first session, with AB de Villiers caught behind for two in the sixth over off Brett Lee. Lee was also able to grab Graeme Smith, leaving South Africa at three for 86, but Ashwell Prince and Jacques Kallis batted out the six overs until the tea break, before enjoying conditions that \"gradually became batsman-friendly\". The two put on 146 unbeaten runs on the first day to take South Africa to three for 230 at stumps.\nThough Brett Lee opened the second day's play with what was described as a \"torrid spell\", where he had the batsmen beaten and hit on the body, and even had a \"legitimate lbw shout\" against Kallis when on 85. Kallis went on to make 111 before he was caught off the bowling of Symonds (his only wicket of the innings), while his batting partner, Prince, registered his third Test century before he was given out for 119 to a ball that \"would have missed off\". Prince and Kallis' partnership was a South African fourth-wicket record against Australia, while Australia's slow bowlers, Warne and MacGill, ended with a combined analysis of three wickets for 208. In the final session of the day, Shaun Pollock and Test debutant Johan Botha (who had come in for the injured Ntini) put on 49 for the eighth wicket to take South Africa past 400, and they eventually declared on nine for 451. Then, the last hour of the second day yielded three wickets, with Langer and Hayden inside edging Langeveldt to be bowled before the last ball of the day was fended to short leg to see Hodge out for 6. Australia were three for 54, still 397 behind.\nOn the third day, a century from Ponting and late hitting from Gilchrist helped Australia to limit the deficit and prevent the follow on, but they were still behind on first innings. An hour's play was lost due to rain, but when it did start Ponting and Hussey batted together for two and a half hours, adding 130 before Botha got his first Test wicket when a straighter ball from the spinner had Hussey caught behind. The Cricinfo report claimed that Hussey was \"extremely lucky to survive an lbw shout on 9 off Nel\", but he did go on to make 45; Ponting was on 97 when the partnership was broken, and brought up the century with a flick wide of mid-on. He thus became the sixth man to score a century in his 100th Test.\nJust before tea, South Africa took three wickets for four runs, with Ponting (lbw to Kallis 120), Symonds (lbw to Nel 12) and Warne (caught behind off Nel for a golden duck) out, and Australia were seven for 226, trailing by 225 and with Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee at the crease. Lee left after an 11-over stand with Gilchrist which had yielded 37 runs, but Stuart MacGill upped the ante with Gilchrist, and the pair hit at more than five an over in a ninth-wicket partnership worth 59. When MacGill went for 29 off 21 balls, Gilchrist then shielded McGrath from the strike, as the No. 11 faced twelve balls in his half-hour innings worth one run, and though Gilchrist eventually gloved a ball to the keeper, he had made 86 runs and helped cut the deficit to 92.\nSouth Africa started their innings with four runs off McGrath's first over, but in the next over de Villiers became Lee's victim once again; in the first innings, he had been caught behind for two, now he was lbw for 1. The South African opener thus saw his average fall by seven runs during this series, after his three single-figure scores in the six innings.\nThe fourth day saw 70 overs of play lost due to rain, and though Gibbs hit 67 off 74 balls before he was run out by Hodge, South Africa's other batsmen could only add 23 in the 20.3 overs of play. Smith had been given lbw in the second over of the morning, though it was suggested that the ball \"would have sailed over the stumps\". Gibbs and Kallis then added 86 in 19 overs during showers, and shortly afterwards an early tea break was taken; the players never returned on the fourth day.\nSouth Africa batted for 20 more overs on the fifth day before declaring, with the total on six for 194 after Kallis had got his half-century and Pollock added 26 not out in a 42-run seventh-wicket stand with Kallis. The declaration was described as \"extremely sporting\" by the Cricinfo reporter. Australia were left to chase 287 in 76 overs, and though Langer was dismissed four balls before lunch was taken, South Africa got only one more wicket. Captain Ponting took over from Langer, and accumulated runs on both sides of the wicket, ending his innings with a strike rate of 90. His strokeplay was described as \"delectable\", and in the two sessions post-lunch, South Africa could not get him out. His century was brought up shortly after tea, and as he was supported by Hayden, who hit 90 in a 182-run second-wicket partnership, Ponting could guide Australia to a 2–0 win margin. With 143 not out, he also became the first batsman to hit two centuries in his 100th Test. For his efforts, Ponting was named both Man of the Match, and Man of the Series after his 515 runs at a batting average of 103.\nT20I series.\nOnly T20I.\nGarnett Kruger got his international debut in what was South Africa's second Twenty20 international, and turned out to be their fifth loss on tour, as they barely made 50% of Australia's score. The crowd of 38,894 was a record for any sporting event at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, and they got to watch the home side put out \"an utterly convincing and breathtaking performance\" according to the Cricinfo report. Australia opened the batting with James Hopes and Damien Martyn, and after Hopes was out having made 17 in a 57-run first-wicket partnership, Martyn and Ponting continued. Ponting was caught off Johan Botha for 27, in the spinners' first over, but in the next over Martyn brought up his fifty, and with Symonds hitting a half-century as well, Australia closed on 3 for 209, with Symonds hitting 20 off Monde Zondeki with the last five balls of the last over. Martyn was out with the first ball of that over, hitting to Gibbs at point for 96, four short of the first century in Twenty20 International cricket.\nSouth Africa lost Boeta Dippenaar and Gibbs in the third over, with Nathan Bracken's opening spell yielding both to end with bowling figures of 3–0–9–2. Hopes then got the wicket of Smith, who had been out for 22, and that was to be the third-highest score of the innings. Boucher made 29 and Pollock 24, but by the end of the fourteenth over they were both out, with the score six for 92. Mick Lewis got the last two wickets of Kruger and Zondeki to end the match in the nineteenth over, with South Africa bowled out for 114; all five bowlers got a wicket, though the Cricinfo reporter claimed that the fall of wickets was \"not so much due to tight bowling as outrageously slick fielding and catching\"\nOne-day Internationals.\nSouth Africa failed to make the final of the VB Series, being knocked out by Sri Lanka after losing the final game by 76 runs.\nTour itinerary.\n\"Warm-up matches marked 'W'.

        "text": "The Boxing Day Test match is a cricket Test match held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, involving the Australian cricket team and an opposing national team that is touring Australia during the southern summer. It begins annually on Boxing Day (26 December) and is played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\nHistory.\nBy long tradition, a Sheffield Shield match between Victoria and New South Wales had been played at the MCG over the Christmas period dating back as far as 1865. It included Boxing Day as one of the scheduled days of play, much to the chagrin of the NSW players who missed spending Christmas with their families as a result. The Melbourne Test was usually held over the New Year period, often starting on 1 January.\nDuring the 1950–51 Ashes series, the Melbourne Test was played from 22 to 27 December, with the fourth day's play being on Boxing Day, but no test matches were played on Boxing Day in Melbourne between 1953 and 1967. Because there were six Tests in the 1974–75 Ashes series, in order to fit them all in to the overall schedule, the Third Test at Melbourne was scheduled to start on Boxing Day. \nThat was the origin of the modern tradition, although it was not until 1980 that it was formalised by the Australian Cricket Board, alongside the recent acquisition of its television rights by the Nine Network, and Melbourne emphasising its hosting of major sporting events (such as the AFL Grand Final and Australian Open) to offset the decline of its manufacturing industry.\nThe Boxing Day Test has cultural significance and often draws large crowds, although increased competition from Twenty20 fixtures in the Big Bash League has led to variances in attendance; the MCG hosted its largest Boxing Day crowd in 2013, the fourth Test of the 2013–14 Ashes series against England. \nIndividual awards.\nSince 1975, there has been an official Player of the Match named in each Boxing Day Test. Since 2020, the man of the match has received the Mullagh Medal, named in honour of Indigenous Australian cricketer Johnny Mullagh."

        "title": "1978 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1978 Tour de France was the 65th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 29 June and 23 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of .\nThe 1978 Tour had a high-profile doping case when Michel Pollentier was caught in an attempt to cheat the doping test, after he had won the 16th stage to Alpe d'Huez, and had taken the lead in the general classification. Pollentier left the race, and the overall victory became a battle between Joop Zoetemelk and Bernard Hinault. In the end, it was won by debutant Bernard Hinault, for the first of his five victories. The points classification was won by Freddy Maertens, and the mountains classification by Mariano Martínez.\nTeams.\nThe 1978 Tour started with 11 teams, each sent 10 cyclists, a total of 110.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nSince the 1977 Tour de France, dominant riders as Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Raymond Poulidor and Luis Ocaña had retired. Lucien Van Impe, the winner of 1976, had broken his collarbone and was still recovering.\nThe main contenders were debutant Hinault, who had won the 1978 Vuelta a España, and Joop Zoetemelk, who had already finished in second place for three times. Pre-race analysis judged Hinault better in the time trials, and Zoetemelk better in the mountains. Bernard Thévenet, the winner of the 1977 Tour de France, was out of form, and not considered a favourite.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1978 Tour de France started on 29 June, and had two rest days, in Biarritz and Alpe d'Huez. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 11.\nThe twenty-first stage from Épernay to Senlis was split in three parts: 78.5 km from Épernay to Soissons, directly followed by 59 km from Soissons to Compiègne, directly followed by 70.5 km from Compiègne to Senlis; the sprints in Soissons and Compiègne counted as flying stages, which were won by Freddy Maertens and Wilfried Wesemael. Although they technically had the same status as all other stages, these flying stages are not shown in most overviews.\nRace overview.\nDuring the prologue, held in the Netherlands, the weather was bad. The four top places were taken by Dutch cyclists, with Jan Raas the winner. The team directors then had a meeting, and all but the manager of Raas' team voted to request the Tour directors to not count the results from the prologue for the overall classification. The directors agreed, so the prologue results did not count. Jan Raas was still given the stage win, but he was not recognized as race leader, so he was not allowed to wear the yellow jersey during the first stage. The winner of the previous year, Bernard Thévenet, was allowed to wear the yellow jersey, but he refused. In that first stage, Raas and his team were full of anger. Raas escaped close to the finish, and beat everybody by a second, thus becoming the race's leader after all.\nRaas lost the lead in the third stage. The fourth stage was run as a time trial. The TI–Raleigh team was specialized in this, and they won the stage. Klaus-Peter Thaler of the TI–Raleigh team became the new leader, thanks to the bonification seconds. Hinault beat Zoetemelk in the time trial in stage eight. Joseph Bruyère, former second man of Eddy Merckx, finished in second place and became the new race leader.\nThe eleventh stage included the toughest mountains in the Pyrenées. On the last mountain, the Pla d'Adet, Pollentier and Zoetemelk attacked, and Martinez and Hinault soon followed. Martinez rode away to win the stage, and Hinault won some seconds on Zoetemelk. Bruyère stayed the leader, with Hinault in second place and Zoetemelk in third place. During that stage, Thevenet retired. The next day, the twelfth stage was scheduled, split into two sections. This meant that after the transfer from the previous stage, the riders were not in bed before 12:00 am, and had to wake up at 5:00 am. In the early stage to Valence-d'Agen, the riders held a strike against the early start. They rode at a slow pace of , arrived at the finish well behind schedule, and crossed the finish line walking. The Tour officials canceled the stage. The fourteenth stage was an individual mountain time trial. Zoetemelk won the stage, beating Bruyère by 55 seconds and Hinault by 100 seconds. Hinault had lost some time because his lightweight bike, that he intended to use for the steepest part, broke when he hit a spectator while changing bikes.\nIn the sixteenth stage, that ended on top of Alpe d'Huez, Pollentier attacked. At the foot of the Alpe d'Huez, Pollentier had a margin of two minutes. He was chased by Hinault, Zoetemelk and Kuiper, who at 4 km before the finish had closed the gap to 50 seconds. Hinault then attacked, and Kuiper could follow but Zoetemelk had to let them go. Pollentier stayed away, won the stage and became the new leader of the general classification. As stage winner and general classification leader, Pollentier had to go to the doping control. Pollentier first went to his hotel, and was only found two hours later. Another cyclist at the doping control, Antoine Guttierrez, was found with a fake urine sample, trying to use it to fake the doping control. This device did not work, and the race doctor discovered the fraud. He then checked the other cyclists, and Pollentier was using the same fraud. Pollentier was removed from the race, and Zoetemelk became the new leader. Pollentier later explained that he tried to evade the controls because he had taken amphetamines for breathing, and he did not know if it would give back a positive test.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Kuiper, third in the general classification, crashed, broke a clavicle, and had to leave the race. Hinault was only 14 seconds behind Zoetemelk at the start of the time trial in stage 20. Hinault won that time trial by more than four minutes over Zoetemelk, and became the race leader.\nDoping.\nIn total, 110 doping tests were done. Three cyclists were penalised for doping offences, all tested after the sixteenth stage; Antoine Guttierrez, for attempt of fraud; Michel Pollentier, for attempt of fraud; and José Nazabal. Nazabal had already anticipated the positive result, and had left the race before the eighteenth stage.\nGuttierrez and Pollentier were removed from the race and banned for two months; Nazabal was set back to the last place of the stage, received ten minutes penalty time in the general classification, a fine of 1000 Swiss Francs and one month provisional suspension.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1978 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. Some rules were changed after the 1977 Tour de France, mainly concerning the time bonuses. In previous years, intermediate sprints were not associated with time bonuses, but in 1978, the winner of such a sprint got 20 seconds bonification time, if he was part of an escape (defined as a group with less than 20% of the total cyclists, with a margin of 20 seconds of more on the next group).\nThe penalty system was also changed. In previous years, cyclists who broke the rules on minor points (being pushed, taking drinks on places where it was not allowed) were penalised with points in the points classification. From 1978 on, time penalties were also given for the general classification.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but restricted to riders who were born after 1 July 1978, and were in their first or second year as professional cyclist. There were 34 riders that qualified for the classification on the start list. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1978, this classification had no associated jersey.\nThe team classification in 1977 was calculated with the times of the three best cyclists per team, but was in 1978 changed to the best five cyclists. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. The Kas team finished with only two cyclists, so was not eligible for the team classifications. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point on stage 11 in the valley village of Sainte-Marie de Campan climb. This prize was won by Christian Seznec.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Paul Wellens won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.\nSuper Prestige Pernod ranking.\nThe top twelve places of the general classification awarded points that contributed towards the Super Prestige Pernod ranking, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. The 110 points accrued by Bernard Hinault moved him to the top, replacing Francesco Moser, who did not ride the Tour."

        "text": "The 1977 Tour de France was the 64th edition of the Tour de France, taking place between 30 June and 24 July. The total race distance was 22 stages over .\nLucien Van Impe, the winner of the previous year, wanted to repeat his victory and going into stage 16 Van Impe along with Eddy Merckx and Joop Zoetemelk were all within about 1:00 of Bernard Thévenet who had just taken the maillot jaune from Dietrich Thurau. Merckx fell off the back near the end of the tour, Zoetemelk was penalized ten minutes and Van Impe had his bike damaged when he was hit by a motorist on Alpe d'Huez where Kuiper won the stage but was unable to break Thévenet, who won the Tour with the smallest margin since the 1968 Tour de France.\nTeams.\nTo ride the Tour, teams had to pay money. The other Grand Tours, the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España, paid the teams money to start. For financial reasons, some teams chose to avoid the Tour, and only 100 cyclists started the race, divided in ten teams of ten cyclists each. One of the notable absentees was Michel Pollentier.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nBernard Thévenet, the winner of 1975, was considered the main favourite, because the course of the race was considered suited to his talents. In March 1977, Thévenet had been penalised for a positive doping test in Paris–Nice.\nThe winner of the 1976 edition, Lucien Van Impe, was specialized in climbing, so his chances in the 1977 edition with less mountains were slimmer. Two other contenders were teammates Raymond Delisle and Joop Zoetemelk, fourth and second in the 1976 edition. Hennie Kuiper, the reigning world champion, was also a favourite.\nFive-time winner Eddy Merckx was also competing, and was still considered an outsider for the victory, but he was no longer as dominant as before.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1977 Tour de France started on 30 June, and had two rest days, in Bordeaux and Freiburg. The 1976 Tour had been focused around the mountains, with five hilltop finishes. In 1977, the climbing was de-emphasized, with only two hilltop finishes, and more emphasis on the time trials. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 2.\nThe first stage from Fleurance to Auch was split in two parts: 140 km from Fleurance to Lectoure, directly followed by 97 km from Lectoure to Auch. It was the first time a \"flying stage\" was used. The stage was split in two parts, but there was no stop in between. After the riders reached the finish line of the first part, they immediately continued for the next part; if a group was ahead of the rest, they kept this advantage. The first riders to reach the finish of the flying stage were given prizes and points for the points classification as if it was a normal stage; the general classification was not changed.\nRace overview.\nThe prologue was won by Dietrich Thurau, who made his debut in the Tour. Thurau wanted to be the leader when the Tour would enter his native Germany in stage 13. In the second stage, big mountains were scheduled, unusually early in the race, and Thurau saw this as the biggest threat to this goal. When Van Impe, Thévenet and Kuiper were away leaving Thurau behind, Thurau worked together with Merckx, and they were able to reach the leaders, and Thurau was able to win the sprint. The second part of the fifth stage was a time trial. Eddy Merckx, at that moment only 8 seconds behind Thurau, was expected to win enough time on Thurau to become the new leader, but surprisingly Thurau won the time trial, and extended his lead.\nThurau was able to keep control of the race for the next stages, and when the Tour entered Germany, he was still leading the race, 51 seconds ahead of Merckx.\nPrior to the start of the second part of stage 15, an individual climbing time trial, Thurau was 0:51 ahead of Merckx with Thévenet in third place at 1:22, Kuiper in fourth at 1:40, in fifth was Alain Meslet, Van Impe was in sixth at 2:31 and Zoetemelk clinging to the Top 10 at 3:40. This quick, but difficult hill climb up the Avoriaz would separate the handful of riders with a legitimate chance winning the general classification from the rest of the field as the Tour entered its third, final, and by far most grueling week.\nThe stage was won by Zoetemelk, with Van Impe being placed second as Thévenet claimed third twenty seconds behind Van Impe. Merckx finished nearly two minutes behind Zoetemelk in tenth place and while Thurau finished outside the Top 10, he, perhaps surprisingly, did not fall out of contention as he now was in second place in the general classification, 0:11 behind the new leader Bernard Thévenet.\nWith a difficult hilly stage, and then two major mountain stages over the next three days, which would decide the 1977 Tour de France, Merckx was now in third place at 0:25 back, Van Impe was fourth at 0:33, Kuiper was fifth at 0:49 and Zoetemelk moved from 10th place nearly four minutes behind the leader, up to 6th place just over one minute behind Thévenet. With four of the most dominant general classification riders and the two outsiders of Kuiper and Thurau within about a minute, it was clear the Tour was not decided yet and the upcoming mountains were going to be exciting, vicious and attack after attack after attack would be coming.\nIn stage 16, these attacks blew apart the entire Peloton as the elite contenders separated themselves from everybody else in the field. Initially Didi Thurau was dropped with the domestiques, breakaway hopefuls and sprinters but he was able to fight his way back to the point where he could see the group of elite riders at the base of the final climb. From there he would rejoin the group on the descent, maneuver his way to the front and actually beat everybody in the sprint to gut out an impressive stage win all while keeping himself in contention for the overall lead. Anyone not in this front group of elite riders pretty much lost their chance at winning the Tour, with the exception of Eddy Merckx, as he was dropped, but was still within about three minutes of Thévenet in seventh place overall and while for most any other rider a gap of more than three minutes this late in the race would be all but impossible to overcome with six riders ahead of him, for Merckx nothing was impossible and nobody would have been surprised if he somehow found a way to win this Tour. The new sixth place rider Francisco Galdós was able to stay with the other main contenders and moved ahead of Merckx.\nThe overall situation between Thévenet, Thurau, Van Impe, Kuiper and Zoetemelk remained the same headed into stage 17, which included a grueling finish atop Alpe d'Huez. Well into stage 17 Lucien Van Impe saw an opportunity to attack and took it separating himself from the general classification contenders building more than a minute gap to the point that he was virtually leading the general classification by the time he reached the bottom of the climb on Alpe d'Huez. This put Thévenet in the position where he now had to give chase or lose the lead.\nRaymond Martin, Merckx, Thurau, Raymond Delisle, Michel Laurent, Sebastian Pozo and Joaquim Agostinho were among the elite group of riders when the counterattack against Van Impe came. While these riders finished considerably ahead of the rest of the field it was only Kuiper, Galdos and Zoetemelk who were able to go with Thévenet as he rode away from everyone else in pursuit of Van Impe. These riders made Thévenet defend his first position in the general classification, and do all of the work while riding in his slipstream, at no time coming to the front to take a pull of the heavy climbing work.\nThévenet was determined to win his second Tour de France, just as Van Impe showed his determination to repeat as champion when he launched his early attack, although for Van Impe it was out of the ordinary, being as ordinarily he would be racing for the mountains classification points. Fortunately for Thévenet his hard work was paying off as the gap between Van Impe and the first chase group began to close, but as he was reeling in one opponent he was also bringing two other opponents along with him and not just bringing them along but putting them in position to attack his position in the general classification as he was the one doing all the work. Naturally Kuiper and Zoetemelk were both determined to earn their first ever Tour victory so they didn't think twice about forcing Thévenet to lead the way in chasing down Lucien Van Impe.\nBefore long the gap had become small enough that the television and official cars riding behind Van Impe had to move out of the way as it was beginning to look as though this hard charging chase group would catch the leader before the finish line. One of these cars ended up hitting Van Impe severely damaging his bike in the process and while he tried to continue riding it just wasn't possible. As a result, he was stuck waiting and watching for the team car to appear around the corner to repair his wheel or get him a new bike but unfortunately two of the riders closest to him in the standings appeared before his team car did and raced right on by. By the end of the stage Zoetemelk and Francisco Galdós had been dropped when Hennie Kuiper launched an attack as Thévenet was digging deeper and pushing harder than he ever had in his whole life, not so much to take advantage of Van Impe's misfortune, although this certainly worked to his benefit, but to chase down Hennie Kuiper who was up the road by himself headed for the finish line so close to him in the standings that he could take over the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\nThévenet was enraged with Kuiper for making him to do all the work chasing down Van Impe and then attacking in an attempt to take the first place in the general classification and had to push himself to his absolute breaking point in order to cross the finish line second place to Kuiper 0:41 behind.\nDespite being hit by a motorist, Van Impe ended up 2:06 behind Kuiper while still finishing ahead of everybody else in the race. Galdos crossed at 2:59, Zoetemelk crossed more than four minutes later as the second level of the top tier riders including Laurent, Pozo, Martin and Pedro Torres started filtering across the line more than eight minutes behind Kuiper.\nBy the end of the day the devastation wrought on the peloton was complete as 30 riders were thrown out of the race for finishing outside the time limit set by Thévenet, Zoetemelk, Kuiper, Galdos and especially Van Impe for forcing the pace. At this point these five riders were the only ones with a realistic chance at victory as Thévenet kept his lead by a minuscule 0:08 over Hennie Kuiper while Lucien Van Impe was still in contention in third place 1:59 behind as Galdos and Zoetemelk were about four and five minutes behind respectively.\nWhile all the main contenders passed the doping controls following stage 17 it was later learned that Zoetemelk had tested positive following his time trial victory in the second part of stage 15. Doping was appearing to be a bit more commonplace than officials or fans realised, which contributed to a more relaxed rider culture on the subject. After he retired Thévenet would admit that he doped when he won the 1975 Tour de France as well as in other editions just as numerous other riders had.\nIn stage 18, Joaquim Agostinho initially won the day after launching a breakaway that finished about eight minutes ahead of everyone else in the field except for Antonio Menéndez, who finished 3:17 behind him, and Eddy Merckx who finished 3:20 back. Agostinho and Menendez both failed doping controls while Merckx was not tested (the testing protocol tested the stage winner, runner up, race leader and two other randomly selected cyclists). Agostinho's penalty would cost him in the end as he would finish outside the top 10 because of it. There were no major changes at the top of the general classification as all attacks and counterattacks were answered by the group and they all finished with the same time.\nTypically after the final mountain stage there is one last chance to gain time in the overall classification with an individual time trial, but in this year's edition there were two ITT's to decide the final winner of the general classification. One typical incredibly challenging 50 km course around Dijon in stage 20 and one similar to an initial prologue during the split stage 22A which was around the Champs-Élysées prior to the circuit finish in 22B.\nDuring the stage 20 time trial only seven riders of the decimated main field were able to finish within three minutes of eventual stage winner Bernard Thévenet. Of these seven only fourth-place finisher Gerrie Knetemann and fifth place Joseph Bruyere were not in the top 10 of the general classification. Didi Thurau came in second 0:23 behind and while Hennie Kuiper put in an incredibly strong ride he was not able to outperform Thévenet as he was 0:28 slower in third place, but still firmly in command of second place in the general classification, now 0:36 back. While Agostinho, Merckx and Van Impe each put in a strong time trial by this point in the race Van Impe was in third at 3:22 back so realistically, with only one short time trial and one and a half flat stages remaining, only Kuiper had even the slightest chance of overtaking Thévenet and this didn't seem likely as Thévenet had just defeated Kuiper.\nStage 21 was a flat stage where three riders managed to either survive a breakaway, or launch a late break to stay away from the peloton and finish 0:19 ahead of the main field. Being as Jacques Esclassan had a commanding lead in the points classification over Giacinto Santambrogio, Didi Thurau and sixth place sprinter Barry Hoban the escape made by Joop Zoetemelk, Michel Laurent and stage winner Gerrie Knetemann did nothing to change any of the classifications although it was another strong performance by Knetemann who would win ten Tour stages in his career and also be instrumental in helping Zoetemelk win the 1980 Tour de France along with ten time stage winner Jan Raas.\nStage 22A was the final opportunity to change the overall classification although in a time trial this short making up gaps of even over 0:20 was all but impossible, let alone the 0:37 Kuiper would need to overtake Thévenet. In the end Thévenet would add twelve seconds to his lead officially securing his overall victory in the 1977 Tour de France. Impressively in Stage 22B, Alain Meslet would survive a breakaway and finish nearly a minute ahead of the main field to win on the Champs-Élysées.\nThe podium ended up with Bernard Thévenet winning his 2nd Tour de France, followed by Hennie Kuiper in 2nd and Lucien Van Impe, who also won another mountains classification.\nDoping.\nEvery day, five cyclists were tested for doping: the leader in the general classification, the winner of the stage, the runner-up of the stage, and two randomly selected cyclists, for a total of 110 tests. Six cyclists tested positive for Pemoline: Joop Zoetemelk (15th stage), Sebastien Pozo (16th stage), Antonio Menéndez (17th and 18th stage), Joaquim Agostinho (18th stage), Fernando Mendes (18th stage) and Luis Ocaña (18th stage). Pozo was unable to provide urine within two hours for the doping control after the prologue, which is treated as a positive result. All were fined with 1000 Swiss Francs, received one month of provisional suspension, were set back to the last place in the stage and penalised with 10 minutes in the general classification.\nDirectly after the Tour, there were rumours about Thévenet and Kuiper having used doping. The Tour officials came together, and made a statement that Thévenet was officially the winner of the Tour.\nSome months later, when Thévenet was in hospital, he admitted having used cortisone. His popularity plunged after that, and Thévenet was never again able to compete for the general classification. Though he was able to stay near the second tier general classification riders approaching the end of his career as he finished in the top 20 of both the 1980 Tour de France and Vuelta.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1977 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only neo-professionals were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1977, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Gerrie Knetemann won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 2. This prize was won by Lucien Van Impe.\nAftermath.\nDue to the relentless pace set by the top tier riders only 53 riders were able to finish the 1977 Tour de France. Never since have so few riders finished a Tour de France and the previous time fewer riders finished was the 1950 Tour de France when 51 riders finished. In years before and after this Tour riders like Merckx, Hinault, Zoetemelk, Van Impe, Thévenet, Luis Ocaña and Laurent Fignon set such a high pace during mountain stages that as many as half the riders in the main field would have been expelled from the race, but exemptions were made and the time limit was altered to allow them to continue the Tour. No such exemptions were given in the 1977 edition.\nDue to doping infractions by another rider Meslet would go from 11th to 10th place overall, Raymond Delisle finished 9th, Zoetemelk ended up in 8th overall because of the ten minute penalty, which impressively enough would be the worst he would ever finish until his 13th participation in 1983.\nMichel Laurent moved up into 7th place overall as Merckx would finish his final Grand Tour a career worst 6th, with it also being one of the few Grand Tours he entered that he did not win.\nThe immediate aftermath of this Tour was that it was the end of the Merckx era and the last time Thévenet and Van Impe would be in legitimate contention of winning the Tour de France while the 1978 Tour de France would be the beginning of three consecutive years where Joop Zoetemelk and Bernard Hinault would basically race against one another while everybody else fought for third place.\nLike Meslet this would be the finest Tour Dietrich Thurau would ever race finishing in 5th place overall. While Klaus-Peter Thaler would wear the yellow jersey in 1978 the next German to wear the yellow jersey and be in contention of winning the Tour de France would not come for nearly two decades with Jan Ullrich.\nSpaniard Francisco Galdós earned fourth place overall as he found a way to stay with the elite riders every single time it mattered. Due to a tough break Lucien Van Impe finished third and because he caught some breaks and wanted it more than anyone Hennie Kuiper made it a two-way race between himself and Thévenet by the end of the Tour.\nHennie Kuiper would never win the Tour and the 1977 Tour was the closest he ever came, although he did finish second one additional time in the 1980 Tour. After retiring in 1988 he would go on to complete many more Tours from a team car and would work in public relations. In the early 1990s he was worked for Team Motorola and would end up giving a young Lance Armstrong very excited instructions in his formative professional years. After leaving Motorola in 1996 he would be hired by Team Rabobank."

        "text": "The 1976 Tour de France was the 63rd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took between 24 June and 18 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of .\nIt was won by mountain specialist Lucien Van Impe in a battle with the previous winner Bernard Thévenet and Joop Zoetemelk. Zoetemelk won three high mountain stages including Alpe d'Huez and Puy-de-Dôme but this Tour became known for when the young directeur sportif of Van Impe, Cyrille Guimard, threatened to run Van Impe off the road with the Team Car if he didn't attack. Van Impe then attacked and won the Tour.\nThe revelation of the Tour however was Freddy Maertens, who in his first Tour won eight stages and the points classification, and led the general classification for ten days.\nFive-time winner Eddy Merckx did not join in the 1976 Tour de France because he was injured. 1975 winner Bernard Thévenet left the race in the 19th stage, but at that point it was already clear that Van Impe would win the race.\nThe mountains classification was won by Giancarlo Bellini with 170 points, only one point ahead of Lucien Van Impe. The young rider classification was won by Enrique Martínez Heredia. Heredia had already won the Tour de l'Avenir in 1974, but never broke through after this win.\nTeams.\nThe 1976 Tour started with 13 teams, each sent 10 cyclists, a total of 130.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nEddy Merckx, who already had won the Tour de France five times, had troubles to find his form in 1976, and suffered from saddle sores. He decided not to enter the 1976 Tour de France.\nThe main favourite for the victory was now Joop Zoetemelk, who had never finished worse than fifth place in the Tour de France.\nThe winner of the previous Tour, Bernard Thévenet, had a good spring season, winning the Dauphiné Libéré. The other former winner that was still racing, Luis Ocaña, had come second in the 1976 Vuelta a España, and was hoping to win again. Also reigning world champion Hennie Kuiper was considered a pre-race favourite.\nNot considered a favorite by any means was the 40 year old 'eternal second' Raymond Poulidor, who was riding in his final Tour. While he finished a good distance behind Van Impe and Zoetemelk he surprised the rest of the field by finishing on the podium in 3rd place.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1976 Tour de France started on 24 June, and had two rest days, the first in Divonne-les-Bains the second at Le Barcarès. The 1976 Tour de France was divided into 22 stages and one prologue. Of the 22 stages, three were split stages: stages 5 and 22 were split into two half stages, and stage 18 was split into three smaller stages. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 15.\nStage 18a was originally scheduled to be 47 km longer, but after the 17th stage, the Tour direction saw that cyclists were exhausted, and shortened the stage.\nRace overview.\nThe First Week.\nThe prologue was won by Freddy Maertens by 0:17 over the 2nd place rider. Between 1967 and 2012 most Tour's had a prologue, which is a short individual time trial less than 10 km, and this victory by Maertens was the largest margin of victory in Tour history. By comparison Merckx's largest prologue victory was only 0:11, yet is still the 3rd largest of all time. The directeur sportif for the Flandria team was Guillaume \"Lomme\" Driessens, a man who knew what it took to win the Tour de France having directed Merckx; and he was hesitant about allowing his young potential star starting a Tour this early in his career, but he was overridden by the team owner Pol Claeys and Maertens was added to the start list. He followed his prologue victory with another victory in stage 1, and during stage 2 he once again attempted to work his way to the front of the pack to fight for the win where he, along with everybody else, was beaten to the finish line by Giovanni Battaglin who took the victory by a full ten seconds. Stage 3 was another ITT, a 37 km ride around a beach resort along the English Channel known as Le Touquet Paris Plage. Again it was Maertens stealing all of the headlines handily beating the three favorites, as well as the time trial specialists by a considerable margin of over two minutes. In fact, the 2nd place rider at +1:37 behind was neither a favorite nor a specialist but rather his best friend within the peloton, and another young Belgian in Michel Pollentier, who shared the exact same birthday as Maertens, but was one year older. Another up and coming rider who performed well during the time trial was the Dutchman and defending World Champion Hennie Kuiper who finished 2:57 behind Maertens, but still fared better than Thévenet, Van Impe and Zoetemelk.\nStage 4 was won by Kuiper, who beat Eric Loder in a sprint as the two of them finished nine seconds ahead of Piero Gavazzi, Guy Sibille and Gerard Vianen. Stage 5A was a short team time trial won by the TI–Raleigh squad who was beginning to evolve into one of the strongest time-trialling teams the Tour would ever know as there was no major changes to the overall situation. Stage 5B was yet another flat stage where the winner was able to gain about a ten-second advantage over the pursuing riders who had gotten ahead of the peloton. Guy Sibille had found a way to get up front again, but again he came up short, this time to Miguel-Maria Lasa who won the day. During stage 6 from Bastogne to Nancy, Italian rider Aldo Parecchini escaped and won on a solo breakaway where he finished four and a half minutes ahead of the main field. Stage 7 was an intermediate hilly stage through the Vosges including the Grand Ballon that went from Bastogne to Mulhouse and ended with a bunch sprint velodrome finish where Piero Gavazzi and Jacques Esclassan were beat to the line by Maertens who had taken his fourth stage win of the first week.\nReturn to Alpe d'Huez.\nStage 8 was another intermediate hilly stage through the Jura Mountains and was a repeat of the podium places from the previous day where yet again it was Gavazzi, Esclassan and Maertens who took the top places, except this time Esclassan got the win. Going into the first rest day the overall situation had Maertens in the maillot jaune by 2:04 over Pollentier, 3:16 over Kuiper, 3:23 over Jean-Pierre Danguillaume and 3:31 over Raymond Poulidor.\nThe contenders for the overall victory were thought to be Bernard Thévenet, Joop Zoetemelk and Lucien Van Impe, but all of them were about 4:00 off the lead. Indeed, they were waiting for the mountains to start their battle as the 1976 Tour was designed to be especially grueling with eight high mountain stages including three consecutive high mountain stages in the Alps, followed by a rest day and then four consecutive high mountain stages in the Pyrenees making for seven straight mountain stages which would absolutely devastate the peloton leaving very few riders, and among them only the riders who excelled in climbing, in contention for the win by the time the final time trial came around in stage 17, followed by one last high mountain stage atop Puy-de-Dôme in stage 20. The first of these mountain stages finished atop a mountain resort known as Alpe d'Huez. None of the riders in the Tour had ever ridden this stage during the Tour as it had not been included since the 1952 Tour de France when the owner of a hotel in town brought a box of money to Tour organizers and asked them to bring the Grande Boucle to his mountain. History repeated itself to get the Tour to return to the Alpine resort but history would not repeat itself by waiting another quarter century to return to it, rather the legend of Alpe d'Huez was born.\nBy this point in the Tour many in the press were stunned by the commanding performance of Maertens, to the point that there was speculation among them that he could win the Tour. Even five time Tour champion Jacques Anquetil now thought he could do exactly what his countryman Eddy Merckx had done and win the title in his Tour debut. It was because of stages like this that his directeur sportif Lomme Driessens felt nervous about including the young rider in the Tour because a disastrous stage in the high mountains can have a devastating effect on the psyche of a young rider. Maertens felt he was ready for this however, as he and his friend Michel Pollentier had ridden Alpe d'Huez twenty times during the off-season to be sure he had mastered every one of the twenty-one hairpin turns. The directeur sportif for Van Impe was the young retired rider Cyrille Guimard, and Guimard together with his team captain Robert Mintkiewicz had suggested to Van Impe that he attacked right at the base of Alpe d'Huez and this is exactly what he intended to do. In fact, early in the stage Van Impe rode up alongside Maertens, smiled wryly, and told him he was going to attack at the foot of the Alpe. Maertens replied with a straight face saying nothing more than \"I'm ready\", because he knew that he was.\nThe boredom within the peloton of the early morning riding through the valley was broken up when Gerben Karstens scooped up a traffic cone off the side of the road and put it on his head like a hat as he continued riding along. Loud cheers of laughter and approval rang out across the peloton, but race officials were not nearly as amused as before long he was spotted and fined 175 francs for \"making ridiculous jokes\", prompting the Dutchman to remove his new hat and toss it to some fans standing alongside the road. Before long the ridiculous jokes gave way to the serious attacks as a group of about forty riders made it over the first climb in good order, including the three favorites as well as the young riders of Kuiper, Pollentier and Maertens. Despite the advice from his directeur and team captain, Van Impe joined an early attack made by Italian riders Fausto Bertoglio and Marcello Bergamo to both test the waters, and see if he couldn't get away from the rest of the elite riders. Before long the threesome was reeled back by the group led by Zoetemelk and Thevenet. By the time the race reached the foot of Alpe d'Huez French rider Raymond Delisle launched the first attack and from there riders began being dropped left and right, including Kuiper, Maertens and Pollentier. Zoetemelk and Van Impe then relentlessly attack one another over and over again until the two of them were the only two riders remaining. Neither Thevenet nor Poulidor could match the two riders from the Low Countries as they were both dropped within a group of six riders. Spaniard Francisco Galdós was the final rider to stay in contact but in the end Van Impe and Zoetemelk were alone heading for the finish line where Zoetemelk finally pulled away to take the stage win. At the end of the day, Van Impe put on the yellow jersey for the first time in his career, Zoetemelk rose all the way to 2nd place less than ten seconds behind Van Impe and while Maertens did lose considerable time, he still managed to hold on to 3rd place at 0:54 back.\nThe following day in stage 10 it was another three grueling climbs including a mountaintop finish at Montgenèvre. Yet again the attacks came often and were entirely relentless as the peloton was devastated for the 2nd day in a row. Any and all ideas Maertens had of winning the Tour were dispatched as he just could not stay with the elite climbers for a second day in a row. His teammate Pollentier however, rode strongly and was within the final group of elite riders on the final climb, but he and Bergamo began to crack as Delisle, Poulidor, Kuiper, Galdos, Zoetemelk, Van Impe and Thevenet rode on. In the end it was Van Impe, Zoetemelk and Thevenet riding together as the finish line approached where Zoetemelk was able to pull away from both of them to claim his 2nd stage win in a row. In the overall situation Van Impe and Zoetemelk had separated themselves from the rest of the field, but were only separated from one another by 0:07. In 3rd place was Poulidor at +1:36, in 4th was defending champ Thevenet at +1:48, in 5th was Galdos at +2:04 with Bertoglio just one second behind him as Pollentier, Kuiper, Delisle and José Martíns rounded out the top 10 with each rider more than +4:00. Stage 11 was stunning because of the dominating solo attack made by José-Luis Viejo, who finished 22:50 ahead of 2nd place Gerben Karstens and 23:07 ahead of the main field lead in by 3rd place Freddy Maertens. Viejo was not a threat to the overall leaders so going into the 2nd rest day there were no major changes atop the general classification, but his stage victory was remarkable as it was the biggest winning margin in post-World War II history. José Viejo won the stage, 22 minutes and 50 seconds ahead of the next cyclist.\nThe Pyrenees.\nIn stage 12 two days later, there was another solo attack that did have ramifications for the general classification. Raymond Delisle went on the offensive and while Delisle was not considered a threat for overall victory, he was just over four minutes behind the overall lead so Van Impe wondered if he should give chase. Guimard instructed him to stand fast and keep Zoetemelk marked as he felt Zoetemelk was the only rider who posed a threat to his chances at victory. By the end of the day however, Delisle had surprised the entire field by staying away, and building a gap of 4:59 over Antonio Menéndez by the time he crossed the finish line atop the Pyrenees 2000 resort. By the time Zoetemelk crossed the line with the same time as Viejo he was 6:57 behind the stage winner as Van Impe and the other favorites crossed one second later meaning for the 3rd stage in a row Zoetemelk had taken one second from Van Impe, but now both of them trailed the new race leader Raymond Delisle by nearly 3:00. In stage 13 the contenders all stayed together and a group of seven riders who survived all of the climbs fought it out for the stage win. Régis Ovion initially won the stage, ahead of Willy Teirlinck and Wladimiro Panizza but Ovion failed a drug test so Tierlinck and Panizza were promoted to 1st and 2nd place while 3rd place was left vacated with Ovion left off the back of the standings to fight again another day.\nStage 14 included the Col de Mente, the Portillon, Peyresourde, a summit finish at St.-Lary-Soulon and would change the Tour dramatically as by the end of the day nearly no one would be within ten minutes of the Yellow Jersey. It started off no different from any other day in the mountains with the breakaway hopefuls and KOM hunters attacking the early climbs hoping to stay away or going for points but before long there was a group of five formidable riders in an escape that caught the attention of Guimard for one reason or another, possibly because it included Luis Ocaña. Ocaña was about ten minutes behind Van Impe, a considerable distance, but Ocaña was a very strong rider and due to his performance earlier in the season was seen as once again being a potential contender for the Tour. This in conjunction with the facts that at the time it was still burned in everyone's mind what Ocana had done to essentially win the 1971 Tour, and the last time Ocaña had ridden a stage that included the Col de Menté, during the 1973 Tour de France, he dropped every rider in the field and won the stage by several minutes over everyone other than Zoetemelk. Whatever Guimard's reasons, he wanted Van Impe to join in this attack which also included other very strong climbers in the Giro contender Walter Riccomi and Spanish climbing specialist Pedro Torres, but this obviously was not part of the pre-planned strategy and on the surface seemed unnecessarily risky, as Van Impe was reluctant to do so when Guimard gave him the order. Guimard followed his gut and became animated, threatening to hit him with the team car if he didn't attack and after the discussion was over Van Impe was on his way to bridging the gap as Zoetemelk, Delisle, Poulidor and the defending champ watched without reacting, either feeling unable to survive a long range attack, or in the case of Zoetemelk not feeling the breakaway would survive.\nWhen Van Impe joined the breakaway they continued working together and their gap over the fast depleting peloton gradually increased. Ocana had no problem working together with Van Impe as Ocana and Zoetemelk were vicious rivals for a number of reasons and the two of them had also been involved in crashes in which both riders were seriously injured and nearly killed, leaving the race in a helicopter or an ambulance during a 1971 Tour crash, and a 1974 Midi-Libre crash. Being the 1970s riders and team leaders on the road did not have access to the modern real-time information regarding time gaps and by the time Zoetemelk learned that the breakaway Van Impe was about to join was working, continuing to gain time, and looked as though it might get away if he didn't react immediately, it was too late. The Peugeot team of Delisle did not defend the yellow jersey as Zoetemelk had anticipated and this also contributed to his hesitation. Once he realized Delisle was not going to pursue Van Impe he knew his pursuit would be a solo attack as nobody else, including Delisle, Poulidor, nor Thevenet, could go with him. Zoetemelk rode on his own in pursuit, furiously giving chase, kilometre after kilometre and was able to come within about a minute of catching Van Impe, but as Van Impe arrived within the breakaway group made up of incredibly strong climbers, they all began working together taking turns doing the heavy work at the front causing the gap back to Zoetemelk to increase. Zoetemelk was one of the best riders of his generation but there was simply no way he could chase down so many world class riders all working together. By the time he reached the final climb it was a certainty he would not be able to catch Van Impe, who later in the stage had attacked the breakaway he was in and was riding on solo towards both the stage victory, and since Delisle had cracked, the Yellow Jersey. Zoetemelk was going faster than any other rider up the final climb as he managed to catch and drop all of the other breakaway riders including Torres, Ocana and Riccomi, but Van Impe's attack had paid off, and by the time Zoetemelk hit the finish line he was more than three minutes behind the Belgian. Delisle had fallen to 3rd at 9:27, Riccomi had jumped to 4th at 10:22 as the rest of the new top 10 including Poulidor, Galdos, Bertoglio, Freddy Maertens, José Pesarrodona and Luis Ocaña were beyond eleven minutes.\nStage 15 was the final day in the Pyrenees and included three climbs often included in the Tour in the Col d'Aspin, the Col du Tourmalet and the Col d'Aubisque. Zoetemelk was the only rider with a realistic chance of overtaking Van Impe but the two of them would finish together 5:44 behind the winner Panizza and 2:16 behind the surviving breakaway riders including Enrico Paolini, Arnaldo Caverzasi, Donato Giuliani, Antonio Menéndez, Georges Talbourdet, Carlos Melero, José Martíns and Michel Pollentier who climbed back up to 7th place overall by surviving within this breakaway.\nThe Final Week.\nStage 16 was a return to the flatlands where Pollentier continued his strong riding by beating 2nd place Maertens, 3rd place Karstens and the rest of the peloton to the line by 0:16. Stage 17 was the final long individual time trial and would decide whether or not Van Impe would put a stranglehold on his 1st-place position, or if Zoetemelk would cut into his lead and set up a final battle on the upcoming Puy-de-Dôme. The stage was won by time trial specialist Ferdi Bracke by 0:08 over Norwegian time trial specialist Knut Knudsen. In the earlier time trial Maertens had beaten Bracke by more than two minutes, and while this time he finished in 3rd place 0:11 back, Maertens had shown he had the ability to survive the high mountains and still perform well in the final week of the Tour. The biggest battle of the day however, was won by Van Impe who finished in 4th place 0:51 behind Bracke, but far more importantly more than a minute ahead of Zoetemelk, meaning he now led the Dutchman by 4:33. This was going to be a tall order for Zoetemelk on Puy-de-Dôme, but the final mountain stage in stage 20 was going to be the last chance for significant changes in the general classification. Stage 18 was actually three different stages, split into sections A, B, and C as the Tour moved from the historical city of Auch in the Pyrenean foothills all the way to the Atlantic coast and the equally historical city of Bordeaux. 18A was won by Freddy Maertens who put on a show in this stage as he outsprinted Gerben Karstens for the win, then in 18B he outsprinted the Frenchman Jacques Esclassan to take the win, but in stage 18C he was finally beaten and finished 2nd in the sprint, to Gerben Karstens. Guy Sibille had been involved in these closely contested stages as well, and was given the Combativity Award for all three stages for his efforts. Stage 19 would not have a bunch sprint finish but was decided by a successful group of escapees who managed to beat the peloton to the line by just over seven minutes or so as Hubert Mathis claimed the stage win by 0:07 over the other eight breakaway riders.\nStage 20 was the final chance for Zoetemelk to attack Van Impe, and attack Van Impe he did. Throughout the Tour the excessive pace set by Zoetemelk and Van Impe as they attacked one another would have caused as many as half the riders to be thrown out of the Tour for finishing outside the cut-off time limit, had the rules not been changed by officials to allow most of them to remain in the race, and this stage would be more of the same. Zoetemelk put the pressure on Van Impe and very much like during the first major mountain stage on Alp d'Huez it was Zoetemelk and Van Impe leaving everyone else behind as Francisco Galdós was once again the last rider to lose contact with them. For the third time in the Tour Zoetemelk was able to ride away from Van Impe and claim his 3rd high mountain stage win of the Tour, but he was not able to crack Van Impe as he only won the day by 0:12 seconds, essentially meaning that Van Impe had won the Tour. Stage 21 was a return to the flatlands and was decided in a bunch finish in which Maertens continued his dominance by claiming his 7th stage win. Stage 22 was a split stage, and the final day of the race. First up in stage 22A was a brief 6 km time trial around the Champs-Élysées, and then for the 2nd year in a row the Tour would end with a circuit finish around the Champs-Élysées, beginning to build a tradition which would endure up to the present day. The only thing to be decided during the time trial was the 3rd and final podium position as Poulidor and Delisle had been tied for 3rd place since Puy-de-Dôme with both of them 12:15 behind Van Impe, and the Italian rider Riccomi just a few seconds behind the two of them. Delisle finished in 6th place while Poulidor tied for 2nd place with Zoetemelk meaning Poulidor would make the podium for the 8th time in his brilliant career, an impressive feat considering he was 40 years old. Winning the stage was Freddy Maertens, tying him with Charles Pélissier and Eddy Merckx, who did so twice, as the only riders in Tour history to win eight stages in a single tour. This was also the 3rd time in this Tour that Maertens had won back to back stages.\nThis meant that Maertens would be able to break this record if he were able to claim victory on the final stage. He found himself in good position in the front of the pack, but he came up just short having to settle for 2nd place as Gerben Karstens put the finishing touch on what, for him, had been a very successful Tour. Enrique Martínez Heredia won the young rider classification, the intermediate sprints classification went to Van Impe's team captain Robert Mintkiewicz, the overall combativity award went to Raymond Delisle and the victory in the points classification went handily to Freddy Maertens. Van Impe normally competed for the mountains classification and he nearly won it yet again as he and Giancarlo Bellini went back and forth for the lead seven different times but in the end Bellini won the award by a single point 170 to Van Impe's 169. On the podium in 3rd place was Raymond Poulidor, in 2nd place was Joop Zoetemelk as Lucien Van Impe claimed the final yellow jersey as winner of the general classification of the 1976 Tour de France.\nAftermath.\nLucien Van Impe – this would be the only Tour de France win of his career, although by the time he would retire he won six King of the Mountain awards, tying him the great Federico Bahamontes for the most of all time until the EPO era of the 1990s and 2000s. He was in contention of winning the 1977 edition leading the race on Alp d'Huez when, perhaps ironically, he was hit by a car, and had to wait several minutes for a new bike as the riders who were pursuing him continued right on by.\nBernard Thévenet – would abandon this Tour during the 19th stage at no point ever being a legitimate threat to defend his title from the previous year. He would go on to win the following year however, in one of the closest two way battles in Tour history between himself and Hennie Kuiper.\nJoop Zoetemelk – 1976 would be the 3rd time that Zoetemelk finished in 2nd place. He had the misfortune of the beginning of his career coincide with five time champ Eddy Merckx, and the end of his career collide with five time champ Bernard Hinault. Zoetemelk would wear the maillot jaune for four days in the 3rd week of the 1978 Tour, and six days in the 2nd week of the 1979 edition, only to lose it late in the Tour to Hinault on both occasions. He would win the 1980 Tour de France by his performance midway through the Tour convincing Hinault he would not have survived the mountain stages against him, as an injured Hinault chose to abandon while wearing the Yellow Jersey while just 0:21 ahead of Zoetemelk. Zoetemelk would finish 2nd for a sixth time in 1982, once again to Bernard Hinault.\nFreddy Maertens – would follow his Tour performance by winning the 1976 World Championship, then the 1977 Vuelta a España in an absolutely dominant fashion collecting a monumental 13 stage wins. By 1979 and 1980 however, Maertens had fallen from grace and was basically irrelevant within the cycling world. In fact, in May 1979 Maertens traveled to the United States to find a doctor from outside mainland Europe who could attest that Maertens did not have a drug problem as the media reported he did. The plane Maertens was on landed in New York, but crashed later that day while leaving Chicago killing all 273 people on board resulting in the deadliest crash in American history. Maertens career seemed to be a tragic and sad tale, but in 1981 he staged one of the greatest comebacks in cycling history by winning his 3rd Green Jersey, winning another five stages, and capped it all off with a stunning victory in the World Championship.\nDoping.\nDuring the Tour de France, 110 doping tests were taken. Three cyclists tested positive. After the third stage, Jesús Manzaneque tested positive for doping. Manzaneque received a 10-minute penalty in the general classification and was suspended for one month. After the 13th stage, winner Régis Ovion failed the doping test. He was taken out of the results, and Teirlinck and Panizza, who originally were second and third, gained one place. In the official classification, the other cyclists were not upgraded, so the third place remains unoccupied.\nBernard Labourdette was caught during the doping test, when he tried to cheat.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1976 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. The calculation was changed, to make the competition more accessible for the non-sprinters. There were five types of stages, with respect to how many points could be earned:\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only neo-professionals were eligible, and the leader wore a jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1976, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Raymond Delisle won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 10. This prize was won by Luciano Conati."

        "text": "Steven John Hutchinson (born November 1, 1977) is an American former football guard who played for twelve seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, and was named a unanimous All-American. The Seattle Seahawks selected him in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft, and he also played for the Minnesota Vikings and the Tennessee Titans. A seven-time Pro Bowl selection, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020.\nEarly years.\nHutchinson was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He attended Coral Springs High School in Coral Springs, Florida, and played high school football for the Coral Springs Colts. He graduated in 1996.\nIn 2007, he was named to FHSAA's All-Century Team that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100-year history of high school football.\nCollege career.\nWhile attending the University of Michigan, Hutchinson played for coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1996 to 2000. During his redshirt year in 1996, he moved from defensive tackle to offensive guard, and earned a starting position on the 1997 Michigan team that won the Associated Press national championship.\nHutchinson excelled as a four-year starter, and did not allow a sack during his final two seasons as a Wolverine. He was a two-year team captain, four-year All-Big Ten selection, Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year, and a two-time All-American—including unanimous first-team All-American honors as a senior in 2000. He also won the Jim Parker Award from the Touchdown Club of Columbus, and was an Outland Trophy finalist.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nDrafted in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft by the Seattle Seahawks, Hutchinson spent his first five seasons with Seattle. In March 2006, Hutchinson, a free agent, was designated as Seattle's transition player.\nWhile with the Seahawks, Hutchinson made it to 3 Pro Bowls and earned 3 All-Pro honors. He was also a key lineman who blocked for Shaun Alexander in his 2005 MVP season on the way to the Seahawks appearance in Super Bowl XL, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10. This would be his final game as a member of the Seattle Seahawks.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nFollowing the opening of free agency, Hutchinson signed a controversial offer sheet from the Vikings, $49 million over seven years, which was believed to be the richest contract ever offered a guard at the time. The offer sheet, though, contained a poison pill provision that would have guaranteed his entire salary if he was not the highest-paid lineman on the team.\nAt the time, NFL rules required that if a team signed a player with the transition tag to an offer sheet, the original team had to either match the offer sheet exactly or relinquish their rights to that player. While the tag was not triggered during his time with the Vikings—he was released by the Vikings in March 2012—the Seahawks had recently given tackle Walter Jones a contract richer than the one offered to Hutchinson. Thus, the team would have triggered the \"poison pill\" clause immediately and would have been forced, by NFL rules, to immediately guarantee Hutchinson's entire salary. Since doing so would have destroyed their salary cap, they could not match the offer. Moreover, since they only used their transition tag, rather than naming Hutchinson a franchise player, they received no compensation from Minnesota for their loss. Seattle retaliated, though, by signing Minnesota wide receiver Nate Burleson to an offer sheet containing a similar ploy. Because of this controversy, the NFL banned the use of \"poison pills\". Hutchinson played 59 straight games while with the Vikings, not missing a start.\nOn December 21, 2010, Hutchinson was put on injured reserve by the Vikings. Hutchinson also ended the 2011 NFL season on injured reserve. During the first 11-years of his NFL career, Hutchinson had started in all 157 games that he had played in. However, the Minnesota Vikings announced that they had released Hutchinson on March 10, 2012. On March 14, 2012, Hutchinson met with the Seattle Seahawks to work out a possible deal with his former team.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn March 15, 2012, Hutchinson signed a three-year deal with the Tennessee Titans.\nRetirement.\nOn March 11, 2013, Hutchinson announced his retirement. On February 1, 2020, he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nHutchinson married his high school sweetheart Landyn. The couple have a daughter, Lily, and a son, Luke. Hutchinson keeps a vacation home in Key Largo, Florida. He is an avid hunter and fisherman. Hutchinson and his family now reside in Nashville, TN where his wife had a retail store that was reportedly unsuccessful and closed in 2022. The store became a subject of discussion online after it was found out that a PPP loan was issued, and the Hutchinson’s have been suspected of misusing these funds. His family became close with Vikings legend John Randle's family in Seattle and remain good friends."

He played in the National League (NL) for the New York Giants (1908) and St. Louis Cardinals (1910–13), and in the Federal League (FL) for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops (1914–15) and Baltimore Terrapins (1915). Evans batted and threw left-handed.\nEarly life.\nEvans was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was known as Steve, but the origins of that nickname are unclear. Evans entered professional baseball in 1907 with Dayton of the Class-B Central League.\nMajor league career.\nEvans made the major leagues with the New York Giants in 1908, but he played in only two games. He spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, serving as their starting right fielder from 1909 to 1913. He jumped to the FL for 1914 and 1915, which were his last two seasons in the major leagues. He led the FL in triples (15) in 1914 and in doubles (34) in 1915.\nIn an eight-season major league career, Evans posted a .287 batting average with 32 home runs and 466 RBI in 978 games played. He added 478 runs, 963 hits, 175 doubles, 67 triples and 86 stolen bases.\nHe led the NL in being hit by pitched balls each year from 1910 to 1912, setting a single-season record of 31 in 1910 that stood for 61 years before it was broken by Ron Hunt. He also set the record for being hit by a pitch in a single game, being hit three times in a game against Brooklyn.\nEvans was known as a jokester on the baseball field. Sportswriter Fred Lieb said that Evans was \"one of baseball's delightful screwballs\". During one game, he took the field holding a parasol, then sat on a stool before lighting a cigarette. Evans's demeanor may have irritated Giants manager John McGraw in 1908 and contributed to Evans's short stay in New York. However, when McGraw assembled a team for a 1913-1914 baseball world tour, he invited Evans to play. Another baseball cutup, Germany Schaefer, also joined that team, and McGraw may have invited them for their ability to charm the fans and relax their teammates.\nDeath.\nEvans died at home in Cleveland in December 1943."

        "title": "Bowling action",
        "text": "In the sport of cricket, the bowling action is the set of movements that result in the bowler releasing the ball in the direction of the batsman.\nThe bowling action can be broken down into a number of parts:\nThere are certain principles that apply to all parts of the bowling action, such as balance, athleticism and keeping the movement flowing in a narrow corridor directed towards the batsman.\nCoaching books describe idealised bowling actions. But good coaches are well aware that many successful bowlers employ their own unique styles and some give birth to new, improved technique (for example, Bart King). The above links all describe the most commonly taught techniques.\nApproach.\nThe approach is the motion of the bowler prior to bowling the ball. It is also known as the run-up.\nA spinner's approach differs from that of a medium pace or fast bowler, but certain principles remain the same:\nThe strides of the bound, back foot contact, front foot contact and the first stride of the follow through should all be in line to give a balanced action that flows towards the target. Medium pace and quick bowlers usually employ a straight approach that is aligned toward the target. Spin bowlers, on the other hand, tend to have more varied approaches.\nAs a general rule the different types of bowlers use similar approaches to each other. For example, Spin bowlers tend to have very short run-ups, some even approach the bowling crease at a walking pace. Medium bowlers tend to run up off a short run-up of about 10 paces or so. Fast bowlers tend to have long, rhythmical run-ups to allow them to develop momentum which adds to their ability to bowl the ball at high speeds.\nOther recommended elements of the approach are:\nThe ball must be delivered from behind a bowling crease, but preparation to bowl the ball can be done any way the bowler wishes. Every different bowler approaches the wicket in a personal way, and so there can be many and varied \"run-ups\".\nThe term \"run-up\" can also refer to the area where the bowler runs during his run-up.\nBound.\nThe bound is a jump that allows the bowler to transition from the run-up to the back foot contact position. For a chest on bowler not much transition is needed. So, many chest on bowlers have a low, short bound. In contrast, side on bowlers need to rotate their bodies through ninety degrees and so tend to have a longer, higher bound. A high bound can lead to the knee on the back foot collapsing and so lose momentum.\nDelivery stride.\nDelivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released\nor not. It starts when the bowler's back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot\nlands in the same stride.\nBack foot contact.\nBack foot contact is position of the bowler at the instant when the back foot lands on the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right-handed bowler, the back foot is normally the right foot.\nAn alternative name for back foot contact is \"coil\".\nTo avoid back injury it is important that the hips and shoulders are aligned at back foot contact. This can be done in any of the following positions:\nAn action that fails to align hips and shoulders at back foot contact is termed a \"mixed action\".\nFront foot contact.\nFront foot contact is the position of the bowler at the moment when the front foot hits the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right-handed bowler the front foot is normally the left foot.\nPoint of release.\nThe point of release is the position of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.\nFor fast bowlers at the point of release the back of hand will be facing in the opposite direction of the batsmen facing the pending delivery. The front of the upright wrist and tips of the index and middle fingers all point to the target. For spin bowlers the wrist may well be at various angles at release point. This is because one is trying to create drag on a particular side of the ball, not propel it straight as per the section above.\nFollow through.\nThe follow through is the motion of the bowler after releasing the ball."

He was also part of the Pakistan hockey teams that won silver medal in 1975 Men's Hockey World Cup while gold medal in 1978 Men's Hockey World Cup and 1982 Men's Hockey World Cup. He also included in Pakistan hockey teams that won gold medals in the 1974 Asian Games in Tehran, the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok and 1982 Asian Games in Delhi. His remarkable ball control with enormous speed was a rare and lethal combination that can be seen in Hockey. With his thrilling runs, body dodges, and large leaps he could beat and outpace his opponents and penetrate any defense to score goals or create scoring opportunities for his team mates. \nHis brother Kaleemullah Khan also played for the national field hockey team of Pakistan. Samiullah retired from international hockey in 1982 while he was the captain of the Pakistan team. Samiullah Khan later managed the Pakistan Hockey Team, quitting in 2005.\nSamiullah is also the nephew of Motiullah, who was a member of the 1960 Rome Olympics gold-winning Pakistan hockey side."

        "title": "Ice hockey goaltending equipment",
        "text": "In ice hockey, the goaltender wears specialized goaltending equipment to protect themselves from the impact of the puck, and to assist in making saves. Ringette and rinkball goaltenders use the same equipment with some exceptions. This article deals chiefly with the sport of ice hockey.\nMost modern goaltending equipment is made from hydrophobic synthetic leather and nylon on the outside and dense closed-cell foams and plastics inside. In the past, pads were often made out of leather and stuffed with horse hair. Professional pads were stuffed with deer hair, which is hollow, giving more protection.\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) specifies maximum dimensions of goaltending equipment to prevent goaltenders from having an unfair advantage. Many other professional and non-professional leagues adhere to equipment size regulations based on International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) rules.\nBlocker.\nThe blocker consists of a glove with a rectangular board attached to the backhand side. The board is usually curved up at one end, which is designed to help control the deflection of the puck and will create a tougher angle on a shot if a goaltender uses the shaft-down technique. The blocker is worn on the hand that holds the stick, so a right-handed goaltender wears the blocker on the right hand, and a left-handed goaltender wears it on the left hand. This is called a \"full right goalie\" as the goaltender wears the catch glove in the right hand. A blocker is sometimes called a \"waffle\", and less commonly as a \"domino,\" in reference to older models, which were covered with real leather, but had holes cut in the leather to save weight, giving the blocker a waffle-like appearance. The placement of the palm on the back of the blocker varies though it has been traditionally placed in the middle. Newer models tend to place the palm further to the inside of the glove in order cover more of the net. Typically, the goaltender wears only one blocker. However, near the end of his career, retired goaltender Dan Blackburn played with two blockers after nerve damage rendered him incapable of closing his glove hand.\nCatcher.\nThe \"Catcher\" or \"glove\" is the glove worn on the free hand. It is similar to a baseball mitt, but has additional padding to protect the lower forearm, wrist, palm, fingers and thumb, and has a deeper pocket. The first goaltender trapper, worn by Reid Miller in 1948, who played for the Wadena Wolverines and the North Stars, was a baseball first baseman's mitt. Common variations among trappers include the pocket angle or \"break\": this refers to the angle at which the glove closes, usually measured from 60 - 90 degrees. Trappers tend to be one of the most cared-for pieces of equipment for the goaltender. In order to prevent what is called a \"pancake pocket\", goaltenders often deepen the pocket by strapping objects inside the glove when not in use. The trapper's fit is extremely important as well as the goaltender's sense of the pocket and angles of the trapper. As a result, transitioning to a new glove may be difficult because of the significant break-in time. The total circumference of a trapper is 45 inches, modified down from 48 inches.\nChest and arm protector.\nThe \"chest and arm protector\" or \"arm and body pad\" is designed to protect the chest, shoulders, arms, and collarbone area from the impact of pucks and is worn under the hockey jersey. The chest and arm protector has continually become more protective in recent years. In the early days of goaltending, it was much smaller and less protective, consisting mostly of thick felt. In effect, these pads were little better than what baseball catchers wear today. With the advent of better materials such as high density plastics and foams, chest protectors can be made to protect the body from injury. However, even with modern chest protectors, goaltenders still receive bruises and other minor injuries from pucks that hit them in the torso.\nJockstrap.\nA goaltender jock with a cup pocket, which protects the pelvic area, is more protective than a common jockstrap with protective cup, though it generally uses the same internal plastic cup, or maybe a bit larger. The jock has padding over the internal plastic cup and additional padding from the top of the cup to the waist. Many modern jocks use two cups, one in front of the other, in order to provide more protection. Instead of a jock, female goaltenders wear a pelvic protector known as a \"jill\".\nLeg pads.\nGoaltenders wear special leg pads to protect their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved significantly over the years. The earliest leg pads were very similar to the cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair and sometimes Kapok, a material that was used in life preservers on ships. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a \"skip-over roll\", was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to the very top of the leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goaltender pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight and less saturation from water, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the \"box\" style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the \"box\" style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the \"butterfly\" position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than and can be no longer than . The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.\nMask.\nThe first modern goaltender mask was pioneered by professional goaltender Jacques Plante. Early masks were constructed from fiberglass and were molded to the shape of the wearer's face. These became less popular in the year 1969 in North America when a series of severe and career ending injuries struck down many NHL goaltenders using molded masks and prompted the Canadian Standards Association to outlaw molded masks in 1978. Assuredly, it was also Vladislav Tretiak's brilliant play during Canada-USSR 1972 Summit Series, that North American players first began to notice the superiority of the helmet/cage-type mask as opposed to the form-fitting fiberglass model, especially in terms of increased vision. Another significant advance in mask design came during the 1974-75 season, when goaltending great Tony Esposito, who had experienced puck and stick injuries to his eyes, fitted a steel cage over the eyeholes of his molded mask and crafted a fiberglass extension to protect the top of his head, thereby setting the groundwork for the next step in mask evolution, the modern goaltender mask, commonly referred to as the \"hybrid\" mask.\nToday, most goaltenders utilize hybrid masks made of fiberglass, kevlar, carbon fiber, and other composite materials. Modern masks have a large cutout in the eye and nose area covered by a steel or titanium cage. \nMany goaltenders are able to be identified by the custom artwork airbrushed on their masks. Some maintain the same theme throughout their career, changing the colors to match their team's colors. Examples include Curtis Joseph's Cujo, Ed Belfour's eagle, Félix Potvin's abstract cat design, Martin Brodeur's generic Devils mask, or Patrick Lalime's Marvin the Martian. Some goaltenders have more generic team-specific artwork, while others vary the artwork over the course of their careers.\nAn alternative to the mask, is the earlier mentioned \"bird-cage\" helmet and cage combo, which consists of a wire facemask attached to a standard hockey helmet. This became popular during the 1970s since a cage provides better sightlines than a molded fiberglass mask. Its popularity peaked during the 1980s, yet started to decline during the 1990s, as hockey equipment manufacturers discontinued the production of helmets and cages favored by goaltenders. By the turn of the 21st century, only a few professional goalies still wore a helmet/cage combo. Included in this small group were Chris Osgood of the Detroit Red Wings and Rick DiPietro of the New York Islanders in the NHL, Martin Prusek of Dinamo Riga in the KHL, and Marco Bührer of SC Bern in the Swiss National League A. Dominik Hašek also wore the helmet/cage combo for the duration of his career.\nThere were various helmet/cage combinations used by professionals. One was the Cooper SK600 helmet with the Cooper HM30 cage (worn by Ken Wregget and Billy Smith). Another was the Cooper SK2000 helmet with either the Cooper HM30 cage (previously used by Osgood and Dan Cloutier) or the Cooper HM50 cage (previously used by Hašek). Another one was the Jofa 280 Helmet with the 260.51 cage, which was last worn by Arturs Irbe. Don Beaupre wore a Cooper SK600 with a Jofa 260.51 cage. After Nike acquired Cooper and consolidated it as Nike Bauer, the SK2000 and HM50 were discontinued, while the HM30 was marketed as a field hockey mask (and subsequently discontinued in 2004). Jofa eventually phased out the 280 helmet and its respective cage, but now offer the RBK 3K helmet and 287 cage for the European market since consolidating with Reebok.\nThere are currently two models of goaltender masks which are both available to the North American market and based on the helmet/cage combination. The first model is the Hasek Pro Style 357, manufactured by the Warwick Mask Company, which follows the traditional helmet/cage style of masks. Current users of these helmets include Prusek and Bührer, while Hašek used this model from the 2001-02 season up to his retirement. The second is the Mage, manufactured by Sportmask. The difference between the Mage and other helmet/cage combinations is that the Mage's cage attaches to a helmet with a back plate as opposed to a helmet that's enclosed. Mage users include Florida Panthers goaltender Tim Thomas and Genève-Servette HC goaltender Tobias Stephan.\nPants/Breezers.\nGoaltenders' pants are similar in appearance to the pants that forwards and defensemen wear. Goaltender pants are heavily padded all down the front and sides, with a tailbone protector incorporated into the rear of the pant. They also have protective foams on the inner thigh for increased protection from shots. They also have attachments for the options of suspenders.\nSkates.\nGoal skates differ from regular hockey skates: the blade is longer, wider, and flatter to provide the goalie with more stability and to prevent the blade from bending when hit by shots. The blades are usually made from stainless steel, carbon steel, or titanium nitride. The blade holder, which is molded to the cowling or affixed directly to the boot, was historically shorter vertically so that the goaltender is lower to the ice. Modern goalie blades have become much taller to give goalies the ability to have a wide stance without losing their blade edge contact with the ice. The boot does not have a tendon guard, which is the piece of a regular hockey skate that extends up the back of the ankle to protect the Achilles' tendon. Finally, the boot used to be inside a rigid cowling to protect the foot from direct impact. The current trend is to remove the cowling. Cowlings made the skates wider, especially at the bottom of the boot. When the modern goaltender went into a deep \"butterfly\" position, to see between the players in front of him, the cowl would lift the blade off the ice. The new goaltender skate is made out of newer materials, allowing the boot itself to provide the needed protection. The cowlings are being phased out of professional play.\nStick.\nThe special hockey stick goaltenders use has a blade that is approximately wide. The lower of the shaft is widened to provide more blocking surface. This area is called the \"paddle\". Although traditional goaltender sticks were usually made completely of wood, most modern sticks are reinforced with graphite and fiberglass and the paddle and blade are injected with foam to make them lighter. Recently, manufacturers have begun to produce sticks made completely from composite materials, which are lighter. However, it may be argued that composite sticks are less durable than their wooden counterparts. While these sticks are widely sold, most professional goaltenders have continued to use the foam core paddle-wood shaft type, even though it may be painted to look composite. The reason is both durability and the ability of the \"old\" style construction to absorb shock. Player sticks are made to transmit feeling (i.e. of the puck) to the player's hands when stickhandling. Goaltenders need the stick to absorb the shock of the puck impact when making a save."

        "title": "Powerplay (cricket)",
        "text": "A powerplay is the name for the fielding restrictions in limited overs cricket. It was first introduced in 1980-81 Australian season. Fielding Restrictions has been a rule in ODI cricket since 1992. It was renamed as Powerplay by ICC in 2005.\nUnlike Test cricket, the fielders are spread out to save runs in limited overs cricket. The powerplay rules along with a number of other factors, have contributed to the big scores in modern One Day Internationals since 1992.\nRules.\nOne Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 differ in terms of the number of overs where mandatory powerplay rules apply. The rules below apply only when a match is uninterrupted.\nTwenty20.\nIn most domestic leagues and international Twenty20 cricket, the first six overs of an innings will be a mandatory powerplay, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle. Beginning with the seventh over, no more than five fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle. However, in Australia's Big Bash League the Powerplay is only the first 4 overs, with the batters choosing when the same restrictions apply for 2 overs in the second half of the innings, in a period called a Powersurge.\n100-ball cricket.\nThe powerplay restrictions are active during the first 25 legal balls of the innings, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle.\nHistory.\nFielding restrictions evolved through the 1970s, notably in World Series Cricket, and were first introduced in ODIs in 1980 in Australia. The most common rule was for only two fielders to be allowed outside the circle in the first ten overs, then five fielders allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs.\nThe powerplay nomenclature was introduced by the International Cricket Council in 2005, when the fielding restrictions were split into 3 blocks: the mandatory ten overs at the start of the innings and two further five-over powerplays with the bowling team being able to choose the timing of both. In practice though, both were generally taken as soon as possible, effectively leading to a single block of 20 overs of fielding restrictions. To counter this, in 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays.\nFrom 1 October 2011, the ICC brought additional changes to the bowling and batting powerplays. Under the new rules, in a 50-over match, neither of the two five-over powerplays may be taken before the start of the 16th over and both must be completed before the commencement of the 41st over, so overs 11 to 15 and 41 to 50 cannot be powerplay overs. Should either or both teams choose not to exercise their discretion, their powerplay overs will automatically commence at the latest available point in the innings (e.g. in a 50-over innings with one unclaimed powerplay, it will begin at the start of the 36th over).\nOn 29 October 2012, the ICC made further amendments on powerplays, reducing the number of blocks of powerplays from three to two.\nFrom 1992 to 2012, during non-powerplay overs a total of five fielders were allowed outside the circle. This was changed to four in October 2012. Moreover, from 1992 to 2005, two fielders were required in catching positions in the first ten overs. \nFrom 5 July 2015, the ICC further amended the rules, making the whole innings as a composition of 3 powerplays, thus removing the batting powerplay previously introduced. Furthermore, the restriction of two catching fielders on the first powerplay was relaxed."

        "title": "Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.",
        "text": "Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr. is a baseball video game developed by Angel Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game is a follow-up to Nintendo's previous title featuring Griffey, \"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run\". It was released in 1998, and allows players to choose any contemporary Major League Baseball franchise and play through an exhibition, a complete season, or a World Series. Players can also select up to four individuals from any team to compete in a Home Run Derby. The game also features all 30 MLB teams' stadiums. The game was seen as a faster, more arcade-like baseball game compared to its rivaling product, the more realistic baseball simulation \"All-Star Baseball '99\". Nintendo released a sequel the following year, called \"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest\".\nGameplay.\nBatters and fielders abilities are measured with five different statistics: Batting, Power, Speed, Defense, and Arm. Pitchers abilities are measured with three different statistics: Speed, Stamina, and Control. Statistics are measured by a number 1-10, with 1 being the weakest and 10 being the best.\nEvery pitcher in the game has four pitches. The first pitch, which is used by pressing the A button, is always a fastball. The second pitch, a breaking ball, is thrown by pressing the B button. Pitches thrown with the B button include curveballs, sliders, and screwballs. The third pitch is the changeup, and is used by pressing the Z button and the A button simultaneously. The fourth and final pitch is the \"special.\" Special pitches include the super fastball, super changeup, splitter, cut fastball, and knuckleball. The special pitch is used by pressing the Z and B buttons at the same time.\nBatters use the analog stick to move a batting circle to where the pitch is shown to go before it reaches the plate. The batter then presses A to swing. If the batting circle is placed where the ball is thrown, and the swing is on time to when the pitch goes over the plate, the ball will be hit. This feature can be turned off by changing the batting style to classic in the Options menu.\nBaserunning on offense and throwing to bases on defense is controlled by the C buttons. The button pressed corresponds to the base (e.g. the right C button is pressed to go to 1st base, up to go to 2nd base, etc.).\nThe game accounts for injuries and real time fatigue, seen most clearly through pitchers. This is especially true if the pitcher uses their \"special\" pitch too often.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was originally due for release in the third quarter of 1997, but was pushed back to 1998.\nThe music was composed by Steve Adorno of the groups GQ, Devoshun, Seguida ny Latin Rock. On it he played drums, keys, guitar, and funk bass.\nReception.\nThe game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings."

        "title": "British Open Championship Golf",
        "text": "British Open Championship Golf is a 1997 sports video game developed and published by LookingGlass Technologies. A simulation of The Open Championship, it allows the player to engage in multiple forms of golf, including stroke play and fourball. The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time. Announcer commentary is provided by actor Michael Bradshaw and \"Wide World of Sports\" host Jim McKay.\n\"British Open Championship Golf\" was the third self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title \"Mean 18\". The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as \"Links\" and \"PGA Tour\".\nThe game was a major commercial failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.\nGameplay.\n\"British Open Championship Golf\" is a three-dimensional (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt to hit a ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.\nBefore making a shot, the player may select a club and adjust the general direction of the swing. As with other golf games, a \"swing meter\" is used to simulate the act of swinging the club. The player clicks three times: first to initiate the backswing, which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to \"snap\" the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on the far end of the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots. The crowd reacts to the player's shots, and Tournament mode features announcer commentary that analyzes the match overall; it can frame the player's current performance in the light of past shots.\nThe player may choose one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie provides information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.\nDevelopment.\nLooking Glass Technologies began developing \"British Open Championship Golf\" in 1995. The project was led by Rex Bradford, designer of the influential 1986 golf title \"Mean 18\". He had also worked on earlier Looking Glass games, such as \"\". Bradford decided to revisit the golf genre because he felt that other games did not recreate the structure or capture the atmosphere of golf tournaments; he complained that golf titles took place on \"The Lonely Planet of Golf\". The team sought to fill this perceived void by more accurately simulating the tournament experience, with a particular focus on crowds, commentary, atmosphere and the caddie. Bradford believed that these elements recreated \"the television-style ambiance of being in that moment.\" Graphically, a focus was placed on buildings and animated objects, in order to make up for the less spectacular nature of links courses. The game's environments were generated with the same stereophotogrammetry techniques used to create the landscapes in the company's earlier \"Flight Unlimited\". The team's reproduction of the Old Course at St. Andrews was the first ever authorized for a video game.\nLooking Glass officially announced \"British Open Championship Golf\" on July 18, 1996. Coinciding with this news, the company launched a website to cover The Open Championship of 1996; it detailed both current events and the history of the tournament and its courses. According to Bradford, the company was \"hoping to make a splash\" with the game, which was placed in competition with popular series such as \"Links\" and \"PGA Tour\". He noted the quality of these titles, and stated that, had the team not been trying to innovate, they would not have attempted to compete in the genre. Looking Glass revealed in November 1996 that Jim McKay, host of the \"Wide World of Sports\", would provide color commentary for the game. Actor Michael Bradshaw was hired as the play-by-play announcer. The pair recorded more than 5,000 lines of dialogue in total. In January 1997, Looking Glass and Eidos Interactive announced a four-year partnership. As a result, \"British Open Championship Golf\" was distributed and marketed in North America and published in Europe by Eidos. However, like \"Flight Unlimited\" and \"Terra Nova\", the game was self-published in North America by Looking Glass. In March 1997, near the end of the game's development, part of the team moved to \"\"; this included Mark Lizotte, who became that game's lead artist. \"British Open Championship Golf\" was released on April 30, 1997. That May, Looking Glass collaborated with golf website GolfWeb to host a \"Virtual British Open\" tournament. Players competed in the game to win a trip to The Open Championship in Scotland, complete with \"air fare, hotel accommodations and spending money.\"\nReception.\n\"British Open Championship Golf\" was a commercial failure. Following its release, Looking Glass ceased self-publishing operations and closed a division of the company, laying off a group of employees that included Warren Spector. Writing for \"Maximum PC\", T. Liam McDonald called the game \"a costly bomb that bled the company.\" Looking Glass employee Tim Stellmach later characterized it as \"a disaster\". However, it was generally well received by critics. A reviewer for \"Next Generation Magazine\" hailed it as \"one of the best golf games in years\", praising the atmosphere and calling the graphics \"among the best ... around.\" The writer cited the game's lack of a course editor as its main downside, and summarized, \"If you are looking for a golf simulation, this one delivers.\" \"PC Magazine\"s Shane Mooney highlighted its \"outstanding graphics\" and detailed course reproductions, and noted that it \"[immerses] players in a realistic tournament atmosphere.\" The writer considered the inclusion of only two courses to be the game's \"one major drawback\".\nJeff Guinn of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" called its graphics \"exceptional\", and considered the game to be \"far from the traditional aim/swing links pseudo-challenge.\" However, he found the game extremely difficult, thanks to its faithful reproductions of the challenging Old Course and Royal Troon. As a result, he considered the game to be ultimately \"too much of a good thing.\" A writer for the \"Telegraph-Herald\" praised its courses, and stated that its gameplay was a \"state-of-the-art simulation\". The reviewer believed that the tournament atmosphere had been \"re-created faithfully.\" Gary Whitta of \"PC Gamer US\" praised the game's graphics and atmosphere. While he liked its gameplay, he noted that it lacked the genre refinements seen in \"Links LS\", a decision he believed would appeal to genre novices but not to veterans. He disliked Michael Bradshaw's commentary, but praised Jim McKay's for \"adding much to the overall feel.\" Ending his review, Whitta summarized it as \"one of the most user-friendly, accessible, atmospheric and attractive golf games out there\".\nPeter Smith of \"Computer Games Magazine\" found the game's swinging mechanics challenging, and noted that \"making a dead-on accurate shot much more difficult than in any of the other golf games out there.\" He found the mechanics of the putting green to be badly designed, which he cited as \"an incredibly serious flaw that takes \"British Open Championship Golf\" out of contention for the gold cup.\" Ultimately, he recommended \"Links LS\" and \"Jack Nicklaus 4\" over the game, but suggested that future installments or patches might fix the issues. \"Computer Gaming World\"s Scott A. May wrote that \"the game is solid, but ... somewhat unspectacular\" compared to \"Jack Nicklaus 4\" and \"Links LS\". He stated that the links courses gave the game \"a somewhat desolate look and feel\", and that, \"Historic or not, the scenery is downright dull\". The reviewer considered Jim McKay's commentary and the simulated physics to be the game's high points, and he believed that, \"More so than any other golf sim, the reactive crowd and interactive caddie are ... totally integrated into play.\" He summarized the game as \"a very good simulation\" that was somewhat deflated by its lack of multiplayer, course editing and match replays."

        "title": "1999–2000 UEFA Champions League",
        "text": "The 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League was the 45th season of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier European club football tournament, and the eighth season since its rebranding from the \"European Champion Clubs' Cup\" or \"European Cup\". The competition was won by Real Madrid, who clinched a historic eighth title win by beating fellow La Liga side, Valencia in the final. The final was hosted in the Stade de France in Paris, the city where the original roots of the competition had begun nearly 50 years earlier.\nJust after two years of allowing runners-up of strongest continental leagues to enter the tournament, UEFA went even further and expanded the tournament to up to four strongest teams from Europe's top national leagues. As a result, the tournament was a stark contrast from 1996–97 (which took place only three years prior) where only top national champions and title holders participated.\nThe competition was dominated by the Spanish teams, with three of the four semi-finalists coming from Spain, namely Real Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona. The final between Real Madrid and Valencia marked the first time that both finalists in the competition had come from the same country.\nManchester United were the defending champions, but were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.\nChanges to the competition format.\nThe 1999–2000 edition of the Champions League featured a whole different format to the competition. An additional qualifying round was introduced to generate two group stages, firstly with 32 teams – eight groups of four – who played six matches each to reduce the competition to 16 teams for the second group stage, with the eight third-placed teams moving to the UEFA Cup third round. At the end of the second group stage, eight teams remained to contest the knock-out stage.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 71 teams participated in the 1999–2000 Champions League, from 47 of 51 UEFA associations. Liechtenstein (who don't have their own league) as well as Andorra and San Marino did not participate. Additionally, Bosnia and Herzegovina were not admitted due to having no nation-wide champion.\nBelow is the qualification scheme for the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League:\nAssociation ranking.\nCountries are allocated places according to their 1998 UEFA league coefficient, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1993–94 to 1997–98.\nDistribution.\nThe title holders (Manchester United) qualified for the Champions League group stage through their domestic league, thus the group stage spot reserved for the title holders was vacated. Additionally, Bosnia and Herzegovina was not admitted as their play-off for Champions League qualification didn't take place. Due to these factors, the following changes to the default access list are made:\nParticipants.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Champions League title holders).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held in Geneva, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nQualifying rounds.\nThird qualifying round.\nLosing teams advanced to the first round of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup.\nFirst group stage.\n16 winners from the third qualifying round, 10 champions from countries ranked 1–10, and six second-placed teams from countries ranked 1–6 were drawn into eight groups of four teams each. Compared to the two previous seasons, three associations (England, France, The Netherlands) were allowed three teams – the league winner and runner-up from each nation qualified for the first group stage, and the third-placed teams qualified for the third qualifying round – and three associations were allowed four teams (Germany, Italy, Spain) – the league winner and runner-up from each nation qualified for the first group stage, and the third- and fourth-placed teams qualified for the third qualifying round. Nine additional associations were still allowed two teams (Czech Republic, Greece, Norway, Portugal: league winner in group stage; Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Turkey, Russia: league winner in third qualifying round). The top two teams in each group advanced to the Champions League second group stage, while the third-placed teams advanced to round three of the UEFA Cup.\nAIK, Boavista, Bordeaux, Chelsea, Fiorentina, Hertha BSC, Lazio, Maribor, Molde, Valencia and Willem II made their debut in the group stage. Maribor was the first Slovenian side to play in group stage. Germany became the first association to have four teams in the Champions League group stage.\nTiebreakers, if necessary, are applied in the following order:\nSecond group stage.\nEight winners and eight runners-up from the first group stage were drawn into four groups of four teams each, each containing two group winners and two runners-up. Teams from the same country or from the same first-round group could not be drawn together. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nTop goalscorers.\nThe top scorers from the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League (excluding qualifying rounds) are as follows:"

Sri Lanka were scheduled to play five one-day international games and three Test matches in the 2004–05 season, beginning their tour on 26 December 2004, but due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake which hit the island of Sri Lanka hard, the Sri Lankan team travelled home after the first of the One Day Internationals. The Test matches were rescheduled to April, and the remaining four ODIs were played between 31 December 2005 and 8 January 2006.\n2004–05 tour.\n1st ODI.\nNew Zealand won the first match of the series by seven wickets and with 17 overs to spare. After this match however, due to the difference between New Zealand and Sri Lankan time zone the tsunami hit South East Asian countries, including Sri Lanka; spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan missed being hit by the tsunami by twenty minutes . Concerns for relatives led the Sri Lankan team to head home . The Test match series was postponed until April.\nIn place of the Sri Lankan fixtures in the 2004–05 season New Zealand played a composite team, the FICA World XI led by Shane Warne. \nThe Sri Lankan and New Zealand Cricket boards rescheduled the one day matches for the 2005–06 season.\n2005–06 tour.\nSri Lanka were coming off a 1–6 series defeat on tour of India in November, while New Zealand lost 0–4 in their most recent ODI series, in South Africa in October. Both teams were in mid-table of the ICC ODI Championship when the series began, with Sri Lanka in sixth and New Zealand in fourth place – though both teams had a 109 points. A loss for either of the teams would place them outside the top six of the ODI Championship, and places in the top six on 1 April 2006 would guarantee an appearance at the 2006 Champions Trophy . New Zealand won the first three of the four matches, but ended up losing the fourth in chase of a winning target of 274, which meant Sri Lanka avoided the whitewash. They did, however, fall into seventh place before playing in the VB Series in Australia later that month.\nPeter Fulton, who had only played one One Day International before this series, topped the run-scoring tables for the four-match series, scoring 264 runs with one century and two fifties. For Sri Lanka, captain Marvan Atapattu top-scored with 175, including a 69 in the final match which gave him the Man of the Match award. On the bowling side, Chaminda Vaas began with a total of two wickets in the first two matches, before taking five for 39 and four for 48 to end with 11 wickets at a bowling average of 15.27, the second-lowest in the series (excluding Nathan Astle, who bowled three overs). No other Sri Lankan bowler took more than three wickets. For New Zealand, Shane Bond took nine wickets, Kyle Mills five and Jacob Oram four, all at an average below 21. Jeetan Patel only played one match, the third, where he was named Man of the Match after a spell of 10–0–23–2, which gave him the lowest bowling average of the series.\nSquads.\nAndre Adams was originally selected, but broke a bone in his right hand before the series started and was replaced by Franklin.\nFleming withdrew from the first One Day International to be with his wife during the birth of his first child. Vettori captained the side in the first match, while Astle was selected as a replacement after being dropped originally.\nMills and Oram withdrew before the third ODI due to injury. Martin and Franklin replaced them, while Astle was dropped for a returning Fleming. Astle did play the fourth ODI, however.\n2nd ODI.\nSri Lanka were put in to bat by New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori, and after going through the first eight overs without losing a wicket, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara were caught in successive overs. Mahela Jayawardene lasted 10 balls before he, too, was caught, and the three New Zealand seamers Shane Bond, Kyle Mills and Jacob Oram had a wicket each. Oram got another in the 15th over, when opener Upul Tharanga was caught behind for 17, before captain and number five Marvan Atapattu rebuilt with Tillakaratne Dilshan. Their partnership lasted nearly 14 overs, as both passed 20, but Atapattu was caught for 35, and seven overs later Dilshan was also caught, for 42. The last four wickets yielded 31 runs, and Sri Lanka were all out for 164 when Muttiah Muralitharan was caught at mid-off for 0 .\nChasing, New Zealand lost Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle for sub-20 scores (Astle facing 15 balls but only scoring two runs), before their third-wicket pairing, who had played a combined total of one ODI before this match, added 95 runs for the third wicket. Jamie How, the ODI debutant, was eventually bowled when he missed a slog sweep off Sanath Jayasuriya, and was out for 58, but Hamish Marshall chipped in with 16 not out in the unbeaten fourth-wicket stand, and New Zealand won by seven wickets with more than 12 overs remaining."

        "title": "International Billiards and Snooker Federation",
        "text": "The International Billiards &amp; Snooker Federation (IBSF) is an organisation that governs non-professional snooker and English billiards around the world. As of January 2020, the organisation is headquartered in Doha, Qatar.\nHistory.\nThe World Billiards and Snooker Council (WB&amp;SC) was established in 1971, following a meeting of a number of national associations at a hotel in Malta during the World Amateur Billiards Championship. The associations were dissatisfied that the Billiards and Snooker Control Council was controlling both the UK and international games. Player and journalist Clive Everton served as the first secretary, and his office served as the first office of the WB&amp;SC. In 1973, the WB&amp;SC renamed itself as the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) and began to control non-professional billiards and snooker championships.\nAims and structure.\nThe aims and objectives of the IBSF are to \"co-ordinate, promote and develop the sports of billiards and snooker on a non-professional level\" and to manage the competitions.\nBy the end of 1984, the IBSF had thirty countries as members. As of January 2020, the IBSF has seventy-three affiliated countries categorised into one of the five Olympic regions: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. The IBSF board of directors has four executive officers (president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer) plus two representatives from each Olympic region. The executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day running of the Federation and are answerable to IBSF members at the annual general meeting, which is normally held during the period of the IBSF World Snooker Championships.\nEvents.\nSource:\nRegions.\n49 Nations:\nIn 2020 Asia Pacific Snooker &amp; Billiards Federation (APBSF) was established in with 6 nations.\nRelationships to other organisations.\nThe IBSF—alongside the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA)—was one of the two snooker-focused organisational members of the World Confederation of Billiards Sports (WCBS). The WCBS is an organisation that promotes cue sports in the form of carom, pool and snooker; one of its aims is to gain the acceptance of cue sports disciplines into the Olympic Games.\nThe WPBSA terminated its relationship with the IBSF on 31 July 2017, over conflicts involving the two organisations' relative leadership positions within WCBS, making allegations of IBSF misconduct. As a result of the split, the WPBSA has revoked the Professional Main Tour cards that were once afforded to the IBSF World Men's and World Under-21 Champions. On 5 October 2017, WPBSA announced the formation of the World Snooker Federation (WSF), with stated goals similar to those of WCBS but with a focus on amateur and professional snooker, and an invitation for regional and national amateur snooker federations to join WSF.\nAs the IBSF and WPBSA were unable to come to a formal agreement, as required by the WCBS, both had their WCBS membership terminated in December 2018. In March 2019, the IBSF was reinstated to the WCBS to represent snooker."

        "title": "Rebound (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, a rebound, sometimes colloquially referred to as a board, is a statistic awarded to a player who retrieves the ball after a missed field goal or free throw.\nRebounds in basketball are a routine part in the game; if a shot is successfully made possession of the ball will change, otherwise the rebound allows the defensive team to take possession. Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on his team's offensive end. A rebound can be grabbed by either an offensive player or a defensive player.\nRebounds are divided into two main categories: \"offensive rebounds\", in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and \"defensive rebounds\", in which the defending team gains possession. The majority of rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (i.e., closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Offensive rebounds give the offensive team another opportunity to score whether right away or by resetting the offense. A block is not considered a rebound.A ball does not need to actually \"rebound\" off the rim or backboard for a rebound to be credited. Rebounds are credited after any missed shot, including air balls which completely miss the basket and board. If a player takes a shot and misses and the ball bounces on the ground before someone picks it up, then the person who picks up the ball is credited for a rebound. Rebounds are credited to the first player that gains clear possession of the ball or to the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score. A rebound is credited to a team when it gains possession of the ball after any missed shot that is not cleared by a single player (e.g., deflected out of bounds after the shot, blocked out of bounds, bounced directly off the rim out of bounds). A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a formality as according to the rules of basketball, every missed shot must be rebounded whether a single player controls the ball or not.\nGreat rebounders tend to be tall and strong. Because height is so important, most rebounds are made by centers and power forwards, who are often positioned closer to the basket. The lack of height can sometimes be compensated by the strength to box out taller players away from the ball to capture the rebound. For example, Charles Barkley once led the league in rebounding despite usually being much shorter than his counterparts.\nSome shorter guards can be excellent rebounders as well such as point guard Jason Kidd who led the New Jersey Nets in rebounding for several years. But height can also be an advantage for rebounding. Great rebounders must also have a keen sense of timing and positioning. Great leaping ability is an important asset, but not necessary. Players such as Larry Bird and Moses Malone were excellent rebounders, but were never known for their leaping ability. Bird has stated, \"Most rebounds are taken below the rim. That's where I get mine\").\nBoxing out.\nPlayers position themselves in the best spot to get the rebound by \"boxing out\"—i.e., by positioning themselves between an opponent and the basket, and maintaining body contact with the player he is guarding. The action can also be called \"blocking out\". A team can be boxed out by several players using this technique to stop the other team from rebounding. Because fighting for a rebound can be very physical, rebounding is often regarded as \"grunt work\" or a \"hustle\" play. Overly aggressive boxing out or preventing being boxed out can lead to personal fouls.\nStatistics.\nStatistics of a player's \"rebounds per game\" or \"rebounding average\" measure a player's rebounding effectiveness by dividing the number of rebounds by the number of games played. Rebound rates go beyond raw rebound totals by taking into account external factors, such as the number of shots taken in games and the percentage of those shots that are made (the total number of rebounds available).\nRebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1950–51 season. Both offensive and defensive rebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973–74 season and ABA during the 1967–68 season.\nNew camera technology has been able to shed much more light on where missed shots will likely land."

        "text": "The University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) volleyball tournament is divided into four divisions, namely men's, women's, boys' and girls'. Volleyball is a mandatory sport in the women's division. The UAAP volleyball tournament was held in the first semester of the school year until the UAAP Board decided to move it to the second semester in Season 69 (school year 2006–2007). This decision was made so that the games can be televised to improve its popularity.\nTournament format.\nThe tournament begins with a double round robin group stage, where a team meets its opponent twice in a season. A semi-finals round composed of the top four teams follows, after which the top two teams meet in the final in a best-of-three series.\nIn the semi-finals, the top four teams based on team standings (and tie-breakers, if applicable) from the group stage battle for a Final Four slot. The two top seeds have a twice-to-beat advantage, that is they must be beaten twice in order to be eliminated. The lower seeds, on the other hand, are eliminated when they are defeated once. The surviving teams face off in the finals in a best-of-three series, where the team which notches two wins takes the championship.\nIf a team wins all of the games in the group stage, the stepladder format is use, where the unbeaten team has a bye to the finals. The third and fourth seeds battle in a single elimination game; the winner of that game will face the second seed which have a twice-to-beat advantage. The surviving team meets the first seed team in the finals. From 2012 to 2015, the first seed team holds a thrice-to-beat advantage (or an automatic 1–0 lead in the finals in a best-of-five series) for sweeping the group stage. From 2016 to 2022, the finals was changed to a best-of-three series, while the rest remains the same. Since 2023, however, the stepladder semi-finals format have removed the twice-to-beat incentives for the second-seeded team, while the unbeaten team still advances to the finals in a best-of-three series.\nList of volleyball champions.\nEarly years.\nThe UAAP founded by FEU, NU, UP and UST in 1938.\nFirst expansion.\nAdamson, MCU, UM and UE added; only Adamson and UE were retained.\nSecond expansion.\nAteneo was accepted as a member in 1978.\nThird expansion.\nLa Salle was accepted as a member in 1986.\nFinal Four era.\nCurrent tournament format introduced. Tournament for juniors' division are added on the second year of implementation of Final Four.\nFinal Four.\nThe Final Four for Volleyball was instituted in Season 56 (1993–94). That year, the UAAP declared that there will be a Final Four in all mandatory sports. In 2004, there was no Final Four since the DLSU Lady Spikers swept the double round-robin and were awarded the championship outright, becoming the only volleyball varsity team in the UAAP to win the championship outright with a 14-0 group stage sweep record. In 2007, following the loss of the UE Red Warriors to the DLSU Green Archers in the Finals series of the UAAP Season 70 basketball tournaments despite UE's group stage sweep, the UAAP Final Four format was modified for elimination sweep cases.\nThe stepladder format was introduced beginning 2008 for all UAAP sports. Until 2015, in the earlier stepladder format, the no. 1 seed team was automatically qualified to a Finals berth with a thrice-to-beat incentive (and thus reformatting the best-of-three series to a 1-0 incentive lead in a best-of-five series). The other three teams in the top four rankings underwent play-off games to determine which will qualify for a Finals berth. Starting 2016, the thrice-to-beat incentive was removed, reverting to a best-of-three championship series for all sporting events in the UAAP (except football, which is a single-game UAAP championship match). Starting 2023, the twice-to-beat incentive for second-seeded teams in the stepladder format was removed. Other Final Four rules still remain in place.\nThe UST men's volleyball team's 14-0 perfect group stage record in 2009 was the first to be recorded in UAAP history, but they played based on the regular Final Four format, becoming the only UAAP varsity team to achieve a perfect 17–0 season sweep record. , the UST Growling Tigers, DLSU Lady Spikers, the ADMU Blue Eagles (men's and women's volleyball teams), and the NU Bulldogs (men's and women's volleyball teams) achieved the 14-0 elimination sweeps record in the Final Four era of the UAAP collegiate volleyball. The DLSU Lady Spikers is currently the only UAAP collegiate volleyball team to complete multiple season-long elimination sweeps within the 2008–present form of the Final Four era, having achieved it twice and currently holding the longest ongoing appearance in the Final Four of UAAP collegiate volleyball (since 2009).\nIn 2014 and 2015, ADMU emerged as the lowest Final Four-seeded volleyball team to ever win the UAAP championship (where they played through the stepladder playoffs format and won over 5 knockout games) as well as the first volleyball varsity team in UAAP history to both win the championship and achieve a perfect 16–0 season sweeps record (from group stage playoffs to championship series), respectively. ADMU also became the first UAAP collegiate team to achieve both the 14-0 group stage and 16–0 season sweeps records for both men's and women's volleyball teams (each at least once), after the former achieved this feat in 2017. In 2022, NU became the first volleyball varsity team in the UAAP since the COVID-19 pandemic to both win the championship and achieve a perfect 16–0 season sweeps record after ending their 65-year volleyball championship drought in the women's division. In 2023, NU became the first school in UAAP history to record season sweeps records in all of the league's 4 divisions of the volleyball tournament after the men's team won their third consecutive (and fifth overall) championship and achieved a perfect 16–0 season sweeps record.\nSeason rankings.\nThe volleyball tournaments in Juniors' division started in Season 57 (1994–1995). The number of schools participating in the girls' division increased to six in Season 76 (2013–14) when Adamson University fielded a team. In Season 77 (2014–15), the number of schools participating in the boys' and girls' divisions increased to seven each as FEU fielded a team in both divisions.\nBelow are rankings per division per team in the Final Four era:"

The others are Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand and Wales. The Commonwealth Games is the only major multi-sport event in which Scottish athletes and teams compete as Scotland; otherwise Scotland participates in multi-sport events as part of a Great Britain team.\nScotland has hosted the Commonwealth Games three times, Edinburgh in 1970 and 1986, and Glasgow in 2014. The inaugural Commonwealth Youth Games were held in Edinburgh in 2000.\nScotland sent a team of 259 athletes and 166 officials to the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, and won 51 medals (13 Gold, 11 Silver and 27 Bronze). After the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, Scotland was seventh in the all-time tally of medals, with an overall total of 451 medals (119 Gold, 132 Silver and 200 Bronze). Scotland's most successful Commonwealth medallist by total medals is swimmer Duncan Scott, with 3 Gold, 2 Silver and 8 Bronze medals from 2014 to 2022. In 2018, Lawn Bowler Alex Marshall became the most successful athlete by Golds, winning his fifth Gold Medal which gave him 6 overall, having also won a Silver at the Gold Coast Games. This was also followed by a bronze in Birmingham 2022. \nOther successful medallists include athlete Allan Wells (a total of 4 Gold, 1 Silver &amp; 1 Bronze in two Games – 1978 &amp; 1982) and Peter Heatly (diving Gold's in three successive Games &amp; 1 Silver &amp; 1 Bronze – 1950, 1954 &amp; 1958). Lawn bowler Willie Wood is the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, missing 1986 because of a dispute over amateurism.\nScotland won its 500th overall medal at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England after runner Eilish McColgan won silver in the Women's 5,000m. These games were also the best performing for Scotland outwith Glasgow 2014.\nCommonwealth Games council and member governing bodies.\nThe Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland (CGCS) is the national sporting organisation responsible for entering a Scottish team in the Commonwealth Games and the Commonwealth Youth Games. It is also responsible for organising bids for hosting the Commonwealth Games. The CGCS headquarters is at Airthrey Castle, on the campus of the University of Stirling.\nMembership of the CGCS consists of representatives of the governing bodies predominantly of sports in the Commonwealth Games programme although membership is open to wider organisations such as Scottish Disability Sport sharing CGS values:\nFlag and victory anthem.\nScotland uses the St Andrew's Cross as its flag at the Commonwealth Games. This flag is common for all sporting teams that represent Scotland as an entity distinct from the United Kingdom.\nFrom 2010 onwards, Scotland has used \"Flower of Scotland\" as the victory anthem. This replaces \"Scotland the Brave\" which was used at previous between 1958 and 2006. Prior to 1958, \"Scots Wha Hae\" was used. The new anthem was chosen in January 2010 by athletes that had been selected to participate in the 2010 games. The shortlist of anthems also included \"Scotland the Brave\", \"Loch Lomond\" and \"Highland Cathedral\"."

After doctors advised her to give up land sports for injuries, she joined her school's water polo team.\nCareer.\nIn 1983, Debbie Watson was selected to represent Australia for her great talent in water polo. Her first international appearance was as a 17-year-old at the 1983 FINA Women's Water Polo World Cup in Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada, where the Australian team finished in third place.\nWith the national squad Watson won gold medal at the 1984 FINA Women's Water Polo World Cup in Irvine, California, United States. At 20 years old, Watson was part of the team that won gold at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid, Spain.\nShe went on to captain Australia from 1991 to 1996, and was voted best player in the world in 1993.

        "title": "Homer Jones (American football)",
        "text": "Homer Carroll Jones (February 18, 1941 – June 14, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants (1964–1969) and Cleveland Browns (1970). During his career, he was known for his considerable size and speed. Jones is credited with having invented the \"spike\" touchdown celebration.\nEarly life.\nJones was born on February 18, 1941, in Pittsburg, Texas. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father was a steelworker.\nJones attended Texas Southern College (now Texas Southern University), a historically black college, and starred in track and field as well as football, running the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes. He was drafted in 1963 by his hometown team, the Houston Oilers of the American Football League, but suffered a knee injury in training camp and was cut.\nNew York Giants and the \"spike\".\nThe New York Giants offered Jones a bus ticket to New York and payment for knee surgery. Known as \"Rhino\" to his teammates, Jones wore uniform number 45 in New York. Having seen players such as Giants teammate Frank Gifford and Green Bay Packers star Paul Hornung celebrate touchdowns by throwing the ball at opposing fans in the stands, Jones decided to come up with his own, safer post-touchdown maneuver. In a 1965 game, after scoring a touchdown, he threw the football down hard in the end zone. He called the move a \"spike\". Modern post-touchdown celebrations, including \"touchdown dances\", are said to have arisen from Jones' invention. Contributing to his choice of action was a new rule for 1965 which would fine a player $500 if he threw a ball into the stands. Jones said the fine occurred to him, so he decided to throw the ball on the ground instead.\nIn 1967, Jones had his best season, catching 49 passes for 1,209 yards, an average of 24.7 yards per catch, and 13 touchdowns, leading the NFL in receiving touchdowns. He was second in the league in combined rushing and receiving yards from scrimmage, behind Leroy Kelly of the Browns. He made the NFL's Pro Bowl that season and the next.\nLater career and retirement.\nIn January 1970, Jones was traded to the Browns in exchange for running back Ron Johnson and veteran defensive lineman Jim Kanicki. The Browns were in the market for a new wide receiver after having traded all-pro Paul Warfield to the Miami Dolphins.\nIn the team's first game of the 1970 NFL season on September 21, 1970, at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Jones returned the second-half kickoff against the New York Jets for a touchdown, a key play in the Browns' 31-21 win over the Jets in front of 85,703 fans. The crowd, officially the largest crowd in Browns' history, was a part of NFL history that evening in the first game played on ABC's \"Monday Night Football\".\nHowever, that touchdown would be the highlight of his one season with the Browns as knee injuries soon caught up with Jones. Soon after being traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in July 1971, he was forced to retire at age 29.\nJones died of lung cancer in Pittsburg, on 14 June 2023, at the age of 82.\nCareer statistics.\nJones finished his career with 224 receptions for 4,986 yards, an average of 22.3 yards per reception, and 38 touchdowns (36 receiving, one rushing, one kick return). His yards per reception total ranks #1 in NFL history among players with at least 200 career receptions."

        "title": "Edwin Jackson (baseball)",
        "text": "Edwin Jackson Jr. (born September 9, 1983) is a German-born American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2003 to 2019 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington Nationals, Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, San Diego Padres, Baltimore Orioles, Oakland Athletics, and Toronto Blue Jays.\nJackson has played for more MLB teams than any other player, having played for his 14th club, the Blue Jays, in 2019, passing the record previously held by Octavio Dotel. Jackson was an All-Star in 2009, threw a no-hitter on June 25, 2010, and was a member of the 2011 World Series champion Cardinals.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in Neu Ulm, Germany while his father, Edwin Jackson Sr., was serving in the United States Army there. He is one of 27 major league players who were born in Germany. He spent three of the first eight years of his life in Germany, had a few years in Louisiana, before spending the rest of his youth in Columbus, Georgia. Jackson attended Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia from 1997 to 2001. While attending Shaw High School, Jackson played outfield for the Raider baseball team. His senior year, Jackson helped lead the Raiders baseball team to the 2001 GHSA AAAA State Championship title over Columbus High School in Columbus, Georgia.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2003–2005).\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers selected Jackson in the sixth round of the 2001 MLB draft. He was originally drafted as an outfielder but the Dodgers converted him into a pitcher. There was a time when Jackson was regarded as one of the premier pitching prospects in baseball (after posting sub-4.00 earned run averages (ERAs) in AA and the majors at age 19 in 2003), but poor showings in AAA and MLB after that season ended his status as a \"can't-miss\" prospect. He made his major league debut on September 9, 2003, his 20th birthday. In that game, he pitched six innings, giving up one run and out-pitching Cy Young Award-winner Randy Johnson to earn his first career major league victory.\nTampa Bay Rays (2006–2008).\nOn January 14, 2006, Jackson and left-handed pitcher Chuck Tiffany were traded to Tampa Bay for pitchers Danys Báez and Lance Carter. In 2006, Jackson pitched in 23 games, mostly in middle relief, and posted a 5.45 ERA in innings.\nIn 2007, Jackson became a full-time starter for the Rays. He began the season poorly, going 1–9 with a 7.23 ERA in 17 games over innings. Jackson managed to rebound somewhat after the All-Star break, posting a 4–6 record and a 4.48 ERA over 15 games, all of them starts. His season highlight came in a start against the Texas Rangers on August 11, in which he recorded a shutout, allowing only four hits and one walk while striking out eight. Jackson finished the season with a 5–15 record and an ERA of 5.76.\nIn 2008, Jackson assumed the number four spot in the Rays' starting rotation out of spring training. He finished the season with a 4.42 ERA. Jackson tied with James Shields to lead the Rays with 14 victories, which also tied the record for most wins by a Rays pitcher.\nDetroit Tigers (2009).\nOn December 10, 2008, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for outfielder Matt Joyce.\nJackson made his Tigers debut on April 7, 2009, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He allowed one run in innings, and received a no decision in Detroit's 5–4 loss. He earned his first victory with Detroit on April 18 against the Seattle Mariners, pitching scoreless innings.\nJackson was selected to represent Detroit in the 2009 All-Star Game along with teammates Curtis Granderson, Justin Verlander, and Brandon Inge. He pitched a scoreless fifth inning for the AL, retiring Yadier Molina, Ryan Zimmerman, and Hanley Ramírez on four pitches.\nAt the end of July, opposing batters were hitting .216 against him, which was the lowest batting average in the league; he was followed by Matt Garza (.222), Jarrod Washburn (.224), and Scott Feldman (.228).\nArizona Diamondbacks (2010).\nOn December 9, 2009, Jackson was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part of a three team trade that brought Austin Jackson, Phil Coke, Max Scherzer, and Daniel Schlereth to the Tigers. Jackson hit his first Major League home run off Jack Taschner and scored the first two runs of his career in the fourth inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 11, 2010.\nOn June 25, 2010, Jackson no-hit his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays, 1–0, at Tropicana Field, becoming the first pitcher to no-hit a former team since Philadelphia Phillie Terry Mulholland no-hit the San Francisco Giants in 1990. It was only the second no-hitter in Diamondbacks' history, the other being Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004, as well as the fourth of the 2010 season, and the third time the Rays had been no-hit in less than 12 months. Jackson's 149-pitch performance included eight walks and a hit batter, and was aided by the defensive performances of Mark Reynolds, Tony Abreu, and Adam LaRoche (whose second-inning home run accounted for the game's only run). Jackson became the first German-born pitcher to throw a no-hitter, the first African American to do so since Dwight Gooden in 1996, and the first African American to do so for a National League team since Bob Gibson in 1971.\nChicago White Sox (2010–2011).\nOn July 30, 2010, the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the Chicago White Sox for Daniel Hudson and David Holmberg.\nWhen the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the White Sox, he became the first pitcher in the Majors to be traded away in the same season that he pitched a no-hitter since Cliff Chambers pitched a no-hitter for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Boston Braves in 1951.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2011).\nOn July 27, 2011, Jackson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays with Mark Teahen for Jason Frasor and Zach Stewart. The Blue Jays then traded Jackson to the St. Louis Cardinals later that day, along with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Corey Patterson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet.\nOn July 29, 2011, Jackson pitched his first game as a Cardinal and threw 7 strong innings, leading St. Louis to a 9–2 win over the rival Chicago Cubs.\nOver 13 regular-season appearances for St. Louis in 2011, Jackson pitched 78 innings in which he struck out 51 batters and walked 23. He allowed 91 hits and 37 runs (31 earned) to accrue a regular-season ERA of 3.58 with the Cardinals. In four postseason starts during St. Louis' successful march to the 2011 World Championship, Jackson posted a 5.60 ERA, issuing 19 hits, nine bases on balls and 11 runs (all earned), including four home runs, over innings.\nJackson declined a one-year salary arbitration offer from the Cardinals for the 2012 season, becoming a free agent in December 2011.\nWashington Nationals (2012).\nOn February 2, 2012, Jackson agreed to a one-year contract with the Nationals. The contract was reported to be worth $11 million and to contain incentive bonuses for achievements such as postseason awards. Jackson went 10–11 with the Nationals with an ERA of 4.03. He became a free agent after the Nationals' elimination from the playoffs.\nChicago Cubs (2013–2015).\nOn January 2, 2013, Jackson signed a 4-year, $52 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. On April 14, he along with Michael Bowden broke the record for most wild pitches in an inning, with 5. He finished the year 8–18 with a 4.98 ERA.\nThe 2014 season was even more dismal for Jackson. He finished the season with a 6–15 record, a 6.33 ERA over IP, and allowed opponents a .302 against him. Over the course of his final 9 starts, Jackson posted a 1–6 record with a 9.95 ERA. His final start against the Los Angeles Dodgers saw him give up 5 earned runs in just of an inning, leading to his subsequent demotion to the bullpen for the remainder of the year.\nJackson entered 2015 competing for a spot in the starting rotation with Travis Wood, but lost after giving up 9 earned runs in 16.1 innings. He began the season as the long reliever in the Cubs bullpen. On July 19, the Cubs designated him for assignment. On July 27, the Cubs released Jackson, eating the $13 million remaining on his contract. The team also owed him the same amount through the 2016 season.\nAtlanta Braves (2015).\nOn August 14, Jackson signed a contract with the Atlanta Braves for the remainder of the 2015 season. He made his first appearance with the Braves the next day. Jackson recorded his first career save in relief of Matt Wisler on October 4, 2015, the final day of the season.\nMiami Marlins (2016).\nOn January 13, 2016, Jackson signed a one-year contract for $507,500 with the Miami Marlins. He was designated for assignment on May 31, 2016, when the team activated Mike Dunn from the disabled list.\nSan Diego Padres (2016).\nAfter signing a minor-league contract with the Padres in June 2016, Jackson was called up and made his first start as a Padre on July 17, 2016.\nBaltimore Orioles (2017).\nOn April 5, 2017, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Orioles. He was called up to the Orioles from AAA Norfolk on June 7, 2017. Jackson was designated for assignment on June 11 and elected free agency two days later.\nReturn to Washington (2017–2018).\nOn June 16, 2017, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Nationals, making this his second stint with the franchise. After several outings with the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, allowing just one earned run in innings of work, Jackson was promoted to the Nationals' major league roster to take injured starter Joe Ross' rotation spot for a July 18 start against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Jackson earned the 4–3 win, spinning seven innings of three-hit ball and allowing his only runs on solo home runs by Mike Trout and Martín Maldonado, and manager Dusty Baker said he would continue starting for Washington. He resigned a minor-league contract on January 11, 2018. He was assigned to AAA Syracuse Chiefs for the 2018 season. On June 1, 2018, the Nationals released Jackson from his minor-league contract after he opted out.\nOakland Athletics (2018).\nJackson signed a minor-league contract with the Oakland Athletics on June 6, 2018, and was assigned to the AAA Nashville Sounds. He was called up to start for the Athletics on June 25, tying a Major League record of having played for thirteen different teams. Jackson earned his 100th career victory on July 30, 2018, in a 10–1 win over the Blue Jays.\nToronto Blue Jays (2019).\nOn May 11, 2019, Jackson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for cash considerations. On May 15, 2019, Jackson made a start against the San Francisco Giants, becoming the first player ever to play for 14 different teams in MLB. Jackson posted an 11.12 ERA through eight games (five starts). On July 16, 2019, he was designated for assignment. On July 20, 2019, Jackson was released.\nReturn to Detroit Tigers (2019).\nOn July 22, 2019, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Detroit Tigers and assigned him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. In two starts for the Mud Hens, Jackson allowed five earned runs on 11 hits in innings, two strikeouts and four walks. On August 9, the Tigers selected Jackson's contract from the Mud Hens and promoted him to the majors. Jackson recorded an 8.47 ERA in 10 appearances with the team. Jackson became a free agent following the 2019 season.\nReturn to Arizona Diamondbacks (2020).\nOn February 2, 2020, Jackson signed a minor-league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Jackson did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was released by the Diamondbacks organization on May 22.\nHigh Point Rockers (2021).\nOn July 15, 2021, Jackson signed with the High Point Rockers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, to help prepare for the 2020 Summer Olympics (contested in 2021). He appeared in 1 game, pitching a scoreless inning out of the bullpen.\nOn September 10, 2022, Jackson announced his retirement.\nInternational career.\nIn May 2021, Jackson was named to the roster of the United States national baseball team for qualifying for baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics. After the team qualified, he was named to the Olympics roster on July 2. The team went on to win silver, falling to Japan in the gold-medal game.\nPitching style.\nJackson is one of a minority of MLB starting pitchers who relies almost exclusively on two pitches, a mid-90s fastball and an effective power slider. His four-seam fastball has good velocity, averaging about 95 mph. He also has a two-seamer with similar velocity. His primary weapon against right-handed hitters is a hard slurve in the upper 80s. Against left-handed hitters, he often uses a changeup (85–89) and occasionally a curveball (78–81)."

        "title": "FIFA World Cup awards",
        "text": " \nAt the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament, several awards are presented to the players and teams who have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game.\nGolden Ball.\nThe Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee (Technical Study Group) and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the \"Silver Ball\" and \"Bronze Ball\" awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by Adidas and \"France Football\". Oliver Kahn is to date the only goalkeeper to have won the award, which he did in the FIFA World Cup 2002. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Lionel Messi became the first player to win a second Golden Ball.\nUnofficial winner.\nThe following players are recognised as best players by the FIFA website. FIFA recognizes the Golden Ball award prior to 1982 only in 1978; it does not recognize Golden Ball awards from 1930 to 1974.\nMedia selections.\nAuthoritative football historian and statistician Ejikeme Ikwunze, popularly called \"Mr. Football\", published a list of the best players in his book \"World Cup (1930-2010): A Statistical Summary\", and it gained the most attention among experts' selections about the best players until 1978. This work is part of the official FIFA library, and received public recognition from his former presidents Joao Havelange and Sepp Blatter. A considerable number of other media agreed with him.\nOn 2 August 1950, Dr. , the editor-in-chief of \"Kicker\" (then \"Sport-Magazin\"), chose his best players of the tournament.\n\"France Football\", the sponsor of Golden Ball and Ballon d'Or, selected the best player of the 1966 FIFA World Cup at that time with \"L'Équipe\", and Bobby Charlton became the winner.\nAfter the 1978 World Cup, Argentinian magazine \"El Gráfico\" held a survey for the best player of the tournament. This was different from the unofficial Golden Ball which is recognised by FIFA.\n\"Guerin Sportivo\" chose their top ten players for the 1990 tournament in Italy.\nIn 1998, the Argentinian newspaper \"Clarín\" provided a brief description of each star player dating back to 1930. Some are controversial decisions as is the case with retrospective awards. The 1998 winner was awarded after the tournament ended.\nGolden Boot.\nThe Golden Boot or Golden Shoe award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe. It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010. FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.\nIf there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player with more assists. If there is still more than one player, the tie (since 2006) is decided by minutes played in the tournament, with the player playing fewest minutes ranked first. A Silver Boot and a Bronze Boot are also awarded for the second and third-highest goalscorers respectively.\nGolden Glove.\nThe Golden Glove award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name \"Lev Yashin Award\" in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper. It was rechristened \"Golden Glove\" in 2010. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002.\nFIFA Young Player Award.\nThe FIFA Young Player Award (\"Best Young Player Award\" 2006–2010) was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany's Lukas Podolski. The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old. For the 2022 World Cup, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 2001.\nIn 2006, the election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.\nFIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the \"Best Young Player\" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament. With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was Pelé, who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas, the best young player at Mexico 1970, and England's Michael Owen, who reached similar heights at France 98.\nThe winner of the award has only been part of the winning country three times. Pelé in 1958, Kylian Mbappé in 2018, and Enzo Fernández in 2022.\nFIFA Fair Play Trophy.\nThe FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.\nThe appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it was a golden trophy based on Sport Billy, a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play. Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure. Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico.\nPlayer of the Match.\nThe Player of the Match (POTM) award picks the outstanding player in every match of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name \"Man of the Match\" in 2002. It was rechristened \"Player of the Match\" in 2022.\nWhile the inaugural two editions were chosen by the technical group, since 2010, Player of the Match is picked by an online poll on FIFA's website.\nTotal awards\"As of 18 December 2022\"\nBy country\"As of 18 December 2022\"\nMost Entertaining Team.\nThe Most Entertaining Team award is a subjectively awarded prize for the team that had done the most to entertain the public with a positive approach to the game, organised through public participation in a poll starting in 1994.\nAll-Star Team.\nOfficial winners.\nThe All-Star Team is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. Since 1994, FIFA decided to add official best squads, chosen by its Technical Study Group under the brand name \"MasterCard All-Star Team\". For 1998, 2002 and 2006, substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full squads.\nUnofficial winners.\nFIFA published the first All-Star Team in 1938, but it never made All-Star Team again until 1990 due to ensuing complaints. In January 1959, the host of 1958 tournament Swedish Federation published an All-Star Team based on 720 answers out of 1,200 experts. In 1990 there was an All-Star Team announced in combination with the Golden Ball ceremony. It was chosen by the same journalists who chose the best player, but this team is still considered unofficial.\nAfter FIFA changed its sponsor from MasterCard to Visa in 2007, it published Team of the Tournament based on statistical data of other sponsors, which evaluates players' performances. FIFA explained these are not official.\nSince 2010, the \"Fan Dream Team\" has been voted by online poll of FIFA website, but FIFA explained this is also not official team.\nMedia's selections.\nMany different newspapers, sports journalists, managers and former players have picked their All-Star teams for the tournaments over the years. Newspapers which picked their All-Star teams include \"Sport-Magazin\", \"Mundo Esportivo, France Football, Associated Press, Estadio, El Gráfico, Goles, Guerin Sportivo, Crónica, El Mercurio, La Prensa, Clarín, La Razón, El País, L'Équipe, Mundo Deportivo, De Volkskrant, La Gazzetta dello Sport, Don Balón, La Stampa, Kicker, Deporte Gráfico, Spotivo Sur, Match, Fußball Woche,\" \"Placar, Shoot!, BBC Sport, Süddeutsche Zeitung\", \"Diario AS\" and \"Marca\".\nSports journalists, managers and former players who picked their All-Star teams include Dr. Friedebert Becker, Gabriel Hanot, Enzo Bearzot, Pelé, Roberto Bettega, Eugenio Bersellini, Giovanni Trapattoni, Massimo Giacomini, Sandro Mazzola, Paolo Carosi, Jimmy Greaves, Pichi Alonso and Johan Cruyff.\nSince the beginning many newspapers gave players points to players based on their performances at the World Cup. Some are based in statistics, but some were just rankings given by experts. Castrol Football has given retrospective rankings to players until 1966 with their expert panel consisting of people such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Arsène Wenger, Marcel Desailly, Cafu, Alan Shearer, Emilio Butragueño, Ronald Koeman, Pierluigi Collina, Ottmar Hitzfeld, Gary Bailey, Peter Stöger, Mohamed Al-Deayea and Stanislav Levý.\nThere are rumours about \"official\" World Cup All-Star teams across the internet. The same teams have been published on many websites including football.sporting99.com, worldcupbrazil.net, talksport and thesoccerworldcups.com. It is unclear where these teams originated, but the earliest they can be found on the internet was in the October of 2011 on the football.sporting99.com website. \nGoal of the Tournament.\nThe Goal of the Tournament award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nUnofficial winners.\nIn 2020 and 2021, FIFA's official YouTube channel made videos of the top ten goals of the following three tournaments."

        "title": "Steal (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, a steal occurs when a defensive player legally causes a turnover by their positive, aggressive action(s). This can be done by deflecting and controlling, or by catching the opponent's pass or dribble of an offensive player. The defender must not touch the offensive player's hands or otherwise a foul is called.\nSteals are credited to the defensive player who first causes the turnover, even if they do not end up with possession of the live ball. To earn a steal, the defensive player must be the initiator of the action causing the turnover, not just the benefactor. Whenever a steal is recorded by a defensive player, an offensive player must be credited as committing a turnover.\nStealing the ball requires good anticipation, speed and fast reflexes, all common traits of good defenders. However, like blocked shots, steals are not always a perfect gauge of a player's defensive abilities. An unsuccessful steal can result in the defender being out of position and unable to recover in time, allowing the offense to score. Therefore, attempting to steal is a gamble. Steals, though risky, can pay off greatly, because they often trigger a fast break for the defensive team.\nThere is no prototypical position from which a player may get many steals. While smaller, quicker guards tend to accumulate the most steals, there are many exceptions. For example, forward Rick Barry led the NBA in steals in 1974–75, and for many years center Hakeem Olajuwon led his team in the category, consistently ranking among the league's leaders, and is the only center ranked in the top 10 all-time in steals. Karl Malone, a power forward, is currently number eleven.\nNBA steals records.\nSteals were first recorded in the NBA in the 1973–74 season, while the rival ABA league first recorded steals during the same season.\nKendall Gill and Larry Kenon are tied for most steals in a regular season NBA game with eleven. Kenon's was recorded on December 26, 1976 while Gill recorded his on April 3, 1999.\nThe most steals by a player in an NBA season is 301 by Alvin Robertson in 1985–86.\nThe NBA's all-time leader for steals is John Stockton with 3,265 in his career.\nThe NBA leader in steals per game (SPG) is Robertson with an average of 2.71 (career, 1250 steals minimum) and 3.67 (season, 125 minimum).\nBaron Davis is the all-time playoff leader in steals per game for a career with 2.28 SPG.\nMaurice Cheeks in the 1979 Playoffs averaged a playoff record 4.11 SPG.\nNotable players in the NBA.\nSome of the greatest defensive specialists in the steals category in the NBA include:"

        "text": "The South Korean national baseball team (), also known as the Blue Wave (), is the national baseball team of South Korea. It has participated in every edition of the World Baseball Classic (WBC), reaching the finals in 2009, and won the WBSC Premier12 in 2015. South Korea also hosted and won the Baseball World Cup in 1982, and has participated in several Summer Olympic Games (winning gold over Cuba in 2008). \nCurrently, South Korean baseball is ranked fiftth in the WBSC World Rankings. South Korea's main rival is Japan, which it has met in several WBC, Olympic, and Asian Baseball Championship games.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2006 World Baseball Classic.\nThe South Korean team playing in the 2006 World Baseball Classic included not just South Korean players based in South Korea, but South Korean players in the U.S. from Major League Baseball. In the Classic, the team played in and won every game they played in Pool A. They advanced to round two, again winning all three games to secure a place in the semifinals. Upon reaching the semifinals, the South Korean government announced that it would waive for the players on the team the mandatory two-year military service required of all young South Korean men. However, at the semifinals, the South Korean team lost to Japan, whom they had beaten twice previously. This led to controversy over the regulations of the WBC concerning the fact that South Korea had to face Japan three times and that it was Japan that was allowed to go to the finals, when it had four victories and three losses up to that point, two of those losses to South Korea, while the South Korean team, which had only one loss and had already beaten Japan twice, was eliminated from the finals.\n2009 World Baseball Classic.\nSouth Korea competed in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, playing the first round in Pool A in Tokyo. South Korea opened the tournament with a 7–0 rout of Chinese Taipei. South Korea then lost to Japan in a 14–2 contest shortened to 7 innings by the WBC's early termination rule. In its third game, South Korea soundly defeated China 14–0 in a similarly shortened contest, securing advancement to the second round and ousting China from the tournament. South Korea won the final Pool A game by a 1–0 win over Japan in order to advance as the Pool A winner. In Pool 1, the round 2 of the WBC, South Korea beat Mexico 8–2 and then went on to beat Japan again 4–1, securing advancement to the semifinals. South Korea beat Venezuela 10–2 to secure a spot on the finals. In the final game however, South Korea lost to Japan 5–3.\n2013 World Baseball Classic.\nSouth Korea competed in the 2013 World Baseball Classic for the third time, playing the first round in Pool B at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taichung, Taiwan, facing the Netherlands, Chinese Taipei and Australia. The Korean team lost the first game against the Netherlands 5–0, but won two next games against Chinese Taipei and Australia. Despite this, South Korea was eliminated in the first round for the first time since advancing to the semi-finals in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. However, even after elimination, South Korea earned their direct qualification to the upcoming 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n2017 World Baseball Classic.\nSouth Korea lost the first game in the first round to surprising newcomers Israel, 2–1 in 10 innings. They also lost their second game against the Netherlands 5–0. They were eliminated for the second time ever, after their poor performance at the 2013 World Baseball Classic, as Israel and the Netherlands advanced to the next round. South Korea took third place in the pool, as it beat Taiwan in 10 innings, 11–8.\nSouth Korea is facing Israel, the Netherlands, and Taiwan in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n2023 World Baseball Classic.\nIn January 2020, the WBC announced the 16 national teams which participated at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, which included South Korea, will automatically qualify for the tournament.\nPremier12 Tournament.\n2015.\nTeam South Korea won the 2015 WBSC Premier12 Tournament.\n2019.\nTeam South Korea came in second in the 12-team 2019 WBSC Premier12 Tournament, which was held in November 2019.

This team won the bronze medal.. At that time, the top four teams (Cuba, United States, South Korea and Japan) advanced to the semi-finals. In the semi-final game, the South Koreans faced the United States team and lost. In the bronze medal match, the South Koreans played against the Japanese and won the game 3–1.\n2008 Beijing Olympics.\nAfter losing 4–3 to Japan at the 2007 Asian Baseball Championships, the South Koreans finished with a 2–1 record and were forced to seek entrance to the 2008 Olympics via the Final Olympic Qualifying Tournament to be held March 7–14, 2008 in Taichung, Taiwan.\nThe South Korean roster, for the qualifying, is mainly professional players from the Korea Baseball Organization and is not subjected to the scheduling conflicts that troubled the teams from Australia, Canada, and Mexico.\nGoing into the tournament rated by the experts as an outsider, or a dark horse at most, South Korea surprised everybody by finishing the group stage in first place with a perfect 7–0 record. The team began its run with come from behind win against heavily favored United States, scoring the winning run in the bottom of the 9th inning with a sacrifice fly. Disappointment soon followed the next game, however, as China (undeniably the weakest team in the tournament) stymied South Korea for most of the game before the game was suspended because of rain in the 6th inning with a 0–0 score. South Korea bounced back the following day with a tightly contested 1–0 victory over Canada, with Ryu Hyun-Jin recording a complete-game shutout. After dispatching their rivals Japan 5–3 in the next game, South Korea finished off China in the continuation of the aforementioned suspended game by winning 1–0 in the extra innings. South Korea then clinched their place in the final four by beating Chinese Taipei 9–8, followed by another surprise victory over heavily favored Cubans, 7–4 (which guaranteed them finishing first place in the group round). The team finished their Round Robin Tournament in style, hammering the Netherlands 10–0 and beating them on mercy rule.\nIn the Semifinal match, the team was once again matched up against their arch-rivals Japan. The first half of the game was very tight as Japan was leading 2–1 going into the 7th inning. South Korea soon tied the ballgame at 2 apiece in the bottom half, then took the lead in the 8th thanks in large part to Lee Seung-Yeop's clutch 2-run home run. South Korea added 2 more runs that inning. South Korea eventually ended with a 6–2 victory. In the finals they overcame the perennial favorites Cuba for the second time in the tournament, surviving a bases-loaded 9th inning situation with a double play to win the game 3–2, allowing South Korea to obtain their gold medal for Baseball.

        "title": "Scottish Cycling",
        "text": "Scottish Cycling, legally the Scottish Cyclists' Union (SCU), is the governing body for cycle sport in Scotland and is part of British Cycling, the national governing body in Britain.\nScottish Cycling is currently located in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Glasgow. It covers road bicycle racing, track cycling, mountain bike racing, cyclo-cross, BMX racing, cycle speedway and time trialing.\nScottish Cycling introduced the MBLA award scheme (previously Scottish Mountain Bike Leader Award), qualification in the UK for leading organised groups on mountain biking rides. This award is now simply called the Mountain Bike Leader Award.\nScottish Cycling has a performance department to help train and develop Scottish athletes. It also enters Scottish teams for events such as the Commonwealth Games, UCI Europe Tour events and UCI Mountain Bike events.\nHistory.\nIn 1931, Scottish cycling clubs formed a loose association named the Scottish Amateur Racing Association (SARA), which concerned itself with organisation of amateur road time trials. In 1936, a meeting of all Scottish clubs resolved to form a new body to represent all road time-trialling. This body, the Scottish Amateur Cycling Association (SACA), took over from the SARA in 1937.\nIn the same year, the National Cyclists' Union (NCU) formed a Scottish section to regulate mass-start road and track cycling. Racing on the open road had been discouraged by the NCU since the 19th century for fear that it would jeopardise the place of all cyclists on the road. Mass races were held on private circuits and consequently there were few races.\nA desire to race on the open road led some clubs to affiliate to the rival British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) in 1945. The following year, the Scottish section of the NCU reformed itself into an autonomous body affiliated to the NCU, the Scottish National Cyclists' Union (SNCU). In response, in 1947, the Scottish BLRC reconstituted itself into the Scottish Cyclists' Union (SCU), an autonomous body affiliated to the BLRC. The inaugural meeting at the Clarion Rooms in Queen's Crescent, Glasgow, on 8 December 1946, resolved to ask the Union Cycliste Internationale, the world governing body, for recognition as the governing organisation in Scotland. The first president was Tom Cook, Member of Parliament for Dundee.\nIn 1952 the SCU, SNCU and SACA amalgamated into a single body, which kept the Scottish Cyclists' Union name. That has since been shortened to Scottish Cycling (SC).\n, the organisation has an annual budget of around £1.7million, around half of which is provided by sportscotland.\nResponsibilities.\nBoard and governance responsibilities.\nThe board's primary responsibility is to lead the strategic direction and policy of the organisation. It is also responsible for reviewing the progress being made towards the strategic aims. The organisation operates on a day-to-day basis through employed staff and a number of sub-committees or individual appointments. Matters of policy and strategic direction, together with matters specifically referred to within the rules, are reserved for the board; other matters are delegated to operational levels. On a day-to-day basis, the chief executive is responsible for all aspects of the organisation and for ensuring the effective delivery of the organisation’s corporate strategy. The current chief executive is Nick Rennie.\nMembership.\nScottish Cycling is a membership organisation and has seen a steady growth in membership over the last few years as cycling continues to grow in popularity. It measures its membership numbers by those who take out a British Cycling membership &amp; live in Scotland. Scottish Cycling campaigns on behalf of all cyclists and has a comprehensive benefits package, local clubs (172) provide additional support for members, organising many activities and promoting many of the 600 plus events."

        "title": "Tennis Borussia Berlin",
        "text": "Tennis Borussia Berlin is a German football club based in the locality of Westend in Berlin.\nHistory.\nThe team was founded in 1902 as \"Berliner Tennis- und Ping-Pong-Gesellschaft Borussia\" taking its name from its origins as a tennis and table tennis club. Borussia is a Latinised version of Prussia and was a widely used name for sports clubs in the former state of Prussia. In 1903 the club took up football and quickly developed a rivalry with Berlin's leading side Hertha BSC. In 1913 the club changed its name to \"Berliner Tennis-Club Borussia\". They won their first city league championship in 1932 in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg and repeated the feat in 1941, this time by defeating Hertha (8–2) in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg.\nAllied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany after World War II. This included football clubs. TeBe played as \"SG Charlottenburg\" in the first season after the war. The club was able to use its name \"Berliner Tennis-Club Borussia\" again from the 1948-49 season. After World War II and into the early 1950s, TeBe emerged as Berlin's top side but were unable to keep up their form and earn selection to the Germany's new professional league, the Bundesliga, formed in 1963. The team played in tier II leagues throughout the 60s and 70s with the exception of two short-lived forays into the Bundesliga in 1974–75 and 1976–77. Most of the 1980s were spent playing in the third tier Oberliga Berlin.\nThrough most of its history \"TeBe\" has been afflicted by financial problems but has always managed to hang on while many other of Berlin's clubs folded or disappeared in mergers. In 1997–98, a deep-pocketed sponsor brought expensive new talent to the team as they made a run at a return to 2. Bundesliga, which they achieved, winning the Regionalliga Nordost. While initially successful, the bid collapsed in 2000 as the team's finances failed. They were refused a license and were forcibly relegated to the Regionalliga Nord (III) where they finished last in 2000–01 and so slipped further still to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV) the following season.\nIn 2000, the club changed its logo to read \"Tennis Borussia Berlin\" which became the official club name in 2005. The club had always been known under this moniker and to avoid being mistaken as a tennis club. It continued playing in the fourth tier – fifth after the introduction of the 3. Liga in 2008 – until 2009, when they won the Oberliga championship and gained promotion again to the Regionalliga Nord. After running into financial difficulties once again, the club went into administration and dropped back down to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (V) for the 2010–11 season. Seen as one of the pre-season favourites for a second successive relegation, they managed to reach the relegation playoffs at the end of the campaign, but finally lost out 3–1 to SC Borea Dresden over two legs to be relegated to the sixth tier of the German football league system, the Berlin-Liga, for the first time in their history.\nSupporters.\nThe fan movement started in the 1970s when TeBe began having its biggest successes. Despite their fall down the leagues the club still enjoys a relatively strong support. The fans consider themselves fiercely Far-Left, and frequently the fans cultivate the club's Jewish traditions as well as actions against antisemitism, racism and homophobia."

        "title": "Anthony Mason (basketball)",
        "text": "Anthony George Douglas Mason (December 14, 1966 – February 28, 2015) was an American professional basketball player. In his 13-year career he played with the New Jersey Nets, Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks, and Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. He averaged 10.8 points and 8.3 rebounds in his 13-year NBA career. Mason earned the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1995 and led the NBA in minutes played in the following two seasons. In 1997, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team and the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. He was selected to the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. Mason was a member of the 1993-1994 New York Knicks team that reached the NBA Finals.\nMason played collegiately for Tennessee State University and also played professionally in Turkey, Venezuela, the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and the United States Basketball League (USBL).\nBasketball career.\nEarly years.\nMason attended Tennessee State University and was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in the third round of the 1988 NBA draft (53rd pick), but was cut shortly afterwards. He then played for the Efes Pilsen basketball club in Turkey and Marinos de Oriente in Venezuela and had brief NBA stints with the New Jersey Nets and the Denver Nuggets.\nIn the 1990–1991 season, Mason played 26 games for the CBA's Tulsa Fast Breakers, with whom he averaged 29.9 points and 14.8 rebounds per game in his only season in the league.\nAlso in 1991, Mason played as a power forward for the Long Island Surf of the USBL. In his one season with the Surf, Mason was named to the All-USBL First Team, averaging more 27.8 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and he set a league record with 28 rebounds in a game. Ed Krinsky, general manager of the Surf, said, \"I really believed he could play in the NBA. He was a huge guy with backcourt skills\". Later that year, Mason was already on the New York Knicks' summer league roster, with Pat Riley as coach. In the year 2000, in celebration of the USBL's 15th anniversary, USBL fans voted on the \"All-15 Team,\" a collection of the best USBL players from 1985 to 2000, many of whom went on to become renowned NBA stars, with Mason included among the 15.\nNBA career.\nNew York Knicks.\nMason signed with the New York Knicks in the summer of 1991. Under coach Pat Riley, Mason blossomed in New York, where he became part of a strong frontcourt alongside Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley and Charles Smith. On March 26, 1993, Mason scored a then career high 30 points, along with grabbing 16 rebounds, in a 105–95 win against the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1994, the Knicks reached the NBA Finals for the first time since 1973, but lost in seven games to the Hakeem Olajuwon-led Houston Rockets.\nMason won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1995. He led the league in minutes played in 1995–96 with 3,457, setting a Knicks team record. In 1996, Mason and Brad Lohaus were traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Larry Johnson.\nCharlotte Hornets.\nIn Mason's Charlotte debut, on November 2, 1996, he recorded a double-double with 18 points and 15 rebounds in a 109–98 victory over the Toronto Raptors. On February 17, 1997, Mason scored a season-high 28 points (on 11 of 11 shooting from the field), grabbed 12 rebounds, and recorded 9 assists in a 124–110 win against the Orlando Magic. In the 1996–1997 season, Mason recorded career high averages in minutes played (43.1), points (16.2), rebounds (11.4) and assists (5.7). He led the league in minutes. Despite a strong personal showing in the first round of the playoffs, averaging 13 points and 12 rebounds a game, Mason and the Hornets were eliminated by his former team, the Knicks, in a sweep. Following the season, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.\nDuring the 1997-98 NBA season, Mason took a slight step back with regards to averages, but was still a solid starter, and helped the Hornets advance past the first round of the NBA playoffs by averaging 19.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game during a 3–1 series victory over their division rival Atlanta Hawks. The following round, the Hornets were eliminated by Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.\nMason missed the entire 1998–99 season due to a ruptured bicep. The following year, Mason averaged 11.6 points and 8.5 rebounds in the 1999–2000 season. On March 31 of that season, Mason recorded a triple-double with a career-high 31 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists, in a 110–101 win against the Raptors. Again despite a strong personal season, Mason and the Hornets would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, this time by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nMiami Heat.\nIn 2000, Mason was traded to the Miami Heat along with Eddie Jones, Ricky Davis and Dale Ellis for Jamal Mashburn, P. J. Brown, Tim James, Rodney Buford and Otis Thorpe. In Miami, although Mason had been brought over by Miami coach Pat Riley to be a role player on what was thought to have been a contender Heat team, the kidney ailment of Alonzo Mourning forced Mourning to sit out and made Mason a starter for the team. Mason would respond by finishing second on the team in scoring, with 16.1 points per game, and averaging 9.6 rebounds. With Mourning and Grant Hill selected but unable to play due to injury in the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, Mason was chosen to represent the Heat in his only selection to an All-Star team. Mason helped the Heat make the playoffs with a 50 win season for the injury-ravaged squad. Mason, however, virtually disappeared in the playoffs, taking only 13 shots and averaging a mere 5.3 points and 3 rebounds in three games. Mason was waived during the offseason.\nMilwaukee Bucks.\nMason signed with the Milwaukee Bucks for the 2001–02 season. In Mason's first season with the Bucks, the team stumbled to a 41–41 record (11 games worse than the previous season) and missed the playoffs altogether. Mason's numbers went down as well: 9.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg. Nonetheless, Milwaukee stuck with Mason for another year, waiving him after the 2002–03 season. Mason retired from the NBA in 2003.\nMedia appearances.\nIn the TV series \"New York Undercover\", Mason appeared in two different episodes, playing himself in one. He also plays a pickup player in the 1996 film \"Eddie\", and himself in Woody Allen's \"Celebrity\".\nIn addition, Mason appears in the Diamond D hip hop video \"Best-Kept Secret,\" dunking his way through the video on a New York City playground basketball court.\nThe Beastie Boys song \"B-Boys Makin' with the Freak Freak\" from 1994's \"Ill Communication\" album mentions him with the lyric \"I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason\".\nThe Notorious B.I.G. song \"I Got a Story to Tell\" tells of the supposed event of the rapper sleeping with the girlfriend of a New York Knick in the player's home, and the fall-out that came with the player returning home while the story teller was still present. The identity of the involved player has been contested since the song's release, with many long suspecting the Knick in question to have been John Starks, Mason's teammate of several years. The player in question was alleged, decades later, to be Mason, by rapper Fat Joe.\nPersonal life.\nMason was born in Miami, Florida, and spent most of his childhood in New York City in the borough of Queens.\nAfter being charged with statutory rape in 1998, Mason pleaded guilty to two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.\nMason's son, Anthony Mason Jr., played on the St. John's University Red Storm basketball team. He completed his eligibility for the 2009–10 St. John's Red Storm, and he went on to try out with the Miami Heat, before playing for teams such as the Sioux Falls Skyforce and Cholet Basket. Another son, Antoine, played basketball at Auburn University after transferring there from Niagara University, where he led the 2012–13 Niagara Purple Eagles in scoring as a redshirt sophomore.\nDeath.\nMason had a heart attack in early February 2015 and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. He died on February 28, 2015, in New York City at the age of 48."

Golf property can be in the ownership of the golf course or in proximity to the golf course. The idea of combining the design of a golf course with a subdivision housing property originated in the US and is now found in many parts of the world.\nIn the United States, there are over 2,000 golf courses with surrounding residential properties. Homes, townhouses, and condos make up the majority of golf properties in the US. In recent years, the concept has gone global with golf communities stretching from Dubai to Australia. Legendary golfers such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Greg Norman have played a key role in the increased rate of development through partnership with national and global home builders including Lennar, Toll Brothers, and others.\nNiche real estate refers to specialized sectors of the property market. Examples include income property, garden real estate, condos, equestrian property, vacation property, farm property, golf property, golf course redevelopment, waterfront homes, beach houses and luxury homes. These are categories in which potential buyers think about the property they seek. "

        "text": "Norway sent 74 athletes to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. At the 2002 Winter Olympics Norway won the most gold medals, and before the Turin games, Norwegian sports officials were aiming for more than the 25 medals they won in Salt Lake City — the president of the Norwegian Skiing Federation Sverre Seeberg was quoted saying he thought Norway would win 25 medals in the skiing events alone (alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, freestyle skiing, Nordic combined and ski jumping). The Norwegian Olympic Committee aimed for Norway to be the best nation measured in the number of gold medals. However, Norway won only two gold medals in the games, the lowest amount since 1988.\nIn addition to the skiing events, Norway also qualified athletes in biathlon, curling, skeleton, snowboarding and speed skating. In addition to IOC qualifying times, the Norwegian Olympic Committee have required that athletes need to place themselves once in the top six or twice in the top twelve in major individual events in the sport to be selected. Curler Pål Trulsen served as flag bearer at the opening ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nNote: In the men's combined, run 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nCross-country skiing.\nOn 9 January the selection of four male athletes for the sprint event was made public. Following the conclusion of the individual events at the 2006 Norwegian Championships, a further thirteen skiers were selected.\nThe Norwegian director of cross-country skiing sport, Bjørnar Håkensmoen, received \"terribly many\" reactions after he announced the team on 21 January, and the following day the newspaper \"Aftenposten\" asked him whether he \"regretted\" not selecting Petter Northug, who had won both the double pursuit and the relay (as part of a team representing Strindheim IL) at the Norwegian Skiing Championship.\nCurling.\nThe curling teams for men and women were nominated following the 2005 European Curling Championships, where Pål Trulsen and his team won gold for men, while Dordi Nordby finished fourth with her team.\nTrulsen's team were the reigning Olympic champions, while Nordby had finished seventh in 2002 and fifth in 1998.\nMen's.\nTeam: Pål Trulsen (skip), Lars Vågberg, Flemming Davanger, Bent Ånund Ramsfjell, Torger Nergård (alternate)\nWomen's.\nTeam: Dordi Nordby (skip), Marianne Haslum, Marianne Rørvik, Camilla Holth, Charlotte Hovring (alternate)\nKey: The hammer indicates which team had the last stone in the first end.\nNordic combined.\nNote: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.\nSki jumping.\nNote: PQ indicates a skier was pre-qualified for the final, based on entry rankings.\nSnowboarding.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates a run that wasn't counted.\nTrivia.\n\"Partly Norwegian\" medal(ist)s\nIn the Norwegian media, two gold and one silver medal won by foreign athletes were humorously presented as part-Norwegian medals, since the medalists in question were of Norwegian descent or family:\nGrateful Canadian XC ski fans\nA large group of Canadian winter sports fans was delighted and impressed by the Norwegian cross-country skiing sports director Bjørnar Håkensmoen's impulsive display of sportsmanship when he handed Canadian skier Sara Renner a ski pole only seconds after her own broke during the sprint relay. Renner and team mate Beckie Scott went on to win the silver medal (while the Norwegians placed fourth).\nTo show their appreciation, a group known as the \"Independent Communications Dealers of Canada\" mounted a \"thank you\" campaign called \"Project Maple Syrup\", organizing a shipment of 8,000 cans of maple syrup to Norway."

        "text": "In baseball, a utility player or superutilityman is a player who typically has the ability to play at every position (or most). They are put in to provide improved defense when their team is winning.\nDescription.\nUtility infielders typically play both second base and shortstop, sometimes also third base, and more rarely first base. A \"fourth outfielder\" is likewise an outfielder who can play all three outfield positions but does not have the hitting skills to be a starting player. Some utility players have the defensive ability to play in both the infield and outfield—recent players in Major League Baseball (MLB) fitting this description include Marwin González, Brock Holt, Cory Spangenberg, and Ben Zobrist.\nPlaying time for fourth outfielders has been called \"erratic and unpredictable\". Often, fourth outfielders are outfield prospects who have not settled on one outfield position when arriving in the major leagues, veteran players seeking additional playing time to extend their careers, or part-time position players who double as designated hitters. Often, the fourth outfielder can be a platoon system against certain pitchers; for example, one outfielder will play only when the starting pitcher is a right-handed pitcher and the other plays only when the starting pitcher is a left-handed pitcher, if one player's performance is better against certain types of pitchers.\nNotable utility players.\nWithin MLB, César Tovar, Cookie Rojas, Bert Campaneris, Shane Halter, Don Kelly, Jose Oquendo Scott Sheldon, and Andrew Romine all played every position (including pitcher) during their respective careers, with Tovar, Campaneris, Halter, Sheldon, and Romine all doing it in one game.\nLuis Sojo is considered to be the classic modern utility player in baseball, as he was a natural shortstop, but could also play third base, second base, first base, and even left field. It was said that in emergency situations, he could even play a bit of catcher.\nIn 1991, the Detroit Tigers' Tony Phillips was the first player to start 10 games at five different positions in the same season.\nIn 2005, Chone Figgins started 48 games at third, 45 in center field and 36 at second, and finished 17th in American League Most Valuable Player balloting.\nSecond baseman Ben Zobrist of the Chicago Cubs has played first base, second base, third base, shortstop and outfield; José Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays has played first base, second base, third base, and outfield; and Josh Harrison of the Pittsburgh Pirates has played second base, shortstop, third base, outfield, and pitcher. All three have been named All Stars while playing multiple positions in their All-Star seasons. Zobrist and Bautista both finished in the top 10 in MVP voting while starting at least 40 games at two different defensive positions.\nIn 2015, Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox was the first player ever to be selected to the All Star Game after starting at seven or more positions before the All-Star break.\nWillians Astudillo of the Minnesota Twins has played every position except for shortstop in his brief major league career, despite having less than a half-season of cumulative experience."

        "text": "The first baseball game in Ireland was held in Dublin in 1874, and it continues to be played by several teams including in the Irish Baseball League. Baseball Ireland is the governing body of baseball on the island of Ireland, covering both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nHistory.\nThe first baseball game in Ireland was played in 1874, when the Boston Red Stockings played the Philadelphia Athletics in Dublin.\nIn 1942 and 1943, several games were played in Belfast among teams of US servicemen.\nThe first organised baseball team in Ireland was the Tramore Sea Lions. The Sea Lions were a youth team in Tramore, County Waterford. The team was organised and coached by local businessman Clive Butterworth.\nThe success of the Tramore Sea Lions in the local community led to the creation of the Waterford Walruses, a team based in nearby Waterford City. In 1962, Clive Butterworth brought two United States Air Force baseball teams to Waterford for an exhibition game. The game was played on Waterford GAA grounds. Butterworth also brought baseball to Dublin in the early 1960s, bringing the total number of Irish baseball teams to three. Within a few years, Butterworth's declining health led to the end of organised baseball in Ireland for nearly three decades.\nIn 2019, the Irish American Baseball Society and Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame announced the creation of the Clive Butterworth Award. The award recognises \"outstanding volunteer service\" among youth baseball coaches in Ireland.\nIreland's National Baseball Team.\nThe Irish National Baseball Team has been in existence since 1996 and has taken part in several major baseball tournaments and tours.\nIreland played its first game in international competition in 1996 against the Czech Republic, losing by a score of 23-2. Ireland's national team has won at least one game in every tournament it has entered including 1996, in Kingston upon Hull.\n\"The Emerald Diamond\", a documentary film released in 2006, chronicled the history of baseball in Ireland and the Irish National Baseball Team.\nCompetition.\nThe Irish National Baseball Team won its first bronze medal at the 2004 European Championships in Germany. In August 2006, the team won the silver medal at the European Championships held in Antwerp, Belgium. They also competed in the European championships held in Vienna in Austria, Stockholm, Karlovac, Abranches, Antwerp, Barcelona and Ljubljana.\nIn 2018, the team won the gold medal at the European Baseball Championship tournament held at the International Baseball Centre in Ashbourne, County Meath. By winning, the team advanced to the next round of Olympic qualifying in 2019. \nIrish Baseball League.\nAlthough the existence of baseball in Ireland is not widely known, the game has been played there since the early 1990s. What began with a few friends playing pickup games on football and rugby fields in Dublin and Greystones, soon grew into a small league.\nIn the years since, baseball has spread elsewhere Ireland, being played in Ashbourne, Clones, County Cork, Shankhill, Greystones, Dublin and Belfast.\nThe Irish Baseball League was founded in 1997. Participating teams come from Dublin, Ashbourne, Belfast, Clones, Cork, Greystones and Portmarnock. Baseball Ireland is the governing body of baseball on the island of Ireland, covering both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nYouth baseball.\nThe Irish cadet team (13–18) played in a Dutch tournament held in Alphen aan den Rijn Netherlands. The Irish team came home with a bronze medal, with Amsterdam Pirates receiving the runners-up prize."

        "text": "Michael “the Burner” Turner (born February 13, 1982) is an American former football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Northern Illinois Huskies, earning second-team All-American honors in 2003. He was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the fifth round of the 2004 NFL Draft, and also played in the NFL for the Atlanta Falcons. He was a two-time All-Pro and a two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Falcons.\nEarly years.\nTurner attended North Chicago Community High School in North Chicago, Illinois. In 1999, he led his team to a 6–4 mark and the first playoff bid in 8 years by rushing for 1,392 yards and 14 touchdowns (10.5 average). His biggest game was for 295 yards on 19 carries including touchdown runs of 67 and school-record 90 yards in a win over Zion-Benton. He was named the Offensive Player of the Year and was a unanimous first-team All-North Suburban Conference player. He finished his high school career with 2,732 rushing yards and 26 total touchdowns. Turner also lettered in track &amp; field at North Chicago, where he was a sectional 100-meter dash champion with a time of 11.15 seconds.\nCollege career.\nHe attended Northern Illinois University, and played for the Northern Illinois Huskies football team. As a junior, he finished second in the nation with 1,915 yards, including five 200+ yd games and two games with five touchdowns. In 2003, he finished second in the NCAA in rushing, behind his future NFL teammate Darren Sproles, with 1,648 yards. He left NIU with the school records for rushing yards (4,941), touchdowns (43) and all-purpose yards (5,392). Since his departure from NIU, two records (rushing yards and touchdowns) have been broken by Garrett Wolfe.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nTurner was selected by the Chargers in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. As a rookie, Turner played mostly on special teams, but started and ran for 87 yards in the regular-season finale against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nTurner had again spent most of 2005 on the bench as backup to Pro Bowl starter LaDainian Tomlinson. But in the December 18 game against the undefeated Indianapolis Colts, Turner came off the bench to run for 113 yards, including a game-clinching 83-yard touchdown.\nDuring the 2007 off season, Chargers' General Manager A. J. Smith stated that the Chargers would be willing to trade Turner in exchange for both a first and third round draft pick. However, a day after 2007 NFL Draft concluded, A. J. Smith stated that Michael Turner would remain a Charger for the 2007 season. He would no longer be accepting trade offers from other NFL teams for Turner.\nOn April 26, 2007, Turner signed the $2.35 million, one-year tender he received from the Chargers after becoming a restricted free agent.\nOn January 13, 2008, Turner gained attention when he filled in ably for the Chargers' injured starter Tomlinson early in an AFC Divisional playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts, gaining 71 yards on 17 carries, including several key runs.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn March 2, 2008, the Atlanta Falcons signed Turner to a six-year, $34.5 million contract with $15 million guaranteed. He was represented by agent James \"Bus\" Cook.\nIn his Falcon debut, Turner broke the Falcons' single game rushing record against the Detroit Lions on September 7, 2008, rushing for 220 yards on 22 carries with 2 touchdowns. His 220 yards against the Lions marked the third-highest opening day rushing total behind O. J. Simpson’s 250 yards in 1973 and Arian Foster's 231 yards in 2010 and his rushing total is also the most in NFL annals by a player in his first game with a new team and surpassed the previous mark of 202 yards setting by running back Gerald Riggs on September 2, 1984. Coincidentally, Turner became the first Falcons offensive player of the week following an NFL season opening weekend since Riggs earned the honor after setting his record in 1984. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the week for this performance. On November 23, 2008, he set a personal record with 4 rushing TDs in a victory over the Carolina Panthers. He compiled 117 yards rushing during that same game. His seventeen rushing touchdowns during the 2008 season broke the Atlanta Falcons' single season record of 14 set by Jamal Anderson in 1998, it is also the second-most in NFL history for a first season with a team behind only Eric Dickerson (18). He finished the year with 1,699 yards (a 4.5 ypc avg) and 17 rushing touchdowns. He is the first Atlanta Falcon in history to start and finish a season with 200 yard rushing performances (220 against Detroit week 1 and 208 against St. Louis week 17).\nOn December 16, 2008, Turner was named to the 2009 Pro Bowl, along with fellow Falcon WR Roddy White.\nTurner and teammates Roddy White, Eric Weems, Ovie Mughelli, Brent Grimes, Tony Gonzalez, John Abraham, Tyson Clabo, and Matt Ryan were voted to the 2011 Pro Bowl.\nOn January 1, 2012, Turner broke Gerald Riggs's franchise rushing touchdown record against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Turner rushed for 2 touchdowns, bringing his total rushing touchdowns as a Falcon to 60.\nOn March 1, 2013, Turner was released by the Falcons after failing a physical, saving the team $6.9 million in salary-cap space.\nAfter his release from the Falcons, Turner did not sign with another NFL team."

        "title": "Tin Can (basketball arena)",
        "text": "The Indoor Athletic Court (commonly known as the Tin Can or the Indoor Athletic Center) was the home of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team from January 8, 1924, through February 17, 1938, across fifteen seasons. Due to increased demand for viewing the varsity basketball team and limited capacity at then home court Bynum Gymnasium, the university appropriated $54,482.45 to have a structure built to house the team. Then Graduate Manager of Athletics Charles T. Woollen decided to build a temporary structure with those funds and a more permanent venue later. Plans were purchased and work began in October 1923. The building, which was a completely steel structure, was built with galvanized steel sheet siding and roof. Many felt the building did not have an attractive exterior. The building featured one bathroom, no locker or dressing rooms, and no heating system, initially. Quickly the building earned a reputation for being cold during the winter and hot during the summer time. An official heating system and, later individual heaters, were added to the building, but did not help the temperature problem. The men's basketball team moved to the Woollen Gymnasium in 1939.\nDuring their time in the Tin Can, the Tar Heels won several Southern Conference championships: six regular season titles and four conference tournament titles. Aside from basketball the building was used for many other sports including: wrestling, fencing, and boxing, among others. It hosted the Southern Indoor Track and Field Games for the Southern Conference for nine years. Outside of athletics, the Tin Can was the site of many class picnics, school dances, class registration, and concerts. In the 1930s and 1940s, the building hosted several big bands and artists including Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey. Following the basketball team's departure, students continued to use the facility for sports, while adjustments were made to allow for volleyball and golf. After World War II, the building was used as a temporary dormitory for around 275 students. When a structure was announced to be built in the Tin Can's location in 1976, the university's trustees weighed the costs of moving the existing structure to the east end of Fetzer Field or tearing down the Tin Can and building a replica in the aforementioned location. Ultimately, the structure was torn down and a new one built on Fetzer Field. In total, the university used the temporary building for 54 years.\nConstruction and architecture.\nThe growth of the University of North Carolina in the preceding years strove the efforts to build a new facility so that more of the student body would be able to view games. It was reported that if one desired to go to a game at the then home venue Bynum Gymnasium the season before, one would have to get there an hour early to guarantee a spot. The total cost for the venue was constructed for $54,482.25. In April 1923, North Carolina's Board of Trustees allocated $40,000 for a physical training building. Graduate Manager of Athletics Charles T. Woollen decided to build a temporary venue rather than another small facility, while planning to build another larger and central gymnasium later (what became Woollen Gymnasium). In early October 1923, Woollen announced that work was to begin on a new field for athletics between dormitories, as well as an indoor athletic field. The indoor facility would feature eight smaller basketball courts and the school's varsity team would play on one full length court, with stands being provided for fans.\nThe building for indoor athletic field was purchased from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Blard-Knox Company. On October 26, \"The Tar Heel\" reported that construction began on the new indoor facility by raising steel erectors. This steel construction was to be finished within three weeks and only one more week was needed to place the floors, before the building was to be finished. The floor was maplewood and the rest of the structure was made of steel, with the roof and siding being galvanized sheet iron. The venue was 300 feet by 110 feet and included one toilet. In addition to basketball courts, it held a one-sixth mile track. Aside from hosting varsity basketball contests, intramural sports were planned to use the facility. It was the first building on campus to be strictly for an athletic purpose. Before being built, it was hoped to allow roughly 4,000 spectators in the building when using three of the courts to host tournaments. However, the portable bleachers that were used only allowed roughly 2,500 fans. As a whole, it was thought to be visually unappealing, and one \"Daily Tar Heel\" article written after its removal, stated that most people considered the structure to be an \"eyesore.\"\nThe structure was never given a formal name aside from Indoor Athletic Center or the Indoor Athletic Court, but the students eventually referred to it as the Tin Can and the name stuck. It was located between what is now Morehead-Patterson Bell Tower and Woollen Gymnasium along South Road, on the site of what is now Fetzer Hall. The Bell Tower's chimes would make the Tin Can's roof reverberate. There was no air conditioning, heating, or insulation in the Tin Can, which left it freezing in the winter and \"like an oven\" in the summer. Dripping water would often leak down the walls and form icicles. By 1927, players wore sweatshirts and gloves while warming up due to the cold conditions in the venue and its lack of heating, and later, effective heating. In 1929, it was announced that there would be a renovation to add a heating system. In addition, there will be a place created for a stage to be placed for concerts. Despite the installation of a heating system, players and coaches still complained about the temperature. Near the end of December 1940, the Tin Can was announced to be receiving a $4,000 paint job on the exterior. Backboards that were used by the students were replaced, along with the addition of signs and partitions placed at the entrance. One writer expressed that the floors were \"spic and span\" after not having been cleaned in a long time.\nSince there were no showers in the building, athletes and students would have to head to their dormitories or Emerson Field to shower. Due to continued heating issues, small electric heaters that featured blowers were used, but this proved ineffective. Heaters would be placed near the benches during games, while the crowd had no heaters in their area. There were four heaters that the Tin Can had in 1940.\nHistory.\nThe first game in the Tin Can was played on January 8, 1924, when Carolina squared off against Mercer University. Two thousand people turned up for the game. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote following the game: \"Two thousand spectators, well-wrapped in overcoats, shivered away in the spacious and airy and saw the 'Tin Can' christened with a victory.\" After several of the first home games that season, \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that the venue should be called \"the Refrigerator\" instead of the Tin Can. The Tar Heels concluded the 1923–24 campaign and season in the Tin Can undefeated. The team was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nAs success continued into Southern Conference play in the 1930s, the capacity of the Tin Can proved insufficient to meet the increased interest in the team. North Carolina played the last of their games there at the end of the 1938 season, having officially moved to the adjacent Woollen Gymnasium on January 4, 1939. The last game that was played was against Washington &amp; Lee on February 17, 1938, where 4,000 fans attended as Carolina beat the visitors 42–39. The Tar Heels won Southern Conference regular season titles in 1922, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1935, and 1936, along with conference titles in 1924, 1925, 1926, and 1935.\nHome–court advantage.\nThe Carolina teams played 15 seasons in the arena. Across those seasons, the Tar Heels played 150 games, where they amassed 130 wins against 20 losses, for a win percentage of 86.7%. In four of the fifteen seasons, the team went undefeated in all contests at the Tin Can: 1923–24 (10–0), 1925–26 (10–0), 1927–28 (10–0), and 1934–35 (9–0). Their worst home record in the venue was in the 1929–30 season, when the Tar Heels went 7–5.\nOther uses.\nThe Indoor Athletic Center was used for a myriad of other sports including: wrestling, fencing, boxing, indoor track, and badminton. Collegiate boxing drew crowds close to 2,500 for fights that featured North Carolina born boxers Marion Diehl and Gates Kimball. The building hosted the Southern Conference's annual Southern Indoor Track and Field Games for a total of nine years, where the Tar Heels won seven of those nine meets. The dance committee would also often use it to host dances. Physical education classes made use of the venue in the years after the team's departure specifically for volleyball and track skills. In addition, the Freshman basketball team got to practice in the venue at an earlier time, after having to practice at night when they shared it with the varsity. In the 1930s and early 1940s, the Tin Can was a \"mecca\" for listening to big bands. A Charlotte businessman Charlie Wood sponsored a campus band between 1937 and 1940 that used the facility and during that time several artists like Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, and Eddie Duchin, among others, played in the Tin Can. Class registration was held in the Tin Can on several occasions.\nAfter the men's basketball team departed.\nNo longer needed for major athletic events, the Tin Can was used for a variety of purposes during the remainder of its life. The gym served as an annex for Woollen Gymnasium. In 1940, there were rumors that the Tin Can would be renovated on the interior and a form of insulation would be added, allowing it to remain a permanent part of campus. Specifically, it was hoped to insulate the walls with red brick. While concurrently operational with Woollen, \"The Daily Tar Heel\" in 1940 stated that roughly 500 students and athletes would make use of the facility. After the basketball team left, volleyball courts and a golf driving cage were added. It also contained a fencing strip and platform, along with the indoor track and its regulation basketball court still. Pick-up basketball was a common use for the court. Each year there would be class picnics or barbeques that would be held in the Tin Can before it closed. In 1965, while Carmichael Auditorium (the new home for varsity men's basketball) was delayed in finishing due to various reasons, one of which was a broken water pipe, the men's varsity team practiced in the Tin Can.\nImmediately after World War II, the arena housed returning veterans when the university ran out of space in dormitories. The school placed nearly 100 bunk beds in the building, along with around 50 dressers for over 200 students. Those that stayed in the structure were known as \"tin canners\" and would bathe and use the restrooms in Woollen Gymnasium. The students stayed there for several weeks.\nOn April 12, 1976, the university's trustees approved the building plans for a new facility on the site of the Tin Can. It was also revealed they were debating on what to do with the Tin Can: either move it to the east end of Fetzer Field or build a new facility like the Tin Can in that same location. Prior to deciding on the future of the venue, the trustees wanted to see the cost estimates for moving the Tin Can. The structure was finally demolished in 1977 to allow the construction of the present day Fetzer Hall. The venue was removed with a bulldozer in early June. It was stipulated that 25 sheets of the siding be saved in the deconstruction for the alumni department, who would sell them to former students as sentimental pieces. The Tin Can was used for 54 years after being envisioned as a temporary building. Don Bolden of \"The Daily Times–News\" felt the Tin Can was a landmark.\nIt was decided that a structure similar to the Tin Can was to be built near Fetzer Field by November 1977. That new structure would be of similar dimensions and serve the same purpose. Then Physical Education Department chairman Carl S. Blyth stated the cost for that new building would be between $400,000 and $450,000. No parts of the original Tin Can were to be used in the new building's construction. Blyth stated moving the original Tin Can was considered, but ultimately rejected. The $5.9 million building to be placed on top of where the Tin Can laid was hoped to completed by November 1979 and featured 157,000 square feet that would be used for handball, squash, and three large gymnasiums, among other uses."

        "title": "Indianapolis 500 by year",
        "text": "This article discusses the year-by-year history of the Indianapolis 500 race.\nYears.\n1909–1910.\nThe first motorcycle and automobile races and demonstration runs are held the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August 1909. After a series of accidents, the original surface of crushed stone and tar is deemed unsuitable for racing. In the fall of 1909, the entire track is paved in brick, immediately giving the track the nickname \"The Brickyard.\" An exhibition meet is held in December 1909, and racing meets are held throughout the summer of 1910.\n1911–1919.\n1911: A historic event in the history of American automobile racing. After two years hosting multiple race meets, the Speedway management decided from 1911 onward to conduct one major racing event per year. With the then-fantastic marathon distance of 500 miles, and a substantial purse, 40 cars qualify. Ray Harroun, an engineer for the Marmon Co. receives the checkered flag at an average speed of just over 74 mph. The inaugural \"International 500-Mile Sweepstakes\" is a rousing success, and becomes an annual Memorial Day tradition, and eventually grows to become one of the most important automobile races in the world.\n1912: Ralph DePalma's Mercedes breaks its connecting rod after leading 196 laps. Joe Dawson, in a National, wins after leading the only 2 laps of his Indy career. No driver has ever matched DePalma's 196 fruitless laps in the lead, (only not being in the lead for the first two and the last two laps) and only Billy Arnold's 198 lap domination of the 1930 race tops DePalma's time at the front; Dawson's 2 laps led by a winner would be the fewest recorded by a winner until 2011.\n1913: A five-story, wooden pagoda-style timing and scoring tower on the inside of the main straightaway gives the Speedway an enduring landmark; the style reflects Speedway President Carl Fisher's apparent interest in Oriental architecture. French born Jules Goux drinks six bottles of champagne on his way to a record 13-minute, 8-second victory over second place Spencer Wishart. He averages approximately 10 miles per gallon of fuel – and an unknown quantity of champagne per stop. Goux's victory is the first race, excluding the first, won by a rookie driver.\n1914: France takes its second consecutive 500 victory, this time with René Thomas, the first occasion for consecutive rookie winners. Also, in a technological breakthrough, inaugural race winner Ray Harroun, in charge of the United States Motor Company team, develops a fuel-sipping carburetor that runs on kerosene. Driver Willie Carlson's Maxwell chassis proceeds to run the race to an eventual ninth-place finish on a mere 30 gallons; with the price at $0.06 a gallon, Carlson's total $1.80 fuel bill stands as the most economical performance in motor racing history.\n1915: Ralph DePalma's Mercedes again begins to slow with connecting rod problems late in the race. This time though he makes it to the finish to win.\n1916: Dario Resta wins the race, which was shortened to 300 miles (500 km) due to the ongoing war in Europe. The field of 21 cars is the smallest ever. Later in the year, the Harvest Auto Racing Classic is also held.\n1917–1918: Race is not held on account of World War I. Other tracks continue to host smaller events, but Indianapolis voluntarily suspends the race. Though closed to racing, the Speedway is used as an airstrip, serving as a fuel stop between Air Force bases in Dayton, Ohio and Rantoul, Illinois.\n1919: With the track reopened after the war, local Indiana-born driver Howdy Wilcox wins the race. There are 19 rookies who start this year's race, the most newcomers in one Indy 500 field (if one discounts the \"all-rookie\" field of 1911).\n1920–1929.\n1920: Ralph DePalma suffers another heartbreaking mishap when his magneto fails with 14 laps to go while leading. Gaston Chevrolet takes over the lead and goes on to win. Six months later, Chevrolet is fatally injured in a race at Beverly Hills. He becomes the first '500' winner to die.\n1921: Tommy Milton, Gaston Chevrolet's replacement on the Frontenac team, drives through the field from 20th starting position to win his first '500'. Ralph DePalma again dominates the first half of the race, only to suffer mechanical failure. DePalma's career record total of 612 laps led will stand for the next 66 years.\n1922: Jimmy Murphy is the first driver to win the race from the pole position.\n1923: Despite suffering loss of circulation and blistering in his hands due to shrinkage of his tight-fitting, 'White Kid' gloves, Tommy Milton becomes the first driver to win the race twice (Milton was relieved by Howdy Wilcox for laps 103–151).\n1924: Lora L. Corum's car is taken over by Joe Boyer, who goes on to win. Corum wins without leading a single lap in his racing career at Indianapolis, the first driver to do so.\n1925: The race is won by Ralph DePalma's nephew, and former riding mechanic, Peter DePaolo. Depaolo was the first to average over on his way to victory. The race was part of the 1925 World Manufacturers' Championship.\n1926: Twenty-three-year-old racing sensation Frank Lockhart wins the race as a rookie. He is the first winner born in the 20th century. Rain hampered the race, and it was called at the 400-mile mark. The race was part of the 1926 World Manufacturers' Championship.\n1927: Rookie George Souders wins by eight laps, the largest margin since 1913; consecutive rookie winners occurs for the second time. Many racing pundits view Souders' race as the most surprising, 'longest-shot' 500-Mile Race win in history until 1987. Souders becomes the first driver to win the full-500-mile race solo, with neither any relief help, nor a riding mechanic. The race was part of the 1927 World Manufacturers' Championship.\n1928: Jimmy Gleason has a good lead when he stops for water for the radiator on lap 195. A crew member misses the radiator and douses the car's magneto. Gleason is out and Louis Meyer wins. The race was part of the 1928 World Manufacturers' Championship.\n1929: Louis Meyer stalls on his final pitstop, handing the race to Ray Keech, who is killed in a racing crash just two weeks after the '500'.\n1930–1939.\n1930: Billy Arnold takes the lead on lap three and is never challenged again. Arnold's 198 laps led in a race has never been bettered.\n1931: 1930 winner Billy Arnold is 5 laps ahead on lap 162 when his rear axle breaks and Arnold crashes. His wheel flies over a fence and hits and kills 12-year-old Wilbur C. Brink, who is sitting in his garden on Georgetown Road. Arnold and his mechanic are injured. Louis Schneider leads the remaining laps.\n1932: Fred Frame wins the race from 27th starting position, and is the eighth different leader of the race, a record at the time.\n1933: The largest field to date with 42 starters. Louis Meyer wins after one of the most violent races ever, with five drivers or mechanics killed and several others seriously injured. The standard Victory Banquet after the race is not held, and the predominance of safety as chief concern for race organizers begins 'in force'. Prior to the 1933 race, Howdy Wilcox II (no relation to the 1919 winner) was disqualified when officials found out that he was a diabetic.\n1934: Bill Cummings wins by 27 seconds from Mauri Rose, the closest ever finish at the time.\n1935: The newly introduced yellow 'caution' light, requiring drivers to slow and hold position, makes its first appearance in race, to eventual race winner Kelly Petillo's advantage as many of the late laps are disrupted by rain, neutralising Petillo's race long battle with Rex Mays and Wilbur Shaw.\n1936: Louis Meyer becomes the first driver to win a third time, drink milk (in actuality buttermilk) in Victory Lane, receive the Borg-Warner Trophy, and also receive the pace car as one of his prizes.\n1937: Wilbur Shaw leads most of the way but must slow late on to conserve engine oil. Ralph Hepburn catches Shaw in turn 4 on the final lap, but Shaw steps on the gas and pulls away to win by 2.16 seconds – the closest finish at that time.\n1938: Floyd Roberts, driving the ill-fated Burd Piston Ring Special, dominates to win by three laps.\n1939: Defending winner Floyd Roberts, driving the same car he drove into victory circle in 1938, dies in a crash coming off the second turn onto the backstretch on lap 107. Wilbur Shaw wins his second 500, driving a Maserati. Interesting fact: The Maserati used by Wilbur Shaw was also used by Bill Vukovich to accomplish his rookie test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. George Bailey became the first driver to compete with a rear-engined car in the Indianapolis 500 when he contested the 1939 race in a Gulf-Miller.\n1940–1949.\n1940: Wilbur Shaw becomes the second three-time winner and the first to win two in a row in the same Maserati he drove to victory the previous year. The last quarter of the distance is run under the caution flag due to rain.\n1941: A fire on race morning destroys part of the garage area and one of the qualified cars. The start is delayed by one hour because of the fire. Wilbur Shaw dominates again, but on lap 152, a wheel collapses, sending Shaw's car into the first turn wall. The wheel is believed to have been one Shaw identified before the race as faulty, and had marked it as not to be used. Water from the hoses battling the garage fire apparently washed off the markings and the wheel was put on during the last pit stop. Mauri Rose, whose pole-winning Maserati dropped out early, took over teammate Floyd Davis's car on lap 72 and drove up through the pack to win. This was the second and last time to date that there were co-winners.\n1942–1945: The Speedway is shut down for the duration of World War II—almost. Sometime in late autumn of 1944, Wilbur Shaw participates in a special tire test for Firestone at the track. He is dismayed by the condition of the facility, and, after talking to track owner Eddie Rickenbacker, sets out single-handedly to find a buyer to rejuvenate the speedway. On November 14, 1945, Tony Hulman purchases the track and begins a six-month crash renovation program to revive the 500-mile race in 1946.\n1946: The first post-war '500' is a box-office smash, with massive traffic jams of spectators still entering the gates long after the race starts. Most of the race cars show the effects of sitting unused for almost five years, and mechanical attrition is extremely heavy. George Robson, driving a nine-year-old \"Thorne Engineering Special\" Sparks, survives the attrition to win by 44 seconds over rookie Jimmy Jackson.\n1947: Mauri Rose and rookie teammate Bill Holland dominate the race in their twin \"Blue Crown Spark Plug Special\"s. Holland, who is well ahead in the late stages, obeys a pit signal to slow down and preserve the car for the finish. Rose gets the same signal, but continues to charge ahead and overtakes Holland with seven laps to go. Rose goes on to win, to the dismay of Holland, who thought he had been a lap ahead. A pre-race dispute between track management and a drivers association results in only 30 cars lining up on race day, instead of the usual 33.\n1948: Rose and Holland repeat their one-two performance of the previous year, this time without the controversy. Ted Horn finishes fourth in Wilbur Shaw's old Maserati, completing a run of nine consecutive races in which he is fourth or better, although he never wins.\n1949: After pole-sitter Duke Nalon crashes out spectacularly in the Novi, the race settles down to a repeat of 1947, only this time Bill Holland won't be caught napping. Mauri Rose tries to catch him anyway, but a broken magneto strap takes him out of second place with eight laps remaining. Holland cruises home the winner. It's the last victory for a front-wheel drive car at Indianapolis.\n1950–1959.\n1950: The Indianapolis 500 was part of the Formula 1 World Championship calendar from 1950–1960. A rumor circulated at race morning, that Johnnie Parsons' engine had an irreparable crack. During the race, his hard charging performance sees him leading, and picking up lap leader prizes. At 345 miles (555 km) the rain comes, and Parsons is declared the winner as the race is called at lap 138. Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck film scenes from the movie \"To Please a Lady\" during the race.\n1951: Four days after winning the 500 (and becoming the first to do so in less than four hours) Lee Wallard is severely burned in a sprint car race and lives the rest of his life unable to perspire properly and without the strength to drive a car.\n1952: Bill Vukovich leads 150 laps until his steering pin breaks on lap 192. He stopped the car by brushing it against the outside wall, a move which prevented other cars from becoming involved in the sudden incident. Twenty-two-year-old Troy Ruttman takes the checkered flag, the youngest-ever winner. On the pole for the '52 race was Fred Agabashian's Diesel-powered racer that succumbed to supercharger trouble on lap 71.\n1953: On one of the hottest days on record for the running of the 500, Bill Vukovich leads 195 laps and cruises to a win by nearly three laps over 1952 rookie of the year Art Cross. Vukovich wins without relief help in a race that sees one entry being driven by as many as five separate drivers, and suffers the death of driver Carl Scarborough due to heat prostration.\n1954: Picking up where he left off, Bill Vukovich wins again by one lap over Jimmy Bryan, after taking the lead for the final time just past the halfway point. Incredibly, for the second straight year one entry on race day is driven by five separate drivers, in temperatures only just below the previous year's record.\n1955: After two wins and 485 laps led of a possible 656 (74%), Bill Vukovich is killed on lap 57 after crashing out of the lead. Rodger Ward broke a rear axle and a back marker tangled with him in front of Vukovich, whose car hits them and vaults over the backstretch wall into a car park.\nBob Sweikert wins after Art Cross blows his engine on lap 169 and Don Freeland loses drive on lap 179. Sweikert dies in a sprint car race a year later. Interesting fact: Sweikert built the Offenhauser engine that brought him the victory, while his car owner (AJ Watson) was at his wife's bedside while she was in labor.\n1956: AAA drops out of sanctioning racing after the 1955 Vukovich crash and public outcry that briefly followed, and the tragedy at Le Mans that same year, so USAC is formed to sanction Indianapolis style racing. Torrential rains flood the facility the week of the race and threaten to postpone, or outright cancel the race. Track superintendent Clarence Cagle pulls off what becomes known as \"Cagle's miracle\" and has the track cleaned up in time for race morning. Pat Flaherty wins.\n1957: After thirteen years of trying, Sam Hanks finally wins the 500, and then, amidst tears, becomes the second winner, after Ray Harroun in 1911, to announce his retirement in victory lane. Hanks' win comes in a radical \"lay-down\" roadster chassis design created by engineer George Salih that, with the engine tilting 72-degrees to the right, gives the car a profile of a mere off the ground. Salih builds the car next to his California home, and is rewarded with victory as both designer and owner after stepping out on a financial limb in entering the car himself.\n1958: A huge wreck in turn three on the opening lap wipes out several cars, and driver Pat O'Connor is fatally injured. Jimmy Bryan goes on to win in the same car Sam Hanks drove to victory the previous year. Little-known rookie A. J. Foyt spins out and finishes 16th.\n1959: A record sixteen cars finish the entire as Rodger Ward holds off Jim Rathmann for the win.\n1960–1969.\n1960: Jim Rathmann and Rodger Ward resume their duel from last year, trading the lead fourteen times in the last 200 miles. After three-second-place finishes, Rathmann finally prevails when Ward has to slow down to save his tires with three laps to go. There are 29 lead changes in all, a record that will stand for over 50 years. Rookie Jim Hurtubise shatters the track record in qualifying at over 149 miles per hour, coming within 16/100ths of a second of turning the first 150 mph lap at the Speedway.\n1961: The Golden Anniversary of the first '500' starts with 82-year-old Ray Harroun taking a parade lap in his winning Marmon Wasp of 1911. After several different drivers, including newcomer Parnelli Jones, take turns leading, the race comes down a battle between A. J. Foyt and Eddie Sachs, which goes to Foyt when Sachs pits for a right rear tire with only three laps to go. Formula 1 champion Jack Brabham finishes ninth in a rear-engine Cooper-Climax, a prelude of things to come.\n1962: Parnelli Jones breaks the 150 mph barrier to win the pole, and dominates the first 300 miles on race day. However, his brakes fail and he has to slow down. Rodger Ward takes over the lead and wins his second '500' by 11 seconds over teammate Len Sutton.\n1963: Parnelli Jones finishes the job he started last year, leading 167 of the 200 laps to win in his front-engine roadster \"Old Calhoun\", in spite of a late-race oil leak which almost gets him the black flag. Formula 1 champion-to-be Jim Clark comes in second in a rear-engine Lotus-Ford, heralding the British Invasion of the 500 and Indy-car racing in general.\n1964: Rear-engine, Ford-powered cars sweep the front row, with Jim Clark raising the track record by over seven miles an hour. Tragedy strikes on Lap 2 when Dave MacDonald hits the wall coming out of Turn 4 and his car explodes in a huge fireball. Eddie Sachs and several others pile into the accident, which stops the race for nearly two hours. Both MacDonald and Sachs are killed. When the race resumes, the fast but fragile rear-engine cars fall apart, leaving A. J. Foyt to pick up the pieces, as he becomes a two-time winner. Foyt's roadster is the last front-engine machine to win the Indianapolis 500.\n1965: Scotland's Jim Clark leads 190 of 200 laps to become the first non-American winner since 1916. His Lotus-Ford is the first rear-engine winning car, and the first to average more than 150 miles per hour for the entire distance (150.686), just three years after the first \"single lap\" was turned at 150. Parnelli Jones finishes second and rookie Mario Andretti is third.\n1966: A huge pile-up at the start takes out 11 cars, including those of A. J. Foyt and Dan Gurney, but, thankfully, there are no serious injuries. Only seven cars are left running in the end, with Graham Hill edging out Jim Clark by 41 seconds in a Battle of Britains. Some people think there was a scoring error and that Clark had actually won, but Clark's team does not protest.\n1967: Andy Granatelli and his brothers bring a radical new turbine-powered car to the Speedway this year. Parnelli Jones absolutely dominates the field in it, and leads by almost a lap when a bearing in the gearbox fails with just three and a half laps to go. A. J. Foyt weaves his way through a multi-car accident on the final straightaway to win his third '500'. The race is a two-day affair for the first time when rain postpones the event after only 18 laps on May 30. Shortly after the race, USAC officials change the rules regarding turbines to reduce the Granatellis' advantage.\n1968: The Granatellis return with even more turbines this year, in new wedge-shaped Lotus chassis. They take the first two starting spots with record speeds of over 170 mph. However, on race day, Bobby Unser in a turbocharged Offenhauser-powered car, is able to take their measure, leading 127 laps. Unser's path to victory is cleared when Joe Leonard's turbine breaks its fuel pump shaft with just nine laps to go while leading. USAC then issues further restrictions on turbines, rendering any future such engines uncompetitive.\n1969: Andy Granatelli abandons the turbines and joins forces with Mario Andretti in a new four-wheel drive Lotus with a turbocharged Ford engine. But after the car is destroyed in a practice crash, the team qualifies a conventional two-wheel drive Hawk built by crew chief Clint Brawner. For the only time in Andretti's Indy career, all the breaks finally go his way, as he wins by nearly two laps over Dan Gurney. The long-suffering Granatelli plants a kiss on Mario's cheek in Victory Lane.\n1970–1979.\n1970 · 1971 · 1972 · 1973 · 1974 · 1975 · 1976 · 1977 · 1978 · 1979\n1980–1989.\n1980 · 1981 · 1982 · 1983 · 1984 · 1985 · 1986 · 1987 · 1988 · 1989\n1990–1999.\n1990 · 1991 · 1992 · 1993 · 1994 · 1995 · 1996 · 1997 · 1998 · 1999\n2000–2009.\n2000 · 2001 · 2002 · 2003 · 2004 · 2005 · 2006 · 2007 · 2008 · 2009\n2010–2019.\n2010 · 2011 · 2012 · 2013 · 2014 · 2015 · 2016 · 2017 · 2018 · 2019\n2020–2029.\n2020 · 2021 · 2022 · 2023 · 2024\nEras.\nDuring the over-century long history of the Indianapolis 500 and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, numerous recognized eras have been established by historians, media, competitors, and fans. As the race follows the infancy of the automobile through the 20th century, and into the 21st century, sharp increases in technology, car design, and speed, have generally shaped the eras, which loosely follow decade patterns. Organizational changes and disputes, varying levels of popularity, increased media coverage, world wars, personalities, participants, traditions, famous races, and tragedies, have all been defining factors to establish the boundaries of the respective eras.\nFisher Era.\nFrom the opening of the track (1909) and the first 500 (1911), through 1927. Carl G. Fisher and partners envisioned a \"proving ground\" for the budding automobile industry. The very early years of the 500 saw the track in its original \"proving ground\" intent, but the competition soon became the primary focus. Numerous makes and models of local, national, and international car companies participated, with the cars more conforming to the original specifications of being essentially stripped-down passenger vehicles. Riding mechanics were the norm (with the noteworthy exception of Ray Harroun in 1911).\nThe AAA Contest Board sanctioned the events at the Speedway, and the race ultimately became part of a National Championship of drivers. The discipline of Championship Car racing became a national sport, with the Indianapolis 500 as its marquee event. A maximum 33-car field was established, based on a 1919 mandate by AAA officials that of 400 feet of track per car.\nAfter World War I and during the Roaring Twenties, the formula quickly evolved into purpose-built racing machines. Small-block, supercharged 91 cu. in. (1.5 L) displacement engines were the standard. Riding mechanics were dropped, and the speeds quickly rose. Peter DePaolo became the first driver to average 100 mph for the 500 miles in 1925. Outside of Indianapolis, which was paved in brick, the 1920s was also the peak of popularity for board track racing. Fisher sold his interests in the track in late 1927.\nRickenbacker Era.\nFrom 1928–1941. Eddie Rickenbacker purchased the Speedway in late-1927, and ushered in a new era. Sweeping changes were abound, as Rickenbacker was interested in bringing the Speedway back to its original \"proving grounds\" intent. Numerous rules changes were put into place, in an effort to lure back the passenger car manufacturers, and move away from the small-block, specialized/purpose-built racing machines that had taken over the sport in the 1920s. Such things as the reinstatement of riding mechanics, time trials expanded to ten-lap runs (up from four laps), banning supercharging, and increased engine displacement would have the machines more closely resemble cars available to the motoring public. In additional larger fields were allowed for a time, to as many as 42 cars (up from the traditional 33).\nThe Rickenbacker era coincided with the Great Depression, although the Speedway did not experience significant financial peril. Contrary to popular belief, the aforementioned rule changes were not made in response to the stock market crash of 1929, they were in fact being laid out as early as 1928, and were already approved by the AAA Contest Board in early January 1929.\nSeveral Indy traditions were born during this time, including the first bottle of milk in victory lane, the first presentation of the Borg-Warner Trophy, and the tradition of presenting the race winner with the keys to the pace car. Rickenbacker also improved the facility with the addition of an 18-hole golf course. The Rickenbacker Era is considered the deadliest period of \"500\" history, with 24 fatalities amongst competitors and spectators. In response to the numerous fatal accidents, rule changes and track improvements slowly began to be implemented in the interest of safety.\nThe first major national radio coverage of the race occurred in 1928. By 1939, Mutual Broadcasting System was covering the race live to various affiliates across the country. The era ended with the onset of World War II (Pearl Harbor). Rickenbacker cancelled the 1942 race, shut the track down, and abandoned the facility during the war. It would soon fall into a state of neglect and disrepair.\nPost World War II era.\nFrom 1946-early 1950s. Immediately following World War II, the Speedway was sold to Tony Hulman. He swiftly renovated the track which had fallen into a state of disrepair during the war years. It is a brief period, marked by a mix of mostly older cars. Auto racing began to rebuild as a sport after being banned during World War II, primarily due to rationing.\nBy this time, the typical pre-war image of race car drivers as daredevils or reckless stunt drivers had faded. Likewise the mechanics' image as \"grease monkeys\" or low-level tradesmen faded, as the sophistication of engines and chassis increased. Numerous drivers and mechanics during this time had been involved in the war effort, either stateside or abroad. The legitimacy of the sport recognized on a national level began to grow.\nNational radio coverage of the race began to grow at a fast rate, first by Mutual, and later as a result of the formation of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network.\nRoadster Era.\nFrom 1952 to the mid-1960s. Considered by many as the \"golden era\" of the Indy 500, it is highlighted by the participation of the front-engined Roadsters. The first \"roadster\" is regarded to have been built and entered by Frank Kurtis in 1952.\nDuring this time (1950–1960), the Indy 500 awarded points towards the World Championship of Drivers. However, very few European entries even made an attempt to race at Indy.\nNoteworthy moments include the emotional victory by Sam Hanks in 1957, as well as the tragic death of two-time winner Bill Vukovich. The famous 1960 duel between Rodger Ward and Jim Rathmann set the race record for the most lead changes in Indy 500 history, a record that remarkably would not be broken until 2012. Indy legend A. J. Foyt debuted in 1958, and won his first 500 in 1961. In the fall of 1961, the last of the remaining original brick pavement was paved over in asphalt, and in 1962 Parnelli Jones famously broke the 150 mph barrier.\nRear-engine revolution.\nThe 1960s. Sometimes referred to as the \"British Invasion\" or the \"Decade of Innovation,\" it partly overlaps the aforementioned Roadster Era. In 1961, Jack Brabham arrived at Indy with a European, Grand Prix style, rear-engined machine. Against a field of venerable front-engined Offenhauser-powered roadsters, Brabham's car was considered diminutive and underpowered, however, it experienced exceptional handling in the relatively flat corners. The mechanical advantages of rear-engined cars were quickly realized, and rapidly began to displace their front-engined counterparts in the starting field. A. J. Foyt's win in 1964 was the last time a front-engine machine won the Indianapolis 500.\nIn 1965, ABC Sports carried the race for the first time on \"Wide World of Sports\", ushering in a new era of television coverage at Indy. Jim Clark won the race in a rear-engine machine, the first of its type to do so. By the end of the decade, the movement toward rear engine cars had over taken the sport. In 1969 not a single front-engined car would qualify.\nAfter a fiery fatal crash in 1964, USAC crafted rules to discourage, and eventually ban, the use of gasoline as a fuel.\nDecade of Legends.\nThe 1970s. After bolt-on wings started being allowed in 1972, speeds quickly climbed. Drivers went from laps in the 160 mph range a few years earlier, to flirting with the elusive and daunting 200 mph barrier. Turbocharged engines were the powerplants of choice, downforce levels increased substantially, and wide slick tires were now being used. It was both an entertaining spectacle for the fans, as well as a disaster waiting to happen, as safety features were not prepared for the rapid increase in speeds. After a tragic race in 1973, sweeping changes were made starting in 1974, both to the cars and the track itself. Tom Sneva broke the elusive 200 mph barrier in 1977.\nThis era is also associated with the establishment of numerous Indy \"legends.\" Drivers such as A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Johnny Rutherford, Gordon Johncock, and many others, reached the peak of their respective careers during this period. Future \"legends\" Tom Sneva and Rick Mears also began their careers during this decade. While the decade was dominated by American drivers and American-based teams, success was not exclusive to just U.S.-based entries. McLaren was among the European entrants that experienced success, and towards the end of the decade, the venerable Offenhauser engine was now being seriously challenged by the British-built Cosworth.\nA. J. Foyt became the first four-time winner of the 500, while Janet Guthrie became the first female to qualify for the race. The track itself gained notoriety for increasing attendance, television exposure, and the \"Snakepit,\" a gathering place in the infield known for revelry.\nCART era.\nFrom 1979 to 1995. After the formation of CART in 1979, the first open wheel \"Split\" came about and was the focus of the very early 1980s. After a few seasons of organizational disputes and various controversies, by 1983, a relative harmony in the sport settled, and saw the season of events sanctioned by CART, and the Indianapolis 500 itself sanctioned by USAC. The field of cars and drivers would be composed primarily of CART-based teams and various one-off (\"Indy only\") entries. The \"500\" would pay points towards the CART championship, though CART did not actually sanction the event.\nThe decade saw the concept of \"customer chassis\" take over the series, as well as exclusive engine leases creep into the competition. Nearly all engine and chassis manufacturers were foreign-based, to a point where by 1987, not a single chassis entered was built in the United States. Manufacturers such as March, Lola, and Reynard were the chassis of choice on the open market, with other more exclusive chassis (Penske and Galmer) also experiencing success.\nThis period also saw a sharp increase in the number of foreign-born competitors, going from as few as two, to as many as nineteen by 1995. While this was a booming period of increasing popularity both nationwide and worldwide, the dwindling number of American-born competitors was a point of contention for some fans and owners. In addition, the feeder series and \"ladder\" for arriving at Indy evolved from USAC sprints and midgets to predominantly formula-style road racing. Many of the top drivers on the circuit were now moving up from such disciplines as Can-Am, SCCA Super Vee, Atlantics, Indy Lights, and IMSA.\nRick Mears won the Indy 500 four times (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991) during the CART era, all for Penske Racing. The Penske team itself was one of the most successful teams during the era, winning nine races from 1979-1994. Al Unser Jr. became the first second-generation driver to win, while his father Al Unser Sr. won the race for the fourth time himself in 1987, in doing so, becoming the oldest driver to win. Speeds increased from just over 200 mph in the late 1970s, to over 230 mph by 1992. In 1986, Bobby Rahal became the first driver ever to complete the 500 miles in less than three hours, at an average speed of 170.722 mph.\nStarting in 1986, ABC Sports began carrying the race live on network television. In addition, the radio network swelled to over 1,200 affiliates nationwide.\nIRL / \"Split\" Era.\nFrom 1996–2007. The IRL was formed in 1996, starting what was considered a \"split\" in the sport of Indy car racing. Speedway president Tony George founded the series with stated goals of implementing cost saving measures and to increase American driver participation. CART-based teams boycotted the race for four years, considering the move a \"power grab\" by George, and citing several organizational disagreements.\nPopularity in the sport of Indy car racing and the Indy 500 saw a visible decline in attendance, television ratings, and positive media coverage. A new formula of normally-aspirated machines was introduced for 1997, and the \"original\" or \"Old School IRL\" era ran to roughly 2002. By 2003, most of the top CART-based teams and manufacturers had defected to the IRL, and likewise the landscape slowly receded back to resemble that of the CART era. Later, manufacturers began to pull out of the series, leaving Dallara and Honda as the only chassis and engine suppliers, respectively. A \"de facto\" \"spec car\" era began in 2006, but equipment shortages were not much of an issue going forward. Also in 2006, the series began experimenting with ethanol fuel blends.\nA major event off the track during this era was the implementation of the MSA, which effectively ended tobacco sponsorship in the sport.\nUnification Era.\nFrom 2008 through 2011. In 2008, the Indy Racing League and Champ Car completed an organizational unification, which marked the first time since 1978 that the sport of Indy car racing would be contested under a single sanctioning banner. The newly reorganized series would compete under the name IndyCar Series.\nThe seeds of unification and the end of the \"split\" began as early as 2000, when CART-based teams began crossing over to compete at Indy with the IRL regulars in one-off entries. The unified era can also be traced back more specifically to 2003, when most of the top CART-based teams and manufacturers defected to the IRL permanently and returned to Indy full-time.\nThe Unification Era spans specifically from either 2003 or 2008 through 2011. By the time of the formal 2008 unification, it was contested with the aforementioned \"spec car\", the Dallara IR03/05 powered by the normally aspirated Honda V-8 engines. With the sudden influx of former Champ Car teams and drivers, and an abundance of available rolling chassis, fields briefly grew. For a few years, bumping returned to time trials, and the era was highlighted by the 100th Anniversary of the Indianapolis 500 in 2011.\nThe end of the IR-03/05 \"spec\" era came at the conclusion of the 2011 IndyCar season. It ended, however, tragically at Las Vegas.\nSpec series Era.\nSince the 2012 IndyCar season, the series rolled out a new chassis and engine formula, bringing back turbocharged engines and multiple engine manufacturers. Honda, Chevrolet, and Lotus provided engines, though Lotus withdrew after only one season. The Dallara DW12 chassis was fitted with aero kits from Dallara from 2012-2014, then from Honda and Chevrolet respectively, from 2015-2017. A new universal Dallara aero kit has been used since 2018. Speeds began to climb again, surpassing the 230 mph barrier, but not breaking existing qualifying records that were set in 1996. The era was highlighted by the much-anticipated 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 in 2016.\nThe era has been marked with an increase in competition on the track, with an all-time record of 68 lead changes set in 2013, and a record 15 different leaders in 2017. The 2014 race saw a 149-lap caution free stint from the start, and the 2013 and 2014 races are the two fastest Indy 500 races in history. In 2013, Tony Kanaan averaged 187.433 mph, the fastest 500 in history."

The event currently carries a purse of $1,000,000. \nHistory.\nThe inaugural running of the event was on 2 March 1986, on the last day of a 71-day annual winter meeting as the Gulfstream Park Breeders Cup Handicap, the tenth race on the under-card of Florida Derby day. The event had additional sponsorship from the Breeders' Cup which gave the event immediate recognition and value. The event was won by Craig B. Singer's Irish-bred five-year-old Sondrio who started at odds of 7/1 and ran the miles distance in 1:40.60 winning by lengths. \nThe following year the event was held on the dirt track due to the condition of the turf track. The event had additional sponsorship from Budweiser and this reflected in the name of the race. Budweiser sponsorship continued for nine years ceasing after the 1995 running of the event.\nThe event was upgraded in 1990 by the American Graded Stakes Committee to a Grade III race. In 1991 the distance of the event was lengthened considerably to miles and the following year the event was upgraded to Grade II classification. In 1994 the event was transferred to the dirt track and held over a distance of miles.\nAfter the 2007 running of the event the Breeders' Cup ceased to sponsor the event and the event was known as the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap. In 2009 the distance of the event was decreased by two furlongs to miles.\nIn 2019 Gulfstream Park Administration created a racing series called the Pegasus World Cup and this event was rebranded as the Pegasus World Cup Turf Invitational. In the first edition, each entrant's connections had to pay a $500,000 entry fee with the organizer adding an extra $1,000,000 for a total purse of $7,000,000. In the 2020 edition, the race adopted the Invitational format and entry fees were suppressed, so the purse was limited to the organizer contribution.\nRecords.\nTime record: \nMargins:\nMost wins:\nMost wins by an owner:\nMost wins by a jockey:\nMost wins by a trainer:\nWinners.\nLegend:\n \nNotes:\n§ Ran as an entry\n† In the 2010 running of the event Take The Points was first past but was disqualified for interference in the straight and placed fifth and Court Vision was declared the winner."

He was selected in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL draft by the Steelers and played for the team for thirteen seasons. He played college football for the Northern Colorado Bears.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nSmith was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round, 109th pick overall, of the 1999 NFL draft.

After the 2008 season, Smith won another ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII.\nOn February 27, 2007, the Steelers resigned Smith to a 5-year, US$25 million contract. Through the 2007 season, Smith ranks ninth all-time on the Steelers sacks list. After missing parts of three games with a knee injury early in the 2007 season, Smith missed the last four games due to a torn biceps muscle while playing against the New England Patriots in early December.

Logan (born September 15, 1974) is former American professional American football player.\nHigh school.\nMike Logan attended high school at McKeesport Area High School in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He played football for the Tigers under famed WPIAL coach George Smith.\nCollege career.\nMike Logan was a four-year regular at cornerback and one of the most talented return men in WVU history from 1993 to 1996.\nPlaying for coach Don Nehlen, Logan was one of the best recruits out of Pennsylvania, but his career at West Virginia was limited by breaking the same arm three times. Logan appeared in 37 games, starting 22 during his career, recording 140 tackles, 18 passes broken up, two forced fumbles, eight interceptions and two fumble recoveries.\nLogan finished his career ranking seventh in school history with 18 passes broken up (now ranks 15th), fourth in single-season PBU with 11 (now ranks 13th) and sixth in career kick return yardage with 869 yards (now ranks 12th).\nAs a senior, Logan led the Big East in punt returns (12.4) and ranked second in interceptions (0.45) and PBU (11). He was named to the Football News all-conference team. Logan earned first-team All-Big East honors at cornerback and second-team all-conference recognition as a return specialist.\nLogan was a hero in the East Carolina win in 1996, coming through with a first-half interception and then stripping a pass from ECU's Larry Shannon at the WVU eight in the fourth quarter, returning that fumble 25 yards.\nAs a freshman, in 1993, Logan recovered a Boston College fumble at the WVU 37 yard-line with 2:23 remaining to set up WVU's final scoring drive and then intercepted a Glenn Foley pass in the end zone on the game's last play to preserve WVU's undefeated regular season and a 1994 Sugar Bowl appearance. Logan also played in the 1995 Carquest Bowl and 1997 Gator Bowl.\nLogan had a career-best nine tackles in the 21-0 win over Pitt in 1995, had two interceptions in the 13-0 win over Maryland in 1996 and returned a punt for a touchdown in the 30-10 win at Temple in 1996.\nHe received the Scott Shirley Award in 1993, presented to WVU's top special teams player, and received the Gridiron Gladiator Award in 1996, given for on-field intensity. He is a member of the 1990-99 WVU all-time football team.\nHis achievements as a Mountaineer and in the NFL earned him induction into the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in September 2014.\nProfessional career.\nAfter a college career at West Virginia University, Logan was a second-round draft pick for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1997. As a rookie, Logan only recorded 15 tackles, but improved his second season to 29 tackles. He recorded his first NFL interception in his final and best season in Jacksonville, 2000. Logan recorded 60 tackles that year, along with his first career sack and two interceptions.\nLogan then went to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2001 season, bringing him home to play for the team he grew up idolizing. Logan started out slowly his first two years in Pittsburgh, but by the 2003 season he had broken out. Logan had a career-high 94 tackles that year along with a sack. Unlike his previous two seasons of 2001 and 2002, Logan had no interceptions in 2003 (he had two INTs in 2001 and 1 INT in 2002). After being re-signed in 2004, Logan produced a career-worst 8 tackles for the season after suffering a season-ending injury and being placed on the injured reserve list. Logan was a part of the championship Super Bowl XL team for the Steelers beating the Seattle Seahawks and won his first Super Bowl ring. He retired from professional football in 2007.\nRadio.\nLogan has remained in the Pittsburgh area as a radio personality. He co-hosted the weekday afternoon show \"The Drive with Paulsen, Logan &amp; Mack\" on 1250 ESPN Radio with Scott Paulsen and Chris Mack until the station went off the air in September 2010."

The merger took place on 1 August 2020. CUBC now selects a lightweight men's Blue Boat from the men's squad to represent Cambridge at the Lightweight Boat Races.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1974 by Richard Bates and raced against Oxford in 1975. These races were the basis on which the Henley Boat Races were later founded. For more than twenty five years Robert Greatorex presided over the club. In recent years, the club fielded two crews each year, the lightweight Blue Boat and Granta, the lightweight reserve crew. The reserve boat, Granta, raced Oxford's equivalent, Nephthys, from 2000 until 2007 and restarted racing Oxford in a pairs race in recent years.\nFor a brief period in 1999 - 2002 there was an active old boys club \"Farmer\" whose finest race was beating the 1999 Nephthys crew by 2L.\nThe Blue Boat crew have the right to wear a distinctive uniform. As a half blue sport, they wear a unique Cambridge blue and white striped blazer with the club insignia on the chest pocket. This blazer design has been retained by the Blue Boat upon merger with CUBC. Blue Boat oarsmen who go on to win a round of the Temple Challenge Cup or Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in the same season as their Boat Race are awarded Discretionary Full Blues and are entitled to wear a Cambridge blue blazer with the club insignia on the chest pocket.

        "title": "United States Bowling Congress",
        "text": "The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) is a sports membership organization dedicated to ten-pin bowling in the United States. It was formed in 2005 by a merger of the American Bowling Congress—the original codifier of all tenpin bowling standards, rules and regulations from 1895 onwards; the Women's International Bowling Congress—founded in 1916, as the female bowlers' counterpart to the then all-male ABC; the Young American Bowling Alliance, and USA Bowling. The USBC's headquarters are located in Arlington, Texas, after having moved from the Milwaukee suburb of Greendale, Wisconsin, in November 2008. The move enabled the USBC to combine its operations with the Bowling Proprietors' Association of America (BPAA).\nPurpose.\nThe USBC is the national governing body for ten-pin bowling in the United States. It has approximately 3,000 local associations across the US serving over 2 million members. Among its duties and responsibilities to these members are:\nHistory.\nHistorically, the membership of the ABC was all male (white males only in 1916–1950), but beginning in 1993 women were permitted to join. In 1916 the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) was formed by a group of 40 women, and up until 2004 served as a partner organization of the ABC. The Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA) was established in 1982, after previously existing as the American Junior Bowling Congress founded in 1958, to serve youth bowlers from pre-school through collegiate level. Prior to the formation of the USBC, the national governing body for bowling was USA Bowling, which oversaw the participation of Team USA in international events. These four organizations merged to form USBC on January 1, 2005.\nUSBC Hall of Fame.\nThe USBC Hall of Fame was formed in 2005 by the merger of the ABC Hall of Fame (established 1941) and WIBC Hall of Fame (established 1953).\nAs of 2022, there are 446 Hall of Fame members in five categories:\n\"* Category introduced in 2011, with Jeff Richgels as the inaugural member. Recognizes those who have had noteworthy performances in one of the USBC national tournaments.\"\nThe USBC Hall of Fame has its home at the International Bowling Museum on the International Bowling Campus in Arlington, Texas (along with the International Bowling Hall of Fame). The induction ceremony is held annually in the spring.\nUSBC in the media.\nThe USBC Masters, one of four major tournaments the PBA holds each season, is conducted by the USBC as a part of the PBA Tour. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 events were all won by Australian Jason Belmonte, who became the only player in history to win this tournament in three consecutive years. Belmonte's streak was broken in by American 19-year-old Anthony Simonsen, who made history as the youngest-ever winner of a PBA major tournament. Belmonte won the for an unprecedented fourth Masters title. The most recent champion, crowned on April 2, 2023, is American Anthony Simonsen of Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThe USBC Queens, one of four major tournaments on the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) Tour, is conducted by the USBC. The 2019 event was won by Ukrainian-born Dasha Kovalova, who bowled collegiately at Wichita State University.\nThe USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships (ITC), the national championship of collegiate bowling, is conducted by USBC and has been televised on a tape-delay basis since 2002. For the first time, in 2012, USBC also televised the Intercollegiate Singles Championships as part of a four-week series on CBS Sports Network. Both events were televised in high definition for the first time in 2012.\nUSBC was the presenting sponsor of the PBA Women's Series for three seasons, beginning with the 2007–08 season. In the 2009–10 season, USBC changed the name of its presenting sponsorship to BOWL.com, the organization's website, which was re-launched on August 3, 2009. USBC did not renew its sponsorship for the 2010–11 season.\nIn 2007, USBC acquired the rights to the U.S. Women's Open from the Bowling Proprietors' Association of America (BPAA). The event, which had been on a three-year hiatus following the disbanding of the PWBA in 2003, was telecast for five weeks on ESPN in September–October 2007. ESPN again held multi-week broadcasts of the event in 2008, while ESPN2 did the same in 2009. In 2010, USBC reverted to a more traditional format and a one-day stepladder-style TV finals, airing live on ESPN2. That event was held in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, with Kelly Kulick winning. Kulick became the first bowler ever to win the USBC Queens and US Women's Open in the same year. USBC announced in May 2010 that it would not conduct the US Women's Open in 2011, as the BPAA had agreed to resume its association with the tournament. The TV finals took place June 30, 2011, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where Leanne Hulsenberg was crowned champion.\nIn May 2008, USBC conducted a special made-for-TV event called \"Bowling's Clash of the Champions\". The taped telecast was broadcast May 10 and 11 on CBS, marking the first time bowling had been broadcast on regular network television since June 26, 1999. The event featured eight male and eight female bowlers representing youth, college, senior, amateur and professional bowlers who had won recent USBC titles. It was won by Lynda Barnes. The event returned to CBS in 2009, when it was won by Chris Barnes, Lynda's husband.\nIn 2009, USBC began showing championship competition live free on its website, BOWL.com. In 2011, USBC moved this coverage to its YouTube channel, YouTube.com/BowlTV. BowlTV's coverage was primarily anchored by Lucas Wiseman before he left the organization in December 2015.\nIn 2018 controversy emerged over Executive Director Chad Murphy for bullying employees and committee members and manipulating the board nominating committee.\nUSBC rule changes.\nUSBC rule changes occur at the national convention, and take effect for leagues starting after August 1 of each year. Rule changes are published in a new printed guide every two years. Updated rulebooks are available online at bowl.com.\nSMART program.\nThe SMART program (Scholarship Management and Accounting Report for Tenpins) was established in 1994 in order to manage and store bowling scholarships until the youth bowler requests the use of the scholarships for college. The bowling scholarships can be from winning tournaments to filling out scholarship application forms. Recently the validity of the term \"scholarship\" for the SMART program has been questioned by the MHSAA (Michigan High School Athletic Association). The association questions where the education requirements are in earning the \"scholarships\". Most bowling scholarships earned are from winning a tournament, and are awarded as a cash prize in the form of a scholarship with no GPA or formal scholarly work necessary to claim the money once in college. This in turn has caused the MHSAA to rule high school athletes \"ineligible\" due to \"accepting cash, checks, or any other form of award over $25 in value.\" This rule is highly debated and has questionable means of enforcement.\nTo receive such scholarships, the athlete must simply sign into their SMART account and fill out the necessary information whereupon the money is sent directly to the schools, not given to the athlete themselves. There are special circumstances which allow money be sent directly to the athlete."

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri. \nBaseball.\nThe speedy Byrne was a defensive stalwart with excellent range. He started his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1907 season. Acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates in late August 1909, he contributed for his new club down the stretch, including allowing Tommy Leach to stay in center field. Used mainly in the leadoff spot by the Pirates, Byrne made just two errors while hitting .256 with eight stolen bases. \nByrne enjoyed his most productive season in , when he posted career-numbers in batting average (.296), runs batted in (52), runs (101), stolen bases (36), slugging percentage (.417), and led the National League with 178 hits and in doubles with 43 (also career highs).\nDespite a low .259 batting average in 1911, Byrne scored 96 runs with 23 stolen bases and set career highs in triples (17) and games played (153).

        "text": "David Michael Brown (4 April 1913 – 23 February 1974) was one of Australia's greatest rugby league footballers.\nBrown in his distinctive headgear was said to be one of the most admired sights in the game during the 1930s. He won two premierships with Easts and scored so many points, tries and goals and established so many records (some may never be bettered) that he is referred to as \"the Bradman of league\". In 2003 Brown was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and in 2008 he was named in the New South Wales rugby league team of the century. In 2018, Brown joined Rugby League's elite by being inducted as a Rugby League Immortal.\nBackground.\nBrown was born Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nAs a child Brown lost the top of his thumb in a lawn-mowing accident. While playing football at school he badly broke an arm, dislocating the elbow and causing severe nerve damage which cost him the use of two fingers on his right hand. Despite these setbacks Brown was an all-round sportsman – an A-grade tennis player, champion junior surfer and a representative cricketer. Brown attended Sydney's Waverley College under the tuition of Arthur Hennessy, Australia's first ever rugby league test captain, who was the school sporting coach at the time.\nStellar early career.\nThe powerfully built centre joined the Eastern Suburbs club straight out of school. After just a handful of lower grade games Brown was promoted to the top grade. The following year aged just eighteen Brown was selected to represent his state – New South Wales in 3 interstate matches against Queensland. Soon after the teenager lost all his hair, after contracting a virus while swimming and took to wearing a hairpiece to cover his baldness.\n At the beginning of the 1932 season, aged just nineteen years and twelve days, Brown was named captain of the Eastern Suburbs club. The following year he was selected for the 1933–34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. On the boat trip over one of his teammates, unable to stand the sight of Brown's hairpiece any longer, tossed it out one of the ship's portholes, causing him to begin wearing his trademark headgear. On the tour he played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour from 19 tries and 114 goals. In an exhibition match played in on a snow-covered ground between England and Australia, (the first rugby league game played on French soil) Brown scored 6 tries and kicked 9 goals for a total of 36 points.\nRecord breaking years.\nOnce home in Sydney, Brown led a star-studded Easts side to the 1934 minor premiership, losing to Western Suburbs in the premiership decider. In the following season – 1935, Easts lost just 1 match and captured their fifth premiership,\nThat 1935 season was Brown's best. In just fifteen club matches he scored 244 points (38 tries, 65 goals). His 1935 record try tally still stands: indeed Newtown winger Ray Preston remains the only other player to score more than 30 tries in a season, totaling 34 during the 1954 season. In the first round match against Canterbury-Bankstown Brown scored a premiership record 45 points (5 tries, 15 goals), with the 15 goal tally also standing as the record for goals in a match. In the second round match against Canterbury-Bankstown he scored a further 38 points (6 tries, 10 goals), which stands as the equal record for the second-most points in a premiership match. He recorded further records in round 16 when he scored 26 (4 tries, 7 goals) against North Sydney then in round 18 against Balmain he notched up a further 32 points, from 6 tries and 7 goals. The pointscoring wizard amassed 385 points that year (incorporating all Eastern Suburbs and representative matches). What make his records all the more impressive is that during the 1934, 1935 and 1936 seasons Brown was not the only goalkicker at the club, with teammate Jack Beaton taking many of the easier shots for goal.\nOn 28 September 1935, at just 22 years and 177 days Brown was named as the youngest ever Australian captain, and led his country to a series victory over New Zealand. In 1936 Easts again took out the NSWRL season title, this time finishing undefeated.\nWarrington and final playing years.\nAt the end of the 1936 season Brown accepted an offer from English rugby league club, Warrington, a four-year deal worth 1,000 pounds for the first season (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £161,800 in 2013).\nBrown played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored 2-tries in Warrington's 8–4 victory over Barrow in the 1937–38 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1937–38 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 October 1937.\nBrown played 93 matches for the Warrington Wolves, scoring 326 points – 48 tries and 91 goals. In a cup semi final against St Helens Brown kicked what he considers to be his finest goal, it is recounted this way. \n\"with the scores locked at 2-all in the dying moments Warrington were awarded a penalty near the touch-line and five-yards on their own side of half-way, Brown took the shot, guiding it between the posts to give Warrington a 4–2 win and a spot in the Cup final.\"\nBut Brown never enjoyed quite the same level of success in England; he bought out the final year of his contract and returned home.\nOnce home Brown rejoined the Eastern Suburbs club, playing in the remaining matches of the 1939 season. In 1940 with Dave Brown appointed as captain and coach of the side, Easts finished the year at the top of the league ladder and despite losing Brown with a leg injury, managed to capture another premiership. 1941 was to be Brown's last season. Easts again finished first at the end of the regular season but went down to St George in the premiership decider. Brown at twenty-nine years old announced his retirement following the match.\nPost-football.\nAfter his retirement from the game Brown took up a position as the games liaison officer, promoting rugby league in schools. He also spent time coaching and promoting the game in South Africa\nDave Brown 'The Bradman of League' died from cancer in 1974, 40 days before his 61st birthday. He was survived by two sisters, nephews, nieces, and his records.\nAccolades.\nIn 2003 he was admitted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. Up until 1986 the award for the best player in the Grand Final each year was known as the Dave Brown Medal. Dave Brown was also named in the centres, alongside Dally Messenger in the Eastern Suburbs club's greatest team. Additionally, a plaque in the Walk of Honour at the Sydney Cricket Ground commemorates his career.\nIn February 2008, Brown was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In 2008 Brown was also named in New South Wales' rugby league team of the century.\nJoining fellow pre-WWII greats Dally Messenger and Frank Burge, Brown was inducted as a Rugby League Immortal in 2018, along with recent greats Norm Provan and Mal Meninga."

He played the full 1961 season with the club, but thereafter spent most of the next seven seasons in the minor leagues, winning Second All-Star Team accolades with the Oklahoma City Blazers of the CHL in 1966.\nWith the expansion in 1967 Smith made the Bruins for good and, partnered with superstar Bobby Orr on defence, led the NHL in plus/minus the first season the statistic was officially tabulated. He gained a reputation as a solid defensive defenceman — as well as a wide repute as the league's strongest man, bolstered by his ownership of a Manitoba farm. His best season was in 1971, during which he had his career high of 45 points, played in the NHL All-Star Game and finished with a plus/minus of +94, the fourth-highest total in history.\nSmith began the 1977 season after an acrimonious contract dispute which saw him sign a one-year contract the day before the season began, and which caused him to miss training camp. He was named interim captain of the Bruins after longtime captain John Bucyk was injured, but left the team in March after a dispute, playing for the Canadian national team in the 1977 World Championships after that. He signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers in December 1977 at the importuning of old teammate Phil Esposito, but his skills had significantly diminished, retired at season's end.\nSmith finished his NHL career with 55 goals, 307 assists and 959 penalty minutes in 890 games. He currently lives in retirement in Phoenix."

The second was to promote the sport of triathlon in the SEAL Teams where physical training was multi-faceted and competitive spirit is high. The event is open to both military and civilians alike. It also invites tri-athletes with disabilities to participate in the triathlon as individuals or in relay teams. All editions have been carefully monitored and supported by UDT-SEAL Association members and volunteers and officers and men of the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training department from the Navy Special Warfare Command.\nThe Superfrog is a traditional swim-bike-run event that covers a course consisting of a two-lap 1.2 miles open ocean swim, a four-lap 56 mile bike course and a five-lap 13.1 mile run. This type of circuit-style racing allows for a central control point where start and finish lines, bike/run transition area, racer aid stations, and spectators view are greatly enhanced. This circuit-style race is presented by Naval Special Warfare and sponsored by MWR, North Island. \nThe open-ocean swim starts at 7am behind the BUD/S, NSW Center area and finishes behind SEAL Teams Five and Seven. Wheel-chair racers enter the ocean first, followed by individual racers and three-person relay teams.\nPrevious editions were held in the month of September. The September high surf is usually accompanied by unusually cold water. Upon completion of the swim, the bicycle riders head south from the Amphibious Base along Highway 75. It is flat but can be a little windy in some sections. Competitors in the event have been subjected to 100-degree heat on the highway. In 2011, the half-Ironman triathlon is back to September, being run on the 10 year anniversary of 9/11 - 11 September 2011.\nIn previous editions several professional triathletes competed in this event, including Bettina Ernst (1996), Paula Newby-Fraser (2002), Heather Fuhr (2006), and Lance Armstrong (2012).\nIn January 2015, World Triathlon Corporation announced the acquisition of SuperFrog, Inc., owners of the SuperFrog, Super Seal and Seal Sprint triathlons.

        "title": "1979 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1979 Tour de France was the 66th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 27 June and 22 July, with 24 stages covering a distance of . It was the only tour to finish at Alpe d'Huez twice. It was won by Bernard Hinault, who also won the points classification, and whose team won both team classifications. Remarkably Hinault and second-place finisher Joop Zoetemelk finished nearly a half hour ahead of the other GC Contenders, and in modern history this was the only time the Yellow Jersey was challenged on the ride into Paris. The mountains classification was won by Giovanni Battaglin, and the young rider classification was won by Jean-René Bernaudeau.\nTeams.\nThe following 15 teams each sent 10 cyclists, for a total of 150.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe big favourite was Hinault; not only was he the defending champion, but the large number of time trials made the race especially suited for him. The only cyclist thought to be able to seriously challenge Hinault was Zoetemelk, the runner-up of the previous edition.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1979 Tour was revealed in November 1978. It was the shortest course since 1904, but with many climbs it was still considered hard.\nSince 1974, the Tour had always been composed of 22 stages, with some of them run as split stages. Following the riders' strike in the 1978 Tour against these split stages, the 1979 Tour included no split stages. To compensate for this, the total number of stages increased to 24. The Tour had one rest day, in Les Menuires. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 17.\nRace overview.\nThe prologue was won by Knetemann; Zoetemelk and Hinault both followed at four seconds. The first stage took the riders immediately into the mountains. During stage one Jean-René Bernaudeau and René Bittinger got to the front of the peloton with Bittinger claiming the stage win by eight seconds, and Bernaudeau taking 2nd but moving into the overall race lead.\nStage two would be the final stage someone not named Bernard Hinault or Joop Zoetemelk would wear the maillot jaune, which was a mountain climb individual time trial where the top 5 finishers moved into the top 5 in the overall standings. Hinault won the stage and took over the race lead as Zoetemelk moved into 2nd place overall while Joaquim Agostinho, Hennie Kuiper and Sven-Åke Nilsson rounded out the top 5. Stage three ended up as a sprint finish decided amongst the strongest riders who had survived the climbs. Hinault edged Rudy Pevenage at the line but as the strongest riders had finished together there was no change atop the General classification. Stage four was a team time trial won by the consistently dominant squad with the very strong team finishing 2nd. Neither of these teams had a GC rider who was a clear and present threat to Hinault, however the 3rd and 4th place teams in and did with Kuiper and Zoetemelk. Hinault's squad finished in 5th place overall, meaning he lost time to all of these teams and his lead was now only 0:12 over Zoetemelk and 0:31 over Kuiper, who was upset at the missed opportunity following this stage as the team had chosen the wrong tires and punctured numerous times likely costing him the chance to overtake Hinault and Zoetemelk.\nAgostinho and his team finished 6th moving him from a tie for 2nd with Zoetemelk to 4th place overall just 0:10 ahead of Ake-Nilsson. Stage five was a flat stage where Jan Raas outsprinted Jacques Esclassan, the up-and-coming Irishman Sean Kelly, Marc Demeyer and Hinault for the win with no changes among the GC riders. Stage six saw all five out of the five top 5 finishers from the previous day once again competing for the win except this time Joseph Jacobs was able to get ahead of Hinault, Raas, Kelly, Demeyer and Esclassan to win the day by a single second. Hinault's 2nd-place finish added 0:12 to his lead over the riders closest to him in the overall standings. Stage seven came down to a three rider escape involving Christian Levavasseur, Christian Poirier and Leo van Vliet where van Vliet took the stage win as the overall situation remained static.\nStage eight was another team time trial which caused some movement in the standings. TI–Raleigh and Ijsboerke were once again among the strongest teams and were separated by only 0:08 with Raleigh claiming another win. As a result, their highest place rider Ueli Sutter moved into 4th place overall. Ijsboerke finished 3rd behind Hinault's Renault team, who put together a very strong ride finishing in 2nd just 0:06 behind Raleigh. The Miko–Mercier squad of Zoetemelk and Nilsson finished 4th but lost nearly two minutes to Renault meaning Hinault now had some breathing room leading Zoetemelk by 1:18 and the now 3rd place Nilsson by 2:40. The Peugeot–Esso team of Kuiper and the Flandria team of Agostinho fared poorly with Kuiper dropping from 3rd to 7th place at 4:30 behind, whereas Agostinho remained in 5th place, but was now 4:05 back. Stage nine was a pivotal stage that had major ramifications for the top riders who had to contend with the much dreaded cobblestones of Roubaix. Any of the cobbled sections included in the Tour are always treacherous, they result in numerous, if not dozens of minor and occasionally major crashes, many riders get multiple flat tires and depending on the weather it is either intolerably hot and dusty or so muddy that no rider has a clean face by the end of the stage.\nThis stage was no different and in the end a group of five riders survived to the finish line in the lead group where André Dierickx, Didi Thurau, Michel Pollentier and Zoetemelk crossed the line 0:19 behind Ludo Delcroix. Hinault was actually able to distance himself and gain time on many of the other GC riders and the ones he did not gain time on he stayed even with. Nilsson, Sutter and Kuiper all crossed with the same time as Hinault whereas other top 10 riders going into the stage including Gery Verlinden and Bernaudeau lost time to him. Joaquim Agostinho had a disastrous day in which he lost his 5th place, fell out of the top 10 altogether and was more than 10:00 behind Hinault. By his standards Hinault also had a disastrous day, as he lost the yellow jersey, which he was not happy about as he threatened following the stage that, \"there are some riders who will suffer plenty after what happened today\", in reference to the select group of riders who got away from him and survived in the breakaway. Of the 5 breakaway survivors Dierickx gained enough time to come within about 3:00 of Hinault but he was not considered a realistic threat. Neither was the stage winner Delcroix and while Thurau or Pollentier might have been threats if they had gaps upwards of ten minutes on Hinault, both of them were still ten minutes or more behind the Badger and therefore irrelevant as far as his pursuit of his 2nd Tour victory was concerned.\nAs such his anger was seemingly directed primarily at Zoetemelk, who had taken over the lead by 2:08, and was a very real threat to Hinault. In essence the only rider that could beat him, did beat him, and beat him by a considerable margin somehow finding a way to avoid the crashes, the flat tires, the protesters and ‘surviving’ within the winning group of this stage of the Tour which was borrowed from The Hell of the North. Even though Hinault had dropped to 2nd place more than two minutes off the lead, Five time tour champion Jacques Anquetil was pleased with the way Hinault responded following this stage and predicted that Hinault won the Tour, because he had kept his losses limited. In stage ten Jo Maas outlasted his breakaway companions including Pol Verschuere and Ludo Peeters to take the stage win and jump into the top 10 overall as the breakaway had finished close to ten minutes ahead of the peloton. During the stage eleven ITT it became a near certainty that the battle for the 1979 Tour de France would be decided solely between Hinault and Zoetemelk as following this stage the 3rd place rider would be more than 7:00 behind. Hinault won the stage by a narrow margin of just eight seconds over Knut Knudsen but more importantly he cut Zoetemelk's lead from 2:08 down to 1:32.\nDuring stage twelve Christian Seznec beat Joseph Borguet by one second to win the stage as Hennie Kuiper, who started the day in 5th place at 8:00 off the lead joined in the attacks to try to cut into Zoetemelk and Hinault. He managed to win a decent chunk of time back and in the process jumped back into 3rd at +6:09. In stage thirteen however, he would lose back much of the time he gained. Winning the stage three seconds ahead of Rudy Pevenage, was Pierre-Raymond Villemiane who jumped from 10th place up to 6th. Villemiane was a distant threat to the leaders and therefore not pursued by either of their teams, but Hinault did manage to take a three-second bite out of Zoetemelk's lead cutting it down to +1:29. In stage fourteen Zoetemelk added 0:20 to his lead over 3rd place Kuiper, 4th place Sutter and 5th place Nilsson, however Hinault was able to get away from Zoetemelk and win back 0:40 on the Dutchman, cutting his lead to under a minute. Finishing atop the stage podium was Demeyer, followed by Esclassan and Kelly.\nStage 15 was another mountain ITT, which was once again won by Bernard Hinault who put himself back into the yellow jersey. The majority of the ninety-something riders remaining in the race finished well beyond +5:00 of Hinault with only Zoetemelk keeping him under 3:00. Hinault's lead over 5th place Nilsson was just over 14:00, he was 13:00 ahead of 4th place Sutter, nearly 12:00 ahead of 3rd place Kuiper, but only 1:48 ahead of 2nd placed Zoetemelk, a lead he was not satisfied with going into the high mountains of The French Alps. As such Hinault went on the offensive in stage sixteen where he finished just six seconds behind Lucien Van Impe. Van Impe had a rocky start to this Tour but was slowly clawing his way back towards the top 10, even though he was always more concerned with his place within the King of the Mountains competition, not the general classification. More importantly Hinault nearly added another minute to his lead over Zoetemelk, who was now +2:45 behind, as the race headed for back to back hilltop finishes atop Alpe d'Huez following rest day. By the end of stage seventeen the 3rd place rider would be nearly +20:00 behind Hinault, but surprisingly moving all the way back to 5th place was Joaquim Agostinho who put in a masterful performance to win the stage coming all the way back from where his Tour disastrously fell apart back on the cobbles of Roubaix. Meanwhile, Hinault and Zoetemelk crossed the line together some three minutes later with the two of them still separated by +2:45 and only one major mountain stage remaining.\nThe 2nd hilltop finish at Alpe d'Huez in stage eighteen was the final chance to gain time in the high mountains. The stage was won by Zoetemelk with an advantage of +0:40 over Van Impe. Zoetemelk also managed to drop Hinault near the end of the stage and cut his lead to just under two minutes prior to the final ITT. Continuing on his impressive performance from the day before was Agostinho who finished both in 4th place on the stage, and also climbed up a spot to 4th place in the overall standings, albeit more than twenty minutes behind Hinault. Stage nineteen was won by Didi Thurau who outsprinted Jacobs, Demeyer and Hinault to claim the win. Then during stage 20 Serge Parsani got to the line two seconds slower than the speedy Dutchman Gerrie Knetemann, but Knetemann was given a ten-second penalty for drafting a team car earlier in the stage, which gave Parsani the stage win by eight seconds. The final ITT was in the city of Dijon where Hinault seemingly clinched his 2nd consecutive Tour de France victory building his lead over Zoetemelk to +3:07. The closest rider from within the rest of the field was Agostinho, who jumped into the final podium position but was still nearly twenty-five minutes behind. Stage twenty-two was won in a head-to-head sprint by Gerrie Knetemann over Giovanni Battaglin and in Stage twenty-three Hinault was able to best Demeyer at the finish line.\nWith the Tour unofficially over and only the ride down the Champs-Élysées remaining stage twenty-four began with the peloton headed towards the finish line in Paris. There were a few escape attempts early in the stage including by Thurau and Zoetemelk, who was trying to get away from Hinault. At 124 kilometres into the stage Hinault left everyone behind and only Zoetemelk went off in pursuit. It took him four kilometres to catch Hinault and by 129 kilometres into the stage this 'royal escape' was turned loose with the teams of both riders controlling the peloton from then on. The time gap between the duo of Hinault and Zoetemelk and the peloton steadily increased from that point on and continued to increase on the laps of the Champs-Élysées. It must certainly have been an unfamiliar sight for the fans in attendance to see the Tour fought over until the last kilometre had been ridden. Hinault crossed the line about a bike length ahead of Zoetemelk and about two and half minutes later the bunch sprint began for 3rd place with Dietrich Thurau edging out Jacques Bossis and Paul Sherwen. Just as the day began with Hinault in the lead by +3:07, it ended with Bernard Hinault as Tour de France champion by +3:07 over Joop Zoetemelk, who had now finished in 2nd place in the Tour de France for a record 5th time, which in and of itself is remarkable considering the ‘Eternal Second’ Raymond Poulidor only finished 2nd three times. Something that did change was the 3rd place rider Agostinho was now nearly a half hour behind. Winning the points classification was Hinault, the mountains classification was won by Giovanni Battaglin, the young rider classification went to Jean-Renè Bernaudeau and the Combativity award was presented to Zoetemelk, \n who won the award ahead of Battaglin who in addition to winning the KOM competition, also finished 6th and was named the most combative rider on four stages.\nBesides the struggle for the first place, there was also a noteworthy struggle for the last place, the lanterne rouge. After the 20th stage, Philippe Tesnière was last in the general classification, with Gerhard Schönbacher before him. Tesnière had already finished last in the 1978 Tour de France, so he was aware of the publicity associated with being the lanterne rouge.\nIn the 21st stage, Tesnière therefore rode extra slow. Hinault took 1 hour, 8 minutes and 53 seconds to win the time trial, Schönbacher used 1 hour, 21 minutes and 52 seconds, while Tesniere rode it in 1 hour, 23 minutes and 32 seconds; both were slower than all other cyclists. Tesnière's time was more than 20% slower than Hinault's, which meant that he had missed the time cut, and was taken out of the race. When Schönbacher was near the finish of the last stage, he stopped and kissed the road, before he crossed the finishline.\nDoping.\nFor the first time in the Tour de France, doping tests were able to find anabolicals. The doping tests were performed by Manfred Donike in his lab in Cologne.\nAfter the 17th stage, it was announced that Giovanni Battaglin, leader of the mountains classification, had tested positive after the 13th stage. He received a penalty of 10 minutes in the general classification, and lost all mountain points that he collected during that 13th stage, and an extra penalty of 10 points.\nFrans Van Looy and Gilbert Chaumaz also tested positive for doping.\nAfter the race finished, Joop Zoetemelk was found to have used doping, which he later admitted to. Zoetemelk was fined with 10 minutes in the general classification, and lost his combativity award, but still officially remained in 2nd place by more than ten minutes. His label as an 'eternal second' would permanently be removed the following year.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1979 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. In previous years, the team time trials only counted for the team classification, and not for the general classification, except for the bonifications. From 1979 on, the team trial also counted for the general classification.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification, decided the same way as the general classification. Since 1975, the young rider classification had been contested by neo-professionals: cyclists aged 23 years or younger, or in their first two years as a professional cyclist. This changed in 1979: it was open for cyclists aged 24 or younger at 1 January. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1979, this classification had no associated jersey. In stages 6, 12, 14, 20, 22 and 23, there was a new system for time bonuses. In the intermediate sprints in these stages, the first three cyclists received time bonuses of 10, 6 and 3 seconds; a classification of these time bonuses was made on each of these stages, and the first three of this classification received extra time bonuses of 20, 10 and 5 seconds.\nThe team classification in 1977 was calculated with the times of the five best cyclists per team, but was in 1978 changed to the best four cyclists. The leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. Inoxpran, , Magniflex and did not finish the race with four or more cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team classification. Magniflex and did not finish the race with three or more cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team points classification.\nIn addition to the classifications above, there were several minor classifications; in total the 1979 Tour de France contained sixteen competitions, each with its own sponsor. In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Joop Zoetemelk won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award; he was later disqualified after his doping offence (see below) and Hennie Kuiper received the award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 17. This prize was won by Lucien Van Impe.\nAftermath.\nThe Tour organisation did not like the attention that the last-placed riders received, and for the next year made a new rule that after several stages the last-placed cyclist in the general classification would be removed from the race."

Their first appearance was in the 1993 tournament which was held in Scotland. They were knocked out in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners England (21–12) before finishing in 7th place.

In 2009, they lost to Wales in the quarter-finals (15–14) and would finish in 5th place. They then would go on to win the next two World Cups in 2013 and 2018 by beating England in both tournaments (33–0) and (33–12), to become the first team in history to go back to back in consecutive tournaments. In 2022, they lost to Fiji in the final once again by (27–12), and finished runners-up for the second time in their World Cup history.\nCommonwealth Games.\nNew Zealand have found the most success in the Commonwealth Games Sevens Series by winning 5 out of the 7 Tournaments.

In 2022 after having the best round-robin record of (5–1), they secured the title. In 2023, they retained their title after defeating Samoa (24–19) in the Final. They have been runners-up 4 times, the first being in 2014 by losing to Fiji in the final (5–21), the second time was in 2017 when they lost to Fiji again in the final (0–26), the third time was in 2018, when they lost to Fiji again for the 3rd straight final (12–17), and the 4th time would be by having the 2nd best round-robin record in 2021 (4–2), behind Fiji who had a better record (6–0), and they would also finish the 2019 competition in 7th place.\nRecords.\nWorld Sevens Series.\nNew Zealand have won the World Rugby Sevens Series a record 14 times.

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured South Africa for cricket matches in the 2005–06 season. Owing to South Africa's busy schedule, the tour was split into two legs, one to be played in October 2005 with the six limited overs matches (one Twenty20 International and five One Day Internationals), and the second leg to be played in April and May 2006, including three Test matches. Before the limited overs series began, New Zealand were ranked third on the ICC ODI Championship table, two places ahead of their hosts South Africa. However, New Zealand had never won an ODI series in South Africa before this tour, and they were not to do it this summer either. In fact, New Zealand did not win a single one of the five matches, and only the rain – which sent the fourth match into a no-result – prevented the Kiwis from going down 0–5. The test series was similarly disappointing for New Zealand, with South Africa claiming it 2-0. After two series losses to Australia it was a satisfying result for the South Africans.\nSquads.\nThe New Zealand squad of 15 players for the ODI series of the tour was announced on 26 September 2005. Chris Cairns was excluded over fitness issues while Jeetan Patel was included following good performances during the Zimbabwe tour the previous season. From the ODI squad that toured the Caribbean earlier that year, the South Africa squad had Herschelle Gibbs included for the First ODI, who was out due to injury, in place of Justin Ontong. Albie Morkel was drafted only for the T20I fixture in the same squad. AB de Villiers, who was named in squads for both ODI and T20I series, was released to play domestic cricket for his side, the Titans, thus missing the lone T20I and the First ODI fixtures, as part of the player-rotation policy employed by the selectors. While he returned to the squad for the Second ODI, Andrew Hall left to play domestic cricket. Boeta Dippenaar, who picked up an injury during the First ODI, was ruled out of the remainder of the series and was replaced by Andrew Puttick. Puttick was replaced by Jacques Rudolph for the Third ODI. In their 13-man squad announced for the final two ODIs, Gibbs and Nicky Boje, who announced dropping out of the India tour, were replaced by Hall and Morkel for South Africa.\nThe New Zealand squad for the Test series was announced on 28 March 2006. Two additions were made to the squad that was playing the West Indies. Opening batsman Michael Papps was recalled to the side alongside all-rounder Jacob Oram. Shane Bond was ruled of the First Test after he sustained a knee injury in the four-day warm-up game. Kyle Mills was named his replacement in the playing XI. For the Second Test, Michael Mason was added to the squad his cover. While Bond was ruled out for the series, Hamish Marshall pulled out due to a rib injury following the First Test.\nA 16-man South Africa squad for the Test was announced on 9 April. The same squad named for the completed home series against Australia was named. Gibbs and Kruger were dropped from the squad for the Second and Tests after poor performances in the First."

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup qualification is a set of competitive matches that a national association football team plays in order to qualify for one of the available berths at the final tournament of the men's FIFA World Cup.\nQualifying tournaments are held within the six FIFA continental zones, each organized by their respective confederations: AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North and Central America and the Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), and UEFA (Europe). For each World Cup, FIFA decides the number of places in the finals allocated to each of the zones, based on the numbers and relative strengths of the confederations' teams.\nAs a courtesy, the host receives an automatic berth selection, as has happened with the immediate past tournament winner during much of the competition's history. All other finalists are determined on a standalone qualifying round achievement without regard to previous achievements.\nHistory.\nThe berths for the inaugural 1930 tournament were filled by invitation only. The 1934 one was the first one to have an actual qualifying phase. The first ever World Cup qualifying match was played on 11 June 1933, when Sweden defeated Estonia 6–2 in Stockholm, and the first goal was scored 7 minutes into the game, with some sources attributing it to Swedish captain Knut Kroon while others credit it as an own goal by the Estonian goalkeeper Evald Tipner.\nThe number of teams entering qualification stages has increased steadily, and in response the final tournament has also been expanded (having 16 teams until 1978, then 24 between 1982 and 1994, then 32 between 1998 and 2022, and finally 48 from 2026 onwards). While the format of the qualifying tournaments has evolved, teams have always been grouped into zones which have remained relatively unchanged and roughly correspond to the continents. The teams from each zone compete for a fixed number of berths for the zone, with a limited number of places being awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs.\nQualification berths by continent.\nThe table below lists the numbers of berths allocated by FIFA for each continent in each tournament. It also shows the total number of teams that entered and played in every qualification cycle.\nIn the table, \"H\" denotes an automatic spot for the host, \"C\" denotes an automatic spot for the defending champion, and \"inv\" indicates the number of teams that were invited in 1930. Places in intercontinental play-offs are represented as fractions, as follows:\nFirst appearance in qualification by team.\nOnly teams that played at least one match are considered for first appearance. Teams that withdrew before the qualification, or that qualified to the World Cup by walkover due to other teams' withdrawals, are not considered.\nOverview of teams' participations.\nThe below table shows how every team has participated in each World Cup qualification.\nKey\nOverall team records.\nThe below table compares the overall records of all teams that have participated in qualification. Teams are ordered by points using the three points for a win system, then by goal difference, and then by goals scored. Note that this order does not represent any official rankings, and qualification tournaments are not direct competitions among all teams.\nThe \"Qualifying attempts\" column counts qualifying campaigns where the team played at least one match that was not annulled. An attempt is treated as \"successful\" if the team gained the right to participate in the finals, even if it did not appear there eventually.\nAs per statistical convention in football, goals scored during extra time are counted towards matches' scorelines and outcomes, while goals scored during penalty shoot-outs are not. Annulled matches are not counted; for matches that were annulled and then replayed, only the replays are counted. For matches where the scorelines were awarded, the awarded scorelines, and not the original ones (if any), are counted.\nEcuador was deducted 3 points in the 2026 qualifying, which is reflected in the table.\nTeams in bold are currently participating or are yet to start in the 2026 qualification. The table is updated to the matches played in March 2024.\nQualification tournament rules.\nQualification tournaments generally consist of a number of stages, made up of groups or knock-out ties.\nGroups.\nIn all group tournaments, three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. FIFA has set the order of the tie-breakers for teams that finish level on points:\nWhere teams are still not able to be separated, the following tie-breakers are used:\nWhere teams are still equal, then a play-off on neutral ground, with extra time and penalties if necessary will be played if FIFA deems such a play-off able to be fitted within the coordinated international match calendar. If this is not deemed feasible, then the result will be determined by fair play points and then the drawing of lots.\nNote that this order of tie-breaker application has not always been applied. While it was used in the 2010 qualifiers, the qualification for the 2006 World Cup used the head-to-head comparison prior to goal difference (although this system was – where applicable – used in the 2006 finals themselves). If these rules had applied in 2006, then Nigeria would have qualified rather than Angola.\nHome-and-away ties.\nMost knock-out qualifiers (such as the inter-confederation play-offs and many preliminary ties) are played over two legs. The team that scores a greater aggregate number of goals qualifies. Away goals rule applies. If these rules fail to determine the winner, extra time and penalty shootouts are used.\nOccasionally – usually when one entrant lacks adequate facilities to host international matches – ties are played over a single leg, in which case matches level after 90 minutes will go to extra time and then to a penalty shootout if required.\nAlternatively, \"home\" matches can be played in neutral countries, or occasionally one team will host both matches. In the latter case the visiting team will still be considered as the \"home\" team for one of the legs – which may determine which side advances under the away goals rule, as occurred in CONCACAF qualification in 2010."

        "title": "Dan Quinn (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Daniel Peter Quinn (born June 1, 1965) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former professional golfer. Quinn played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Quinn was born in Ottawa, Ontario, but grew up in Brockville, Ontario.\nCalgary Flames.\nQuinn was drafted 13th overall by the Calgary Flames in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, while he was playing for the Belleville Bulls of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Quinn made his debut with Calgary halfway through the next season, scoring 52 points in 54 games. When he was called up he had been leading the OHL in scoring with 59 points. During his third season with the Flames, he scored 30-goals and 72-points and then added 15 more points in 18 playoff games as he advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where his Flames were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens. The next season, on November 12, 1986, Quinn was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Mike Bullard.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nIn Pittsburgh, Quinn had the most success, scoring a career high 40 goals in 1987–88, and a career-high 94 points the next season. He was unable to duplicate the success the next year and after struggling with just 29 points in the first 41 games of the 1989-90 season he was on the move again. \nVancouver Canucks.\nQuinn was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in 1990 in a six-player swap and he scored at nearly a point-a-game clip after the deal. The following year his production slipped and by the trade deadline he was on the move again as the Canucks shipped him to St. Louis in a seven-player blockbuster trade.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nQuinn finished the year putting up 11-points in 14-games then added 11 more in 13 playoff games for the Blues but it wasn't enough to secure him a spot in the lineup. After the season, the Blues lost veteran defenseman Harold Snespts to retirement and then lost their captain and top blue liner Scott Stevens as compensation for a free agent signing leaving a big hole on their defence. In an effort to fix this Quinn was packaged up with young forward Rod Brind'Amour and dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for tough defenseman Murray Baron and centre Ron Sutter.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nWhile Brind'Amour was an immediate success in Philadelphia, leading the team in scoring, Quinn struggled to find the net and managed just 37 points in 67 games. This marked the worst production of his career and spelled the end for his time with the Flyers. Quinn failed to find a new club over the summer before finally signing a deal on the eve of the 1992-93 season with the Minnesota North Stars.\nMinnesota North Stars.\nQuinn got off to a slow start with the North Stars with no-goals and just four assists in his first eleven games before his season - and is career - got derailed. Quinn was alleged to have raped a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Minnesota after a game with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Quinn maintained that he and the woman had sex, but that it was consensual. The police did not press charges, but the team released him from his contract saying that he violated the team curfew on the night of the incident.\nUnable to find an NHL team willing to take a chance on him, Quinn signed in Switzerland for the 1993-94 and finished just two points shy of leading the team in scoring despite playing eleven less games than the team leader. This production was enough to attract NHL attention once again.\nOttawa Senators.\nOn March 15, 1994, with the season winding down, Quinn's hometown Ottawa Senators inked him to a free agent deal and he paid immediate dividends scoring 7 goals in 13-games with the club to finish the season. \nLos Angeles Kings.\nQuinn signed a free agent deal with the Los Angeles Kings though an NHL lockout that delayed the start of the year allowed him to return to Switzerland for seven games before the NHL started up. With the Kings Quinn scored 31 points in 44 games good for third on the team in scoring.\nAfter the year, he was a free agent once again and once again inked a deal with his hometown club.\nOttawa Senators second stint.\nQuinn once again was productive with the Senators producing at close to a point per game for Ottawa. The Senators usual first line centre Alexei Yashin was holding out for a new contract pushing Quinn into a primary role where he delivered for the club. Quinn set a then-team record with a six-point game versus the Tampa Bay Lightning but despite all this, the Senators traded him to Philadelphia after just 28 games where he produced 24 points.\nPhiladelphia Flyers second stint.\nQuinn's production dipped in Philadelphia with 22 points in 35 games despite the fact he was slotted in, briefly, on the Flyers top line with John LeClair and Eric Lindros. Quinn left the Flyers after the season as a free agent.\nPittsburgh Penguins second stint.\nQuinn signed a one-year deal to return to the scene of his high scoring seasons in Pittsburgh but he was unable to replicate his success. After 16 games where Quinn posted no goals and just three assists the Penguins released him and he announced his retirement from hockey in November of 1996.\nGolf.\nQuinn embarked on a career in golf after his NHL career, and was one of the top players on the Celebrity Tour. In 2000, he caddied for John Daly at the U.S. Open. Quinn also caddies part-time for Ernie Els.\nAt the end of April 2014, Quinn became caddie for golfer Joost Luiten from the Netherlands, ranked number 43 at the Official World Golf Ranking.\nQuinn has competed at the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic, an annual competition to determine the best golfers among American sports and entertainment celebrities. He won the tournament in 1992, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2012, and has a total of eighteen top-10 finishes. The tournament, televised by NBC in July, is played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\nQuinn has also played in four Web.com Tour events, but never made the 36-hole cut.\nPersonal.\nQuinn currently resides in Florida with his wife and their two daughters and a son."

        "text": "Charles Gabriel Grant (born September 3, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs.\nGrant was also a member of the Miami Dolphins, Omaha Nighthawks and Chicago Bears.\nEarly years.\nPlayed for Miller County High School in Colquitt, Georgia in 1998, where he was both an offensive and defensive player. He later played both offense and defense at Hargrave Military Academy in 1998. Was a Parade Magazine 1997 All-American. He tied Herschel Walker's state single-season touchdown record with 45 in 1997 and added 3,472 all-purpose yards. Totaled 101 touchdowns in his three-year career at Miller County (Ga.) HS.\nCollege career.\nThree-year letterman and two-year starter at the University of Georgia. Ended career with 136 tackles, 27 tackles-for-loss and 15 sacks. Sack total ranks sixth on the school's all-time list. Totaled 63 tackles and six sacks as a junior in 2001. As a freshman, recorded 33 tackles and seven sacks, while also seeing duty in offensive backfield, rushing for 79 yards and three touchdowns at fullback. Majored in arts and sciences. \nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nGrant was drafted by the Saints with the 25th pick overall in the 2002 NFL draft. The Saints acquired the pick that was used to draft Grant through a trade with the Miami Dolphins that sent Ricky Williams to Miami. Grant's seven sacks in 2002 were the fourth-highest total for a Saints rookie, and he recorded 20.5 sacks from 2003-04. He was the second of two first-round picks (25th overall) for New Orleans in 2002, following wide receiver Donte' Stallworth (13th overall). He finished second with seven sacks for minus-40 yards, 36 tackles (32 solo), two passes defensed, four forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. Appeared in 16 games and started six at LDE. Finished tied for 20th in the NFC with seven sack total. Grant got a six-year extension with the Saints on July 27, 2002. After showing glimpses of his vast potential as a rookie, Grant came through with a big season and started all 16 games in 2003. He led the team with 10 sacks and three forced fumbles, and led the defensive line with 53 tackles (39 solo). He started all 16 contests for the second-straight season in 2004 and paced the defensive line with 113 tackles (69 solo) while posting a career-high 10.5 sacks. He also posted his first career interception. In 2005, he appeared in all 16 contests, starting 14 games at RDE, recording 62 tackles (44 solo), 2.5 sacks, two passes defensed and a fumble recovery. He bounced back from a relatively subpar season in 2006 with 6 sacks and 64 tackles (49 solo) in 16 games. He also collected 3 forced fumbles with 2 recoveries and 6 passes defensed. 2007 was Grant's worst season as a pro statistically, as he appeared in 14 of 16 games and compiled only 2.5 sacks to go along with 48 tackles (39 solo). He also chipped in with 2 passes defensed. \nGrant underwent surgery on a torn ligament in his left ankle the 2007-2008 offseason. Grant apparently injured his ankle on October 28, 2007 but was able to return after missing two games. The severity of the injury was known by the Saints, but never discussed with the media, and Grant admitted that he was not as sharp after the injury.\nOn December 2, 2008, he received a four-game suspension for use of a diuretic, which can be used a masking agent for steroid use. It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking. Charles Grant was due to be suspended for the first 4 games of the Saints' 2009 season, but the league has delayed suspension pending the outcome of a filed litigation by Kevin Williams and Pat Williams of the Minnesota Vikings, who were also accused for using the same diuretic. After starting at left defensive end throughout the regular season, he went on injured reserve for the playoffs with a torn triceps. (He nevertheless received a Super Bowl ring in recognition of his role in the Saints' championship season.) Grant was released by the Saints on March 5, 2010.\nMiami Dolphins.\nAfter he left the Saints, Grant briefly appeared on the roster of the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League, but he did not actually join the team once it appeared that he could continue with an NFL career. Grant signed a two-year contract with the Miami Dolphins on July 28, 2010. The Dolphins cut Grant on September 5, 2010.\nOmaha Nighthawks.\nGrant signed with the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League on September 21, 2010.\nChicago Bears.\nGrant signed with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League on October 5, 2010. He was released on October 19.\nLegal troubles.\nGrant was indicted on a charge of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a February 2008 altercation at a nightclub in which a pregnant woman was shot to death outside a Blakely, Georgia nightclub. Korynda Reed, 23, and her unborn fetus died after being taken to the Southeast Alabama Medical Center in Dothan after the fight early in the morning of February 3, 2008. Grant has said that he was neither an instigator nor a participant in the fight. Grant was arraigned on August 15, 2008. The criminal case was resolved in May 2010 when Grant pleaded guilty to a charge of public affray, he was assessed a $1,000 fine and a year's probation, and ordered to pay $20,000 for the cost of the investigation by the sheriff's office; the more serious involuntary murder charge was dismissed. Grant still faced a civil suit by the family of the victim."

        "title": "Russell Martin (baseball)",
        "text": "Russell Nathan Coltrane Jeanson Martin Jr. (born February 15, 1983) is a Canadian former professional baseball catcher. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Toronto Blue Jays, and is a four-time MLB All-Star. In 2007, Martin won the Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award.\nMartin became the everyday catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers immediately upon his MLB debut in 2006, and continued in that role for nearly five years. His offensive and defensive performance earned wide accolades during his first three years, but they diminished significantly in 2009 and 2010. Martin spent the last two months of 2010 on the disabled list. After the Dodgers declined to offer him arbitration in 2011, he signed with the Yankees and succeeded Jorge Posada as the Yankees' everyday catcher.\nIn November 2012, Martin signed a two-year free agent contract with the Pirates, and took over the team's everyday catcher duties. Following the 2014 season, he signed a five-year, $82 million contract with the Blue Jays. In January 2019, he was traded back to the Dodgers.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues (2002–2006).\nMartin was selected in the 35th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the Montreal Expos, but did not sign. He then attended Chipola College for two years before being chosen in the 17th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Drafted as a third baseman, Martin played his first professional season with the Gulf Coast Dodgers, and hit .286 with 10 RBI in 41 games. In the offseason, he was converted to a catcher. Martin played the 2003 minor league season with the Ogden Raptors, and was later promoted to the Class-A South Georgia Waves. In 77 combined games, he batted .276 with 9 home runs and 50 RBI.\nMartin was a Florida State League All-Star catcher while with the Vero Beach Dodgers in 2004, playing 122 games and batting .250 with 15 home runs and 64 RBI. During the offseason, Martin played with the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League. In 2005, he played in a career-high 129 games for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns and made the All-Star team, hitting .311 with 9 home runs and 61 RBI. Martin began the 2006 season with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, where he hit .297 in 23 games before his promotion.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2006–2010).\nMartin was promoted to the Dodgers on May 5, 2006, after a wrist injury to starting catcher Dioner Navarro. He got two hits, including a double, in the game. His first hit was against Chris Capuano. On May 7, he hit his first major league home run against Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Dave Bush. On June 6, 2006, Martin and Éric Gagné made baseball history by becoming the first French Canadian battery in the majors. Martin's play was good enough that, on June 26, 2006, Navarro was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 13, 2006, Martin hit his first career walk-off home run in a victory that completed a sweep of the rival San Francisco Giants. On September 18, 2006, Martin hit a solo home run off of Trevor Hoffman, the third of four consecutive home runs in the bottom of the 9th inning to tie the San Diego Padres. It was the first time four home runs had been hit in a row since the 1964 Minnesota Twins.\nOn April 21, 2007, Martin hit a walk-off grand slam against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Shawn Chacón in the bottom of the 10th inning. This was the first grand slam of his career.\nIn May 2007, Martin broke the Dodgers' franchise record for single-season steals by a catcher (12) set by John Roseboro in 1962. On July 1, it was announced that Martin finished in first place in All-Star Game voting, leading Paul Lo Duca by 296,948 votes. He became the first ever Canadian born catcher to start the All-Star Game.\nAt the end of the 2007 season, he was awarded with the National League Gold Glove Award and the Silver Slugger Award.\nOn May 2, 2008, Martin started his first game at third base since reaching the Majors, allowing veteran backup Gary Bennett to spell Martin behind the plate. Martin made his second all-star game during the 2008 season. He caught 10 innings of a 15 inning game in which the American League won 4–3. Martin's 10 innings caught are tied for fourth place all time among all star catchers in a single game.\nOn January 20, 2009, Martin signed a one-year, $3.9 million contract to avoid salary arbitration. The deal was the largest ever awarded to a catcher in his first year of arbitration. He played for the Canadian team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic and then rejoined the Dodgers. He slumped offensively in 2009, hitting only .250 with 7 home runs in 143 games, the weakest totals in his four-year career.\nIn 2010, Martin continued to regress as he hit .248 with 5 home runs and 26 RBI in 97 games. In August, Martin suffered a torn labrum in his right hip when he was trying to avoid a tag at home plate in a game against the Padres. The injury kept him sidelined for the rest of the season.\nDue to his uncertain recovery from injury and declining production, and concern that Martin would be awarded a salary as high as $6 million in arbitration, the Dodgers did not tender Martin a contract for 2011 and allowed him to become a free agent. The Dodgers offered Martin a one-year contract worth $4.2 million prior to the arbitration hearings but he insisted on receiving well above $5 million. After Martin rebuffed the Dodgers' offer, the Dodgers non-tendered him and signed journeyman catcher Rod Barajas, though hinting that Martin could still have a place on the team. Martin said the Dodgers had shown by avoiding arbitration that they no longer \"believed in\" him.\nNew York Yankees (2011–2012).\nMartin agreed to a $6 million guaranteed one-year contract with the New York Yankees for the 2011 season. The value of the contract could reach $9.4 million if he caught 110 games.\nMartin began the 2011 season as the everyday catcher for the Yankees. He was elected to the 2011 American League All-Star team as a Yankee.\nAlong with Robinson Canó and Curtis Granderson, Martin was one of the Yankees' three batters who hit an MLB record three grand slams in a single game in a 22–9 rout of the Oakland Athletics at Yankee Stadium on August 25, 2011.\nAs a Super Two player, Martin was eligible for arbitration for a fourth time, and he signed a one-year, $7.5 million contract for the 2012 season with up to $100,000 in performance bonuses with the Yankees to avoid arbitration on January 24. He spent the year as the starting catcher with Chris Stewart as his backup. In 133 games, he hit .211 with 21 home runs and 53 RBI. Martin started all 9 games of the Yankees' postseason, going 5-for-31 with one home run.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2013–2014).\nOn November 29, 2012, Ken Rosenthal reported that the Pittsburgh Pirates had signed Martin for two years and $17 million. The deal became official on November 30. On June 4, 2013, Martin made his first start and appearance at right field. On June 8, 2013, Martin hit his 100th career home run.\nIn the NL Wild Card Game on October 1, 2013, Martin hit a pair of solo home runs as the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-2. The first was off Reds starter Johnny Cueto. Cueto, . His next pitch, a fastball over the heart of the plate, was crushed into the left-field stands by Martin. This home run gave the Pirates the momentum to win the game, their first postseason victory in 21 years.\nDuring a game against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 20, 2014, Martin was involved in a brawl which was started when Carlos Gómez hit a triple off Gerrit Cole after which Martin was suspended 2 games by the MLB on April 22, 2014, for his role in the brawl.\nToronto Blue Jays (2015–2018).\nOn November 18, 2014, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that they had signed Martin to a five-year, $82 million contract. Early in spring training, manager John Gibbons told reporters that Martin would be R. A. Dickey's catcher during practice and in preseason games, to give him the opportunity to practice catching Dickey's knuckleball. Martin received a standing ovation from the fans at Olympic Stadium on April 3, as the Blue Jays played their final two spring training games in Montreal for the second consecutive year. On April 19, 2015, Martin caught Jeff Francis in his debut for the Blue Jays, and in doing so formed the first all-Canadian battery in franchise history. On June 2, Martin stole home off the back end of a double steal, and became the first Blue Jay to steal home since Brett Lawrie did so in 2012. Martin established a new career-high in home runs on September 26, hitting his 22nd of the season to aid the Blue Jays to a 10–8 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. He ended the 2015 regular season with a .240 batting average, 23 home runs, and 77 RBI in 129 games. He led the major leagues in passed balls, with 19. Martin was announced as a finalist for the catcher Gold Glove award, along with Salvador Pérez and Jason Castro.\nMartin appeared in 137 games for the Blue Jays in 2016, and hit .231 with 20 home runs and 74 RBI. He struggled in the postseason, recording only three hits in 33 at-bats.\nOn April 29, 2017, Martin became the 15th catcher to record 10,000 career putouts at the position.\nOn June 20, 2018, Martin became the 11th catcher to make 11,000 career putouts at the position. Martin endured his worst offensive season of his career, hitting .194 with 10 home runs and 25 RBIs. In the final game of the 2018 season, Martin managed the Blue Jays, the team wound up losing in his managerial debut.\nReturn to the Dodgers (2019).\nOn January 11, 2019, the Blue Jays traded Martin to the Dodgers for prospects Ronny Brito and Andrew Sopko. The Blue Jays also sent $16.4 million to offset most of Martin's $20 million salary. Martin spent the 2019 season as the Dodgers' backup catcher, first behind Austin Barnes and then Will Smith.\nOn March 30, 2019, Martin pitched the top of the ninth inning in the Dodgers' 18-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He made ten pitches and retired three straight batters, becoming the first major league position player to pitch and complete the ninth inning of a game that his team won since left fielder Willie Smith did so for the Detroit Tigers on September 23, 1963. Martin also became the first position player to pitch a 1-2-3 ninth inning in a team win since at least 1925. On August 28, 2019, Martin became the first position player to pitch in a shutout victory since October 3, 1917, when George Kelly of the New York Giants did so. In what would be his last season in the majors, Martin played in 83 games for the Dodgers in 2019, hitting .220 with six homers and 20 RBI.\nRetirement.\nOn May 28, 2022, he announced his retirement, via an Instagram post.\nInternational career.\nMartin was first selected to play for Canada during the 2009 World Baseball Classic.\nIn an effort to quit the use of chewing tobacco in 2009, Martin began wearing a custom-fitted mouthpiece during the WBC and Spring training.\nMartin hoped to switch to shortstop during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, citing he did not want to learn another pitching staff during the tournament because he was already learning a new staff in Pittsburgh. Martin had played third base in the minors before becoming a catcher. Martin would later withdraw his name, citing soreness.\nOn December 5, 2016, Martin committed to play shortstop for Team Canada at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. However, Martin was left off Team Canada's WBC roster on February 8, 2017, due to insurance complications relating to his offseason minor knee surgery.\nPersonal life.\nMartin was born in Toronto, Ontario, and spent his early childhood in Montreal and Chelsea, Quebec. After he had become successful as a professional ballplayer, his childhood ballpark in Chelsea was refurbished and named after him. Along with playing baseball in the Montreal neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Martin played hockey for N.D.G. Minor Hockey. He graduated from Polyvalente Édouard-Montpetit High School. After graduating from high school, Martin took a junior college scholarship at Chipola College in Marianna, Florida, United States.\nMartin is biracial: his father, Russell Martin Sr., is Black Canadian, while his mother, Suzanne Jeanson, is Franco-Manitoban. His full name is Russell Nathan Coltrane Jeanson Martin Jr. He was named Russell for his father, Nathan for a great-grandfather, Jeanson after his mother's family, and Coltrane to pay homage to musician John Coltrane, who his father admired. Martin's parents separated when Martin was two years old. His father used to play saxophone in Montreal metro stations to help pay for his son's baseball training. Martin Sr. played \"O Canada\" on his saxophone before a 2015 spring training game.\nWhen Martin was nine years old, his mother remarried. She moved to Paris, France, with her new husband and daughter. Russell Jr. would split his time living between his mother in Paris and his father in Montreal for a year. Martin changed the name printed on his jersey to \"J. Martin\" for the 2009 season in reference to \"Jeanson\", in honour of his mother."

        "text": "Paul Joseph Martin (born March 5, 1981) is an American former ice hockey defenseman. He was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the second round, 62nd overall, of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, playing six seasons for the organization before joining the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2010 and later the San Jose Sharks in 2015.\nPlaying career.\nHigh school/collegiate.\nMartin played high school hockey at Elk River High School and was the Mr. Hockey award winner. In 2000, he was drafted in the second round, 62nd overall, by the New Jersey Devils. He has sound offensive instincts and a projectable frame, and is a classic stay at home defenseman. He was part of a successful program at the University of Minnesota in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). He helped his school win the 2002 and 2003 NCAA Division I National Championships.\nProfessional.\nMartin joined the Devils for the 2003–04 season, playing 70 games in his first full season, putting up 24 points. The next season, Martin played for Fribourg-Gottéron in Switzerland due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. He returned the next season, this time appearing in 80 games while increasing his point production to 37.\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Martin played the entire 82-game season, though his point total dropped to 26. During the 2009–10 season, Martin suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left forearm, playing in just 22 games and scoring a career-low 11 points.\nMartin signed a five-year, US$25 million contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins as an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2010. He made his Penguins regular season debut on October 7, 2010, against the Philadelphia Flyers, picking up the primary assist on Tyler Kennedy's third period goal, the Penguins' first ever at the Consol Energy Center. He returned to New Jersey to face his former team for the first time on October 11, and finished the game with a goal, an assist and over 26 minutes of ice time in a 3–1 Penguins victory.\nMartin scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal with the Penguins on April 13, 2012, against the Philadelphia Flyers in an 8–5 Penguins loss. He was scratched with an undisclosed injury for Game 4.\nOn July 1, 2015, Martin was signed as a free agent to a four-year, $19.4 million deal with the San Jose Sharks. He lost to his former team, the Penguins, in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals. On January 16, 2018, the Sharks assigned Martin to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the San Jose Barracuda.\nOn June 22, 2018, the Sharks placed Martin on unconditional waivers for purpose of a buyout. He cleared waivers on June 23, 2018.\nHe announced his retirement on November 14, 2018.\nInternational play.\nMartin was named to Team USA for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and again for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, along with then-Devils teammates Zach Parise and Jamie Langenbrunner. Martin, however, did not see any action in the 2006 Winter Olympics, and missed the 2010 Winter Olympics due to a broken arm; he was replaced in the latter tournament by Tim Gleason.\nMartin was also named to Team USA for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where the U.S. failed to medal.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2017, Martin launched the Shine A Ligh7 Foundation, a non-profit organization that distributes funds to qualified non-profit organizations who raise awareness and reduce the stigma for those affected by bullying, depression, and mental health issues."

He started his professional career that same year in A-ball. Over the years, he found his niche as a relief pitcher, posting minor league ERAs as low as 1.42 and 1.77.\nBy the time he made his Major League debut at age 25 in 2002 with the St. Louis Cardinals (the Giants traded him earlier that year for Jason Christiansen), he was already a veteran minor leaguer. He had a very small chance to prove he was major league worthy, only appearing in 11 games that year. Joseph was quickly sent to the minors, where he spent one more season. In his final season, he made two stops in the minors, each winning only one game with each team."

In 2003 another six members were added to the elite club, with six more added in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2007 there were three more inductees: three from pre-1940 and three from post World War II.\nThere were thirty-five members of the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame up to the end of 2007.\nIn 2018 the ARL took control of the concept of The Immortals, an accolade till that point administered by Rugby League Week. The ARL clarified the protocols of Immortal induction and the interplay with the Hall of Fame. It was confirmed that Immortals would continue to be inducted rarely &amp; occasionally and would be selected from the overall pool of the Rugby League Hall of Fame. Inductees for the Hall of Fame would occur regularly - perhaps every year - with six new inductees in 2018. It was also confirmed that the 65 members of the NRL's Team of the Century (selected during the 2008 century celebrations) who were not in the Hall of Fame as at 2007, were all to be entered to the Hall of Fame. Effectively 65 players who had been selected for honour in 2008 were added to the Hall of Fame in March 2018; with a further new 6 added in July 2018. "

        "title": "1981 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1981 Tour de France was the 68th edition of the Tour de France, taking place between 25 June and 19 July. The total race distance was 24 stages over . It was dominated by Bernard Hinault, who led the race from the sixth stage on, increasing his lead almost every stage. Only Phil Anderson was able to stay close to him, until the 16th stage when he fell behind by about 7:00, and then on the 17th stage he would lose another 17 minutes. In the end only Lucien Van Impe, Robert Alban and Joop Zoetemelk were able to finish inside 20:00 of the now three time champ.\nThe points classification was won by Freddy Maertens, who did so by winning five stages. The mountains classification was won by Lucien Van Impe, Peter Winnen won the young rider classification, and the Peugeot team won the team classification.\nTeams.\nLate 1980, there were plans to make the tour \"open\", which meant that amateur teams would also be allowed to join. This would make it possible for teams from Eastern Europe to join. The plan did not materialize, so only professional teams were invited. In January 1981, the organisation decided that there would be 15 teams with 10 cyclists, or 16 teams with 9 cyclists each. At that point, 16 teams had already submitted a request to join, and the organisation was in discussion with four additional Italian teams, and the American national team. In the end, the American team did not apply, and the Italian teams decided to focus on the 1981 Giro d'Italia. The organisation selected 15 teams, who each selected 10 cyclists, for a total of 150 participants.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nBernard Hinault, the winner of the 1978 and 1979 Tour de France and reigning world champion, was the main favourite. His knee problems, that caused him to leave the 1980 Tour de France, were solved, and he was in form: Hinault had won important races in the spring, and he had skipped the 1981 Giro d'Italia to focus on the Tour.\nHis main rivals were 1980 Tour de France winner Joop Zoetemelk, 1976 Tour de France winner Lucien Van Impe and Joaquim Agostinho, although they had never been able to beat Hinault when he was in form, and of these rivals only Zoetemelk was ever able to keep Hinault within striking distance.\nFreddy Maertens, the winner of the points classification in the Tour de France in 1976 and 1978, had won only three minor races in 1979 and 1980, but in 1981 he was selected again for the Tour.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1981 Tour de France was revealed in December 1980. Originally, the thirteenth stage was planned as a time trial, followed by a transfer of more than 500 km on the same day, with the fourteenth stage the next day as a mountain stage. A few months before the Tour, there were many teams interested in the Tour, and the Tour organisation was afraid that there would not be enough time on 9 July to have the time trial for that many cyclists, followed by the transfer. For this reason, the thirteenth stage was changed into a criterium, and the fourteenth stage became the time trial. The 1981 Tour de France started on 25 June, and had two rest days, in Nantes and Morzine. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de la Madeleine mountain pass on stage 19.\nRace overview.\nHinault started out strong and won the prologue. Freddy Maertens showed he was still able to win sprints by winning the first part of the first stage. The second part was a team time trial, won by TI–Raleigh, which put Gerrie Knetemann in the lead of the race. TI–Raleigh also won the second team time trial in stage four.\nThe Pyrenees were only briefly visited, in the fifth stage. For the last mountain, Hinault was the lead group, together with Lucien Van Impe and Phil Anderson. Van Impe escaped in the last kilometres and won the stage, 27 seconds ahead of Hinault. Anderson, who finished in third place, became the new leader, the first Australian cyclist to wear the yellow jersey. Anderson had started as domestique for Jean-René Bernaudeau, and nobody was expecting him to be able to follow Hinault. In the time trial of stage six, Hinault won as expected, and became the race leader. Anderson surprised with a third place, and he now followed Hinault by 13 seconds in the general classification.\nIn the following stages, through Northern France and Belgium, Hinault slowly increased his margin over Anderson by winning amelioration sprints, until leading by 57 seconds after stage 13. In stage 14, Hinault won the time trial, and added two more minutes to the margin.\nIn the sixteenth stage in the Alps, Anderson was not able to follow anymore. He lost 4 minutes to Hinault, but stayed in second place. Anderson lost this second place in the 17th stage, where he lost 17 minutes, making Van Impe the new second placed cyclist, nine minutes behind. Hinault showed his dominance by winning the eighteenth stage.\nThe time trial in stage 20 was also won by Hinault, who increased the margin to Van Impe to more than 14 minutes.\nDoping.\nIn the 16th stage, Claude Vincendeau was randomly selected to undergo a doping test. Vincendeau abandoned during that stage, and had already left to his hotel. One of the doctors then went to his hotel to obtain a urine sample, but Vincendeau was unable/unwanting to give it. This counted as a positive test.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1981 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. The time bonus for stage winners had been absent in the years before, but it returned in 1981; 30, 20 and 10 seconds for the first three cyclists in every stage.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, were cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only cyclists younger than 24 were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1981, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Bernard Hinault won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point in the Landes forest before the end of stage 7 in Bordeaux. This prize was won by Theo de Rooij.\nAftermath.\nThe 1981 Tour de France is seen as the year in which the globalization of the Tour became important. Before that most cyclists came from France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, with only occasional successes by other European cyclists. Anderson was the first non-European cyclist to lead the Tour de France, and more would follow in the coming years. The plans to make the Tour de France open to amateurs were not forgotten, and it happened in 1983.\nAnderson would again wear the yellow jersey in the next year, when he also won the young rider classification.\nHinault won five stages as reigning world champion. This had happened before, most recently in 1979 with Gerrie Knetemann and in 1980 with Jan Raas, but after 1981 it became a rare occurrence. The next time that this happened was in 2002 with Óscar Freire, and after that in 2011 with Thor Hushovd.\nMaertens who also won five stages would make his comeback year complete by winning the 1981 UCI Road World Championships later that year, but after that never reached his 1981 level again.\nJacques Boyer became the first American to ride in the Tour de France, acting as a domestique for Hinault."

        "title": "Cincinnati Tennis Club",
        "text": "The Cincinnati Tennis Club was founded in 1880 just five years after tennis was introduced in America, and is today one of the oldest active tennis clubs in the United States.\nHistory.\nStewart Shillito, the son of John Shillito, the founder of the Cincinnati department store, Shillito's, had seen tennis played while on vacation at the fashionable seaside resort of Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, and in 1878 he decided to build a court at his father's home on Highland Avenue and Oak Street in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Mt. Auburn.\nAfter the first court was built, interest spread rapidly among enthusiastic friends of Shillito, and by 1880, Cincinnati was ready for a tennis club.\nOn December 3, 1880, Edmund H. Pendleton presided over a meeting held at the Burnet House in Cincinnati, the purpose being the organization of a tennis club. A constitution was drawn up and the following officers were nominated and elected: President - Jeptha Garrand; Secretary - Howard S. Winslow; and Treasurer - Albert C. Barney.\nIn one week, 86 players were enrolled as members, and the south wing of Music Hall was leased for indoor play until May 1881, making Cincinnati the site of some of the earliest indoor play in America. The lease on Music Hall was renewed for an additional year, but soon thereafter the decision was made to terminate the agreement. (The story is that the roof leaked, and the club members wanted a discount on the rent because of it.) With the termination of the lease, the era of the nineteenth century indoor tennis ended in Cincinnati.\nAt the time one of the officers of the club, Howard S. Winslow, lived on Oak Street and Reading Road. His father generously made available to the members if the club (CTC) sufficient ground to lay three grass courts at the rear of his property which was adjacent to a lane. The city fathers, seeing growing tennis activity, named the lane Tennis Lane. It continues to bear that name today.\nThe CTC remained at that location through 1885, when it moved, with no explanation, to a new location on Arbigust Street (now called Vernon Place).\nFor the next 13 years the Club occupied two different locations on Vernon Place. During these years the Club grew in terms of membership and activity, and in two of the three years, 1891 and 1893, the club sponsored the Ohio State Adult Championship. Having moved twice in 13 years, the club began looking in 1898 for a more permanent address.\nAmong the members of CTC were John B. Keys and John Scarborough. Each owned tracts of land which they were interested in developing into a subdivision. They both hoped to do the club a favor, and at the same time enhance the value of their holdings by encouraging the club to locate on their property. John Keys offered as a gift of land on Bedford Avenue adjoining the new Cincinnati Golf Club. John Scarborough offered the Club what is substantially its present location, not as a gift, but rent free for the first few years. Mr. Scarborough agreed to lay out four courts and build a club house at his own expense.\nFinally in the spring of 1899, Scarborough's offer was excepted because Keys' property on Bedford was considered \"too far out in the country and somewhat inaccessible\".\nThirty-eight members from Vernon Place along with many new members brought the membership to 186 when the courts were opened. Some of the improvements promised in the Scarborough agreements were not completed until 1900.\nIn the first year at the new location there were four courts, the present courts 1, 2, 9 and 10. In 1904 three more courts were added to the upper tier, the present 6, 7 and 8. In 1925 three courts were added to the lower tier, courts 3, 4 and 5. The original club house was torn down in 1905 and replaced with the present structure in 1906.\nThe Tri-State Tournament.\nBetween the years of 1903 and 1968, and with the exception of about 10 years, the Club hosted the popular and well-known tournament known as the Tri-State Tennis Tournament. This event attracted many of the best male and female players from around the country and the world, and the tournament was always one of the major events on the major tennis schedule during the Pre-Open Era.\nIn 1904 \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" reported: \"Such a number of noted tennis players from cities throughout the United States has been entered that the Tri-State Tournament ranks very high, being surpassed in importance only by the National Lawn Tennis Association Tournament at Newport, R.I.\"\nMany great players, both men and women, participated in the tournament. Its list of winners reads like a \"Who's Who'\" of tennis - Nat Emerson, Beals Wright, Bill Tilden, George Lott, Bobby Riggs, Frank Parker, Bill Talbert, Tony Trabert, Barry MacKay, May Sutton, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz, and Dorothy Bundy, to name but a few.\nThis tournament eventually would grow into what is now known as the Western &amp; Southern Open. The tournament, now held in the Cincinnati suburb of Mason, is the oldest tournament in the nation played in its original city.\nNat Emerson and Tony Trabert.\nThe club has had a number of nationally ranked players, the first being Nat Emerson who won the Tri-State Tournament when it was first played in 1899, and was a finalist several times afterward. He was ranked No. 7 in Men's Singles by the USTA in 1908. Another nationally prominent player in the early years was Reuben A. Holden Jr., who won the NCAA Singles Championship in 1910 while a student at Yale University. It was 41 years later in 1951, when Club member Tony Trabert playing for the University of Cincinnati won the NCAA Singles title. Barry MacKay of Dayton also won the NCAA Singles title in 1957, while at the University of Michigan.\nTrabert was one of the most prominent players in the modern history of tennis. He played on the United States Davis Cup team and was later the captain. He won the French singles twice, 1954-55 as well as the Wimbledon and U.S. singles in 1955, making him one of only nine men in tennis history to have won three of the four major titles in a calendar year. He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1970. Court 2 at the tennis club has been dedicated in his honor.\nBill Talbert was ranked in the U.S. Top 10 13 times between 1941 &amp; 1954. He won nine Grand Slam doubles titles, and also reached the men's doubles finals of the U.S. National Championship nine times. He also was a Davis Cup player and one of the most successful Davis Cup captains in U.S. history. He was enshrined into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1967 and was in the first class, along with his former protégé Tony Trabert, enshrined into the Cincinnati Tennis Hall of Fame. After his playing career, he was Tournament Director of the US Open. Talbert and Trabert were both coached by Howard Zaeh, as well as many hundreds of others who went on to play around the world.\nDavis Cup.\nThroughout this long period the Club continued to bring world class players and teams to Cincinnati, including a Davis Cup tie in 1952, the first ever to be played here. All this activity did much to further the interest in tennis in Cincinnati and in the Ohio Valley area.\nProminent members.\nIn addition to a number of outstanding players, CTC has had distinguished and prominent citizens in its membership. To name a few, William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States and later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; Potter Stewart, Justice of the Supreme court; Neil McElroy, Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration and President and Chairman of the Procter &amp; Gamble Company. Too numerous to mention are other members who have been leaders in the business community, medical, legal and teaching professions. From 1993 to 1995, member J. Howard \"Bumpy\" Frazer served as president of the USTA - the first Cincinnatian ever to direct the national organization. Another member, Alvin Bunis, founded the first tennis senior tour—the first senior tour in either tennis or golf.\nNational Register of Historic Places.\nCTC has occupied its present site at Dexter and Wold Avenues since 1899, and on March 29, 1983 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of Interior for its leadership in the development and advancement of the sport of tennis in the Cincinnati and Ohio Valley Area.\nNational Father Son Clay Court Championships.\nSince 1974, the club has played host to the United States Tennis Association's National Father &amp; Son Clay Court Championships."

        "title": "2007 World Championships in Athletics",
        "text": "The 11th World Championships in Athletics, () under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), were held at Nagai Stadium in Osaka, Japan from 24 August to 2 September 2007. 200 of the IAAF's 212 member federations entered a total of 1,978 athletes, the greatest number of competitors at any World Championships to date. Sarah Brightman, the world's best-selling soprano, performed her single \"Running\" at the opening ceremony.\nBidding process.\nHaving bid unsuccessfully to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, Osaka was one of three cities to express an interest in hosting the 2007 World Championships alongside Budapest, Hungary and Berlin, Germany. By the IAAF's October 1, 2002 deadline, Budapest and Berlin had both withdrawn their bids, and Osaka was announced as the host city on November 15, 2002, as the sole remaining candidate. Berlin later bid successfully for the 2009 World Championships.\nMajor themes.\nDoping concerns.\nThe IAAF stepped up its \"war on doping\" at the Osaka games, and for the first time, the number of drug tests exceeded 1,000. The IAAF lobbied the World Anti-Doping Agency to adopt stiffer penalties for first-time doping offences in WADA's code of practice. Before the Championships, former Olympic champion Ed Moses had voiced concerns about the extent of doping in the sport, and had even predicted that a medallist at the event would be found to have taken a banned substance. Despite these fears, the IAAF announced that only one of the samples taken over the course of the Championships was \"suspicious\" and required more examination. The governing body refused to elaborate further until more was known, but the French hurdler Naman Keïta admitted to having failed a drug test. The IAAF later confirmed that Keïta had tested positive for testosterone in an out-of-competition test at a training camp, and labelled the World Championships 'drug-free'.\nWeather conditions.\nThe Championships were held during an unseasonably hot summer in Japan, in contrast to the cool, wet and windy conditions of Helsinki two years earlier. Temperatures earlier in the month had reached 40 °C (104 °F), killing several people. Temperatures had eased somewhat by the start of the event, but with early-morning temperatures around 30 °C and humidity high, the IAAF maintained a colour-coded advisory scale warning of the risk of heat stroke. Casualties of the heat were not as high as initially feared, but dozens of athletes failed to finish the walks and marathons and a few did require medical treatment. Some athletes in shorter events blamed poor performances on the difficult conditions.\nAttendance.\nConcerns had been raised in the week running up to the Championships about the low level of ticket sales – only 46% of seats had been filled by August 20. The Nagai Stadium was less than half full for the opening ceremony, and there were around 15,000 empty seats on the night of the men's 100 m final. A number of reasons were cited for the poor attendance, including high ticket prices (especially since the streets were lined during the marathons), the hot weather and the disappointing performance of the Japanese team. IAAF vice-president Sebastian Coe also suggested that the length of the Championships may have to be shortened in future to sustain the public's interest.\nNotable performances.\nDespite no world records being broken, the Championships saw a number of significant personal and team achievements. The United States dominated the overall standings ahead of Kenya and Russia, equalling its best ever medal haul (first achieved in 1991) with 26, fourteen of them golds. The U.S. also set another Championship first by triumphing in all four relay races. These accomplishments were highlighted by three individual performances: Tyson Gay and Allyson Felix collected three gold medals each (Gay in the 100 and 200 metres and the 4 × 100 m relay, Felix in the 200 m and the two women's relays), a feat previously achieved only by Marita Koch, Carl Lewis and Maurice Greene; while Kenyan-born Bernard Lagat became the first man to win both the 1500 and 5000 m titles at the same World Championships. Perhaps the most unlikely American medal came from 110 m hurdler David Payne, who as first alternate had not travelled to Osaka with the rest of the team. After Dominique Arnold withdrew from the event with an injury, Payne only arrived in Japan the night before the heats, and proceeded to move through the rounds before taking bronze with a personal best.\nAmongst prominent European successes were Swede Carolina Klüft's third consecutive world heptathlon title with a European record score, the victory of 39-year-old German Franka Dietzsch in the discus, which made her the second-oldest world champion ever and Nelson Évora's win in the triple jump, beating world-leading Brazilian Jadel Gregorio and defending champion Walter Davis. Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain and Northern Ireland claimed a surprise gold in the women's 400 metres, less than a month after the expiry of a year-long ban imposed for missing three drug tests, while high jumper Kyriakos Ioannou claimed the first ever medal for Cyprus in a World Championships. Russia's Tatyana Lebedeva just missed out on an unprecedented long jump/triple jump double, but still ended up with a gold and a silver medal.\nAfrican countries were typically well represented in the middle and long-distance events, with Kenyans claiming both the men's and women's marathon titles and Ethiopia winning three golds.\nChinese athlete Liu Xiang, the only sprinter of non-African origin to clock sub-13 second 110m hurdles, took the gold medal at this event with a time of 12.95 seconds.\nWorld Record Holders for the 20 km Walk, Jefferson Pérez, and 50 km Walk, Nathan Deakes, both won their respective events, confirming their dominance of the event. In Perez's case, this was his third World Championship Gold Medal in a row.\nHost nation Japan gained its only medal on the final day with a bronze for Reiko Tosa in the women's marathon.\nMen's results.\nTrack.\n2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011\nNote: * Indicates athletes who ran in preliminary rounds.\nField.\n2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011\nWomen's results.\nTrack.\n2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011\nNote: * Indicates athletes who ran in preliminary rounds.\nField.\n2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011\nBroadcasting.\nThe broadcasters of the 2007 IAAF World Championships were as follows:\nWorldwide.\nThis list is non-exhaustive."

        "text": "The 12th IAAF World Championships in Athletics () were held in Berlin, Germany from 15 to 23 August 2009. The majority of events took place in the Olympiastadion, while the marathon and racewalking events started and finished at the Brandenburg Gate.\nOrganization.\nBidding process.\nBerlin was announced the winning bidder by the IAAF on 6 December 2004 beating out bids from Split (Croatia), Valencia (Spain), Brisbane (Australia), Brussels (Belgium), Delhi (India), Casablanca (Morocco) and Daegu (South Korea). The city of Berlin and the Deutscher Leichtathletik-Verband (German Athletics Association) are responsible for the organisation of the event. The Berlin Organising Committee 2009 GmbH, a corporation established by the DLV in 2005, will supervise the operative organisation of the competition.\nCosts.\nBuilding upon Germany's history of successful athletics events, including the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, the 1936 and 1972 Summer Olympics, IAAF president Lamine Diack was confident of a well organised competition. The organizers announced a budget of €49.8 million to stage the event, which includes the travel and accommodation costs for all participating athletes. Revenues include €17 million from ticketing and €7 million from marketing. The city of Berlin will cover a deficit up to €20 million. The organising committee secured 9000 rooms in the city to account for accommodation, with the hope that the booking of the Hotel Estrel (950 rooms) and Hotel Berlin (650 rooms) for athletes would create an atmosphere similar to an Olympic Village.\nOverall, the event was an economic success for the capital. A total of 417,156 tickets were sold over the nine-day period, and estimates placed the total visitor spend in the city at around €120 million. As a result, Berlin's mayor, Klaus Wowereit, stated that the city would consider applying to host another athletics event in the future, such as the 2016 European Athletics Championships.\nMedia and marketing.\nA limited edition €10 coin was produced for the event by the German government, which was only the third occasion that they had done so for a sporting event. The organising committee held a contest to decide the name of its mascot, a running anthropomorphic bear, and the name \"Berlino\" was chosen. The colour scheme of the event, including the official logo, advertising, and the Olympiastadion's track and field, was blue and green. The committee stated that blue represented reliability while green represented the event's environmental ambitions. The event featured a number of environmentally friendly initiatives, including: free public transport with every ticket sold, efforts to reduce energy usage, considerations for waste and recycling management, and environmentally conscious construction and building management. Furthermore, as part of the United Nations Environment Programme, forty-seven trees (one for each athletics event) were planted to create an \"Avenue of Champions\" in Berlin. The official song for the event was \"Foot of the Mountain\" by Norwegian group A-ha.\nThe broadcasting rights for the Championships were sold to 213 countries, a new high for the event. ARD and ZDF were the host broadcasting TV networks and producers of the TV signal, and they founded a company named BERTA which provided the signal in high-resolution HDTV for TV stations around the world. The average viewing figures in Germany were 5 million with peaks of 9.9 and 8.6 million for the men's 100 metres final and the women's high jump, respectively. The average audience figures in France were 3.5–4 million, 2.5–3.5 million in the United Kingdom and 4–5 million in Japan. The IAAF website received a record number of page hits and unique users: having around 1 million unique users accessing the website on days five and six, and a total of over 90 million page views over the course of the nine days of the competition. Around 3500 media representatives were estimated to have attended the event.\nTo provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the event, the local organizers also conducted a Champions Run 10K on 22 August between the scheduled time for the men's and women's marathons, using a portion of the official marathon course which passes various Berlin landmarks with a finish at the Brandenburg Gate. The field was limited to 10,000 runners.\nVenues.\nThe Championships were staged in the 74,845-seat Olympiastadion, which underwent a €242 million renovation ahead of the 2006 Football World Cup. The marathon races, as well as the racewalking events, had their start and finish at the Brandenburg Gate, with the race walks routed along the Unter den Linden boulevard and the marathon passing through Pariser Platz and going past Berlin's other points of interest. An estimated 400,000 tickets were sold by the event organisers for the event.\nIn memory of their historic Olympic achievements at the Olympiastadion in 1936, a meeting took place between the families of Luz Long and Jesse Owens. Long's long jump advice to rival Owens remains a prominent example of sportsmanship and friendship in athletics. A reward of US$100,000 was given to any athlete who broke a world record at the competition.\nAnti-doping program.\nThe event featured one of the most comprehensive anti-doping initiatives ever undertaken by the IAAF. A total of 1000 samples were collected from athletes and tested at labs accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and additional educational anti-doping activities were available. Diack stressed that samples are retained for future analysis, thus currently undetectable drugs could be tested for in the future, preventing athletes from flouting the anti-doping rules.\nTwo athletes failed anti-doping tests during the championships: Moroccan steeplechaser Jamel Chatbi tested positive for the stimulant clenbuterol and Nigerian hurdler Amaka Ogoegbunam was found to have Metenolone, an anabolic steroid, in her sample. Another Nigerian hurdler, Olutoyin Augustus, was banned from the championships for having abnormal levels of testosterone.\nMen's results.\nTrack.\n1983 | 1987 | 1991 | 1993 | 1995 | 1997 | 1999 | 2001 | 2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013 | 2015 | 2017\nField.\n1983 | 1987 | 1991 | 1993 | 1995 | 1997 | 1999 | 2001 | 2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013 | 2015 | 2017\nWomen's results.\nTrack.\n1983 | 1987 | 1991 | 1993 | 1995 | 1997 | 1999 | 2001 | 2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013 | 2015 | 2017\nField.\n1983 | 1987 | 1991 | 1993 | 1995 | 1997 | 1999 | 2001 | 2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2009 | 2011 | 2013 | 2015 | 2017 \nHighlights.\nRecords.\nAt the competition, three world records, nine Championship records, eight area records and 57 national records were broken.\nDay 1 (15th).\nValeriy Borchin of Russia won gold in the men's 20 km race walk in a time of 1:18:41, Hao Wang of China won silver and Eder Sanchez of Mexico won bronze.

        "title": "Nike Skateboarding",
        "text": "Nike Skateboarding, primarily known as Nike SB, is the Nike brand for its line of shoes, clothing, and equipment for skateboarding. Nike Skateboarding won the 2020 Webby People’s Voice Award for Best Home/Welcome Page in the category Web.\nHistory.\nIn 1997, Nike commenced production of its own line of skate shoes, but was unable to sell to many specialist skate shops, as the market was already strongly in favour of companies such as DC, Globe, eS Footwear, Emerica, and Vans. Nike was not considered a core skateboarding brand among the skateboarding community and did not receive the necessary level of support.\nIn 2002, Nike introduced the \"SB\" brand. The Nike SB Dunk Low model was released, featuring a padded tongue and collar, along with \"Zoom Air\" insoles; the shoe was more similar to other skate shoe styles than the corporation's previous attempts. After the SB Dunk's mediocre sales, Nike released four other models: The Nike SB Angus, Nike SB FC, Nike SB Delta Force, and Nike SB URL.\nIn 2004, Nike SB signed Paul Rodriguez as a figurehead for the brand and recruited Lewis Marnell as the sole Australian team rider during the same period. In March of that year, Nike released the Nike Dunk SB collection, aimed towards skateboarders in California. The associated shoe designs differed from the previous SB Dunk range in that they were designed specifically for skateboarders. The collection included increased padding, Zoom Air insoles, and enhanced material quality, including triple stitching, a standard for skate shoes.\nIn 2005, Rodriguez released a signature shoe model named the \"Nike SB Paul Rodriguez Zoom Air Low\". That year, one of Nike SB's spokespersons Lance Mountain decided to release the Nike Blazer SB, a version of the Nike Blazer basketball shoe from the early 1970s. It was named the Nike SB Blazer and several new features were added, such as the padded collar and Zoom Air insoles. Mountain previously rode for Adidas and then joined Nike SB in 2007.\nNike SB released its first video \"Nothing But The Truth\" in 2007 and held the premiere at in New York City, U.S. The inaugural video production, directed by Lionel Goldstein, features the Nike SB team, with Marnell in the opening part and Rodriguez's part the conclusion of the video.\nIn 2009, Eric Koston left Lakai Limited Footwear to join Nike and a video featuring the Nike SB amateur team, called \"Debacle\", was released later in the year. In December 2011, the video \"SB Chronicles Vol. 1\" premiered online, while premiere parties and free video showings were held throughout the world. The first volume of a two-part series features Stefan Janoski, Wieger Van Wageningen, Chet Childress, Daniel Shimizu, Youness Amrani, Marnell, Grant Taylor, and Clarke Hassler.\nIn 2012, professional Sean Malto (riding for Girl) left Etnies for Nike SB, shortly after his 2011 street league skateboarding win. Flip rider Luan Oliviera was also added to the team and, in late June 2012, Nike SB announced its collaboration with Levi's and team rider Omar Salazar appeared in the promotional advertisements.\nIn July 2012, Nike Skateboarding opened a private training facility in Downtown Los Angeles, California. Named \"6th and Mill\" due to its location at the intersection of the corresponding street names (E. Sixth and Mill Streets), the facility's official opening coincided with the launch of Rodriguez's sixth signature shoe with the brand. The training facility has featured heavily on The Berrics skateboarding website since its opening, with segments such as \"First Try Fridays\" (with professional skateboarder Theotis Beasley) and \"Text Yo'self Before You Wreck Yo'self\" (with professional skateboarder Chris Roberts) filmed inside the facility.\nThe brand released a preview of Brian Anderson's first signature shoe model, entitled the \"Nike SB Project BA\", in February 2013. The \"Sneaker Report\" website explained that the \"upper appears to be a two-piece construction with ample perforations for breathability.\" As of mid-June 2013, the model has not yet been released.\nA promotional campaign, identified by the hashtag \"#thelegendgrows\", was launched by Nike to coincide with release of Koston's second signature shoe model the \"Eric Koston 2\" in March 2013. An advertisement that included other Nike athletes, such as Tiger Woods, and Koston's Nike SB teammates was filmed and a behind-the-scenes video was also published on the brand's YouTube channel. Koston used the Eric Koston 2 design as a basis for a limited edition golf shoe, named the \"Koston 2 IT\", and a corresponding launch was held in London, UK at the 1948 Stadium store in Shoreditch.\nThe trailer for the video \"SB Chronicles Vol. 2\" was published on the Internet in mid-June 2013. The second volume of the two-part series features Oliveira, Daryl Angel, Donovon Piscopo, Theotis Beasley, Justin Brock, Shane O'Neill, and Ishod Wair. Also in mid-June, Nike SB announced that Fucking Awesome Skateboards' Kevin Bradley and Skate Mental skateboards' Trevor Colden were the latest amateur additions to the team. In August 2013, Nike SB collaborated with Almost and \"TransWorld Skate Boarding\" magazine on a feature for amateur rider Youness Amrani. Entitled \"Marrakesh Express\", the project combined a print article with a video part that was launched on the \"TransWorld\" website on August 9, 2013. Videographer Chris Thiesson accompanied Amrani as he skated and traveled between \"Casablanca and Marrakesh by way of Rabat, Kenitra, and Agadir\" in Morocco. Amrani was born in Morocco, but grew up in Belgium.\nIn early 2014. Amrani was promoted to professional status with his skateboarding deck company Almost, and attained professional status on the Nike SB team afterwards.\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, the Nike SB dunk has had a booming resurgence. Nike SB has had many collaborations over the years on SB Dunk shoes. Some notable 2020 collaborations include StrangeLove, Travis Scott, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Concepts, and Atlas. These collaborations led to the resurgence of the SB Dunk, in both the skateboarding and streetwear community.\nCompetitions.\nIn 2012, following Koston's recruitment as a team rider, a competition entitled \"Mr. Control It All\" was launched to coincide with the release of Koston's inaugural signature shoe model with the brand. Koston hosted the competition, alongside fellow team members, Sean Malto and Justin Brock, and it consisted of numerous missions, or challenges. For example, in \"Mission 1\", a different trick was performed by all three skateboarders and entrants were required to send in their edited footage in which they perform the same set of tricks. The entire competition was conducted on the internet, on sites such as YouTube, The Berrics and Nike's own skateboarding site.\nSpecial editions.\nIn addition to yearly releases, a variety of special edition Nike Dunk SBs have been released. The Nike Dunk SB Low Pro SB Tiffany was released in 2005 and, according to the \"Complex Sneakers\" website, was one of the brand's first designs to \"drive nearly everyone crazy.\" The Nike Dunk SB Tiffany design was also adapted by Nick Tershay, as part of Diamond, his skateboard/streetwear company. Other variations and collaborative releases with popular clothing brands made Nike SB popularity intensify. Brands like Stüssy, Supreme New York, Staple Design, and Concepts all developed their own version of the Nike SB Dunk that became highly desired. The Nike Dunk SB Low Staple \"NYC Pigeon\" was also initially released in 2005 by Staple Design. The shoe made headlines of the New York Post because of a riot that started over the shoe and its release. On an interview with Jeff Staple owner of Staple Design, he stated \"They were pulling kids off the gate and arresting them, and kids are holding onto the gate not letting go. Then it turned into a soccer match. Cops called higher level police, like SWAT, and some of the people who came to wait in line brought their own weapons. We saw machetes and baseball bats on the ground. It was crazy. It was just go to a store and buy shoes before that.” Nike SB made an impact on what is known today as sneaker culture, and in an article from Hypebeast, which says \"the success of SB and my desire to have them to the cool color schemes which allowed us as a community to nickname each shoe and the coinciding box colors that signaled different eras\" and with limited product and high demand it added more to the triumph of Nike SB at the time.\nIn 2020, Nike partnered with Ben &amp; Jerry’s. The NIKE SB Dunk Low Chunky Dunky went on sale in May, and sold out almost immediately. The last collaboration with a consumer brand that did this well was a pair made with Heineken almost two decades ago.\nIn 2023 Nike SB arguably had their biggest year to date, featuring several limited collaborations Featuring Jarritos, Yuto Horigome, Crenshaw, Supreme, and Born X Raised which had a delayed release due to the passing of Chris \"Spanto\" Printup the Founder of Born X Raised. This collaboration was envisioned by Spanto to represent the streets of LA and sold out in minutes of its release, with many claiming it to be sneaker of the year in 2023.\nTeam.\nAustralian team.\nFootage of the Australian team skateboarding at the 2012 Thunderdome competition event, held at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, was uploaded to the website of Skateboarding Australia, the government-funded organisation that ran the event.\nA Nike SB film of Australian riders Boserio and Alex Campbell was released on April 4, 2014. Entitled \"Two Up,\" the video's trailer was uploaded to the brand's YouTube channel on March 24, 2014, and is produced and directed by Chris Middlebrook.\nDeath of Lewis Marnell.\nAn official announcement on January 20, 2013 revealed that Lewis Marnell had died in the 48 hours prior to the announcement. Details of the death were not provided. Marnell had released a Nike video part in the 18 months prior to his death—Nike SB's \"The SB Chronicles – Vol. 1\". Fellow Nike team riders Rodriguez and O'Neill published tributes on the Internet. Marnell's other Nike video parts are contained in \"Nothing But The Truth\" and \"Don't Fear The Sweeper\".\nThe Nike Skateboarding website featured a large photo of Marnell on its homepage and published the following tribute:\nIt is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we are to inform you of the passing of our longtime professional rider friend, Lewis Marnell. A skater who's incredible trademark pop could only be matched by the warmth of his smile, Lewis was an amazing person both on and off his board and will be truly missed. Our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Rest In Peace.\nMarnell's death occurred during the production of the second volume of the \"SB Chronicles\" video series and he had not yet released a signature model shoe with the brand."

It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 March 2007. The Chief Executive of the centre is Roger Draper.\nThe centre has 16 outdoor courts, covering all the Grand Slam surfaces, six indoor courts, a gymnasium and sports science and medical facilities. It also houses the administration of the LTA, which was previously based at the Queen's Club in West Kensington.\nConstruction.\nThe National Tennis Centre was built in response to a 1999 review by the LTA of the reasons for its sustained failure to produce world class tennis players (the only British players of either sex to make the world top fifty in the 1990s were Tim Henman, who did not come up through the LTA system, and Greg Rusedski, who learned to play in Canada). It was inspired by the national tennis centres in the more successful tennis nations of France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and the United States and serves as a focus for high performance players and coaches.\nPreviously the LTA's elite training facilities were at Queen's Club, but they were deemed inadequate for the purpose and Queen's is better known as a social club for wealthy Londoners rather than as a centre of sporting excellence. The LTA sold Queen's Club back to the club members. The south-west London location was chosen because it is close to the All England Club, home of the Wimbledon Championships, and many leading British players live in the area.\nThe National Tennis Centre was designed by Hopkins Architects, the designers of Portcullis House.\nThe Sport Canopy won a British Construction Industry Awards in 2011.\nThe Centre has been criticised for not producing world class tennis players and financial waste.\nThe centre closed in September 2014. Under the new model overseen by the LTA's chief executive, Michael Downey, the NTC was to remain the administrative headquarters of the organisation, but the elite players were only to use the 22 courts for occasional training camps."

        "text": "Frank Bernard Walker (born August 6, 1981) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Green Bay Packers, Baltimore Ravens, Minnesota Vikings and Dallas Cowboys. He was selected by the New York Giants in the sixth round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tuskegee University.\nEarly years.\nWalker attended Booker T.

As a junior, he appeared in nine games, playing right cornerback opposite Drayton Florence. He also was employed as a nickel back.\nHe contributed to the school winning 3 consecutive SIAC Football Championships (2000–2002). He finished his college career with 92 tackles (64 solo), 2 sacks, 6 tackles for loss, 6 interceptions and 34 passes defensed. In 2013, his jersey number was retired by Tuskegee University.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nWalker was selected by the New York Giants in the sixth round (207th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he played in ten games, recording 74 tackles and 2 interceptions. He made his NFL debut on October 26 against the Minnesota Vikings.\nIn 2004, he appeared in 13 games, missing the first 3 with a broken sesamoid bone. He had one start at right cornerback against the Cincinnati Bengals.

He appeared in 15 games with 5 starts, tallying 33 tackles, one interception, 14 passes defensed, 2 special teams tackles and 2 forced fumbles. He was part of the NFL's second-ranked defense.\nIn December, Walker was accused of spitting in the mouth of Pittsburgh Steelers punter/holder Mitch Berger after Jeff Reed kicked an extra point in Pittsburgh's 13–9 win. He appeared to have tried to dive into Reed's knees. A brief scuffle ensued. Berger apparently tried to break it up. At that point the spitting was supposed to have occurred. Walker denied the incident being intentional.\nIn 2009, he appeared in 14 games with one start against the Indianapolis Colts. He struggled with penalties during the season. He registered 14 tackles and one interception.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nOn October 13, 2010, Walker signed with the Minnesota Vikings, after Cedric Griffin was lost for the season with a right knee injury.

        "text": "Tennis Channel is an American sports-oriented digital cable and satellite television network owned by the Sinclair Television Group subsidiary of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. It is devoted to events and other programming related to the game of tennis, along with other racquet sports such as badminton, pickleball, and racquetball. Launched on May 15, 2003, the channel is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, and produces its programming out of an HD-capable broadcast center in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City. Ken Solomon serves as the network's Chief Executive Officer.\nTennis Channel is available across the United States from most cable providers and on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network. As of April 2023, 40 million households had access to the channel.\nHistory.\nIn 2001, Tennis Channel was founded by Steve Bellamy in the shed in his backyard, who soon hired Bruce Rider to head up programming and marketing. A group known as the \"Viacom Mafia\"—a group that includes Viacom's former CEOs, Philippe Dauman and Frank Biondi, and current CEO, Thomas E. Dooley—became involved in the founding of the channel. This group invested and rounded up additional investors, Bain Capital Ventures, J.P. Morgan Partners, Battery Ventures, Columbia Capital, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who as a group invested about $100 million. These founders felt with other single sports channel like the Golf Channel succeeding with a mostly male demographic and tennis having viewer of both sexes and of a desirable high-end demographic that a tennis channel would draw in advertisers. The channel officially launched on May 15, 2003, after its first live event, a Fed Cup tie in Lowell, Massachusetts, was broadcast in April as part of a \"sneak preview\". Barry MacKay was one of the original commentators.\nIn 2005, Tennis Channel acquired the ATP Tour's Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic in Scottsdale (which it had held the television rights to) from IMG, and moved it to Las Vegas as the Tennis Channel Open in 2006. Tennis Channel announced plans to hold women's and junior events alongside it.\nIn 2005, after struggling viewership (having only reached a subscriber base of 5 million by 2006), attributed to a lack of coverage of high-profile tournaments (such as the Grand Slam), the channel's David Meister was replaced by Ken Solomon. On February 1, 2006, Tennis Channel became a charter member of the new Association of Independent Programming Networks. Tennis Channel's senior vice president of distribution Randy Brown was a co-founder of the group, alongside The American Channel's Doron Gorshein.\nOutbidding ESPN by double, Tennis Channel acquired cable rights to the French Open in 2006. The network sub-licensed approximately half of the package to ESPN, at a lower cost than ESPN would have paid for the entire tournament. In 2008, Tennis Channel sold the Tennis Channel Open event back to the ATP, citing growth of its core businesses tied to its rapid acquisitions of Grand Slam tournament rights; beginning 2009, Tennis Channel also split cable rights to the US Open with ESPN.\nIn April 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network was speculated as expressing interest in purchasing the channel to complement beIN Sports, though nothing came of this. The channel opened an online store selling professional and lifestyle golfing merchandise and gear on August 14, 2013. The store is operated by Delivery Agent under the Shop TV brand.\nIn 2013, Tennis Channel launched its TV Everywhere service Tennis Channel Everywhere. On May 25, 2014, the network also launched Tennis Channel Plus, a new direct-to-consumer subscription service including coverage of additional events not seen on television, also including digital rights to the French Open outside of the finals. Tennis Channel carriers receive a cut of profits from the service.\nIn 2015, Tennis Channel acquired rights to the Citi Open, an ATP World Tour 500 and WTA International tournament in Washington, D.C., under a four-year contract. The event was formerly part of the US Open Series, but withdrew due to frustration over ESPN (rightsholder of the series due to its new contract to be exclusive broadcaster of the US Open proper) only promising a limited amount of television coverage.\nSinclair era.\nOn January 27, 2016, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest owner of over-the-air television stations in the United States, announced that it would acquire Tennis Channel for $350 million. In the statement announcing the purchase Sinclair CEO David Smith said that Tennis Channel had high-quality content and advertisers, though it had been valued low and was under-distributed. Sinclair also gets greater than $200 million of net operating losses to offset its future taxes. The deal was closed on March 2, 2016. Days later, Tennis Channel announced an extension to its contract for the French Open. In addition, citing its preference to hold rights to the entire tournament, ESPN dropped its sub-licensing agreement with Tennis Channel for the French Open, giving it exclusive cable rights to the tournament (NBC continues to be the broadcast television rightsholder).\nIn March 2017, Sinclair additionally acquired \"Tennis\" magazine and Tennis.com, seeking to integrate Tennis Channel with them to boost its cross-platform presence.\nIn October 2018, it was announced that Tennis Channel had acquired rights to the 46 overseas events of the WTA Tour under a five-year deal beginning in 2019, replacing beIN Sports. beIN had acquired the WTA Tour rights as part of a larger deal covering 30 countries, but the deal faced criticism from U.S. viewers due to the network's narrow carriage (only serving half as many households as Tennis Channel, with several top providers having also dropped the channel that August), as well as frequent scheduling conflicts favoring soccer coverage.\nIn 2019, Tennis Channel reached a five-year extension of its rights to the Citi Open. The tournament also re-joined the US Open Series under new ownership.\nIn October 2020, Tennis Channel renewed its rights to the ATP Tour, and also added rights to Masters 1000 events held in North America beginning in 2021 (previously aired by ESPN under a separate contract). This made Tennis Channel the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of all Masters 1000 events.\nProgramming.\nThe network broadcasts live tournaments, news, one-on-one interviews, game analysis and skills instruction. Tennis Channel provides extensive coverage of the Davis Cup (until 2018), Fed Cup and Hopman Cup as well as other tournaments throughout the year. Tennis Channel is the exclusive cable rightsholder of the French Open; while it previously sub-licensed portions of this coverage to ESPN, this arrangement ended in 2015.\nHigh-definition.\nThe Tennis Channel launched an HD simulcast on December 31, 2007.\nCarriage disputes.\nOn September 4, 2011 during the US Open, Tennis Channel pulled its signal from Verizon FiOS, Cablevision, Suddenlink Communications, Mediacom, WOW!, Knology and General Communication Inc. systems after the providers declined to accept a new agreement that the Tennis Channel made with the National Cable Television Cooperative (a group which the seven providers are members). Along with a fee increase, the agreement also required that the Tennis Channel be moved from their optional sports package to their digital basic tiers. Tennis Channel returned to Verizon FiOS on January 17, 2012.\nIn July 2012, the Federal Communications Commission ruled in favor of Tennis Channel following a three-year dispute between the network and Comcast over placement on extra-fee sports tier. As a result of the ruling, Comcast was prompted to remove Tennis Channel from its sports package tier, available to customers via an extra charge, and carry the network on the same basic cable tier as Comcast-owned Golf Channel and NBCSN. The FCC found Comcast's previous handling of the network to be discriminatory. This marked the first time that a cable distributor was found to have violated federal anti-discrimination rules. Comcast successfully disputed the ruling in 2013, continuing to carry Tennis Channel on its sports package. Tennis Channel appealed to the Supreme Court, but was denied a hearing."

        "title": "Oberliga (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Oberliga (English: \"Upper League\") is the third tier of ice hockey in Germany, below DEL2 and ahead of the Regionalliga. Since the 2015/16 season, the league has been split into two regionalised divisions, Nord (north) and Süd (south). The Oberliga was originally founded in 1948 and is administered by the German Ice Hockey Federation (DEB).\nHistory.\nThe \"Oberliga\" is the oldest continuously operating ice hockey league in Germany. The league was formed in 1948 after WWII as the highest level of hockey in Germany. The Oberliga has been the top, second and third level of ice hockey in the German league pyramid throughout its history. The 1948/49 Oberliga champions, EV Füssen, were the very first Deutscher Meister (English: German champion). In 2015/16, Oberliga was the first German league to admit a Dutch team, Tilburg Trappers, to compete in the German league system.\n1948–58.\nThe Oberliga started its first season in 1948/49 with six teams. Those teams played a home-and-away season to determine the German champion. The founding members of the league were:\nEV Füssen won the inaugural Oberliga championship and were named Oberliga and German champions. The league expanded to eight clubs for the second season and twelve in the third. From 1952 to 1956 the league trimmed the number of teams back to eight before working to restore the number to 12 by the 1957/58 season. The 1957/58 season was the last one for the league as the highest level of play in Germany. The German Ice Hockey Federation decided to form the \"Eishockey-Bundesliga\" to replace the Oberliga as the new top division. The top eight clubs from the \"Oberliga\", qualified for the new top division with the bottom four remaining in the Oberliga.\n1958–73.\nThe \"Oberliga\" had now become the second tier of German ice hockey (second division). The league started with eight clubs, including the four remaining clubs from the previous season. The league expanded to twelve in the coming seasons. The year 1966 saw the league split into northern and southern regionalised groups. The two separate leagues were called \"Oberliga South\" and \"Oberliga North\". The winners of the two leagues would determine the \"Oberliga\" champion in a home-and-away series.\nThe league reunited in a single division in 1970, now with a strength of 16 teams and direct promotion to the \"Bundesliga\".\nThe 1972/73 season was the last one as a tier-two league. With the foundation of the \"2nd Bundesliga\", the \"Oberliga\" fell to tier three. While the league champion moved up to the \"Bundesliga\" and the teams placed two to nine gained entry to the new second division, only the bottom seven clubs remained in the league.\n1973 saw DEB introduce a new second division to the German ice hockey pyramid, with the formation of the 2nd Bundesliga. The Oberliga was demoted to become the new German third division (third highest level of ice hockey in Germany). 1972-73 was the last season Oberliga operated as the division two league. The Oberliga champion that season was granted automatic promotion to the Bundesliga. Clubs that finished second to ninth qualified for automatic entry to the new 2nd Bundesliga, while the bottom seven clubs remained in Oberliga.\n1973–94.\nThe \"Oberliga\" was now again divided into a northern and a southern group. The top two teams out of the two divisions originally played out a promotion round to the \"2nd Bundesliga\" which also served to determine the \"Oberliga\" champion. While the modus and number of teams in the league continued to fluctuate, the overall situation remained the same.\n1994–99.\nThe year 1994 saw major changes in the German league system. The \"Bundesliga\" and \"2nd Bundesliga\" merged to form the new \"DEL\", an independently run league consisting of 18 clubs in its foundation years. Those second division clubs that did not elect to join the \"DEL\" were integrated into the new \"1st Liga\", which had replaced the \"Oberliga\" and operated in a northern and a southern group. The best teams of each of the two divisions played out a \"DEB\" championship, similar to the old \"Oberliga\" championship.\nThe 1998-99 season was very much a transition season. The \"DEB\" had reintroduced a single-division, nationwide league, titled \"Bundesliga\" to compete with the \"DEL\". The league below was now the \"1st Liga\", which was made up of those clubs from the \"1st Liga\" not adCentred to the new \"Bundesliga\" and \"2nd Liga\" clubs. However, this situation existed for only one season.\n1999–present.\nFrom 1999, the league returned to its traditional name \"Oberliga\", with two regional groups, north and south. In turn, the league above it took the name \"2nd Bundesliga\". The \"DEL\" renamed itself \"DEL - Bundesliga\".\nDue to a lack of interest, the \"Oberliga North\" dissolved after the 2000-01 season. The three clubs from this region that were still interested in playing at the \"Oberliga\" level joined the southern division.\nThe \"Oberliga South\", largely made up of Bavarian clubs, continued to operate successfully in the coming season, usually including a couple of northern clubs, while the \"Oberliga North\" was not reestablished until 2007.\nThe \"ESBG\", now operating the \"2nd Bundesliga\" and \"Oberliga\" for the \"DEB\", decided to reform an \"Oberliga North\" in 2007. The two separate divisions of the league were however not completely independent of each other, like in the past. Teams from the same league would meet each other four times now, while clubs from different divisions would only meet twice in the regular season. At the end of this, a combined play-off round would determine the \"Oberliga\" champion.\nIn 2007–08, the \"Oberliga\" was split into northern and southern groups for the first time since 2001. The northern group contains nine, and the southern ten clubs. The four top teams from each group enter a best-of-five play-off round to determine the \"Oberliga\" champion and the two teams promoted to the \"2nd Bundesliga\". The bottom four in each group enter a play-down round to determine the relegated teams.\nIn the 2008–09 season, the league played in a single-division format, before switching to four regional divisions with an Oberliga championship at the end from 2010 onwards.\nIn the summer of 2010, the organisation of the Oberliga broke away from the ESBG and the format was changed:\n 2.)Fass Berlin-\n 3.)Eisbaeren Juniors\n 4.) Schönheide\n 5.)... . \n the teams are in the Season 2023/2024 in Berlin-(Regional-Liga)/(or)/(Oberliga)in the ice hockey teams in Berlin /(Germany)\nTBM"

        "text": "The 2nd Eishockey-Bundesliga was the second tier of Ice hockey in Germany until 2012/13 and has since been replaced by DEL2. Starting in 2002, the league was organized by the ESBG ( mbH), to which the league organization was outsourced from the DEB, the German ice hockey federation. In the 2012–13 season, it featured 13 teams.\nHistory of the 2nd Ice Hockey Bundesliga.\nThe league was first introduced in the 1973–74 season as the second tier of German ice hockey, the level below the \"Ice hockey Bundesliga\".\nFrom 1994.\nThe large number of insolvencies of second division clubs in 1994 was the reason for the abolition of the \"2nd Bundesliga\" and the introduction of the \"Deutsche Eishockey Liga\" with 18 teams, without promotion and relegation. A number of top clubs from the second division were admitted to the \"DEL\".\nBelow the former \"2nd Bundesliga\", the \"Oberliga\" now became the highest league still under control of the \"DEB\". The \"Oberliga\" was however renamed \"1st Liga\" for the next couple of seasons, until returning to its old name.\nFrom 1998.\nAs the highest single-division for the \"DEB\", a new league was formed in 1998, receiving the name \"Bundesliga\". The decision to name the new league \"Bundesliga\" led to conflicts between the \"Deutschen Eishockey-Bund\" and the \"Deutsche Eishockey Liga\", since the \"DEL\" was of the opinion that it owned the right to call itself \"Bundesliga\", being the highest league in the country. For this reason, the \"DEL\" logo also carries the name \"1st Bundesliga\" in smaller letters below. Eventually, a compromise was reached, naming the new league \"2nd Bundesliga\" instead.\nFrom 1999.\nSince 1999, the league became the \"2nd Bundesliga\" again, which is organized today by the \"Eishockeyspielbetriebsgesellschaft\" (\"ESBG\"). As in the \"DEL\", the clubs must undergo a strict financial examination.\nDespite this fact, some clubs still found themselves in financial difficulties throughout the season and had to withdraw, like the \"EC Bad Nauheim\" in the past. The \"Moskitos Essen\" and \"Eisbären Regensburg\" both declared insolvency on 15 April 2008, being unable to meet their debts. Both clubs were immediately relegated from the \"2nd Bundesliga\". Due to the structure of the \"2nd Bundesliga\", where all teams playing are separate companies operated by the mother club, the insolvency of one of those does not mean the club itself becomes insolvent.\nIn the 2008–09 season, the \"Tölzer Löwen\" had to declare insolvency and, despite coming second in the league, were relegated. Because the \"Füchse Duisburg\" had to return their DEL licence, the champion of the 2nd Bundesliga has the option of promotion to the DEL this season.\nPromotion and relegation.\nIn November 2007, the \"DEL\" has introduced promotion to the league once more. The teams placed 15th and 16th in the \"DEL\" will play a best-of-seven series to determine which club faces the \"2nd Bundesliga\" champion for a place in the league. There is however an ongoing dispute about those games as second division clubs can only have five foreign players on contract and therefore face a handicap in comparison to the \"DEL\" clubs with currently twelve. For now, the \"ESBG\" has declared that no club from the \"2nd Bundesliga\" would take part in these matches and therefore no promotion/relegation with the \"DEL\" will take place.\nThe two bottom teams in the \"2nd Bundesliga\" are relegated to the \"Oberliga\" and the top-two \"Oberliga\" teams promoted to this league."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Germany",
        "text": "Ice hockey in Germany is one of the more popular sports, and ranks behind Handball and football in spectator favour and meaning. Ice hockey is organized today in Germany by the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, the highest professional league, and by the Deutschen Eishockey-Bund ice hockey federation, which is the sport's federation in Germany and a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation.\nThe men's national ice hockey team stands seventh in the world on the current IIHF rank list.\nHistory.\nGames similar to ice hockey were popular in winter time not only in the Alps but also at lakes and rivers all over Germany for centuries. The traditional food Eisbein is named after a bone which is used for making ice skates. In 1864 the first skating club was found in Frankfurt, in the same city opened in 1881 the third artificial ice skating rink in the world (after London and Baltimore), but it was the first with a cooling system with ammonia. Even if it covered only 520 m2 and was operating only for advertising reasons, it was replaced 10 years later by a permanent one.\nThe beginning of ice hockey in Germany brought a rapid decline of the traditional German games played with a stick on ice. The first registered ice hockey game in Germany was played on February 4, 1897 on the Halensee Lake in Berlin. The participants were Akademischer SC 1893 Berlin and a team of students.\n1901 saw the first German club create its own ice hockey department, the Berliner Schlittschuhclub. As a consequence, further ice hockey associations or departments developed first in Berlin and then in other large German cities. In 1908 ice hockey was taken up as section of the Deutscher Eissport-Verband. On 19 September 1909 Germany became the sixth member nation of the predecessor organization of the IIHF, the \"Ligue International de Hockey sur Glace\" (LIHG).\nBy 1910, when Germany participated in the first Ice Hockey European Championships, a city league with ten teams was already playing in Berlin. Besides the Berliner Schlittschuhclub of the BFC Preussen, the teams were the Sportclub Berlin, the Berliner Eislaufverein 1904, the BFC Britania, the Berliner EV 1886, the Hockey Club Berlin, the Sportklub Komet, the SC Charlottenburg, and the Eislauf Verein Berlin. In 1912, the first German championships were held, which the Berliner Schlittschuhclub would win.\nAfter the First World War, Germany was excluded from the LIHG in 1920 and could thus not in any LIHG tournaments. On 11 January 1926 the Deutsche Eissport-Verband, the body responsible for ice hockey in Germany, was re-admitted to the LIHG, and Germany was once again able to participate in the European Ice-Hockey championships beginning in 1927.\nUntil 1940, the development of the ice hockey in Germany made great strides. At the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, Germany attained the bronze medal, and during the European championships (then a qualifier for the Ice Hockey World Cup) won the European title in 1930 and 1934. The 1936 Winter Olympics saw a contentious issue arise when the Nazi party were forced to include a Jewish player, (Rudi Ball), on the team. Ice hockey developed further in this time period with the emergence of new regional organizations across the country.\nAfter World War II, Germany was again excluded from the LIHG in April 1946. At this time a national league for the best teams, the Oberliga (Ice Hockey), developed in the Federal Republic, while the Soviet occupation zone, the later German Democratic Republic, took its own development. (\"See Also:\" Ice Hockey in the DDR)\nThe Federal Republic of Germany was admitted to the LIHG on 10 March 1951; the GDR joined as an independent member with the Deutschen Eislauf-Verband der DDR on 9 June 1954.\nThe Oberliga was replaced 1958 by the reintroduced Ice Hockey Bundesliga, before 1963 the Deutsche Eishockey-Bund was created, which remained under the umbrella of the Deutschen Eissport-Verbandes. Internationally the national team of the FRG created the jump into the A-World Championship, where they could be established end of the 1970s and into the 1980s. However, it never ranked among the top four teams in the world.\nThe national team in 2018 Winter Olympics gained a silver medal.\nNational team.\nCoaches, Players and rankings of the Germany national team.

        "title": "The Skeleton Dance",
        "text": "The Skeleton Dance is a 1929 \"Silly Symphony\" animated short subject produced and directed by Walt Disney and animated by Ub Iwerks. In the film, four human skeletons dance and make music around a spooky graveyard—a modern film example of medieval European \"danse macabre\" imagery. It is the first entry in the \"Silly Symphony\" series. In 1993, to coincide with the opening of \"Mickey's Toontown\" in Disneyland, a shortened cover of the cartoon's music was arranged to be featured in the land's background ambiance. The short's copyright was renewed in 1957, and as a published work from 1929 it will enter the US public domain on January 1, 2025.\nSummary.\nThe strokes of midnight echo throughout a spooky moonlit cemetery, a group of living skeletons soon rise from their graves and start dancing.\nPlot.\nThe short film begins with an owl perched on a branch, in front of the full moon: it lets out long whistling hoots as it inflates and deflates its belly. A branch appears from the owl's right and turns into a sinister hand and tries to touch it, which frightens the owl. Subsequently, the short film shows an empty graveyard with a church in the background. In front of the church is a trunk with several branches, which are moved by the wind. The minute hand on the church's clock strikes twelve, causing its bell to start tolling, which causes a group of bats to flee from the belfry. The last two bats fly towards the screen before a spider drops down from the tree and crawls right, going off-screen.\nThe silhouette of a dog inflates and deflates with a howl at the Moon, while two cats fight over a grave. The fight ends when a skeleton emerges from the grave. This terrifies the cats, causing them to flee. The skeleton walks, runs and jumps until it hears the sound of the owl. This terrifies it, so it hides behind a grave. The skeleton, now angry about over-reacting over the owl's hooting, detaches its head from its neck and chucks it at the owl, knocking the owl's feathers off. Subsequently, the head (seemingly on its own) bounces back to the grave and returns to its body. There were four skeletons in the grave: they check that there is no danger. After this, the skeletons emerge from the tomb and start dancing. Then, one of them takes two bones out of one of their partners and plays its spine, vertebrae and head to produce music. Another skeleton dances alone and then plays a cat's tail as if it were a violin. The crowing of a rooster is telling them is it is becoming dawn. The skeletons rush to hide, but their bodies collide and blend together. The skeletons, now mingled, return to the grave, but one of the skeletons left their legs so then a hand comes out of the grave and grabbed the legs.\nProduction.\nThe origins for \"The Skeleton Dance\" can be traced to mid-1928, when Walt Disney was on his way to New York to arrange a distribution deal for his new Mickey Mouse cartoons and to record the soundtrack for his first sound cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie\". During a stopover in Kansas City, Disney paid a visit to his old acquaintance Carl Stalling, then an organist at the Isis Theatre, to compose scores for his first two Mickey shorts, \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\". While there, Stalling proposed to Disney a series of \"musical novelty\" cartoons combining music and animation, which would become the genesis for the Silly Symphony series, and pitched an idea about skeletons dancing in a graveyard. Stalling would eventually join Disney's studio as staff composer.\nAnimation on \"The Skeleton Dance\" began in January 1929, with Ub Iwerks animating the majority of the film in almost six weeks. The soundtrack was recorded at Pat Powers' Cinephone studio in New York in the following month, along with that of the Mickey Mouse short \"The Opry House\". The final negative cost $5,485.40.\nReception.\n\"Variety\" (July 17, 1929): \"Title tells the story, but not the number of laughs included in this sounded cartoon short. The number is high. Peak is reached when one skeleton plays the spine of another in xylophone fashion, using a pair of thigh bones as hammers. Perfectly timed xylo accompaniment completes the effect. The skeletons hoof and frolic. One throws his skull at a hooting owl and knocks the latter's feathers off. Four bones brothers do a unison routine that's a howl. To set the finish, a rooster crows at the dawn. The skeletons, through for the night, dive into a nearby grave, pulling the lid down after them. Along comes a pair of feet, somehow left behind. They kick on the slab and a bony arm reaches out to pull them in. All takes place in a graveyard. Don't bring your children.\"\n\"The Film Daily\" (July 21, 1929): \"Here is one of the most novel cartoon subjects ever shown on a screen. Here we have a bunch of skeletons knocking out the laughs on their own bones, and how. They do a xylophone number with one playing the tune on the others spine. All takes place in a graveyard, and it is a howl from start to finish, with an owl and a rooster brought in for atmosphere.\"\nIn 1994, \"The Skeleton Dance\" was voted #18 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.\nRelease.\nIn order to attract a national distributor for the \"Silly Symphony\" series, Walt and Roy Disney arranged for \"The Skeleton Dance\" to run at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles and at the Fox Theatre in San Francisco in June 1929, while Pat Powers arranged for it to play at New York's Roxy Theatre from July. In early August, Columbia Pictures agreed to distribute the Silly Symphonies, and \"The Skeleton Dance\" played as a Columbia release in September at the Roxy, making it the first picture in the theater's history have a return engagement.\nIn March 1931, \"The New York Times\" reported that the film had been banned in Denmark for being \"too macabre\".\nHome media.\nThe short was released on December 4, 2001, on ' and on December 2, 2002, on '. It was released to Disney+ on July 7, 2023.\nVideo game.\n\"The Skeleton Dance\" appears in the 2012 video game \"\" as an unlockable short."

        "text": "The 2006 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2005 season. The game was played on February 12, 2006, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. It marked the 27th consecutive time that the National Football League's all-star game was held in Honolulu. The NFC all-stars won by the score of 23 to 17.\nGame summary.\nThe start of the game was interrupted by a surprise rainstorm that lasted through the first quarter, although it ended midway through the second. Both teams' first possessions were punted away, and each of their second drives ended in interceptions; the Chicago Bears' Nathan Vasher intercepted Peyton Manning, then John Lynch picked off Matt Hasselbeck. The AFC scored first on their next drive, culminating with a 16-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Chris Chambers. After the teams traded punts, Michael Vick took over for the NFC in the second quarter, and led the team to the AFC 15-yard line, where Neil Rackers kicked a 32-yarder to make it 7–3. Manning led the AFC right back down the field, and Shayne Graham's 31-yard field goal increased the AFC's lead.\n On the NFC's next drive, Champ Bailey intercepted Vick for the AFC's second turnover (both interceptions came off passes intended for Steve Smith). However, the NFC's defense responded with another interception; this time, Darren Sharper returned the interception 35 yards to the AFC's 32-yard line. The NFC was forced to punt it away on their next drive, however there was some controversy on the return. Jerome Mathis was set to receive the punt deep in the AFC's zone, and when the kick from Josh Bidwell came near him, he opted not to touch it. However, it glanced off his leg and rolled into the end zone, where the NFC recovered it, seemingly for a touchdown. However, the officials did not see the ball hit Mathis, and since there is no instant replay in a Pro Bowl game, NFC coach John Fox could not challenge the call. The AFC took over on their own 20, but soon afterward the NFC defense came up with another interception. Roy Williams intercepted a Manning pass and returned it 11 yards before handing it off to the Atlanta Falcons' DeAngelo Hall, who took it 57 yards to the AFC's 20. Michael Vick hit tight end Alge Crumpler with a 14-yard touchdown pass with 8 seconds left in the half to tie the score at 10–10.\nJake Delhomme of the Carolina Panthers took over at quarterback at the start of the third quarter, and hit Steve Smith, with three straight passes. The Carolina Panthers provided the NFC's team with their coaching staff, and with the Panthers' quarterback and wide receiver running the offense, the NFC moved quickly down the field. The drive stalled at midfield, and the NFC punted it away. After the AFC's drive, led by Chiefs' quarterback Trent Green, ended in a punt, Delhomme once again moved the NFC downfield before being sacked by Casey Hampton, forcing a fumble that was recovered by the AFC's Marcus Stroud. The NFC's defense once again responded, and on the third play of the drive, Derrick Brooks returned an interception 59 yards for a touchdown that gave the NFC the lead at 17–10. After the AFC punted away their next drive, Santana Moss fumbled the ball away in AFC territory. Green led the AFC down the field again, thanks in large part to a 20-yard run by his Chiefs teammate, Larry Johnson. Green tied the game at 17–17 with a one-yard quarterback sneak. Matt Hasselbeck took over for the NFC again, and led the team on a scoring drive, ending with a 22-yard field goal by Rackers that gave the NFC the lead again. Steve McNair came in for a play at AFC quarterback, and promptly fumbled the ball away. After the NFC punted the ball away, McNair came back and lost another fumble, giving the NFC the ball on their own 18-yard line. Following the fumble, the AFC switched to a shotgun formation. After another Rackers field goal, the AFC took over on their own 26 with 1:10 left. McNair brought the AFC to midfield, but could not get them the touchdown they needed, and the game ended on a sack by the New York Giants' Michael Strahan. Brooks was given the Most Valuable Player award.\nAFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\n\"Source\"\nNFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\n\"Source\"\nNotes:\nFan balloting.\nOn December 19, 2005, the NFL announced that fans had cast more than 70.5 million votes via the Internet and the Sprint wireless telephone service, bettering by more than 16% the 61 million votes cast for the 2005 Pro Bowl.

        "text": "Jack Thomas Snow (January 25, 1943 – January 9, 2006) was an American professional football player who played wide receiver with the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL from 1965 to 1975. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish from 1962 through 1964.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nSnow was a three-sport star at St. Anthony Boys' High School, Long Beach, California who totaled 10 varsity letters while competing in football, baseball and basketball. He was an All-state football receiver during his senior season and went on to post a .458 batting average as an All-city baseball performer.\nCollege.\nIn his senior year at Notre Dame, he was a consensus All-American and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1964 behind the winner, Notre Dame quarterback John Huarte. The 1964 season was coach Ara Parseghian's first season with Notre Dame, and he made several key position switches that year, including moving Snow from flanker to split end. Snow lost 15 pounds to compete more effectively as a split receiver. Notre Dame's passing offense in Parseghian's first season helped produce 27 team and individual records, including five set by Snow for receptions (60), receiving yards (1,114) and touchdown catches (9) in a season; receiving yards in a game (217, vs. Wisconsin); and career receiving yards (1,242). He broke the previous record for receiving yards in a game (208, by Jim Morse in a 1955 game vs. USC), more than doubled the old record for receiving yards in a season and scored 19 more receptions in one season than any previous Notre Dame player. Snow also averaged nearly 37 yards per kick as the 1964 team's punter.\nNFL career.\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Snow in the first round (he was the eighth pick overall) in the 1965 NFL Draft but soon traded him to the Rams. Snow broke into the Rams' starting lineup in his rookie season of 1965 and remained there. In 1967, he averaged a career-high 26.3 yards per reception and scored eight touchdowns on his 28 receptions. He was named to the West squad in the NFL Pro Bowl but did not appear in the game.\nSnow gained a reputation for catching the long pass from quarterback Roman Gabriel. He remained the Rams' starter at split end until 1974-1975, when he divided time with fellow receivers Lance Rentzel, Harold Jackson, and Ron Jessie. He finished his professional career with 340 receptions and 45 touchdowns; his 6012 career receiving yards ranked 30th in NFL history. \nActing and broadcasting career.\nSnow appeared in the 1969 motion picture \"Marooned\". He appeared as himself in the 1969 episode \"Samantha's Shopping Spree\" of the television series \"Bewitched\". He played Cassidy in the comedy \"Heaven Can Wait\". \nFollowing his NFL career, Snow went into the real-estate business with college roommate Bob Arboit in Newport Beach, California. He returned to the Rams as a receivers coach in 1982 under Ray Malavasi. In 1992, he joined Los Angeles sports-talk radio station KMPC (now KSPN) as an analyst for Rams radio broadcasts and a daily program host. He followed the team to St. Louis in 1995 and was one of a handful of old L.A. Rams still employed by the Rams in the 2005 season, 11 years after their departure from southern California. \nDeath.\nSnow developed a staph infection in November 2005 and died at age 62 as a result of complications.\nFamily.\nSnow's son J.T. Snow is a retired Major League Baseball first baseman for the San Francisco Giants and Anaheim Angels. Following the senior Snow's death, the junior Snow changed his uniform number in his father's memory while playing for the Boston Red Sox."

He also played for the New Orleans/Portland Breakers of the United States Football League (USFL) from 1984 to 1985.\nEarly life.\nRoss attended Everett High School in Everett, Massachusetts, where, as a tight end, he starred on the football team.\nCollege career.\nRoss played college football at Northeastern University in Boston from 1975 to 1978. He was named first-team selection on the College Football All-America Team in his senior year of 1978 while serving as team captain. He also earned the Bulger Lowe Award as the outstanding player in New England and the Harry Agganis Award as New England's outstanding senior.\nRoss left Northeastern as the Huskies' all-time leader in receptions (153), receiving touchdowns (13) and receiving yards (2,343). He also set the single-season records for those categories as well, with 68 receptions for 988 yards and seven touchdowns in his senior season. After his senior year, Northeastern retired jersey No. 84 in his honor.\nNFL career.\nAfter graduating college in 1979, he was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals with the 30th pick in the second round of the 1979 NFL Draft. Ross' best season was in 1981, when he totaled 71 receptions for 910 yards and five touchdowns, helping lead the Bengals to Super Bowl XVI. His 71 receptions were a single-season franchise record, and would remain so until Carl Pickens had 99 in 1995.\nRoss had an outstanding performance in the Super Bowl, with a record 11 receptions for 104 yards and two touchdowns. His receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns were all the most by a tight end in Super Bowl history. However, the Bengals lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 26–21, preventing Ross from being the likely winner of the Super Bowl MVP award and first tight end to ever receive it. \nIn addition to his impressive Super Bowl performance, Ross was the Bengals' leading receiver in both playoff wins that year, with six receptions for 71 yards in their 28-21 win over the Buffalo Bills and five receptions for 69 yards in their AFC title win over the San Diego Chargers, a game known as the Freezer Bowl and the coldest game ever played in the NFL.\nRoss went on to make his first and only Pro Bowl selection in 1982 on the strength of 47 receptions for 508 yards and three touchdowns in the nine-game season shortened by a players strike.\nIn 1984, Ross briefly left the NFL to play for the New Orleans Breakers and later the Portland Breakers in the newly formed United States Football League.\nHe returned to play for the Bengals in 1985, and finished the season with the Seattle Seahawks.\nRoss joined the Green Bay Packers for the following season, and then retired in 1987.\nIn his eight NFL seasons, Ross recorded 290 receptions for 3,419 receiving yards and 19 touchdowns.\nRoss later said that as a veteran of a small college not known for its football program, he was grateful for a chance to play in the big leagues. \"Just getting drafted was a thrill. You don't expect it from the school I went to. At the time, you don't expect to play in the National Football League, and especially somebody taking you with the 30th overall pick. It's like 'oh geez they must see something I don't'.\"\nPersonal life.\nRoss later became president and co-owner of WPWB, an independent TV station in Riviera Beach, Florida. He was owner and president of Power House Supply, while also coaching Pop Warner Football and participating in charity golf tournaments.\nIn 2004, he was enshrined into the College Football Hall of Fame. Northeastern University also recognized the achievement with a halftime ceremony honoring Ross at the October 9, 2004, home game against Villanova University. He was the first Northeastern University player enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame.\nDan Ross died at age 49 on May 16, 2006, after collapsing at his home in Atkinson, New Hampshire, shortly after returning from jogging. He died at Merrimack Valley Hospital in Haverhill, Massachusetts.\nHe was survived by his wife, Joan, and two children, Jillian, then 23, and Dan Jr., then 22.\nTrivia.\nRoss's record 11 receptions in a Super Bowl was eventually shared by three other players:\nIt was finally broken in Super Bowl XLVIII by Demaryius Thomas, who caught 13 passes.\nRoss' record of receiving yards in a Super Bowl (104) by a tight end was broken by Travis Kelce's 133 yards in Super Bowl LV"

        "title": "Don Fleming (American football)",
        "text": "Donald Denver Fleming (June 11, 1937 – June 4, 1963) was an American professional football player who was a safety for three seasons during the early 1960s with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). Fleming played college football for the Florida Gators, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Cleveland Browns of the NFL. His career was cut short by his accidental death by electrocution in 1963.\nEarly life.\nFleming was born in Bellaire, Ohio, in 1937 to Denver Fleming. He attended Shadyside High School in Shadyside, Ohio, where he was a standout prep player for the Shadyside Tigers high school football team.\nCollege career.\nFleming attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Bob Woodruff's Florida Gators football team from 1956 to 1958. Fleming was the Gators' team captain in 1958, and he finished his college football career as a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection. Woodruff ranked him as the Gators' best receiver of the 1950s.\nThe Chicago Cardinals drafted Fleming following his senior football season, but he chose to remain in school and exhaust his remaining NCAA baseball eligibility playing for coach Dave Fuller's Florida Gators baseball team from 1958 to 1960. He was the captain of the Gators baseball team, and led the Gators in home runs and stolen bases.\nProfessional career.\nFleming was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the 28th round (327th pick overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft, but he remained at the University of Florida and did not play during the NFL season. He successfully urged Chicago management to trade him to the Cleveland Browns before the start of the season. Fleming was a close friend of another Browns defensive back, Bernie Parrish, a fellow Florida graduate, and the two were said to be almost inseparable during the NFL season. Over the following three years, Fleming played regularly at safety, intercepted ten passes, recovered four fumbles, and made \"The Sporting News\" All-NFL team in .\nDeath and legacy.\nFleming, his wife Rosalie and their son Ty lived in his hometown of Shadyside, Ohio, during football season, and in Winter Park, Florida, during the NFL off-season. As a 25-year-old NFL All-Conference selection, Fleming was already planning for when his professional football career ended. He had majored in building construction at the University of Florida, and had been working as a foreman for a Central Florida construction company during the off-season to stay in shape and gain industry experience. On June 4, 1963, Fleming and a co-worker, Walter Smith, were operating a crane on a construction site west of Orlando, Florida, when the boom of the crane brushed an overhead 12,000-volt high-tension electrical transmission line. Fleming and Smith were electrocuted, and attempts to revive them at the hospital failed.\nEarlier the same day, the Browns had announced that Fleming had signed his contract for the 1963 season. His death came only 17 days after that of Ernie Davis, the overall No. 1 pick in the 1962 NFL Draft, whom the Browns had acquired in a trade. The Browns retired both Davis' uniform number No. 45 and Fleming's No. 46 in memory of the players. Fleming Field at Shadyside High School, Fleming's alma mater, is named in his memory. When the Browns practiced at Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (Hiram College), the field house they used also carried Fleming's name.\nFleming was nominated for the Florida Sports Hall of Fame within days of his death, and he was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\""

        "title": "Skeleton Warriors",
        "text": "Skeleton Warriors is a 13-episode cartoon series created by Landmark Entertainment Group, which originally aired in 1994 on CBS. The show was created by producer Gary Goddard.\nSummary.\nThe story takes place on the fictional distant planet of \"Luminaire\". The conflict of the plot revolves around the need to control the Lightstar Crystal, which powers the great city of Luminicity. Baron Dark, the show's main villain, tried to steal the crystal in order to gain control over its incredible power. He only succeeded in obtaining half of the crystal, with the other half being obtained by Prince Lightstar.\nThe half of the crystal that the Baron Dark managed to obtain turns him into a living skeleton. It also gives him the power to turn those with evil hearts into living skeletons for his army. Each episode involves Prince Lightstar, his siblings and Baron Dark attempting to obtain the other half of their respective crystals in order to gain control over the planet.\nPrince Lightstar forms part of the \"Legion of Light.\" It consists of Justin Lightstar a.k.a. Prince Lightstar, Joshua Lightstar a.k.a. Grimskull, and Jennifer Steele a.k.a. Talyn. They also have been endowed with great powers through their half of the Crystal. They team together with their uncle Ursak (a.k.a. Guardian) to battle the evil Baron Dark. While Baron Dark is transformed into an undead skeleton and given the ability to transform other living beings into his Skeleton Warriors, the Legion of Light gains other fantastic abilities: Lightstar gains the ability to channel energy through his hands, Talyn gains the power of flight, and Grimskull is transformed into an undead creature similar to the Baron, but also has the power to travel through shadows.\nCharacters.\nHeroes.\nPrince Justin is the leader of the Legion of Light and the one meant to protect the Lightstar Crystal. After its loss, he continually strives to protect humanity and defeat the skeleton warriors. He greatly frustrates the Baron by displaying the clear limits to his power: a person of good heart cannot be turned into a skeleton warrior. When the Lightstar Crystal was shattered, Justin received the ability to project powerful beams of energy out of his hands or through his sword, which later is declared by Ursak to be (or possibly contain, considering the relative sizes of the sword and crystal) an actual piece of the Lightstar Crystal.\nTalyn is a fierce warrior, a gracious princess, a caring soul, and an unwavering defender of the righteous. She somehow manages to combine all her devotion to the fight against evil with great compassion. After the struggle which shattered the Lightstar Crystal, she was granted the power of flight and managed to reconcile Justin and Joshua. Her later exploits include finding a way to actually restore skeleton warriors to the flesh – by removing the \"heart gems\" that appear after the transformation. Although this discovery is a tactical advantage and a source of hope, it also spurred Baron Dark on to worse acts; if any skeleton warrior is restored to human form, he could use his power to transform them back into skeletons, but, since he was the only one who possessed this power, if he himself was restored, no one else would be able to transform him back into a living skeleton.\nJustin's younger brother, who initially worked together with Baron Dark out of misplaced envy of his older brother. When Justin and Dark struggled for the Lightstar Crystal, Joshua interfered. The resulting surge of power turned him into an undead creature, but where Dark and his Skeleton Warriors are pure skeletons, Joshua - who was renamed Grimskull - is still covered in flesh. Grimskull is seeking redemption by helping his family; he saw the baron's evil during the fight which transformed him. Grimskull is granted the power to travel through shadows wherever he wishes. After his transformation, he befriended a wolf, which he named \"Stalker.\"\nUrsak is the brother to the late king and the uncle to the Steele children. He serves as their adviser, second-in-command, mentor, and surrogate father. He is a skilled combatant who leads from the front, as well as a highly competent scientist designing various weapons and armor for the Legion of Light's members.\nVillains.\nThe greedy and evil baron tried to seize the Lightstar crystal for himself and caused it to break in two. His half turned him into a living skeleton who has the power to turn any person with the slightest bit of darkness in his or her heart into a skeleton warrior like himself. Baron turns them into skeleton warriors with \"Heartstones,\" and he says \"Darkest Soul, Evil's Courier, Serve me as a Skeleton Warrior.\" He is obsessed with defeating the Legion of Light and taking control of both halves of the Lightstar Crystal, thereby granting absolute power for himself.\nDr. Cyborn is a half skeleton/half-machine who was Baron Dark's scientific expert and high-tech weapon maker. Dr. Cyborn is the Skeleton Legion's mad scientist and is Baron Dark's second-in-command. Self-created in his demented laboratory, Dr. Cyborn grafted bionic parts to his own body after a near-fatal accident. The scientist's dream came true when Baron Dark gave him his skeletal form. Now, this twisted genius serves the Baron as he devises weapons to destroy the Legion of Light.\nPreviously a stunningly beautiful woman, Shriek with her evil heart was transformed into a female Skeleton Warrior in order to \"add a woman's touch,\" according to Baron Dark. In the days prior to becoming a living Skeleton, Shriek was powerfully attracted to Prince Justin. After she became a Skeleton Warrior her crush persists, albeit unreciprocated. According to the \"Skeleton Warriors\" presentation at Toy Fair 1994, the character's working name was \"Banshee.\"\nAn arachnid-like creature possessing six arms before being turned into a Skeleton Warrior, Aracula speaks almost entirely of grunts, screeches, and other animal-like sounds. He serves mostly as a bodyguard and berserker-type fighter who tries to overwhelm his opponent through sheer brute force. He maintains his spider abilities despite being a skeleton. In \"Long Live the King\", it is revealed that his people have been enemies of humans for centuries.\nInitially, Baron Dark's dwarfish, slavish aide, later his dwarfish, slavish, skeletal aide, but is mainly the baron's loyal servant. Even when he was briefly restored to the flesh, he continued to work for the baron's interests and longed to be restored to the skeletal state his master had imparted upon him.\nA werewolf-like creature hired by Baron Dark to patrol Luminicity for anyone who tried to cheat him out of tribute money. After skeletonizing himself, Claw joined the rest of Dark's lieutenants.\nHome media.\nSkeleton Warriors was released in a 2-disc set on December 6, 2011 in North America, featuring all 13 episodes.\nMerchandise.\nThe cartoon also spawned a toyline created by Playmates Toys, a comic book limited series created by Marvel Comics and the \"Skeleton Warriors\" video game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation consoles developed by Neversoft and published by Playmates Interactive."
