        "title": "2013–14 Division 1 season (Swedish ice hockey)",
        "text": "The 2013–14 season of Division 1, the third tier of ice hockey in Sweden, organized by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association (SIHA), began on 11 September 2013. The regular season concluded on 16 February 2014. The following playoffs towards the qualifier to the second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan began on 19 February 2014 and ended on 7 March 2014. The qualifiers to Division 1 began on 2 March 2014 and ended on 26 March 2014. The qualifier to HockeyAllsvenskan began on 13 March 2014 and ended on 5 April 2014. The 2013–14 season was the last season the league was named \"Division 1\"; in April 2014, the league was renamed \"Hockeyettan\".\nFormat.\nThe league featured 53 teams (a contraction from the 56 of the 2012–13 season), divided into five geographical groups. This was another change from past seasons, which featured six groups, lettered A through F. This season, however, groups A and B were merged into Division 1 \"Norra\" (\"North\"). With the exception of Division 1 North, the teams played each team in their initial groups three times, at least once at home and once on the road. In North, the teams played each team four times, twice at home and twice on the road. As with previous years, groups C through F played until the new year, when the top four teams from each group moved into two new groups, Allettan \"Mellan\" (\"central\") and Allettan \"Södra\" (\"south\"), while the remaining teams played a continuation series in the original groups. Division 1 North, however, continued playing in the same group until the conclusion of the regular season. In the continuation groups, the teams received \"starting points\", dependent on their rankings in their initial groups; the lowest-ranked team received no points, the second-lowest-ranked 2 points, the third-lowest-ranked 4 points, and so on. In the Allettan groups and the 1F continuation group, the teams played each team in their group twice, once at home and once on the road. In the other continuation groups, the teams played each team in their groups three times, at least once at home and once on the road. After the conclusion of the spring series and Division 1 North, the best-ranked teams of Division 1 North, Allettan Central, and Allettan South continued to the playoffs. The four teams that survived the playoffs would continue to the 2014 HockeyAllsvenskan qualifier (Swedish: \"Kvalserien till HockeyAllsvenskan\"). Meanwhile, the teams with the poorest records in North, as well as the continuation groups C through F, would play in the Division 1 qualifiers to retain their spots in Division 1 for the 2014–15 season.\nTwo teams from Division 1 North, three teams from each of the continuation groups of Division 1 C, D and E, and four teams from the Division 1 F continuation group had to participate in the Division 1 qualifier (Hockeyettan) groups. Only the top team from each of those groups would be guaranteed a Hockeyettan spot in the 2014–15 season, meaning that the league would be cut short by 10 teams and that at least 10 teams would be relegated to Division 2. The SIHA contracted the league down to 47 teams for the 2014–15 season, requiring the SIHA to promote the four second-placed teams in Division 1 qualifiers C–F, the third-placed team from qualifier E, and the third-placed team from qualifier F (the latter two to replace Falu IF, who voluntarily demanded relegation, and bankrupt Nyköpings HK).\nPlaying format.\nEach game consisted of three 20-minute regulation periods, for a total of 60 minutes. After the 60 regulation minutes, the team with the most goals scored won the game. If the game was tied after regulation time, a five-minute overtime period ensued, in which the team scoring the next goal won the game. If no team scored during the overtime period, a shootout ensued, with each team taking three penalty shots against the opposing team's goaltender. If the game was still tied after the three penalty shot rounds, additional rounds ensued until one team scored and the other team didn't. Points were awarded for each game, with a win in regulation time giving 3 points, an overtime/shootout win 2 points, an overtime/shootout loss 1 point, and a regulation loss 0 points.\nTiebreak.\nIn case two or more teams ended up tied in points, the following tiebreakers were used:\nParticipating teams.\nr = Relegated from 2012–13 HockeyAllsvenskan&lt;br&gt;p = Promoted from 2012–13 Division 2\nNote that Botkyrka HC merged with IFK Tumba Hockey during the off-season.\nInitial groups.\nDivision 1 North.\nDivision 1 North was formed out of a merger of Division 1A and 1B. It consisted of 12 teams, and play continued in this group through the entire regular season.\nPromotion playoffs.\nThe promotion playoffs was divided into three rounds: Playoff 1, Playoff 2, and Playoff 3. The six top-ranked teams from Division 1 North, the four top-ranked teams from each of the Allettan groups, and the top ranked team from each of the continuation groups qualified for the playoffs. Each playoff match-up was a best-of-three series, with the winners of each playoff round continuing to the next round. In each series the higher-seeded team received home advantage and played an eventual third game at home if necessary to determine a winner of the series. The four teams winning the final round, Playoff 3, continued to the 2014 HockeyAllsvenskan qualifier (\"Kval till HockeyAllsvenskan\") and attempted promotion to the second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan.\nPiteå, Nyköping, and Vita Hästen won the North and Allettan groups, and therefore received byes to the third round. Sundsvall had the best points average of the second-place North and Allettan teams, and therefore also skipped to the third round. The two other second-place teams, KRIF and Visby also finished, received byes to the second round.\nIn Playoff 1, match-ups were determined by the standings in each spring series (including Division 1 North). In Playoff 2 and Playoff 3, match-ups were determined through random draw.\nPlayoff 1.\nKiruna IF, Östersunds IK, Hudiksvalls HC, Huddinge IK, Tingsryds AIF, and Kristianstads IK won their match-ups, and continued to Playoff 2. They defeated Kalix UHC, Tegs SK, Tierps HK, Wings HC Arlanda, Västerviks IK, and Mariestad BoIS HC respectively.\nPlayoff 2.\nThe six Playoff 1 winners were ranked by their record in their spring series, on the basis of 1) which spring series the teams played in (i.e. Allettan or the continuation series, except Division 1 North), 2) ranking in the standings, 3) points average, 4) goal difference, and 5) goals scored. The two highest-ranked Playoff 1 winners and the two directly-qualified teams faced the four other Playoff 1 winners. The four match-ups were determined through random draw.\nPlayoff 3.\nThe four directly-qualified teams faced the four Playoff 2 winners. The four match-ups were determined through random draw. Piteå HC, Tingsryds AIF, HC Vita Hästen, and Kallinge-Ronneby IF both swept their series and proceeded to the 2014 HockeyAllsvenskan qualifier.\nDivision 1 qualifiers (Hockeyettan).\nThe winners of the five qualifiers were guaranteed spots in the league for the 2014–15 season. In order to get 47 teams in the 2014–15 season, the SIHA also promoted the four second-placed teams from qualifiers C–F. However, two of those 47 teams pulled out of the league during the preseason, resulting in two other teams from the qualifiers being promoted:\nHockeyAllsvenskan qualifier.\nThe four playoff winners—HC Vita Hästen, Kallinge-Ronneby IF, Piteå HC, and Tingsryds AIF—played the two lowest-ranked teams from HockeyAllsvenskan—IF Björklöven and IF Troja/Ljungby—in a double round-robin tournament, facing each team once at home and once on the road for a total of 10 games per team. HC Vita Hästen managed to promote to HockeyAllsvenskan at the expense of IF Troja/Ljungby, while IF Björklöven defended their HockeyAllsvenskan spot."

Davis High School.\nWilliams attended Merced College. He was signed by Houston as an undrafted free agent in May 1972 and began his pro career in the Rookie-level Florida East Coast League that season. He reached the Triple-A level in 1975 and made his Major League debut on June 12 of the 1978 season in the eighth inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at the Astrodome. Pitching in relief of Joe Niekro with the Astros trailing 4–0, Williams allowed a run during his inning of work to make the score 5–0, Pittsburgh. But in the bottom of that inning, Houston scored six runs and won the game, 6–5. Williams (removed for a pinch hitter during Houston's six-run rally) was credited with the victory, while Joe Sambito picked up the save.\nWilliams worked in 17 games for the 1978 Astros, including one game as a starting pitcher, and fashioned a 1–2 record and a 4.67 earned run average in 34 innings pitched.\nThe following year, he appeared in 31 games for Houston, and made 16 starts. In May 1979, he recorded two complete game shutouts, the only two of his Major League career. On May 20, he blanked the San Diego Padres on five hits, beating future Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry, 1–0. Eleven days later, he went the distance and whitewashed the Cincinnati Reds on seven hits, 3–0.

        "text": "Ashford (Kent) Golf Club is a private members golf club located off the A20 road to the west of Ashford, Kent, England, close to junction 9 of the M20 motorway which leads on to the Channel Tunnel and Ports with good access to the Continent.\nThe present course was first laid out in 1926. With many feature pine and oak trees, narrow fairways and small greens, it provides a good test for golfers of all abilities. The club is owned by its 600 members and celebrated its centenary in 2003.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded by twenty members on 27 April 1903. It started playing that same year on a seven-hole course at Bybrook – about a mile and a half west of the present course. The initial subscription was two guineas, and the cost of laying the course out and the first year's operations was £182.10. By the end of the second year the course had been extended to nine holes.\nThe club thrived in its early years with membership in the second year of 90, 40 of whom were ladies.\nThe First World War saw a huge decline in membership, but the club struggled through to the summer of 1918. Unaware that the armistice was just a few months away, the club decided that the course had to close, even temporarily.\nThe club reopened in 1919 with 90 members and a new groundsman / professional. By 1923 the membership had grown to 160.\nIn 1925 the lease of the then existing course was terminated but the club was offered the opportunity to buy 130 acres at Sandyhurst Farm.\nSurmounting huge difficulties in raising the necessary finance, the club opened its new 18-hole course in 1927. The course was designed and construction supervised by David Herd, the professional at Littlestone Golf Club. In 1933 the club elected its first Lady President – Miss Jeanne de Casalis in recognition of her huge efforts in raising finance for the club and other local causes.\nBattling financial pressures all the while the club grew steadily until the Second World War. Notwithstanding a hugely diminished membership, the loss of 20 acres of land requisitioned for food production and huge concentrations of bombing in the district play continued throughout the hostilities.\nBy the end of the war there were only 46 members left. Nevertheless, the club picked up again after the war. The missing 20 acres were sold and the course re-designed on the remaining 100 acres with C K Cotton retained as architect.\nThe club grew gradually until 1962, with about 250 members. In that year no fewer than 140 new members were elected and the club appointed its first paid part-time secretary/treasurer. A waiting list was created and joining fees created. Membership stood at about 550 in 1965.\nThe last major upheaval occurred in 1980, when land was taken for the construction of the motorway, including the previous clubhouse. Additional land was leased from Ashford Borough Council, the course re-modelled and the present clubhouse constructed."

The Danville Champions played in the Central League in 1900 and the Danville Old Soldiers in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League in 1906.\nThe Danville Speakers played in the Eastern Illinois League in 1908 and in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League (Three-I League) from 1910 to 1914. Major leaguers Medric Boucher, Cecil Coombs, Bob Fisher, Buck Hopkins, Pete Hildebrand, Hosea Siner, Bert Graham, Rube Sellers, Connie Walsh, Otto Vogel, Walt Devoy and Hod Eller played for the Speakers in its short time in existence under that moniker. They moved to Moline, Illinois and became the Moline Plowboys during the 1914 season.\nThe Danville Veterans rejoined the Three-I League in 1922–1932, winning league championships in 1927 and 1930. Danville was an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals from 1927–1932.\nAfter World War II, the Brooklyn Dodgers came to town with their Danville Dodgers affiliate in the Three-I League.\nIn 1946 the Dodgers looked to have Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe play for the Danville Dodgers. Campanella and Newcombe signed contracts with Danville, but never played there after the idea of integrating received push back. Instead, the players went to the Nashua Dodgers.\nAfter the Dodgers left, the team remained as the Danville Dans, joining the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League and winning the 1951 Championship and later capturing the Midwest League Championship in 1954, reflecting the new league name of the old Mississippi-Ohio Valley League. The Dans were affiliated with the Boston Braves (1952), Chicago White Sox (1953) and New York Giants (1954).\nAfter a period of fifteen seasons without a minor league team, the 1970 Danville Warriors rejoined the Midwest League, playing at Danville Stadium. The Warriors were a co-op club in 1970, before becoming a Milwaukee Brewers affiliate in 1971 and remained a Brewers farm club through 1974. The Warriors experienced their share of success in their five years. They were Southern Division first half champions in 1971 (losing to Quad Cities in the playoffs); won the Southern Division in both halves in 1972, going on to win the Midwest league championship; again won the division first half championship in 1973, beating Decatur in the first round of the playoffs but losing in the championship round to Wisconsin Rapids; and winning the second half division championship in 1974, going on to win the league title by defeating Quad Cities and Appleton in succession.\nThe Danville Dodgers name was reborn in 1975, when it became a Los Angeles Dodgers farm club for two seasons. The franchise folded after the 1976 season.\nThe 1982 Danville Suns rejoined the league for one season as an affiliate of the California Angels. The franchise relocated to Peoria, Illinois to become the Peoria Chiefs in 1983. The Danville Dans of the summer collegiate Prospect League have played since 1989, utilizing Danville Stadium.\nBallparks.\nDanville minor league teams played at Soldiers Home Park from 1922 to 1932. Teams between 1946 and 1982 played at Danville Stadium. Danville Stadium is still in use by today's Danville Dans and is located at 610 Highland Boulevard in Danville, Illinois."

        "text": "The 2013–14 ISU Speed Skating World Cup, officially the \"Essent ISU World Cup Speed Skating 2013–2014\", was a series of international speed skating competitions that ran the entire season. The season started on 8 November 2013 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and concluded with the final on 16 March 2014 in Heerenveen, Netherlands. Compared to previous seasons, there were fewer competition weekends; the season was restricted due to the 2014 Winter Olympics, which were arranged in Sochi, Russia, during February 2014. In total, six competition weekends were held at six different locations, twelve cups were contested (six for men, and six for women), and 72 races took place.\nThe World Cup is organized by the International Skating Union (ISU).\nCalendar.\nThe detailed schedule for the season. Additionally, the team sprint was a demonstration event in Inzell.\nEntry rules.\nQualification criteria.\nIn order to qualify, skaters must have achieved the following results in ISU events, international competitions or national championships between 1 July 2012 and the entry deadline for the competition concerned.\nFor the mass start and team pursuit events, skaters who have achieved any one of the above results will qualify.\nNation quotas.\nEvery ISU member nation may enter at least one competitor for each distance, subject to the qualification criteria above. Additionally, skaters placed among the top 36 in the final 2012–13 World Cup, or included in the final qualifying list (including the reserve list) of the 2013 World Single Distance Championships, for the distance category concerned, may be entered. Member nations not mentioned may enter maximum one skater for each distance.\nFor the mass start event, a member nation may enter maximum three skaters, all subject to the qualifying criteria above. For the team pursuit event, a member nation may enter one team only per category (men/women).\nCompetition format.\nSeeding of skaters.\nIf the number of entered skaters exceeds a certain limit, skaters compete in two separate divisions, A and B. In the first competition, the composition of skaters in the respective division is determined by the ranking of the skaters in the respective distance category from the 2012–13 World Cup and the seeding submitted by the respective team leaders before the draw. For each country and distance category, the number of skaters in the ranking top of the previous year will decide the number of places available in Division A, but the team leader's seeding will decide which skater goes into which division.\nIn the following competitions, the current World Cup ranking is used, with special considerations to top-placed skaters in Division B of the previous competition. A skater may also under certain conditions apply for a wild card for Division A, but only the first time the skater participates in a distance category, and not in the first and last competitions of the season. In the last competition for the season, there will be no Division B.\nPoints system.\nPoints tables.\nWorld Cup points for all competitions, except the last, are awarded in both divisions, using two sets of tables, A1/B1 and A2/B2. Tables A1 and B1 are used when the number of competitors in Division A exceeds 16, while tables A2 and B2 are used when that number is between 12 and 16. However, if table B1 was used for Division B in the first race in an event that is raced twice in the same competition, it will be used also in the second race, regardless of the number of competitors in Division A.\nFor the last competition, since there will be no Division B, points will be awarded using table A3.\nMass start ranking.\nThe mass start races will be over 20 laps for men and 15 laps for women. There will be 3 intermediate sprints, at 5, 10 and 15 laps for men, and at 4, 8 and 12 laps for women. Race points will be awarded to the four first skaters at the intermediate sprints, and to the six first skaters at the final sprint. The accumulated points a skater collects during a race will decide the final ranking. For skaters who are tied in race points, including those who have failed to collect any, their finishing order will be break the tie.\nGrand World Cup.\nIn order to determine an overall World Cup winner, one for men and one for women, a special points system is used, awarding points for the top five skaters in each individual event.\nPrize money.\nAdditionally, the Grand World Cup winner of each category (men/women) is awarded $20000.\nWorld records.\nWorld records going into the 2013–14 season.\nMen.\nOn 9 November 2013, in the team pursuit race in Calgary, the Dutch team, comprised by Koen Verweij, Jan Blokhuijsen and Sven Kramer, broke the world record with a time of 3:37.17. The next weekend, on 16 November, the same skaters improved the record further, to 3:35.60.\nWomen.\nOn 9 November 2013, in the second 500 metres race in Calgary, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea improved her own world record with a time of 36.74 seconds. The next weekend, in Salt Lake City, Lee broke the record twice. First, on Friday, she lowered the record to 36.57 seconds. On Saturday, she improved it another 21/100, to 36.36 seconds. On Sunday, 17 November, also in Salt Lake City, Brittany Bowe broke the world record on 1000 metres with a time of 1:12.58."

        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured India between 10 October to 2 November 2013, playing a Twenty20 International match and seven-match One Day International series against India. Due to an ongoing back injury, Australian captain Michael Clarke was replaced by Callum Ferguson and George Bailey captained the side. During the second ODI match, all of the first five Australian batsmen made a score of fifty or more, a feat which no side had previously done. In the second match, India chased down the target of 360 runs to win, making this the second highest run-chase to win an ODI game. Two weeks later in the sixth match, India again chased down the Australian total of 350 runs to record the third highest run-chase to win a game. Coincidentally, all three highest run chases had come against Australia. In the seventh and final match, Indian batsman Rohit Sharma became the third man to make a double-century in ODI cricket, when he scored 209 from 158 balls. His innings included 16 sixes, the most in an ODI innings beating the previous record of 15 held by Australian cricketer Shane Watson. The record was later broken by England's Eoin Morgan who hit 17 sixes against Afghanistan in 2019.\nODI series.\n2nd ODI.\nA historic match in ODI history unfolded as Australia elected to bat on a high scoring pitch. Aaron Finch completed his half-century and was well on his way when he was run out by Suresh Raina. After getting to his fifty, Shane Watson was soon dismissed by Vinay Kumar on 59. Phillip Hughes fell 17 runs short of his 3rd hundred and was dismissed by Ravichandran Ashwin. Australian captain George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell both scored fifty and Australia ended their innings on 359/5 with George Bailey standing not out on 92. This was the first instance of all of the top five batsmen scoring at least 50 runs in an ODI, the second instance happened 7 years later in 2020.\nIndia then started nicely and compiled 100 runs in just 16.2 overs with the loss of no wicket.\nBoth openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma completed their fifties and added 176 runs for the first wicket before Dhawan got caught behind off James Faulkner. Virat Kohli then came to the crease and was dropped on the first ball. Kohli then got a good start and completed his half century in 27 Balls. Rohit got to his 3rd hundred in 100 balls, and Kohli got the fastest hundred by any Indian batsman, the century coming in just 52 balls and India went on to win the match by 9 wickets with 38 balls to spare.\nStatistics.\nRohit Sharma was awarded the man of the series after scoring 491 runs. At the end of the series there were several changes in ICC Batsman rankings. Virat Kohli was ranked as the number 1 batsmen while George Bailey reached his career best of 3rd Spot."

        "title": "Indios de Ciudad Juárez (baseball)",
        "text": "The Indios de Ciudad Juárez were a Mexican League professional baseball club which played in several leagues during 23 seasons spanning 1946–1984. The Indios were based in Ciudad Juárez, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The team also was known as the Ciudad Juárez Indios or the Juarez Indios. The team's name was chosen to honor statesman Benito Juárez, who described himself as the son of Indians of the primitive race of the country.\nEarly history.\nOrganized Mexican baseball started in 1937, when a league featuring teams from the cities of México, Tampico and Veracruz played a modest 25 game schedule. Gradually increasing the number of games, the independent Mexican baseball circuit was playing nearly a 100-game schedule by the end of World War II.\nAt the beginning, teams in the Mexican League, which played in the winter, included on their rosters baseball stars of the Negro National League. Prohibited from playing in Organized Baseball, the African-Americans ballplayers were welcomed and excelled in Mexico. For instance, in 1938 Martín Dihigo posted an 18-2 record and a 0.90 earned run average as a pitcher, while winning the batting title with a solid .387 average. Two years later, Cool Papa Bell won the Triple Crown, while batting .437 with 12 home runs and 79 runs batted in.\n1946.\nIn 1946, the Mexican National League was founded and joined the ranks of Organized Baseball as a Class B circuit. The league included six franchises that represented Mexico City (Aztecas), Chihuahua (Dorados), El Paso (Tejanos), Saltillo (Peroneros), Torreón–Gómez Palacio (Laguneros), and Ciudad Juárez (Indios). Unfortunately, it was to be a short-lived experiment because of competition from an independent Mexican League. This operation, bankrolled by Mexican entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, placed franchises in two of the same cities, Mexico City and Torreón, forcing the Class B competition to fold. As a result, the MNL México and Torreón clubs retired in late April and the remaining of the league collapsed on May 27, just when Juárez and Chihuahua were tied in first place with a 23-21 record. After that, the outlaw Mexican League also became a threat to Major League Baseball for the rest of the decade.\n1947–1954.\nIn 1947 the Indios de Ciudad Juárez took refuge in the Class C Arizona–Texas League, but suspended operations during the midseason and were replaced by the Mesa Orphans. When the Indios reorganized in 1948, they changed their misfortune and advanced to the postseason three years in a row.\nIn 1948, Ciudad Juárez finished fourth with a 74-66 record and lost the league finals to the Globe-Miami Browns. They improved to 92-58 in 1949, good for a second place, but did not advance from the first round.\nThen, in 1950 they won the regular season with a record of 93-55 and defeated the Phoenix Senators in the best-of-seven Series, four games to two. That season, Ciudad Juárez was managed by Syd Cohen, a former Washington Senators pitcher, better known for giving up Babe Ruth his final home run and final strikeout for the New York Yankees in 1934.\nIn 1951 the Arizona–Texas League merged with the Sunset League to form the Southwest International League. Ciudad Juárez finished second with an 87-57 record in the 10-team league, but did not advance pass the first round of the playoffs.\nThe Arizona–Texas League broke off again in 1952, operating through 1954, before changing its name to the Arizona–Mexico League the following season. The Indios were successfully in this three-year span, claiming their second championship title in 1952 with an 84-55 record, and ending 74-65 for a third place in 1953. By the time playoffs were not played. Then, the league expanded from six to eight teams in 1954 and became more competitive, which affected the Indios performance, which ended last with a 55-85 mark, 38 games out first place. The team took a break in 1955.\n1956–1958.\nThe Indios found itself on the move again, this time in the short-lived Mexican Center League, a Class C six-team circuit that operated from 1956 to 1957. They finished with a modest record of 48-52 in 1956, enough for a third place, 10½ games out of contention. The team failed again in 1957, ending fourth with a 49-51 mark, 13 games out of first place.\nIn 1958 Ciudad Juárez became a member of the aforementioned Arizona–Mexico League. The Indios placed fifth of six teams with a record of 55-64, 12½ games out of first place. After that, the team suspended operations for a long time.\n1973–1984.\nCiudad Juárez returned to action after 15 years of absence, as part of the revamped Mexican League from 1973 through 1984. The Mexican League had begun to operate as a Triple A circuit in 1967 and was a very strong organization. By the time the Indians made their debut, the league had 16 teams distributed in four divisions.\nFollowing three disastrous seasons from 1973–1975, the Indios became a seasoned squad after that. The team won the Northwest Division in 1976 but lost in the second round of the playoffs. Then, they advanced to the finals in 1979, losing to the Angeles de Puebla in the maximum seven games.\nIn 1980, Ciudad Juárez finished second in the \"supplemental season\" put on by a few teams after the regular season was stopped by a players strike. Then, the Indios advanced to the postseason in 1981 but lost in the first round. Finally, they clinched the Championship title in 1982 and were runners-up in the 1983 and 1984 seasons, losing to the Piratas de Campeche (4-3) and the Leones de Yucatán (4-2), respectively. The Indios posted a collective record of 819–777 (.513) during their 12 seasons in the league.\nSince 1984, no other team based in Ciudad Juárez has participated in organized baseball."

        "text": "The 2013–14 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team represents Boston College in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team is coached by Jerry York, '67, his twentieth season behind the bench at Boston College. The Eagles play their home games at Kelley Rink on the campus of Boston College, competing in Hockey East.\nWith the addition of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to Hockey East, the Holy War rivalry extended to conference play between the Eagles and the Irish. The two teams played each other at Fenway Park on January 4 during the league's Frozen Fenway exhibit, where the Eagles topped the Irish in a 4–3 contest, and both teams played their final game of the season against each other at Kelley Rink on February 28, with the Irish winning 2–1 in overtime.\nThe Eagles competed in two tournaments during the 2013–14 season. The first tournament, on December 27–28, the Eagles played in the 2nd Annual Three Rivers Classic, played at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, where they defeated Bowling Green 5–0 in the first round and then won the championship by beating Penn State 8–2 in the second round. On February 3 and 10, the Eagles won their 5th straight championship in the 62nd Annual Beanpot Tournament, played at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, defeating Boston University 3–1 in the first round and Northeastern in the championship round by a score of 4–1.\nThe Eagles finished the season 28–8–4, 16–2–2 in conference play, capturing the Hockey East regular season title. However, they did not advance far into the Hockey East tournament, losing the best-of-three quarterfinals to rival Notre Dame in three games, at home. They would, however, succeed in the NCAA tournament, where they would win the Northeast Regional, played at the DCU Center in Worcester. A victory over Hockey East foe UMass Lowell advanced the Eagles to the program's 24th Frozen Four (tying Michigan for most appearances), but would lose to the eventual champions, the Union Dutchmen in the semi-final.\nPrevious season recap.\nThe Eagles entered the 2013–14 season following a first round loss to Union College in the NCAA tournament, and a semifinals loss to Boston University in the Hockey East Tournament. Their postseason woes do not accurately reflect the success of the season, as the Eagles finished with a strong 22–12–4 record and 15–9–3 in conference play, one point short of the regular season title, as well as their fourth consecutive Beanpot championship in a 6–3 win over Northeastern. Sophomore Johnny Gaudreau was a Hobey Baker award finalist after helping the US National Junior team to win a gold medal at the 2013 World Junior championship in Ufa, Russia. Head Coach Jerry York became the winningest head coach in NCAA Hockey history, passing Ron Mason, with his 925th win over Alabama-Huntsville in the 2012 Mariucci Classic.\nOffseason.\nSix Senior Eagles graduated in May: Captain Pat Mullane – F, Assistant Captain Steven Whitney – F, Brooks Dyroff – F, Assistant Captain Patrick Wey – D, Patch Alber – F, and Parker Milner – G.\nSophomore forward Johnny Gaudreau decided to remain at school for another season, to play with his younger brother Matt Gaudreau, who enrolled as a freshman this year.\nJunior forward Patrick Brown was named Captain, with fellow juniors Bill Arnold and Isaac MacLeod named Assistant Captains for the 2013–14 season.\nLong-time assistant coach Mike Cavanaugh left the team to become the head coach of the UConn Huskies hockey program.\nAssociate head coach Greg Brown was named an Assistant Head Coach for the 2014 US World Junior team that competed in Malmö, Sweden.\nLong-time assistant coach and goaltending coach Jim Logue announced his retirement after twenty years of coaching.\nBoston College hired Mike Ayers as an assistant coach and goaltending coach to replace Cavanaugh. Ayers spent his previous seasons coaching goalies on the US National Development Team\nFormer NHL player and Boston College alum Marty McInnis was hired on Sep. 12 as an assistant coach to fill the vacancy left by Jim Logue. McInnis played nearly 800 career games in the NHL and was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012.\nIn July, Connor McGlynn, who previously committed to joining Boston College in the fall of the 2013–14 season, signed with the Kingston Frontenacs of the OHL.\nRecruiting.\nBoston College added ten freshmen for the 2013–14 season: six forwards, three defensemen, and a goaltender.

The campaign began on 23 August 2014 and ended on 24 May 2015.\nBarcelona won its 23rd title on 17 May 2015 after defeating defending champions Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, and also equalled the all-time record goal difference of +89 (110 goals scored and 21 conceded), originally set by Real Madrid in the 2011–12 season.

This includes the two top teams (Eibar and Deportivo La Coruña) from the Segunda División, and the winner of the play-offs, Córdoba.\nEibar became the first club from Segunda División to achieve promotion to La Liga after its 1–0 victory over Alavés on 25 May 2014. Eibar made their La Liga debut in the 2014–15 season.\nDeportivo La Coruña won promotion back to La Liga after one season in Segunda División with a 1–0 victory over Real Jaén on 31 May 2014.\nCórdoba won the promotion play-off against Las Palmas and returned to the top level after 42 years.\nOverview.\nOn 2 May, Córdoba were relegated with three games left to play in the season, after losing 0–8 at home against Barcelona. Eight days later, Villarreal confirmed sixth place and an entry into the UEFA Europa League with Joel Campbell's winning goal against Elche.\nBarcelona, playing with a three-man attack of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez under new manager Luis Enrique, won the title on 17 May with a goal by Messi to defeat holders Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. It came exactly a year after Atlético had won their league title at Barcelona's Camp Nou. Real Madrid secured second place on the same day as Barcelona won the title, with a 1–4 win at Espanyol. In the end, Barcelona amassed 94 points, while Real Madrid finished just two points behind, with 92.\nThe battle for the Champions League was settled in the last ten minutes of the season. Valencia, in fourth place with 74 points, went into the last match of the season at relegation-threatened Almería, facing all three possibilities of direct qualification to the group stage of the Champions League, qualification to the play-off round, or missing out on the Champions League altogether. Valencia won the match 3–2 to secure fourth place, as Atlético Madrid, three points ahead, drew at Granada. Sevilla, with a 3–2 win at Málaga, achieved a record 76 points total without Champions League qualification, finishing fifth. Sevilla however qualified for the Champions League by winning the 2015 UEFA Europa League Final. \nEarlier in the season, on 7 February, Atlético Madrid achieved a 4–0 victory over city rivals Real Madrid. It was Real's biggest loss since a 5–0 loss to Barcelona in November 2010. \nDespite finishing the season in the 13th position, on 5 June, Elche was relegated to Segunda División due to its financial struggles.

        "text": "The knockout stage of the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League featured the eight teams that had finished in the top two of each of the four groups in the second group stage and lasted from 3 April to 23 May 2001. The knockout stage followed a simple, single-elimination format, with the ties in each round (except for the final) being played over two legs, with whichever team scored the most goals over the course of the two legs progressing to the next round. In the case of both teams scoring the same number of goals over the two legs, the winner would be determined by whichever team scored more goals in their away leg. If the teams could still not be separated, a period of golden goal extra time lasting 30 minutes (split into two 15-minute halves) would be played. If no goals are scored after extra time, the winner would be decided by a penalty shoot-out. As in every season of the competition, the final was played as a single match at a neutral venue, which in 2001 was the San Siro in Milan, Italy.\nThe final pitted three-time winners Bayern Munich of Germany against Spanish club Valencia, who were appearing in their second consecutive final, with Bayern winning 5–4 on penalties after the two teams could not be separated through 90 minutes and extra time. Bayern reached the final by knocking out the competition's last two champions – Manchester United (who had beaten Bayern in the 1999 final) and Real Madrid, who beat Valencia in 2000. Valencia, meanwhile, had to play two English sides en route to the final, first beating Arsenal then Leeds United. The other teams involved in the knockout stage were Galatasaray of Turkey and Deportivo La Coruña of Spain.\nQuarter-finals.\nFirst leg.\n\"All times Central European Time ()\"\nSecond leg.\n\"All times Central European Time ()\"\n\"Leeds United won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate.

        "text": "Derek Allen Ryan (born December 29, 1986) is an American professional ice hockey forward for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nAn undrafted player, Ryan played four successful seasons of Canadian university hockey and pursued a professional career in Europe before making his NHL debut at age 29. After being named the MVP of the Swedish Hockey League in 2015, Ryan signed his first NHL contract with the Carolina Hurricanes in June of that year. He played parts of three seasons with the Hurricanes before signing with the Calgary Flames in July 2018.\nPlaying career.\nRyan started his junior career with his hometown's Spokane Braves of the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League (KIJHL) from 2002 to 2004.\nRyan played four seasons of major junior hockey (2003–2007) in the Western Hockey League (WHL), again representing his hometown club, the Spokane Chiefs. With limited NHL interest due to his diminutive size, he went on to play four seasons of Canadian university hockey (2007–2011) with the University of Alberta Golden Bears in the CWUAA conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS). For his outstanding college hockey play, he was named the CIS (West) Most Valuable Player for the 2010–11 season, and was also named to the 2010–11 CIS All-Canadian First Team.\nRyan embarked on a professional career in Europe and made his debut in the 2011–12 season in the Austrian League (EBEL) with Hungarian club Alba Volán Székesfehérvár under head coach Kevin Primeau. After placing third in team scoring with 49 points in 50 games, Ryan was signed to an improved contract with Austrian club EC VSV on July 7, 2012. In his second season in Villach, Ryan lead the EBEL with 38 goals and finished with 84 points in 54 games. He was awarded the Ron Kennedy Trophy as the league's most valuable player for the 2013–14 season.\nOn April 10, 2014, Ryan moved to the Swedish Hockey League (SHL), signing a lucrative contract with Örebro HK. In the 2014–15 season, Ryan's rapid ascent in the professional leagues continued as he became the cornerstone of Örebro's offence and in leading the club to the playoffs, lead the SHL in scoring with 45 assists and 60 points to be selected as the league's Forward of the Year and the SHL Most Valuable player.\nCarolina Hurricanes and Calgary Flames.\nEarning NHL interest after defying initial size concerns, Ryan signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on June 15, 2015. He was called up to the Hurricanes in February 2016 and made his NHL debut on March 1 against the New Jersey Devils, also scoring his first NHL goal in the game, against goaltender Cory Schneider. Ryan played two full seasons with the Hurricanes, establishing himself as a versatile forward able to play both centre and wing and who could be counted on to play on both the powerplay and the penalty-killing units. Ryan also established himself as a more than reliable faceoff man; finishing with a faceoff percentage of 55.3% in the 2016–17 season, and 56.48% in the 2017–18 season.\nRyan left Carolina as a free agent to reunite with former Hurricanes head coach Bill Peters in signing a three-year, $9.375 million contract with the Calgary Flames on July 1, 2018. After a slow start to 2018–19 which saw him record only two goals in the season's first 20 games, Ryan managed to find chemistry with wingers Garnet Hathaway and Andrew Mangiapane, with the trio emerging as one of the key reasons for Calgary's first-place finish in the Western Conference. Ryan also finished a close 2nd place League wide in faceoff percentage with a percent of 58.2%, only 0.04% less than Jason Spezza. In the playoffs, Ryan recorded one goal in five games as the Flames lost to the Colorado Avalanche in the first round.\nFirmly established as the Flames' third-line centre, Ryan continued his strong play into the 2019–20 season – albeit with two new wingers. Hathaway signed with the Washington Capitals in July 2019, with his vacated spot on Ryan's wing being filled by trade acquisition Milan Lucic. Lucic endured a similar dry spell to begin his Flames tenure as Ryan had a year previously; however, the two soon found chemistry on the third line and the second powerplay unit. With Mangiapane moving up to the second line to supplant a declining Michael Frolík, who was eventually traded to the Buffalo Sabres in January 2020, Ryan and Lucic were joined by rookie Dillon Dubé. Ryan scored 10 goals and 29 points in 68 games before the season was halted prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nFollowing the completion of his contract with the Flames, Ryan left the club as a free agent, opting to remain in Alberta by agreeing to a two-year, $2.5 million contract with rival club, the Edmonton Oilers on July 28, 2021. On February 26, 2022, Ryan scored his first NHL hat-trick in a 4–3 victory over the Florida Panthers. In July 2023, the Oilers extended Ryan's contract, signing him for a two-year, $1.8 million deal.\nPersonal life.\nRyan was raised in Spokane by his parents Nancy (who died during Ryan's second season with the Alberta Golden Bears) and Tim. He has one sister. He and his wife Bonnie have a son, born in 2013, and a daughter, born in 2016.\nRyan and his wife are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."

        "title": "La Liga Wrestling",
        "text": "La Liga Wrestling (formerly World Wrestling League or Liga Mundial de Lucha), was a wrestling promotion company based out of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Founded in 2012 by businessman Richard Negrín with the cooperation of established wrestling figures such as Hugo Savinovich, the company developed a global scope, establishing alliances with over a dozen international promotions and holding shows throughout the Americas. In line with the traditional model of professional wrestling, LLW's shows do not feature legitimate sporting contests. Instead, its programs feature storyline-driven combat sport matches with predetermined outcomes and acrobatic and grappling maneuvers that are worked, which are publicly promoted as legitimate bouts to accentuate the entertainment.\nUnder its first administration the promotion featured a similar business model to other companies targeting a global audience, including a system of income that relies on licensed merchandise and an intricate developmental system employed to nurture its main roster. However, unlike the brand and contract based approach of promotions like World Wrestling Entertainment, WWL focused on the organization of cooperative events, allowing the free flow of its talents to associated companies in a system that served as a Latin American counterpart to the North American National Wrestling Alliance. After being acquired by Savio Vega in July 2016, the promotion shifted its focus to developing novel wrestlers, an approach that was continued by subsequent administrations. In January 2020, the format was changed with a rebrand, the introduction of an episodic format and the acquisition of an arena. The company also returned to its original target of promoting abroad, this time using FITE TV as a platform to reach other Hispanic markets.\nHistory.\nNegrín administration.\nPresided by Richard Negrin, produced by Hugo Savinovich and Danny Nieves Gerena as their Director of talents relations the World Wrestling League was founded in late 2012 and began its media exposition, with Josian Omed Vázquez Díaz as promotion's press manager, on January 21, 2013. The promotion was officially launched in a press conference held at the Water Club hotel in San Juan. In this event, WWL announced the signing of several high-profile Puerto Rican wrestlers, including former champions of the International Wrestling Association and World Wrestling Council Eric Pérez, Roberto Rubio and José \"Monster Pain\" Torres. The company also presented its business plan, noting that it intended to have an international scope instead of directly competing with other promotions in Puerto Rico. A series of alliances were made with several international promotions including Wrestling Alliance Revolution (WAR) in Ecuador, Leader Wrestling Assotiation (LWE) in Peru, Dominican Wrestling Entertainment (DWE) in the Dominican Republic and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in the United States. During the following months, the promotion focused on creating its final roster and production team, which saw the exclusion of Víctor Siebens, owner of the Puerto Rico Wrestling Association, who had served as producer during the first months and the inclusion of Danny Nieves Gerena who was the promoter of NWA Chicago to fill the role. In February, two of the IWA's and WWC's main producers in the past, Héctor Moyano, Sr. and his eponymous son joined to work on the production of the television show, \"Campeones del Ring\", which was launched on Tele Isla and CW Puerto Rico the following week. Axel Cruz was contracted to serve as the promotions main announcer along Moyano, with Joe Don Smith and Harold Santy serving as counterparts for the English announce table. However, the announcing staff was changed due to the death of Moyano due to illness, with José Laureano joining it before his demise. In mid-February the WWL announced the inclusion of then NWA World Champion Kahagas and WXW World Champion Joe \"Hercules\" Gómez to the roster of its first show. This was followed by alliances with Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) in Mexico and Pro Wrestling Revolution (PWR) in California, with both of these companies agreeing for their champions to expose the titles outside of their territories. On February 16, the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum was selected to host WWL's first show, \"Idols of Wrestling\". \nAfterwards, an alliance with Lucha Xtrema Nacional of Panama was established, leading to the inclusion of its champion, Panama Jack Daniels #10, who was quickly teamed with WAR World Champion Mega Star in a team known as Los Mega 10. On February 25, 2013, Ricky Banderas was announced as the challenger for the AAA Mega Championship against El Texano, Jr. in what would be the main event of the debut show. A defense of the NWA World Championship was negotiated, but was abandoned once Kahagas dropped the title. However, PWR confirmed that both its Heavyweight and Women's championships would be exposed at Idols of Wrestling. Dominican Wrestling Entertainment did the same, with the addition of DWE Heavyweight Champion Rico Casanova to the event. In the weeks leading to Idols of Wrestling, AAA vice-president Dorian Roldán confirmed his presence for the card. On March 13, 2013, TNA talent was included in the card, an occurrence that was highlighted on Impact Wrestling's Spanish broadcast. WWL went on to announce the production of an iPPV for the international public. Pro Wrestling Zero1 became the first Japanese promotion to enter an alliance with WWL, directly working with them through Pro Wrestling Mexico Zero1 and leading to the addition of its title holder Psicodelico, Junior.\nIn the final month before the event, WWL joined Gladiadores Aztecas de Lucha Libre Internacional (GALLI) and presented its World Heavyweight and Tag Team title belts. On April 9, 2013, another foreign title defense was added, with Mid West USA champion Ricky Cruzz. Idols of Wrestling went ahead without chances in the announced card, featuring six title defenses. During the course of the event, new PWR champions were crowned in the figures of Ivelisse Vélez and Blue Demon, Jr., while Monster Pain won a tournament to crown the first WWL World Heavyweight Champion by defeating Bobby Lashley in the final draw. Immediately following its first show, WWL began to work on merchandising its brand, producing its first DVD and placing licensed apparel on the market. On April 26, 2013, the promotion released its rankings for the heavyweight, cruiserweight, tag team and women's divisions. The event gathered attention from mainstream media outlets, including \"Primera Hora\", Univision Puerto Rico, America TeVé and Telemundo's Punto2 as well as specialized publications such as \"Súper Luchas\". On April 30, 2013, the promotion announced an extension of Campeones del Ring to Panamian television. WWL's next appearance was at PWR's anniversary show, where members of its roster headed by Vélez performed.\nInternational tours.\nDuring early May 2013, WWL negotiated with AAA in order to include some of its talents in Triplemanía XXI. In exchange, AAA talents joined for futures events, including some maineventerss such as Dr. Wagner, Jr. This led to the inclusion of the WWL Heavyweight Champion Monster Pain on that card, as well as the team of Pérez and Rubio in a contest for the AAA World Tag Team Championship. Pain joined Jeff Jarrett and Matt Morgan to defeat the AAA World Trios Champions, Los Psycho Circus. On May 13, 2013, WWL launched its first international tour, establishing dates for Monterrey México, San Antonio, California, Eagle Pass, Chicago, Pennsylvania, New York, the Dominican Republic and its second show in Puerto Rico. As part of this effort, an alliance was created with Fighting Spirit Wrestling (FSW) and international wrestlers including John Henningan, Mil Máscaras and Terry Funk were signed. On May 17, 2013, WWL announced that they had signed Carly Colón for their shows. This was regarded as an unexpected event, due to the fact that Colón is a main eventer in the World Wrestling Council, and that promotion's press manager, José Roberto Rodríguez, had used its official webpage to directly criticize WWL. The first talents to be contracted in June were Heddi Karaoui of All Star Wrestling U.K. and Zumbi of the Brazilian Wrestling Federation.\nOn July 7, 2013, the promotion crowned their first World Tag Team Champions, when Los Mamitos (Mr. E &amp; Sexy B) defeated the teams of Eita &amp; Tomahawk, El Hijo de Kato Kung Lee &amp; Vengador Radioactivo, and Heddi Karaoui &amp; Zumbi in a four-way match. On July 28, 2013, WWL reached an association agreement with the National Wrestling Alliance. Three days later, the promotion closed a deal with New Xtreme Order of Bolivia. In September WWL held two shows in Mexico, which were highlighted by several local wrestlers gaining victories over foreign champions. Among these were Los Mamitos who defeated the AAA World Tag Team Champions \"The Mexican Powers\" (Joe Líder and Crazy Boy) and Los Boricuas who reunited to score a win over the Los Psycho Circus, the team that still held the AAA World Trios Championship. Colón debuted by winning a three-way match over AAA Latin American Champion Blue Demon, Jr. and La Parka II. In the final title match of the 2013 season, Pain successfully defended the WWL World Heavyweight Championship against John Morrison. During the offseason, an alliance with Desastre Total Ultraviolento (DTU) and the incorporation of masked female wrestler Zeuxis were made official. On January 4, 2014, the promotion announced the second season of the Dream Matches Tour, which opens with three shows between March 7– 9. WWL made further moves to promote these events, also exploiting the publicity generated by Luis Urive's release from WWE by immediately recruiting the original Sin Cara.\nPresidential instability and hiatuses.\nThis stage opened with a series headlined by a successful defense of Los Mamitos over La Dinastía Máscaras (Sicodelico, Jr. and El Hijo de Dos Caras). Monster Pain won a triple threat match and wrestled Mil Máscaras to a no contest to remain the WWL World Wrestling Champion. On June 15, 2014, WWL announced a restructuration of its programming, introducing two new shows that debuted in the Puerto Rico subsidiary of The CW, \"Hablando de Lucha\" and \"WWL Presenta\" airing Saturdays and Sundays respectively.\nOn January 6, 2015 Director of Talent Relations Danny Nieves Gerena resigned from the company. Two months later, \non March 23, 2015, WWL founder and president Richard Negín announced his retirement from wrestling, closing the WWL.\nHowever, on April 11, 2015 WWL founder and president Richard Negrin announced that WWL once again is open for business and will debut on new network Mega TV (United States) Puerto Rico subsidiary WVOZ-TV Channel 32.1 with a new show named \"High Voltage\" debut on March 25, 2015 and creating \"The Saturday War\" competing that day's schedule 12:00 - 1:00pm with WWC the Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO).

On October 28, 2015, Negrín announced that the promotion would cease holding cards, citing that a diabetes condition was preventing him from running the organization.\nRivera brothers–Bilbraut administration, The CRASH.\nMonths later, WWL began airing a number of skits in its social media pages, eventually leading to a formal announcement that it would resume operations on March 13, 2016. A new element introduced was a new World Heavyweight Championship belt, which was forged but never debuted during 2015. Some days later, they announced their new Television Home was going to be \"America Tevé\" with their program \"High Voltage\" to debut on April 4, 2016. Then held the first TV Taping of the third season at Maxx FC Gym in Bayamon on April 30, 2016, the second and third TV Tapings at The Outlet in Canovanas on June 18, 2016 and July 16, 2016.

The second live event Started a series of live events called \"WWL High Voltage Live\" and it took place on September 17, 2016 at \"WWL Arena\" in Carolina, Puerto Rico.\nOn September 26, 2016, it was announced by General Manager Dennis Rivera that WWL stopped their TV Broadcast on America TV and now they are focused on Social Media.

On March 16, it was announced that WWL returned to TV now on the TV Channel Punto 2 starting on April 2, 2017.\nFollowing the passing of Hurricane Irma (WWL Had to cancel its live event on September 9, 2017) and Hurricane Maria over Puerto Rico, the promotion entered a forced hiatus until at least February/March 2018. Due to this, licenses were issued to talents so that they could remain active in the local independent and international circuits. WWL would return to action with \"Juicio Final\" on April 20, 2018 in Dorado.\nWWL vs. IWA.\nJuicio Final was the first event held by the promotion in 2018, culminating with an angle where Savio Vega returned to an active role and threatened to change WWL's name and relaunch the IWA trademark. Negrín responded to the storyline by appearing in a segment for the Champion Wrestling Association (CWA) in which he burned one of the original WWL World Heavyweight Championship belts and merchandise. Following weeks of promotion that included the reintroduction of several IWA titles (the Undisputed World, Tag Team and Intercontinental championships), as well as interviews with several of its former wrestlers, a match for control of the promotion was scheduled for Golpe de Estado 2018. The storyline ran for four months, facilitating the way for IWA to be formally relaunched in Florida in a move that led to Vega exiting WWL. Boris Bilbraut still is the president of the company, leaving Rondón in charge of a new administration as on air character.\nLiga Mundial de Lucha on Fite.TV.\nAround Middle 2019, WWL started branding itself \"Liga Mundial de Lucha\" then On June 1, 2019 it was announced on a press conference that La Liga Mundial Live events, TV Program and Pay Per Views were going to be part of Fite.TV Service, with \"Pena Capital\" being the first pay per view event available for the platform.

This marked a rebrand for WWL, which changed its name and business model, adopting a static home base known as the Liga Wrestling Arena in San Juan where tapings took place. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the promotion entered into an extended hiatus that lasted until 2021, remaining mostly inactive from all platforms during this timeframe. The only communication that LLW issued during this time was a tease that a return was imminent in June 2020, when the government of Puerto Rico was considering more flexible safety measures that would allow contact sports to hold events with limited attendance. However, as more outbreaks took place this development was prevented.\nAs today after the company enter in a hiatus and all talent including current champions, are working in differents companies in the island and outside, aside others companies began to use the Venue of La Liga Wrestling Arena for their tv tapings and live streaming show, Without any comment from management or executives, or any communication, and 2 years of inactivity, the company closed without any official announcement. The facebook page is still open sharing posts from his former talents.\nDevelopmental territories.\nOn March 30, 2013, WWL confirmed that it would open a developmental territory, New Borinquen Pro Wrestling, which had been originally envisioned by Danny Nieves-Gerena a year before as a strong-style promotion based on the Japanese tradition. On April 28. 2013, WWL presented NBPW's redesigned logo and improved graphics. On May 21, 2013, NBPW announced the date of its debut show setting it for June 29. The territory began its own series of signings from the Puerto Rican independent circuit, including talent with experience in the original International Wrestling Association via open tryouts. A developmental expansion followed, when WWL's alliance with GALLI evolved so that the former could become a territory based on a city with heavy Puerto Rican population. Locally, independent promotion New Revolution Wrestling briefly became a territory operating in Puerto Rico's west coast. After Nieves-Gerena resigned in 2015, NBPW broke ties with the WWL.\nOn August 20, 2018, WWL announced that Nieves-Gerena had returned to the company in an advertising role. On February 19, 2019, the NBPW Heavyweight Championship was introduced. In the process, Nieves-Gerena noted that WWL would sanction the project once again.\nBroadcasting History.\nSince its beginning, WWL has produced numerous TV programs including:\nMain Wrestling Events.\nEach year WWL promotes a number of signature events, following a Schedule for their Main Program \"High Voltage\", The annual shows, shown in order of occurrence during each year, include:\nPast Events Include.\nIdols of Wrestling (04/21/2013 San Juan), Dream Matches Mexico Tour (Late 2013/2014), Insurrection (10/18/2014 Bayamon), Navidad Corporativa (12/13/2014 Bayamon), Guerra de Reyes (01/06/2015 San Juan), Rebelión en el Sur (02/21/2015 Ponce), International Cup (03/21/2015 Bayamon), Sin Piedad (08/15/2015 Toa Baja), WrestleFest (09/19/2015 Bayamon).\nHall of Immortals.\nThe \"Salón de los Inmortales\" (Spanish for Hall of Immortals) is the WWL Hall of Fame.

It was won by Phil Taylor, with Jamie Lewis as the runner-up.\nAlso notable was the nine-dart finish hit by Ross Smith in his second round defeat by Adrian Lewis, which was the last nine darter to be hit in the PDC European Tour until June 2018.\nCourse of the event.\nPhil Taylor won his second European Tour title with a 6–1 victory over Jamie Lewis in the final. He had previously beaten Steve Beaton 6-0 in the last eight and Dave Chisnall 6-2 in the semi-finals, recording an average score of 112.73 in the former.

He told the Staffordshire newspaper \"The Sentinel\", \"It's fantastic to win this and I am over the moon. It's been a great weekend for me and I've really enjoyed it in Gibraltar.\"\nThe tournament's biggest surprise was Jamie Lewis' appearance in the final. He reached his first senior final after having to qualify to take part in the event, and was aiming to win one match and the £1,000 prize money, so that he would earn a place in the world top 64 and would avoid having to need to qualify for the 2014 PDC European Tour.\nThe event was the first-ever Gibraltar Darts Trophy, sponsored by the Government of Gibraltar at a reported cost of £100,000. Although it was not broadcast live, it was covered by Sky Sports. The trophy was presented by the territory's Sports Minister, Stephen Linares.

Additionally it was responsible for creating a code of conduct for tennis players and its subsequent enforcement via the administration of fines and suspensions.\nOn 30 August 1988, during the first day of the US Open, the ATP, dissatisfied with their lack of influence on how the sport was managed and marketed, announced its departure from the MIPTC (then renamed to MTC) and the creation of a separate ATP Tour from 1990 onward. As a result, the MIPTC was disbanded in 1989."

        "title": "2012–13 Division 1 season (Swedish ice hockey)",
        "text": "The 2012–13 Division 1 season in Swedish hockey was played from 12 September 2012 to 17 February 2013, with a number of playoff and promotion/relegation tournaments continuing until 27 March. The season resulted in IF Björklöven (which has previously played in the upper leagues of Swedish hockey) being promoted to the second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan.\nFormat.\nThe 56 participating teams played the first half of the season in six groups divided geographically. The successful teams then moved into three new groups (the Allettan groups), while the remaining teams played in a continuation of their smaller existing groups. The teams with the worst records in these continuation groups were then forced to defend their places in Division 1 against challengers from Division 2 (see \"relegation tournament\" below) in a round-robin tournament called \"Kvalserien till Division 1\". Meanwhile, the successful teams from the Allettan groups along with the group winners of the continuation groups played a playoff to determine who would have a chance to compete for promotion to the second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan in \"Kvalserien till HockeyAllsvenskan\".\nPromotion playoffs.\nThe top four teams from the Allettan groups, as well as the group winner in each of the continuation series, qualify for the playoffs. At the end of the playoffs there are four teams left, which get to participate in Kvalserien till HockeyAllsvenskan, which determines which clubs will play in Sweden's second-tier league HockeyAllsvenskan for the following season.\nThe Allettan group winners, along with the best-ranked second place team, skip to the third round. The remaining second place teams, plus one third place team enter in the second round. The remaining third and fourth place teams from the Allettan groups meet the winners of the continuation groups in the first round.\nAll of the playoff match-ups are best-of-three series with the lower seeded team starting with one game at home, followed by two games (if necessary) on the home ice of the higher-seed.\nKvalserien till HockeyAllsvenskan.\nJoining the Division 1 playoff winners (IF Björklöven, HC Vita Hästen, Huddinge IK and Piteå HC) in this tournament were the two teams from HockeyAllsvenskan with the worst records, Karlskrona HK and Tingsryds AIF. The teams played a double-round robin tournament called \"Kvalserien till HockeyAllsvenskan\", with the top two teams playing the 2013–14 season in HockeyAllsvenskan and the remaining four playing in Division 1.\nUmeå-based IF Björklöven, who were Swedish champions in 1987 and were in Sweden's top hockey league as recently as 2001, finished first in the standings, resulting in their return to HockeyAllsvenskan three years after their 2010 demotion to Division 1 due to financial difficulties.\nThe second and final spot in HockeyAllsvenskan was decided dramatically in the final round. Karlskrona went into the final round one point ahead of Tingsryd in the standings. Each team ended up losing their final match in game winning shots, resulting in Tingsryd being demoted to the 2013–14 Division 1 season.\nRelegation tournaments.\nThe worst teams from each continuation series play a relegation tournament called \"Kvalserien till Division 1\" with the winners from Division 2, in order to qualify for the 2013–14 Division 1 season.\nDivision 1 was contracted to 53 teams for the 2013–14 season. This, along with the fact that some clubs chose not to contest relegation, caused some situations where a team was relegated without a team being promoted, or vice versa.\nKvalserie A.\nKvalserie A resulted in Kalix UHC retaining their spot in Division 1, and Bodens HF being demoted to Division 2 for 2013–14.\nKvalserie B.\nFrom group B, Njurunda SK, who finished last in Division 1B's continuation round, elected to drop out of Division 1 prior to the start of Kvalserien. What resulted was a competition with two Division 1B teams (Brunflo IK and Kramfors-Alliansen) competing over a single Division 1 spot against two challengers from Division 2 (Husum HK and IFK Nyland). Kvalserie B ended with Brunflo IK in first place, successfully defending their position in Division 1, and with Kramfors-Alliansen being demoted to Division 2 for the 2013–14 season.\nKvalserie D.\nFrom group D, Järfälla HC opted not to defend their spot in Division 1 due to their financial situation, and thereby accepted relegation to Division 2. This meant that there was an open spot available in Division 1D for one of the challengers from Division 2, Bajen Fans IF, Haninge HF and Värmdö HC. Kvalserie D resulted in Bajen Fans IF (which the following off-season was renamed Hammarby Hockey) winning the group, thereby securing promotion, while Nacka HK came in second, thereby successfully defending their spot in Division 1."

        "title": "Rose Bowl (horse)",
        "text": "Rose Bowl (1972–1994) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from September 1974 until November 1976 she won six of her fourteen races and established herself as one of the best British race mares of the 1970s. After winning once as a two-year-old she won the Nell Gwyn Stakes on her first run in 1975 and then appeared to be a very unlucky loser of the 1000 Guineas. She returned from injury to show her best form in autumn, winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile and then defeated a top-class international field in the ten furlong Champion Stakes. She won a second Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and was narrowly beaten in the Champion Stakes in 1976, when her season was again disrupted by injury. She was then retired from racing and became a successful and influential broodmare.\nBackground.\nRose Bowl was a good-looking bay mare bred in Kentucky by the Engelhard family's Cragwood Estates. She was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Flying Water and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Rose Bowl's dam Roseliere was one of the leading fillies of her generation in Europe, winning the Prix de Diane and the Prix Vermeille. Timeform rated her the best three-year-old filly of 1968, with a rating on 127. Apart from Rose Bowl, Roseliere also produced the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Ile de Bourbon. Both Habitat and Roseliere were owned by Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. (1917–1971) and Rose Bowl raced in the colours of his widow Jane.\nThe filly was sent to Europe and was trained by Fulke Johnson Houghton at the Woodway Stable near Blewbury in Wiltshire.\nRacing career.\n1974: two-year-old season.\nRose Bowl, was an extremely late foal, being born on 24 May, and did not race until late September when she finished second in a race over six furlongs at York and then recorded her first success in the Harwell Maiden Stakes over five furlongs at Newbury. She was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket in October. She started a 25/1 outsider but exceeded expectations by finishing third behind Cry of Truth and Delmora. She was strongly fancied for the Group Three Cornwallis Stakes at Ascot later that month, but ran poorly, finishing fifth behind Paris Review. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, Rose Bowl was given a weight of 119 pounds, fourteen pounds behind the top colt Grundy and twelve pounds behind Cry of Truth.\n1975: three-year-old season.\nRose Bowl began her three-year-old season at Newmarket in the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Lester Piggott, she started the 7/4 favourite and won impressively by three lengths from Posy with Cry of Truth unplaced. On 1 May, over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket, Rose Bowl again started 7/4 favourite, but finished fourth behind Nocturnal Spree, Girl Friend and Joking Apart. Piggott had been unable to obtain a clear run on the favourite, who was boxed in on the rail and Rose Bowl appeared to have been an unlucky loser. The filly then sustained a muscle injury which kept her off the racecourse for almost three months.\nRose Bowl returned to racing in the Group One Sussex Stakes over one mile at Goodwood in which she was matched against colts and older horses. Ridden again by Piggott she finished second in a three-way photo-finish, a \"fast-diminishing\" neck behind the 2000 Guineas winner Bolkonski and a short-head in front of the leading sprinter Lianga. A month later, over the same course and distance, she and Piggott finished second to Gay Fandango in a \"muddling race\" for the Waterford Crystal Mile, with Roussalka (winner of the Coronation Stakes and the Nassau Stakes) in third place.\nIn the autumn of 1975, Rose Bowl established herself as the outstanding filly in Europe. In September she ran in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile at Ascot. Ridden by Willie Carson as Piggott had chosen to ride Gay Fandango she started at odds of 9/2 in a field of five runners and won from Gay Fandango, Anne's Pretender and Bolkonski. In October, Rose Bowl was moved up in distance for the Group One Champion Stakes at Newmarket, in which she was matched against the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winners Allez France and Star Appeal. Ridden again by Carson, she won the race from Allez France with the Prix d'Ispahan winner Ramirez in third and Star Appeal unplaced.\n1976: four-year-old season.\nRose Bowl began her third season by finishing fourth in a blanket finish for the Prix Ganay and then won the second running of the Clive Graham Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood in May, easily beating Red Ransom and Anne's Pretender. On 15 June she was sent to Royal Ascot where she was injured when finishing third to the subsequently disqualified Trepan in the Prince of Wales's Stakes.\nIn autumn she returned to form to beat Ricco Boy and Dominion in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, becoming the second horse, after Brigadier Gerard to win the race twice. In the Champion Stakes she came close to a second repeat win, but finished second of the nineteen runners, a neck behind the winner Vitiges. On her final appearance, Rose Bowl was sent to the United States for the Washington, D.C. International. Racing over one and a half miles for the first time she failed to reproduce her best form and finished unplaced behind the French-trained three-year-old Youth.\nAssessment.\nIn 1975, the independent Timeform organisation gave Rose Bowl a rating of 133, making her the highest-rated three-year-old filly of the season: up to that time the only three-year-old fillies to have been rated more highly had been Coronation in 1949 and Petite Etoile in 1959. In their book, \"A Century of Champions\", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rose Bowl the sixteenth best British or Irish filly of the 20th century.\nStud record.\nOn her retirement from racing, Rose Bowl became a broodmare for the stud of Paul Mellon. She was consistently successful, producing at least eight winners:\nGolden Bowl produced the Prix Exbury winner Nero Zilzal, while Antigua Rose was the grand-dam of the Queen's Plate winner Strait of Dover. Rose Bowl's daughter Browser (by Nijinsky), produced the Athenia Handicap winner High Browser. Browser's full sister Crystal Cup produced Iktamal (Haydock Sprint Cup) and First Magnitude (Prix du Conseil de Paris)."

Points are gathered at sprint line performances as well as finishing the stage in the top-fifteen places.\nThere is also a mountains classification, which awards a red jersey. In the mountains classifications, points are won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb is categorized, either first, second, third, or fourth category, with more points available for the harder climbs.\nThere is also a youth classification. This classification is calculated the same way as the general classification, but only young cyclists (under 23) are included. The leader of the young rider classification receives a white jersey.\nThe last jersey is awarded to the most aggressive rider of a stage for him to wear on the next stage. It is generally awarded to a rider who attacks constantly or spends a lot of time in the breakaways. This jersey is orange.\nThere is also a classification for teams. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per stage are added, and the team with the lowest time is the leader."

Despite an extensive 17-year career in the minor leagues, many of them in Class A (the highest minor-league classification at the time), Taylor never played in a major-league game.\nTaylor is most known for being part of the Milwaukee Brewers' rise to prominence during the 1890s. A Class A team at the time, Milwaukee signed Taylor and several other talented players, some of whom were recommended by Taylor. The Brewers soon became a minor-league powerhouse, eventually becoming a major-league team in , although Taylor was no longer on the team.\nTaylor's best season was arguably 1897, when he compiled a .318 batting average over 116 games for the Toronto Canucks. In 1899, Taylor became manager of the Toronto club. In 1900, Taylor became manager of the Syracuse Stars and from 1901 to 1902, the manager of the Utica Pentups, which played in the New York State League. He played professionally until 1905, his last season with the New Bedford Whalers, when he produced a mediocre batting average of .239."

        "text": "The annual NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament is a college ice hockey tournament held in the United States by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to determine the top men's team in Division I. Like other Division I championships, it is the highest level of NCAA men's hockey competition. This tournament is somewhat unique among NCAA sports as many schools which otherwise compete in Division II or Division III compete in Division I for hockey.\nSince 1999, the semi-finals and championship game of the tournament have been branded as the \"Frozen Four\"—a reference to the NCAA's long-time branding of its basketball semi-finals as the \"Final Four\".\nHistory.\nThe NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Championship is a single elimination competition that has determined the collegiate national champion since the inaugural 1948 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament. The tournament features 16 teams representing all six Division I conferences in the nation. The Championship Committee seeds the entire field from 1 to 16 within four regionals of 4 teams. The winners of the six Division I conference championships receive automatic bids to participate in the NCAA Championship. The tournament begins with initial games played at four regional sites culminating with the semi-finals and finals played at a single site.\nIn setting up the tournament, the Championship Committee seeks to ensure \"competitive equity, financial success and likelihood of playoff-type atmosphere at each regional site.\" A team serving as the host of a regional is placed within that regional. The top four teams are assigned overall seeds and placed within the bracket such that the national semifinals will feature the No. 1 seed versus the No. 4 seed and the No. 2 seed versus the No. 3 seed should the top four teams win their respective regional finals. Number 1 seeds are also placed as close to their home site as possible, with the No. 1 seed receiving first preference. Conference matchups are avoided in the first round; should five or more teams from one conference make the tournament, this guideline may be disregarded in favor of preserving the bracket's integrity.\nBroadmoor Ice Palace in Colorado Springs, Colorado hosted the tournament for the first ten years and has hosted eleven times overall, the most of any venue. The Denver Pioneers have won the most tournaments with ten, while Vic Heyliger has coached the most championship teams, winning six times with Michigan between 1948 and 1956.\nThe 2020 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults.\n Participation in the tournament vacated by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.\nPerformance by team.\nThe code in each cell represents the furthest the team made it in the respective tournament:\nStarting in 2003, the 4 teams seeded No. 1 in the regions are shown with .\nTournament Droughts.\nThe following is a list of teams that have not made an NCAA tournament anytime in the last 10 seasons.\nAwards.\nAt the conclusion of each tournament both an all-tournament team and 'Most Outstanding Player in Tournament' is named. Both achievements have been in effect since the inaugural championship in 1948"

Following a twelve-year interruption, the tournament was resumed in 1993.\nDuring the 1982–1992 period in which no Division II championship existed, all Division II men's lacrosse programs were allowed by NCAA rules to compete as Division I members in that sport. Several D-II teams received invitations to the D-I tournament in this period, including Adelphi in 1982; C.W. Post in 1986; Adelphi again in 1987, where they upset Army; and Adelphi once more in 1989, where they received a number five seeding."

        "text": "The NCAA Fencing Championships are awarded at the annual tournament held in March to determine the NCAA's national collegiate individual and team championships in fencing. Individual champions are determined by performance during the NCAA fencing team championship competition. Unlike most NCAA sports, the fencing championship is a single National Collegiate championship rather than being split into divisions.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1990, separate men's championships were held, but since then, fencing has been a coed sport with teams having men's and women's squads, although some schools field only a women's team. Fencing is a single-division sport with schools from all three NCAA divisions competing against each other.\nFencing was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA conquered the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership.\nNCAA fencing follows the rules of the U.S. Fencing Association with several modifications.\nCriticism of coed model.\nAfter major publicity regarding the differences in facilities provided to participants in the 2021 Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, the NCAA commissioned the law firm Kaplan Hecker &amp; Fink to conduct a broad-based review of gender equity issues surrounding all of its championship events. The first phase dealt exclusively with Division I basketball; the second phase investigated all other NCAA championships, including fencing. In the second phase, both fencing stakeholders and NCAA staff identified a major gender inequity issue stemming from the NCAA's 1990 decision to combine the men's and women's team championships. As of the date of the report (the 2021–22 school year), no NCAA fencing programs fielded only a men's team, but many fielded only women's teams. Because the team champion is determined by combining each school's men's and women's points earned, and entry rules limit the number of participants of each sex per school and region, women-only teams cannot win the team championship. Some stakeholders have suggested that men's and women's team championships be reintroduced, either as substitutes for or supplements to the current coed championship. The NCAA's fencing committee has discussed this change, but it was still \"under consideration\" as of the report date."

        "text": "The NCAA women's gymnastics tournament is an annual gymnastics competition to determine the best collegiate women's gymnastics team in the country. Unlike most NCAA sports, the women's gymnastics championship is not separated into divisions and uses a single National Collegiate tournament instead.\nHistory.\nThe NCAA introduced women's gymnastics as a championship sport in 1982. Gymnastics was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA conquered the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership.\nUnder the NCAA, only seven universities have claimed the overall Division I (pre-1987) or National Collegiate (1987–present) championship; the Division II competition was discontinued in 1987. During the early years of competition, the University of Utah, under the leadership of head coach Greg Marsden, dominated the field of competition. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the University of Georgia (UGA), coached by Suzanne Yoculan, and the University of Alabama, coached by Sarah Patterson, gained success and claimed several titles. From 1996 to 2012, the University of Alabama, the University of Georgia, and UCLA, coached by Valorie Kondos Field, claimed all NCAA titles; four titles for the University of Alabama, six for UCLA and seven for the University of Georgia.\nIn 2013, the University of Florida, coached by Rhonda Faehn, broke the reign of the prior four teams, winning the NCAA tournament held at UCLA's newly renovated Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California. Faehn was a competitor for the Bruins 1990–1992. The University of Oklahoma, coached by K. J. Kindler, became the sixth team to win the NCAA title after tying with Florida in 2014. In 2021, the University of Michigan, coached by Bev Plocki, became the seventh team to win the NCAA title. In 2024, LSU, coached by Jay Clark, became the eighth team to win the NCAA title.\nGym Slam.\nA \"Gym Slam\" (sometimes spelled as \"GymSlam\") is the accomplishment of scoring a perfect 10.0 on each apparatus. Only 15 women in NCAA gymnastics have achieved this feat, 3 have achieved it at least twice, and Trinity Thomas is the only gymnast to have achieved this feat more than twice, completing it a total of 5 times."

        "title": "Kathryn Holloway (volleyball)",
        "text": "Kathryn S. \"Katie\" Holloway (born June 8, 1986) is an American Paralympic volleyballist.\nEarly life.\nHolloway was born in Everett, Washington, without a fibula in her right leg; because of this, her right foot and ankle needed to be amputated when she was 20 months old. In 2004, she graduated from Lake Stevens High School. During her high school years from 2000 to 2002 she competed in volleyball and from the same year till 2004 in basketball. In her spare time she enjoys scrapbooking and watching Friends.\nCareer.\nNot only was Holloway able to overcome this loss, she thrived after it. Early in her career in sports a rare skill was seen in her. By the time she graduated from Lake Stevens High School she had been recognized in both volleyball and basketball. Playing volleyball for two years and basketball all four. In 2002 and 2003 her basketball team went to the state championship, and it was then when she began being recruited by college basketball teams from all over the country. And when her team won the district championship things only got better for the young Holloway.\nEven knowing she had a prosthetic leg, offers still poured in. Once she graduated from Lake Stevens High, she went on to California State at Northridge, in southern California, where she majored in Sociology. While she attended she played for the Matadors in NCAA Division 1 basketball till 2008. During her time there she won awards which include, Big West Women of the year, and her freshmen year was put on the Big West freshmen team. In her senior year at Northridge she was averaging about 14.5 points and 7 rebounds during a game. It seemed nothing could hold this young star back from achieving her dreams.\nHer sister Chelsey Holloway also played Basketball in high school and later at Seattle University for the Red Hawks. The two sisters seem to share a common bond. Later in an interview with the Women’s Sports Foundation, Holloway was posed with a question: “Who is your hero?” She was quoted replying “My sister. She inspires me every day to be happy.” During her time in college not only did she compete with her college team but she was striving for more. Holloway also competed in several Sitting Volleyball tournaments. Sitting Volleyball is basically the same in every way to traditional volleyball, except for the fact that it is played like the name infers, while sitting. (\"Sitting volleyball rules,\" 2012) In the rules it says all players must have one buttocks of the floor while making contact with the ball in play. There are no guidelines as to what type of ailment makes you eligible to play in this new form of the sport. Amputees, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, brain injuries and strokes are just some of the conditions these players live with. All of whom are athletes by every definition of the word.\nStarting in 2006, Holloway competed in the Sitting Volleyball Championship in Roermond, the Netherlands placing in fifth. Every year following she competed and won several medals in the sport. In 2007, she won a silver medal, in the Sitting Volleyball Invitational which took place in Shanghai, China. The next year winning another medal, this time bronze, in a Sitting Volleyball tournament in Egypt. The next year Holloway decided to compete in two sports, she played basketball for the Matadors and the same year competed in the Paralympics in Beijing, China. In basketball she was named Second Team All Big West Conference, which was only over shadowed by her win at the Paralympics. Holloway and her team won silver in the US Women’s Sitting Volleyball in China that year. She would go on to win several more medals for Sitting Volleyball.\nIn 2009, she won a gold medal in the Euro-Cup, and would also be named Best Blocker in the games. She continued on her winning streak by winning a silver medal, U.S. Women’s Sitting Volleyball Team at the Sitting Volleyball Championship in Edmond, Oklahoma, the first medal she won on US soil. After taking a year off she returned to the sport with new ambition. After rigorous strength training and with the help of family and friends Holloway returned to the Paralympics. In 2012 Holloway and her teammates walked away with the silver medal for the U.S. Women’s Sitting Volleyball Team in London that year. They were beaten by The Republic of China for the gold.\nTeam USA competed at the World Championships in Elblag, Poland in June 2014. Holloway, as part of Team USA, have scored 24 points with 23 kills and 62 attacks. Therefore, she and her team won silver and had their closest finish ever against China in an international tournament, 23–25, 25–22, 19–25, 25–21, 17–15.\nHolloway was a member of the USA Paralympic women's volleyball team which won the gold medal at the 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto, at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, and at the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo."

        "text": "The 2013 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. A significant part of the Djokovic–Murray rivalry, it pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, against each other in a Grand Slam final for the fourth time.\nAfter three hours and nine minutes, second seeded Murray defeated World No. 1 Djokovic 6–4, 7–5, 6–4 to win the match. By winning the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win the Wimbledon title and the first Scottish man since Harold Mahony in 1896 to win the title. The match was watched by a peak television audience of 17.3 million in the UK on BBC One. In the United States, ratings dropped 35% from the 2012 final when Roger Federer defeated Murray, making it the second least watched final since 1996 (only ahead of 2010).\nThis was Djokovic's last defeat on Centre Court until his defeat by Carlos Alcaraz in the 2023 final.\nBackground.\nThe match took place on the final day of the 2013 edition of the 13-day Wimbledon Championships, held every June and July. These two players had been heavily favoured to meet in the final following the early round defeats of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, among others. Novak Djokovic was the top seed despite not being the defending champion, and was going for a second title at Wimbledon after winning in 2011, whilst Andy Murray, the second seed, was going for his first title after finishing runner-up to Federer the previous year. Both players had made it through their first four matches in straight sets, and both had to overcome tough five-set matches to make the final: Murray against Fernando Verdasco in the quarter-finals, against whom he dropped the first two sets, and Djokovic against Juan Martín del Potro, where he defeated the Argentine in the longest men's singles semifinal in Wimbledon history at the time, clocking in at 4 hours and 43 minutes.\nMatch.\nAndy Murray won the pre-match coin toss and chose ends, Novak Djokovic elected to serve first. Andy Murray then tested his serve early, earning three break points before Djokovic reeled off five consecutive points to take the opening game of the match. Murray then broke to take a 2–1 lead, but was immediately broken right back, after which Murray broke again to take a 4–3 lead. From there, neither player managed to break again in that set, with Murray serving out the set to love to take the first set 6–4.\nDjokovic then started to make a comeback as he broke to take a 4–1 lead in the second set, though Murray then won the next three games to level the set at 4–4. Murray broke once again at 6–5 and once again served an ace on set point to win the second set 7–5 and thus go two sets up.\nMurray then broke early to take a 2–0 lead in the third set, but then Djokovic won four games in a row to lead 4–2 on serve. Murray then broke again to keep the set on serve, and then held his subsequent service game to level the set at 4–all. Murray once again broke to take a 5–4 lead, thus putting himself in a strong position to serve for the championship. Murray served out to gain three championship points, but Djokovic saved all of them, thus forcing deuce. Djokovic then earned three separate break points, but Murray saved them all, the first through a huge first serve, the second through a cross-court forehand winner and the third through a forehand volley winner.

        "text": "The World Archery Rankings is a ranking system developed by the World Archery Federation for international competitive archery. It is calculated using a points system and published following major World Archery tournaments.\nThe ranking system was first developed in 2001, and calculation method updated in 2010. At present, rankings are maintained for:\nFrom 2006, rankings were calculated for Field Archery, but since 2012 are no longer maintained.\nCalculation.\nEach archer or team earns a ranking score for each competition. The ranking scores are calculated through a combination of the ranking factor of the tournament (\"Ranking Factor\") and points based on the competitor's final position in the competition (\"Ranking Score\"). The archer's four highest ranking scores are then combined to form their total score (\"Added Ranking Score\"), which forms the basis of the ranking list.\nRanking factor.\nOnly results achieved at official ranking events can count towards the overall rankings. These events include the major World Archery Federation tournaments (Olympics, World Archery Championships, World Cup), and other international, regional and national events that have applied and been approved for ranking status.\nThe tournament ranking factor is calculated on the basis of three sub-factors, Quality, Quantity and Period, which are multiplied together to produce the overall tournament factor. The factor can vary between disciplines at the same event (e.g., the recurve and compound disciplines at the World Championships may have different ranking factors).\nFor instance, the ranking factor of a tournament for individuals with 60 archers, of whom 10 are in the top 50, that took place 18 months ago, would be:\nQuality.\nThe Quality sub-factor takes into account the level of competition at the tournament. A score is assigned based on the prestige of the event, for the major World Archery Federation tournaments, and the number of top archers or teams at other competitions (defined as individuals ranked in the top 50 or teams ranked in the top 16). The quality factor points are assigned as follows:\nIndividual\nTeam\nQuantity.\nThe Quantity sub-factor assigns a score based on the number of archers competing as follows:\nIndividual\nTeam\nPeriod.\nThe Period sub-factor is dependent on when the competition took place, allowing the ranking factor to emphasise the most recent tournaments as follows:\nRanking Points.\nRanking Points are awarded based on the team or competitor's final position at the competition. This is then multiplied by the Ranking Factor to produce the overall Ranking Score for that team or competitor at that tournament. For instance, an archer who finished 4th in the competition used in the example above would receive the following Ranking Score:\n1.125 \"(\"Ranking Factor\")\" x\n12 \"(\"Ranking Points\": 4th place)\" =\n13.5\nA team or competitor's best four Ranking Scores are then combined to produce the Added Ranking Score, which forms the basis of the rankings list. No more than two Ranking Scores whose period factor is lower than 1 may be used to calculate the Added Ranking Score.\nRanking Points are awarded as follows:\nIndividual\nTeam\nCurrent rankings.\nRecurve.\nMen's individual recurve.\nRankings at 4 February 2024\nWomen's individual recurve.\nRankings at 4 February 2024\nMen's team recurve.\nRankings at 4 February 2024\nWomen's team recurve.\nRankings at 4 February 2024\nMixed team recurve.\nRankings at 4 February 2024\nCompound.\nMen's individual compound.\nRankings at 5 October 2023\nWomen's individual compound.\nRankings at 5 October 2023\nMen's team compound.\nRankings at 5 October 2023\nWomen's team compound.\nRankings at 5 October 2023\nMixed team compound.\nRankings at 5 October 2023\nNumber one ranked archers.\nThe following archers have achieved the number one individual position since the inception of the rankings in 2001:\nRecurve.\nMen\nWomen\nCompound.\nMen\nWomen"

        "title": "Katherine Bowling",
        "text": "Katherine Bowling (born 1955, Washington, D.C.) is a painter known for her layered landscape paintings that draw inspiration from nature in the Hudson Valley.\nEarly life and education.\nKatherine Bowling grew up in Tidewater, Virginia.\nShe received her BFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1978.\nPainting.\nBowling's first New York show, as well as her first solo exhibition, was in 1987.\nBowling's works tend to be landscape paintings that often feature woods and fields as well as roads.\nMany of her paintings are based on her photographs of woods and fields surrounding and in Scholarie County, where she rents a house. As Molly O'Neill notes in an essay on Bowling and her work, this area is \"fifty miles northwest of the vistas that inspired the Hudson River School painters in the mid-1800s.\"\nBowling focused in particular on the imagery of roads for the theme of her exhibition at Greenberg Van Doren, \"Divide\". As the title implies, writes Lilly Wei in the exhibition's accompanying catalog, Bowling views the roads as \"abstract marks in the landscape that divide and order space.\" Even with roads she has often traveled, Bowling finds something new on closer inspection that alters her perception of the familiar and mundane. Bowling explains that the roads \"function as a metaphor for memory and displacement.\"\nIn 2001, Bowling exhibited a number of seascape paintings. In her essay on the exhibition, art historian and critic Nancy Princenthal writes that, far from being an aberration from Bowling's typically home-based scenes, the ocean paintings are \"a return to childhood memories and life long inclinations. A native of Virginia, she spent her first summers at the Atlantic shore and on the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nPrimarily, however, Bowling's works focus on capturing the play of light and shadow. Art critic Eleanor Heartney notes that \"Her paintings, like those of Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir, focus on the ephemeral moment and the fleeting impression, conjuring the flicker of sunlight through the trees, the shifting shadows of early evening, the reflections of clouds and foliage glancing across the rippling surface of a lake.\"\nO'Neill argues that Bowling additionally \"has an innate sense of abstraction and she ranges happy as an uncaged chicken, pecking elements from the Impressionists' obsession with light; from modern photography; and the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock.\"\nBowling is influenced by the use of light in the paintings of European Romantics such as J. M. W. Turner and John Constable as well as by the later work of George Inness. Her paintings also recall landscapes by Claude Lorraine, Albert Pinkham Ryder and Camille Corot.\nProcess.\nBowling is known for her use of spackle. She uses a long process of layering and sanding to create the \"back-lit\" effect found in her paintings.\nFirst, the paintings begin as photographs which she typically takes near her rented house in the Hudson Valley. Then, she uses these photographs, which serve as her \"preliminary drawings,\" to aid in the painting process. She also paints from memory and direct observation.\nBowling paints on square panels of plywood. Bowling considers rectangular pieces to be too horizontal and rife of implications already of landscapes and horizons. She sometimes paints on one of these square and sometimes paints on several square panels together. The seams between these adjoined panels are left visible.\nNext, Bowling applies layers of spackle. O'Neill remarks that \"Inspired, perhaps, by her day job of painting houses, [Bowling] turned to more industrial media: damp vinyl spackle, a building compound that is applied to wooden panels to create a matte, fresco-like surface. Thinned oil pigments are poured, allowed to dry, and then the Sisyphean task of sanding begins.\" Initial layers generally correspond with the color of the light—varying from pinks, golds, blues, and oranges. Through this layering and sanding, she creates a luminous quality in her landscapes.\nDespite rigorous sanding, air bubbles within the spackle layers are revealed occasionally on the surface. Rather than disguise them, Bowling integrates them. Heartney writes that Bowling \"allows these irregularities to become part of the painting so that the viewer's perception of the play of light and shadow across the image cannot be separated from an awareness of surface itself.\"\nIn later stages of painting, Bowling stands above panels to throw, dribble, and splatter paint with a hair dryer, recalling the techniques of Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock.\nSolo exhibitions.\n2010\n2009 \n2007 \n2006\n2005\n2004 \n2001 \n1998 \n1996 \n1994 \n1992 \n1990\n1989 \n1988 \n1987 "

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Louis XIV (Bernini)",
        "text": "The Equestrian Statue of King Louis XIV is a sculpture designed and partially executed by the Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was originally brought to France to design a new facade of the Louvre, a portrait bust, and an equestrian statue. Bernini first discussed the project while in France in the mid-1660s, but it did not start until later in the decade, when back in Rome. It was not completed until 1684 and then shipped to Paris in 1685. Louis XIV of France was extremely unhappy with the result and had it placed in a corner of the gardens of the royal palace at Versailles. Soon after, the sculpture was modified by François Girardon and altered into an equestrian sculpture of the ancient Roman hero Marcus Curtius.\nHistory.\nInvitation.\nFor much of the 17th century, Bernini was regarded as the premier artist of the era, serving as the primary source of artistic works commissioned by Pope Urban VIII. As a result, Louis XIV invited him to come to France to work in the name of the French monarchy. Bernini accepted this invitation, traveling to Paris to construct an equestrian statue and a portrait bust, as well as a new façade of the Louvre.\nBernini in France.\nThe day after his arrival in Paris on June 3, 1665, Bernini concluded that the work that had been already done on the Louvre by Louis Le Vau, a French Classical Baroque architect who had been hired by Louis XIV, was inadequate, deciding instead to create his own designs, citing his own observations of palaces throughout his career. Bernini would eventually propose to abandon Le Vau’s ongoing project, instead insisting that he would provide the design details himself.\nBernini's first concept for the planned east façade, which placed a heavy emphasis on curved wings in the Italian style, was almost immediately rejected. Jean-Baptiste Colbert also stated that Bernini's plans to place the king's own room in the outwardly protruding central pavilion would be a noisy location due to its close proximity to the nearby street and foot traffic. Following the rejection of the first draft, Bernini sent in a second draft which too was rejected by Colbert, though unlike the first and the third drafts an image does not appear to have survived. The third and final draft, which had eliminated the curved wings that Bernini initially envisioned, was praised by Louis, who had held a formal ceremony to lay the cornerstone of the new facade. However, as soon as Bernini left France to return to Rome, Louis ordered the construction to stop.\nConstruction and creation.\nBernini followed French tradition creating equestrian statues of French kings in their own residences, with notable examples by Francois Mansart, Charles Perrault, and Pierre Cottard. Despite tradition, Bernini was the first in France to design an equestrian statue to be freestanding with a rearing horse rather than attached to building. The precedent for this was Pietro Tacca's sculpture of Philip IV in the garden of Buen Retiro (1642) in Madrid which had been considered to be the first equestrian monument displaying a rearing rider since antiquity. This emulation reflected the Franco-Spanish rivalry during the reign of King Louis XIV.\nIn many images that capture the likeness of Louis XIV, the principal component was the metaphor of Louis’ reign, the sun, which conforms to the tradition of the \"oriens augusti\", or “the rising of the august one”, a term that identifies a ruler with the sun. The sun was also one of many symbols for Pope Urban VIII, Bernini’s greatest patron. In his time serving Urban VIII, Bernini was involved in the design of a frescoed vault within the Barberini Palace in Rome in which Divine Wisdom appears with the symbol of the sun on her breast.\nTransportation and arrival in France.\nIn the fall of 1684, the statue was shipped from Civitavecchia, Italy by boat. In March 1685, the Statue arrived in Paris. The statue was then shipped to Versailles during August and September, arriving at the palace on October 1, 1685. By the ninth, the statue was placed in the orangerie, in one of the galleries there.\nReception.\nOn 14 November 1685, Louis XIV saw the statue for the first time in the orangerie, Marquis de Dangeau recorded that the king had resolved to remove the statue from the grounds and to destroy it. The statue, however, was not destroyed, but moved to another location on the main axis of the Orangerie, south of the pool. In September 1686, Bernini’s statue was displaced by Domenico Guidi’s \"La Renommee de Louis XIV\". The statue was moved to a location on the far side of the newly constructed Neptune Basin, the most northern point on the north-south axis of the Garden. It was placed on a high pedestal. This location was not one of obscurity, but of prominence.\nIn 1702, after the transformation from Louis XIV to Marcus Curtius, the Roman hero, the statue was moved to the end of the Lake of the Swiss Guards. The Statue was positioned near the pool, which symbolizes the abyss that Marcus Curtius throws himself into. Rather than being immediately rejected, the statue was placed in several areas of prominence over a 16-year period, before finally being placed on the far side of The Lake of the Swiss Guard at the opposite end of the palace grounds from the Basin of Neptune. \nUpon viewing the completed equestrian statue, Louis XIV had declared it to be an abomination and ordered it to be destroyed; however, he was later convinced by his courtiers to have it moved to a remote location within the palace grounds. As a result, it was placed at the end of the Lake of the Swiss Guards, completely separating the statue and the main palace grounds.\nIn spite of Louis's public rejection of the equestrian statue, its form inspired future royal portraits of the king, including a marble creation by Antoine Coysevox depicting Louis XIV on horseback which sits in the Salon of War at Versailles, making corrections to facial characteristics created by Bernini which the French king interpreted as a slight against him, creating a more somber expression and raising the forehead to a more 'suitable' height.\nAfter Bernini's visit.\nFollowing the failure of Bernini's stay in Paris, French attitudes toward Italian culture changed, a shift in attitude that for the first time since the Renaissance recognized that a national self-consciousness and self confidence north of the Alps had developed, an attitude that developed as a result of the rejection of the Italian Baroque and the popularization of French classicism, resulting in Bernini's redesign of the Louvre never rising above its foundations.\nCulmination of themes in Bernini's work.\nThe Vision of Constantine.\nIn his process to construct the equestrian statue, Bernini referred back to one of his earlier works, the \"Vision of the Emperor Constantine\", which began construction in 1654 and was completed in late 1669.\nThe equestrian statue of Louis XIV was designed with his earlier work on the equestrian monument of the emperor Constantine in Rome in mind, with both horses striking similar poses and neither riders holding reins or stirrups. Whereas Constantine's gestures were raised above him to convey the vision of the Holy Cross and God above him, the Sun King’s gestures are grounded to convey his mundane and non-divine power in an act that Bernini termed as an ‘act of majesty and command'.\nUnlike the statue of Constantine, the statue of Louis XIV had been carved from a single block of stone, to be 'the largest ever seen in Rome,\" according to early biographers.\nBust of Louis XIV.\nIn addition to the equestrian statue, Louis XIV commissioned Bernini to sculpt a portrait bust of himself. The bust was modeled on another Bernini had made ten years prior of Francesco d’Este, the Duke of Modena. Both include many similar features, including the lance jabot, the shoulder clad in armor, and a cloak that appears to be floating in the wind. The most notable similarity between the two busts is the use of drapery to 'conceal' the lower torso. Both of these busts, along with the Louis XIV equestrian statue are examples of the ways in which Bernini depicts power in the context of seventeenth-century absolute monarchies.\nA detail of Louis’s bust comes from an anecdote recorded by Domenico Bernini and was summarized by the historian Cecil Gould,“One of the visitors at this early stage [July 22] was the Marquis de Bellefonds, who said he would have liked to see some hair on the King’s forehead... Bernini’s comment on this occasion was that painters had the advantage over sculptors in being able... to depict hair on a forehead without obscuring it. This thought fired Bernini to attempt the impossible. A week after Bellefonds’ visit Chantelou noticed that Bernini had in fact added a lock of hair onto the forehead of the bust... The addition of this lock, of which Bernini was very proud, could only be achieved by cutting back all the upper part of the forehead except for the curl itself. This was later to be criticized adversely, and it did in fact falsify the shape of the King’s forehead.”The anecdote points out that Bernini was more concerned with the technical side of the bust rather than carving with accuracy to the king’s likeness. The alteration resulted in a change in brow shape that was considered to be ‘unflattering’.\nLater changes.\nRecutting.\nIn 1687, Francois Girardon was tasked with amending Berini's sculpture. When recut by Girardon the equestrian statue was re-purposed to depict Marcus Curtius, an ancient Roman hero. In his story, an abyss appeared in the middle of the Roman forum that only the sacrifice of Rome's greatest possession would close. As a result Curtius determined that Rome's most prized possession with the bravery of its soldiers and hurled himself into the abyss while riding his horse, closing it.\nGirardon, the director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and the governor of all royal commissions of sculpture, carved the head and the horse’s support, adding a helmet and flames while changing the face. This narrative was viewed as better fitting the contortions of the horse, which did not depict a high level of horsemanship. Bernini had opted for movement instead of poise which was not well received by Louis XIV\nTwo major elements were changed; the flowing hair at the back of Louis XIV’s head was converted into the casque of a crested helmet and the flags were converted into a mass of flames at the horse’s feet."

Only two players have been named MOP more than once, Jessie Vetter in 2006 and 2009, and Noora Räty in 2012 and 2013. In 2011 the MOP was awarded to multiple players for the first time when it was awarded to Meghan Duggan and Hilary Knight.\nThe 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result no tournament Most Outstanding Player was awarded."

He was the first to open a major with two rounds of 65 or better, and set a U.S. Open record for lowest 36-hole score at 130. From Germany, Kaymer was the first from continental Europe to win the U.S. Open and the fourth European winner in five years.\nVenue.\nThis was the third U.S. Open played at Pinehurst's No. 2 Course and first after the 2010 Coore &amp; Crenshaw restoration which stripped the course of all of its rough and returned it to its original design. The past champions were: Payne Stewart in 1999 and Michael Campbell in 2005. Designed by Donald Ross, the No. 2 Course opened in 1907 and also hosted the PGA Championship in 1936 and the Ryder Cup in 1951.

He led a group of four golfers, including 2010 champion Graeme McDowell, by three strokes. Only 15 players shot under-par rounds. Defending champion Justin Rose shot 72. The scoring average for the field was 73.23, more than three strokes over par.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 13, 2014\"\nMartin Kaymer recorded a second consecutive round of 65 (−5), establishing a new tournament record for lowest 36-hole score (130) and becoming the first player to open a major championship with two rounds of 65 or better. His six-stroke lead over Brendon Todd after 36 holes tied a tournament record previously set by Tiger Woods in 2000 and Rory McIlroy in 2011. 21 players shot under-par rounds and 13 players were under-par for the tournament. The cut was at 145 (+5) and 67 players made the cut including one amateur, 2013 U.S. Amateur winner Matt Fitzpatrick. The scoring average for the field was 72.89, just less than three strokes over par.\nAmateurs: \"Fitzpatrick (+4)\", Campbell (+6), Stewart (+6), Whitsett (+6), Wilson (+8), McNealy (+10), Shelton (+13), Goss (+14), McIver (+15), Grimmer (+17), Dorn (+19)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 14, 2014\"\nKaymer dropped back towards the field, shooting a 2-over-par 72 but still led by five strokes on a tougher scoring day. Erik Compton and Rickie Fowler shot the only sub-par rounds, both shooting 67 (−3) to move into a tie for second place. Only six golfers remained under-par for the tournament. The scoring average for the field was 73.82, almost four strokes over par.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 15, 2014\"\nKaymer shot a 69 in the final round to win by eight strokes over Compton and Fowler. His 72-hole score of 271 was the second-lowest in U.S. Open history. This was his second major championship and also made him the fourth European winner of the event in five years (after Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose) having previously had no European winners since Tony Jacklin in 1970. Eleven golfers shot under-par rounds but none in the last eight groups except Kaymer. Only three golfers finished under-par for the tournament. The scoring average for the field was 72.40, the lowest of any rounds.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nThis was the last U.S. Open for NBC Sports, which had televised the event for twenty consecutive years, 1995–2014. Starting in 2015, Fox Sports began a 12-year contract to televise the championship and other USGA events, which it ended early before the 2020 U.S. Open, where NBC regained coverage due to scheduling conflicts with Fox’s NFL and college football coverage caused by the tournament’s postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "title": "NCAA Division I women's ice hockey conferences and teams",
        "text": "The following is a list of NCAA women's collegiate ice hockey teams, and conferences they compete in, that compete for berths in the annual NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament. The championship has existed since the 2000–2001 season and conferences include the university teams of Divisions I and II of the NCAA.\nHockey East Association (HEA).\nHockey East (full name: Hockey East Association) is a college athletic conference which operates primarily in New England, and features men's and women's competition. While the men's side of the conference temporarily added Notre Dame, located in Indiana, from 2013-2017, the women's side has remained a New England-only organization. It has emerged as one of the top women’s ice hockey conferences in United States. Hockey East continues to send teams to the Frozen Four (the NCAA Tournament). \nCollege Hockey America (CHA).\nCollege Hockey America (CHA) is a women’s college ice hockey conference (it participates in the NCAA’s Division I as a hockey-only conference). The conference began as a men's hockey conference in 1999, and added women's competition in 2002. After several of its member schools dropped the sport or moved to other conferences, the men's side of CHA folded after the 2009–10 season. CHA remains in operation as a women-only conference, currently with six teams — three from Pennsylvania, two from New York state, and one from Missouri. The University of Delaware will join the CHA in the 2025-26 season.\nThe CHA conference champion currently receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Championship Tournament. The demise of the Robert Morris program after the 2020–21 season reduced CHA's membership to five, one fewer than the six required to qualify for an automatic bid. Under current NCAA rules, any conference with an automatic bid that drops below six members has two years to restore its membership to the required six before losing its automatic bid. This issue became moot when Robert Morris reinstated its program and rejoined CHA effective during the 2023–24 season.\nECAC Hockey.\nLocated in the northeastern United States, the ECAC Hockey has changed to meet the needs of the exploding collegiate sport as 24 teams have called ECAC Hockey home since the first regional championship was contested in 1984. Clarkson became the first non-WCHA team to win the national championship when it defeated the Minnesota Gophers in the 2014 Frozen Four, and has since won titles in 2017 and 2018.\nIt is the only NCAA Division I hockey conference whose members all field varsity men's and women's teams.\nNew England Women's Hockey Alliance (NEWHA).\nThe newest conference to receive NCAA Division I recognition in ice hockey is the New England Women's Hockey Alliance. The NEWHA formed in 2017 as a scheduling alliance between the sport's six then-existing National Collegiate (Division I/II) independents, all located in New England. Of these schools, Sacred Heart was the only one that played at the National Collegiate level before 2017, having competed as an independent since 2003. The other five charter members, which all began National Collegiate play in 2017, consisted of one Division I member (Holy Cross) and four Division II members (Franklin Pierce, Post, Saint Anselm, Saint Michael's). Holy Cross left after the first NEWHA season of 2017–18 to join Hockey East. Shortly before the 2018–19 season, the remaining five members formally organized as a conference and began the process of gaining full NCAA recognition.\nIn the meantime, LIU Brooklyn had announced that it would add women's ice hockey effective in 2019–20, and would join the NEWHA at that time. Shortly after this announcement, the school's parent institution, Long Island University, announced that it would merge the athletic programs of its two main campuses (Division I Brooklyn and Division II Post) into a single Division I program that would later be unveiled as the LIU Sharks.\nWith the conference membership returning to six for 2019–20, the NCAA officially approved the NEWHA as a Division I conference shortly before the start of that season. This action also meant that there would be no independent programs in that season, since the NEWHA membership included all of the previous National Collegiate independents. The NEWHA received its first automatic NCAA tournament berth in 2021–22. Stonehill had originally planned to begin varsity play in the 2021–22 season as the NEWHA's seventh member, but due to recruiting issues brought on by COVID-19 delayed its debut until the 2022–23 season.\nAnother D-II school, Assumption, joined the NEWHA for administrative purposes alongside Stonehill in 2022–23, but did not start varsity play until 2023–24.\nWestern Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).\nThe Western Collegiate Hockey Association operates over a wide area of the Midwestern and Western United States. It participates in NCAA Division I as a women's hockey-only conference. Apart from the three titles won by Clarkson, every other National Collegiate women's title has been won by a WCHA team.\nAlthough the men's side of the WCHA was heavily affected by conference realignment in 2013, the women's side of the conference remained intact. After seven of the then-current 10 members of the men's WCHA left the conference after the 2020–21 season to reestablish the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, the WCHA disbanded its men's division and now operates as a women-only league."

        "title": "2013 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2013 Tour de France was the 100th Tour de France. It ran from 29 June 2013 to 21 July 2013, starting in the city of Porto-Vecchio in Corsica, with the island hosting the first three stages. Corsica was the only Metropolitan region, and Corse-du-Sud and Haute-Corse were the only Metropolitan departments, through which the Tour had never previously passed and the organisers wanted to combine the 100th edition of the Tour with the Tour's first ever visit to Corsica.\nThe opening stage was a standard road stage rather than the more usual Individual time trial or \"Prologue\".\nTo accommodate the tour entourage during their stay in Corsica, the organisers chartered the \"Mega Smeralda\" cruiseferry to house members of the organisation, media and others who work on the Tour and to host press conferences, although the riders stayed in hotels in and around Porto-Vecchio.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage of the race was a relatively flat stage on the east coast of Corsica and was expected to end with a sprint finish, with Mark Cavendish looking to claim the sprint and with it the maillot jaune for the overall race leader.\nThe Tour started out inauspiciously for top favourite Chris Froome of , as he crashed in the neutralised area before the true beginning of the stage although he was not hurt. Once the flag came down to signal the true beginning of the stage, five riders immediately distinguished themselves as the day's principal escape group – Jérôme Cousin of , 's Juan José Lobato, rider Lars Boom, Juan Antonio Flecha representing , and Cyril Lemoine from . The peloton did not allow them very much lead, as the mostly -paced main field kept the time gap between two and three minutes for the majority of the stage. The fourth-category Cote de Sotta came at the mark in the stage, the only climb on the day's parcours. This meant that the first rider, from the breakaway, over the line would be the first holder of the polka-dot jersey. It was Lobato who crossed first, beating out Cousin and Boom, and Lobato pulled on the climber's jersey at day's end.\nAt that point the breakaway sat up (stopped riding hard) and attempted to rejoin the peloton behind them, since the stage's flat profile (and its prestige) meant it was extremely unlikely they could stay away for victory. The time gap got to as little as 39 seconds before eventually getting as high again as four minutes. After both the break and the peloton had passed through the feeding station, it was again reduced to 40 seconds. Four of the riders again looked to sit up and abandon their efforts, but Cousin continued to ride, and eventually so did the whole breakaway group. For these efforts, Cousin was awarded the daily combativity award at stage's end. The time gap then got as large as four minutes, allowing the breakaway to contest the intermediate sprint as well. This one went to Boom ahead of Flecha. A few minutes later, three of the Tour's top sprinters André Greipel, Mark Cavendish, and Peter Sagan sprinted for the points available to them, coming across the line in that very order. The breakaway were at last caught with remaining in the stage, and the teams set up for the anticipated sprint finale.\nIt was about this time that reports came through of a problem at the finish line – a bus for the team had become stuck under the finishing arch. It was too tall to pass through. It disrupted the electronic timing for the stage, but the more pressing problem was the fact that the finish line was not clear to be covered by the cyclists. Race officials tried to extricate the bus, having no success for several minutes as the riders came nearer and nearer to the finish line. As the peloton passed through the to go mark, the decision was sent out over race radio for the finish line to be moved to the banner representing to the (original) finish line. Around this same time, the day's first major crash occurred, sending, among numerous others, 2012 Giro d'Italia champion Ryder Hesjedal off his bicycle. At approximately to go the original finish, meaning to go the revised finish line, teams such as and had begun their leadouts.\nIt was at this point that the bus was successfully removed from under the finishing arch, so race officials chose to move the stage finish back to the original finishing line. Also at this point, a crash of tremendous scope thinned the possible stage winners substantially, as sprinters Sagan, Cavendish, and Matthew Goss all either fell themselves or were caught behind the crash. Greipel, for his part, managed to stay upright and at the front of the race through both crashes, but a mechanical issue ended his chances at a stage victory and a yellow jersey. His German compatriot, 24-year-old Marcel Kittel from the team, was the rider who profited from the day's chaos and took stage honours, with the yellow, green, and white jerseys to go with it. No time gaps were taken on the stage – all 197 other riders in the field were given the same time as Kittel. Along with sprinters who missed out on the possibility at a stage win, some overall contenders and noteworthy stage-hunters also crashed. Alberto Contador crashed, and while his injuries were not severe enough to force him to retire from the race, he did express concern that they might keep him from being able to ride in optimal position for the upcoming team time trial. Tony Martin and Ted King sustained perhaps the worst injuries of anyone; Martin sustained a concussion and a lung contusion to go along with soft tissue damage and a deep shoulder wound, and King suffered a badly bruised and possibly broken shoulder. Tejay van Garderen, Philippe Gilbert, Gert Steegmans, Janez Brajkovič, Tony Gallopin, and Murilo Fischer all also crashed. Geraint Thomas also crashed, suffering a hairline fracture to his pelvis in the incident.\nAfter the stage, Cavendish, rider Greg Henderson, and team boss Marc Madiot all expressed their displeasure with race officials for moving the finish back to the original line while the teams were at sprint speed racing for the supposed finish at the banner. Henderson's criticisms focused on the effects the rapid changes had on the competitive aspect of the race, while Cavendish and Madiot were more concerned with how they affected rider safety. were fined 2,000 Swiss francs for \"not respecting the timetable put in place for auxiliary team vehicles arriving at the stage finish\" as a result of the incident. For his part, stage winner Kittel claimed not to have heard the instructions over race radio for the revised finish at the banner, which would seem to have played a part in his being focused to ride hard for the original finish line and take the day's honours.\nStage 2.\nThe tour crossed the island to Ajaccio on the west coast, with four ranked climbs including the Category 2 Col de Vizzavona () after and a Category 3 climb before the finish.\nThe day started with an opening attack within the opening kilometre and the formation of the day's breakaway by the mark. The break consisted of Rubén Pérez of , 's Lars Boom, rider David Veilleux, and Blel Kadri for and expanded their lead to three minutes in the first hour of racing. Boom crossed the intermediate sprint point ahead of his breakaway compatriots, while André Greipel () lead the peloton across the same point, beating 's Peter Sagan. The four breakaway riders started the climb of the Col de Bellagranajo with a 1' 50\" advantage that was cut to a 1' 00\" advantage at the summit of the climb.\nVeilleux and Kadri broke away from their companions at the start of the second climb while Veilleux's team-mate Thomas Voeckler attacked from the peloton, but was quickly brought back. At this point, a gruppetto was forming which included the yellow jersey Marcel Kittel () as well as the other top sprinters in the tour. Pierre Rolland attacked from the peloton and was followed by 's Brice Feillu. Rolland passed the breakaway riders and crossed the summit first, but was caught by the peloton on the col de Vizzavona after a concerted effort from and . On the final climb of the day, separate attacks were made by 's Cyril Gautier, Chris Froome (), and Juan Antonio Flecha of ; each of which was unsuccessful. With to go, Sylvain Chavanel () attacked and was joined by 's Jan Bakelants, rider Gorka Izagirre, Manuele Mori for , 's Jakob Fuglsang, and Flecha. The leading peloton picked off members of the breakaway one by one, until only Bakelants remained. Bakelants finished across the line a second in front of Sagan, earning himself his first Tour stage victory and the yellow jersey.\nStage 3.\nThe third and final day on Corsica saw the race return northwards again along the rugged west coast with several small climbs including the short but steep climb of the Category 2 Col de Marsolino (), before the finish in Calvi. Simon Gerrans won the stage.\nStage 4.\nThe first stage on mainland France was a team time trial, in which each team's time was taken when their fifth rider crosses the line. The race commenced in the Jardin Albert I and looped around the streets of Nice until reaching the Promenade des Anglais after . The route then followed the seafront for before turning north at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport to follow the Var valley. The intermediate time check came at , after which the race turned south and returned via the Promenade des Anglais to the Jardin Albert I.\nAmerican cyclist Ted King, who was nursing a shoulder injury, was controversially eliminated from the tour after riding on his own using a standard road bike (rather than a time trial bike) and finishing seven seconds outside the cutoff time. Many felt that race officials should have taken account of his courage in completing the stage and allowed him to continue the tour.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage took the riders westwards through Provence, crossing four small categorised climbs before reaching the port of Marseille, finishing at Parc Borély, to the south of the city centre. Mark Cavendish won the stage which was the 24th Tour de France stage victory of his career.\nStage 6.\nThe race continued westwards through southern France into Languedoc. The stage was won by André Greipel in a sprint finish.\nStage 7.\nThis stage took the riders north-west through the Monts de Lacaune including the climbs of the Col des 13 Vents (\"The Pass of 13 Winds\") and the Category 2 Col de la Croix de Mounis (). After passing the town of Lacaune, the race dropped down over two smaller climbs before the finish in the World Heritage Site city of Albi. Peter Sagan won the stage in a sprint finish.\nStage 8.\nAfter of flat to start, Stage 8 featured the first mountains of the tour, including the Hors catégorie climb of the Port de Pailhères which, at , is the highest point reached on the 2013 Tour. The first rider to cross the summit, 's Nairo Quintana won the Souvenir Henri Desgrange. The finish was at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort, at , with the final climb covering and rising at an average gradient of 8.6%. The final climb saw the GC contenders come to the front in this tour's first battle for the maillot jaune.\nJohnny Hoogerland () attacked as soon as the flag was dropped and was quickly joined by three other riders: Jean-Marc Marino (), Christophe Riblon (), and Rudy Molard (). The group opened a gap of roughly nine minutes over the flatter two-thirds of the course and crossed through the sprint point at . Back in the peloton, André Greipel () took the sprint honors ahead of Peter Sagan () and Mark Cavendish ().\nThe race soon reached the base of the Port de Pailhères with the leading group only holding an advantage of under two minutes. Hoogerland attempted to break away from his companions at the to go mark before being brought back. Riblon then launched an attack of his own and built a sizable lead over his former escape companions. Robert Gesink () was the first rider to attack from the peloton and was followed by an attack from Thomas Voeckler (). At this point, yellow jersey holder Daryl Impey () was dropped.\nQuintana launched his own attack with to go; quickly catching and passing Voeckler, Gesink, and Riblon. Pierre Rolland () and Igor Antón () attempted to follow, but Quintana built and advantage of 55 seconds over the chasing group at the top of the climb. Rolland would catch Quintana on the bottom of the descent, but was quickly dropped as the riders began the ascent up to Ax 3 Domaines. Riders were continuously shelled from the back of the chasing group until only five riders remained with under to go: riders Chris Froome and Richie Porte, Quintana's team-mate Alejandro Valverde and pairing Alberto Contador and Roman Kreuziger. Porte and Froome, having built a small gap over the other three riders, soon caught Quintana; thus prompting Froome to launch an attack of his own up the mountain. Froome gradually built a larger advantage all the way to the finish line and into the yellow jersey. Behind, Valverde attempted to chase after Froome, before being passed by Porte who comfortably rode into second place. Contador and Kreuziger struggled behind and were passed by duo Bauke Mollema and Laurens ten Dam, and 's Mikel Nieve.\nStage 9.\nThe second stage in the Pyrenees saw the race cross the Category 2 Col de Portet d'Aspet () soon after the start, followed by four Category 1 climbs: Col de Menté (), Col de Peyresourde (), Col de Val Louron-Azet () and La Hourquette d'Ancizan (). This is a \"roller-coaster\" stage.\nFollowing Froome and Team Sky's dominating performance at Ax 3 Domaines, Movistar and Garmin attacked from the early stages. Although Chris Froome was able to follow the attacks, Richie Porte's efforts caused him to be dropped by the leaders and eventually lose 10 minutes. As a result, Froome was left isolated for the majority of the stage, having to hold off several attacks from Nairo Quintana on the final climb. A late attack on the final climb by Jakob Fuglsang and Dan Martin was allowed to escape, and the Irish rider held off Fuglsang to win the stage. The rest of the leading riders, minus Porte, finished in a group behind Martin."

It ran from 29 June 2013 to 21 July 2013, starting in the city of Porto-Vecchio in Corsica.\nStage 13.\nThe 13th stage saw a big change in the general classification due to crosswinds leading to the formation of echelons. A 15-man group led by Alberto Contador's Team Saxo Bank, with the help of eventual stage winner Mark Cavendish's Omega Pharma–Quick-Step and Bauke Mollema's Belkin Pro Cycling used the crosswinds to make a gap with other General Classification riders 31 kilometers from the finish to form the echelons. Then again This helped Contador gain 1'09\" on – among others – Chris Froome, Nairo Quintana and Joaquim Rodríguez. The biggest victim however was the number 2 in the General Classification at that point: Alejandro Valverde. He lost 9'54\" after having a puncture at a critical point in the race. The stage saw escapees Bauke Mollema move to second, Alberto Contador to third, Roman Kreuziger to fourth, Laurens ten Dam to fifth and Jakob Fuglsang to sixth in the General Classification. Chris Froome retained the yellow jersey, while Alejandro Valverde dropped to 16th.\nStage 18.\nThe queen stage of the 2013 Tour de France saw the riders contest six categorised climbs on the day: the Col de Manse, the Rampe du Motty, the Col d'Ormon, the first ascent of the Alpe d'Huez, the Col de Sarenne, and finally a second ascent up Alpe d'Huez.\nThe day began with a breakaway of nine riders at around the mark and consisted of the following riders: Jens Voigt (), Arnold Jeannesson (), Christophe Riblon (), Andrey Amador (), Sylvain Chavanel (), Lars Boom (), Tom Danielson (), Tejay van Garderen (), and Moreno Moser (). By the mark, they had extended their advantage over the peloton to 5' 40\". Van Garderen would attack his leading companions at the foot of the first ascent of Alpe d'Huez, with only Moser and Riblon able to keep pace and caught up with him away from the top of the climb. Despite multiple mishaps – van Garderen's chain fell on the descent of the Sarenne and Riblon went off the road – the three leaders were firmly in the lead at the base of the second climb of Alpe d'Huez. Once again, van Garderen attacked at the base of the climb and quickly distanced himself from his leading companions. Riblon, despite being down 40 seconds to van Garderen at one point, would claw his way back up and passed him with to go, and ultimately won the only stage by a French rider in the 2013 Tour.\nBack in the peloton, major changes were occurring in the general classification. riders Bauke Mollema and Laurens ten Dam both cracked at the beginning of the climb and slid a couple of places on the leaderboard. Nairo Quintana () attacked the group and was followed closely by 's Chris Froome and Richie Porte as well as 's Joaquim Rodríguez. The trio of Alberto Contador, Roman Kreuziger, and Michael Rogers were unable to follow and would lose significant amounts of time. With to go, Froome and Porte would lose contact with Quintana and Rodríguez; at which point Porte dropped back to the team car to illegally get energy gels for his leader, then paced him to the end of the climb to limit his losses to Quintana and Rodríguez. Porte and Froome each received a 20-second time penalty and a fine of 200 Swiss francs for the infringement."

        "text": "The Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) is an all-volunteer initiative formed in October 2012 with the intention of providing professional boxing with authoritative top-ten rankings, identifying the singular world champion of every division by unbiased reasoning and common sense, and to insist on the sport's reform. Board members are independent professional journalists, boxing historians and record keepers from around the world. Their rankings and titles are meant to be uninfluenced by promoters and the traditional sanctioning bodies' paid-for \"alphabet belts\".\nTBRB championships.\nThe TBRB only awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet, and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" in each weight class. It also presents the \"successions\" of these championship \"thrones.\"\nThree of its recognized champions were identified by \"The Ring\" magazine before the TBRB was founded. Thus, the TBRB was formed in order to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of the latter's purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007, and the following dismissal of the editorial board headed by Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the \"Ring\" Advisory Panel resigned. These three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the TBRB, which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nThe group also maintains a pound for pound list which, as of August 2023, is currently topped by Terence Crawford and official \"monthly rankings\" for record keepers and boxing historians.\nESPN boxing analyst and commentator Teddy Atlas praised the TBRB's efforts on-air in March 2013 and again during the season finale in August 2013. Several sites have adopted their rankings, including Boxing.com, The Queensberry Rules, The Sweet Science, East Side Boxing, Esquina Boxeo and Stiff Jab.\nBritish magazine Boxing News announced in 2021 that it would only recognize world champions as voted by the TBRB.\nTBRB Voting Panel members.\nThere are currently 52 members representing 21 countries on six continents: the United States, England, Italy, the Philippines, Ireland, Chile, Cuba, Costa Rica, Scotland, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Norway, Sweden, Japan, Thailand, Australia, Argentina, Russia and Ghana.\nSuccessions.\nThe following are the lineal champions recognized by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board:\nHeavyweight\nCruiserweight\nLight heavyweight\nSuper middleweight\nMiddleweight\nSuper welterweight\nWelterweight\nSuper lightweight\nLightweight\nSuper featherweight\nSuper bantamweight\nBantamweight\nSuper flyweight\nFlyweight"

        "text": "James Jacob Nelson (born June 5, 1989) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nAmateur career.\nNelson attended Niceville High School in Niceville, Florida. The Cincinnati Reds selected Nelson in the 39th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign with the Reds. He attended the University of Alabama, and played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. In 2010, his junior year, he had a 9–3 win–loss record with a 4.01 earned run average (ERA) in 18 games (17 starts).\nProfessional career.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers selected Nelson in the second round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft.\nNelson started the 2013 season with the Double-A Huntsville Stars. He was promoted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds on June 5. He was promoted to the majors on September 3, made his debut on September 6, and made his first major league start on September 28.\nPrior to the 2014 season, Nelson was rated the Brewers' top prospect and 96th best prospect in baseball by Baseball America. Nelson began 2014 back at Triple-A Nashville, and dominated the Pacific Coast League to the tune of a 10–2 record, 1.46 ERA, and 114 strikeouts. Nelson was even named 2014 PCL Pitcher of the Year. He made one spot start for Milwaukee against the Miami Marlins due to a minor injury suffered by Yovani Gallardo on May 25, and recorded his first major league win, pitching scoreless innings with 3 walks and 6 strikeouts.\nOn July 10, Nelson was recalled again to join the starting rotation in place of the home run-prone Marco Estrada. He got his first career base hit during his July 17 start. Nelson sustained an injury on September 17 against the St. Louis Cardinals when Tommy Pham hit a line drive that ricocheted off his head. Nelson was able to leave the field in his own ability, and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a contusion. In 2015 he had an ERA of 4.11 and shared the major league lead in hit batsmen, with 13.\nIn 2016 he had an ERA of 4.62 and shared the major league lead in hit batsmen, with 17.\nOn September 8, 2017, Nelson suffered an apparent shoulder injury while sliding to first base, and left the game. The next day, on September 9, it was revealed that he was diagnosed with a right rotator cuff strain and a partial anterior labrum tear, meaning that he would take no further part in any action for the remainder of the 2017 season. Nelson finished the 2017 year with a 12–6 record, 199 strikeouts, and a 3.49 ERA.\nOn December 2, 2019, Nelson was non-tendered and became a free agent.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn January 7, 2020, Nelson signed a one-year, $1.25 million, contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers that also included an option for 2021. On July 6, it was announced that Nelson would undergo surgery on his lower back and would miss the entire season.\nOn October 30, 2020, the Dodgers declined their team option on Nelson's contract for the season, making him a free agent without having thrown a pitch for the organization. On December 11, 2020, Nelson re-signed with the Dodgers on a minor league contract. On March 25, 2021, Nelson was selected to the 40-man roster. Nelson pitched in 28 games for the Dodgers with a 1–2 record and a 1.86 ERA with 44 strikeouts and only 13 walks but he was unable to remain healthy. He missed 18 games with forearm inflammation and another 14 with a left lumbar strain before he was shutdown in early August when it was determined that he would need both Tommy John surgery and a flexor tendon repair in his right arm.\nOn March 15, 2022, Nelson signed a one-year contract to return to the Dodgers, which contained a club option for the 2023 season. He remained on the injured list all season and the Dodgers declined his option following the season on November 8. \nOn February 16, 2023, Nelson re-signed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $1.2 million contract plus bonuses. However, he again remained on the injured list all season.\nScouting report.\nNelson throws four pitches. He relies primarily on his sinker (95 mph), fourseam fastball (94 mph) and slider (84 mph). He also occasionally throws a change up (88 mph).\nPersonal life.\nNelson is a Christian. Nelson married longtime girlfriend Melissa Conway on December 10, 2016, in Nashville, Tennessee. They have twin daughters."

        "title": "2004 Wales rugby union tour of Argentina and South Africa",
        "text": "In June 2004, the Wales national rugby union team toured Argentina and South Africa. They played two test matches against the Argentina national team in Buenos Aires, losing 50–44 in the first on 12 June before winning the second 35–20 on 19 June, before playing the South Africa national team on 26 June 2004, losing 53–18 in Pretoria on 26 June. Before leaving for the tour, they also played an uncapped match against the Barbarians at Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol, winning 42–0. The tour saw call-ups for three uncapped players for Wales – Barry Davies, Peter Sidoli and Jason Forster – but only Forster played in any of the three games, scoring Wales' second try in the first test against Argentina.\nSquads.\nWales.\nWales coach Mike Ruddock, leading the nation for the first time following the departure of Steve Hansen at the end of the 2004 Six Nations Championship, named a 33-man squad for the tour. Hooker Barry Williams retired from international rugby at the start of May 2004, and several players were unavailable due to injury, including lock Robert Sidoli, scrum-half Gareth Cooper, hooker Robin McBryde and fly-half Stephen Jones, which meant a less experienced squad was named for the tour, and there were call-ups for the uncapped lock Peter Sidoli, flanker Jason Forster and full-back Barry Davies. Prop Darren Morris was also recalled to the squad almost three years after his last cap for Wales. Following the withdrawal of Craig Morgan from the squad with leg injuries, Tal Selley was called up in his place. Prop Iestyn Thomas also pulled out with a shoulder injury and was replaced by Rhys Thomas. After suffering an ankle injury in the pre-tour match against the Barbarians, Gareth Thomas had hoped to join up with the squad in time for the second test against Argentina; however, he did not recover in time for that match.\nArgentina.\nArgentina named a 26-man squad on 17 May 2004 for the two-test series against Wales and a one-off test against New Zealand. It was Argentina's first international action since they were eliminated in the group stage of the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Agustín Pichot, Ignacio Corleto, Juan Martín Hernández, Rimas Álvarez Kairelis and Mario Ledesma all withdrew to take part in the 2003–04 Top 16 play-offs with their respective clubs.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa were playing two home tests against Ireland and one against Wales. Like Argentina, these were South Africa's first internationals since the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They were also the team's first matches under new head coach Jake White, who replaced Rudolf Straeuli after the World Cup. The South Africa management had been criticised for only selecting one non-white player, Ashwin Willemse, for the World Cup quarter-final against New Zealand. On 16 May 2004, they named six black players in their 22-man squad to begin the summer; in addition to Willemse, they also called up Eddie Andrews, Bolla Conradie, Quinton Davids, Wayne Julies and Hanyani Shimange. Full-back Percy Montgomery was also named despite breaking his hand while playing for the Newport Gwent Dragons two days before the squad was announced.\nResults.\nWales vs Barbarians.\nWales' first match of the summer saw them warm up for their southern hemisphere tour with their fourth meeting with the Barbarians in as many years, played at Ashton Gate in Bristol on 26 May. Fly-half Ceri Sweeney scored all of Wales' points in the first half, converting his own try and adding two penalties to give them a 13–0 lead. Gareth Thomas, Rhys Williams, Dwayne Peel, Gavin Henson and Hal Luscombe all scored tries in the second half, with Sweeney adding two further conversions, while the defence stood firm to keep a clean sheet; it was the first time the Barbarians had failed to score in a match since 1978. Thomas suffered an ankle injury during the game that meant he had to be substituted after an hour, putting him in doubt for the tour.\nArgentina vs Wales (1st test).\nWales coach Mike Ruddock made just one change to the team that started the match against the Barbarians, as Hal Luscombe came in on the right wing for Rhys Williams, who was filling in for the injured Gareth Thomas at full-back. Meanwhile, Jason Forster retained his position in the back row to earn his first full cap at the age of 33, while 35-year-old lock Gareth Llewellyn surpassed Neil Jenkins as Wales' most-capped player with 88 international appearances. Argentina's selection was affected by the release of five players back to their French clubs in order to appear in the Top 16 championship play-offs, including captain Agustín Pichot. Number 8 Gonzalo Longo replaced Pichot as captain, while uncapped forwards Pablo Cardinali and Martín Schusterman were named on the bench.\nLongo scored the only try of the first half, combining with Felipe Contepomi's four penalties to give Argentina a 19–9 lead at the break. The hosts opened up an unassailable lead early in the second half, however, thanks to a trio of unanswered tries: two from Lucas Borges and another from Contepomi. Dwayne Peel scored a breakaway try for Wales, but Martín Gaitán restored Argentina's lead. Forster pulled Wales back with a debut try shortly after, only for Manuel Contepomi to again push Argentina seemingly out of reach. But with just over 10 minutes to play, Colin Charvis sparked a flurry of Welsh scores, with Sonny Parker and Luscombe following suit to reduce the deficit to six points. On the last play of the game, Shane Williams made a line break and played an inside pass to Parker, only for the centre to knock on, confirming an Argentine victory.\nArgentina vs Wales (2nd test).\nWales brought in four new faces for the second test: Huw Bennett and Dafydd Jones in the forwards, and Nicky Robinson and Tom Shanklin in the backs. Bennett and Shanklin came in for Mefin Davies and Rhys Williams, who had been ill in the week; both were thought to have recovered in time to be named as substitutes, but Williams was ultimately left out in favour of Barry Davies. Ceri Sweeney, whom Robinson replaced, was also named on the bench, but Jason Forster was left out altogether despite a try-scoring debut the previous week. There were two positional changes in the starting XV as Colin Charvis moved from blindside to openside and Gavin Henson moved from inside centre to full-back. Argentina made two changes to their starting line-up, as centre José Orengo replaced Martín Gaitán, who had suffered a groin injury, and Nicolás Fernández Miranda returned from domestic duty with his club, Petrarca.\nShane Williams scored a first-half hat-trick of tries, two of which were converted by Henson. He also scored two penalties to give Wales a 25–0 lead at half-time, aided by Ignacio Fernández Lobbe's yellow card for coming in at the side of a ruck. After the break, Charvis was sin-binned for the second week in a row for killing the ball, resulting in Hernán Senillosa kicking Argentina's first points of the game. This was soon followed by their opening try, scored by Federico Martín Aramburú and converted by Senillosa. Omar Hasan reduced the deficit to 10 points with another try following a turnover from a Wales line-out in Argentina territory, but another Henson penalty and a try from Nicky Robinson put Wales 20 points up again. Shane Williams was yellow-carded late on for killing the ball, and Lucas Borges completed the scoring with a try awarded after video review.\nSouth Africa vs Wales.\nAhead of the South Africa test, Ruddock sought advice from the Ireland coaching staff who had just played two tests against the Springboks. Wales' team selection was affected by injuries to Hal Luscombe, Sonny Parker (both thumb), Dwayne Peel (ankle) and Michael Owen (back); Luscombe's thumb was put in a splint, and both he and Parker were deemed fit to start the game, while Peel received \"intensive treatment\" on his ankle and also started. Owen was initially named in the starting XV, but withdrew the day before the game with back spasms and was replaced by Alix Popham. The only other changes to the squad from the second test against Argentina were also in the forwards; Gethin Jenkins replaced Duncan Jones at loosehead prop, Mefin Davies returned in place of Huw Bennett after an illness, and lock Deiniol Jones came in to win his third cap after Brent Cockbain left the touring party for family reasons. Meanwhile, South Africa made two changes to the team from their second test victory over Ireland; prop Faan Rautenbach recovered from injury to replace Eddie Andrews, while Brent Russell replaced the injured Jaque Fourie.\nShane Williams almost scored the opening try for Wales early in the game, but it was ruled out for offside; however, referee Steve Walsh was playing advantage after an earlier South Africa infringement, allowing Gavin Henson to kick the first three points. South Africa responded with a try from captain John Smit, converted by Percy Montgomery, who added a penalty of his own before the midway point in the half. Henson and Montgomery then exchanged penalties, but another South Africa try from Russell extended their lead after Henson had missed touch with a clearing kick. Peel also failed to clear as the first half drew to a close, and Breyton Paulse returned the ball for an eventual seven points, giving the hosts a 27–6 lead at the break. Ten minutes after the interval, Popham was knocked out in a tackle with opposite number Jacques Cronjé and had to be replaced; Wales had already brought on their specialist back row replacement, Jonathan Thomas, in the first half, so hooker Huw Bennett had to fill in as an emergency number 8. After that, South Africa added two more tries through Wayne Julies and Russell's second, though Montgomery failed to convert Julies' score. Peel scored Wales' first try soon after the hour mark, converted by Henson, but South Africa's replacement scrum-half, Bolla Conradie, restored the Springbok lead with help from another Montgomery conversion. Schalk Burger scored South Africa's seventh try to take them past the 50-point mark and a 40-point lead, though Shane Williams scored a late consolation for Wales; the conversion was missed and the match finished with a final score of 53–18, continuing Wales' winless run in South Africa.\nPeel put the defeat down to South Africa's ability to win and keep the ball, but he also praised the team's persistence even when trailing by 40 points. Captain Colin Charvis said that the game was lost in the forwards, where the Welsh front five were outplayed and the loose forwards struggled to keep up with their Springbok counterparts. After being taken to hospital, Alix Popham was diagnosed with a concussion but no broken bones; fly-half Ceri Sweeney was praised for his quick action in preventing Popham from swallowing his tongue while unconscious. Popham later flew home with the rest of the squad. After the tour, coach Mike Ruddock said the touring squad should be given a 10-week pre-season, including a month off after the final game."

After the 1982 season the team changed its name to Puumat (Pumas) and has been one of the most successful clubs and the only club to remain from the 1980s; and still plays currently.\nDue to the recession, the 1992 season was not played, and the history of baseball can be divided between pre-1992 and post 1992.\nThe only team outside the Helsinki Metropolitan Area to win the Finnish Championship was Riihimäen Piraijat (Riihimäki Piranhas) in 1994.\nLeague format.\nThe season starts in early May, and is completed by the end of August or early September. Currently there are 4 teams in the top league. Each team in the Finnish Championship Series plays 15 games; teams play against each other 5 times.

        "text": "The UT Arlington Mavericks women's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Western Athletic Conference and representing the University of Texas at Arlington. Home games are played at College Park Center, located on the university's campus in Arlington, Texas. The team appeared in the 2005 NCAA tournament, losing to #4 seed Texas Tech in the first round, 69–49, and the 2007 NCAA tournament, dropping their first round game to #4 seed Texas A&amp;M 58–50.\nThe team has also made three postseason appearances in the NIT, the first in 1998 as an at-large, the second in 2009 and the most recent was another at-large bid in 2017.\nIn 2018–19, the Mavericks finished in a tie for the Sun Belt regular season title. UTA played in the WNIT again, winning their first-round game against Stephen F. Austin, the first postseason win in program history.\nTeam history.\nThe Mavericks began their first year of play in the 1972–73 season in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Legendary coach Jody Conradt joined the Mavericks in their second year and was head coach for three years. When all women’s sports joined the NCAA and began play in the same conferences as the men’s sports, UTA began competing in the Southland Conference in 1982–83. Since that time, they have won three regular season titles and two tournament titles. They have finished as the regular season runner-up four times and been the tournament runner-up twice.\nUTA joined the Western Athletic Conference for the 2012–13 season. It was a short stint as UTA joined the Sun Belt Conference July 1, 2013. After nine athletic seasons, UTA rejoined the WAC on July 1, 2023.\nFacilities.\nUntil February 2012, the Mavericks played at Texas Hall, which is a 3,300-seat theater on the campus. The teams played on the stage, and fans could watch the game from either the theater seats or the bleacher section.\nA new arena called the College Park Center with a seating capacity of 7,000 hosted the final four regular-season home games for the team in 2012. The facility is located on the eastern side of the campus along with new housing, parking, and retail developments.\nThe Mavericks did not initially have a home court advantage at CPC as UTA sported a 24–39 record at the end of the 2015–16 season. Since then, the team has made a CPC a much harder place to visit, posting winning home records every year since then, 72–23 overall. As of the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, UTA is 96–62, a winning percentage of .608.\nCoaches.\nThe Mavericks have had 10 coaches, listed below, in their 51-year history. Shereka Wright is the current coach. Her first full season began in October, 2020. She is currently in her fifth season as the Mavericks's head coach.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Mavericks have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments, with a combined record of 0–3.\nNIT results.\nThe Mavericks have appeared in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) four times. Their combined record is 1–4."

        "title": "Matt Murray (ice hockey, born 1994)",
        "text": "Matthew Murray (born May 25, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Murray was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the third round (83rd overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. In 2016, Murray won his first Stanley Cup championship as the starting goaltender for the Penguins during the playoffs after having replaced then-starter Marc-André Fleury. Murray would split the net with Fleury during the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, winning the Stanley Cup again in 2017. Murray became the first goaltender to win back-to-back Stanley Cups as a rookie. In recent years, his career has been plagued by injuries.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nMurray was born and raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario and played his minor hockey with the Thunder Bay Minor Hockey Association. He spent his younger years playing AA before moving up to the Thunder Bay Kings AAA program.\nIn his minor midget season (2009–10), Murray led his Kings to a 3–2–0 record at the OHL Cup. That season with the Kings, Murray appeared in 40 games with a 2.28 GAA and six shutouts. He was subsequently selected in the second round (35th overall) of the 2010 OHL Priority Selection by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds.\nMurray played major junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. On September 4, 2013, Murray was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nDuring his first full professional season with the Penguins AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in 2014–15, on March 8, 2015, Murray set an AHL record for the longest shutout streak by not allowing any goals for 304 minutes and 11 seconds. The previous record of 268:17 was held by Barry Brust.\nOn March 22, Murray recorded his tenth shutout of the season, breaking a record for rookie AHL goaltenders set by Gordie Bell in 1942–43. He would finish the regular season with 12 shutouts. Murray capped his standout rookie season by sweeping the AHL awards, he was selected to the AHL First All-Star Team and Rookie Team while winning the Baz Bastien Memorial Award as the League's best goaltender and the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award as best rookie.\nIn the 2015–16 season, Murray was recalled from the AHL for the first time to the Pittsburgh Penguins on December 15, 2015, and made his NHL debut on December 19, 2015 in a 2–1 loss against the Carolina Hurricanes. Murray was recalled again by the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 21, 2016, and started nine games to finish the season.\nOn April 19, 2016, the 21-year-old Murray made his NHL playoff debut in game three of the first round becoming the youngest goaltender in franchise history to start a post-season game. He allowed just one goal as the Penguins defeated the New York Rangers 3–1. Two days later, Murray recorded his first career playoff shutout in a 5–0 win over the Rangers.\nMurray remained the starter throughout the 2016 playoffs. After being replaced by veteran Marc-André Fleury, who returned from injury in game five of the third round, he started in all remainder games of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. Murray led the Penguins past the San Jose Sharks in the finals to the franchise's fourth Stanley Cup. He posted an impressive .923 save percentage and 2.08 GAA throughout the playoffs and became only the sixth starting rookie goaltender in the Stanley Cup Finals since 1976.\nMurray was then re-signed by the Penguins to a three-year contract with an annual average salary of $3.75 million.\nTo start the 2016–17 season, Murray was injured due to a broken hand sustained during international play. Following his return, he supplanted the veteran Fleury as the Penguins starter and retained his elite form from his first year. During the season, he recorded 32 wins, a .923 save percentage, 2.41 GAA, and four shutouts. He finished within the top ten of the NHL amongst qualifying goaltenders in wins, save percentage, and shutouts, while finishing 11th in GAA. This elite play allowed Murray to finish fourth in Calder Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year and earned Murray a spot on the 2016–17 All-Rookie Team and the 2017 NHL All-Playoff Team.\nHe recorded his first NHL point on December 8, 2016, an assist on an empty net goal.\nDuring warm-ups of game one of the Penguins' first-round matchup versus the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, Murray was injured and Fleury replaced him. He saw his first action of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs in game three of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Ottawa Senators after Fleury was pulled from the game. He recorded a shutout two games later, stopping all 25 shots he faced in a 7–0 win. A thrilling game seven overtime win helped Murray and the Penguins reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the second year in a row. Despite two solid starts in the first two games against the Nashville Predators, Murray's game faltered in games three and four. As a result, there was much speculation about who would start in the fifth game. Murray was announced as the starter and stopped all 24 shots the Nashville Predators shot at him in a 6–0 win. Murray made 27 saves in game six, shutting out the Predators 2–0 and winning the Stanley Cup for the second consecutive season.\nDuring the 2017–18 NHL season Murray sustained his second concussion during practice. On February 26, 2018, during practice, Murray was struck in the head with a puck shot by teammate and defenseman Olli Maatta and was forced to leave the session early. Murray had previously sustained a concussion in the 2015–16 season causing him to miss the first two games of the playoffs. Matt Murray returned from his February 2018 concussion, as the Penguins' starting goaltender, on March 20, 2018, against the New York Islanders. Murray allowed four goals in the Penguins' 4–1 loss during that game.\nMurray recorded the longest playoff shutout streak in Penguins franchise history at 225:49. It started during game four of the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals and ended in game two of the Penguins' 2018 first-round series against the Philadelphia Flyers, when Shayne Gostisbehere scored late in the first period. On April 18, 2018, Murray became the fastest goaltender to record 25 playoff wins in the NHL. On April 23, 2018, Murray was nominated for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy as a player who best exemplifies leadership qualities and gives back to in his community. Despite Murray's efforts, Pittsburgh ended up losing to the Washington Capitals in six games in the second round of the playoffs.\nMurray was the starting goaltender for the Penguins to begin the 2018–19 season. After starting two games, Murray was diagnosed with a concussion following practice on October 8 and was ruled out indefinitely. He returned to the lineup on October 13 as a backup to Casey DeSmith only to be placed on injured reserve again in November due to a lower-body injury.\nMurray and the Penguins were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs; Murray recorded a 3.01 goals against average for the series.\nOn October 12, 2019, Murray recorded his 100th NHL win, a 7–4 victory over the Minnesota Wild; he accomplished the feat in only 166 games, tying Pete Peeters for seventh fastest since the 1967 expansion.\nOttawa Senators.\nOn October 7, 2020, as an impending restricted free agent, Murray was traded by the Penguins to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Jonathan Gruden and a second-round pick in 2020. On October 9, Murray signed a four-year, $25 million contract extension with the Senators.\nDuring his second year under contract, Murray opened the season by going winless in his opening six appearances. On November 28, 2021, Murray was placed on waivers and later demoted to regain his game with AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators, the following day after going unclaimed. After two games in Belleville, managing a 1–1–0 record and a .918 save percentage, Murray was recalled to Ottawa to resume duties as the starter. His season came to an end on March 4, 2022, after a collision with Senators defenceman Nikita Zaitsev left him with a concussion. In his absence, Anton Forsberg began to establish himself as the team's preferred starting goaltender. The Senators opted to extend Forsberg after the end of the season, fueling speculation that they would look to trade Murray elsewhere. General manager Pierre Dorion first attempted a deal with the Buffalo Sabres, having arranged to send Murray and the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft to the Sabres in exchange for the sixteenth overall pick. However, the Sabres had been included on Murray's no-trade list as part of his contract, and he declined to waive it; Ottawa ultimately moved the pick tied to Murray to Chicago in a package deal for Alex DeBrincat.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nShortly after the vetoed trade to the Sabres, rumors began to publicly appear heavily connecting Murray to interest from the rival Toronto Maple Leafs. Ultimately the Senators announced on July 11, 2022, that they had traded Murray to the Maple Leafs, along with a third-round pick in 2023 and a seventh-round pick in 2024, in exchange for future considerations. The Senators also retained 25% of Murray's salary for the remainder of the contract. Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas and coach Sheldon Keefe had both known Murray during his time in the OHL with the Greyhounds and with Leafs starting goaltender Jack Campbell expected to depart in free agency, they settled on Murray as a replacement.\nMurray played the Maple Leafs' season-opening game, a 4–3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on October 12, 2022, but on October 15 he departed the team's morning skate with groin pain. It was subsequently announced that he had suffered an adductor injury and would miss at least four weeks of the regular season. He picked up his first Maple Leafs win on November 15, 2022, a 5–2 win against his former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins and his first Maple Leafs shutout on December 6 against the Dallas Stars. His season was injury plagued, suffering three major injuries that kept him out of the lineup for significant time, including a concussion on April 2 in a game versus the Detroit Red Wings which caused him to miss the rest of the season.\nOn October 9, 2023, it was announced that Murray had undergone bilateral hip surgery, causing him to miss six to eight months.\nInternational play.\nMurray represented Team North America at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, as starting goaltender. On September 19, he broke his hand playing against Russia but went undiagnosed for several days before getting an MRI and confirmed with a broken ligament.\nOn April 29, 2019, Murray was named as the first choice goaltender to backstop Canada at the 2019 IIHF World Championship held in Slovakia. Recording five wins in seven games, Murray helped Canada progress through to the playoff rounds before losing the final to Finland to finish with the Silver Medal on May 26, 2019.\nPersonal life.\nMurray's father, who died in January 2018, was from Scotland and his mother is from the Netherlands. He married his high school sweetheart Christina Sirignano on June 20, 2019."

It ran alongside the 2013–14 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2012–13 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher placed team to be demoted instead. This last happened at the end of the 2011–12 season when 9th place Bourgoin were relegated thereby reprieving 15th place Béziers.\nFixtures.\nAfter the General Assembly of the \"League National de Rugby\", held at Aix-en-Provence on 5 and 6 July 2013, the outline calendar of fixtures for the 2013–14 season were released. Detailed fixtures information evolves as the season progresses (i.e. specific kick off times). Match attendances are from the official web site (\"Affluences\").\nPlay–offs.\nThe highest ranked team at the end of the regular season – Lyon – won automatic promotion to the Top 14 as \"champion de France de PRO D2 2014\".\nSemi–finals.\nThe semi–finals follow a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home.\nFinal.\nThe winners of the semi–finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14."

        "text": "The ECAC Hockey Tournament is the conference tournament for ECAC Hockey. The winner of the tournament received an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament which has occurred every year the NCAA has allowed automatic berths into the tournament. The ECAC tournament champion has only once not received an invitation to the NCAA tournament, that coming in 1963 when Harvard won its first conference championship (the second year in existence for the ECAC).\nThe tournament was first held in 1962, the first year of conference play. It was held at Boston Arena in Boston from 1962–66. It then moved to the much larger Boston Garden From 1967–92 (capacity for ice hockey games was 14,000+ in the Garden as opposed to the ~4,000 at the Arena). Because of a schism that occurred in the ECAC in 1984 that saw most Boston-area schools break away and form the Hockey East conference in 1984, the championship rounds moved to the Olympic Arena in Lake Placid, New York, for the next decade (1993–2002). From 2003–2010, along with a change to the tournament format, the semifinal and championship games were moved to the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, which changed its name to the 'Times Union Center' in 2007. From 2011 thru 2013 the final four games were held at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and afterwards it was announced that the 2014 championship would return to Lake Placid and play at the since renamed Herb Brooks Arena.\nHistory.\nIn 1960, two play-in games were held for the top four eastern teams that were up for two spots in the NCAA tournament. About a year and a half later, ECAC Hockey was founded and included nearly 30 programs. Despite the cumbersome arrangement, the league held its first conference tournament in 1962 and has crowned a champion every year since with the exception of 2020 (as of 2023).\nIn response to a threat from the Ivy League schools to split from the conference over scheduling disagreements, the six teams that comprised the East Division left the conference to form Hockey East in 1984. ECAC Hockey still contained eleven teams after the break and was able to retain its automatic bid to the tournament, a necessity for the stability of a conference.\nThe tournament was first hosted at the Boston Arena and was moved to the Boston Garden in 1967. The tournament remained there from 1967 through 1992 and was succeeded by the Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, New York, from 1993 to 2002 and again from 2014 to the present. The Times Union Center and the Boardwalk Hall have also hosted ECAC tournament championships.\nCornell has won the most ECAC Hockey championships with 13 and also has the most championship game appearances with 24. Current Cornell coach Mike Schafer has won the most championships with six and also has coached in the most championship games with 12 appearances.\nIn 1989 the championship trophy was renamed in honor of retiring commissioner Robert Whitelaw.\nFormats.\nThe ECAC Hockey Tournament format begins as a single-game elimination three-round format featuring the top eight teams in the standings.\nThe quarterfinal round is changed to a two-game format where if the two teams are tied afterwards a 'mini-game' is held to determine who advances. Overtime is not played in the quarterfinals outside the 'mini-games'\nTwo preliminary games are added to determine the final two qualifiers in the tournament played between the teams that finished seventh thru tenth in the standings.\nThe quarterfinal round was changed to a single-elimination format.\nThe quarterfinal round was converted into a modified best-of-three series where the first team to receive three points would advance (2 points for a win 1 point for a tie) with only the third game permitted to continue past a 5-minute overtime if the score was still tied.\nThe preliminary round was scrapped and the quarterfinal round expanded into 5 modified best-of-three series. The two lowest-seeded teams to advance out of the quarterfinals would then play in a single 'Four vs. Five' game to determine the final semifinalist.\nThe quarterfinal round was altered to include standard best-of-three series with no ties allowed.\nECAC Hockey adds a fourth round to the tournament (called the 'First Round') and includes all 12 conference teams in the tournament. The First round pits the fifth thru twelfth teams in the standings in four best-of-three series with the winners advancing to the quarterfinals. The top four teams in the standings automatically advance to the quarterfinal round and play the remaining four teams in reverse order of their finish in the standings in a second best-of-three round. The semifinal, third-place and championship games are all single-elimination.\nThe third place game is eliminated.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, only four competing institutions will compete in a single-elimination championship over the course of one championship weekend.\n2023\nAfter 20 years, the opening round of the tournament gets changed to single-elimination, replacing the best-of-three format prior; the quarterfinals remain best-of-three, however, along with the semifinals and final both being single games.\nPerformance by team.\nThe code in each cell represents the furthest the team made it in the respective tournament:"

        "text": "Philip Varone (born December 4, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who is currently playing with Düsseldorfer EG in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Varone was selected by the San Jose Sharks in the fifth round (147th overall) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nVarone played major junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) from 2006–07 to 2010–11, collecting 78 goals and 152 assists for 230 points in 228 games.\nProfessional.\nVarone attended the San Jose Sharks training camp in 2010, but was sent down to London for the season. By July 2011, the Sharks had not signed Varone to a contract, making him a free agent. Varone attended the Buffalo Sabres training camp in 2011, but did not make the team. He instead signed a one-year AHL contract with the Sabres' affiliate Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL). He led Rochester in scoring with 11 goals and 41 assists.\nOn March 19, 2012, the Buffalo Sabres signed Varone to a three-year entry level contract. Varone was recalled to the Sabres' active roster on January 22, 2014, and scored his first career point with an assist on a goal by Brian Flynn the next night against the Carolina Hurricanes. Varone scored his first goal in his fourth career game, against Braden Holtby of the Washington Capitals on January 28, 2014. During the 2013-2014 season, Varone also played for the Rochester Americans in the 2013 Spengler Cup, scoring 1 goal and 3 assists. \nFollowing the 2014–15 season, Varone became a restricted free agent under the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Buffalo Sabres made him a qualifying offer to retain his NHL rights and, on July 5, 2015, Varone filed for salary arbitration. The two sides reached an agreement on a one-year, two-way contract on July 13.\nIn the 2015–16 season, Varone played in a further five games with the Sabres, but was on assignment with the Rochester Americans when on February 27, 2016, he was traded to the Ottawa Senators as part of a seven-player deal. Varone was called up to Ottawa for the final game of the season, April 9, 2016 and recorded an assist. In the following 2016–17 season, Varone split between Ottawa and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. Serving as an alternate captain he appeared in 65 regular season games for Binghamton, where he recorded 36 assists and 51 points. He was scoreless over 7 games in the NHL with Ottawa.\nOn July 1, 2017, having left the Senators as a free agent, Varone signed a two-year, two-way contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. At the end of the 2017–18 regular season, Varone was named the AHL's Most Valuable Player.\nOn December 7, 2018, Varone was recalled by the Flyers. He made his Flyers debut on December 8 against the Buffalo Sabres. He scored his first goal as a member of the Flyers on December 22 in a 4–3 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nAs a free agent Varone left the Flyers to sign a one-year, two-way contract with the Montreal Canadiens on July 3, 2019. Assigned to AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket, to begin the 2019–20 season, Varone although limited through injury contributed with 14 points in 27 games. On February 20, 2020, Varone was traded by the Canadiens along with Riley Barber to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Joseph Blandisi and Jake Lucchini. He was immediately assigned to join affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Varone registered 5 assists in just 6 games before the remainder of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the following North American season delayed due to the pandemic, Varone as a free agent opted to sign abroad for the first time in his career, joining Kazahstani based club, Barys Nur-Sultan of the KHL on October 26, 2020.\nOn July 7, 2021, Varone joined Lausanne HC of the National League (NL) on a one-year deal. On November 17, 2021, Varone was shipped to SC Bern for the remainder of his contract.\nAs a free agent from Bern, Varone returned to the KHL in agreeing to a one-year deal with HC Spartak Moscow on July 21, 2022. In the 2022–23 season, Varone eclipsed his previous league high offensive totals in contributing with 15 goals and 30 points through 57 regular season games."

        "text": "Timothy Devon Anderson Jr. (born June 23, 1993) is an American professional baseball shortstop for the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Chicago White Sox.\nAnderson played college baseball at East Central Community College, and was selected in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft by the White Sox. He made his MLB debut in 2016. Anderson led the American League in batting average in 2019, won the Silver Slugger Award in 2020, and was an All-Star in 2021 and 2022.\nEarly life.\nAnderson was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. His father, Tim Sr., was arrested on drug trafficking charges before he was born and served the first 15 years of Tim Jr.'s life in prison. His birth mother was already raising four children and was unable to care for Anderson as well, so he was raised by his aunt and uncle along with their three children. His grandfather took him to visit his father often, so that they could have a relationship.\nAnderson attended Hillcrest High School in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Anderson played little league baseball as a kid but eventually cut the sport out of his life up until his junior year of high school. He focused on basketball in his first two years of high school, but broke both of his legs during his sophomore year. In his junior year, he played both baseball and basketball. As a junior, Anderson batted .333 as a left fielder. In his senior year, Anderson played as an infielder and batted .420. He was a part of the state basketball championship winning team in his senior year. Standing at , Anderson decided that he was likely too short to play professional basketball.\nCollege career.\nAnderson enrolled at East Central Community College in Decatur, Mississippi, to play college baseball. East Central was the only school to offer Anderson a baseball scholarship. In his freshman season, Anderson batted .360 with four home runs, 37 runs batted in (RBIs), and 30 stolen bases without being caught stealing. However, he received no interest from Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, and was not selected in the 2012 MLB draft. Returning to East Central for his sophomore year, Anderson had a breakout season, leading all junior college baseball players with a .495 batting average. He was named a first-team National Junior College Athletic Association Division II All-American. He committed to transfer to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Chicago White Sox selected Anderson in the first round, with the 17th overall selection, in the 2013 MLB draft. Anderson opted to sign with the White Sox, rather than enroll at UAB, for a signing bonus of $2,164,000. Though expected to make his professional debut with the Bristol White Sox of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, the White Sox assigned Anderson to the Kannapolis Intimidators of the Single–A South Atlantic League instead, a higher level than rookie ball. He batted .277 with one home run, 21 RBIs, and 24 stolen bases in 68 games for Kannapolis.\nIn 2014, Anderson began the season with the Winston-Salem Dash of the High–A Carolina League. He broke his wrist in late June, requiring surgery. In 68 games, Anderson had a .297 batting average, six home runs, and 10 stolen bases. He also committed 31 errors. When he returned in August, the White Sox promoted him to the Birmingham Barons of the Double–A Southern League, where he batted .364 in 10 games. The White Sox assigned Anderson to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League after the regular season.\nThe White Sox invited Anderson to spring training in 2015. He spent the season with Birmingham, batting .312 with five home runs and 49 stolen bases, while also committing 25 errors. Invited to spring training again in 2016, the White Sox assigned him to the Charlotte Knights of the Triple–A International League at the beginning of the season.

Anderson made his MLB debut that day, hitting a double off of Ian Kennedy of the Kansas City Royals in his first at bat. In the 2016 season, Anderson batted .283 with nine home runs in 99 games for the White Sox.\nBefore the 2017 season, Anderson signed a six-year contract worth $25 million, with club options for both the 2023 and 2024 seasons. He struggled in April 2017, batting .204 and striking out 24 times in 22 games. For the 2017 season, Anderson batted .257/.276/.402, walked in 2.1% of his at bats (the lowest percentage in the major leagues), and had the lowest walks-per-strikeout ratio in the majors (0.08). On defense, he led the major leagues in errors, with 28, and in fielding errors (with 16) and throwing errors (with 12).\nIn 2018, Anderson had a .240 batting average with 20 home runs and 26 stolen bases. On defense, he tied for the major league lead in throwing errors, with 12. In 2019, Anderson batted .335 (leading the major leagues)/.357/.508. He had the lowest walk percentage in the American League (2.9%). He had career highs in hits with 167, despite having 88 fewer plate appearances than in 2018. He also had a career high in doubles with 32, and runs with 81. On defense, he led all major league players in errors committed, with 26, and had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league shortstops (.951).\nOn April 17, 2019, Anderson was ejected after a bench-clearing incident in a game against the Kansas City Royals. After Anderson's fourth inning bat flip following a home run, he was hit by a pitch from Royals pitcher Brad Keller in his next at bat, causing both benches to clear. Two days later, Anderson was suspended one game by Major League Baseball for the use of a racial slur; ESPN's Jeff Passan reported that Anderson called Keller a \"weak-ass f—ing n-word.\" Keller received a five game suspension.\n2020–22.\nOverall with the 2020 Chicago White Sox, Anderson batted .322/.357/.529 with 45 runs (tied for the AL lead), ten home runs, and 21 RBIs in 49 games. He won a Silver Slugger Award that season.\nAnderson was the cover athlete for the 2021 installment of the \"R.B.I. Baseball\" video game series. On July 10, 2021, Anderson was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game as a replacement for Carlos Correa, who had decided not to attend. At the MLB Field of Dreams Game on August 12, 2021, Anderson hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning off of Zack Britton to win the game for the White Sox over the New York Yankees, 9–8. Overall in 2021, Anderson batted .309/.338/.469 in 123 games, with 17 home runs and 61 RBIs. He had the lowest walk percentage in the major leagues, at 4.0%.\nDuring the White Sox game against the Cleveland Guardians on April 20, 2022, Anderson made three errors in the first two innings, then gave the finger to a fan who made a comment to him. Anderson apologized after the game. MLB suspended him for one game, but Anderson successfully appealed the suspension, which was replaced by a fine.\nIn a 2019 interview, Anderson said that he kind of felt like \"today's Jackie Robinson\" in reference to him wanting to change baseball. During a game on May 21, 2022, against the New York Yankees, Yankees third baseman Josh Donaldson mockingly called Anderson \"Jackie\". Later in the game, White Sox catcher Yasmani Grandal confronted Donaldson, leading to both teams clearing their benches. After the game, manager Tony La Russa later called Donaldson's comment \"racist\" and Anderson agreed with him. Donaldson was suspended one game for \"inappropriate comments\" and apologized to both Anderson and Robinson's widow.\nDespite all the events, Anderson made the All-Star team for the second year in a row. Anderson was named the starter at shortstop for the American League, becoming the first White Sox shortstop to start in the All-Star game since Luis Aparicio in 1970. In the game, Anderson went 1-for-2, with a single in the 4th.\nOn July 30, 2022, Anderson was thrown out of the game by umpire Nick Mahrley after arguing balls and strikes. Anderson became irate and seemingly bumped the umpire's cap with his own helmet. MLB suspended Anderson for three games and fined him an undisclosed amount for making illegal contact with an umpire. The suspension was reduced from three games to two on appeal. On August 9, Anderson was placed on the IL with a torn hand ligament, ending his season. Overall in 2022, Anderson appeared in just 79 games, albetit with a .301 batting average, as well as six home runs and 25 RBIs.\n2023.\nIn 2023, Anderson represented Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. In Team USA's third game of pool play against Canada, Anderson played at second base, the first time he had played the position in his professional career.\nIn the 2023 season, Anderson struggled in the first half of the season as he batted .223 by the all-star break. Anderson also went homerless until on July 29 against the Cleveland Guardians when he hit his first home run of the season and his first homer in 379 days off of Logan Allen.\nOn August 5, Anderson instigated a bench-clearing brawl with José Ramírez of the Cleveland Guardians after Anderson applied a tag to Ramírez during a game. They exchanged punches, with Ramirez knocking Anderson down to the ground. After the game, Ramírez said that Anderson had been \"disrespecting the game for a while now\". Anderson was ejected from the game and suspended for six games. On September 3, Anderson notched his 1,000th career hit with a lead off double off of Detroit Tigers starter Tarik Skubal.\nIn 2023, Anderson had the lowest isolated power in the AL (.051) and hit the highest percentage of ground balls in the league (61.1%), while batting .245/.286/.296(the lowest slugging percentage in the AL), with an OPS of .582 (the lowest in the AL).\nOn November 4, 2023, the White Sox declined their option on Anderson, making him a free agent.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn February 24, 2024, Anderson signed a one-year, $5 million contract with the Miami Marlins.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson and his wife, Bria (née Evans), have two daughters, the first born in 2016 and the second in 2019. The family resides in Chicago year-round.\nIn 2017, Anderson's best friend was shot and killed in Tuscaloosa; they were godfathers to each other's daughters. This inspired Anderson to create a charitable foundation, called Anderson's League of Leaders, with the goal of supporting children in school and at home. The foundation financially supports interventions in various causes, including bullying and gun violence. Anderson has been known for doing charity work around the south and west sides of Chicago, which he calls his \"adopted hometown\". In 2019, Anderson brought 75 kids from the south side of Chicago to the theater to watch the film \"42\" (2013), a biopic about baseball player Jackie Robinson."

        "text": "The swimming events of the 15th FINA World Aquatics Championships were held July 28 – August 4, 2013, in Barcelona, Spain. The competition was held in a long course pool inside the Palau Sant Jordi. It featured 40 LCM events, split evenly between males and females. Swimming was one of the five aquatic disciplines at the championships.\nThe United States won the overall medal count, led by Missy Franklin who claimed a record-setting six gold medals. China's Sun Yang won three gold medals en route to \"male swimmer of the meet\". Katie Ledecky, from the United States, was named \"female swimmer of the meet\" after setting two world records and winning four gold medals. Four other women's world records were broken during the competition, all four in the women's breaststroke events.\nQualifying criteria.\nIf a nation entered one competitor in an event then they only have to meet the B standard, but if they enter two competitors then in an event then they both have to meet the A standard. Each member nation can enter one relay team in each event. Qualifying standards must have been met between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2013.\nCompetition format:\nRecap.\nDuring the World Aquatic Championships, five world records were set (one twice), all by women. Katie Ledecky of the United States broke the world record in the 800-metre freestyle and the 1500-metre freestyle events en route to two gold medals. She also won the 400-metre freestyle to go 3-for-3 in her events. She added a fourth gold, swimming a leg of the 4x200-metre freestyle relay that the United States won. Her performance earned her \"female swimmer of the meet,\" beating out fellow American Missy Franklin based on a formula that does not consider relay events. Franklin became the first woman ever to win six golds in a single World Championships. Kristin Otto of East Germany has achieved this at the 1988 Olympic Games. She won the 100-metre and 200-metre backstroke events and the 200-metre freestyle. She finished fourth in the 100-metre freestyle in personal best-time. She was also a part of all three women's relay events, which the United States swept. The previous record of five golds in a single World Championships was held by America's Tracy Caulkins and Australia's Libby Trickett. Among men, Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz of America, Ian Thorpe of Australia all won at least six golds in a single World Championships or Olympics. Franklin also moved into a tie with Trickett for most all-time gold medals with nine.\nRūta Meilutytė of Lithuania broke both the 50-metre and 100-metre breaststroke records in the semi-final of each event. Denmark's Rikke Møller Pedersen set the 200-metre breatstroke record in that event's semi-finals. However, it was Russia's Yuliya Yefimova who won the gold medal in both the 50-metre and 200-metre events, while Meilutytė took gold in the 100-metre.\nOn the men's side, Sun Yang claimed three golds by winning the 400-metre, 800-metre, and 1500-metre freestyle events to earn \"male swimmer of the meet.\" He also swam China to bronze in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay despite starting his anchor leg two seconds behind third place. Ryan Lochte from the United States won two gold to bring his overall World Champions haul to 15. In the 4x100-metre medley relay, the United States appeared to finish first by a wide margin but was disqualified because a swimmer left the platform too early. As a result, France moved up to first. Camille Lacourt won France's first ever 50-metre backstroke title. César Cielo became the first three-time World Champion of the 50-metre free, winning a final that featured three Olympic gold medalists.\nMedal summary.\nThe United States won the overall medal count with 29 medals (24% of total available) and 13 golds (32%). China won the second most golds (5), but just 9 medals overall (down from 14 in the last World Championships). Australia won 13 medals (3 gold) for second place on the total medal count. Russia won 8 medals, the most for the nation since 1998. Germany, Great Britain, and Italy, all historically strong swimming nations, won just four medals among them.\nMedal table.\n Host nation\nRecords.\nThe following world and championship records were broken during the competition.\nChampionship records.\nLegend: † – en route to final mark"

The Oilers joined the Division I ranks in 1999 as a founding member of the College Hockey America (CHA) conference, along with six other schools, after only three years in existence as a Division II program. Findlay spent five years in the CHA, never finishing higher than fourth in the standings, and only winning a single game in the conference tournament.\nAfter a change to the administration of Findlay in the summer of 2003, the University announced on January 6, 2004 that the ice hockey program would revert to club and intramural status. The change did not come as a shock to many familiar with Findlay's situation as head coach Craig Barnett had already resigned to take a position with Lake Forest Academy prep school. The MAAC refused to allow any of its teams to play the Oilers for the 2000-01 season because of conference by-laws prohibiting member teams from playing provisional Division I schools. When the CHA applied for its automatic tournament bid in 2002, the NCAA had reservations about Findlay's full Division I status as it had moved the University's athletic program to Division II status only four years earlier. Because NCAA rules mandate that automatic bid conferences must contain at least six member schools the CHA scrambled to resolve the waiver that would allow Findlay to play in the conference despite the 9-year moratorium mandated by the NCAA on teams playing above their level. The CHA was able to receive the bid for the 2003 season after a waiver was granted retroactively."

The winners of the 2012 Olympic basketball tournament, the United States, qualified outright. The USA joined the host nation Spain, which was earlier elected to host the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in July 2009.\nQualification would be via each of FIBA's zones, with each zone allocated at least two berths, with additional berths given according to the strengths of the teams within each zone. In this setup, FIBA Europe got six berths, FIBA Americas had 4, FIBA Africa and FIBA Asia, 3 teams each, and FIBA Oceania, 2 berths.\nThe continental championships in each FIBA zone doubled as a qualifying tournament. The top teams in each tournament qualified to the Basketball World Cup.\nIn addition, after the continental championships were done, four more wild cards berths were awarded by FIBA to complete the 24-team tournament.\nThis was the final set of qualification tournaments under this method. FIBA announced that the next edition of the World Cup would be held in 2019, the number of participating teams raised from 24 to 32, FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania combined into one region for purposes of qualifying for the World Cup, and that qualifying will be done in a home and away format.\nMethod.\nEach FIBA zone has a default number of berths, generally following the strengths of the national teams there. These berths, plus four wild cards and the host total in 24. However, a berth is subtracted from the FIBA zone of the Olympic champion; in this case, the United States' gold medal in 2012 reduced FIBA Americas' number of berths from five to four, with the United States qualifying as a result of their 2012 Olympic gold medal.\nA total of 117 national teams participated in qualifying. This number included teams that participated but were later suspended (Lebanon and Panama), and excluded hosts Spain, which still participated in qualifying matches, and the United States, which qualified automatically and no longer participated in qualifying matches.\nWhile the different FIBA zones employed any method in qualifying, all conducted their continental championships as qualifying tournaments. Therefore, these continental championships, along with the qualifying for these championships, serve as qualifying matches. In total, 606 qualifying matches were played to determine the qualified teams; excluding the Olympics, 568 matches were played.\nList.\nThese were listed by order of qualification.\n2012 Summer Olympics.\nThe United States defeated Spain in a rematch of the 2008 gold medal game. The United States qualified automatically to the World Cup, taking one of FIBA Americas' five berths.\nFIBA Africa.\nThe 2013 FIBA Africa Championship in the Ivory Coast served as the qualifying tournament. With three outright berths, the top three teams qualified. This meant the finalists and the winner of the third-place playoff progressed.\nFIBA Africa Championship.\nEgypt, which qualified after making their last appearance in 1994, and perennial qualifiers Angola got the first two berths for FIBA Africa after advancing to the final of the 2013 FIBA Africa Championship. Senegal defeated host team Ivory Coast on the third-place playoff via a last-second four-point play to take Africa's last outright berth.\nFIBA Americas.\nThe 2013 FIBA Americas Championship in Venezuela served as the qualifying tournament. With four outright berths, the top four teams qualified. This meant the semifinalists progressed.\nFIBA Americas Championship.\nOn 7 September 2013, Puerto Rico secured their classification to the World Cup after defeating hosts Venezuela 86–85 after extra time in the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship. The next day, the Dominican Republic eliminated Uruguay to qualify; this is the first appearance of the Dominicans in the World Cup since 1978. In the next game, Argentina's victory over Canada ensured that they and Mexico, the 2013 FIBA Americas Champions, qualify, thereby eliminating the Canadians and host Venezuela; the Mexicans returned to the World Cup after their last appearance in 1974. Brazil was chosen as a wild card for the World Cup after having previously lost all three games against Canada, Puerto Rico and Jamaica.\nFIBA Asia.\nThe 2013 FIBA Asia Championship in the Philippines served as the qualifying tournament. With three outright berths, the top three teams qualified. This meant the finalists and the winner of the third-place playoff progressed.\nFIBA Asia Championship.\nIran and the Philippines became the first teams to qualify via the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship in Manila by advancing to the final. Iran made their second consecutive appearance while the Philippines qualified for the World Cup after 35 years of missing the tournament, their last appearance being in 1978 when they hosted the event. Korea, whose last appearance was in 1998, took the third and last automatic Asian berth after winning third place in the said tournament.\nFIBA Europe.\nThe EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia served as the qualifying tournament. With six outright berths, the top six teams qualified. This meant the semifinalists and the participants in the fifth-place playoff progressed. Spain, which has qualified already, participated, finishing within the top six. With this, the seventh-placed team took its place.\nFIBA EuroBasket.\nOn 18 September 2013, France secured their third consecutive qualification to the World Cup after beating hosts Slovenia in the EuroBasket 2013 quarterfinals. On the next day, Slovenia qualified after beating Serbia in the 5th–8th Semifinals, while Croatia defeated Ukraine, and Lithuania defeated Italy to both grab tickets to the final tournament. On 20 September 2013, Ukraine qualified for the first time ever after defeating Italy. On the next day, Serbia bounced back from two consecutive losses to win against Italy that led them to the FIBA World Cup after snatching the last outright remaining berth at the EuroBasket 2013. Finland, Greece and Turkey were selected as wild cards for the World Cup berth on 1 February, with Finland, along with newcomers Ukraine, marking their FIBA World Cup debut.\nFIBA Oceania.\nThe 2013 FIBA Oceania Championship was a two-legged tie between Australia and New Zealand. Since FIBA Oceania had two outright berths, this meant both teams were already qualified in the 2014 Basketball World Cup provided a team didn't forfeit a match.\nWild card.\nFIBA selected four wild cards after all of the continental championships were done. FIBA was prohibited from selecting more than three teams from the same continental zone and from selecting teams that did not participate in qualifying either through choice or FIBA-mandated suspension.\nOn 31 October, FIBA announced that fifteen teams submitted wild card applications. These were:\nOf those fifteen, Italy and Germany withdrew before the meeting in Barcelona on 3 February, citing financial reasons. Germany indicated that it was willing to pay up to 300,000 euros for a place but that the sum required by FIBA to receive a place at the World Cup was more in the range of 1 million euros. Gianni Petrucci, chairman of the Italian federation stated that to make an offer in excess of 800,000 euros for a spot would be unethical. On 30 January, a report from Spanish sports newspaper \"El Mundo Deportivo\" said that China and Russia also withdrew from wild card contention. There had been no official confirmation from either FIBA or the Chinese or Russian federations on the reported withdrawal. A day later, it was confirmed that the Chinese indeed withdrew from the wild card race, as they could not form a viable team.\nOn 1 February, FIBA announced that its Central Board awarded the wild cards to , , and ."

        "text": "Michael Houser (born September 13, 1992) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently playing with the Rochester Americans in the American Hockey League (AHL). He has previously played with the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nFollowing a lone season with the Des Moines Buccaneers of the United States Hockey League (USHL), Houser joined the Ontario Hockey League's (OHL) London Knights for the 2009–10 season. Going (17–4–1) in 25 appearances, he was named to the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) All-Rookie Team and the OHL First All-Rookie Team. The 2011–12 season saw Houser go (46–15–5) in 62 games. He was rewarded with the Jim Rutherford Trophy for OHL goaltender of the year as well as the Red Tilson Trophy for the league's most outstanding player. Houser was also recognized as the CHL Goaltender of the Year. The Knights won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as league champions but were defeated by the host Shawinigan Cataractes in the final of the Memorial Cup.\nUndrafted, Houser attended the Florida Panthers' 2012 development camp. On July 11, the Panthers signed him to a three-year, entry-level contract. He spent his first professional season playing for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Houser moved to the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 2013–14 season, going 12–13–1.\nThe Panthers chose not to tender Houser with a qualifying offer following the 2014–15 season, rendering him an unrestricted free agent. He skated with both the AHL's Ontario Reign and the ECHL's Manchester Monarchs for the 2015–16 season.\nHouser attended the Columbus Blue Jackets' 2016 training camp but was not signed. He instead signed with the team's AHL affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters on October 14. Aside from a lone appearance with the Monsters, Houser spent the majority of the season with the Cyclones.\nHouser once again attended an NHL training camp the following season, this time for the Arizona Coyotes. He was released on September 18, but spent the season with their affiliates (the AHL's Tucson Roadrunners and ECHL's Fort Wayne Komets).\nAs the Cyclones goaltender for the 2018–19 season, Houser had a 29–7–5 record in 41 games. He was named ECHL Goaltender of the Year as well as a member of the league's first all-star team.\nOn September 11, 2020, the Rochester Americans re-signed Houser to a one-year contract. He remained on the Americans' roster as the Cyclones—an affiliate of the Americans—opted out of the 2020–21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 19, 2021, the Buffalo Sabres signed Houser to a one-year contract for the remainder of the season. He subsequently spent time on the team's taxi squad. Houser made his NHL debut on May 3, stopping 34 shots in a 4–2 win over the New York Islanders. Speaking about making the NHL and winning his first game, he stated \"I've worked my whole life for this, for it to happen. Just to play a game is really special. But to win, winning is always the goal. That's why we play.\" Houser started a second-straight game against the Islanders the following night, this time making 45 saves in a 4–3 shootout win.\nAs a free agent following his stint with the Sabres, Houser continued within the organization in agreeing to a one-year contract to remain with the Rochester Americans on August 5, 2021. With the Sabres suffering a spate of goaltender injuries for the second consecutive season, Houser was signed to a one-year, two-way contract in returning to the NHL with Buffalo on January 12, 2022.\nOn July 15, 2022, Houser was familiarly re-signed to remain within the Sabres organization, agreeing to a one-year AHL contract to continue with the Rochester Americans.\nHouser returned for his fifth season in the Americans organization, signing as a free agent from the Sabres on a one-year AHL contract on July 7, 2023.

        "title": "Golf Wang",
        "text": "Golf Wang (stylised in all caps as GOLF WANG) is an American street-wear brand established in 2011 by American musician Tyler, the Creator. The name Golf Wang is a spoonerism of his Los Angeles-based musical collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA) or Odd Future for short, of which he was a co-founder. Golf Wang is known for its colorful visual aesthetic. In 2013, the brand expanded beyond its Odd Future affiliation and established itself in the fashion industry. It is designed by Tyler, the Creator. The brand offers clothing, footwear through collaborations with converse often under the name GOLF le FLEUR*, jewellery, upon other products. \"Holiday 1991\", the brand's first look book, was released on December 11, 2011.\nCreative expansion.\nSplit from Odd Future.\nGolf Wang still affiliated with Odd Future, during its December 2011 debut. In 2013, Golf Wang publicly separated from Odd Future.\nCollaborations.\nIn its history, Golf Wang has gone on to collaborate with other brands as a part of various projects. Golf Wang's first notable collaboration was its project with Vans. The partnership lasted from 2013 to 2016. In an interview with Dazed Magazine in 2017, Tyler stated that Golf Wang cut ties with Vans due to a lack of creative liberty. Following Golf Wang's departure from Vans, Tyler, the Creator and Converse collaborated to create the shoe collection GOLF le FLEUR*. In 2017, Golf Wang collaborated with Japanese sandal brand SUICOKE. Their first release was the KAW-CAB sandals in colors 'Mocha' and 'Lemon Yellow'. In April 2019, they released a third version of the KAW-CAB sandals. Then in October 2019, a different silhouette called the 'DEPA-CAB' sandals was released in two new colorways. Also in 2019, GOLF le FLEUR* and Converse released a new, original silhouette named the 'GLF Giano Ox'. The shoes were available in two colorways, 'Bright Concord' and 'Cuban Sand'. That same year, GOLF WANG created a scented candle in collaboration with Japanese fragrance label \"reta W\". Named 'Coldwater', the candle was released on March 23, 2019. For apparel, Golf le Fleur partnered with fashion brand Lacoste for an SS19 collection named 'GOLF le COSTE*'. The clothing line featured colors such as pale pink, beige, and off-white named respectively 'litchi', 'geode', and 'mascarpone'. Golf le Fleur then collaborated with Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams. The first ice cream was named 'Snowflake', released on July 8, 2019, it was a white chocolate ice cream flavor. The second flavor, 'Pluto Bleu' was released online on September 17, 2020, and was a blood orange and blueberry flavored ice cream. On May 20, 2020, Golf Wang released a top and bottom set with Levi Strauss &amp; Co. for their '501 day'. The collaboration featured Levi's vintage-fit trucker jacket and 501 '93 jeans in Ecru denim with rainbow-colored polka dots.\nGOLF le FLEUR*.\nGolf le Fleur was introduced at the Golf Wang fashion show at Made L.A. on June 11, 2016. Named \"Golf le Fleur\" (stylized as \"GOLF le FLEUR*\"), it was first introduced as a shoe collaboration between Tyler, the Creator and Converse. The collection was named \"GOLF le FLEUR*\" to mean Flower Boy in French though the translation is inaccurate. It was released in the same year as Tyler's Flower Boy album. First made available to the public on July 13, 2017, the first design released was Converse One Star shoes in a new, light blue colorway called \"Clearwater\".\nAs of December 2021, Golf le FLEUR* has branched away from Golf Wang into a standalone luxury lifestyle and apparel brand debuting with an invite-only pop-up shop in Los Angeles.\nOn August 3, 2017, the first set of Golf le Fleurs was released. They came in 4 colors, called \"Airway Blue\" (light blue), \"Peach Pearl\" (peach colored), \"Sulfur\" (yellow) and \"Fuchsia Glow\" (fuchsia/lavender).\nOn October 16, 2017, the second set of Golf le Fleurs was announced. This set was named the \"Uno\", which contained three new shoes with a brand-new insole, design, and bottom. The colors Jolly Green (forest green), Vanilla (cream), and Solar Power (yellow), were released on November 2, 2017.\nOn January 4, 2018, the second set of \"Anas\", and the third overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They were released on January 18, 2018, with the colors \"Bachelor Blue\" (light blue), \"Geranium Pink\" (light pink), and \"Jade Lime\" (light green).\nOn April 23, 2018, the first set of the line known as \"Momos\", and the fourth overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They are a monotone colored shoe, and on April 26, 2018, they were released. The colors were \"Black\", \"White\", \"Greener Pastures\" (dark green), \"Limoges\" (dark blue), and \"Rhubarb\" (burgundy).\nOn May 23, the third set of \"Anas\", (also nicknamed \"two-toned\") and the fifth overall set of Golf le Fleurs were announced. They were released on June 1, 2018, with the colors \"Purple Heart\" (purple and green), \"Molten Lava\" (red and blue), \"Candy Pink\" (red and pink), and \"Plume\" (baby blue and baby pink).\nOn February 23, 2019, the \"Industrial\" line was released with another rework of the Converse (shoe company) \"One Star\". The shoes were released with barely blue/egret/black and barely blue/patriot/egret colorways. The line also included matching '60s workwear boilersuits.\nOn May 17, the \"Velvet le Fleur\" line was released. This included two reworks of the \"One Star\" in red and brown as well as a rework of the \"Chuck 70\" in purple, all of which use a quilted velvet material.\nOn June 28, another pair of \"Anas\" was released, featuring a bright rainbow sole and an all-white upper.\nOn September 13, a pair of Converse All-Stars was released with a polka dot design.\nFashion shows.\nGolf Wang made its runway debut on June 11, 2016, at Made LA, a fashion event created by IMG. 2016 was the premiere of Made LA on the west coast. The show also marked the debut of the 'Golf le Fleur' shoe collaboration, with Converse and Vans. In addition to a live audience, the show was broadcast on the internet. Notable attendees included Kanye West, Dylan and Cole Sprouse, Kendall Jenner, YG, Janelle Monáe, Solange Knowles, and Amandla Stenberg.\nThe show implemented a \"see-now, buy-now\" process at the event, meaning that the collection was available for pre-order after the show. The show's set design included a bedroom connected to a skate ramp and the event was accompanied by musical performances.\nGolf Wang's 3 Flagship stores.\nThe first Odd Future store was opened on Fairfax Avenue in 2011. The Odd Future would come to be the first retail space that sold Golf Wang. In 2014, Tyler described in a series of tweets that the Odd Future store on Fairfax Avenue had closed. On October 25, 2017, Tyler announced that he would open the Golf Wang flagship, named \"GOLF\" on 350 North Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, California. The new location officially opened on October 26, 2017, and features an indoor skating bowl. A second \"GOLF\" storefront opened on November 12, 2022, located on 35 Howard Street in New York, NYC. Finally, third \"GOLF\" storefront opened in London on October 21, 2023, becoming the first store to open outside of the United States launching their \"GOLF ACROSS THE POND\" limited time campaign. Tyler held meet and greets at both stores upon their opening.\nCollections.\nGOLF WANG has released a variety of collections since 2013. The most notable being: F/W 2013, S/S 2014, F/W 2014, S/S 2015, F/W 2015, F/W 2016, F/W 2017, AUTUMN 2018, WINTER 2018, SUMMER 2019, WINTER 2019, AUTUMN 2019, AUTUMN 2020, WINTER 2020, AUTUMN 2020, WINTER 2020, SUMMER 2021, WINTER 2021, SUMMER 2022, F/W 2022, S/S 2023 and F/W 2023."

        "title": "2013–14 Houston Cougars men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2013–14 Houston Cougars men's basketball team represented the University of Houston during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The season marked the first for the Cougars as members of the American Athletic Conference. The team, coached by James Dickey in his fourth year, played their home games at Hofheinz Pavilion. They finished the season 17–16, 8–10 in conference play to finish in sixth place. They advanced to the semifinals of the American Conference tournament where they lost to Louisville.\nAfter the season, Dickey stepped down for personal reasons. He was 64–62 in four seasons, and was replaced by Kelvin Sampson.\nPre-season.\nThe Cougars' off-season had been defined primarily by the number of departures from the program. On May 14, the school announced that it had granted permission to sophomore point guard J. J. Thompson to transfer to another school. No reason was given. Ten days later, the school announced that four-star 2012 class recruit Valentine Izundu was also granted release from the program. Like Thompson, no reason why given for Izundu's departure, but it was noted that he had seen very limited playing time in his previous season as a freshman. However, one month after announcing his leave, Izundu decided to return. In his statement, he apologized to Coach Dickey and teammates and mentioned that he made a mistake in leaving the team. On June 1, the program announced that Michael Young, former Cougar player and Phi Slama Jama member during the 1980–84 seasons, would not be retained as Director of Basketball Operations. Young was offered a reassignment in the program, but refused it and decided to leave the school. As a result, his son Joe Young, the Cougars' leading scorer during the 2012–13 season also decided to leave the program and transfer to Oregon.\nDespite the departures, the Cougars were still able to build by signing Ohio Player of the Year and three-star recruit Jaaron Simmons. The point guard out of Archbishop Alter High School signed a national letter of intent on April 18, choosing the Cougars over Butler and Dayton, among others. Simmons mentioned that the opportunity to play with standout players Danuel House, Joe Young, and TaShawn Thomas helped in his decision to sign with Houston. In June, former Baylor guard L. J. Rose announced his transfer to Houston to be closer to his mother who had been diagnosed with lupus. Rose was ranked 63rd in the ESPN100 Class of 2012 and 9th at guard. The Cougars applied for a waiver to the NCAA to allow Rose to play for the team immediately, and the waiver was granted on August 20. The third offseason addition to the Cougars was 6'9\" Egyptian-born post player Ahmed Hamdy, who had international experience at the 2010 FIBA Under-17 World Championship with the Egyptian national team.\nSchedule and results.\nOn May 21, the Cougars participation as one of the four hosts in the 2013 Legends Classic alongside Pittsburgh, Stanford, and Texas Tech was announced. Houston hosted a pair of regional round games between November 17–21, and then traveled to Brooklyn to participate in the championship round with the other four hosts on November 25–26 at the Barclays Center.\nThe Cougars' 2013-14 schedule was announced on August 21, featuring 17 home games. The schedule's highlights included round-robin play against the other nine American Athletic Conference members, the four previously-announced Legends Classic games, a road game against former Southwest Conference rival Texas A&amp;M, and a neutral site matchup against crosstown rival Rice at the Toyota Center. All of Houston's 18 conference games and the two final games of the Legends Classic tournament were televised on the ESPN family of networks or CBS Sports Network.\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#c00; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#c00; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#c00; color:white;\"| American Athletic Conference regular season\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#c00; color:white;\"| American Athletic Conference tournament"

It is a versatile position, as the wingback may be called upon to block, take a handoff, or run downfield for a pass. An example of a formation that uses a wingback is the single-wing.\nThere are few contemporary college football or professional football teams that use the wingback position. Historically, Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska played as a wingback when he won the Heisman Trophy in 1972."

He was born in the United States, but after spending the majority of his professional career in Austria he acquired dual citizenship. He now lives in Vienna and coaches basketball.\nPlaying career.\nPayton did not begin playing basketball until his junior year at Camden High School in Camden, New Jersey. He had been a football player until then, but a football injury the previous year ended his pursuit of that sport. Then-head basketball coach Clarence Turner spotted Payton in the marching band, and upon seeing his size, recruited him to play forward for the team. In his senior season, Camden won the New Jersey Group IV state championship.\nPayton's athleticism allowed him to progress quickly, and just three years after first playing organized basketball he found himself suiting up as a freshman for Appalachian State University, an NCAA Division I school located in Boone, North Carolina. He earned himself a spot on the Southern Conference (SoCon) All-Freshmen Team after helping the Mountaineers win the conference championship and qualify for an NCAA tournament berth.\nOver Payton's final three seasons he earned all-conference honors in each of them: Second Team All-SoCon as a sophomore, then back-to-back First Teams in his junior and senior years. In Payton's junior season of 1980–81, he led the league in points (17.1) and rebounds (10.7) per game as well as field goal percentage (63.3%). Appalachian State would also tie for first place in Payton's junior season, but because the Mountaineers did not win the SoCon tournament, they did not earn a postseason bid. For his outstanding season he was named the SoCon Player of the Year.\nAfter his collegiate career ended following the 1981–82 season, Payton played professionally in Portugal and England before moving to Austria. He spent the majority of his international career in the country.\nPersonal life.\nCharles Payton's son, Kevin Payton, played basketball at the University of Minnesota from 2004 to 2008. The Payton family are residents of Vienna, Austria."

        "text": "The 2014 Super Rugby season is the fourth season of the 15-team format for the Super Rugby competition involving teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. For sponsorship reasons, this competition is known as Asteron Life Super Rugby in Australia, Investec Super Rugby in New Zealand and Vodacom Super Rugby in South Africa. Including its past incarnations as Super 12 and Super 14, this is the 19th season for the Southern Hemisphere's premier transnational club competition. The conference games will take place every weekend from 15 February until 12 July (with a three-week break between rounds 16 and 17 for internationals games), followed by the finals series, culminating in the grand final on 2 August. The winners of the 2014 Super Rugby Season were the New South Wales Waratahs.\nCompetition format.\nCovering 24 weeks, the schedule features a total of 125 matches. The 15 teams are grouped by geography, labelled the Australian Conference, New Zealand Conference and the South African Conference. The regular season consists of two types of matches:\nThe top team of each conference, plus the next top three teams in table points regardless of conference (wild card teams), will move on to the finals. The top two conference winners, based on table points, receive first-round byes. In the first round of the finals, the third conference winner is the #3 seed and hosts the wild card team with the worst record, and the best wild card team hosts the second-best wild card team. In the semi-finals, the #2 conference winner hosts the higher surviving seed from the first round, and the #1 conference winner hosts the other first-round winner. The final is hosted by the top remaining seed.\nThe two-legged promotion/relegation play-off initially scheduled between the bottom team in the South African Conference and the Southern Kings was abolished following a meeting on 13 February 2014.\nStandings.\nConference leaders and wildcard teams qualified to the finals. The top six teams qualified to the finals, with their final positions in the overall log determining their seedings in the finals. The third-placed team (i.e. the conference winners with the worst overall record) will host the sixth-placed team in the qualifiers, while the fourth-placed team will host the fifth-placed team. The top two teams (i.e. the two conference winners with the best overall record) will qualify directly to the semi-finals, where they will have home advantage against the two qualifier winners, with the top team hosting the qualifier winner with the lower seeding and the second-placed team hosting the qualifier winner with the higher seeding. The two semi-final winners will progress to the final, with the team with the higher seeding having home advantage.\nPoints breakdown: 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 bonus point for a loss by seven points or less, 1 bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match.\nClassification: Teams standings are calculated as follows: Conference Leaders (i.e. conference leaders will always be ranked in the top three), Log points, Number of games won, Overall points difference, Number of tries scored, Overall try difference\nKey:\nFixtures.\nThe following fixtures were released 7 October 2013.\nPlayers.\nPlayer statistics.\nThe following table contain points which have been scored in competitive games in the 2014 Super Rugby season.\nSquad lists.\nThe teams released the following squad lists:\nReferees.\nThe following refereeing panel was appointed by SANZAR for the 2014 Super Rugby season:\nPrior to Round 7, Jason Jaftha, James Leckie, Francisco Pastrana and Lourens van der Merwe were removed from the refereeing panel, Jaftha due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury that would see him miss four months of the season and the latter three in a move by SANZAR to recognise \"who has performed to expectation and who has not.\""

        "title": "2013–14 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2013–14 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They were led by John Thompson III, were members of the Big East Conference, and played their home games at the Verizon Center, with one home game at McDonough Gymnasium. The team started the season against the Oregon Ducks in the Armed Forces Classic at Camp Humphreys near Pyeongtaek, South Korea, and played in the 2013 Puerto Rico Tip-Off.\nThis was Georgetowns first season as a member of the newly organized Big East Conference. It had been a founding member of the original Big East Conference in the 1979-80 season and had remained a member for 34 seasons. However, that conferences increasingly unstable membership and uncertain future and what Georgetown and the conferences other basketball-only members believed to be its focus on college football at the expense of the interests of its basketball programs led Georgetown and six other Big East members (DePaul, Marquette, Providence, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Villanova) to leave the conference after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. In 2013 they joined Butler, Creighton, and Xavier in forming a new Big East Conference. (The original Big East Conference then added new members of its own and renamed itself the American Athletic Conference for the 2013–14 season.) One immediate effect of the conference realignment was that for the first time since the 1977-78 season the Hoyas did not play Syracuse, Georgetowns great rival throughout the original Big East Conferences 34-season history; Syracuse had itself left the original Big East in 2013 to join the Atlantic Coast Conference for the 2013–14 season.\nSeason recap.\nFollowing the previous season, Georgetown sophomore forward Otto Porter Jr. had left the team for a career in the National Basketball Association after two impressive collegiate years in which he had led the team in virtually all statistical categories, and the Hoyas keenly felt his loss. Without any seniors on the team the previous year, however, Georgetown had lost no players to graduation over the offseason, and the only player to transfer from Georgetown, then-freshman center Brandon Bolden, had had virtually no playing time during his only season as a Hoya. Georgetown returned the rest of its veteran players, with senior Markel Starks at point guard; sophomore D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera at shooting guard; junior Jabril Trawick at guard; senior Nate Lubick, redshirt senior Aaron Bowen, junior Mikael Hopkins, and sophomore Stephen Domingo at forward; and senior Moses Ayegba and sophomore Bradley Hayes at center. Sophomore guard David Allen made the team as a walk-on for the second straight season, sophomore guard Riyan Williams – the son of former Georgetown great Reggie Williams – also walked on and was added to the roster in January 2014, the third time in Georgetown men's basketball history that the son of a former Georgetown player made the team. Senior guard John Caprio, a walk-on in his first three seasons, made the team as a scholarship player for the first and only time. Junior forward Greg Whittington, who had been Georgetown's second-leading scorer and rebounder of the 2012–13 season before he was suspended for academic reasons at midseason and missed the last 19 games of the year, also returned, but he had undergone knee surgery over the offseason and began the 2013-14 campaign sidelined while he recovered. Junior center Tyler Adams, sidelined early in his freshman season by heart arrhythmia, spent the season on a medical hardship waiver that allowed him to continue at Georgetown on a scholarship without counting against the team's scholarship total; relegated to the bench for another year, he made the most of the situation, acting as a \"de facto\" assistant coach.\nThe Hoyas welcomed two new players for 2013–14. Power forward Reggie Cameron joined the team as its only freshman, but most attention centered around its only other newcomer, junior center Joshua Smith, who joined Georgetown as a transfer from UCLA. In his freshman year at UCLA in 2010–11, Smith averaged 10.9 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. By his sophomore season in 2011–12, however, he had lost the confidence of Bruins head coach Ben Howland, who believed the 6-foot-10 (208 cm) Smith to be overweight and out of shape – Smith arrived for his sophomore season weighing 350 pounds (159 kg) – and had criticized publicly what he saw as immature behavior on Smith's part; Howland did not give Smith much playing time during his sophomore season, as Smith tired easily and played for only two or three minutes at a time, and he averaged only 17.2 minutes per game for the year. After playing in only six games for the Bruins during his junior year in 2012–13, Smith left UCLA in midseason, transferring in January 2013 to Georgetown, where he began taking classes and practicing with the team during the spring 2013 semester. Normally, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) would have required Smith to sit out two entire semesters before making his Hoya debut, and would have granted him only one more year of eligibility, but Georgetown requested a seasons-of-competition waiver from the NCAA, which the NCAA granted, in effect making a controversial decision to give Smith the same status as a redshirt junior and allow him to begin play for the Hoyas with the opening game of the 2013–14 season and with two years of eligibility remaining. Thompson, who had recruited Smith in high school, expected Smith and his low-post offensive presence to play a key role for the Hoyas and constructed a team that could take advantage of his presence. Thompson told the press that signing Smith was \"a big risk – literally and figuratively\" because of his declining performance during his time at UCLA and questions about his commitment to physical fitness and to playing winning basketball, but that the risk was worth it if Smith worked hard and stayed in shape because of his footwork, agility, and soft hands. Thompson noted that Smith had made a good start with the Hoyas, arriving for the fall 2013 semester in good physical shape.\nNonconference schedule.\nUnranked Georgetown began its season with a ranked opponent, No. 19 Oregon, in the Armed Forces Classic and in an unusual venue, Camp Humphreys, a United States Army base in South Korea located south of Seoul, with an audience consisting almost entirely of U.S. Army soldiers who cheered enthusiastically for both teams. Both teams wore special camouflage uniforms, the Ducks light-colored ones with \"USA\" on their backs instead of the players' names and the Hoyas dark-colored ones sporting inspiring words like \"Courage,\" \"Integrity,\" and \"Respect\" rather than players' names, and the coaches and staff of both teams wore combat boots and military-style cargo pants. Georgetown took its only lead of the first half by scoring the opening basket, but after that shot poorly and committed turnovers repeatedly, allowing Oregon to build a lead, although the Hoyas battled back to a 37–34 deficit at halftime behind 10 points by Mikael Hopkins and nine first-half points by Joshua Smith. The Hoyas briefly took their second and final lead of the game early in the second half, but Oregon soon pulled ahead for good, although Georgetown closed to within four points with a minute left in the game. Ultimately, the Hoyas missed important free throws and the Ducks made their free throws in the final minutes, and Oregon won 82–75. The Hoyas went only 1-for-15 (6.7 percent) from three-point range and Oregon outrebounded them 40–32. Joshua Smith scored a game-high 25 points – also his season high, as it turned out – but grabbed only four rebounds, Markel Starks made Georgetown's only three-pointer with 7:16 left in the game and finished with 16 points, Jabril Trawick had 11 points, and Mikael Hopkins contributed 10. Oregon's 82 points were more than any opponent had scored against Georgetown the previous season.\nThe Hoyas made a brief return to Washington, D.C., to defeat Wright State in their home opener at the Verizon Center, with D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scoring 25 points and Starks contributing 23. Reggie Cameron scored on each of the first three three-point attempts of his collegiate career to finish with nine points as the Hoyas' three-point game recovered from its dismal showing in South Korea on 10-for-22 (45 percent) shooting from beyond the arc. Georgetown then went on the road again to take part in the Puerto Rico Tip-Off in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In the opening game of the tournament, Georgetown faced Northeastern – a team the Hoyas had faced only once before, in 1979 – and suffered an upset at the hands of the Huskies, leading by 11 points at the half but collapsing in the second half, shooting 23 percent from the field after halftime, struggling at the free-throw line throughout the game, and allowing Northeastern to come from behind for a 63–56 win. Relegated to the tournament's consolation bracket, the Hoyas had a much better outing against Kansas State the following day, shooting 63 percent from the field and leading by as many as 29 points before coming away with a 90–63 victory. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was the only Hoya to score in double figures against Northeastern with 14 points and scored a game-high 25 points against Kansas State, while Jabil Trawick had 16, Joshua Smith 13, and Markel Starks 11 points against the Wildcats.\nGeorgetown advanced to the tournament's fifth-place game to face its second ranked opponent of the season, No. 10 VCU, which had suffered an upset loss to Florida State in its tournament opener and defeated Long Beach State to advance to meet the Hoyas. In the most recent previous meeting between the schools, VCU had knocked Georgetown out of the 2011 NCAA tournament, outrunning and blowing out the Hoyas. This time, Georgetown scored the game's first eight points in a fast-paced first half, but VCU used a pressure defense to force Georgetown into 14 first-half turnovers, scoring 15 points off them. The Rams also made the most of a big advantage in first-half free throw opportunities, going 14-for-15 (93 percent) from the line compared to Georgetown's 2-for-3. Despite this, the Hoyas handled the Rams' pressure well, and there were five lead changes in the first half, with VCU enjoying its biggest lead of the half at 26–20 but going into the locker room clinging to a 30–29 lead. In the second half, VCU had back-to-back takeaways as part of an 8–0 run to take a 48–41 lead with 14 minutes left in the game, but Georgetown came back to lead 67–60 with 4:20 remaining. Jabril Trawick fouled out on the next Georgetown possession, costing the Hoyas some of their quickness, but Georgetown held the lead at 69–63. Then VCU mounted a comeback, and Georgetown's lead shrank to 81–78 with 14.1 seconds left and 83–80 with 1.8 seconds to play, but the Hoyas finished the game with a free throw to come away with an 84–80 upset win and a fifth-place finish in the 2013 Puerto Rico Tip-Off. The game lasted nearly three hours, with 61 fouls called. The Hoyas outshot the Rams from the field 56 to 35 percent and went 6-for-11 (55 percent) from three-point range. Smith-Rivera scored a game-high 26 points and went 5-for-6 from the free-throw line, Markel Starks was 10-for-10 in free throws and scored 23 points, and Joshua Smith had 17 points.\nAfter playing four of their first five games outside the continental United States, the Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center for a four-game homestand. A harbinger of roster problems that would plague Georgetown for much of the season came on the homestand's first day, when John Thompson III announced just before the tip-off on November 30 against Lipscomb – the first meeting of the schools – that junior forward Greg Whittington – who had not played since January 8, 2013, because of an academic suspension, missing the final 19 games of the 2012–13 season, and had suffered an injury over the summer of 2013 that required knee surgery and prevented him from playing at all during the 2013–2014 season – had been dismissed from the team for unspecified reasons. The Hoyas swept the homestand to extend their winning streak to six games. During the homestand, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 17 points each against Lipscomb and High Point, and 19 against Elon, while Markel Starks scored 18 against High Point, 12 against Colgate, and 21 against Elon. Joshua Smith scored 14 each against Lipscomb and Colgate and contributed 11 against High Point and 18 in the Elon game. Mikael Hopkins came off the bench to score 13 against Lipscomb and to contribute nine points and eight rebounds in the Colgate game. Against Colgate, Nate Lubick scored in double figures for the first time in the season with 10 points, and he followed up with another 10 points against Elon. Against High Point, the Hoyas tied their season high with 10 three-pointers, but against Elon they allowed the Phoenix to go 8-for-17 in three-pointers, the first time all season they had allowed an opponent to attempt more than seven three-point shots. The Hoyas' victory over Colgate was their eighth in nine meetings between the schools, but the six-point win was so tight that an annoyed John Thompson III refused to let his players discuss it with the media, saying they had not earned the right to speak about the game.\nGeorgetown next went back on the road to face its third ranked opponent of the season, No. 18 Kansas, which had a 66-game winning streak on its home court against non-conference opponents. The Hoyas employed a zone defense to try to counter Kansas's athleticism and height, but had difficulty defending inside. In the first half, the Jayhawks put on a strong defensive effort that helped them go on a 14–3 run and the Hoyas at one point went minutes without a field goal, missing five straight shots while committing a turnover and a shot clock violation. The Hoyas played a very physical game, but this backfired as Georgetown players got in foul trouble; by halftime, when Kansas led 44–34, Moses Ayegba and Nate Lubick each had three fouls and Joshua Smith was among three other Hoyas with two, and Smith quickly picked up a third foul at the beginning of the second half and had to spend long stretches on the bench for the remainder of the game. Kansas extended its lead to 56–38 with 12:57 left to play before Georgetown closed to a 59–47 deficit halfway through the second half on a Jabril Trawick basket that almost caused a fight between the teams when Trawick fouled Jayhawks small forward Andrew Wiggins hard. A 10–3 Jayhawks run followed that put Kansas ahead 69–50 with 7:10 to play. Georgetown never got within 18 points again as Kansas continued to build its lead. Joshua Smith, averaging 14.1 points per game, fouled out after scoring only five points and Moses Ayegba and Nate Lubick also fouled out before Kansas won the game 86–64, extending its home winning streak against non-conference opponents to 67. Markel Starks with 19 points and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera with 12 were the only two Hoyas to score in double digits.\nA week later, Georgetown rounded out the non-conference portion of its schedule with an easy home win over FIU, improving its all-time record against FIU to 4–0 and extending its winning streak at the Verizon Center against non-conference opponents to 49. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, Markel Starks, and Nate Lubick each scored 15 points against FIU, and Georgetown entered conference play three days later with a record of 8–3.\nConference schedule.\nAlthough Georgetown was a member of the Big East Conference, it was not the storied conference the Hoyas had joined as a charter member in 1979. The original Big East Conference still existed, but under a new name, as the American Athletic Conference – marketed as \"the American\" – and Georgetown this season was a charter member of an entirely new conference also named the Big East. Both the new Big East and the American claimed the history and heritage of the original Big East as their own, and the new Big East had many aspects that were reminiscent of the old Big East. Like the old conference in its early days, the new Big East was a basketball-only conference that played a regular-season schedule made up of each team hosting and visiting each other team once – something that had become impractical in the old conference as it expanded in the interest of college football programs – and it also maintained the old Big East's tradition of holding its conference championship tournament, the Big East tournament, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The new conference also included traditional Georgetown foes; among schools that had transferred from the old conference to the new one were three other charter members of the original conference (Providence, St. John's, and Seton Hall) and a second-season addition to the old Big East (Villanova), as well as two schools that had joined the old Big East more recently (DePaul and Marquette). However, other aspects of the new conference were quite different from the old one. Three of its members (Butler, Creighton, and Xavier) had no association at all with the original Big East, and two of them were among the better teams in the conference in its first year, while Georgetown-St. John's meetings lacked the national notability they had enjoyed in the old conference's heyday. Moreover, Georgetown would no longer face traditional foes such as Connecticut – a charter member of the original Big East which remained in the American, not on Georgetown's schedule for the first time since the 1979-80 season – and Pittsburgh – a fourth-season addition to the old conference which had joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and was not on Georgetown's schedule for the first time since the 1981-82 season. Most notably, archrival Syracuse (which also had joined the ACC) was no longer on Georgetown's schedule, missing from it for the first time since the 1978-79 season. Both the new Big East and Georgetown felt the absence of Syracuse particularly keenly because of the role the Georgetown-Syracuse rivalry had played in the original Big East throughout its 34-season history. As the new Big East began play, media observers opined that the new conference was weaker on the court than the old one and lacked the luster of its predecessor and would have to build new rivalries and a new history of its own if it was to prevail in the sports marketplace.\nThe new Big East Conference began play with a full slate of five games on December 31, 2013, and Georgetown – picked pre-season by the conference's coaches to finish second in the Big East – started its first season in the new conference at the Verizon Center with its 13th straight win over DePaul, a game in which Markel Starks had a game-high 21-point performance and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 12. The Hoyas followed that with their 100th game against St. John's, beating the Red Storm easily for the sixth time in a row and preserving a home winning streak against St. John's that dated back to January 18, 2003. The Hoyas improved their record in the all-time series with St. John's – which began in the 1909-1910 season – to 47–53 as D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 31 points, shooting 9-for-12 (75 percent) from the field overall and 6-for-7 (86 percent) from three-point range, and Markel Starks contributed 12 points.\nJoshua Smith had scored 25 points against Oregon, 17 points against VCU, and 11 or more points in six straight games and in double figures in seven games to start the season, but his performance then began to decline. Against Kansas, FIU, and DePaul he scored no more than five points in any game, and against St. John's he missed five of his six shots. Despite Smith's declining performance, he was the Hoyas' third-leading scorer for the season as of the completion of the St. John's game on January 4, averaging 11.6 points per game, and with him on the court the Hoyas had gone 10–3 in their first 13 games. Georgetown thus suffered a major blow to its roster on January 8 when Smith did not accompany the team for its third conference game, a road game at Providence. Georgetown officials revealed that Smith would not play again until he resolved an academic issue, and, after he had continued to struggle in his classes, Georgetown announced on January 24 that he had been dismissed from the team and would not play for the remainder of the 2013–14 season, but would return for the 2014-2015 season if his academic performance improved enough by then. With Smith out, Thompson was forced to move power forward Mikael Hopkins to center and play Reggie Cameron and Nate Lubick at forward, giving the Hoyas an undersized and less experienced front court. Facing a Providence team on the evening of January 8 that had lost three games in a row, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 19 points and Hopkins had 12, but the revamped Georgetown line-up fared poorly in an 18-point loss to the Friars. The loss broke a nine-game Georgetown winning streak over Providence that dated back to March 2005 and a three-game Hoya winning streak at the Dunkin Donuts Center. Georgetown also lost another player during the game when Jabril Trawick suffered a broken jaw, forcing him to miss the next five games.\nAlthough the Hoyas bounced back for an overtime win at Butler in which D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 18 points, Markel Starks had 15, and Aaron Bowen came off the bench to score 11, handing the Bulldogs their fourth straight loss, Georgetown and its depleted roster then went into a tailspin, losing at Xavier, at home against Seton Hall and at home in overtime against Marquette, and at Creighton. At Xavier, Markel Starks scored 19 points, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 18 for the second straight game, and Reggie Cameron scored in double digits for the first time in his collegiate career with a 13-point performance, and as a team the Hoyas tied their season record by connecting on 10 three-pointers, but the Hoyas blew a 17-point lead with 15 minutes to play, failing to score during the game's final six minutes. The pattern repeated itself three days later, when Seton Hall overcame a 10-point deficit in the second half and held the Hoyas scoreless over the last 9:44 of the game to beat Georgetown. It was Seton Hall's first defeat of Georgetown in a game in Washington since an overtime victory on January 29, 2003, and the first one in regulation since January 8, 2000; against the Pirates, Smith-Rivera had 14 points, Aaron Bowen came off the bench to score 13, and Mikael Hopkins contributed 11. The game with Marquette broke a string of seven straight games between the schools in which at least one of the teams had been in the Top 25, and Marquette – picked pre-season to win the Big East and, like the Hoyas, falling well short of expectations – arrived winless on the road in Big East play for the season, but the Hoyas blew a seven-point lead with three minutes to play and the Golden Eagles outscored them 15–7 in overtime. Markel Starks had a career-high 28 points and Smith-Rivera had 24, while Mikael Hopkins contributed 11 rebounds and six points against Marquette. In the loss at first-place Creighton five nights later before a school-record crowd of 18,859 at CenturyLink Center Omaha, Starks had 21 points, Smith-Rivera had 18, and Hopkins had 14, and Nate Lubick pulled down 10 rebounds, but the Hoyas shot 39 percent from the field; it was their third sub-40-percent performance in a row.\nLosers of four in a row and five of their last six, the Hoyas came home to host the first ranked opponent of their conference season, No. 9 Villanova. Their depleted roster received a reinforcement for the game when Jabril Trawick returned to action; he had recovered more quickly than expected from his broken jaw and missed only five games because of the injury, and he played 12 minutes against the Wildcats. But John Thompson III also had to deal with another player loss, when back-up center Moses Ayegba received a one-game NCAA suspension less than three hours before game time because of a pre-enrollment infraction. The game had no flow, with the teams combining for 34 turnovers (18 by Georgetown) and 39 fouls to go with their 41 field goals. Amid the frequent stoppages of play, Georgetown scored the game's first eight points, giving the Hoyas what turned out to be their largest lead of the game. The Wildcats took advantage of a big disparity in free throw opportunities, going 22-for-28 (79 percent) from the line while Georgetown went 8-for-9 (89 percent). Villanova led 35–30 at the half, but Georgetown came back repeatedly to tie the game in the second half at 35–35, 37–37, 39–39, and 43–43 before Villanova pulled ahead for good with 10:04 to play. The Wildcats stretched their lead to as many as five points, but the Hoyas closed to 61–58 with 2:08 remaining before Villanova used free throws to close out a 65–60 victory. Markel Starks had 20 points for the Hoyas and Reggie Cameron had 12, but the Hoyas went down to their fifth straight defeat, tying the longest losing streak of John Thompson III's ten-season tenure at Georgetown set in 2011; it also was their third straight home loss, giving them their longest home losing streak since 2009. They had lost six of the seven games they played after Joshua Smith's departure and seven of their last eleven.\nGeorgetown's next game was a non-conference affair against seventh-ranked Michigan State – its second Top-Ten opponent of the year – at Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 1, 2014; preceded by a game between Marquette and St. John's, it was the second game of the \"Super Saturday Hoops\" doubleheader celebrating the following day's Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey. The two teams had met only once previously, when the Spartans knocked the Hoyas out of the 1986 NCAA tournament in its second round. Michigan State came into the game with a record of 19–2 and was a heavy favorite despite playing with a front court weakened by injuries to senior center Adreian Payne and junior guard Branden Dawson. Trailing 30–29 at halftime, the Hoyas began the second half with an 11–2 run to take a 40–32 lead with 14:26 remaining in the game. Sophomore guard Gary Harris scored a game-high 20 points for the Spartans, and his three-pointer with 1:32 left reduced Georgetown's lead to 56–54. Jabril Trawick then made two key plays, tipping in a missed shot to give Georgetown a 58–54 lead and soon afterwards scoring on a breakaway dunk to give the Hoyas a 63–55 advantage. The Hoyas, who shot only 2-for-12 (16.7 percent) from three-point range but 22-for-49 (44.9 percent) from the field overall, held the Spartans to 39.3 percent shooting from the field, and became only the fourth team to outrebound Michigan State during the season, 37–30. Markel Starks led Georgetown with 16 points, D'Vautes Smith-Rivera scored 12, Trawick had eight, and the Georgetown front court had a strong game with Lubick scoring eight points as Georgetown broke its losing streak with a shocking 64–60 upset of Michigan State and defeated a ranked opponent for the second time during the season.\nThe victory over Michigan State raised hopes that Georgetown's season would turn around, and it began a four-game winning streak for the Hoyas, who returned to conference play and \nentered a stretch in which they played a number of the Big East's struggling teams. First, they won at DePaul two days later – Georgetown's 14th straight win over the Blue Demons, a streak dating back to January 22, 1994 – and then they came home to defeat Butler and Providence. Against DePaul, Markel Starks shot only 6-for-18 (33 percent) from the field, but he hit three three-pointers and 11 of his 14 free throws (79 percent) to finish with a game-high 26 points, while Trawick had 15 points, Nate Lubick grabbed 10 rebounds to go with his three points, and Smith-Rivera – mired in a 4-for-24 (17 percent) shooting slump from the field in Georgetown's previous two games and an 0-for-5 showing in the first half against DePaul – went 3-for-6 in the second half and scored 17 points. In the Butler game – in which Georgetown turned the ball over only seven times for the second straight game and won despite a career-high 24 points by Bulldog freshman forward Andrew Chrabascz – Starks led the team with 19 points, Smith-Rivera added 18, and Lubick scored 10 while pulling down nine rebounds. Despite 31 points by Providence senior guard Bryce Cotton, the Hoyas came from behind to deal the Friars their third consecutive loss as Smith-Rivera, who had missed 17 straight three-pointers going into the game, went 2-for-4 from beyond the arc and scored 22 points, Starks contributed 14, Reggie Cameron had 11, and Mikael Hopkins grabbed 11 rebounds and scored eight. By the end of the Providence game, the Hoyas had evened their conference record at 6–6 – putting them back in contention for a possible bid to the 2014 NCAA tournament – although four of those wins had come against the two teams with the worst records in the Big East, Butler and DePaul.\nGeorgetown's hopes for greater success late in the season dimmed after two straight one-sided road losses to St. John's and Seton Hall that followed the winning streak. Freshman guard Rysheed Jordan scored a career-high 24 points against the Hoyas, who got into foul trouble, to lead the Red Storm to its eighth win in nine games, despite 15 points by Smith-Rivera and 13 each by Starks and Trawick. Four days later, the Pirates broke a three-game losing streak, winning for only the fourth time in 12 games, and completed their first season sweep of the Hoyas since the 2002–2003 season, with Smith-Rivera scoring 20, Starks 13, and Trawick 11 in a losing cause. It was only the third time since the creation of the original Big East Conference in 1979 that Seton Hall had swept Georgetown in a season, and the back-to-back losses dropped Georgetown to 6–8 in Big East play, with a tougher part of their schedule looming to close out the regular season. The Hoyas never led during the two losses.\nThe Hoyas bounced back for a 74–52 home win against Xavier in which they never trailed, ending up with their most decisive victory in a Big East game since a 61–39 defeat of Syracuse on March 9, 2013. Jabril Trawick made his first start since breaking his jaw on January 8 and scored 13 points, while Markel Starks had a game-high 22. However, another loss followed in a visit to Marquette five days later, as the Hoyas missed two layups in the final seconds and the Golden Eagles won 75–73, their fifth victory in six games. Starks led the Hoyas with 24 points against Marquette, while Smith-Rivera had a 19-point performance and Trawick contributed 16.\nGeorgetown completed its regular season with games against two ranked conference opponents. The penultimate game was against No. 13 Creighton, with four Georgetown seniors playing in their final home game. During halftime Georgetown announced that its new on-campus athletic center would be named the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, after John Thompson Jr., the Hoyas' head coach from 1972 to 1999 and father of John Thompson III and of former Georgetown player Ronny Thompson. The Hoyas shot 54 percent from the field and Aaron Bowen and Mikael Hopkins limited the highest-scoring college player in the United States, Bluejays senior forward Doug McDermott – averaging 26 points per game for the season – to 9-for-23 shooting (39 percent) in field goal attempts and 4-of-11 (36 percent) from three-point range, and overall Creighton shot only 40 percent from the field and 10-for-29 (34 percent) in three-point attempts. The Hoyas jumped out to a 42–28 advantage at halftime. and early in the second half widened their lead to 16. Although McDermott scored 16 of his 22 points and made nine of his 12 rebounds – giving him a double-double – in the second half, the Bluejays never got closer than five points, closing to 66–61 with 1:42 left to play. After that, Georgetown pulled away again for a 75–63 upset victory. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera and Markel Starks had Georgetown's first double-doubles of the season, Smith-Rivera scoring 18 points and grabbing a career-high 12 rebounds and Starks finishing with 17 points and a career-best 11 assists, while Jabril Trawick had 15 points and seven rebounds and Mikael Hopkins contributed 10 points.\nHoping for a first-round bye in the new Big East's championship tournament and to enhance its case for an NCAA Tournament bid, Georgetown traveled to meet No. 6 Villanova to close out the regular season. However, the Wildcats dominated the Hoyas, winning 77–59. The 18-point win was Villanova's largest over Georgetown since Villanova joined the original Big East Conference for the 1980-1981 season; it also gave Villanova its first 16-win conference season in school history. Markel Starks scored a game-high 20 points, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera added 19, and Aaron Bowen came off the bench to score 13 against Villanova. Georgetown finished the regular season in seventh place in the Big East, with an 8-10 conference record and a 17–13 record overall. It was Georgetown's first losing conference record since the 2008-2009 season, and the seventh-place finish meant that the Hoyas would not get a bye in the first round of the conference championship tournament.\nBig East tournament.\nSeeded seventh in the 2014 Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden and hoping a run to the tournament championship game would earn them an NCAA Tournament bid, the Hoyas met the conference's last-place team, 10th-seeded DePaul, in the tournament's first round. The Blue Demons had lost 12 of their last 13 games, including a 79–46 blowout by Butler in their last regular-season game, and Georgetown was the decided favorite to win. Georgetown led 25–23 at halftime but DePaul took a 28–27 lead with 18:39 left in the second half. The teams traded leads until a Markel Starks jumper put the Hoyas ahead 40–36 with 12:22 to play, but DePaul came back and retook the lead at 43–40 with 9:16 remaining. The game was tied at 45–45 with 6:40 remaining when DePaul went on a decisive 8–0 run to pull ahead 53–45. The Hoyas closed to 58–56 on a Jabril Trawick layup with eight seconds left, but DePaul freshman guard Billy Garrett Jr. sank two free throws with six seconds left and DePaul upset Georgetown 60–56. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera went only 5-for-14 (35.7 percent) from the field but made all 10 free throws he attempted to finish with a game-high 21 points and Markel Starks had a 17-point game, but the other seven Georgetown players who appeared in the game combined for only 18 points. Overall, Georgetown went only 5-for-17 (29.4 percent) from three-point range. It was only the second victory the Blue Demons had ever had in a Big East tournament and the first since 2009, and it was the first time they had beaten the Hoyas since January 22, 1994, bringing a 14-game Georgetown winning streak against DePaul over a period of 20 years to an end. DePaul head coach Oliver Purnell won his first game against Georgetown in seven tries and first Big East tournament game in four tries. It was the first time Georgetown had lost its first game of a Big East tournament since receiving a first-round bye and losing in the second round in 2011, as well as the Hoyas' first loss in the tournament's first round since 2009. Ousting Georgetown from the tournament, DePaul moved on to face No. 14 Creighton in the quarterfinals the next day.\nNational Invitation Tournament.\nWith a 17–14 record and having lost five of their last seven games, the Hoyas did not receive an invitation to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2009, and instead accepted a bid to the 2014 National Invitation Tournament, the third and final Georgetown NIT appearance of the John Thompson III era and the first since 2009. Seeded fourth in one of the NIT's regions, their first opponent was fifth-seeded West Virginia, a former foe in the original Big East until the Mountaineers left after the 2011-2012 season to join the Big 12 Conference, and it was the first meeting of the schools since West Virginia's change of conferences. With the Verizon Center booked by the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Georgetown hosted West Virginia at McDonough Gymnasium, its first on-campus game since 2009, before a boisterous crowd of students. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had his second double-double of the season with a career-high 32 points and 10 rebounds, while Markel Starks had 14 points and grabbed a career-high seven rebounds and Jabril Trawick scored 12 points. The Hoyas shot only 37 percent from the field in the first half and went into the locker room at the half down 33–30, but they returned to shoot 52 percent from the field in the second half. After a decisive 8–0 Georgetown run early in the second half, the Hoyas took their first double-digit lead on a Nate Lubick dunk with 6:18 left to play on the way to a 77–65 win. It was their first win in a postseason tournament since the 2012 NCAA tournament and their first win in the NIT since 2005.\nGeorgetown advanced to the second round, visiting the region's No. 1 seed, Florida State, which had defeated Florida Gulf Coast in the first round. None of the defenses the Hoyas tried against Florida State was effective, and the Seminoles closed out the first half with a 15–5 run that gave them a 48–35 lead at halftime from which Georgetown never recovered. The Seminoles shot a season-best 68.2 percent from the field, including 68.8 percent from three-point range, and won 101–90, bringing Georgetown's season to an end. It was Florida State's first 100-plus-point game since a 106–62 win against Charlotte on December 17, 2013, and the first time Georgetown had allowed an opponent to score 100 or more points since the 2000-2001 season. Markel Starks ended his Georgetown career with a team-leading 27 points, while D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 22, Jabril Trawick added 14, and Aaron Bowen had 10 points. Florida State advanced to meet third-seeded Louisiana Tech in the third round.\nWrap-up.\nMarkel Starks finished the season having started all 33 games, and was Georgetown's second-leading scorer for the year with 17.3 points per game, shooting 46.7 percent from the field, 32.6 percent from three-point range, and 87.0 percent from the free-throw line, and he averaged 2.3 rebounds per game. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was the team's leading scorer, averaging in double figures for the season, with 17.6 points per game; he played in all 33 games, starting all but one of them, with a field-goal percentage of 44.5 percent, 39.3 percent shooting from beyond the arc, and 87.3 percent in free throws, and he averaged 5.0 rebounds per game. In 28 appearances and 21 starts, Jabril Trawick averaged 9.1 points per game on 51.9 percent field-goal shooting, 31.3 percent in three-pointers, with 3.1 rebounds per game, and Aaron Bowen, playing all 33 games including one start, shot 49.4 percent from the field and averaged 6.0 points and 3.7 rebounds. Mikael Hopkins started 20 games and played in all 33, and he averaged 6.0 points and 4.9 rebounds, while Nate Lubick, who played in every game and started all but one, averaging 5.1 points per game on 58.2-percent shooting, and also pulled down 5.4 rebounds per game. Moses Ayegba made 31 appearances, one of them a start, and averaged 1.9 points per game. In his abbreviated season, Joshua Smith started all 13 games he played in, averaging 11.5 points and 3.4 rebounds per game and shooting 65.5 percent from the field.\nMarkel Starks, Nate Lubick, Moses Ayegba, and John Caprio all graduated after the season. Starks finished his four-year Georgetown career having appeared in 126 games, starting 89 of them, shooting 42.7 percent from the field, 35.9 percent in three-pointers, and 81.3 percent in free throws, averaging 9.9 points and 1.6 rebounds per game; he went undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, but went on to play professionally overseas. Lubick completed his four years at Georgetown having appeared in 130 games, starting 109 of them, shooting 56.5 percent from the field with 4.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Ayegba, who had only played for three years at Georgetown, had a year of collegiate eligibility remaining, and he decided in April 2014 to transfer to Nebraska to play one more season of college basketball. Although a redshirt senior, Aaron Bowen still had a year of college eligibility remaining thanks to a freshman season cut short by surgery, and, although eligible to transfer without sitting out a season, he opted to return to Georgetown for the following season. Joshua Smith was another potential returnee, provided he improved his academic performance enough to be invited back. Stephen Domingo, having had little playing time in two seasons as a Hoya, announced in May 2014 that he was transferring to California, where he could begin play after sitting out the 2014-2015 season.\nThanks to suspensions, dismissals, and injuries, the shorthanded Hoyas had roster problems for most of the year, leading to a disappointing, up-and-down season; with a final record of 18–15, Georgetown had its least successful season since 2008-2009. Picked pre-season to finish second in the Big East, they finished seventh instead, their first losing season in either version of the Big East Conference since 2008–2009 and only their second losing conference season since the 2003-2004 season, with a first-round exit from the Big East tournament and an early exit from the NIT. It was only the second losing conference season of the John Thompson III era, and only the third time that a John Thompson III-coached Georgetown team missed the NCAA Tournament. The team went unranked in either national poll throughout the year, the first time that had happened since the 2003–2004 season. Georgetown's switch to the new and untested Big East Conference – less competitive during the season than its predecessor and lacking some of the old conference's luster and traditional match-ups – as well as the loss of the Hoyas' annual home game against archrival Syracuse, a dearth of nonconference home games against marquee opponents, and a mediocre Georgetown record all hurt attendance at Hoya games during the season, which dropped 20 percent from an average of 10,911 per game in 2012-2013 to 8,670 per game in 2013–2014.\nRoster.\nRiyan Williams, the son of Reggie Williams, joined the team as a walk-on this season and made the roster in January 2014. He became only the third son of a former player to play for Georgetown, and the first to do so since Patrick Ewing Jr., the son of Patrick Ewing, played for the Hoyas in the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 seasons. Before Ewing, the only son of a former player to have played on the team was Ed Hargaden Jr. – the son of Ed Hargaden, Georgetown's first All-American and star of the 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35 teams – who played for Georgetown during the 1957-58, 1958-59, and 1959-60 seasons.\n\"Notes: Greg Whittington was dismissed from the team in November 2013. Joshua Smith was suspended for the season in January 2014. Riyan Williams was added to the roster in January 2014.\"\nRankings.\nGeorgetown was not ranked in the Top 25, but was among other teams receiving Top 25 votes in the early weeks of the season.\nSource\nSchedule.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NIT"

        "title": "Dominic Smith (baseball)",
        "text": "Dominic David Rene Smith (born June 15, 1995) is an American professional baseball first baseman and left fielder for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Mets and Washington Nationals. He was selected by the Mets with the 11th overall pick of the 2013 MLB draft out of Junípero Serra High School in Gardena, California, and made his MLB debut in 2017. He bats and throws left-handed.\nEarly life.\nSmith participated in Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities and the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy in his youth. He attended Junípero Serra High School in Gardena, California, and played for the school's baseball team as a first baseman, outfielder, and pitcher. He led the Cavaliers to the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section division championship in 2013.\nSmith committed to attend the University of Southern California (USC).\nProfessional career.\nNew York Mets.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Mets selected Smith in the first round, with the eleventh overall selection, of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. Rather than attend USC, he signed with the Mets for a $2.6 million signing bonus. The Mets assigned Smith to the Gulf Coast Mets of the rookie–level Gulf Coast League (GCL), where he batted .287 with three home runs and 22 runs batted in (RBIs) in 48 games. He was subsequently promoted to the Kingsport Mets of the rookie-level Appalachian League, where he recorded four doubles in six at bats. At season's end, \"Baseball America\" named Smith as the 4th best prospect in the GCL for 2013. He spent the entire 2014 season with the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Single–A South Atlantic League. With just one home run, 44 RBIs and 77 strikeouts in 461 at bats, Smith fell way short of expectations.\nSmith got off to a slow start with the St. Lucie Mets of the High–A Florida State League (FSL) in 2015. He batted .143 with one double in his first sixteen games, and was 0-for-22 to start May. On May 12, Smith got his first extra base hit since Opening Day with a double against the Tampa Yankees. The 3-for-5 performance signaled a turn around for Smith, who compiled a sixteen-game hitting streak to raise his batting average to .260. For the month of June, Smith batted .352 with a FSL-leading 38 hits and 51 total bases. He also had the second most RBIs (20) and fifth most runs scored (15) to earn FSL Player of the Month honors. The hot hitting continued; Smith ended the season with a .305/.354/.417 slashline, and a career high six home runs. He led the league with 79 RBIs and 33 doubles on his way to being named FSL Player of the Year. After the season, he played for the Salt River Rafters of the Arizona Fall League.\nIn 2016, Smith played for the Binghamton Mets of the Double–A Eastern League, where he posted a .302 batting average with 14 home runs and 91 RBIs. He played in the 2016 All-Star Futures Game. The Mets assigned Smith to the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League to start the 2017 season.\n2017–2019.\nThe Mets promoted Smith to the major leagues on August 11, 2017 after Fernando Salas was designated for assignment. He made his debut that night against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, recording a single for his first hit off of Nick Pivetta. Smith hit his first home run off of Sonny Gray on August 15. He ended the 2017 season with a .198 batting average and nine home runs in 167 at bats for the Mets.\nIn spring training in 2018, Smith was set to compete with Adrián González to be the Mets' starting first baseman, but he missed most of spring training due to a quadriceps injury. He began the season in Las Vegas, and was promoted on May 11 when Jay Bruce went on the paternity list and demoted when Bruce returned on May 14. Smith was promoted again on June 11 when the Mets released Adrián González. Smith was demoted again on July 20 after Yoenis Céspedes was activated from the disabled list. In 2018 with the Mets he batted .224/.255/.420 in 143 at bats.\nDuring spring training in 2019, Smith resumed using a continuous positive airway pressure machine. Smith had been diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2016 when, during a sleep study, he stopped breathing 90 times per hour—a doctor told him that 30 breathing stoppages per hour would have been considered a severe case. He and Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen credited the treatment with making him more alert and productive on the field that spring.\nSmith made the opening day roster and split time between first base and left field in what was described as a \"breakout season.\" In late July, he was placed on the injured list (IL) with a stress fracture in his foot. On September 29, Smith returned from the IL in the last game of the Mets regular season. In his first at-bat back, he hit a three-run walk-off home run off Grant Dayton with the Mets down by two runs, leading the team to a 7–6 win in the bottom of the 11th inning over the Atlanta Braves.\n2020.\nIn the 2020 season, Smith received more playing time following Yoenis Cespedes' decision to opt out of the shortened season due to COVID-19-related concerns. For the second year in a row, he enjoyed what was described as a \"breakout season.\" He played in 50 of the team's 60 games batting .316/.377/.616 for the Mets with 21 doubles, 10 home runs and 42 RBIs in only 177 ABs. His .616 slugging percentage set a franchise record, albeit in a shortened season.\nFollowing the 2020 season, Smith was named one of the finalists for the Hank Aaron Award after registering an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .993, tied for fourth in the National League. Smith finished thirteenth in National League MVP Award voting. Writing for ESPN.com, Sam Miller named Smith the 25th-most entertaining player in baseball, describing him as \"one of the most engaging people in the sport.\"\n2021.\nIn 2021, Smith batted .244/.304/.363 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs in 145 games, while playing primarily left field. His 2021 season was universally considered a disappointing setback. A \"Sports Illustrated\" article on the season's biggest disappointments called him \"the team's least valuable player in 2021.\" An article on FanSided described him as looking \"like a shell of the player\" he was in 2020. An ESPN.com article described Smith and teammate Jeff McNeil as \"prime under-performers\". Greg Joyce wrote in the \"New York Post\" that \"Smith’s regression in 2021 clouded his future and role\" with the Mets.\nIn March 2022, he told reporters that he suffered a partially torn labrum in late May or early June 2021 but played through the injury, which affected his swing.\n2022.\nDuring the 2021–22 offseason, the Mets signed Mark Canha and Starling Marte to play the corner outfield positions and Pete Alonso was again slated to be the everyday first baseman. Smith reportedly was unhappy with his anticipated loss of playing time and the Mets discussed a trade to the San Diego Padres which ultimately fell through before the season began.\nSmith was not in the starting lineup on opening day, with the designated hitter role being assigned to J. D. Davis. In the team's first 50 games over the first two months of the season, Smith only started 22.\nAt the beginning of May when active rosters were reduced in size, Smith was among the candidates for release or demotion, at which point he was batting .167 with a .490 OPS. On May 1, 2022, however, Smith went 4-for-4 with a double and three runs batted in. The following day, the Mets made the decision to designate Robinson Canó for assignment and retain Smith on the active roster.\nOn May 19, 2022, Smith was batting .203 with a .552 OPS when he told \"Newsday\" that he wanted to play every day either for the Mets or for \"another team out there.\" Less than two weeks later, on May 31, the Mets announced that Smith was being demoted to Triple-A Syracuse in favor of reliever Adonis Medina. His batting average had fallen to .186 and his OPS to .543.\nSmith returned from his stint in Syracuse in late June in what he felt was a better headspace. However, his performance did not improve. After spraining his ankle in mid-July, he was placed on the injured list. The Mets acquired first baseman Daniel Vogelbach and outfielder Tyler Naquin shortly thereafter with the expectation that they would absorb much of the playing time which otherwise would have gone to Smith. During his time on the injured list, the Mets also traded for Darin Ruf to back up Pete Alonso at first base. On August 11, the Mets reinstated Smith from the injured list but optioned him to Triple-A.\nSmith said in August that he did not know whether the Mets would want to bring him back, given how poorly he had been performing in 2022. In 2022 with the Mets, he batted .194/.276/.284 with zero home runs in 134 at bats.\nOn November 18, 2022, the Mets declined to offer Smith a contract and he became a free agent, ending what was described in \"Newsday\" as a \"tumultuous stay\" and on MLB.com as an \"uneven tenure\" with the Mets.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn January 4, 2023, Smith signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Washington Nationals. In a career–high 153 games for Washington, he batted .254/.326/.366 with 12 home runs and 46 RBI. On November 14, Smith was designated for assignment after multiple prospects were added to the 40-man roster. He was non-tendered and became a free agent on November 17.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn February 19, 2024, Smith signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. On March 22, Smith was released by the Cubs after triggering the opt–out clause in his contract.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn March 30, 2024, Smith signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. He was released by the Rays on May 1.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn May 1, 2024, Smith signed a contract with the Boston Red Sox after opting out of his minor league contract and being released by the Rays organization.\nPersonal life.\nSmith's parents, Clay Smith and Yvette LaFleur, have seven children total. They lived separately while raising Dominic. His mother works in child care and his father is a dog trainer and groomer. Smith grew up a Los Angeles Angels fan.\nIn 2017, Smith founded a non-profit, Baseball Generations, which supports player development for financially underprivileged players.\nIn January 2022, Smith began seeing a therapist due to unspecified \"things off the field.\" At the recommendation of the therapist, he began journaling."

The program was created by John Young in 1989 in Los Angeles, and now serves more than 200 communities. In 2023, Nike, Inc. became the presenting sponsor.\nBackground.\nWorking as a scout for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) following his playing career, John Young noticed a lack of African American prospects. While working for the Baltimore Orioles, he surveyed prospects selected in the 1986 MLB Draft, many of whom attended four-year colleges, and then noticed that among California colleges, 4% of players were African American and less than 3% were Hispanic. He presented his findings to Orioles' general manager Roland Hemond and MLB Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Ueberroth contacted Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, who agreed to fund a youth baseball program in Los Angeles, providing $50,000. Young also received funding from the Amateur Athletic Union.\nYoung, with the Professional Baseball Scouts of Southern California, organized 12 teams of 180 13- and 14-year-olds in 1989, the first year of the RBI program. Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis, African American baseball players from Southern California, devoted time and money to help the program.\nMLB took over operation of the RBI program in 1991. By 1992, the RBI program expanded to Harlem, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Leonard S. Coleman, Jr., the former president of the National League, took over operation in the program in 1994, and forged a working alliance with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to help grow the RBI program.\nThe RBI program has received support from KPMG, the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, Louisville Slugger, New Balance, Rawlings, Wilson Sporting Goods, and Outdoor Cap.\nIn April 2023, MLB announced that Nike had become the presenting sponsor for RBI.\nStructure.\nTeams compete in three divisions: the Junior Boys division (13 to 15 years of age), the Senior Boys division (16 to 18 years of age), and Girls Softball (up to 18 years of age). League schedules run from May through August. Teams compete in regional tournaments in order to compete in the RBI World Series, which began in 1993. The RBI World Series is aired on the MLB Network and can be streamed on MLB.com, starting in 2010.\nAs of 2013, RBI operates over 300 programs in over 200 cities, with over 200,000 participants. Programs run in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and South America. MLB provides college scholarships to RBI participants. A Junior RBI program serves children from the ages of 6 through 12, which was launched in 2009.\nResults.\nRachel Robinson, widow of Jackie Robinson, has praised the efforts of the RBI program to reach out to African American youth. Alumni of the RBI program include major leaguers CC Sabathia, Jimmy Rollins, Coco Crisp, James Loney, Carl Crawford, B. J. Upton, Justin Upton, Julio Borbon, Efren Navarro, Ricky Romero, Yovani Gallardo, Chris Young, J. P. Crawford, Dominic Smith and James McDonald, as well as MLB draftees Trevor Reckling and Victor Roache."

        "text": "A rowing tank is an indoor facility which attempts to mimic the conditions rowers face on open water.\nRowers sit in fixed rowing positions, with a channel of water to either side of the 'boat'. Older tanks used the power of the athlete to circulate water. This experience is unrealistic, and the rowing stroke is not accurately reproduced. Modern tanks move the water past the rowers, simulating the feel of rowing a boat through open water.\nRowing tanks are primarily used for off-season rowing, muscle specific conditioning and technique training, or simply when bad weather does not allow for open water training. A tank allows basic technique to be taught to newcomers to the sport in a safe environment, and enables coaches to work on the technique of more experienced oarsmen."

        "title": "Agecroft Rowing Club",
        "text": "Agecroft Rowing Club is a rowing club based at Salford Quays, Greater Manchester, England. It was formerly based close to the Agecroft Hall in Pendleton north. Its current location is its third within today's City of Salford on a site close to the city centre of Manchester.\nHistory.\nThere has been rowing in Manchester and Salford since 1823, with more than 15 clubs operating during the 1860s. Agecroft R.C. was formed by the gradual merging of these River Irwell-based clubs. Agecroft R.C. was established in Oct 1861 by Ishmael Lythgoe with its first boat house in the grounds of Agecroft Hall at Pendlebury before the manor house was sold and rebuilt by the James River in Virginia, USA. The club soon moved to the River Irwell further upstream at Littleton Road and were based there for over a hundred years. However, in early 2000s, the stretch of river had been allowed to return more to reeds to support fishing and the boathouse lay on part of a new flood plain so the club moved to a new boathouse close to Manchester City Centre at Salford Quays. This new home triggered a huge growth in club size and successes throughout the UK.\nCurrent activities.\nThe club regularly competes across the UK at all levels and has a broad membership base, from complete novices and juniors through to semi-professional athletes competing at international level. The club regularly hosts a small boats head race in the winter and supports a British Rowing world class start coach.\nThe club hosts a wide variety of rowers of different abilities, ambitions and ages, with a large membership and a wide variety of members from juniors through students to masters. The club has achieved qualifications and wins at the British Rowing Championships, Nottingham and Henley Royal Regatta and a course record at Henley Women's Regatta in the Intermediate 4+ event.\nInternational performances.\nThe club has been successful in the World Class Start squad with wins in the World Under 23s coxless pairs and a Home Countries win for England in the single sculls by Olivia Whitlam who has since gone on to represent GB at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and the three intervening World Championships. Other internationals since 2010 include Brendan Crean (4x 2010), Graeme Thomas (World Cup win Australia 2013), Zak Lee-Green (lwt 4x u23 bronze 2010), Oli Lee (GB U23 4x 2010), Rebecca Chin (GB U23 eight Bronze, 2012) and Olivia Oakes (GB U23 eight bronze 2012). Both Brendan (England) and Graeme (Wales) have also won National Championship gold medals in 1x and Home Countries Internationals.Graeme has gone on to represent GB at 3 successive Worlds, winning silver and Bronze. He missed the Rio Olympics due to ill health, but was named as part of the GB Rowing Team for Tokyo 2021 after winning a bronze medal in the 2021 European Championships held in Varese.\nZak Lee Green is another successful Agecroft graduate and was part of the GB Lightweight team, having been to 5 World Championships winning a silver in LM4x.\nDaniele Gilardoni joined Agecroft in February 2013 where he rowed and coached.\nHenley Royal Regatta.\nAt HRR, under the coaching of Denis O'Neill, the club, in successive years lost a semi-final by one foot, then a Final, then a semifinal, after which Agecroft won for the first time The Britannia Challenge Cup in 2009. In other highest results:\nHenley Women's Regatta.\nRecent successes include the following wins\nJunior rowing.\nThe junior section of Agecroft was restarted in earnest in the 2000s with dedicated junior club officers and has over 60 members racing locally and at British Junior Rowing Championships (see below)\nMasters rowing.\nThe Masters squad was reformed in 2006/7 after the considerable success of the Agecroft Veteran squad in the 90's. From a starting point of just two members, the masters squad has circa 20 members with strong performances in the 35-50 age groups (B and C racing categories) at local, regional and national events. \nThe squad has recorded the following wins at the British Masters Rowing Championships\nAt Henley Masters Regatta there have been wins in \nwhilst they were finalists in B8+ 2019 and C4- 2021 \nNotable members.\nNotable members include:"

During the indoor portion of their season, they play on the Boyd Tinsley Courts at the nearby Boar's Head Sports Club.\nVirginia has won six recent NCAA Championships, their first in 2013 followed by three consecutive national titles in 2015–2017 and then back to back titles in 2022–2023.\nHistory.\nThe program first experienced a major renaissance when the program built new facilities and hired former coach Brian Boland as head coach in 2002. In his third season, he led the team to their first ACC regular season and tournament titles. The Cavaliers reached their first finals of the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship in 2011, falling to the USC Trojans by a score of 4–3. The program's first NCAA title came two years later, with the Cavaliers defeating UCLA in the finals.\nThe team has won the NCAA championship six times, in 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2022 and 2023. Their 2013 title was the first men's tennis title won by an ACC team. Additionally, the team has also won the ITA National Team Indoor Championship six times. The Cavaliers have won the ACC regular season title 13 times, all consecutively from 2004 to 2016. They were also the ACC Tournament champions in 11 of those years. From April 2006 to February 2016, the Virginia Cavaliers men's tennis team beat 140 consecutive ACC opponents. This winning streak is a record across all ACC sports.\nOn May 24, 2017, Andres Pedroso was named director of tennis and head coach of the team, replacing Boland who had accepted the Head of Men's Tennis position at USTA Player Development.\nOn May 22, 2022, the Cavaliers swept Kentucky to win their 5th National Championship. This 4–0 victory concluded an impressive tournament run from the Cavaliers, beating the SEC's best to offer in South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee and the aforementioned Kentucky Wildcats. One year later, UVA repeated as national champions after beating the Ohio State Buckeyes 4–0 in the NCAA Finals, winning the doubles point and sweeping the top three courts.\nHonors.\nITA National Assistant Coach of the Year.\n\"Information about honors and former players cited from the 2017 team fact book\""

In three seasons he scored 1,193 points, grabbed 852 rebounds and was named the Southern Conference Co-Player of the Year as a senior. Gregory averaged a team-leading 18.3 points per game as well as 11.5 rebounds per game that season en route to sharing the award with William &amp; Mary's Tom Jasper.\nAlthough the Pirates never won a conference championship nor participated in any postseason tournaments during his career, Gregory was part of a unique historical oddity during his junior season in 1969–70: the three starting frontcourt players all averaged double-doubles for the year. Additionally, each of them shared the same first name: Jim Gregory (forward), Jim Fairley (forward), and Jim Modlin (center). Their point-rebound averages were, respectively: 16.5/10.4, 16.7/12.1, and 18.5/10.5. It is believed that this may be the only occurrence in National Collegiate Athletic Association history in which three teammates each averaged point-rebound double-doubles during the same season.\nAfter college, the Memphis Pros of the American Basketball Association selected him in the 10th round of the 1971 ABA Draft, but Gregory never played in the league. Gregory was later inducted into the East Carolina Hall of Fame as part of their 1982 induction class. For his career, he averaged a double-double of 15.5 points and 11.1 rebounds per game (the latter is tied for first all-time in school history)."

The two teams reached the final after progressing through the Super League XVIII play-offs. It was Warrington's second successive Grand Final and second successive defeat as Wigan won 30-16 with 28 unanswered points after going 16-2 down in the first half to claim a Super League/Challenge Cup double, having won the 2013 Challenge Cup against Hull F.C. at Wembley Stadium in August.\nBackground.\nRoute to the Final.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington's 2013 play-off campaign started with a 40-20 home win over last season's Grand Final winners, Leeds Rhinos with Ben Westwood scoring four tries. The result, coupled with Wigan's win over the league leaders Huddersfield, meant that Warrington would be the team to choose in the Club Call.\nOn Sunday 22 September, Warrington opted to play Huddersfield Giants in the Qualifying Semi Final instead of a re-match against Leeds. Warrington's coach Tony Smith did not have any say in the choice of opponent, after describing the Club Call as \"a ridiculous gimmick\". Warrington's choice proved fruitful, as they ran out 30-22 winners against Huddersfield to send Warrington into their second Grand Final in two years, having never reached the final before the 2012 final.\nWigan Warriors.\nFollowing a poor run of results towards the end of the regular season, Wigan slipped down from first to fourth in the table, forfeiting home advantage in the first round of the play-offs as a result. Despite being drawn away in their Qualifying Play off game, Wigan went to Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium and won 22-8 with two tries for Josh Charnley and two drop-goals from Matty Smith.\nFollowing the Club Call decision by Warrington, Wigan met Leeds in the Qualifying Semi Final at the DW Stadium at the same stage and same venue as the 2012 play-offs. However, Wigan would be successful in 2013, winning 22-12 in what would be the last home match for Sam Tomkins, Pat Richards and Lee Mossop.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nA cagey opening to the game saw little in the way of notable action aside from 3 minutes into the game when Wigan stand off Blake Green was tackled and Warrington second rower Ben Westwood punched a prone Green in the face. The referee only put Westwood on report for the incident. After receiving treatment, Green was able to carry on. Wigan took the lead on 11 minutes when Pat Richards booted a penalty kick to put Wigan 2-0 up. Green kicked a 40/20 shortly after to give Wigan a prime opportunity to extend their lead but they couldn't take it. On 21 minutes, Warrington took the lead when winger Joel Monaghan plucked a Lee Briers kick out of the air but Stefan Ratchford couldn't nail the conversion, 4-2 to Warrington.\n3 minutes later the Wire extended their lead after the Warriors kicked out on the full from the kickoff. They gained territory from the set and Simon Grix took Micky Higham's pass to crash over the line. Ratchford converts to make it 10-2. Warrington scored again on 26 minutes as Ben Westwood charged over from close range after great work from Briers with Ratchford kicking the extras to make it 16-2 and put Warrington in the driving seat. As the game inched closer to half time, a turning point came when Joel Monaghan paid the ultimate price for halting Warriors winger Pat Richards' charge to the corner as he knocked himself out preventing Richards from going over for a try. After he was stretchered off, Wigan showed there were still signs of life when the Josh Charnley-Darrell Goulding combination that had been so great all season, but so wasteful in this game up until this point, finally clicked when Sam Tomkins sent Goulding over in the corner. Richards was unable to convert as the score at half time was 16-6.\nSecond half.\nThe next try was going to be a pivotal one whichever way it went and it went to Wigan on 49 minutes as Michael McIlorum threw a dummy at the play the ball which fooled Warrington's defence and he was able to scoot over the line with Richards' conversion reducing the deficit to 16-12. Warrington would then lose Ratchford to injury as they began to run out of bodies. Wigan tied the game on 53 minutes as Goulding played a grubber kick behind the Warrington line and Charnley was quickest to react as he won the race to the ball and went over; Richards kicking the extras to give Wigan a slender 18-16 lead. The Warriors then extended their lead with 15 minutes left as Green, sporting a black eye after the punch he took earlier in the game, sold Adrian Morley a dummy before diving under the posts to give Richards an easy conversion to put Wigan 24-16 up. With six minutes left, Richards ended a glittering 8 season career at Wigan with one more try and conversion as he plucked a looping pass from Sean O'Loughlin to touch down in the corner and convert his own try to make it 30-16. This win sealed the Super League and Challenge Cup double for Wigan, the Warriors becoming the first team to achieve that feat since St Helens in 2006 and ensured that Sam Tomkins, Pat Richards, and Lee Mossop would all leave for the NRL on a high. It was heartbreak though for Lee Briers, who retired at the end of this season, and outgoing Wolves players Adrian Morley, Gareth Carvell, and Michael Cooper.\nWorld Club Challenge.\nBy winning this match the Warriors had qualified for the World Club Challenge, to be played early in the 2014 season against the winners of the 2013 NRL Grand final, the Sydney Roosters."

In 1994 and 1995, Gilmore's final two seasons at USC Aiken, his teams had a combined record of 69–46, but both failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament.\nTwo future Major League Baseball players– Adam Riggs and Bryan Ward– played under Gilmore at USC Aiken.\nCoastal Carolina.\nGilmore became the head coach of Division I Coastal Carolina for the start of the 1996 season. After losing seasons in 1996 and 1997, the Chanticleers qualified for the postseason under Gilmore for the first time in 1998. With an 11–7 conference record, the team finished second in the Big South and qualified for the Big South Tournament. There, Coastal Carolina finished as the runner-up to Liberty. In 1999, the team won the Big South regular season championship with a 10–2 conference record. It hosted the Big South Tournament, but lost to Winthrop in the championship game. Gilmore was named the 1999 Big South Coach of the Year. In 2000, the team finished tied for fourth in the Big South and was eliminated early in the conference tournament.\nIn 2001, the team finished second and won the Big South Tournament to qualify for its first NCAA tournament during Gilmore's tenure. The team won its first two games in the double-elimination Athens Regional, but host Georgia came out of the loser's bracket to defeat the Chanticleers twice and advance to the Super Regionals.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Coastal Carolina made five consecutive appearances in the NCAA tournament; in that time span, it won four consecutive Big South Tournaments from 2001 to 2004, and Gilmore was named conference Coach of the Year in both 2002 and 2005. In the three NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2004, the team finished no higher than third in a regional. In 2005 season, the team lost to Winthrop in the Big South Tournament championship game but received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, its first such bid in Gilmore's tenure. In the Tempe Regional, the Chanticleers lost in the regional final to Arizona State.\nIn 2006, Coastal Carolina went 30–27 and finished third in the Big South. At the conference tournament, which it hosted, the team went 1–2, and it did not receive a bid to the NCAA tournament.\nFrom 2007 to 2012, Coastal Carolina won six consecutive Big South regular season and tournament titles; the program qualified for the NCAA tournament in each season. Gilmore won the Big South Coach of the Year award in five of the six seasons (2007–2010, 2012). The program won at least 40 games in each season and at least 50 in 2007, 2008, and 2010.\nThe Chanticleers hosted three NCAA regionals in the six-year span and advanced to the Super Regional round twice. In 2007, the program hosted an NCAA regional for the first time but lost to second-seeded Clemson in the regional final. The team finished with a 50–13 record, and Gilmore signed a contract through the 2015 season following the season. In 2008, the Chanticleers hosted and won the Conway Regional, scoring at least 10 runs in wins over fourth-seeded Columbia, third-seeded Alabama, and second-seeded East Carolina. In the Cary Super Regional, Coastal Carolina lost to No. 2 national seed North Carolina, two games to none. In 2010, Coastal Carolina had a 25–0 Big South record and went 4–0 at the Big South Tournament to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. It was selected as the No. 4 national seed and hosted the Myrtle Beach Regional. There, after losing its second game to College of Charleston, the team won three consecutive games to win the regional from the loser's bracket. It then hosted the best-of-three Myrtle Beach Super Regional against eventual national champion South Carolina. In it, Coastal Carolina lost both games, 4–3 and 10–9, respectively, and was eliminated from the tournament.\nIn 2013, the Big South split into two divisions. Coastal Carolina won the South Division. After being eliminated from the Big South Tournament, the team received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and went 0–2 at the Blacksburg Regional.\nUnder Gilmore, Coastal Carolina's home venue, Charles Watson Stadium, was renovated several times during the early 2000s. During the 2013 season, it was rebuilt as part of a $10.2 million project to rebuild Coastal Carolina's baseball and softball facilities.\nSix of Gilmore's players at Coastal Carolina – Mike Costanzo, Dave Sappelt, Tommy La Stella, Keith Hessler, Rico Noel and Taylor Motter – have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nOn Thursday April 17, 2014, Gilmore earned career victory #1000 as the Chanticleers defeated Presbyterian College 4–3 in 13 innings at TicketReturn.com Field in Myrtle Beach, SC.\nOn June 30, 2016, Gilmore led Coastal to the National Championship, with a 4–3 victory over Arizona. It was Coastal's first trip to the CWS in program history. Coastal becomes the 2nd school in the state of South Carolina to win the CWS, after South Carolina did it in 2010 and 2011.\nOn May 30th, 2023, Gilmore announced that the 2024 season would be his last. He has dealt with cancer in his liver and pancreas since his diagnosis in 2020.\nHead coaching records.\nBelow is a table of Gilmore's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach.\nHall of fame inductions.\nGilmore was inducted into the Salem-Roanoke Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010 and the USC Aiken Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013."

        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines women's volleyball team represents the University of Michigan in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I competition. The women's volleyball program at the University of Michigan began in 1973. Erin Virtue has been the coach since 2023. The team plays its home matches at Cliff Keen Arena.\nHistory.\nVong years (1973–1983).\nSandy Vong was the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines women's volleyball program. He held the position for 11 years from 1973 to 1983. Vong's 1981 team compiled a 40-17 record, captured the school's first Big Ten Conference volleyball championship, won the AIAW Regional Championship, and finished in eighth place at the AIAW National Championship.\nThree coaches (1984–1991).\nDuring the eight years from 1984 to 1991, the Michigan women's volleyball program had three head coaches: Barb Canning (1984–1985), Joyce Davis (1986–1989), and Peggy Bradley-Doppes (1990–1991). The team compiled a winning record in only one of those eight years, a 19-12 finish in 1991.\nGiovanazzi years (1992–1998).\nIn 1992, Peggy Bradley-Doppes stepped down as Michigan's head volleyball coach to focus on her duties as the school's women's athletic director. Greg Giovanazzi, a former All-American volleyball player at UCLA, was hired to replace her. Giovanazzi led the team for seven years from 1992 to 1998. The 1997 Michigan team reached the 20-win level for the first time since 1987 and was the subject of a profile in the \"Chicago Tribune\" indicating that the program was experiencing a renaissance. The 1997 team ultimately compiled a 21-12 record, finished in third place in the Big Ten, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in the program's history. The team lost to Texas A&amp;M in the second round of the 1997 tournament.\nInterest in the sport at Michigan declined after the 1997 season, with average home attendance dropping to less than 600 during the 1998 season. Giovanazzi was replaced as Michigan's head volleyball coach after the 1998 season.\nRosen years (1999–2022).\nMark Rosen was hired as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines women's volleyball team in 1999. He had previously been a volleyball coach at Cal State Bakersfield (1992–93), Northern Michigan University (1994–97) and Boise State University (1998) Since taking over the program, Rosen has led the Wolverines to national prominence. His teams have advanced to the NCAA Tournament in 12 of his first 14 years as head coach and have reached the 20-win level for seven consecutive years from 2006 to 2012. Between 2006 and 2012, the team has compiled an overall record of 170–67 ().\nIn 2008, Rosen broke Sandy Vong's team record for career wins at Michigan. The 2008 team compiled a 26–9 record, marking the first time the team had reached 20 wins in three consecutive seasons.\nIn 2009, Rosen's team compiled a 27–10 record, defeated No. 4-ranked Stanford in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and ultimately advanced to the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Tournament.\nIn 2011, Michigan again defeated Stanford in the NCAA Tournament, reaching the Round of 16. In 2012, the team compiled a 27–12 record and advanced to the National Semifinal round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history.\nIn June 2013, the Michigan women's volleyball team toured Argentina and Brazil and played 10 matches against local teams. The Wolverines compiled a 9–1 record on their South American tour. The final three matches were against the Brazilian Youth National Team, and Michigan won two of the three matches.\nAfter the 2022 season, Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced that Rosen would not return for the 2023 season, after 24 seasons as the head coach.\nVirtue years (2023–present).\nOn January 17, 2023, Erin Virtue was hired as the head coach to replace Rosen. Prior to Michigan, Virtue was the offensive coordinator for the United States women's national volleyball team, and the director of the USA National Team Development Program. Virtue had also previously served as an assistant coach at Michigan from 2011 to 2015 as well as Northwestern (2016–18), Cincinnati (2007–10), and Loyola Chicago (2006).\nFacilities.\nSince 1989, the team has played its home matches at Cliff Keen Arena located on Hoover Street in the school's athletic campus between the Administration Building and the Intramural Building. The facility has a seating capacity of 1,800 and is also used by Michigan's men's gymnatics and wrestling teams. It was built in 1956 for the Michigan swimming and diving team and was known as the Matt Mann Pool from 1956 to 1988 and as Varsity Arena from 1988 to 1989.\nCoaching records.\nThe Michigan women's volleyball team has had six head coaches since it was established in 1973. Their coaching records are as follows:\nNotable players.\nAVCA All-Americans.\nIn 2003, Erin Moore became the first Michigan volleyball player to be selected as an All-American by the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA). In 2009, Lexi Zimmerman became Michigan's first player to receive first-team All-America honors. In total, 16 Michigan women's volleyball players have received All-American recognition from the AVCA 24 times.\nBig Ten Medal of Honor.\nThree Michigan women's volleyball players have won the Big Ten Medal of Honor.\nAll-Big Ten.\nNineteen Michigan women's volleyball players have received All-Big Ten Conference recognition.\nIndividual records.\nMichigan team records are based on the Michigan Volleyball Record Book."

        "text": "John Albert (born January 19, 1989) is an American professional ice hockey forward who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played as captain for the Toledo Walleye in the ECHL. He was selected by the Atlanta Thrashers in the 6th round (175th overall) of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft and has formerly played with the Winnipeg Jets. Albert was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but grew up in Concord Township, Ohio.\nPlaying career.\nPrior to turning professional, Albert played NCAA college hockey with Ohio State University.\nOn July 20, 2011, Albert signed with the St. John's IceCaps of the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 2011–12 AHL season. On December 2, 2013, one day after being recalled by the Winnipeg Jets, Albert scored his first NHL goal on his first shot on goal in the league, beating goalie Cam Talbot of the New York Rangers in Winnipeg's 5–2 victory at Madison Square Gardens.\nOn June 29, 2015, the Jets gave Albert a qualifying offer in order to retain his negotiation rights. Albert later signed an AHL contract with the Jets' new affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, on September 16, 2015. After attending the Jets training camp on a try-out, he joined the Manitoba Moose and was named team captain.\nOn July 3, 2016, Albert ended his long tenure within the Thrashers/Jets organization, joining Oulun Kärpät of the Finnish Liiga. In the 2016–17 season, Albert made a seamless transition to European hockey and contributed with 12 goals and 24 points in 42 games for Kärpät.\nOn July 3, 2017, after a year's absence, Albert returned to the NHL in securing a one-year, two-way contract with the Washington Capitals. During the 2017–18 season, on February 9, 2018, the Capitals traded Albert to the New York Rangers organization. He was directly assigned to the Rangers AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, for the remainder of the season.\nAs a free agent from the Rangers, Albert returned to Europe in agreeing to a one-year deal with German club, Grizzlys Wolfsburg, of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga on July 3, 2018. During preparation with the Grizzlys for the 2018–19 campaign, Albert suffered a long-term injury, forcing him out for the entirety of the season.\nReturning to North America, Albert resumed his professional career in the 2019–20 season after signing a contract with the Jacksonville Icemen of the ECHL, a secondary affiliate to the Winnipeg Jets, on October 3, 2019. In the 2019–20 season, Albert collected 29 points through 44 regular season games before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a free agent into the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, Albert belatedly joined the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL on January 22, 2021. He split the season between the Thunder and the Rapid City Rush, finishing with a combined 11 points in 30 games.\nAlbert continued his career in the ECHL, agreeing to return for a fourth season in the league in joining the Toledo Walleye as a free agent on September 29, 2021.\nIn November, 2022, John Albert was named the captain of the Toledo Walleye.

        "text": "The 2014 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2013–14 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs, played from June 5 to 15, 2014. It was contested between two-time defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat and the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs. In a rematch, the Spurs defeated the Heat 4–1 for their 5th title overall. Kawhi Leonard was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP), receiving 10 out of 11 votes.\nThe series served as a rematch from the previous NBA season, the 12th in Finals history, but only the fifth since the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. This was the first NBA Finals since 1984 to use the 2–2–1–1–1 format after the Board of Governors agreed to change the format from 2–3–2, which was used from 1985 to 2013.\nIn , the Spurs were joined by the Denver Nuggets as the only former ABA franchises to win an NBA championship. The 2023 Finals series also involved the Heat on the losing side in five games.\nBackground.\nMiami Heat.\nLed by their Big Three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, the Miami Heat made their fourth straight appearance in the NBA Finals, following two back-to-back wins in the 2012 and 2013 playoffs.\nThey were the first team since the 1987 Boston Celtics to make it to four straight NBA Finals, and only the fourth team in NBA history to achieve that goal, besides the 1966 Boston Celtics (as a matter of fact, ten straight appearances), 1985 Los Angeles Lakers and the 1986-87 Boston Celtics. From 2015 to 2018 the Cleveland Cavaliers led by LeBron James also achieved the same feat. They were seeking to become the first NBA team to three-peat since the 2002 Los Angeles Lakers. Heading into the postseason, the Heat had an 11–14 record in the last 25 games. In the first round, they eliminated the Charlotte Bobcats and won 4–0. In the Conference Semifinals, they eliminated the Brooklyn Nets and won 4–1, despite being swept by Brooklyn in the regular season. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they again played the Indiana Pacers in a rematch of the previous year's Conference Finals. Miami won the series 4–2, eliminating the Indiana Pacers from the playoffs for the third straight year.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe Spurs had a deep roster, with no player averaging 30 minutes during the regular season. Their offense relied on ball movement, being called \"one of the most beautiful-to-watch teams in the NBA\" by \"USA Today\".\nThis was the San Antonio Spurs's sixth appearance in the NBA Finals, and they headed to the postseason with the best record in the NBA and a franchise record 19-game winning streak, ending with a 22–4 run in their last 26 games. In the first round, they faced their Texas rivals, the Dallas Mavericks, who surprised the Spurs by taking the series to seven games despite the Spurs sweeping the Mavericks in the regular season for 2 consecutive years. San Antonio won 4–3. In the Conference Semifinals, they eliminated the Portland Trail Blazers and won 4–1. In their third consecutive Conference Finals, they eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder and won the series 4–2, despite being swept by Oklahoma City in the regular season, and for the first time, they qualified for back-to-back Finals appearances.\nRegular season series.\nThe regular season series was split 1–1, with each team winning at home:\nGame summaries.\nThe Spurs rebounded from their seven-game loss to the Heat in the 2013 Finals to win the series, 4–1, for the franchise's fifth NBA championship. After winning their first four over nine seasons, this was their first since 2007. They defeated Miami by margins of at least 15 points in each of their four wins and also outscored them by an average of 14.0 points per game in the series, which was the largest differential in Finals history at the time. The Spurs finished the playoffs with 12 wins by 15 points or more, the most ever in the postseason. Miami had won 11 straight playoffs series, which was the fifth longest in league history.\nThe Spurs' Kawhi Leonard was named the Finals MVP after leading the team in scoring in each of the final three games, averaging 23.7 points and shooting 68.5 percent, after scoring just nine in each of the first two games Overall, he averaged 17.8 points on 61.2 percent shooting in the series, the highest field goal percentage of any Finals MVP, and shot 65 percent when guarded by LeBron James in the series. Leonard also led the team with a 57.9 three-point field goal percentage. Leonard was the third-youngest recipient of the award (22 years and 351 days old) since its inception in 1969, and the youngest since Magic Johnson in 1982.\nTim Duncan of the Spurs led all players in the series with 50 rebounds. He was followed by teammate Boris Diaw (43), who was inserted into the starting lineup beginning in Game 3. Diaw led all players in the series in assists (29).\nGame 1.\nTim Duncan scored 21 points and had 10 rebounds to lead the Spurs to a 110–95 win in Game 1. The game featured the AT&amp;T Center's malfunctioning air-conditioning system, which caused temperatures in the arena to exceed in the second half. The conditions caused Miami's LeBron James to dehydrate and experience cramps, limiting him to just five minutes of playing time in the fourth quarter. With James on the bench, San Antonio went on a 16–3 run in the game's final four minutes, and outscored the Heat 36–17 in the fourth quarter.\nJames, who also had cramps in the finals two years earlier, finished the game with 25 points while playing only 33 minutes. Manu Ginóbili had 16 points and 11 assists and Tony Parker contributed 19 points and eight assists for the Spurs, who shot 59 percent for the game despite committing 23 turnovers.\nThe Spurs shot 14/16 in the 4th quarter. The Spurs' 87.5% conversion rating in the 4th quarter was the most efficient field goal conversion rating for any team in any quarter in NBA Finals history.\nGame 2.\nJames rebounded from cramps in Game 1 with 35 points and 10 rebounds to lead Miami to a 98–96 win to tie the series. Bosh made the go-ahead three-point field goal on a pass from James with 1:18 remaining in the game, as the Heat won their 13th straight following a postseason loss. Temperatures in the AT&amp;T Center were comfortable for the game after a broken circuit breaker was repaired following Game 1.\nAfter enduring criticism for not finishing the previous game, James started slowly in the first quarter, shooting 1-for-4 with three turnovers. Meanwhile, the Spurs began the game making 10 of their first 15 shots. James then made 11 of his next 13, and finished 14-for-22 while played a game-high 37 minutes. He had 11 points in the second quarter, when the Heat overcome an early 11-point deficit. The score remained close through the remainder of the game. The Spurs held a two-point lead with 6:43 remaining in the fourth quarter, when Miami's Mario Chalmers elbowed Parker in the midsection for a flagrant foul. Tony Parker and Tim Duncan then combined to miss four straight free throws. James scored 33 in the final three quarters; he had 22 in the second half, when every shot he made was from or further. He also made a key strip of Parker late in the game.\nBosh finished with 18 points, and Wade and Rashard Lewis added 14 for Miami. Parker had 21 points and Duncan scored 18 points with 15 rebounds for the Spurs, who had won eight consecutive home games by at least 15 points. Parker passed Michael Jordan for eighth place on the NBA's all-time playoff assist list.\nGame 3.\nThe Spurs took a 2–1 lead in the series after a career-high 29 points from Leonard and a Finals-record 75.8% shooting effort from the team during the first half. Leonard, limited to only 18 points in the first two games, made his first six shots and was 10-of-13 for the game. San Antonio led by as many as 25 and were comfortably ahead most of the game, including 71–50 at the half. The 21-point margin was the largest halftime lead in the Finals by a road team since Game 3 in 1996 by the Chicago Bulls against the Seattle SuperSonics. The Heat scored 10-straight points in the third quarter to bring the score to 81–74, the closest they would get to the Spurs the rest of the game.\nSan Antonio's insertion of Boris Diaw into the starting lineup created more ball movement, as the Spurs achieved the first 70-point first half in the Finals since the Los Angeles Lakers' 75 from Game 2 in 1987 against the Boston Celtics. The Heat, who had been 8–0 at home in the playoffs, were led by James and Wade with 22 points apiece. Miami's 20 turnovers were their playoff-high, with James committing his Finals career-high of 7.\nGame 4.\nLeonard had 20 points and 14 rebounds in another rout of the Heat, as the Spurs won 107–86 to take a 3–1 lead in the series; no team had ever come back from a 3–1 deficit in the Finals until two years later. San Antonio again built a large lead on the road before halftime, taking a 55–33 lead in the second quarter after scoring seven consecutive points, culminated by a soaring dunk by Leonard. The Spurs defense held Miami to just 35 percent shooting in the first half after allowing the Heat to shoot 50 percent overall in the prior game. The Heat had followed their prior 13 playoff losses with a win.\nThe Heat struggled to defend the Spurs' crisp ball movement, orchestrated by Diaw and his game-high nine assists. San Antonio made 57 percent of its field goals, with Parker scoring 19 points, and Duncan adding 10 points and 11 rebounds to surpass Magic Johnson for the most double-doubles in NBA Playoffs history (158). Duncan also eclipsed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's previous mark (8,851) for most postseason minutes played. Miami was led by James, who had 28 points and eight rebounds, but their other starters combined for only 28 points on 32 percent shooting. Wade made only 1 of 10 from the field through three quarters, finishing with 10 points.\nGame 5.\nThe Spurs won 104–87 to win the championship in five games and avenge last season's loss to the Heat in seven games. Leonard had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, and was named the Finals MVP. James had 17 first-quarter points for the Heat, who got off to a fast start in building an early 22–6 lead. San Antonio bounced back to outscore Miami 37–13 from the beginning of the second quarter through the middle of the third.\nGinóbili had 19 points and four assists, and Patty Mills scored 17 points off the bench for the Spurs. James finished with 31 points and 10 rebounds, while Bosh had 13 points and Wade added 13 but shot only 4-for-12 from the field.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC with Mike Breen (play-by-play) and Jeff Van Gundy (analyst) as commentators. Also beginning this Finals, and for the first time since 2011, Mark Jackson returned as analyst after being fired by the Golden State Warriors early in the season. ESPN Radio aired it as well and had Kevin Calabro and Hubie Brown as commentators.\nAftermath.\nSpurs.\nTo date, this is the Spurs' most recent NBA Finals appearance. The team made the playoffs over the next five years, the first two of which involved Tim Duncan. The Spurs won a franchise record 67 games in the 2015–16 season, including a record-tying 40 home victories (shared with the 1985–86 Boston Celtics). However, they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Duncan retired shortly after. The following season, the Spurs won 62 games and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the Golden State Warriors in four games. The remaining core of Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili made one more playoff appearance in 2017–18, but lost in five games to the Warriors in the first round. Ginóbili retired after the season, and Parker followed suit after playing one season with the Charlotte Hornets. Meanwhile, Leonard was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan. The Spurs' run of 50-win seasons ended in the 2018–19 season, when they won only 48 games and lost in the first round to the Denver Nuggets. It was also the Spurs' most recent playoff appearance as the team gradually declined, culminating in a 22–win season in 2022–23, their worst 82-game season record under Gregg Popovich and worst overall since the 1996–97 season.\nHeat.\nAfter the season, LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers, leading them to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances and the NBA championship. Meanwhile, Miami underwent a transition phase. Chris Bosh played his last game in the 2015–16 season, retiring in 2019 due to health issues, and Dwyane Wade briefly left the Heat to join the Chicago Bulls. Wade then reunited with James on the Cavaliers, but was traded back to the Heat midway through the 2017–18 season. After the 2018–19 season, Wade announced his retirement. During this period, the Heat made two playoff appearances and won one series, a first round victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The Heat made two subsequent NBA Finals appearances in and , losing both times. Udonis Haslem, who was on the roster in all of Miami's Finals appearances, retired after the 2022–23 season."

Tony Kanaan entered the race as the defending champion. Ed Carpenter won the pole position, his second consecutive pole at Indy. The race was won by Ryan Hunter-Reay, the first American-born winner since Sam Hornish Jr. in 2006. Hunter-Reay held off second place Hélio Castroneves by a margin of 0.0600 seconds, the second-closest finish in race history. At an average speed of , it was also the second-fastest 500 in history. Marco Andretti, Carlos Muñoz, and Juan Pablo Montoya rounded out the top five. Kurt Busch, in sixth position, claimed Rookie of the Year honors.\nThe month of May activities opened with the inaugural Grand Prix of Indianapolis, which was won by Simon Pagenaud on May 10. Practice opened for the Indy 500 on Sunday, May 11. Time trials were held over two days, May 17–18, and a post-qualifying practice was held on May 19. The traditional final day of practice, dubbed Carb Day, was held on Friday, May 23.\nAll four divisions of the Road to Indy ladder participated in the month of May activities. The Cooper Tires Indy Lights held the Liberty Challenge and Freedom 100. The Pro Mazda Series and U.S. F2000 held races on the Speedway's road course, then held oval races at nearby Lucas Oil Raceway. The Stadium Super Trucks series also held an event on Carb Day.\nEvent background.\nIn September 2013 an IndyCar feasibility test was conducted on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway combined road course, in preparations for a possible road course race. In October 2013, the inaugural Grand Prix of Indianapolis was scheduled for Saturday, May 10, 2014.\nJim Nabors performed \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" before the 2014 race, marking his 35th and final time doing so. On March 25 the 83-year-old Nabors announced that he would retire from performing at the 500 because his health limits his travel from his Hawaii home.\nSchedule.\nTrack activity commenced on Tuesday April 29 with a refresher test for Jacques Villeneuve and Kurt Busch on the oval.

He was joined by 2000 winner Juan Pablo Montoya, who returned to the Indy 500 for the first time since his victory, after spending time in Formula One and NASCAR.\nJacques Villeneuve announced he would return to the 500 with Sam Schmidt Motorsports. It was his first appearance since his victory in 1995 (this would mean Montoya, Villeneuve and Tony Kanaan would all be attempting to win the race twice consecutively). 1996 winner Buddy Lazier also returned to the 500 with Lazier Partners Racing. Lazier drove for this team in 2013, as well.\nThree-time Indy 500 winner, and four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti announced his retirement from racing in the fall of 2013, following a crash at Houston. In late March, Franchitti was named as the driver of the pace car.\nFormer NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Kurt Busch, who took a rookie test in 2013, announced he would enter the 500 with Andretti Autosport. He would attempt the Indy/Charlotte \"Double Duty\", the first driver to do so since Robby Gordon in 2004.

Previously, unapproved engine changes penalties incurred during the month of May at Indianapolis would be served at the next race of the season (Detroit). Starting in 2014, the penalty will be points deductions to the manufacturers championship. If teams act in deliberate negligence to cause engine failures, the penalty will be starting from the rear of the field.\nStarting in 2014, IndyCar championship points for the Indianapolis 500, as well as the Pocono 500 and MAVTV 500 (Fontana) will be doubled compared to the other races on the schedule.\nTesting and Rookie orientation.\nRefresher tests – Tuesday April 29.\nThe first track activity for 2014 was a refresher test involving two drivers, race rookie Kurt Busch and former winner Jacques Villeneuve. Both drivers passed their refresher test without incident. The 25-lap formal refresher test consists of the second and third phases of the official rookie test. Busch, who initially passed a rookie test in 2013, returned to the Speedway in preparations for attempting Double Duty.

Viso drove in substitution for James Hinchcliffe at Andretti Autosport. A day earlier during the Grand Prix of Indianapolis, Hinchcliffe suffered a concussion after debris struck him in the helmet. He was sidelined until cleared to drive by physicians.\nMonday May 12 – Practice.\nRyan Hunter-Reay became the first driver to break the 225 mph barrier during practice. During \"Happy Hour\", the final hour of practice for the day, he drove a lap of . A total of 30 drivers completed 2,286 laps without major incident.

Both E. J. Viso and Pippa Mann suffered mechanical/engine issues. The most serious issue of the day belonged to Mikhail Aleshin, who stopped on the course with an engine fire.\nFriday May 16 – Fast Friday Practice.\nRain kept the cars off the track most of the day, and allowed only a 19-minute practice session on Fast Friday. Ed Carpenter set the fastest lap of the month during the brief session, with a lap of . It was the first 230 mph lap at the Speedway since 2003. All cars were permitted 140 kPa of turbocharger \"boost\" during practice on Friday, up from 130 kPa allowed Sunday through Thursday. No incidents were reported.

Chip Ganassi Racing with driver Scott Dixon defeated Dreyer &amp; Reinbold-Kingdom Racing (Sage Karam) in the final round to win the annual tournament.\nRace summary.\nStart.\nRace morning dawned with blue skies, and no chance of rain. Mari Hulman George and Jim Nabors gave the command to start engines together, and pace car driver Dario Franchitti led the field on the parade and pace laps. A clean start saw James Hinchcliffe grab the lead into turn one. Exiting turn two, Ryan Briscoe nearly spun and crashed, but kept the car under control without incident.\nHinchcliffe led the first nine laps, then polesitter Ed Carpenter took the lead on lap 10. Unlike the previous year, lead changes were at a minimum in the opening laps.\nFirst half.\nThe race went caution free for the first 149 laps. It marked the longest stretch of consecutive laps without a caution since before records were kept beginning in 1976. It also set a record for most consecutive laps from the start of the race before the first yellow. The modern era record was 66 laps in 2000, while the 1954 race reportedly went 110 laps before the first yellow caution period.\nThe field shuffled through several green-flag pit stops, while only two cars dropped out in the first half. Graham Rahal retired after 44 laps, suffering from electrical issues which kept shutting off the engine. Buddy Lazier was sidelined with clutch issues, but not before he moved into 7th place all-time in laps/miles completed at Indy.\nOn lap 66, Tony Kanaan's chances of winning were dashed. He ran out of fuel, but made it back to the pits. He returned to the track after a lengthy 43-second pit stop, but was back in the pits seven laps later with a broken starter. Kanaan fell 18 laps down as the crew made repairs.\nAt the halfway point, leader Ryan Hunter-Reay set a new record with an average speed of 211.871 mph.\nSecond half.\nA spin-out and crash involving Charlie Kimball on lap 149 brought out the first yellow flag. The leaders pitted, and the green came back out on lap 158. Ten laps later, Scott Dixon crashed in turn four, bringing out the second caution of the day. Dixon's crash snapped a streak of 1,733 consecutive laps completed at Indy, dating back to the start of the 2006 race.\nThe green came out for a restart with 25 laps to go. Ryan Hunter-Reay led Ed Carpenter, Townsend Bell, James Hinchcliffe, and Hélio Castroneves. As the field jockeyed down the main stretch, Hunter-Reay led into turn one. Directly behind him, Carpenter and Bell went side-by-side going into turn one. At that moment, Hinchcliffe dove to the inside, making it three-abreast into turn one. Hinchcliffe touched with Carpenter, sending both cars spinning and crashing into the outside wall. Bell, Castroneves, and the rest of the field slipped by unscathed. After the race, Carpenter angrily said \"if he didn't have a concussion last week I would have punched him in the face.\"\nRed flag.\nThe green came out on lap 180, with Ryan Hunter-Reay leading. The lead shuffled quickly between Marco Andretti, Hélio Castroneves, and then back to Hunter-Reay. Then on lap 191, Townsend Bell crashed hard into the outside wall at the exit of turn two, damaging the SAFER barrier. With less than nine laps remaining, officials elected to put out the red flag and halted the race to allow workers to clean up the incident, repair the barrier, and allow the opportunity for a green flag finish. Considerable debris, along with damage to the SAFER Barrier and catchfence, required a red flag of nearly 11 minutes.\nThe red flag drew some mild controversy, but it was generally praised by most fans and competitors in the effort to prevent the race from finishing under caution. Eight of the previous twelve Indy 500s had finished under caution due to a late-race crash or rain.\nFinish.\nThe cars re-fired and took two yellow warm-up laps. The green came with six laps to go. Ryan Hunter-Reay led the field into turn one, Hélio Castroneves tucked into second, with Marco Andretti close behind in third. The leaders started taking an extremely low line down the front and back straights, forcing their competitors to make passes to the outside.\nWith five laps to go, Castroneves made a slingshot pass on the inside, and took the lead into turn one. Andretti challenged Hunter-Reay going into turn three, but was unable to make the pass. On the next time by the start/finish line, Castroneves was able to maintain the lead going into turn one. The top three cars stayed nose-to-tail going down the backstretch, at which time Hunter-Reay made a daring dive pass below the white line to take the lead going into turn three. The field crossed the start/finish line for three laps to go with Hunter-Reay leading.\nWith two laps to go, Castroneves went to the outside to pass Hunter-Reay going into turn one to retake the lead. The two raced nose-to-tail, with Andretti fading in third. As the field came down the main stretch to receive the white flag, Hunter-Reay made a slingshot pass to the outside to again retake the lead. He pulled out to a lead down the backstretch, and Castroneves was unable to challenge going into turn 3. As they came off of turn four, Castroneves tried to close the gap, and drafted going down the main stretch. He made a move to the outside, but Hunter-Reay was able to hold off the challenge, and won the race by 0.0600 seconds. It was the second-closest finish in race history behind only 1992.\n\"This race was ridiculously close and competitive,\" Hunter-Reay said after the race. \"Just glad I picked the right time to go.\" Andretti placed third, while Carlos Muñoz finished fourth. Juan Pablo Montoya placed fifth in his first Indy 500 since he won it in 2000. Kurt Busch completed the race in sixth place then flew to North Carolina for the Coca-Cola 600. His attempt to become the second driver to complete 1,100 miles in one day came up short when his engine blew later on at the Coca-Cola 600 just before the race's halfway point.\nThe win made Hunter-Reay the first American to win the Indianapolis 500 in eight years. Between Hunter-Reay, Andretti, and Muñoz, Andretti Autosport had three cars in the top four, and four of the top six with Kurt Busch as well.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, ABC broadcast both feature races in the IndyCar Series during the Indianapolis 500 meeting. This marks the fiftieth consecutive year that ABC has broadcast the 500. ABC also carried time trials for the first time since 2008. Long-time NASCAR play-by-play announcer Allen Bestwick, who has worked the Brickyard 400 since 2001, made his Indy 500 debut for 2014. Previous anchor Marty Reid had retired from the network on September 29, 2013 following an error during the broadcast of the NASCAR Nationwide Series Kentucky 300 (a race that was worked by IMS Radio on the radio side). During pole qualifying on Sunday May 18, Dario Franchitti joined the ABC booth as guest analyst. Carb Day coverage was carried by NBC Sports Network, with Bob Varsha serving as announcer.\nInternational broadcasters included Foxtel Speed in Australia, Bandeirantes in Brazil, Motors TV in France, Sport1US in Germany, GAORA Sports in Japan, ESPN in Latin America and BT Sport 2 in the United Kingdom.\nRadio.\nPaul Page, who served as the radio announcer for the 500 from 1977 to 1987, and later the television announcer (1988–1998, 2002–2004) returned to the radio booth. He anchored the radio broadcast, replacing Mike King, who resigned after 2013. Veteran Indy driver Robbie Buhl joined Page for the broadcast as race analyst, substituting for normal IMS Radio analyst Pippa Mann, who was participating in the race. This was Buhl's only year on the broadcast, but he had covered IndyCar races (including Indy 500 time trials) on Versus for multiple seasons. After several years covering the pit area, Kevin Lee took the turn four position. Lee was substituting for Chris Denari, who missed the race due to commitments with the Pacers and Fever. Nick Yeoman reported from victory lane.\nPage ushered in some changes to the broadcast upon his return. He re-instated the turn one reporting location, with Jerry Baker manning the position. Page also brought back his \"Delta Force Intros\", made popular from his days on television. During commercial breaks, the famous out-cue was recited by Page himself. In the previous few years, driver-recorded and historical out-cues were used.\nFor the 2014 race, the network reached an audience of 11 million listeners, and was carried on 400 terrestrial radio affiliates.\n1070 The Fan broadcast nightly beginning April 29 with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\". However, several episodes of each were pre-empted due to Pacers playoff coverage. About two months after the race, veteran broadcaster, and former IMS Radio Network announcer Gary Lee died. Lee had been part of the broadcast from 1990 to 1998."

        "title": "Tennis in Scotland",
        "text": "Tennis in Scotland was introduced from France in the Middle Ages. During the 20th century it was a minor sport, but has obtained some prominence due to the successes of Andy Murray and other Scots. While tennis courts are not uncommon, the country's oceanic climate has made it historically quite hard for Scottish players to develop. The only tennis inductee into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame is Winnie Shaw. However, since 2008, Tennis Scotland's membership has increased from 32,715 to 47,657 - a rise of more than 45 per cent.\nUnlike badminton, squash and table tennis, Scotland competes as part of Great Britain in tennis; however, its contribution to the pool of British players traditionally has been very poor in the modern era with almost all notable players being English. However, this has taken an abrupt turn in recent years with emergence of Andy Murray, and doubles players Colin Fleming and Jamie Murray. Andy Murray is by some distance the best player currently representing Britain as the UK number 1 and is also the world number 1. On 7 July 2013 he became the first British player to win the men's singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, 77 years before. Brother Jamie and won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title along with Serbian Jelena Janković in 2007, the first time any British player had won a major title at Wimbledon in 20 years. Colin Fleming along with his English partner Ross Hutchins is currently ranked 9th in the ATP Doubles Team Rankings. There are no official ATP/WTA tournaments in Scotland however, with all major events in the UK being held in England.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is Tennis Scotland founded as the Scottish Lawn Tennis Association in 1895, which is based in Airthrey Castle, Stirling. It has frequently seen itself as a subset of British tennis, rather than a national body in its own right.\nHistory.\nMedieval history.\nTennis in its earlier forms was introduced into Scotland from France in the Middle Ages. It was traditionally known as \"caitch\" or \"cache\" in Scotland, and is an ancestor of the better known form of tennis. James IV of Scotland played tennis with the Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala at Stirling Castle on 10 April 1498. The Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club is claimed to be the oldest tennis court in the world.\n19th century.\nIn the nineteenth century, tennis was a fairly exclusive sport, with high level participation being mainly by the upper classes.\nScotland produced two Wimbledon men's champions in this period, Herbert Lawford and Harold Mahony. However, to complicate matters, Lawford was born in England but died in Scotland, and Mahony was Scottish born, but died in County Kerry, where his family were from.\nHerbert Lawford (15 May 1851 – 20 April 1925) was once co-World No. 1 tennis player and won the Men's Singles championship at Wimbledon in 1887, and was runner-up five times.\nHarold Mahony is best known for winning the Wimbledon Championships in 1896. He was born at 21 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh to Richard John Mahony, an Irish barrister and prominent landowner. The family had a home in Scotland but spent most of their time at Dromore Castle, in County Kerry, Ireland. Harold trained on a specially built tennis court at Dromore. Mahony was also a successful Olympian. At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris (France) he won a silver medal in the men's singles event and a bronze medal in the doubles tournament (for Great Britain and Ireland). Mahoney won the Kent Championships in 1899, defeating Wilberforce Eaves in the final, and in 1904, defeating Brame Hillyard in the final.\nThe Scottish sporting all-rounder Leslie Balfour-Melville also played tennis, but this is not as significant as his golf, cricket and rugby credentials.\nPatrick Bowes-Lyon, a relative of the Queen Mother was Scottish tennis champion in 1885, 1886 and 1888, he won the doubles at Wimbledon alongside Herbert Wilberforce.\n20th century.\nIn the 20th century, particularly the latter half, tennis became less socially stratified. However, even in the 1970s, the quality of Scottish tennis was seen as low, even featuring in a Monty Python sketch as being \"well known as the worst tennis-playing nation on Earth\". In this sketch, extraterrestrials turn people into Scotsmen in order to win Wimbledon:\nIan Collins (1903 – 1975) In 1927 he made his Wimbledon debut, the first of 12 Wimbledon Championships that he entered. He missed the Championship in 1933 after injuring himself riding, but appeared in the event every other time until 1939. His Davis Cup partnership with Colin Gregory proved successful as they were undefeated in their six matches together, in 1929 and 1930. They also combined in major tournaments and made the finals of both the Australian Championship and Wimbledon in 1929. Collins and Gregory lost to Jack Crawford and Harry Hopman in the Australian final 6–1, 6–8, 4–6, 6–1, 6–3, but beat them in the 1930 Davis Cup. They narrowly lost the Wimbledon final in another five setter, to Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn, 6–4, 5–7, 6–3, 10–12, 6–4. Collins was also a mixed doubles finalist in the 1929 Wimbledon Championship and again in 1931. As a singles player, Collins had his best showing in 1930 when he reached the fourth round, before being eliminated by Bunny Austin. The following year he had the best win of his career when he defeated number one seed Henri Cochet in the second round of the 1931 Wimbledon Championship, 6–2, 8–6, 0–6, 6–3.\nWinnie Shaw (1947–1992) was the French Open finalist in both Mixed Doubles and Women's Doubles; Australian Open semi-finalist in Singles; Wimbledon semi-finalist in Women's Doubles, and quarter-finalist in Singles.\nGeorge Kelly took up tennis after his retirement from association football. Kelly started playing Tennis with Johnny King and the pair almost made the 1970 Wimbledon Championships. Robin Welsh (1869 –1934) is another example of a Scottish tennis player better known for another sport, in this case curling.\nWith partner John Paish, John Clifton was a doubles runner-up at Newport, Wales in 1971. Clifton also made the second round of the singles at the 1971 Wimbledon Championships and the third round of the men's doubles at the 1973 Wimbledon Championships (with Stanley Matthews).\n21st century.\nBy the 21st century, Scottish tennis was greatly advanced, thanks partly to the efforts of Judy Murray in training up her sons Andy and Jamie Murray to international standard. However, it is notable that neither of the Murray brothers came up through the Scottish tennis system, nor indeed the British tennis system, and trained abroad in Spain and the USA.\nUkrainian-born Elena Baltacha, moved to Scotland as a small child, and is a four-time winner of the Aegon Award, she was also a long-term British number 1, a position she held intermittently from 2002 to 2012. However, due to her absence from competition, due to knee surgery, as of 17 June 2013 she holds a current world ranking of number 185 and domestic ranking of British number 4. Her career high ranking of world number 49 was achieved on 13 September 2010.\nIn September 2016 the 2016 Davis Cup World Group semifinal was held at the Commonwealth Arena in Glasgow, the Great Britain Davis Cup team losing 2–3 to Argentina.\nEra of success (2010's).\nSingles success.\nAs of 2022, Andy has won three Grand Slam singles titles (Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016 and US Open in 2012) and is the only player to win two Olympic Gold medals (2012 and 2016).\nAfter he beat Novak Djokovic to win his first ATP World Tour Finals title in 2012, Andy displaced Djokovic to become number one in the ATP world rankings.\nDoubles success.\nHis brother Jamie has won seven Grand Slam titles (two men's doubles and five mixed doubles). His honours list includes the 2016 Australian and 2016 US Open doubles titles and the 2007 and 2017 Wimbledon and 2017, 2018 and 2019 US Open mixed doubles titles.\nDavis Cup success.\nGreat Britain won the Davis Cup in 2015, the nations first success in 79 years since the 1936 tournament.\nDuring the competition, Andy won 11 of his 12 rubbers, which included three doubles wins with Jamie).\nWheelchair tennis.\nGordon Reid has been hugely successful as a wheelchair tennis player. In 2016, Reid win the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and Paralympic Games singles titles. In addition, he has won 19 Grand Slams in men's wheelchair doubles and three other Paralympic medals.\nClubs.\nThere are currently 251 tennis clubs in Scotland.\nList of tennis clubs in Scotland by region:\nCurrent Tournaments.\nThe Tennis Scotland (TS Open Tour 2022) leaderboard was introduced in 2018, allowing players to accumulate ranking points and climb the tables whilst competing at events on the circuit throughout the year. In addition to the frontrunners being crowned leaderboard champions, individuals occupying the top 12 spots on the men's and women's rankings also earn the chance to compete at the TS Open Tour Masters event in December.\nFormer tennis tournaments.\nNotes: This is a list of former tennis tournaments held in Scotland\n\"Source:Tennis Archives\""

To this day, ice hockey is often referred to as \"shinny\" and \"hurtling\" in Canada, suggesting a tie up with shinty and Ireland's hurling. Shinty is the national stick game of Scotland, and Phil Dracket who favours an English origin for the game, in the Fens of Cambridgeshire admits:\nIn fact, Charles Goodman Tebbutt, who wrote down the first English bandy rules, claimed the words were interchangeable:\nHowever, the similarities between the two sports, post-codification are still notable:"

        "text": "The 2013–14 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team represented the University of Louisville during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Louisville's 100th season of intercollegiate competition. The Cardinals competed in the American Athletic Conference and were coached by Rick Pitino in his 13th season. The team played its home games on Denny Crum Court at the KFC Yum! Center.\nThey finished 31–6, 15–3 in AAC play to win the regular season conference championship, sharing the title with Cincinnati. They were also champions of the AAC tournament to earn the conferences automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. In their 40th NCAA tournament appearance, the defending national champions defeated Manhattan and Saint Louis to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to rival Kentucky.\nThis was their only season in the American Athletic Conference as they moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference on July 1, 2014.\nPre-season.\nThe Cardinals were the #3 team in the USA Today Coaches preseason poll and picked to win American conference by the media and the coaches. The Cardinals returned 7 of 9 players from a team that won the 2013 NCAA Championship and both Big East regular season and tournament championships. The team was led by its captains, Consensus First Team All-American Russ Smith, 2013 Final Four MOP Luke Hancock and Montrezl Harrell.\nRoster.\nOn January 10, 2014, Rick Pitino and Kevin Ware jointly announced that Ware would sit out the remainder of the season and take a medical redshirt. In Louisville's December 17 win over Missouri State, Ware was kicked in the same right leg he had severely fractured during the Cardinals' 2013 NCAA tournament win over Duke. Under NCAA rules, a player qualifies for a medical redshirt if he appears in fewer than 30 percent of his team's games, with no appearances in the second half of the season. Ware played in nine out of a total of 31 scheduled games; the Missouri State game was Louisville's 11th of the season. Shortly after the Cardinals' exit from the NCAA tournament, Ware announced that he would transfer from Louisville. On April 12, Ware confirmed to \"ESPN.com\" that his destination would be Georgia State, near his family's current Atlanta-area home.\nRegular season.\nOut of conference.\nLouisville opened with two exhibition victories and 2 wins at home. They played in the Hall of Fame Classic, advancing to the finals where they fell to #24 North Carolina 93–84. They finished out their non-conference slate with 5 victories, including a 79–63 win over Western Kentucky in the Billy Minardi Classic, and a loss at Rupp Arena to archrival #18 Kentucky. They entered American Athletic Conference play with an 11–2 record.\nAmerican Athletic.\nThe Cardinals opened American Athletic play with road victories over UCF and Rutgers before returning home and losing to #24 Memphis. They then went 11–1 in their next 12 games, splitting a home and home with Cincinnati. They lost their second game with Memphis before closing out the season with back to back victories over #18 SMU and #19 UConn on senior day. They finished the regular season with a 26–5 (15–3) record and finished in a tie with Cincinnati as American Athletic Regular Season Champions.\nRuss Smith was named to the Sporting News, Sport Illustrated and NBC Sports All-American First Teams. Russ Smith and Montrezl Harrell were named to the American Athletic Conference All-Conference First Team, and Terry Rozier was named to the American Athletic Conference All-Rookie Team.\nPost-season.\nAmerican Athletic Tournament.\nBy virtue of losing a coin flip the Cardinals were the #2 seed in the tournament and faced Rutgers in the quarterfinal round. They set an AAC record for margin of victory with a 61-point defeat of the Scarlet Knights, 92–31. They defeated Houston in the semi-finals 94–65. Russ Smith set an AAC scoring record and Louisville tournament scoring record with 42 points against the Cougars. The Cardinals won the AAC tournament championship game against #21 UConn by the score of 71–61. This was the Cardinals first AAC tournament championship, in their only year in the conference. Russ Smith won the AAC tournament Most Outstanding player award. Smith, Montrezl Harrell and Luke Hancock were named to the AAC All-tournament First Team.\nThe Cardinals have won three consecutive conference tournament championships (two in the Big East and one in the AAC).\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Cardinals earned a #4 seed in the Midwest region and defeated Manhattan in the second round by a score of 71–64. They defeated #5 seed St. Louis in the third round, but their reign as defending champs ended when the Cardinals were dethroned by #8 Kentucky 74–69 in the Sweet 16, finishing 31–6.\nSchedule.\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ad0000; color:#fff;\"| Exhibition\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ad0000; color:#fff;\"| Regular season\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ad0000; color:#fff;\"| American Athletic Conference tournament\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ad0000; color:#fff;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1883",
        "text": "In 1883, Somerset County Cricket Club played their second season of first-class cricket. They were captained by Stephen Newton, and played in seven matches, six against county opposition, and one against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). They won only one of their seven contests, that against Hampshire at Taunton. Of the remaining matches, the one against the MCC was drawn, and the other five were all losses for Somerset.\nAlthough Somerset's matches in 1883 are considered by modern consensus to hold first-class status, at the time they were held by many publications to only be a second-class side. The quality of the team was limited by Somerset's tight finances, which meant they struggled to hire good professional players, and team selection was often based on social status or boasts, rather than demonstrated ability. The team's bowling was particularly criticised, while their batting received faint praise. Against Gloucestershire, Ted Sainsbury scored the first century for Somerset in first-class cricket, and Francis Terry scored the second in Somerset's last match of the season, against Hampshire.\nBackground.\nSomerset County Cricket Club (often referred to in 19th-century news reports as Somersetshire) was formed in 1875, and played irregular county fixtures in the years after that, during which time they struggled to remain financially solvent. Upon their formation, the club had no fixed home ground, and it was declared that they would play \"on any ground in the county that may be selected by the committee.\" However, in 1881, they moved into the newly built Athletic Grounds in Taunton. Although \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", which most modern statistics are based upon, placed Somerset's debut first-class match in 1882, some records do include earlier matches in 1879 and 1881 against Gloucestershire as being of first-class status. Partly due to the lack of availability of some of their best players, \"Wisden\" described their inaugural 1882 campaign, during which Somerset lost six of their eight fixtures, as \"a disastrous season\".\nThe status of Somerset as a first-class county in 1883 was still ambiguous in the contemporary press; while \"The Sportsman\" and \"Wisden\" included them amongst the first-class statistics, other publications such as \"\" and \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" did not. The season summary provided by \"The Manchester Guardian\" included \"an expression of surprise that Somerset and Hampshire should be included in the list of first-class counties\", while \"The Daily Telegraph\" suggested that Somerset needed to improve their performances if they wanted to be considered a first-class side.\nSquad.\nIn their seven first-class matches in 1883, Somerset fielded 20 different players. In his history of Somerset cricket, David Foot said that selection during this period \"was inclined to be determined with a nod and a wink over drinks\". Foot said that it was common for new players to be included based on exaggerated tales of their abilities, rather than any due diligence taking place. Somerset relied heavily upon amateur players, and this often meant that some of their better cricketers were not always available for games due to their commitments outside the sport. Only two players appeared in all seven fixtures: Edward Bastard and Arnold Fothergill, the latter of whom was one of three professionals to play for Somerset in 1883. Somerset's ability to recruit good professionals was limited by two key factors; their finances and local availability. Throughout their early existence, Somerset struggled financially, and professional players cost considerably more than amateurs, the latter of whom were only allowed to claim expenses.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first-class cricket in 1883. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (30 July 1883).\nCounty cricket.\nSummary.\nSomerset began their season against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in London on 30 July. According to \"Cricket\", neither side was at full-strength, and the bowlers available were particularly weak, resulting in a high-scoring draw. Somerset batted first, and other than Ted Sainsbury, whose batting to score 51 runs was described as \"marked by great care and judgment\" by the \"Bristol Mercury\", they struggled early on, losing five wickets for 130 runs by lunchtime. However, a century partnership between Joe Ambler (who scored 76) and Francis Terry (54) took Somerset to 302. The match was rain interrupted on both days; Somerset bowled the MCC out for 195 in their first innings, including four wickets from Ambler, but were unable to bowl them out again, leaving the MCC on 214 for nine at the end of the match.\nIn Somerset's first county match of the season, they suffered a heavy loss to Surrey at the Kennington Oval in London. Somerset batted first and scored 84 runs; a report in the \"Daily Bristol Times and Mirror\" described Somerset's batting as \"unaccountably weak\". Surrey responded with 449 runs in their first innings, and then bowled Somerset out for a second time on day two for 152 runs. Somerset lost the match by an innings and 213 runs, a result which remains one of their heaviest defeats. Somerset next faced Hampshire at Day's Ground in Southampton, another side which some contemporary publications considered to be second-class, rather than first-class. \"The Morning Post\" noted that Somerset were missing some players for the match, but criticised the team's \"feeble resistance\" to the Hampshire bowling. Roe was Somerset's top-scorer in the first innings, scoring 45 of the county's total of 102. Hampshire then scored 251, and until Fothergill and Bastard came together at the crease, Somerset looked like they would again lose by an innings. The pair added 74 runs together, and forced Hampshire to bat again. Hampshire reached their target with ease, and beat Somerset by seven wickets.\nSomerset then played back-to-back matches against Gloucestershire. The first game, played at Clifton College Close Ground, started on a wet wicket. Both sides' first-innings scores were low; Gloucestershire scored 131, and Somerset 98. In the second innings, Fothergill took five wickets for Somerset, but Gloucestershire amassed 231 runs, giving them a big lead. Somerset fell well short of the winning target, and lost by 114 runs. In the return fixture in Taunton, Gloucestershire batted first and scored 371. In response, Somerset made 179, of which Sainsbury scored 59, James Parfitt 29 and Roe 26. As they were so many runs behind Gloucestershire's total, they were forced to follow-on and bat again. Sainsbury was once again Somerset's highest scorer in their second innings; he made 116, the first century for Somerset in a first-class fixture. Two other Somerset players hit half-centuries; Newton with 63 and Alfred Evans 59. Somerset finished their innings on 343, giving them a 151-run lead. Gloucestershire chased down the winning total in two hours, and won by eight wickets.\nAgainst Surrey at Taunton, Somerset had the better of the first innings. Surrey scored 193, during which Evans took five wickets for Somerset. In reply, Somerset reached 228; Newton scored 38, Sainsbury 37, Joe Ambler 35 and Fred Welman 33. Surrey then reached a similar total in the second innings, scoring 195. In both innings, their top-scorer was Walter Read, who was unbeaten in both innings on 93 and 86. Somerset succumbed to the bowling of Ted Barratt, and only made 85 runs in their second innings, losing by 75 runs. Somerset's final fixture of the season was at Taunton against Hampshire. Somerset batted first and scored 251, principally due to an aggressive effort from Francis Terry, who scored 121. Newton scored a more patient 41, and Fothergill got 23. Fothergill was also a crucial part of Somerset's bowling; he took six wickets in the first innings to help restrict Hampshire to 126, and then a further four when Hampshire followed-on. Hampshire scored 222 in their second-innings to lead by 97 runs. Somerset lost five wickets as they chased down the total; Evans scored 27 and Terry 20, and Somerset won their only game of the season.\nAftermath.\nIn their summary of the season, the \"Taunton Courier\" highlighted Somerset's bowling as \"the weak point in the county team\", while generally praising the batting averages. Similar analysis was provided by the \"Bath Chronicle\", which said: \"The scoring has been fairly good, but ... the less said about the bowling the better.\" Across their four first-class seasons from 1882 to 1885, Somerset only achieved four victories; one each season against Hampshire. As a result, Somerset lost their first-class status for 1886."

        "title": "Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery",
        "text": "Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery (also released as Scooby-Doo! The WWE Mystery) is a 2014 direct-to-DVD animated comedy mystery film, and the twenty-second film in the direct-to-video series of \"Scooby-Doo\" films. It is a co-production between Warner Bros. Animation and WWE Studios. The film features Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania. It was released on March 24, 2014 in the United Kingdom and on March 25, 2014 in the United States by Warner Home Video.\nPlot.\nShaggy Rogers and his dog Scooby-Doo beat the hardest level of the WWE's latest video game and win an all-expenses-paid stay at WWE City to watch WrestleMania. At the pair's insistence, their friends Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley agree to join them. Upon their arrival, the gang meet John Cena, who gives the gang VIP tickets for the next event; his trainer Cookie; and Cookie's nephew Ruben.\nAs the show gets underway, Mr. McMahon unveils the WWE Championship belt, the title for which was vacated due to Kane's previous match being overturned and is now available over the weekend. Later that night, Daphne and Velma overhear Ruben and Cookie arguing over the latter not becoming a WWE wrestler due to his leg injury. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby are attacked by a \"Ghost Bear\". Triple H and Brodus Clay intervene, but the monster overpowers them before disappearing. The following morning, Mystery Inc. learn from WWE executive Ms. Richards that the Ghost Bear has been terrorizing WWE City for the past few weeks. After McMahon asks the gang to solve the mystery to protect the WWE belt, Cena and Sin Cara explain that the Ghost Bear originated over a century prior, when a wrestling bear called Vicious was defeated by Cara's ancestor, Sin Cara Grande, on the land that WWE City would later be built on. Furious over the loss, Vicious attacked the town until Grande banished it to a nearby cave, at the cost of his leg and career. Cara fears that Vicious' spirit was stirred by WrestleMania and is now seeking revenge.\nThe next day, Scooby is caught stealing the WWE belt, though Velma proves he was in a state of deep hypnosis during the act while Rueben deduces the video game contained flashing lights that implanted post-hypnotic suggestions into Scooby's brain. Despite this, McMahon offers Scooby and Shaggy a chance at freedom if they can defeat Kane at WrestleMania. With Cookie and AJ Lee's help, the pair undergo a crash course in wrestling. Meanwhile, the rest of Mystery Inc. investigate the cave that Vicious was said to have been banished to. Inside, they discover a hidden room containing hypnosis books, schematics for an EMP device, and a calendar confirming the culprit plans to target WrestleMania. Suddenly, the Ghost Bear attacks the group, forcing them into a storm drain, though Cena fights it off before realizing the drain leads directly underneath WWE City. After the gang inform Richards of their discovery, Cookie advocates for WrestleMania's cancellation, but Fred suggests using the event to lure and capture the Ghost Bear.\nDuring Scooby, Shaggy, and Kane's fight, Velma deduces the WWE belt is a fake and contains the EMP device. Cena tries to take it out of the arena, but it activates, shutting down the underground generator. The Ghost Bear soon arrives and wreaks havoc, but the wrestlers use pyrotechnics to illuminate the arena while Scooby and Kane continue their fight. When the Ghost Bear attacks the ring, Scooby and Kane join forces with Ruben, Cena, and Cara to defeat it and unmask it as Cookie. Feeling his career ended too soon, he reveals that he sought to steal the WWE belt, tarnish the organization's reputation, and built an exosuit to help him achieve his plot.\nAs Cookie is arrested, Cena recovers the real WWE belt and McMahon offers Ruben a place on the WWE roster before awarding the belt to Scooby and Shaggy.\nVoice cast.\nAdditionally, Sin Cara, Jerry Lawler, Sgt. Slaughter, Jimmy Hart, Big Show, Alberto Del Rio, Cameron, Naomi, and the \"Young Justice\" incarnations of Wonder Girl, Artemis, Zatanna, and Miss Martian all make non-speaking cameo appearances.\nProduction.\nOn August 14, 2012, Warner Bros. and WWE Studios announced that they would co-produce a Scooby-Doo animated feature that will find Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania.\nSoundtrack.\nThe original music score was composed by Ryan Shore. The film also features the WWE entrance music themes of The Miz, Mr. McMahon, John Cena, Kane, and AJ Lee.\nCritical reception.\nMatt Fowler of IGN gave the film a \"Mediocre\" score of 5.0 out of 10, citing that \"\"Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery\" will most definitely delight your children, whether they're fans of one, or both, properties. It's well-meaning, snappily animated, and it's fun to hear the [wrestlers] do their own voices.\"\nTelevision retitling.\nIn its television premiere on Cartoon Network on Saturday, July 26, 2014, the film was retitled \"Scooby-Doo! The WWE Mystery\" and the event the gang are in WWE City to witness was renamed \"SuperStar-Mania\". This film is the first of the animated films to get a TV-PG rating for \"violence\" due to the plot of the film involving wrestling. All previous \"Scooby-Doo\" animated films received a TV-Y7-FV rating.\nSequel.\nOn September 15, 2014, WWE and Warner Bros. announced a direct sequel to \"WrestleMania Mystery\" to be released in 2016 by the name of \"Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon\". Hulk Hogan was billed to be prominently featured. However, on July 23, 2015, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan due to racist comments, leaving speculation as to his appearance in the film.\nIn the UK, the film was released on August 8, 2016.\nFollow-up film.\n\"Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy\" was released on August 19, 2014."

The original 20 teams represented six countries.\nThe pool stage began on 10 October 2013 and ran until 19 January 2014, followed by the knockout stages. The final was originally to be held in France in May 2014, however the Federation Française de Rugby subsequently announced that they had withdrawn their application to host due to uncertainty over the availability of Stade de France.

The Heineken Cup would be replaced by a new top-tier competition, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which would continue to involve clubs from all of the top six European nations, but featuring 20 clubs instead of the 24 in the Heineken Cup.

        "title": "South Africa cricket match fixing",
        "text": "South Africa cricket match fixing refers to match fixing performed by several players of the South African cricket team, during their tour to India in the year 2000. The team was led by Hansie Cronje.\nTimeline.\nOn 7 April 2000, Delhi police Crime Branch officer Ishwar Singh Redhu revealed they had a recording of a conversation between Cronje and Sanjay Chawla, a representative of an Indian betting syndicate, over match-fixing allegations. Three other players, Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje, and Pieter Strydom, were also implicated.\nOn 8 April 2000, the United Cricket Board of South Africa denied their players were involved in match-fixing. Cronje said \"the allegations are completely without substance\". However, on 11 April Cronje was sacked as captain after confessing to Ali Bacher that he had not been \"entirely honest\". He admitted accepting between $10,000 to $15,000 from a London-based bookmaker for 'forecasting' results, not match fixing, during the recent one day series in India.\nIn May 2000, the South African president Thabo Mbeki appointed a Commission of Inquiry into Cricket Match Fixing and Related Matters, with judge Edwin King as chairperson. On 7 June, the King Commission began. The following day, Gibbs revealed that Cronje had offered him $15,000 to score less than 20 runs in the 5th ODI at Nagpur. He also admitted another offer of $15,000 to Henry Williams to concede more than 50 runs in that same match. Gibbs scored 74 off 53 balls and Williams injured his shoulder and couldn't complete his second over, so neither received the $15,000. Off-spinner Derek Crookes, who was also a witness, admitted being surprised to open the bowling at Nagpur.\nOn 15 June, Cronje released a statement that revealed all his contact with bookmakers. In 1996 during the third Test in Kanpur, he was introduced to Mukesh Gupta by Mohammad Azharuddin. Gupta gave Cronje $30,000 to persuade the South Africans to lose wickets on the last day to lose the match. South Africa were 127/5 chasing 460, Cronje was already out and spoke to no other players. \"I had received money for doing nothing.\" During the return tour, Cronje received $50,000 from Gupta for team information.\nIn the 2000 Centurion Test, Marlon Aronstam contacted him offering R500,000 (approximately £50,000 at the time) for the charity of his choice together with a gift if Cronje declared and made a game of it. He also admitted asking Pieter Strydom to place a R50 bet on South Africa to win for him. After the match Aronstam visited Cronje, giving him two amounts of money (R30,000 and R20,000) together with a leather jacket. The promised R500,000 did not materialise. Before the one-day series, Cronje received repeated calls from \"Sanjay\" asking him to fix a match. Cronje gave him the names of Gibbs, Strydom and Boje to try to get rid of him. Cronje was offered $140,000 for the fifth ODI if Gibbs scored under 20, Williams went for more than 50 and South Africa scored around 270.\nOn 28 August, Gibbs and Williams were suspended from international cricket for six months. Gibbs was fined R60,000 and Williams R10,000. Strydom received no punishment.\nOn 11 October, Cronje was banned from playing or coaching cricket for life. He challenged his life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001, his application was dismissed.\nCronje was killed in a private plane accident in 2002.\nSubsequent reporting on Cronje's involvement in match-fixing revealed that Cronje had more than 70 bank accounts in the Cayman Islands which were, because they were not declared to the South African Revenue Service, illegal. The South African investigation was terminated at his death: but the implication of the multiple accounts was that the match-fixing was much more widespread than had been revealed to the King Commission. \nAfter 13 years on 22 July 2013 the Delhi Police registered an FIR for match-fixing in 2000, the chargesheet in the case involving several South African cricketers including Cronje."

        "title": "2002 Wales rugby union tour of South Africa",
        "text": "The Wales national rugby union team toured South Africa in June 2002 for a two-match test series against the South Africa national team. Wales lost the series 2–0, going down 34–19 in the first test and 19–8 in the second. They also played a pre-tour match against the Barbarians, losing 40–25 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nIt was Steve Hansen's first tour as Wales coach, having taken over in a caretaker capacity after Graham Henry resigned during the 2002 Six Nations Championship. Six Wales players made their test debuts on the tour, including Michael Owen, who became his country's 1,000th test player when he started the first test.\nSquads.\nWales.\nFollowing the resignation of Graham Henry as Wales coach in February 2002, forwards coach Steve Hansen was appointed as caretaker for the remainder of the 2002 Six Nations Championship. He was given the job permanently on a two-year contract on 5 April 2002, which meant the tour to South Africa would be his first as head coach of Wales. He named an initial squad of 27 for the tour, including five uncapped players, all forwards for the Pontypridd side that won the Principality Cup and reached the final of the Parker Pen Shield: Mefin Davies, Gethin Jenkins, Robert Sidoli, Richard Parks and Michael Owen; there were also recalls for lock Steve Williams, five years after his last appearance, and prop Ben Evans. Fly-half Neil Jenkins, who last appeared for Wales in their win over Italy in the 2001 Six Nations, was also included in the squad, but it was expected that he would only play in the event of injuries. Surprise omissions from the squad included locks Ian Gough, Craig Quinnell and Chris Wyatt, hooker Barry Williams and flanker Brett Sinkinson, while Scott Quinnell, Gareth Thomas, Spencer John, Andy Moore, Nathan Bonner-Evans, Mark Jones and Nathan Budgett were all left out due to injury.\nNeath centre James Storey – who qualified to play for Wales on residency grounds on 1 June 2002 – and Cardiff scrum-half Ryan Powell were called up in May 2002 after Gareth Cooper (foot) and Dafydd James (elbow) were ruled out due to injury. Fly-half Iestyn Harris pulled out with a groin injury on 18 May 2002; no replacement was called up as Neil Jenkins was already in the squad in that capacity. Uncapped prop Martyn Madden was added to the squad after Chris Anthony injured his shoulder in training ahead of the match against the Barbarians.\nSouth Africa.\nLike Wales, South Africa appointed a new coach for the tour, following the resignation of Harry Viljoen in January 2002; he was replaced by former Bedford and Coastal Sharks coach Rudolf Straeuli. Ahead of naming the squad for the Wales series, the South Africa player pool was hit by an exodus; several players made moves to European clubs, but South African Rugby Union policy prohibited players not based in South Africa from playing for the national team. As well as several who had moved the previous year, prop Robbie Kempson and wing Pieter Rossouw agreed moves to London Irish and Ulster respectively on 2 May 2002, back-row forward Andre Vos joined Harlequins on 13 May, and full-back Thinus Delport joined Gloucester on 15 May. Full-back Percy Montgomery ruled himself out of the national trial game on 19 May after expressing a desire to move to Europe; he signed for Newport on 29 May 2002, joining fellow former Springbok Adrian Garvey.\nOn 14 May, Straeuli named 46 players for an intra-squad trial match to be played at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on 19 May; the group included 18 uncapped players, including South Africa Sevens internationals Brent Russell and Egon Seconds, and under-21s Francois Swart, Clyde Rathbone and Jean de Villiers. They were divided into two teams: Team White was captained by Bobby Skinstad and Team Blue was led by Corne Krige. Team Blue led 22–12 at half time, but Team White came back in the second half to win 57–48.\nMatches.\nWales vs Barbarians.\nThe game against Wales was Rod Macqueen's second as Barbarians coach, following their game against England three days earlier, having been appointed for the tour in March 2002. His initial squad for the tour included seven South Africans, among them loosehead prop Robbie Kempson, who had recently ended his international career after agreeing a move to Ulster. South African full-back Percy Montgomery was added on 16 May, having also indicated his intention to move to Europe. Seven players pulled out of the game against Wales, having picked up injuries against England, prompting the short-notice call-ups of the likes of Doddie Weir, Jamie Noon and former Cardiff wing Liam Botham. For Wales, locks Steve Williams and Gareth Llewellyn were recalled after long spells out of the team; Llewellyn had not started for his country since their final pool match of the 1999 Rugby World Cup against Samoa, while Williams' last appearance was as a replacement against New Zealand in November 1997. Dwayne Peel started at scrum-half in place of the retired Rob Howley; his half-back partner was his Llanelli teammate Stephen Jones, following a groin injury to Iestyn Harris, while Neil Jenkins provided outside half cover from the bench. Coach Steve Hansen waited to name his full bench until after the Parker Pen Shield final, resting his decision on the fitness of the Pontypridd forwards involved in that game: Gethin Jenkins, Robert Sidoli, Richard Parks and Michael Owen. Following the injury to Chris Anthony in training for the game, Ben Evans was promoted from the bench to the starting line-up, allowing Jenkins to take his place among the replacements, joined by Sidoli and Parks; Owen was the only one of the Ponty four to miss out.\nWales opened the scoring in the 12th minute thanks to a penalty from Jones, before a chip-and-chase from Peel led to the first try of the game for Mark Taylor five minutes later. Jones missed the conversion, but added another penalty to extend the lead to 11–0 as the game moved into the second quarter. In the last 10 minutes of the half, Wales added another two tries; first, Craig Morgan finished an attacking move out wide, before Gavin Thomas managed to finish under the posts following good work by fellow back-rowers Martyn Williams and Colin Charvis. Jones converted both tries to give Wales a 25–0 lead at half-time. At the interval, brought Jenkins and Parks on in place of Iestyn Thomas and Martyn Williams, and within a minute of the restart he was forced into another change as Jamie Robinson came on for the injured Andy Marinos. Soon after, the Barbarians scored their first try thanks to Ollie Smith, with the conversion added by Braam van Straaten. Five minutes later, Thinus Delport ran in another score and Van Straaten again added the extras. As the game entered its final 20 minutes, the Barbarians took the lead with two quickfire tries; Delport scored his second in the 62nd minute, before Newport's South African prop Adrian Garvey crossed in the 65th, and Van Straaten converted both to give the Barbarians a 28–25 lead. Van Straaten kept up his 100% kicking record after Garvey scored a second try as the game drew to a close, only to miss the conversion as captain Pat Lam completed the scoring in injury time.\nFirst test.\nIn the first test, Wales led after the first 20 minutes, but tries from Marius Joubert and Bobby Skinstad gave the first advantage (15-11) for the victorious Springboks.\nSecond test.\nWales again lost, but played a \"fiercely contested\" match according to BBC Sport. The tour showed the improvement that the coach Steve Hansen was waiting for."

Twice that season he was named the SoCon Player of the Week. The Catamounts finished second in the conference behind Phillips' play. The next season, Phillips increased his averages to 16.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, was named a First Team All-SoCon member, and was named the SoCon co-Player of the Year with Furman's Chuck Vincent.\nHe was never selected in the 1998 NBA draft, so Phillips headed to Europe to play professionally.

The following season, he racked up a team-leading 530 total points, ranked fourth in the league.\nIn the 2010–11 season, he was sidelined with ankle ligament injury. He came back from the injury prior to the 2010-11 postseason but struggled throughout the postseason, scoring only 20 points in three semi-playoff games.\nIn the 2011–12 season, Kim converted his position to opposite spiker to fill a void at opposite spiker after an injury to Milan Pepic. As an opposite spiker, Kim had another breakout season, scoring a career-high 671 points.\nPrior to the 2012-13 V-League season, Kim helped the Greaters win their first KOVO Cup, scoring over 20 points every game during the tourney, and eventually earned MVP honors. The Greaters, however, finished the 2012-13 regular season in fifth place, failing to reach the postseason.\nKim was named the Greaters' captain in 2012. However, his team and individual performance deteriorated during his captaincy reign. From 2012 to 2017 the Greaters missed the playoffs and Kim's offensive stats declined gradually, plagued by ankle and waist problems.\nAfter the 2016–17 season, Kim was traded to OK Savings Bank Rush &amp; Cash, and converted his position to middle blocker due to his chronic waist injuries.\nNational team.\nWhile attending Inha University in 2005, Kim got called up to the South Korean national under-21 team for the 2005 World Junior Championship, where South Korea finished in sixth place.\nAs a junior at Inha University in 2006 Kim first joined the South Korean senior national team to compete in the 2006 Asian Games, where South Korea won gold."

        "text": "The \"Cricket\" class and following classes of coastal destroyers were a series of small torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) intended to complement the Royal Navy's s. The thirty-six vessels which broadly comprised this group actually consisted of several distinct classes, as each contractor built to their own designs, and even single contractor's designs evolved from year to year.\nThe first twelve vessels (comprising White's \"Cricket\" class, Thornycroft's \"Gadfly\" class and Yarrow's \"Mayfly\" class) were ordered in 1905 and launched in early 1906. In practice they were not strong enough for open ocean operations and were reclassified as 1st class torpedo boats. These first twelve had been given names but in October 1906 - after the first two vessels ran trials but before any had been delivered - all were then given the numbers \"TB 1\" to \"TB 12\" and their names were withdrawn.\nThe following two batches—each of twelve more boats, comprising \"TB 13\" to \"TB 24\" ordered under the 1906–07 Programme, and \"TB 25\" to \"TB 36\" under the 1907–08 Programme—were only ever given numbers and were on average longer. These were only ever classified as 1st class torpedo boats. The last boat was launched in 1909. Those that survived the war (six were wartime losses - four from the 1905-06 batch and two from the 1906-07 batch) were sold off from 1919 to 1921.\nThey were built by six different yards (thirteen by White at Cowes, nine by Thornycroft (five at Chiswick and four at Woolston, Hampshire), four each by Denny at Dumbarton and by Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn, and three each by Yarrow at Cubitt Town and by Palmers at Jarrow).\nThe boats differed in detail as each shipbuilder was allowed to construct to their own design, and the designs were modified and enlarged for the later batches, but all had two funnels with one of the torpedo tubes on the stern. These vessels closely resembled the earliest 26-knotter TBDs of 1892–93, having 'turtle-back' forecastles and carried a similar armament.\nBy 1914 all boats were serving in North Sea Patrol Flotillas or the Nore Local Defence Flotilla. \"TB 4\" and \"TB 24\" won the Battle Honour \"Belgian Coast 1915\". In 1918 the four Denny-built boats were sent to the Mediterranean: \"TB 17\" and \"TB 18\" served at Gibraltar, \"TB 29\" and \"TB 30\" at Malta, where these went to the breakers in 1919.\n\"Cricket\"-class (\"TB.1\" to \"TB.5\" - J. S. White 1905–1906 programme).\nJ Samuel White's torpedo boats of the 1905–1906 shipbuilding programme were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. The ships had turtleback forecastles and two funnels. Two oil-fuelled Yarrow water-tube boilers fed steam to three-stage Parsons steam turbines, driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was designed to give , with a speed of specified.\nArmament consisted of two 12-pounder (76-mm) 12 cwt guns, and three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (in three single mounts). The ships had a crew of 39.\n\"Gadfly\"-class (\"TB.6\" to \"TB.10\" - Thornycroft boats - 1905–1906 programme).\nThornycroft's torpedo boats under the 1905–1906 programme were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of .

        "text": "The 2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team represented Wichita State University in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, which had a capacity of 10,506. They were in their 69th season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. They were led by seventh-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They were the last team to finish the regular season and enter the NCAA tournament unbeaten until Kentucky did it the next year.\nThe 2013–14 season was arguably the best season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history. After defeating Missouri State on March 1, 2014, Wichita State became the first men's Division I team ever to finish the regular season 31–0 (Kentucky matched it the next year), the first team to finish 18–0 in conference play in the Missouri Valley Conference since the 1985–86 Bradley Braves, as well as the first to finish the regular season undefeated since Saint Joseph's in 2003–04. The team's 35–0 start was the best men's Division I start ever (before Kentucky started 38-0 the next year), beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls, the highest final national ranking in school history. Though some analysts noted that Wichita State's schedule was relatively easy compared to previous teams that finished the regular season primarily because none of their opponents throughout the season were ranked when they played them, as well as only beating one opponent that was ranked at any point in the season (Saint Louis, who also had a lack of quality wins).\nThey entered the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated.\nPreseason.\nIn the 2012–13 college basketball season, the Wichita State University Shockers, under sixth-year head coach Gregg Marshall, finished the season 30–9 and 12–6 in Missouri Valley play to finish in second place. They advanced to the championship game of the Missouri Valley Tournament where they lost to Creighton. They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament, receiving a 9 seed in the West Region, where they defeated 8 seed Pittsburgh and 1 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the West Region semifinals they defeated 13 seed La Salle and 2 seed Ohio State in the regional finals to be crowned West Region Champions and advance to the Final Four for the second time in school history and first time since 1965. In the Final Four, they lost to eventual-champion Louisville, 72–68. Wichita State was ranked #4 in the final Coach's Poll of the 2012-13 season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Missouri Valley Conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Missouri Valley Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| NCAA tournament\nHonors.\nFred VanVleet was named one of the ten semi-finalists for the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.

        "text": "Dominique “Dom” Ducharme (born March 12, 1973) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently an assistant coach for the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League. Previously, he was the former head coach of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL) during the second half of the 2020–2021 season and the beginning of the 2021–2022 season.\nPlaying career.\nDucharme had a four-year standout career playing for the University of Vermont's men's ice hockey team. He ranks ninth all-time in points with 149, and seventh all-time in assists with 93 at UVM while playing alongside the likes of future NHLers and Stanley Cup champions Martin St. Louis and Tim Thomas.\nAfter graduation, Ducharme began his professional career with splitting time between the Raleigh IceCaps and Huntington Blizzard of the ECHL along with the Cornwall Aces of the AHL in 1995–96. After that, he embarked on a five-year career in the French leagues, before retiring in 2002.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Ducharme spent one season as a coach for the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres team in 2002–03. In 2004, Ducharme took his first head coaching job, working with his hometown junior team, the Joliette L'Action in the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League. He stayed there until 2008, when he accepted a position as an assistant coach with the Montreal Junior Hockey Club in the QMJHL, until taking a job with the Halifax Mooseheads in 2011.\nDucharme's first season with the Mooseheads saw the team finish 6th overall in the QMJHL, and second in the Maritimes Division reaching the semifinals of the President's Cup. In 2012–13, with top NHL Draft prospects like Nathan MacKinnon and Jonathan Drouin, Ducharme and the Mooseheads went 58–6–3–1, registering 347 goals for and only 176 goals against. In the 2013 President's Cup playoffs, Halifax lost just one game to capture its first QMJHL crown in team history. With automatic entry in to the 2013 Memorial Cup, the Mooseheads defeated the Portland Winterhawks 6–4, to win its first Memorial Cup title, and become the third-straight QMJHL team to win the tournament in as many years. For his efforts, Ducharme was awarded with the Ron Lapointe Trophy as the QMHJL's Coach of the Year.\nFollowing the 2015–16 QMJHL season, Ducharme resigned his position with the Mooseheads and joined Drummondville as both head coach and general manager.\nDucharme has also been involved with Hockey Canada, first assisting on Quebec in the 2011 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge, and as an assistant coach for the Canada Under-18 National Team at the 2013 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. Ducharme served as the head coach for Canada during the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, leading the team to a silver medal, and the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, leading them to gold.\nOn April 27, 2018, Ducharme was hired as an assistant coach by the Montreal Canadiens, following the firings of J. J. Daigneault and Daniel Lacroix.\nOn February 24, 2021, Ducharme was promoted to interim head coach by the Canadiens, following the termination of Claude Julien and Kirk Muller. \nOn June 19, 2021, Ducharme tested positive for COVID-19, placing him in isolation for 14 days; he continued work through phone calls and video calls, talking with the coaching staff and players as they won their semifinal playoff series against the Vegas Golden Knights, advancing to the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. On July 2, Ducharme rejoined the team for morning skate ahead of Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals. In the first Stanley Cup Finals game at the Bell Centre the Canadiens were defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning by a score of 6–3. The Canadiens would ultimately lose the series 4 games to 1.\nOn July 13, 2021, Ducharme was formally named the 31st head coach in Canadiens history, signing a three-year extension with the team.\nOn February 9, 2022, Ducharme was fired as head coach of the Montreal Canadiens; at the time of his departure, the Canadiens held a record of 8–30–7, last overall in the NHL.\nOn July 12, 2023, Ducharme was hired as an assistant coach for the Vegas Golden Knights."

In addition, North Carolina has finished national runner-up an NCAA record eleven times. The most recent championship, in 2023, was also won by North Carolina.\nHistory.\nField hockey was one of 12 women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same 12 (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA overcame the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership. The first NCAA women's national championship events were staged November 21–22, 1981, in cross country and field hockey.\nThe tournament originally began with six teams but has since expanded to 19; at different times a third-place game has been played as well. Under the tournament's current format, 19 teams qualify for the tournament with three play-in games. The play-in games and first two rounds are played at the home turf of the higher seeds in each matchup.

        "text": "The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup (also referred to as simply the 2023 Cricket World Cup) was the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted from 5 October to 19 November 2023 across ten venues in India.\nThe tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the same format used in 2019. In the knockout stage, India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa respectively to advance to the final, played on 19 November at Narendra Modi Stadium. Australia won by 6 wickets, winning their sixth Cricket World Cup title.\nVirat Kohli was the player of the tournament and also scored the most runs; Mohammed Shami was the leading wicket-taker. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended matches, the highest number in any Cricket World Cup to-date. The tournament final set viewership records in India, with 518 million viewers, and a peak of 57 million streaming viewers.\nBackground.\nOn 11 December 2017, India was announced by the ICC as hosts of the 2023 Cricket World Cup; while India had served as a co-host during three previous tournaments (most recently in 2011, which it co-hosted with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), it would mark the first Cricket World Cup to be hosted solely by India.\nOriginally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023. In July 2020 it was announced that due to the disruption of the qualification schedule by the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the tournament would be delayed to October. The ICC released the tournament schedule on 27 June 2023.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the tournament after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan. This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the tournament would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.\nThis was the first ICC World Cup in which penalties for slow over-rates were given to bowling sides if they did not complete their 50 overs in the stipulated time. On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle.\nQualification.\nOther than India, who qualified as hosts, all teams had to qualify for the tournament through the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa qualified via the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, with the Netherlands and Sri Lanka securing the final two places via the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe during June and July 2023.\nAs a result of the qualifying process, the competition was the first not to include former winners West Indies, who failed to progress for the first time after their defeat to Scotland. Full members Ireland and Zimbabwe also missed out on qualification, meaning three of the four full members who took part in the knock-out qualification stage did not qualify, with only Sri Lanka progressing. The final qualification spot was decided by an eliminator match between associate members Scotland and the Netherlands, with the Dutch side taking the final place.\nVenues.\nThe tournament took place in ten different stadiums, situated in ten different cities across India. The first and second semi-finals were held at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata respectively, while the final took place at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.\nThe BCCI provided funding for renovations and refurbishments at stadiums. Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium received a new grass surface, drainage system, seating, and hospitality boxes. Wankhede Stadium had upgrades to the outfield, floodlights, corporate boxes, and toilets. M. A. Chidambaram Stadium installed new floodlights and relaid two wickets.\nWith the autumn scheduling of this World Cup, the ICC instituted protocols for reducing the impact of moisture—including dew and rain—on pitch conditions, so that they did not give the team batting second an advantage (as had frequently occurred in the 2021 Men's T20 World Cup). These included using a specific wetting agent, and the boundary set at around at each stadium, with more grass on the pitch to encourage seam bowling over spin bowling.\nSquads.\nAll teams were asked to finalise their 15-player squads prior to 28 September, with any replacements after this date requiring approval from the ICC. All squads were announced by 26 September 2023. The oldest player of the tournament was Dutch player Wesley Barresi, who was 39 years old, while the youngest was Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad, who was 18.\nWarm-up matches.\nWarm-up matches were held from 29 September to 3 October 2023 at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Guwahati, and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.\nIndia's warm-up fixtures were announced on 27 June. The complete warm-up fixtures were announced on 23 August. The matches were broadcast live on television.\nGroup stage.\nThe ICC announced the World Cup schedule on 27 June 2023 at an event in Mumbai with a countdown of 100 days to the opening match of the World Cup on 5 October. The group stage started with the match between the finalists of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand and England, at Narendra Modi Stadium. On 9 August 2023, nine fixtures, including the match between India and Pakistan, were rescheduled by the ICC. The top seven teams in the tournament, excluding Pakistan who qualify automatically as host, qualified for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.\nResults.\nThe ICC released the fixture details on 27 June 2023.\nKnockout stage.\nThe host India was the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after their 302-run win against Sri Lanka, their seventh successive win in the World Cup. India secured the top place amongst the semi-finalists after they beat South Africa by 243 runs on 5 November at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\nSouth Africa became the second team to qualify for the semi-finals after Pakistan defeated New Zealand on 4 November, with Australia becoming the third team to qualify after defeating Afghanistan on 7 November. New Zealand confirmed their berth as the fourth team after Pakistan lost their final match against England.\nStatistics.\nTeam of the tournament.\nThe ICC announced its team of the tournament on 21 November 2023 with Virat Kohli being named as player of the tournament, and Rohit Sharma as captain of the team.\nMarketing.\nThe ICC hosted a \"trophy tour\" for 100 days prior to the tournament beginning 27 June, with the Cricket World Cup Trophy being taken to various locations around the world. The event began with the launching of the trophy into the stratosphere and landing at Modi Stadium—becoming the first sports trophy to have ever been sent into space.\nThe ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and female duo named \"Tonk\" and \"Blaze\" from the fictional cricketing utopia \"Crictoverse\".\nThe official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled \"Dil Jashn Bole\" () was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Shloke Lal and Saaveri Verma. The song was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan. However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews.\nAhead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue. The ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final. During this a drone show was held.\nBroadcasting.\nDisney Star served as host broadcaster of the tournament in association with ICC TV; in India, all matches were televised by Star Sports and streamed by Disney+ Hotstar, with coverage available in English and eight regional languages. Amid competition with JioCinema for domestic cricket rights, Disney announced that all matches would be available on Disney+ Hotstar for free on mobile devices. The broadcasts featured expanded player and Hawk-Eye ball tracking features (building upon those introduced in the 2022 men's T20 World Cup) for visualizing shots and fielding, and dedicated vertical video feeds of each match designed for streaming on smartphones. Commentary on the ICC's English-language world feed was led by Ricky Ponting and Eoin Morgan among others.\nThe ICC projected that global live viewing minutes of the tournament had increased by 17% over 2019. In India, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) ratings reported that the final was seen on linear television by 518 million people in India, and Disney reported that streams peaked at 57 million concurrent viewers on Hotstar—both setting new records.\nPrize money.\nThe ICC allocated a pool of US$10 million in prize money for the tournament, with payouts remaining the same as the 2019 and 2015 tournaments. Australia, the winning team, received US$4,000,000, the runner-up $2,000,000 and the losing semi-finalists $1,600,000. Teams that did not progress past the league stage received $100,000 and the winner of each league stage match received $40,000."

        "title": "Jeff Powell (American football)",
        "text": "Jeffrey O'Neal Powell (born May 27, 1963) is a former American football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). Powell also won recognition as an elite hurdler in track and field. Powell played college football for the University of Tennessee and is famous for his 60-yard touchdown in the third quarter during the 1986 Sugar Bowl. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the sixth round of the 1986 NFL Draft, and after his football career, Powell earned a law degree from Vanderbilt University Law School. He currently practices law in Tennessee.\nEarly life.\nPowell was born in Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Whites Creek Comprehensive High School where he lettered in both track and football. In addition to his athletic achievements, he was an honor student there. In 1981, Powell set a Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) record in track for the 110-meter high hurdle event. Powell's peers elected him \"Most Athletic\" among the senior superlatives of the Class of 1982. That summer, Jeff Powell represented the United States during the second Pan American Junior Athletics Championships held in Barquisimeto, Venezuela where he earned the silver medal in the 110-metre hurdles.\nCollege career.\nJeff Powell's athletic versatility is evident through the numerous awards he earned as a hurdler and as a running back. Powell's academic talent equaled his athletic abilities. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in Accounting from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1986.\nWilliam &amp; Mary.\nPowell enrolled at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1982. During his freshman year, he earned the State Champion title for the 60-meter high hurdles. Powell was also a member of the Tribe football team in 1982. On April 26, 1984, Jeff Powell set a William &amp; Mary record for outdoor track events. At the Penn Relay Carnival, he completed the 110-meter hurdles in 13.90 seconds. Powell was also named a 1984 All-American for the indoor track 55-meter hurdles event.\nTennessee.\nTo increase opportunities to run track, in 1984, Powell transferred to the University of Tennessee, located in Knoxville, Tennessee. That same year, he finished fourth in the 110-meter high hurdles at the NCAA Indoor Championships. Powell would join the Volunteers' football team during spring practice in 1985, when he was awarded the team's final scholarship by Coach Johnny Majors. He was a backup for most of the season, but received substantial playing time late in the season after starters Charles Wilson and Keith Davis struggled with injuries. He ran for 60 yards on 13 carries against Ole Miss, and 88 yards on 16 carries against Kentucky. For the regular season, he ran for 235 yards on 55 carries. Exhibiting his talent on special teams, Powell returned seven kickoffs for 145 yards.\n1986 Sugar Bowl.\nJeff Powell is perhaps best remembered among Vol fans for his performance in Tennessee's 35–7 victory over Miami in the 1986 Sugar Bowl, in which he ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. On January 1, 1986, the #8 ranked Tennessee Volunteers were matched with the #2 ranked University of Miami Hurricanes at the Superdome located in New Orleans, Louisiana. During the 3rd quarter, Powell ran off-tackle and out-sprinted Hurricane safeties Bennie Blades and Selwyn Brown for 60 yards to the end zone. It was during this run that legendary Volunteers broadcaster John Ward made his well-known \"5-4-3-2-1 ... sixty yards ... Jeff Powell!\" call. Powell's touchdown and the ensuing extra point gave Tennessee a 28-7 lead over the Hurricanes and blew the game wide open.\nNFL career.\nAs Powell was completing his undergraduate degree requirements, the Chicago Bears drafted him in the sixth round (166th overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft and later traded him to the San Diego Chargers. Powell's career in the NFL did not last very long. He appeared for only one game during the 1987 season. He did not record any statistics other than his appearance.\nLaw career.\nPowell enrolled in Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville, Tennessee in the fall of 1989. He earned a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in May 1992, and passed the Tennessee bar examination shortly thereafter. Today, he is an attorney practicing law in Tennessee."

        "text": "The North Sea Cup was an annual rugby union championship for club teams from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, held since 2011. The championship was sanctioned by rugby's European governing body, the FIRA – Association of European Rugby (FIRA-AER).\nHistory.\n2011–12.\nThe first edition of the competition was held in 2011–12, with six clubs participating, two from each of the three countries. The competition consisted of Boitsfort RC and Royal Kituro Rugby Club from Belgium, SC 1880 Frankfurt and Heidelberger RK from Germany and RC Hilversum and RC The Dukes from the Netherlands. In the first edition, each team was scheduled to play four games, playing only the clubs from the other two countries but not the team from their own. However, the last round was canceled, leaving each team with only three games played. At the end, the top two teams played a final, which was contested by Heidelberg and Frankfurt, with the later winning 26–19, a surprise result given that Heidelberg had just won the German championship and been defeated only once all season, while Frankfurt had been knocked out in the semi-final of this competition.\nThe winners and runners-up of this competition then met the champions of the Baltic Cup and the Regional Rugby Championship, RC BaltRex Siauliai and RK Nada in the European Rugby Club Championship. In this competition, Heidelberger RK defeated Siauliai 60–10 in the final. FIRA determined that the North Sea Cup was the strongest of the three regional cups and therefore awarded entry to the semi-finals to two teams from that competition.\n2012–13.\nThe second edition saw the competition expanded to ten clubs in two divisions of five. In Group A the two Belgian clubs Boitsfort RC and Royal Kituro Rugby Club met German sides SC 1880 Frankfurt and SC Neuenheim. The fifth side was a selection from the south of the Netherlands, Regio Team Zuid. Group B was made up of Belgian sides Dendermondse RC and RC Frameries, German clubs Heidelberger RK and TV Pforzheim as well as a selection from the northern Netherlands, Regio Team Noord. Each team only played the other teams in each group, resulting in four games per club. The games against the team from their own country was however a regular season game in the respective Belgian and German national leagues, which was also counted towards the North Sea Cup. Initially, the group winners were then scheduled to play the runners-up of the other group in the semi-finals but fixture congestion resulted in the semi-finals being canceled and the group winners advancing directly to the final. In this game Heidelberger RK defeated Boitsfort RC 34–10.\n2013–14.\nThe third edition of the competition saw the defending champions Heidelberger RK decline participation while former winners Frankfurt were expelled from the cup for canceling its opening game on short notice. Eight teams were participating in the 2013–14 edition, with group A consisting of Regio Team Zuid, a team Belgium South-West, TV Pforzheim and Dendermondse RC. The B group was made up of Boitsfort RC, Royal Kituro Rugby Club, SC Neuenheim and the Regio Team Noord. The competition was once again won by a German club, this time the TV Pforzheim, who defeated Boitsford RC in the final.\nFinals.\nThe finals of the competition:"

Each of the 13 weeks is considered its own horse show, with separate competitions, as well as competitions that run throughout the festival. It is the largest and longest-running equestrian competition in the world. The Winter Equestrian Festival is known for its stunning grounds and villages, stiff competition, and wealth of its participants.\nWellington International, which hosts the equestrian festival, is a venue in Wellington. The grounds of the festival consist of, 18 competition arenas, as well as 400 permanent horse stalls. The Winter Equestrian Festival (WEF) is known for its sprawling grounds and horse themed streets.

The competition has a wide range of divisions for people of all skill level. It offers competitions for children, junior, adult amateur, and professional equestrians in over 70 different divisions In the course of three months, this largest and longest running horse show sees only the best riders of their class: Olympians, adult amateurs, juniors, and children from more than 35 different countries. Among these people and horses are some of the best riders for each division, of those athletes, the United States, and the world.\nWEF began to attract the equestrian community after the 1970s.

        "text": "Sylhet International Cricket Stadium (SICS) () also known as Sylhet Stadium and previously known as Sylhet Divisional Stadium, is a cricket stadium in Sylhet, Bangladesh. SICS is surrounded by hills and has a scenic view and it is the only cricket stadium having a green gallery. The stadium was significantly expanded in 2013, to host matches for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20. The stadium hosted its first international match on 17 March 2014 with Ireland taking on Zimbabwe. The stadium hosted 2022 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup.\nHistory.\nThe stadium was built in 2007, as a divisional cricket stadium. The stadium is surrounded by hills and has a scenic view. England Lions, England Under-19 and Nepal Under-19 have played here.\nThe venue hosted its first test match in November 2018, becoming the eighth test venue in Bangladesh, where the home team lost to Zimbabwe by 151 runs. The venue hosted its second test five years later, in 2023, since the first test match was played here in 2018.\nIn November–December 2023, Bangladesh played a test against New Zealand and won the match by 150 runs which was their first test win against New Zealand at home and their first test win at this venue.\nRenovation and expansion.\nThe stadium was expanded and renovated to host matches of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. The renovation began in June 2013 and ended in mid-November 2013. The main pavilion building and the media center have been constructed, floodlights have been installed, and seating arrangements were modified. Another more striking part of the stadium is the newly built, country's first 'Green gallery'.\nThe venue was again renovated in 2017 in order to upgrade the venue to an international standard stadium. A second tier was built in the east side gallery, increasing the seating capacity by 5,000 and the green hillock was remodified. As a result, the venue hosted the first leg of BPL 2017 matches.\nInternational centuries.\nShai Hope scored the first century at this ground in its inaugural ODI match when West Indies toured Bangladesh in 2018-19. Liton Das became first Bangladeshi batsman to score a century at the venue when Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh in March 2020.\nWomen's Twenty20 International centuries.\nThe following table summarises the Women's Twenty20 International centuries scored at Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.\nUnder-19 ODI centuries.\nThe following table summarises the Under-19 ODI centuries scored at Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.\nSylhet International Cricket Stadium Academy Ground.\nSylhet Outer Stadium or Sylhet International Cricket Stadium Academy Ground is a cricket ground in Sylhet, adjacent to the main stadium. Initially it was built for practice purposes for players during international matches. However, later it was developed to international standards with BCB expecting to host international matches, particularly Test matches on this ground.\nHistory.\nThe ground hosted its first international match on 1 October 2022 during the 2022 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup, with Bangladesh taking on Thailand. The venue hosted nine matches of the Women's Asia Cup, while 15 matches were hosted on the main stadium."

        "title": "Quincy Davis (basketball)",
        "text": "Quincy Spencer Davis III (; born 16 February 1983) is a Taiwanese professional basketball player who plays for the New Taipei Kings of the P. League+. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in June 2013 to naturalize in Taiwan so that he could play for the Chinese Taipei national team in international competition.\nChildhood and education.\nDavis was born in Los Angeles, California in an African American family. He graduated from McGill–Toolen Catholic High School in Mobile, Alabama in 2002 before going on to Tulane University, where he played for Tulane Green Wave men's basketball. As a freshman, in a game against the University of Southern Mississippi he matched the school record for single-game field goal percentage. In his four-year career there until 2006, he scored a total of 1,106 points, including 56 games with more than 10 points and 12 with more than 20. He collected 559 rebounds, including 226 offensive rebounds, making him one of just fourteen players in school history to achieve both a thousand points and five hundred rebounds. He also set the school record with a .577 career field goal percentage.\nEarly career.\nDavis first went overseas to play for ETHA Engomis in Cyprus in 2006. The next season, he played in Portugal. In February 2008 he signed with , a Liga Profesional de Baloncesto team in Venezuela. There, he appeared in eight games, averaging 5.5 points per game. The following year, he moved to mainland China to play in the National Basketball League. After his next season in Turkey, he came to Taiwan to join Pure-Youth Construction in the Super Basketball League. In March 2012, he won SBL's Player of the Month award for leading his team to a 6–1 record that month with an average of 20.1 points, 14 rebounds, 1.9 blocks, two assists, and 1.4 steals per game.\nDavis also became a partner in Coast To Coast Basketball, a basketball instruction institute founded in 2007 by fellow expatriate player Edward Hardy II.\nNaturalization in Taiwan.\nThe suggestion that Davis join the Chinese Taipei national team was first floated in January 2013 at the SBL 2012 MVP award ceremony. At the time, Davis stated that he was open to the idea of naturalizing as a Republic of China citizen so he could represent Taiwan in international competition. He said that of all the places in which he had played basketball, he felt happiest in Taiwan. However, naturalization would require him to renounce his U.S. citizenship, as Taiwan allows multiple citizenship only for its own citizens who have emigrated, and not for immigrants applying to become new citizens. Furthermore, as Davis did not meet the ordinary residence requirements for naturalization and his case would thus be processed by special dispensation, Taiwan sports officials also had to lobby for the support of the Ministry of the Interior. Contract length and salary negotiations introduced further delays, until in May 2013 it was announced that Davis had agreed to a US$20,000/month, two-year contract and had officially applied for naturalization.\nOn 25 June 2013, Davis went to the American Institute in Taiwan, the \"de facto\" U.S. embassy, to renounce his citizenship. The AIT processed his case much more quickly than would have been done under normal procedures, and he received his Certificate of Loss of Nationality three days later, temporarily making him a stateless person. There remained doubts whether the Ministry of the Interior could complete all the procedures relating to his naturalization by the 12 July deadline for him to register for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship, but in the end he was officially naturalized as a citizen of the Republic of China on 9 July. Taiwanese American players such as Richard Chang had previously joined the Chinese Taipei team, but Davis was the first American of another ethnic background to follow in their footsteps. Unlike most male citizens both naturalized and native-born Davis was not required to serve in the Republic of China Armed Forces because men over tall are exempt from conscription in Taiwan.\nLater career.\nDavis played with the Chinese Taipei team in an exhibition game against visiting National Basketball Association players from his former country on 29 June, scoring 25 points. He then represented the Chinese Taipei team in the 2013 William Jones Cup and in the FIBA Championship 2013, where he scored an average of 14.7 points per game. Davis led the team to second place in the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup, scoring 19 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the final game against Iran. Davis was barred from participating in the 2014 Asian Games because he had not fulfilled the residency requirements to represent Taiwan as a naturalized citizen.\nIn 2022, P. League+ announced it would reconsider its policies towards naturalized players; it was rumored that Davis would have his status in the league changed to \"foreign player\" from local, which he found shocking and later stated made him consider retirement. After a meeting was held by the board of directors, the league announced that he would continue to be treated as a local player for the 2023 season.\nIn 2023-24 season, he was suspended twice due to domestic violence charges. He was suspended for the first 20 matches of the season and was fined NT$35,000. He was found guilty on April 9, 2024 after first reading. He was then suspended for the rest of the season (including playoffs) from that day onwards.\nPersonal life.\nDavis was married to a Taiwanese national. The couple separated, then finalized their divorce in September 2022. Davis is a vegan, and opened Uncle Q, a vegan restaurant in Taipei at the end of 2019. The restaurant primarily serves American style food."

        "text": "Anthony Allen Kemp (born October 31, 1991) is an American professional baseball second baseman and left fielder in the Minnesota Twins organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics, and Baltimore Orioles.\nKemp played college baseball at Vanderbilt University. The Houston Astros selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft and he made his MLB debut with the Astros in 2016. Kemp won the 2017 World Series with the Astros. After he was traded to the Cubs during the 2019 season, Kemp played for the Athletics from 2020 through 2023 and the Orioles in 2024.\nCareer.\nAmateur career.\nKemp graduated from Centennial High School in Franklin, Tennessee. He attended Vanderbilt University, where he played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team. In 2011, Kemp was named the Southeastern Conference's (SEC) Freshman of the Year and First Team All-SEC. He was a key contributor on the 2011 team, which was the first Vanderbilt baseball team to make it to the College World Series. In 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was named an All-American and the SEC Baseball Player of the Year in 2013.\nHouston Astros.\nThe Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Double–A Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game.\nKemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, Kemp and Jake Marisnick platooned in centerfield. In 2016 with the Astros, he batted .217/.296/.325 with one home run in 136 plate appearances while playing primarily left field.\nOn March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list.\nOn September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp batted .216/.256/.243 with 4 RBIs while playing primarily left field. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title. \nIn March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick. In the 2018 season, Kemp played in 97 games for the Astros, batting .263/.351/.392 with 6 HRs and 30 RBIs, playing primarily in left field. He was mocked by the Fenway Park crowd and organist during the second game of the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS) when he took an extended period of time to return to the batter's box after a foul ball. Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch. In game four, Kemp hit a fourth inning solo home run off Rick Porcello after only hitting six homers during the regular season.\nOn July 26, 2019, the Astros designated Kemp for assignment to activate Carlos Correa. His 2019 season with the Astros ended with a .227/.308/.417 line over 163 at bats, while he had a career high with seven home runs in 66 games, prior to being traded.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn July 31, 2019, the Astros traded Kemp to the Chicago Cubs for Martín Maldonado. In 2019 with the Cubs, he batted .183/.258/.305 with one home run in 82 at bats.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn January 13, 2020, the Cubs traded Kemp to the Oakland Athletics for minor league first baseman Alfonso Rivas. In 2020 for the Athletics, Kemp slashed .247/.363/.301 with no home runs and four RBI in 49 games. After the 2020 season, Kemp and the Athletics signed a $1.05 million contract for the 2021 season, avoiding salary arbitration. In 2021, he slashed .279/.382/.418 with 8 home runs and 37 RBIs in 131 games. His hard-hit percentage of 21.9% was, however, though the highest of his career, in the bottom 2% of the league, and his barrel percentage was in the bottom 2% of the league.\nKemp agreed to a $2.25 million salary with the Athletics for the 2022 season. In 2022, he batted .235/.307/.334 in 497 at bats. He had the lowest average exit velocity of all major league batters, at 84.4 mph, and the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls, at 14.9%.\nOn January 13, 2023, Kemp signed a one-year, $3.725 million contract with the Athletics, avoiding salary arbitration. He played in 124 games for the Athletics, hitting .209/.303/.304 with 5 home runs, 27 RBI, 15 stolen bases.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn February 23, 2024, Kemp signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. He failed to win a spot on the major league roster during spring training and was released on March 19. \nKemp signed a one–year, $1 million major league contract with the Baltimore Orioles on March 26.

It was the first conference tournament held since the split of the original Big East Conference. While The American is the legal successor to the old Big East, the rights to conference tournament in Madison Square Garden were retained by the new Big East, so the 2014 tournament was numbered as the new conference's first edition. The tournament was held March 12–15 in the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee and decided a champion of the 2013–14 American Athletic Conference men's basketball season (like most NCAA conferences, The American recognizes both regular-season and tournament champions; Cincinnati and Louisville shared the regular-season title). The teams in the conference competed in a ten-team single-elimination tournament for an automatic bid to the 2014 NCAA tournament.\nIn the 2013–14 season, The American consisted of 10 members involved in the rearrangement of conferences between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. (Cincinnati, Connecticut, and South Florida) had been full members of the original Big East. One (Temple) had been a football-only Big East member before entering into full membership in The American. The remaining four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) had previously been members of Conference USA.\nSeeds.\nAll teams in the American qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded based on conference record and then a tie breaker system was used. Teams seeded 7–10 had to play in the opening round and teams seeded 1–6 received a bye to the second round. Louisville and Cincinnati finished with identical 15-3 records and shared the regular season title. Since the Cardinals and Bearcats had split their meetings during the regular season, a coin toss was held to determine the #1 seed in the tournament, which was won by Cincinnati.\nSchedule.\nAll tournament games are nationally televised on an ESPN network:"

        "text": "The 2013 FIFA Club World Cup final was the final match of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup, an association football tournament hosted by Morocco. It was the 10th final of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations as well as the host nation's league champions.\nThe final was contested between German club Bayern Munich, representing UEFA as the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, and Moroccan club Raja Casablanca, representing the host country as the reigning champions of the Botola. It was played at the Stade de Marrakech in Marrakesh on 21 December 2013.\nBackground.\nBayern Munich.\nBayern Munich qualified for the tournament as winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, following a 2–1 win against Borussia Dortmund in the final. This was Bayern Munich's first time competing in the tournament. They twice won the Intercontinental Cup, the predecessor of the FIFA Club World Cup, in 1976 and 2001. They reached the final after defeating Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in the semi-finals.\nRaja Casablanca.\nRaja Casablanca won the 2012–13 Botola to earn the host country berth of the tournament. This was Raja Casablanca's second time competing in the tournament, having participated in the competition in the inaugural edition in 2000. They were the second team to reach the final of the competition (after Corinthians in 2000) under the condition of being the host nation's national champions, as well as the second African finalist (after TP Mazembe in 2010). They reached the final after defeating New Zealand club Auckland City in the play-off round, Mexican club Monterrey in the quarter-finals, and Brazilian club Atletico Mineiro in the semi-finals.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nBayern Munich defender Dante opened the scoring in the seventh minute; after Jérôme Boateng headed Xherdan Shaqiri's corner into his path, he turned and shot past goalkeeper Khalid Askri. Thiago got the second for Bayern in the 22nd minute, when he shot right-footed into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area after a pull-back pass from the left from David Alaba. Bayern had the chance to add a third midway through the second half, but Shaqiri hit the crossbar from six yards before Thiago shot the rebound high and wide. Raja Casablanca almost got themselves back into the game late on, when Vianney Mabidé found himself onside only to shoot straight at Manuel Neuer in the Bayern goal, and captain Mouhcine Moutouali hit the rebound over the bar from just outside the goal area.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

For the first (and only) time, the competition took an elimination format: after a standard International round, consisting of 6 rounds shot at various lengths from 30m to 90m, the 15 archers with the highest cumulative score took part in a final round, shot at 30m, to decide the champion. In the women's competition, the eventual winner Ina Catani was the same as the first round winner; but in the men's, the Czechoslovak archers who had dominated the first round struggled against the host Belgian archers who were masters of the shorter distance. Adrien Van Kolen, winner of the final round, was named Champion, but Jaroslav Jenecek, who topped the first round and would have been champion under the previous format, was awarded a special 'High Total' trophy."

        "text": "The Iona Gaels Men's Ice Hockey was an NCAA Division I ice hockey team that played in the MAAC for five seasons. \nHistory.\nPrior to the founding of the MAAC hockey conference the Gales had been a Division III ice hockey program and were a part of the ECAC 3 conference from 1977 thru 1998. When the MAAC formed their hockey conference as per NCAA regulations, the three full member schools in the conference were forced into the conference. Due to the reticence of the other MAAC schools to start hockey programs, Iona, Canisius and Fairfield were joined by five associate members for the first season in 1998–99. In the five-year existence of the MAAC hockey conference Iona was a middle of the pack team, finishing between third and eighth place and playing in every postseason tournament. Iona's best finish came in the 2000 season when they defeated the top-seeded Quinnipiac Braves en route to a second-place finish in the tournament. Despite showing some promise in their program, Iona's board of trustees voted to eliminate the men's ice hockey program at the end of the 2002-03 season.\nIona's ice hockey program began in 1967 under Harry Nixon. As a Division III independent, the Gaels went undefeated in their inaugural year with a 16-0 record. Though Nixon stepped down after only one year, Bill Edwards was able to shepherd Iona to eight winning seasons over the next decade, finishing 1976-77 with a 26-5-1 mark. After eleven years as an independent, Iona joined the ECAC 3. Edwards coached the first two seasons of the Gaels as a conference member before being succeeded by Frank Effinger in 11 season as coach, Iona experienced an unprecedented level of success, never finishing below a .600 record. Bill Conforte took over after the 1989-90 season and though the Gaels ended with a 16-6-1 record his first year, that would be the end of their success for the near future. Iona has a steady decline in the 1990s, routinely finishing with losing records and eventually the firing of Conforte after a 2-20-3 season in 1996-97. Frank Bretti was hired for the 1997-98 season and after a 4-20-1 finish, Iona was set to join the Division I ranks."

Despite being a D-I school, the Stags competed in ECAC's lower classification. McCarthy retired after the 1995-96 season and was replaced by Peter LaVigne who then stepped down after only one season. Mike Doneghey succeeded Lavigne and in Doneghey's first year Fairfield was ruled ineligible to play in ECAC's North/Central/South postseason after offering athletic scholarships, a violation of D-III rules. Fairfield had offered the scholarships because they were joining the newly formed Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) ice hockey conference which was to begin play in 1998-99. In their first year as a full D-I program Fairfield finished with one of the all-time worst records, going 1-31 over the course of the season and allowed an average of more than 7 goals per game. After the worst record in team history Doneghey was promptly replaced with Mark Dennehy and, though there was improvement, Dennehy himself left after a 3-28-3 season to become an assistant at Massachusetts. Jim Hunt assumed the reins for the 2000-01 season and saw to a resurgence in Fairfield's fortunes with an 11-win season, but the next two years saw diminishing returns with 6 and 8 wins.\nHunt was not able to push the Stags any further due to the University dropping the ice hockey program to club status after the 2002-03 season. The move came as a cost-cutting measure that also claimed Fairfield's football program. In five season as a D-I school, Fairfield finished last in their conference three times, made two conference tournaments and lost both of its playoffs games by a combined score of 23-7.\nToday the Stags Men's Ice Hockey Team is a member of the ACHA and competes in the D3 division. Under new head coach Mike Silva, the team has seen an Empire Conference Championship in 2015 and three consecutive Regional Championships that vaulted the team into contention for the national title. In 2015 the team achieved a record of 0-3-0 on the national stage, yet still finished ranked 14th in the country. In 2016 the team achieved a record of 1-1-1 at nationals nearly qualifying for the semi-finals, ultimately the team finished 7th in the country that year. In 2017 the team earned a record of 1-2-0 and finished 12th in the country."

The reigning champion is Mark Allen, who won the title for the second time in 2023.\nThe Champion of Champions features winners of World Snooker events over the preceding 12 months, with the field topped up, if necessary, from the current World Rankings. In 2020, the tournament had a prize fund of £440,000, of which £150,000 went to the winner.\nHistory.\nThe event was created in 1978 by boxing promoter Mike Barrett. It was contested by four players at the Wembley Conference Centre in London, England, and was played over two days, with the semi-finals on the first day and the final on the second day. World Champion Ray Reardon beat that year's Masters winner Alex Higgins 11–9 in the final. Brief highlights were shown on ITV's \"World of Sport\" on the following afternoon. The event was not held in 1979, but appeared again in 1980 at the New London Theatre in Drury Lane, London, in a different format. Ten players competed in the tournament, split into two groups. Each group played a round robin, with the winners of the groups advancing to the final. Doug Mountjoy beat John Virgo 10–8 to become champion. The tournament was then abandoned, since the audiences had been poor and the event was financially unsuccessful.\nIt was revived in 2013 by Matchroom Sport, replacing the Premier League Snooker on the calendar. Held in November at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, and contested by 16 of the world's leading players, the event was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on ITV4. The 2013 and 2014 tournaments were won by Ronnie O'Sullivan, but he chose not to defend the title in 2015; that year, Neil Robertson defeated Mark Allen 10–5 to claim his first win in the tournament. In 2016, John Higgins beat O'Sullivan 10–7. O'Sullivan was beaten by Shaun Murphy in the 2017 final too, but he took back the trophy in 2018, defeating Kyren Wilson 10–9. Robertson also won 10–9 against Judd Trump in the 2019 final, claiming the title for the second time. The 2020 final was a repeat of the final of the 2015 edition of the event, but this time Allen defeated Robertson 10–6. In 2021, Trump won 10–4 against Higgins, but he failed to defend the title in 2022, losing 6–10 to O'Sullivan, who won the tournament for the fourth time. Trump was runner-up again in 2023, suffering a 3–10 loss this time to Mark Allen, who became the third player to be champion more than once, after O'Sullivan and Robertson.\nAs a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition was relocated to the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes, in order to create a secure bubble, the same way as all other snooker tournaments were played in that season. The 2021 edition was held in Bolton for the first time, featuring a change to the dress code, as all players had special shirts with their nickname on the back; this change was met with mixed response by the players."

Led by head coach Tim Miles, in his second season, the Cornhuskers team played its home games in the brand new Pinnacle Bank Arena in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, and were a member of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season with a record 19–13 overall, 11–7 in Big Ten play for a 4th-place finish, despite being predicted by many to finish last in the conference. They lost in the quarterfinals in the 2014 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament to Ohio State. They received at-large bid to the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first time since 1998. They lost in the first round to Baylor.\nIncoming recruits.\nTim Wagner, a 6-3 guard from Galesville, Wisconsin joined the team as a walk-on.\nEarly departures.\nJordan Tyrance.\nOn November 5, 2013, just one day after the Cornhuskers defeated in-state opponent Nebraska-Kearney in an exhibition game, walk-on Jordan Tyrance informed head coach Tim Miles that he was leaving the team due to personal reasons, stating, '\"I just had some personal things that I needed to take care of. I love the sport, I mean collegiate sports get tough, and it's a big time commitment.'\" Besides having balanced homework and practice, Tyrance was also caring for his two-year-old daughter Kyalinn. '\"I had some family I need to spend time with, a daughter, and just needed to handle my home stuff. She's my life [and] she deserves to have a father that's around, and watching her grow up.'\"\nDeverell Biggs.\nDeverell Biggs did not play and was absent from the team during their win over Minnesota on January 26, 2013. Biggs tweeted that his absence was due to \"personal reasons.\" On January 27, 2014 Head Coach Miles dismissed Biggs from the team. According to sources Biggs missed a film session on the day of the Minnesota game, but according to Miles, no single incident led to Biggs' dismissal.\nBiggs was the first in-state recruit to sign with Nebraska in 10 seasons, but faced a number of disciplinary woes prior to his dismissal. In December 2012, during Biggs' redshirt season, he was cited for DUI and leaving the scene of an accident. That led to a two-game suspension to start the 2013-2014 season. Biggs didn't make the trip to Cincinnati on December 28, 2013 for disciplinary reasons after missing a film session. Biggs was also cited Jan. 5 by University of Nebraska-Lincoln police for running a stop sign and driving on a suspended license.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nSource:"

The case primarily dealt with issues pertaining to attributes of sovereignty, treaty obligations \"qua \"internal law, and the jurisprudence related to international canals.\nBackground.\nA British steamship, the \"Wimbledon\", was time-chartered by a French company, , which was based in Paris. According to the terms of the charter, the vessel had taken on board at Salonica 4,200 tons of munitions and artillery stores consigned to the Polish naval base at Danzig. On 21 March 1921, \"Wimbledon\" arrived at the Kiel Canal, but the Director of Canal Traffic refused permission to pass through by basing his refusal upon the neutrality orders issued by Germany in connection with the Polish–Soviet War. The French Ambassador at Berlin requested the German government to withdraw the prohibition and to allow \"Wimbledon\" to pass through the Kiel Canal, in conformity with Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles. The German government replied that it would not allow a vessel with a cargo of munitions and artillery stores consigned to the Polish Military Mission at Danzig to pass through the canal, as the German Neutrality Orders prohibited the transit of cargoes of this kind destined for Poland or Russia, and Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles was not an obstacle to the application of such orders to the Kiel Canal. The telegraphed to the captain of the S.S. \"Wimbledon\", ordering him to continue his voyage by the Danish Straits. The vessel weighed anchor on 1 April and, proceeding by Skagen, reached Danzig, its port of destination on 6 April; it had been detained for eleven days, and had taken two extra days for its deviation.\nThe British, French, Italian and Japanese governments brought the action that was heard from 16 January 1923 to 17 August 1923.\nThe Court had these members:\nThe court considered Articles 380 to 386 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 2 and 7 of the Hague Convention of 1907 .\nDecision.\nThe court first had to consider Poland's application to intervene, which it allowed.\nIt then considered the substantive issue in the case and found that Germany was perfectly free to regulate its neutrality in the war. However, it found that the canal had ceased to be an internal navigable waterway of Germany. Germany thus had a definite duty of allowing the passage of the \"Wimbledon\" through the Kiel Canal, and its neutrality did not oblige the prohibition of allowing the passage.\nJudges Anzilotti, Huber and Schüking dissented."

The Tams found themselves trailing 21-11 at the end of the first quarter. The Warriors were mostly leading by double digits the entire first half until the Tams were able to claw their way back to cut the lead down to a single digit in the final 2 minute frame of the second quarter, 32-37. FEU started the second half on a 10-3 run to take advantage of the Warriors 42-40 in the first three minutes of the third quarter, only to end the momentum with Garcia committing an unsportsmanlike foul that gave the Warriors their own 7-0 surge to regain the lead 42-47. FEU scored the last six points to lead the Warriors 61-54 to end the third. FEU led as much as 15 in the fourth and went on to win the game, 89-78, their seventh straight win against the Warriors.\nADMU Blue Eagles.\nLeading by as much as 11 points in the fourth quarter, the Eagles came back with a 14-2 run to gain the lead, 58-57. FEU then scored three straight baskets for a 59-64 lead with over two minutes in the fourth but Elorde made a quick three to pull within two, 62-64. The game were tied at 66 with 10 seconds left in the game and eventually went to overtime after a Garcia miss. The Tams outscored the Eagles, 13-9 in overtime to get the win, 79-75, ending their six-game losing streak to the Eagles. Romeo scored six of the Tams' last eight points in the extra period.\nTerrence Romeo was named the first Press Corps Player of the Week of the season averaging 21 points, 5.3 assists and two steals per game in wins over UE, Ateneo and UP.\nBattle of the East, Round 2.\nThough FEU led almost the entire game with as much as 17, the Roi Sumang-led Red Warriors came back late in the fourth quarter taking advantage of FEU's lackluster defense and poor free throw shooting to tie the game at 70. The game went to overtime and the Warriors were in control in the extra period with a seven-point lead with 28 seconds in left, but was not able to cap off the win as they let the Tams score five straight points with Romeo completing a coast to coast finish and Mendoza stealing an inbound pass off of UE's Santos for a three-point marker putting the Tams within striking distance, 84-82. Sumang was fouled and missed one of his free throws with 13 seconds left, giving FEU the chance to tie the game only being down by three, 85-82. Tolomia hit the three pointer after faking a hand-off pass to Romeo and sends the game to its second overtime. The Tams showed dominance into the second overtime with a 98-94 win, snapping their two-game losing skid. The Warriors lost eight straight games to the Tamaraws."

        "title": "Pastora (baseball club)",
        "text": "There have been four different professional baseball clubs in Venezuela that have played under the name Pastora. These teams have been established in the northwest of the country, particularly in the states of Zulia and Acarigua, and have played in different leagues between 1931 and 2000.\nTeam history.\nThe Pastora team was based in the City of Maracaibo and was sponsored by a local dairy company, while adopting the name Lácteos de Pastora (Pastora Milkers). Although Zulia is a petroleum state, dairy farming is also a major industry there.\nAfter Maracaibo was founded in 1529, shepherds tended cows and goats for their milk and to make cheese and other dairy products. On one hand, \"Pastora\" is the Spanish word for shepherd; on the other hand, the patron saint of the neighbor state of Lara is \"La Divina Pastora\" (The Divine Shepherdess).\nEach January 14, her statue is typically carried on the main streets of Barquisimeto from the city of Santa Rosa, in the outskirts of Barquisimeto, until it reaches the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Barquisimeto which is about five miles away. The devotion to the \"Divina Pastora\" in Venezuela dates from 1736, when the parish priest of the town of Santa Rosa commissioned a sculptor to make a statue of the Immaculate Conception. Unexpectedly, the figure that was delivered was of the Divina Pastora.\nFirst stage.\nPastora debuted in the extinct Zulian Baseball League First Division, which was created in 1932 and folded at the end of the 1940 season. After five years of absence, the league resumed operations in 1946 and remained active until 1952.\nPastora played in all these seasons, while winning the 1934 and 1948 titles. The most successful team in this period was the Gavilanes BBC, which won 13 of the 17 tournaments played, eight with Ernesto Aparicio at the helm. In 1951, Orange Victoria won the league championship remaining.\nA storied baseball rivalry between Gavilanes and Pastora captured the fans' attention with fiery displays in every season.\nSecond stage.\nAfter that, the circuit was renamed Liga Occidental de Béisbol Profesional before joining Organized Baseball in 1953, operating continuously until 1964.\nIn 1953, the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League and the recently created LOBP agreed to have the clubs with the best records from each circuit meet in a National Championship Series called \"El Rotatorio\", the first and only in VPBL history. The Cervecería Caracas and Navegantes del Magallanes clubs represented the VPBL, while Gavilanes and Pastora represented the LOBP. The pennant was clinched by Pastora with a 48–30 record. Managed by veteran Napoleón Reyes, the champion team won easily over Magallanes (40–37), Gavilanes (34–44) and Caracas (33–44), earning the right to represent Venezuela in the 1954 Caribbean Series.\nIn the opening game of the 1954 Series, the Venezuelan squad defeated the Cuban team for the first time in Series history, 7–5, after suffering 10 consecutive loses in the past five tournaments. Nevertheless, Pastora went 1–4 to finish last in the four-team event. Among others, that Pastora roster included pitchers Ralph Beard, Tommy Byrne, Howie Fox and Ramón Monzant; catcher Ed Bailey; outfielders Wally Moon and Billy Queen, as well as infielders Camaleón García, Vernon Benson, Johnny Temple and the then-rookie Luis Aparicio, who made his first Series appearance.\nPastora returned to the Zulia circuit for the 1954–55 season, to win the first title in this stage of the league. Both leagues used a new playoffs format in the 1957–58, 1958–59 and 1960–61 seasons to determine the national team to represent Venezuela in the Caribbean Series, but, after their championship season in 1954–55, the Pastora club was out of contention until 1963–64, during what turned out to be the LOBP's final season.\nThird stage.\nMore than four decades later, a new Pastora club joined the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League as a replacement for the Petroleros de Cabimas. Renamed as Pastora de Occidente, the team was based in the city of Cabimas. Managed by Domingo Carrasquel, they finished 30-31 in 1995-96, getting knocked out by the Zulia Eagles in a tie-break game for playoff and 18-34 in 1996-97 without any chance of advancing to the playoffs in both seasons. Its only highlight came when on 21 November 1996, Doug Creek, Jose Villa and Luis Lunar pitched a combinated no-hitter against Caribes, before withdrawing at the end of that season due to poor attendance and results.\nFourth stage.\nThis time, Pastora moved to the cities of Acarigua and Araure in Portuguesa. The teams changed its name to the Pastora de los Llanos and continued to operate in the VPBL between the 1997–98 and 2006-2007 seasons. Unlike the previous teams it replaced, Pastora managed to advance to playoffs but never make it into finals. The most close they were was at the 99-2000 season after being knocked out by the Navegantes del Magallanes in a tie-break game. Despite the initial success, the team performed poorly in the next seasons, even having a worst record of 12-37 for the cancelled 2002-03 season. Following six seasons and four classifications to playoffs plaguef of failures, subsequent profit losses, lack of support and poor attendance to the stadium, the owner sold the team at the end of 2007.\nStarting the 2007-08 season, the franchise moved to Margarita Island and was renamed Bravos de Margarita. Since then, no other team named Pastora has participated in Venezuelan professional baseball.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Bath's 20-year-old back-rower Gareth Delve was a surprise selection in the original squad, but he suffered a shoulder injury against the Barbarians and was replaced in the final squad by uncapped Swansea back-rower Jonathan Thomas. The other uncapped players in the final squad were Neath prop Adam Jones, Llanelli scrum-half Mike Phillips, Swansea hooker Huw Bennett and Leeds back-rower Alix Popham. Four captains were named for the tour: flankers Colin Charvis and Martyn Williams, hooker Robin McBryde and fly-half Stephen Jones.\nMatches.\nWales vs Barbarians.\nWales prepared for their tour to Australia and New Zealand with an uncapped match against the Barbarians at the Millennium Stadium on 31 May 2003. It served as a farewell match for fly-half Neil Jenkins, who was retiring from international rugby as the all-time top point scorer in test history. The Barbarians scored eight tries during the match, taking a 48–28 lead into the closing stages; Jenkins, who had come on in the 66th minute, set up Tom Shanklin for his hat-trick try, before slotting the final points of the game himself."

The game was released on 22 November 2013 for Windows, exclusively via Steam, for a short period of time before it was removed from sale. Furthermore, on 28 November 2013 the publisher 505 Games formally announced that the game had been cancelled and that refunds were to be given to anyone who had purchased it on Steam.\nAshes 2013 featured the official licensed Australian and English cricket teams, as well as 14 unlicensed national teams. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and retail PC releases were all cancelled following the game's troubled development and brief launch on Steam.\nFeatures.\nThe game featured the complete 2013 Ashes cricket event series. It also planned for an improved fielding editor with up to 60 fielding options. There was also a plan for a new-look batting system which allows for a larger variety of shots. Weather and pitch conditions would also affect bowling styles. Match commentary is provided by Mark Nicholas, David Lloyd and Michael Slater.\nDevelopment.\nTrickstar Games was developing a new gaming system built upon the beta version of Unity Engine to provide better gameplay in batting, bowling, and fielding. The game was originally to be released on June 21, 2013, however the release date was moved back to July 2013. With a release date still not specified, there were concerns that the game would not even make the revised July release. 505 Games then confirmed the game was being further cancelled for a November 2013 release due to quality concerns, stating it is \"simply not worthy of the Ashes name\", despite the fact that the new release date missed the opening of the real-life Ashes series in Australia.\nIn that time, Mike Fegan of Trickstar Games had promised regular updates. He started a weekly video diary on the official \"Ashes Cricket 2013\" Facebook page, but the flow of updates dried up over time and information about the game ceased.\nThe game was eventually released on Steam on 22 November 2013.\nReception.\nThe game received negative reviews from critics, cricket fans and the media, and there were several videos on YouTube featuring extensive bugs. The \"Ashes Cricket 2013\" Facebook page has since been deleted, and the Twitter feed has remained inactive since July 2013.\nFour days later after its release, it was removed from sale. It was finally announced on 28 November that all production of the game had been cancelled, along with plans to release console versions of the game, and that all people who purchased the game would receive a full refund. The publisher 505 Games apologized to the game's users and turned its attention to \"protecting the Ashes name and that of the ECB and Cricket Australia\".\nIt is widely featured as one of the worst games of 2013."

In 1910/11 the club was admitted to the First Grade competition with a team also playing in B2-Grade. The home ground at the time was Midland Oval.\nIn 1914/15 Midland Junction's area took in the Swan District region and changed its name to Midland-Swan Cricket Club.\nIn 1918/19, arising from the post-war reconstruction of the club, and in deference to the many players from Guildford, the Club's name was again changed to the Midland Guildford Cricket Club. Only a B-Grade team played in the competition for this season.\nIn 1919/20 Midland Guildford entered a First Grade team in the WACA competition.\nIn October 1923, it was decided that the club colours would be black and white.\nIn September 1941, World War II was raging and due to high-pressure work programmes for military requirements in the Midland workshops, no Midland Guildford teams were nominated.\nThe club remained in abeyance until the 1946/47 season when it was reconstructed. The first game was played in October 1946.\nMidland Guildford Cricket Club has always provided a pathway for individuals to develop their game and to aspire to state and international selection. A number of players have attained these goals. The club has further developed overseas players who have gone on to represent their own countries.\nIn the 1981/82 season, the club moved its home ground from Midland Oval to the picturesque Lilac Hill Park ground in Caversham.\nOver the years Midland Guildford Cricket Club has had many successes – the most memorable being the 19-years during which it hosted the Lilac Hill Festival Matches against visiting overseas teams.\nThe club has a good working relationship with the WACA and now fields four senior men's teams, four junior teams and two female teams."

Out of the divide the World Aquachallenge Association (WAA) - an alternative governing body - was born.\nIn 2007 CMAS intended to incorporate the Underwater Hockey World Championship into its inaugural World Games event in Bari, Italy, an ambitious event intended to showcase all of the underwater disciplines (Underwater Rugby, Finswimming etc) governed by them in one place. As far as underwater hockey goes this event was poorly attended, in part due to it being 'out of synch' with many affiliated federations' training calendars and budgets. The following year - the 'normal' world championship year - the WAA organised their 'rival' 1st World Championship event in Durban, South Africa. This is now held by many to have been the official 2008 World Championship despite it being poorly attended too, in part this time because CMAS organised a major underwater hockey 'zone' event to be held in Istanbul, Turkey on exactly the same dates meaning a majority of European federations were forced to choose which championship their representative teams attended.\nThe WAA was short-lived and since 2008 CMAS has once again administered all the world championship events in various age/gender divisions with the most recent having been held in Quebec City, Canada in 2018.

Davis was making his seventh and final overseas tour with the Wallabies, his third as captain. Howell writes that for Davis at 33 years and the end of a magnificent career, the seven loss &amp; five win result of the tour was \"a disaster and occasioned Davis' retirement\". An injury picked up in New Zealand prevented Davis from leading the side in the Test match in Fiji on the way home. Peter Sullivan led the Wallabies to a narrow 21-19 victory against Fiji.

They began on April 16, 2014, and ended June 13, 2014, when the Los Angeles Kings defeated the New York Rangers four games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Boston Bruins made the playoffs as Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Detroit Red Wings increased their consecutive playoff appearance streak to 23 seasons, the longest streak at the time and the fifth-longest streak in NHL history. The Dallas Stars ended the league's third longest active playoff appearance drought, qualifying for the postseason for the first time in six years. For the first time since 1973, only one Canadian team qualified for the playoffs: the Montreal Canadiens. This was also the first time since the 1978 Stanley Cup playoffs that no playoff games were played in Western Canada. For the third time in four years, all three California-based teams again made the playoffs. The Columbus Blue Jackets won their first franchise playoff game on April 19, 2014, and their first-ever franchise playoff home game at Nationwide Arena on April 23, 2014, both against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Three Original Six teams reached the conference finals, the first time this has occurred since 1979.\nThe first round featured leads changing hands more so than any previous year. After the Anaheim Ducks rallied from a 4–2 deficit to defeat the Dallas Stars in game six of their first-round series on April 27, 2014, an NHL record was broken for most multi-goal comebacks by all teams in the opening round, with ten. In all four rounds combined in the previous year's playoffs, there were only eight such victories. The San Jose Sharks became the fourth team in Stanley Cup playoff history to lose a series after holding a 3–0 lead; as the Los Angeles Kings came back to win the series in game seven of the first round on April 30, 2014.\nOn May 29, 2014, the Rangers became the first team to ever advance past the conference finals after playing two seven-game series in the opening two rounds. The Rangers also became the first captainless team to reach the finals since the Chicago Black Hawks in 1973. That same seven-game mark was eclipsed on June 1, 2014, as the Kings became the first team to ever reach the Stanley Cup Finals after having played three consecutive seven-game series. Los Angeles played all three of their game sevens on the road. Game five of the Stanley Cup Finals marked the 93rd game of the 2014 playoffs, eclipsing the previous single-year record 92 established in 1991; this remains the record for the most games played using a sixteen team playoff format. The record for most games played in a single year was broken during the expanded 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nThe Kings tied the 1987 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2004 Calgary Flames, for most games played (26) in one playoff year under a four-round playoff format (later matched by the 2015 Tampa Bay Lightning and 2019 St. Louis Blues). The record was subsequently broken by the 2020 Dallas Stars during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe NHL adopted a new league alignment for the 2013–14 season, as the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were moved to the Eastern Conference and the Winnipeg Jets to the Western Conference. The 16-team Eastern Conference was then divided into two 8-team divisions (Metropolitan and Atlantic), while the 14-team Western Conference was divided into two 7-team divisions (Pacific and Central). As part of the realignment, the NHL also switched its former conference-based playoff structure to a divisional-based playoff structure. The top three teams from each division qualified for that conference's playoffs. The remaining two playoff spots in each conference were wild card teams, which were the top two clubs from each conference that failed to win a divisional playoff spot.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home-ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the first round, the lower-seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other two teams from each division played each other in the other series, with the second-placed team having home-ice advantage. In the first two rounds, home-ice advantage was awarded to the team with the higher seed; in the last two rounds, it was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Beginning in 2013–14, the NHL officially changed the names of the first two rounds of the playoffs from \"Conference Quarterfinal/Semifinal\" to \"First/Second Round.\"\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (WC2) Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Boston Bruins won the Presidents' Trophy earning the league's best record, with 117 points. The Detroit Red Wings earned 93 points during the regular season, losing the tiebreaker to Columbus in regulation + overtime wins (38 to 34), and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference's second wild card. This was the eighth playoff meeting for these Original Six teams, with Boston having won four of the seven previous series. They last met in the 1957 Stanley Cup Semifinals, which Boston won in five games. The Red Wings won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Bruins eliminated the Red Wings in five games. In game one, Pavel Datsyuk scored the only goal with 3:01 left in Detroit's 1–0 victory, but Boston went on to win four straight contests to capture the series. Four different Bruins players scored goals in Boston's 4–1 win in game two. Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask then stopped all 23 Detroit shots in a 3–0 victory in game three. In game four, Boston overcame a two-goal, second-period deficit, scoring three unanswered goals – including Jarome Iginla's game-winner at 13:32 of overtime to win 3–2. The Bruins clinched the series with a 4–2 win in game five, as Torey Krug recorded two assists, and Rask made 31 saves on 33 shots.\n(A2) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (A3) Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning finished second overall in the Atlantic Division, earning 101 points. The Montreal Canadiens earned 100 points during the regular season, to finish third overall in the Atlantic Division. This was the second playoff meeting for these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 2004 Eastern Conference semifinals, in which Tampa Bay swept Montreal out of the playoffs en route to their Stanley Cup victory. The Lightning won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Canadiens swept the Lightning, who were without their starting goalie Ben Bishop after he suffered an injury during the last few weeks of the regular season. With Anders Lindback in the Tampa Bay net, Steven Stamkos of the Lightning scored at 13:27 of the third period to tie game one, 4–4, before Montreal's Dale Weise won it at 18:08 of overtime. Rene Bourque scored two goals, and Carey Price stopped 26 out of 27 shots, in the Canadiens' 4–1 win in game two. At 15:38 of the second period of game three, Tampa Bay's Ryan Callahan appeared to give his team a 2–1 lead, but his goal was waved off as the officials ruled that there was contact between Alex Killorn and Price; Montreal's Brendan Gallagher then scored minutes later, and the Canadiens went on to win 3–2. Max Pacioretty then scored a power-play goal at 19:17 of the third period of game four to give Montreal the 4–3 win and the series.\n(M1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (WC1) Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins finished first in the Metropolitan Division, earning 109 points. The Columbus Blue Jackets earned 93 points during the regular season, and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference's first wild card, winning the tiebreaker over Detroit in regulation + overtime wins (38 to 34), making the post-season for the first time since 2009, and only the second time in the franchise's history. This was the first playoff meeting for these two teams. The Penguins won all five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blue Jackets recorded their first-ever playoff victories in team history, but the Penguins still managed to win the series in six games. The first five games in the series featured comebacks, including 3–1 leads evaporating into 4–3 losses in the first four games. In game one, Pittsburgh scored three unanswered goals, including Brandon Sutter's game winner 8:18 in the third period, to overcome a two-goal deficit to win, 4–3. Columbus then overcame a two-goal deficit in game two after Pittsburgh built their lead with Brian Gibbons scoring his first two playoff goals, including a short-handed one. Matt Calvert then scored both a short-handed goal and then the game-winner 1:10 into double overtime to give the Blue Jackets their first playoff victory in franchise history. Game three saw Brooks Orpik score his second ever playoff goal with less than two seconds remaining in the second period. The Blue Jackets would jump back up to a two-goal lead at the start of the third period, thanks to Cam Atkinson's first-ever playoff goal. But the Penguins scored three goals in a span of 2:13 in the third period, including Jussi Jokinen's game-winner at 8:06, for another 4–3 win. The Blue Jackets then overcame a three-goal deficit in game four to record a fourth 4–3 contest in this series, with Brandon Dubinsky tying the game with 24 seconds left in regulation after Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury mishandled the puck from behind his own net, allowing Ryan Johansen to fling the puck to a wide open Dubinsky. Nick Foligno then scored the game-winner at 2:49 into overtime, which gave the Blue Jackets their first home playoff victory in team history. But Fleury rebounded in game five, making 23 saves out of 24 shots in Pittsburgh's 3–1 win. Columbus lost despite spectacular play by Sergei Bobrovsky, who stopped 48 of 50 shots but did not receive the goal support needed to win. In game six, Evgeni Malkin's second career playoff hat trick helped the Penguins build a 4–0 lead, but they had to withstand a late comeback attempt by the Blue Jackets, who scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes late in the third period, to hold on to the 4–3 victory.\n(M2) New York Rangers vs. (M3) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThe New York Rangers finished second overall in the Metropolitan Division, earning 96 points. The Philadelphia Flyers earned 94 points during the regular season, to finish third overall in the Metropolitan Division. This was the 11th playoff meeting for these rivals, with Philadelphia having won six of the ten previous series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1997 Eastern Conference Final, which Philadelphia won in five games. Each team won two games in this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Rangers eliminated the Flyers in seven games. New York scored two power play goals, and Brad Richards recorded a goal and two assists, in a 4–1 victory in game one. The Flyers overcame a two-goal deficit, scoring four unanswered goals from four different players to win game two, 4–2. In game three, Daniel Girardi and Martin St. Louis each had a goal and an assist as they led the Rangers to another 4–1 win. Steve Mason then replaced Ray Emery as the starting goalie for the Flyers in game four. Mason went on to make 37 saves out of 38 shots, and Jakub Voracek scored the game-winning goal on a power play in the second period, as Philadelphia won, 2–1. However, Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist made 23 saves out of 25 shots en route to a 4–2 Rangers win in game five. Back at home in game six, Wayne Simmonds recorded a hat-trick, leading Philadelphia to a 5–2 win. Game seven was played the next night, where the Rangers jumped to a 2–0 lead in the second period, and with Henrik Lundqvist stopping 26 out of 27 shots, the Rangers hung on for a 2–1 win. The Rangers became the only NHL team to remain undefeated in a home game seven with a 6–0 franchise record.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (WC1) Minnesota Wild.\nThe Colorado Avalanche finished first overall in the Central Division, earning 112 points. The Minnesota Wild earned 98 points during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's first wild card. This was the third playoff meeting for these two teams; the Wild earned a seven-game series victory in the 2003 Western Conference quarterfinals, while the Avalanche earned a six-game series victory in the 2008 Western Conference quarterfinals. The Avalanche won four of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Wild defeated the Avalanche in seven games. The home team had won the first six games in the series before Minnesota won game seven on the road. Throughout the series, Colorado head coach Patrick Roy used his strategy of pulling goalie Semyon Varlamov for an extra attacker earlier than usual when trailing late in the third period. In game one trailing by a goal, Roy pulled Varlamov with 3:01 remaining in regulation. Paul Stastny then tied the game with 13.4 seconds remaining and then scored the game-winner 7:27 into overtime to give the Avalanche a 5–4 win. Gabriel Landeskog then scored two goals in game two to lead Colorado to a 4–2 victory. In game three, Mikael Granlund scored the only goal 5:08 into overtime in Minnesota's 1–0 victory. The Wild then only allowed 12 Colorado shots in a 2–1 win in game four, even after Roy pulled Varlamov for the extra attacker with less than three minutes left. In game five (after Roy pulled Varlamov with 2:22 left in the third period), Colorado's P. A. Parenteau's game-tying goal with 1:14 remaining was met with controversy as the Avalanche appeared to have been offside on the play, but it was never called. Nathan MacKinnon then scored 3:27 into overtime to give the Avalanche a 4–3 win. Zach Parise scored two goals in game six, including the game-winner 13:31 into the third period that broke a 2–2 tie. This time, Roy's tactic of pulling Varlamov early backfired as the Wild scored two empty net goals to win, 5–2. In game seven, Minnesota's Jared Spurgeon tied the game, 4–4, at 17:33 in the third period, and Nino Niederreiter scored the series-winning goal 5:02 into overtime to give the Wild a 5–4 win.\n(C2) St. Louis Blues vs. (C3) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThe St. Louis Blues finished second overall in the Central Division, earning 111 points. The Chicago Blackhawks earned 107 points during the regular season, to finish third overall in the Central Division. This was the eleventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with Chicago having won seven of the ten previous series. Their most recent meeting was in the 2002 Western Conference quarterfinals, which St. Louis won in five games. The Blues won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThis was the second consecutive year in which St. Louis faced the defending Stanley Cup champions in the first round. Much like last year, the Blues would win the first two games at Scottrade Center, but then go on to lose the next four games. In game one, the Blues' Jaden Schwartz scored his first career playoff goal with 1:45 left in regulation to tie the score at 3–3, then Alexander Steen won it at 26 seconds into triple-overtime. In game two, the Blackhawks held a 3–2 lead in the third period, but with less than 5 minutes left in regulation Chicago's Brent Seabrook was called for a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct (and later given a three-game suspension) for charging David Backes. Vladimir Tarasenko then tied the game on the ensuing power play, followed by Barret Jackman scoring the game-winner at 5:50 of overtime to give St. Louis a 4–3 win. Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford then stopped all 34 Blues shots to help give Chicago a 2–0 victory in game three. In game four, Patrick Kane scored two of the Blackhawks' goals in a 4–3 win, including the game-winner at 11:17 of overtime in which he took a pass in the defensive zone and then raced up ice to score from a shot from the left circle. Jonathan Toews gave Chicago a 3–2 win in game five, scoring on a breakaway at 7:36 of overtime. The Blackhawks then clinched the series with a 5–1 victory in game six, scoring 4 unanswered goals in the third period.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (WC2) Dallas Stars.\nThe Anaheim Ducks finished first overall in the Pacific Division, earning 116 points. The Dallas Stars earned 91 points during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second wild card. This was the third playoff meeting for these two franchises; the Mighty Ducks earned a six-game series victory in the 2003 Western Conference semifinals, while the Stars earned a six-game series victory in the 2008 Western Conference quarterfinals. The Stars won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Ducks defeated the Stars in six games, with the home team winning the first five games. Anaheim head coach Bruce Boudreau decided to start the series with Frederik Andersen in net, who was the hotter goalie going into the postseason, rather than original Ducks starter Jonas Hiller. Anaheim jumped to a 4–0 lead in game one but had to hold off a Dallas comeback in a 4–3 win. The Ducks scored three unanswered goals in game two, but had to hold off another Stars comeback to preserve a 3–2 victory. The series moved to Dallas for game three, where Stars goaltender Kari Lehtonen stopped all 37 Anaheim shots to earn his first playoff victory in a 3–0 win. Dallas then evened the series with a 4–2 victory in game four, scoring 4 unanswered goals to overcome a two-goal deficit. Returning to Anaheim for game five, the Ducks scored three unanswered goals in the third period to pull away for a 6–2 victory. Back in Dallas for game six, the Stars built a 4–2 lead in the second period before Boudreau decided to replace Andersen with Hiller. Anaheim then staged a comeback, first with Nick Bonino's goal with 2:10 remaining in regulation, and then Devante Smith-Pelly's score with 24 seconds left to tie the game and force overtime. Both of these goals occurred with the goalie pulled to give the Ducks an extra attacker. Bonino then scored at 2:47 into the extra period to give the Ducks a 5–4 win; it was the only game in the series won by the road team.\n(P2) San Jose Sharks vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThe San Jose Sharks finished second overall in the Pacific Division, earning 111 points. The Los Angeles Kings earned 100 points during the regular season, to finish third overall in the Pacific Division. This was the third playoff meeting between these two teams; the Sharks earned a six-game series victory in the 2011 Western Conference quarterfinals, while the Kings earned a seven-game series victory in the 2013 Western Conference semifinals. The Kings won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Kings became just the fourth team in NHL playoff history (after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders, and the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers) to come back from a 3–0 deficit to win a series 4–3. The Sharks controlled the first two games in the series, winning 6–3 and 7–2 in game one and game two, respectively, scoring 12 total goals on Kings goalie Jonathan Quick and an empty netter. In game three, Patrick Marleau scored at 6:20 into overtime to give San Jose a 4–3 victory. However, in game four Justin Williams scored two goals to lead Los Angeles to a 6–3 win. At San Jose for game five, Quick posted a shutout, as he stopped all 30 San Jose shots. In game six, San Jose head coach Todd McLellan started goalie Alex Stalock instead of Antti Niemi. Williams' game-winning goal (his second of the game) at 11:56 into the third period of game six to break a 1–1 tie was met with controversy. Stalock attempted to control a loose puck in his crease, but Williams managed to poke it through Stalock's legs across the goal line. It appeared that Williams pushed Stalock backwards during the play, and the puck seemed to disappear out of sight under the goalie's pads before Williams poked at it. The play went to video review but the call of goal on the ice stood. The Kings' Anze Kopitar then scored two more unanswered goals in a 4–1 victory. Niemi was reinstated as the Sharks starter for game seven, but the Kings scored 5 unanswered goals, and killed all six San Jose power plays, to win the game 5–1. Mike Richards and Jeff Carter, who both played for the Flyers in 2010, became the first players in NHL history to be part of two teams that won the final four games of a series, after initially facing a 3–0 series deficit.\nSecond round.\nEastern Conference second round.\n(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Montreal Canadiens.\nOne of the greatest rivalries in North American professional sports, this was the 34th meeting between these teams in the postseason, which is the most frequent playoff series in NHL history. Coming into the series, Montreal owned a record of 24–9 against Boston in the 33 previous series played by the teams, and had won 18 straight between 1946 and 1987. However, the Bruins had won the two most recent series between these two teams, the last of which was a seven-game Boston victory in the 2011 Eastern Conference quarterfinals. The Canadiens won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Canadiens eliminated the Bruins in seven games. P. K. Subban scored 4:17 into the second overtime to give Montreal a 4–3 victory in game one. In game two, the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period to overcome a two-goal deficit to win 5–3. In game three, the Canadiens built a 3–0 lead, as Subban and Dale Weise each had a goal and an assist, en route to a 4–2 win. Matt Fraser then scored the only goal in game four at 1:19 into overtime in Boston's 1–0 victory. In game five, Reilly Smith and Jarome Iginla scored two power play goals 32 seconds apart in the second period to help give the Bruins a 4–2 win. However, Carey Price stopped all 26 Boston shots, and Thomas Vanek scored two goals, helping to give Montreal a 4–0 win in game six. In Boston for game seven, Montreal defeated the Bruins 3–1, as Price made 29 saves.\n(M1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (M2) New York Rangers.\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting for these two teams, with Pittsburgh winning all four previous playoff series. Their most recent meeting was in the 2008 Eastern Conference semifinals, which Pittsburgh won in five games. Each team won two games in this year's four-game regular season series.\nFor the first time in their team history, the Rangers overcame a 3–1 game deficit to win a seven-game series. The team who scored first won the game for all seven contests in the series. Much was made early on about scheduling, as the Rangers played five games in seven days, due to going to seven games in the first round and scheduling conflicts at Madison Square Garden. They were the first team to have such a playoff schedule in 25 years, and early on it looked like the schedule might adversely affect the Rangers' chances, noted by many including Rangers coach Alain Vigneault. Derick Brassard scored 3:06 into overtime to give New York a 3–2 victory in game one. Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury then recorded two consecutive shutouts, stopping all 22 shots in a 3–0 win in game two and 35 shots in a 2–0 victory in game three. Fleury's back-to-back shutouts on back-to-back calendar days was the first time this was ever achieved in franchise history. It was also the first time the Rangers were shut out in back-to-back playoff games since 1937. Pittsburgh also took in game four, 4–2, as Evgeni Malkin had a goal and an assist, and Sidney Crosby recorded two assists. Between games four and five, Rangers forward Martin St. Louis received the news that his mother unexpectedly died at the age of 63 due to a heart attack. Despite being in mourning, St. Louis remained in the lineup, and the emotional spark that it provided turned New York around. The Rangers began their comeback with a 5–1 win in game five, as Brassard scored two of New York's goals and Mats Zuccarello recorded three assists. New York then recorded a 3–1 victory in game six, with three different players scoring goals. Finally, Brad Richards's power play goal 7:56 into the second period proved to be the difference in the Rangers' 2–1 victory in game seven.\nWestern Conference second round.\n(C3) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (WC1) Minnesota Wild.\nThis was the second playoff meeting for these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 2013 Western Conference quarterfinals, which Chicago won in five games. The Wild won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blackhawks eliminated the Wild in six games, with the home team winning the first five games. Patrick Kane scored two goals to help give Chicago a 5–2 victory in game one. In game two, Bryan Bickell had a goal and two assists in Chicago's 4–1 win. The Wild won game three, 4–0, scoring four goals in the third period and limiting Chicago to only 19 shots on goal. Four different Minnesota players then recorded goals in the Wild's 4–2 victory in game four. In game five, Jonathan Toews scored the game-winning goal at 4:33 into the third period to break a 1–1 tie, and thus give the Blackhawks a 2–1 win. Game six in Minnesota went into overtime, where Kane scored the winning goal after the puck deflected off the glass behind the Wild net and then rolled into the slot, allowing him to take a shot just under the Minnesota crossbar.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pacific Division and crosstown rivals. The Ducks won four of the five games in this year's regular season series, including a 3–0 win at the NHL's inaugural Stadium Series game held at Dodger Stadium.\nThe Kings eliminated the Ducks in seven games. The first four games in the series were won by the visiting team. Anaheim head coach Bruce Boudreau started game one with Jonas Hiller in net. However, Marian Gaborik tied the game with about seven seconds remaining in regulation, then scored the game-winner 12:17 into overtime to give Los Angeles a 3–2 win. The Kings also won game two, 3–1, as goalie Jonathan Quick only allowed one power play goal out of 37 shots. Boudreau then named Frederik Andersen as his starting goalie for game three. Andersen made 22 saves out of 23 shots before leaving in the third period due to a lower-body injury. Hiller went into the game as Andersen's replacement and made 7 saves out of 8 shots to help preserve a 3–2 victory for the Ducks. With Anaheim's starting goaltender situation still in flux, Boudreau decided to turn to rookie John Gibson for game four. The 20-year-old Gibson then became the youngest goalie in NHL history to record a shutout in his playoff debut, making 28 saves to give Anaheim a 2–0 win. Gibson followed up his performance by recording 39 saves out of 42 shots, and Devante Smith-Pelly scored two goals, to help give the Ducks a 4–3 win in game five. However, the Kings built a 2–0 second-period lead in game six en route to a 2–1 win. Los Angeles then controlled most of game seven, building a 4–0 second-period lead before Boudreau opted to replace Gibson with Hiller. The Kings then scored another goal against Hiller to make it 5–0 and held to win, 6–2, to advance to the conference finals.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(A3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (M2) New York Rangers.\nThis was the 15th playoff meeting for these two Original Six teams, with each team having won 7 of the 14 previous playoff series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1996 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which the Rangers won in six games. Montreal most recently made it to the conference finals in 2010, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, while the Rangers made it to the conference finals in 2012, losing in six games to the New Jersey Devils. Montreal won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nNew York defeated Montreal in six games. With the Rangers holding a 2–1 lead midway through the second period of game one, New York's Chris Kreider collided with Carey Price, injuring the Montreal goaltender's knee. Although Price finished the rest of the period, he did not return for the rest of the series. Peter Budaj played for the rest of the game but the Rangers won 7–2. Canadiens head coach Michel Therrien started rookie goaltender Dustin Tokarski in game two. However Henrik Lundqvist stopped 40 of 41 shots, helping New York to a 3–1 victory.\nEarly in the first period of game three, Montreal's Brandon Prust leveled Derek Stepan but the referees missed the interference call; the league would later suspend Prust two games. Later in the first period, Daniel Carcillo was penalized for charging into Prust from behind. As linesman Scott Driscoll attempted to escort Carcillo to the penalty box, Carcillo physically attempted to get away from Driscoll, leading to an automatic game misconduct and multi-game suspension. Meanwhile, the last three goals of the game were scored on rebounds and deflections. At 16:58 of the third period, Daniel Briere's shot deflected off of the Rangers's Ryan McDonagh's skate and into the net to give the Canadiens a 2–1 lead. New York then tied the game at 19:31 of the third period after Daniel Girardi's shot deflected of off Chris Kreider and bounced off of Montreal's Alexei Emelin's skate into the net. And finally, 72 seconds into overtime, Tomas Plekanec's shot deflected off of Alex Galchenyuk into the New York net to give the Canadiens the 3–2 win.\nThe Rangers won game four, 3–2, as Martin St. Louis scored 6:02 into overtime. The Canadiens then bounced back in game five, winning 7–4, as they scored 4 goals out of their first 18 shots, and Rene Bourque recorded a hat-trick. However, Dominic Moore scored game six's only goal late in the second period and with a 1–0 win the Rangers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in twenty years.\nWestern Conference final.\n(C3) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two franchises, with Chicago having won both of their previous playoff meetings. This was a rematch of the previous year's Western Conference Final, which Chicago won in five games. This was the third straight Conference finals appearance for the Kings, while it was Chicago's fourth trip to the conference finals since 2009. Chicago won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Kings eliminated the Blackhawks in seven games. Chicago took game one, 3–1, as Brandon Saad recorded a goal and assist, and Corey Crawford made 26 saves. In game two, the Kings scored six unanswered goals, including a hat-trick from Jeff Carter, to come back from a 2–0 deficit to win 6–2. Jonathan Toews scored two goals in the first period of game three to give the Blackhawks a 2–1 lead after twenty minutes, but Los Angeles's second line of Carter, Tyler Toffoli, and Tanner Pearson created two second period goals and the Kings won 4–3. The Kings also dominated game four, building a 4–0 lead in the second period en route to a 5–2 victory. Although the Kings rallied to tie game five after falling behind 3–1 in the first period, Michal Handzus scored at 2:04 of double overtime to give the Blackhawks a 5–4 victory. Drew Doughty and Patrick Kane both had a goal and an assist in the third period of a back-and-forth game six, which the Blackhawks won 4–3. The Blackhawks scored the first two goals of game seven. The Kings cut the lead in half with a controversial goal when Kings forward, Jeff Carter, appeared to be offside. The Kings briefly tied the game on a goal by Justin Williams, only to have the Blackhawks regain a 4–3 lead after two Patrick Sharp goals. But Marian Gaborik converted Dustin Brown's rebound to tie the game in the third period, and at 5:47 of overtime Alec Martinez's wrist shot from the blue line deflected past Crawford to give the Kings a 5–4 victory and a spot in the Stanley Cup Finals, for the second time in three years.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the third playoff meeting for these two teams, with the Rangers having won both previous series. They last met in the 1981 Preliminary Round, a best-of-five series which the Rangers won 3–1. This was the first major professional sports championship final between New York City and Los Angeles since the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the 1981 World Series in a strike-shortened season.\nWhile the Kings won their franchise's first Stanley Cup in , the Rangers had not won a Stanley Cup since . The Kings and Rangers split this year's two-game regular season series. This was the third Finals appearance for the Kings, while the Rangers made their eleventh Finals appearance. This was the first time a Norwegian player appeared in the Finals (Mats Zuccarello of the New York Rangers).\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltending.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average (GAA) and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

This season marked the final playoffs broadcast by TSN and RDS, as Rogers Media, Sportsnet and TVA took over national broadcast rights to the NHL beginning in the 2014–15 season (although CBC went on to air Rogers-produced coverage of the playoffs and finals). Due to scheduling conflicts with a Toronto Raptors NBA playoff game on TSN, game three of the Rangers–Flyers first-round series on April 22 was moved to Sportsnet 360—a sister network of the future rightsholder, and joined in progress by TSN following the game.\nIn the United States, all playoff games were nationally televised by either NBCSN, CNBC, NHL Network, or NBC. During the first round, these telecasts co-existed with those of regional rightsholders, after which NBC had exclusive rights to the remaining games."

        "title": "2014 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2014 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) season, and the culmination of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs. The League realigned its divisions prior to the season, and changed the structure of the playoffs, but the championship series remained the same. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Kings defeated the Eastern Conference champion New York Rangers four games to one to win their second championship in franchise history, marking the first time since that the championship series was determined in fewer than six games. Their Stanley Cup–winning run of 26 playoff games was later tied by the 2019 St. Louis Blues for the longest of any Stanley Cup–winning team in history.\nLos Angeles had home ice advantage in the series, as the Kings finished with a better regular season record than the Rangers. The series started on June 4 and ended on June 13 with the Kings winning their second Stanley Cup in three seasons. It was the first meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship since the Yankees and the Dodgers played in the 1981 World Series. Coincidentally, 1981 was also the last time the Rangers and the Kings had met in the postseason; that was the last season where the league did not use a geographical based playoff format and as a result any two teams could meet in any round of the postseason regardless of geography. In 1981 the Rangers eliminated the Kings during the first round of the playoffs.\nPaths to the Finals.\nNew York Rangers.\nThis was New York's 11th appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, and they were seeking their fifth Cup championship overall and their first one since , 20 years earlier. Since their win in 1994, their only other post-season highlights were reaching the Conference Finals in 1997 and 2012.\nThe Rangers entered the season after essentially swapping head coaches with the Vancouver Canucks: the Rangers and the Canucks fired John Tortorella and Alain Vigneault, respectively, and then coincidentally hired the other's former coach. While Vancouver, under Tortorella's first year, failed to make the playoffs, Vigneault guided New York to 96 regular season points and second place in the new Metropolitan Division. En route, the Rangers made a major trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 5, acquiring Tampa Bay's captain Martin St. Louis in exchange for their own captain Ryan Callahan. The transaction happened as Callahan and the Rangers were not close to terms on a new contract, while St. Louis was unhappy at his initial omission from the Olympics by Steve Yzerman (general manager of both the Lightning and Team Canada).\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers eliminated the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games. Then, in the second round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, New York overcame a 3–1 game deficit to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Rangers defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to capture their first Eastern Conference championship in 20 years. In the process, the Rangers became the first team ever to play two full seven-game series in the first two rounds of the playoffs and reach the Stanley Cup Finals, a feat later matched and exceeded in the same postseason by the Kings.\nDue to trading away captain Ryan Callahan and not naming a successor for the remainder of the season, Rangers were the first team since the 1972–73 Chicago Black Hawks to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals without a captain.\nBy reaching the Finals with the Rangers, Mats Zuccarello made history when he became the first Norwegian to play in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nLos Angeles made their third appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals and sought to capture their second Cup championship after winning it in .\nMuch of the core from the Kings' 2012 championship remained on the team. Los Angeles made a late regular season trade on March 5, acquiring former Ranger Marian Gaborik from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Matt Frattin and two draft picks. The Kings then finished the regular season in third place in the Pacific Division with 100 points.\nThe Finals were the only series in the 2014 playoffs in which the Kings had home ice advantage. Los Angeles needed three consecutive game sevens to advance to the Cup Finals (breaking the aforementioned Rangers' game sevens record just a couple of days later), winning all of them on the road. The team became the fourth team in NHL playoff history to win a seven-game series after losing the first three games, defeating the San Jose Sharks in the first round. The Kings eliminated their local rival Anaheim Ducks next, despite squandering a 2–0 series lead and then facing a 3–2 series deficit. In a rematch of the 2013 Western Conference Final, the Kings defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Final who had forced a seventh game after trailing the series 3–1.\nLike their 2012 championship series, the Kings' 2014 Cup Finals was marked by a 3–0 series start of winning the first two games in overtime and the third as a shutout. With their 2014 Stanley Cup win, the Kings have the distinction of winning the first championship after the League's realignment as well as becoming the first team in the salary-cap era to win two championships in the span of three years or less. Their 2012 championship made them also the final team to win the Cup in the League's last full season before the realignment, as the 2012–13 season was shortened by a lockout. The Kings played a record 26 playoff games to win the Stanley Cup, the most ever for a champion (the St. Louis Blues matched this feat in 2019).\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe Kings overcame a two-goal deficit to defeat the Rangers 3–2 in the first game. New York built their 2–0 lead in the first period by scoring 1:42 apart. Benoit Pouliot scored first on a breakaway after stealing the puck from Drew Doughty, then shooting past Jonathan Quick. Carl Hagelin then recorded a short-handed goal, as his shot was initially blocked by Quick but then rebounded off of Slava Voynov's skate into the net. The Kings' comeback began with Kyle Clifford's goal late in the first period. Clifford shot it in from near the left post after receiving a pass from Jeff Carter. Doughty tied the game in the second period, beating Henrik Lundqvist from the left circle. In the third period, the Kings outshot the Rangers, 20–3, but neither Lundqvist nor Quick allowed any goals. In the final minute of regulation, Quick stopped Hagelin's shot on a breakaway, and seconds later Lundqvist barely kept Carter's wrap-around shot from crossing the goal line. In overtime, Daniel Girardi turned over the puck in the New York zone, leading Mike Richards to pass the puck to Justin Williams, who then put the puck over Lundqvist to win the game.\nGame two.\nThe Kings overcame three two-goal deficits to defeat the Rangers 5–4 in double overtime. Including their game seven victory in the Western Conference Final against the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles became the first team in Stanley Cup playoffs history to overcome three consecutive two-goal deficits. With the first game also going to overtime, it marked the third consecutive year that the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals went to overtime. Ryan McDonagh and Mats Zuccarello scored in the first period to give the Rangers a 2–0 lead. Jarret Stoll then cut New York's lead in half at 1:46 of the second period. The teams then traded power play goals with Martin St. Louis scoring for the Rangers and Willie Mitchell for the Kings. Eleven seconds after Mitchell's goal, Derick Brassard gave New York a 4–2 lead after miscommunication between Mitchell and Jonathan Quick behind the Kings net lead to a turnover. Dwight King's goal to cut the Rangers' lead to 4–3 early in the third period was controversial. King and McDonagh were fighting for position in front of Henrik Lundqvist when Matt Greene shot the puck from the right point. King made contact with Lundqvist in the crease as he touched the puck before it went into the net but no goaltender interference was called: the referee ruled that the contact occurred after the puck already sailed past Lundqvist. Marian Gaborik then tied the game with an unassisted goal at 7:36 of the third during a scramble in front of the New York net. At 10:26 of double overtime, Dustin Brown deflected Mitchell's shot from the left point into the net to give the Kings the 5–4 win. This gave the Kings a 2–0 series lead as the series shifted to New York City, despite never leading in either game during regulation time in Los Angeles.\nGame three.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup Finals game played in the state of New York since Game 6 of the 1999 Finals in Buffalo. The Kings won 3–0, led by the goaltending of Jonathan Quick, who shut out the Rangers on 32 shots. The first period was marked by tight checking, and only nine shots were recorded by the two teams. Mats Zuccarello nearly scored for the Rangers at 12:37 of the first, but his shot went off the post and Quick's stick to stay out. With one second to play, Jeff Carter's shot from the slot deflected off a Rangers defenceman past Henrik Lundqvist to put the Kings ahead by one. In the second period, Jake Muzzin scored from the point on another deflection off a Rangers player. Mike Richards scored later in the period, on a two-on-one, his attempted pass deflecting off a Rangers player back to him, leaving Lundqvist out of position to make the stop. Meanwhile, Quick stopped all 17 shots the Rangers put on the net in the second, including a stick save on Derick Brassard when he appeared to be well out of position to make the save. There was no scoring in the third and the Kings took a three games to none series lead, putting the Rangers on the brink of elimination.\nGame four.\nThe Rangers avoided becoming the first team since 1998 to get swept in the Finals by defeating the Kings 2–1. In a turn-around from game three, the Kings outshot the Rangers and lost as Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist saved 40 out of 41 shots. Like games one and two, the Rangers scored the first two goals, on goals by Benoit Pouliot and Martin St. Louis. Dustin Brown scored for the Kings in the second period to cut the margin to 2–1. In the third period, the Kings put pressure on the Rangers and nearly tied the score when the puck slid past Lundqvist to rest on the goal line before being cleared away. Earlier, in the first period, another shot by the Kings also rested on the goal line and did not go in. In all, the Kings outshot the Rangers 15–1 in the third, but did not score. \nGame five.\nThe Kings clinched their second Stanley Cup in franchise history, their first since 2012, by defeating the Rangers 3–2 on home ice. This was the first Stanley Cup–clinching game since 2010 to be determined in overtime, and the first time that the home team had the overtime Stanley Cup winner since 1980. The Kings played 26 playoff games on their road to the trophy, more than any previous Stanley Cup–winning team.\nThe Kings grabbed the lead in the first period with an even-strength goal by Justin Williams. In the second, Chris Kreider converted on a Rangers power play before Brian Boyle scored a short-handed goal to put the road team up by one with 30 seconds left. In the third, Marian Gaborik tied the game at two on a Kings power play. No more goals were scored in regulation and the game went to overtime. The first overtime period featured one penalty for the Kings, but the Rangers were unable to score on the ensuing power play. With five minutes to go in the second overtime period and the Kings on a 3-on-2 breakaway, Tyler Toffoli fired a shot that Henrik Lundqvist kicked out directly to Alec Martinez, who fired it into the open net to win both the game and the series for the Kings. At that time, the Kings had outshot the Rangers 51–30. It was the longest game in Kings history until 2018.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nNew York Rangers.\nNote: \"Brad Richards served as the Rangers unofficial team captain during the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs. Richards was the alternate captain with the longest tenure in the league on the roster at the time of the playoffs.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2014 Stanley Cup was presented to Kings captain Dustin Brown by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Kings 3–2 overtime win over the Rangers in game five.\nThe following Kings players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2013–14 Los Angeles Kings\nTelevision.\nThis was the last year under the League's current Canadian TV contracts with CBC (English broadcasts of the Finals) and the cable network TSN (English broadcasts), and RDS (French broadcasts). The NHL's twelve-year contract with Rogers Communications would then take effect beginning next season, with English-language national coverage of the Finals being sub-licensed to CBC, and French-language telecasts being sub-licensed to TVA Sports. TSN will only be showing regional games for Toronto, Ottawa and Winnipeg starting the fall of 2014.\nIn the United States, NBCSN broadcast games three and four, while NBC televised the remaining games. NBC Sports originally planned to repeat its coverage pattern from the last few seasons: NBCSN would televise game two and three, while NBC would broadcast game one, and then games four to seven. After the League scheduled game two on the day of the 2014 Belmont Stakes, coverage of games two and four were switched so NBC's telecast of the horse race would serve as lead-in programming to game two. Due to the death of a family member, NBC lead play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick missed game one. Kenny Albert, who was also the Rangers radio announcer for WEPN and announced several national games (including the Western Conference Finals) for NBC/NBCSN, filled in for Emrick in the first game."
