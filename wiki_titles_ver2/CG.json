        "title": "List of ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan",
        "text": "The province of Saskatchewan is home to five Western Hockey League teams, twelve Junior A teams – eleven in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League and one in the Alberta Junior Hockey League – and one Junior B league comprising thirteen teams. The province is also home to two universities teams playing in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association and one college team that plays in the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference.\nThe first professional ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan were the Regina Capitals and the Saskatoon Sheiks who first played in the Western Canada Hockey League's (WCHL) inaugural season in 1921–22. After the collapse of the WCHL following the 1925–26 season, these teams and the Moose Jaw Maroons joined the Prairie Hockey League (PHL). The PHL folded after two seasons, which resulted in the end of professional hockey in Saskatchewan. In 1952 professional hockey returned to Saskatchewan when the Saskatoon Quakers joined the minor-pro Western Hockey League (WHL). The Quakers folded in 1956 and were replaced by the Saskatoon/St. Paul Regals who split their home games between Saskatoon and St. Paul, Minnesota for the 1957–58 season. The following season, the Regals became the second incarnation of the Saskatoon Quakers, abandoning St. Paul, but folded after just one season, leaving the province without professional hockey once again. Since then, there have been a number of attempts to return professional hockey to Saskatchewan. In 1983, a bid to buy and relocate the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues to Saskatoon was vetoed by the NHL, who preferred to find an owner to keep the team in St. Louis. In 2009, Ice Edge attempted to purchase the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes with a plan to keep the team in Phoenix, but to also play five home games a year in Saskatoon. However, The Conference Board of Canada has reported that Saskatoon's population of approximately 250,000 is well below the minimum 750,000 required for an NHL team to survive economically. Additionally, Saskatoon was rumoured as a possible destination for the American Hockey League Manitoba Moose after the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg in 2011. However, the Moose eventually relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland, due in part to the presence of the Saskatoon Blades occupancy of the Credit Union Centre.\nThe first recorded Provincial Junior Hockey League was organized in the 1916–17, when E.C. Corbeau donated the Corbeau Cup. The first champions were the Regina Arenas. The 1916–17 season was also the first season of the Regina Pats, who are the oldest continuously operating junior team in Canada. In 1919 the Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association created the Abbott Cup in memory of E.L. (Hick) Abbott who died in the First World War. The Abbot Cup was originally awarded to the best Junior \"A\" team in Western Canada. After Western Hockey League was sanctioned as the top junior league in Western Canada and the creation of the Ed Chynoweth Cup, the Abbot Cup was awarded to the best junior \"B\" team in Western Canada until 1999 when the trophy was retired.\nOrganized women's hockey has been played in Saskatchewan since at least 1912 when a women's team was set up at the University of Saskatchewan. However, as women's hockey only became a Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) sport in 1997–98, they played unsanctioned competitions against other university and local women's teams, winning the Western Canadian women’s inter-university hockey league champion in 1921 and 1922. They also won the Saskatoon women's city championship in 1929, 1932, 1939 and 1942. Women's hockey was an intramural sport between 1955 and 1976, before the creation of the Labatt Cup: Women’s Hockey Tournament, later renamed the Western Canada Cup, in 1979. The University of Saskatchewan played in the first CIS sanctioned women's championship in the 1997–98 season, while the University of Regina women's team joined one year later. The University of Regina won their first, and only, conference title in 2000–01. In 2004, the Saskatchewan Prairie Ice began play in the minor-pro Western Women's Hockey League based out of Lumsden located near Regina. After three losing seasons the team folded in 2007 due to financial reasons. Saskatchewan has won one Abby Hoffman Cup, awarded to the Canadian senior women's \"A\" champion, won by the Notre Dame Hounds in 2010–11.\nThis list does not include teams below the junior age group, or senior teams below the AAA level.\nMajor professional.\nWestern Canada Hockey League.\nThe Western Canada Hockey League was the first major-professional league on the prairies. Founded in 1921, it collapsed in 1926.\nMinor professional.\nWestern Hockey League.\nThe professional Western Hockey League was formed following a merger with the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Canada Senior Hockey League. The Saskatoon Quakers lost their amateur status when they joined the new league.\nJunior.\nWith no professional teams, the top level of hockey in Saskatchewan is junior. Five teams compete in the Major-Junior Western Hockey League, while the Junior-A Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League comprises 12 teams. The border city of Lloydminster competes in the Alberta Junior Hockey League.\nWestern Hockey League.\nCurrent teams\nFormer teams\nSaskatchewan Junior Hockey League.\nCurrent teams\nFormer teams\nJunior B Hockey leagues.\nThe Prairie Junior Hockey League merged with the North Saskatchewan Junior B Hockey League in 2007 to create a more manageable province-wide league.\nSemi-professional, senior and amateur.\nWestern Women's Hockey League.\nThe Western Women's Hockey League (WWHL) and the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) were the top levels of women's hockey in Canada until 2007 with the creation of the Canadian Women's Hockey League. In 2006, an agreement was made that the WWHL would become a division within the NWHL, but would remain an independent league. There was no competition between the winners of the two leagues to determine an overall winner.\nSenior.\nThree senior AAA hockey teams from Saskatchewan have captured the Allan Cup as the national Senior hockey champion of Canada. the Lloydminster Border Kings are the defending Allan Cup champions.\nUniversity.\nThe Canada West Universities Athletic Association was founded in 1919, representing schools across Western Canada.\nCollege.\nThe Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference organizes sport at the collegiate level."

        "text": "The Nigeria men's national basketball team () represents Nigeria in international basketball, and it is governed by the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF).\nIn March 2021, the global governing body FIBA ranked Nigeria as Africa's top men's basketball nation. After the 2016 Olympic Men's Basketball Tournament in Rio, Nigeria was ranked 16th in the FIBA World Rankings, making them the top climber in FIBA rankings from 2015.\nNigeria is the only African nation to beat the United States. Nigeria is also the first African team to qualify for the Summer Olympics through the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. This was accomplished at the 2012 Event when Nigeria beat the world elite teams of Lithuania and Greece. In 2015, Nigeria won its first crown as basketball champion of Africa.\nHistory.\nThe history of basketball in Nigeria goes as far back as the late 1950s when Walid Zabadne served as the first basketball coach to train Nigerians. At the time, Nigeria's only basketball court was situated in the Syrian Club in Lagos. Walid Zabadne continued teaching young Nigerians to become basketballers and when Nigeria's basketball federation was organized, he took them to several basketball competitions across Africa. In view of his role as the pioneer of basketball in Nigeria, Walid Zabadne has been deemed \"father of Nigerian basketball’’. Also worthy of note is that Zabadne was later made the president of the Nigerian Basketball Federation.\nNigeria's national basketball team joined FIBA in 1964. Since the mid-1990s, the team has enjoyed unprecedented success, due to an increasing amount of talents from Nigeria as well as an orchestrated recruitment of American college and professional players of Nigerian descent. The D'Tigers (as the team is nicknamed) qualified for the 2006 FIBA World Championship, marking only the second time in the country's history that they qualified to the FIBA World Cup. Team Nigeria usually plays its home games at the 3,000-capacity Indoor Sports Hall in Lagos.\n2006 FIBA World Championship.\nNigeria took part in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan. They were drawn in Group A with Argentina, France, Lebanon, Serbia and Montenegro, and Venezuela. They surprisingly finished third in Group A, then were narrowly defeated by Germany in the Round of 16. Overall they finished 14th, as they achieved the same record as the defending world champion Serbia and Montenegro.\n2012 Summer Olympics.\nNigeria competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics. They finished the group play with a 1–4 record, with their lone victory coming against Tunisia in their Olympics debut. The team's roster, assembled by coach Ayodele Bakare, primarily comprised former college basketball players.\n2016 Summer Olympics.\nNigeria qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics tournament as champions of AfroBasket 2015. They finished at the bottom of Group B, winning one game against Croatia and losing four games. The team entered the 2016 games with several injured players and little financial support from the Nigerian government.\n2020 Summer Olympics.\nAs the top African team at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Nigeria qualified for their third consecutive Olympics berth for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The team, which included seven NBA players and was led by Golden State Warriors assistant coach Mike Brown, was called up for training in the United States in June 2021. D'Tigers defeated the United States 90–87 during an exhibition game in Las Vegas on 10 July.

        "text": "The Ulster Senior League, currently known as the Ulster Rugby Premiership, is a rugby union competition for senior clubs in the Irish province of Ulster. It was formed by the then Northern Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union in October 1890. It has traditionally being ranked second in importance to the Ulster Senior Cup. It has declined in importance due to the formation of the All-Ireland League and growth in importance of the Heineken Cup.\nThe Senior League has had a chequered history. Its value was marred in the amateur era by periods when the elite clubs like North, Instonians and Collegians withdrew from the league to allow them to fulfil more friendly fixtures - particularly against English and Welsh opposition. This attitude from some of the senior clubs even lead to the scrapping of the league in 1930, and it was not re-established until after World War II. The practice of withdrawing from the league finally died out in the 1970s.\nMostly the league was played in one section on an all-play-all home and away basis. However, with the expansion of the number of Senior Clubs in 1980, two sections were formed and the top two teams qualified for semi-finals. This allowed for a showpiece final at the end of the season.\nThe two section arrangement continued until 1990 when the advent of professionalism and preparation for the All-Ireland League, saw the league separated into two sections based on playing ability. Promotion and relegation between the two sections was introduced at this time. This later gave way to a single-division league.\nFor the 2015-16 season, the Ulster Senior League was revamped as the Ulster Championship League. To avoid the fixture congestion caused by playing in two competitions, Ulster's ten All-Ireland League clubs were divided into two sections, based on last season's league standings - Ballynahinch, Armagh, Ballymena, City of Derry and Malone in Section 1, and Queen's University, Belfast Harlequins, Rainey Old Boys, Banbridge and Dungannon in Section 2 - with each team playing just four matches. For the 2016-17 season it was revamped again as the SONI Ulster Rugby Premiership, sponsored by System Operator for Northern Ireland.\nThe winners receive the Stevenson Shield."

        "text": "The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2001 took place February 15–25, 2001 in Lahti, Finland for a record sixth time, previous events being held in 1926, 1938, 1958, 1978 and 1989. These championships also saw the most event changes since the 1950s with the 5 km women and 10 km men's events being discontinued, the 10 km women and 15 km men's events return to their normal status for the first time since the 1991 championships, the debut of a combined pursuit as a separate category (5 km + 5 km for women, 10 km + 10 km for men), the addition of the individual sprint race for both genders, and the debut of the ski jumping team normal hill event. Extremely cold weather () cancelled the women's 30 km event. The biggest controversy occurred when a doping scandal hit the host nation of Finland, resulting in six disqualifications. This would serve as a prelude to further doping cases in cross country skiing at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City the following year.\nMen's cross-country.\n1 km individual sprint.\nFebruary 21. 2001\n15 km classical.\nFebruary 15, 2001\nFinnish skier Jari Isometsä finished fourth, but was disqualified for using plasma expanders.\n10 km + 10 km combined pursuit.\nFebruary 17, 2001\nFinland's Jari Isometsä finished second, but was disqualified for using of plasma expanders.\n30 km classical.\nFebruary 19, 2001\n50 km freestyle.\nFebruary 25, 2001\n4 × 10 km relay.\nFebruary 22, 2001\nThe Finnish team finished first, but was disqualified when Janne Immonen, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi tested positive for doping.\nWomen's cross-country.\n1 km individual sprint.\nFebruary 21, 2001\n10 km classical.\nFebruary 20, 2001\n5 km + 5 km combined pursuit.\nFebruary 18, 2001\n15 km classical.\nFebruary 15, 2001\n4 × 5 km relay.\nFebruary 23, 2001\nThe Finnish relay team finished second, but was disqualified when Milla Jauho and Virpi Kuitunen were tested positive for doping.\nMen's Nordic combined.\n7.5 km sprint.\nFebruary 24, 2001\n15 km Individual Gundersen.\nFebruary 15, 2001\nVik becomes the first repeat world champion in this event since Oddbjørn Hagen did it in 1934 and 1935.\n4 × 5 km team.\nFebruary 20, 2001\nMen's ski jumping.\nIndividual normal hill.\nFebruary 23, 2001\nIndividual large hill.\nFebruary 19, 2001\nTeam normal hill.\nFebruary 25, 2001\nTeam large hill.\nFebruary 21, 2001\nDoping controversy.\nThe 2001 Doping Scandal in Lahti () saw six Finnish cross-country skiers testing positive for doping, referred to as the \"Lahti Six\".\nOn 18 February, Jari Isometsä tested positive for use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a banned blood plasma expander. The test was carried out after the 15 km classical race, before the 10+10 km pursuit where Isometsä placed second. Isometsä admitted to using the HES product Hemohes and was immediately suspended.\nThe Finnish relay teams won gold in the men's race and silver in the women's race. However, it was revealed on 25 February, the last day of the championships, that Janne Immonen also had tested positive for using HES. This led to the disqualification of the men's relay team (Norway thus won the gold medal). After further testing, four more cross-country skiers provided positive doping tests: Harri Kirvesniemi and Mika Myllylä, Milla Jauho and Virpi Kuitunen. The Finnish women's relay team was thus also disqualified, although Kuitunen was allowed to retain her gold medal in the 5+5 km pursuit. Kirvesniemi retired while the others served two year suspensions. The revelations led to the resignation of the medical staff of the cross-country team, and also the team leadership such as head coach Kari-Pekka Kyrö.\nCoinciding with the doping tests, Finnish newspaper \"Helsingin Sanomat\" revealed on 26 February that a woman had found a suspicious bag at a petrol station near Helsinki Airport. The bag contained several vials with what was later revealed to be HES-products and other products such as adrenaline and asthma medicines. The incident occurred after the last World Cup races before the championships, held in Otepää in Estonia only a week before the opening.\nThis incident, along with the doping disqualifications of Olga Danilova, Larisa Lazutina, and Johann Mühlegg at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and Kaisa Varis at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2003 in Val di Fiemme, would force the International Olympic Committee and the International Ski Federation to tighten up their drug testing procedures. Incidentally, all of these skiers took individual medals during the 2001 championships. Varis was also part of the disqualified Finnish women's relay team in 2001, although she retained an individual bronze medal.\nDoping concerns were also strongly mentioned at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.\nMedal table.\nMedal winners by nation."

        "text": "&lt;onlyinclude&gt;This is a list of ice hockey teams in Alberta. It features the leagues they have played for, and championships won.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSince hockey was introduced to Alberta, Canada, in the 1890s, teams at all levels have come and gone. While the professional ranks have been confined to the major cities of Calgary and Edmonton, partially due to geographical isolation from the major eastern and Pacific coast population centres, both junior and senior teams thrive across the province.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Alberta is home to two National Hockey League teams, five Western Hockey League teams, the 16-team Alberta Junior Hockey League, and five Junior B hockey leagues comprising over 50 teams. The Canadian Women's Hockey League is represented in Alberta, as are teams competing at the senior, university and college ranks.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nThis list does not include teams below the junior age group, or adult teams below Senior AA.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nMajor professional.\nNational Hockey League.\nThe Edmonton Oilers became the first National Hockey League team in Alberta as a result of the NHL–WHA merger. The Calgary Flames arrived from Atlanta the following year.\nWestern Canada Hockey League.\nThe Western Canada Hockey League was the first major-professional league on the prairies. Founded in 1921, it collapsed due to escalating costs in 1926, and was reformed as the Prairie Hockey League from 1926 to 1928.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWorld Hockey Association.\nThe World Hockey Association had envisioned that franchises in Calgary and Edmonton would create an effective rivalry. When the Calgary Broncos were unable to start their inaugural season, the Oilers were briefly renamed the Alberta Oilers with the intention of splitting games between the two cities. This plan failed to materialize.\nMinor professional.\nAmerican Hockey League.\nThe Edmonton Oilers brought their American Hockey League franchise to the Alberta capital during the 2004–05 NHL lockout season. The team was suspended following the resumption of the NHL, and was eventually reformed as the Oklahoma City Barons. The Calgary Wranglers, the AHL affiliate of the Calgary Flames, play at the same arena.\nWestern Hockey League.\nThe professional Western Hockey League was formed following a merger with the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Western Canada Senior Hockey League. Both Alberta franchises lost their amateur status when they joined the new league.\nJunior.\nWestern Hockey League.\nThe Major-Junior Western Hockey League was formed in 1966 to strengthen junior hockey in the west. The Calgary Buffaloes were the only expansion team, as the other six founding members defected from existing leagues.\nCurrent teams\nFormer teams\nAlberta Junior Hockey League.\nThe Junior A Alberta Junior Hockey League was founded to improve the level of junior hockey in Alberta, motivated by the dominance of the Edmonton Oil Kings in the early 1960s.\nJunior female.\nThe Alberta Junior Female Hockey League was founded in 2009 to promote female junior hockey for players aged 18–21 in Alberta. The league has grown from its original 6 team to 10 teams throughout the province.\nSemi-professional, senior and amateur.\nWomen's hockey teams.\nBoth of Alberta's elite women's teams were invited to join the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) in 2002. In 2004, they broke away to form the Western Women's Hockey League (WWHL) due to the lack of competition in the west. They returned to the NWHL in 2006 following a merger between the two leagues. However, due to circumstances arising over scheduling between the WWHL and the NWHL, the merger was never completed. This, coupled with the collapse of the NWHL in 2007, left the Oval X-Treme and Chimos as members of the WWHL. The league announced on April 19, 2011, that it would merge with the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) for the 2011–12 season. The merger was to feature one team based in Edmonton and Calgary and is a combination of the former WWHL franchises, the Edmonton Chimos and Strathmore Rockies, with games in various locations around Alberta. In August 2011, the WWHL announced that there had never officially been a merger and that the WWHL would continue to compete against the CWHL, but the WWHL never played another game. Team Alberta commenced play in the CWHL in 2011 before taking on the identity of the Calgary Inferno in 2013. The CWHL and the Inferno ceased operations in 2019.\nSenior.\nSeveral teams from Alberta have gone on to capture the Allan Cup, Canada's national senior championship.\nUniversity.\nThe Canada West Universities Athletic Association was founded in 1919, representing schools across Western Canada.\nCollege.\nThe Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference organizes sport at the collegiate level.\nLeague, regional and national championships.\nTeams from Alberta have captured titles at all levels of hockey."

While with the Yankees, he won two World Series championships, back to back in 1977 and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Stanley currently serves as the director of player development for the San Francisco Giants.\nCareer.\nNicknamed \"Chicken\", Stanley was a key backup to Bucky Dent of the Yankees teams in the late 1970s and was a part of the Yankees championship teams in both 1977 and 1978. Stanley was a favorite player of Phil Rizzuto, who did the color analysis for the Yankees during this timeframe. On September 8, 1973, Stanley hit the last grand slam at the original Yankee Stadium.\nSince 1960, no other non-pitcher has had as many seasons (nine) with at least 30 at-bats and five or fewer extra base hits.\nOn October 12, 2007, Stanley was appointed as the Giants' Director of Player Development. Prior to that, he held several positions in the Giants' organization, including spending 2000–2004 as a minor league manager. In 2001, Stanley managed the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes to the league championship of the Northwest League.\nStanley was the last active player in the major leagues to have played for the short-lived Seattle Pilots franchise."

        "title": "Don Edwards (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Donald Laurie Edwards (born September 28, 1955) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League for the Buffalo Sabres, Calgary Flames, and Toronto Maple Leafs.\nPlaying career.\nEdwards started his hockey career in the juniors with the Kitchener Rangers in the OHA-Jr. He was very successful, playing in 90 games over 2 seasons, but was not considered a high draft pick, because of his small size. Despite that, he was still picked 89th overall in the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft by the Buffalo Sabres.\nIn his first NHL season, Edwards played in 25 games after spending the prior season in the AHL with the Hershey Bears. He finished the season with 16 wins, 7 losses and a 2.51 GAA.\nOn February 13, 1977, Edwards played a role in perhaps the most unusual event in Sabres history. A day after Edwards reported to Buffalo from Hershey, Sabres general manager Punch Imlach ordered coach Floyd Smith to have Edwards replace expected starting goaltender Al Smith:\n\"I got to the locker room at about 5 p.m. for the game. We all went out on the ice and Al Smith took all of the warm-ups. Then I was sitting next to him in the locker room right before game time and said 'Good luck tonight.' He looked at me and said 'You don't know you're playing?'\"\n\"That sort of ended the conversation right there. I was dumbfounded. So they play the anthem and when it ends Al hops off the bench, skates about five strides and says 'See you, Seymour' to Sabres owner Seymour Knox in the crowd. Then he skates off the ice. Also referred to by Sabre fans as \"Sayonara\" So it's my first game in the NHL and I was the only goalie in uniform.\"\nIn 1978, Edwards was named the top goalie for the Sabres. He played in 72 games and was selected to the NHL Second All-Star Team. Next season, the Sabres cut Edwards' games down because they were afraid of overusing him. Edwards shared his duties with goaltender Bob Sauve and Edwards finished with 26-18-9 record. In 1980, he and Sauve were awarded the Vezina Trophy for their performance. Edwards was also selected to the NHL Second All-Star Team and played in the All-Star Game. On February 24, 1982, Edwards was a part of history as he gave up Wayne Gretzky's 77th goal in a game vs. the Edmonton Oilers at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. With that goal, Wayne Gretzky broke Phil Esposito's record of 76 goals.\nEdwards played two more seasons with the Sabres before being traded on June 8, 1982 to the Calgary Flames with teammate Richie Dunn and a second round draft pick in 1982 (Rich Kromm) in 1982 in exchange for a first round pick in 1982 (Paul Cyr), second-round picks in 1982 (Jens Johansson) and 1983 (John Tucker). In three years in Calgary, Edwards did not reach the same level of play as he had during his time in Buffalo. On May 29, 1985 Calgary traded Edwards in 1986 to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his favorite team as a child, in exchange for future considerations that turned into a 4th round pick in 1987 (Tim Harris). Edwards played in 38 games with the Leafs before the remaining 2 years of his contract were bought out, marking the end of his NHL career. He went on to win an Allan Cup with the Brantford Mott's Clammatos before playing his last game with the Nova Scotia Oilers in the AHL in 1988 where he would officially retire.\nInternational play.\nAlthough Edwards enjoyed several successful seasons in Buffalo, he named the Sabres' 6-1 victory over the Soviet Red Army on January 3, 1980 as his greatest moment in a Buffalo uniform. Edwards was named the game's most valuable player.\n\"I have this belief that hockey is a North American game, and I still believe that today. The Soviets were great intimidators, and I remember Team Canada '72. Then I had the chance to personally go through that intimidation stuff on the ice. Because of it, I had a distinct dislike of the Soviets and wanted to do everything I could to beat them.\"\nIn 1981, Edwards was selected to play for Team Canada in the Canada Cup. Edwards played in only one game because he was the back-up goaltender to Mike Liut. He helped Canada finish second in the tournament.\nPost-playing career.\nAn outstanding golfer, Edwards spent parts of his off-seasons participating in tournaments. He also held coaching positions in the National Hockey League, serving as the Los Angeles Kings' assistant coach and the Carolina Hurricanes' goaltending coach. He was the general manager of the Saginaw Spirit of the Ontario Hockey League from 2007 to 2008.\nEdwards worked as a broadcaster on TSN and as a real estate agent, prior to the 1991 murders of his parents. Edwards relinquished the two careers as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder\nPersonal life.\nEdwards grew up a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, fulfilling a childhood dream by ending his NHL career with the team.\nEdwards is the son of Arnold and Donna Edwards. On March 21, 1991, Edwards' parents were murdered in their Hamilton home by George Lovie, who was briefly in a relationship with Edwards' sister, Michele. Lovie was sentenced to life in prison following the murders. He was granted day parole in 2020, and full parole in 2024.\nEdwards is married and has two children. Since the murders of his parents, Edwards has gone to great lengths to protect his family's privacy by not disclosing their names or location of residence to the media.\nEdwards is the nephew of former NHL hockey player, Roy Edwards."

        "title": "Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling",
        "text": "Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is a sports video game released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 1998 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999.\nGameplay.\nThese are the following game modes:\nThere are different lane conditions and different balls that react differently (the actual bowling balls, however, were all reactive, though several balls in the game are depicted as straight balls) as well as a physics engine that simulates real-life bowling physics.\nThe game includes a create-your-own-bowler feature. There are also Brunswick Pro Staff members such as:\nDevelopment.\nThe N64 version of the game was showcased at E3 1999.\nReception.\nThe PlayStation version received favorable reviews, while the PC version received average reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. \"Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling\"s biggest supporters called the game addictive and the most accurate Bowling simulation ever. More lukewarm reviewers, written by critics uninterested in bowling, suggested only hardcore fans of the sport may enjoy the game. Jules Grant of \"The Electric Playground\" wrote in a three-month-early review of the PlayStation version that while there were different difficulty levels, there was no explanation of game rules and ball physics for those new to Bowling.\nA common highlight was the game's realistic simulation of the sport, particularly with the physics. \"PC Gamer\" critic Joel Durham Jr. noted that the complexity of the pin movements led to varying, unexpected results: \"Once in a while you’ll get lucky and a downed pin will roll into that last remaining pin for a strike; other times, you'll think you nailed the pocket but wind up with a split.\" \"Next Generation\" said that the PlayStation version's \"only downfall is that it's kind of a slow-paced game with forgettable music and general-looking graphics. Still, it's good in all the right areas of gameplay, and it plays well.\"\nPositive comments were made on the features, such as the high amount of them. Durham Jr. and \"AllGame\"s Michael L. House claimed that the different oil patterns and gameplay modes, such as practice, incentivized players to improve their skills. Wrote Durham Jr., \"you'll be yearning to raise your average just a little bit, or trying to nail those three strikes you need in the tenth to break 200\". \"GameSpot\"s Jeff Gerstmann praised the video clips about the bowlers, calling them \"the most hilarious gaming moments in recent memory\", and recommended even non-Bowling fans to buy the game just to see them. \"Game Informer\" enjoyed the replay option unusual in other games, and the Cosmic Bowling feature \"because it's just too gaudy not to like\". \"IGN\"s Tal Blevins also loved Cosmic Bowling, calling it one of the game's best modes.\nSome reviewers generally found the presentation unspectacular. Reviews of the PC version from Jonah Falcon of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" and Scott A. May of \"Computer Gaming World\" found the graphics to take too little advantage of the 3D acceleration hardware. Blevins was repulsed by the still background crowd and little amount of sound effects, suggesting commentary audio should've been incorporated to spice up the experience. \"Game Informer\" also disliked the lack of commentary, was annoyed by the repetitive crowd sound effects, found the player character animations limited, and noted there is \"little happening onscreen, yet somehow the graphics are still choppy\". Grant and \"GamePro\"s Air Hendrix, although just as lukewarm, opined that it looked and sounded the best a Bowling simulation could.\nFalcon and Grant targeted the player characters. Grant disliked the limited options of bowler customization, particularly when it came to faces, clothing colors, and the absence of female characters. Falcon was outraged by the fact that there were no females, given that \"bowling is one sport in which women are truly on par with the men, and have mixed pairs (like tennis and golf)\". Additionally, he called out their \"creepy\" faces as well as the inability to vary body types, thus making the characters too similar to each other.\nHowever, the visuals and sound were not without compliment, the player character animations a common highlight. Blevins applauded the soundtrack, particularly its variety of styles, which \"ranges from funky fuzz guitar jams that remind me of \"Interstate '76\" to AC/DC inspired heavy-metal licks\". \"GameSpot\"s Jeff Gerstmann praised the use of several camera angles and \"surprisingly good\" music.\nCriticism was targeted toward the simple controls and setup. \"AllGame\" critic Anthony Baize argued the gameplay amounted to nothing more than pressing a single button frequently. Grant, May, Hendrix and Durham Jr. claimed that, despite the simple controls and setup, the experience was made complex and \"smooth\" by aspects such as realistic and unpredictable pin physics, differing levels of ball responses to the controls, and changing oil patterns between bowling alleys.\n\"Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2\".\nA sequel, \"Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2\", was only released for the PlayStation. It featured more characters (now including female characters), an easier throw system and many others."

        "title": "Kevin Ryan (rugby)",
        "text": "Kevin James Ryan (born 26 August 1934) is an Australian former state parliamentarian and local mayor, barrister and advocate. In the 1950s and 1960s he was an Australian dual-code rugby international representative and had previously been a Queensland amateur boxing champion in 1958 and 1959, who trialled for the 1960 Olympics.\nBackground.\nRaised in the Somerset Region in Linville, Queensland to Irish-Australian Roman Catholic parents, May Helena Ryan and her husband Matthew a bushman and horseman, he learnt the rudiments of boxing as a young boy. He attended boarding-school for his high-school years at St Joseph's College, Nudgee from 1948 to 1952 where he started to play rugby union.\nRugby union career.\nAfter school Ryan played seven seasons with the Brisbane Brothers club from 1953 to 1959. In the Writer interview he refers to a senior player-coach role that he performed in his final two years at the club and he spoke of the loyalty he felt to the club in 1959 when having agreed terms with St George and having achieved his rugby union representative ambitions, he played out the 1959 season with Brothers and helped them win the 1959 Brisbane Club Premiership.\nHe was selected in the squad for the 1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. He made his international representative debut in the 3rd Test match of the tour, that against England national rugby union team at Twickenham on 1 February 1958. Australian were beaten 9–6. Following the tour's end he made four further appearances for the Wallabies in 1958, firstly against a visiting NZ Maori All Blacks side and then in all three Tests against the All Blacks on the Wallabies 1958 tour of New Zealand.\nRugby league career.\nSt. George.\nHe was a front rower or second row forward with the St. George Dragons in the latter half of their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He played 106 games for the club from 1960 to 1966, and played in seven winning grand finals. Ryan took over the 'Hard Man' mantle in the St George forward pack from Billy Wilson. From 1960 to 1962 when Ryan, Wilson and Norm Provan played together the St George forward pack was formidable. Ryan perfected a ball-and-all, one-on-one tackling style. He disdained gang tackling believing it was his individual responsibility to bring his man down hard without help. He would leave the ground each time he tackled, often winding his opponent with his shoulder, then bringing them to ground wrapped up, ball included.\nDuring his footballing career Ryan was nicknamed 'Kandos' after the New South Wales cement producing town due to his on-field toughness.\nHe was selected in the squad for the 1963 Kangaroos tour of Great Britain and played in four tour matches on the tour. Along with Jim Lisle, Ryan made his international league debut in a tour match in England in 1963 but he did not play in any Tests on the tour. Collectively he and Lisle were Australia's 29th and 30th dual code rugby internationals. He later represented Australia in two domestic Tests against France, making his Test debut in 1964 in the 2nd Test in July 1964 at Lang Park, Brisbane. Ryan is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 386.\nCanterbury-Bankstown.\nRyan left St George at the end of the 1966 season unable to come to terms in negotiations and wanting to coach. In 1967, as captain-coach, he led Canterbury in their 12–11 victory over St George in the preliminary final. He is therefore sometimes credited with bringing an end to the Dragons' premiership run. Certainly he was able to coach against and counter many of their tactics but the game had changed for all in 1967 with the introduction of the four tackle rule and the now maturing Dragons stars like all other teams in the competition, had to deal with a whole new style of game.\nHe led Canterbury to the 1967 Grand Final against South Sydney and was captain-coach at the club through to the middle of the 1969 season when he retired due to injury. He continued on as coach that year and for the 1970 season. He played 52 games for Canterbury, scoring five tries.\nAfter football.\nAfter retiring from football, Ryan became a barrister in 1970, and was an Alderman or Mayor of the City of Hurstville from 1974 to 1979. He was elected as the Labor Party member for Hurstville in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1976, defeating four-term Liberal MP Tom Mead, and serving until 1984. He had previously made an unsuccessful bid for the seat in 1973. Ryan was defeated by Liberal candidate Guy Yeomans at the 1984 election. The result was considered a minor upset as Labor comfortably won the election overall. Ryan's critics within the Labor Party suggested that he had failed to nurse the electorate sufficiently. Ryan contested the 1987 Bankstown by-election as an independent in opposition to the official Labor candidate. He polled 18.6% but was third behind the Labor candidate Doug Shedden. He contested the electorate again as an independent at the 1988 election but was again defeated with 18.7% of the vote.\nRyan was President of the Rugby League Players Association for many years and a sports commentator with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1970 to 1973 where he usually worked alongside Alan Marks commentating on NSWRFL games. he still practises as a barrister at Selborne Chambers in Sydney.\nAccolades.\nIn 2000 Ryan was awarded the Australian Sports Medal. In 2004 he was named at prop-forward for the Berries to Bulldogs 70 Year Team of Champions On 1 April 2007 he was inducted into the Bulldogs Ring of Champions."

        "title": "PBA Tour",
        "text": "The PBA Tour is the major professional tour for ten-pin bowling, operated by the Professional Bowlers Association. Headquartered in Mechanicsville, Virginia, over 3,000 members worldwide make up the PBA. While most of the PBA members are Regional professionals, a small percentage of the bowling membership competes at the national and international level, forming the PBA Tour. (PBA.com lists 57 bowlers that have Tier 1 national touring pro status as of the start of the 2024 season.) Founded in 1958, the PBA Tour has been in continuous operation since the inaugural .\nEach year, the PBA Tour puts on a series of events for PBA members. Most events are held across the United States, with the PBA co-sponsoring selected international events as part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT). In addition, the PBA Tour has co-hosted the Round1 Japan Cup along with the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA). Also, select American members compete against their European counterparts in the Weber Cup.\nQualifying for the PBA Tour.\nFrom the PBA Tour's inception through the 2003–04 season, most national PBA Tour events were open to the entire PBA membership. The initial tournament squads typically included well over 100 bowlers, who would bowl a set number of qualifying games to determine the \"cut line\" for additional qualifying and/or match play (typically 64 bowlers).\nThe Exempt Tour (2004–05 through 2011–12).\nStarting in October 2004, the PBA adopted an all-exempt national tour format. In this format, only 64 bowlers competed in most weekly events. Bowlers earned exemptions by winning a tournament during the previous season, winning one of the four major tournaments (thus gaining a multi-year exemption), placing among the top finishers in points, leading a region on the PBA Regional Tour (2005–2007), finishing in a high position at the PBA Tour Trials (2005–2008), or placing high enough at the PBA Regional Players Invitational Tournament (2008–2011).\nUnder this new format, bona fide status as a touring professional was not a guarantee; it had to be earned. The 2005 H&amp;R Block Tournament of Champions was pivotal, as Randy Pedersen was facing the loss of his exempt status in the semi-final match against Norm Duke. On his final shot, Pedersen left a weak 7-pin and immediately singled out the sidelines, accusing a spectator of distracting him as he made his shot. From that point, Pedersen would have to bowl in the Tour Qualifying Round (TQR) in order to try making the initial field of 64.\nCriticism of the format was brought forth by long-time PBA fans when popular 24-time winner Brian Voss lost his tour exemption following the 2006–07 season. 19-time titlist Amleto Monacelli also lost his exemption at the same time.\nDepending on the season, a set number of bowlers (for example, 58 bowlers in the 2008–09 season) earned exemptions which automatically placed them in the starting field of 64 bowlers each week. The remaining spots needed to bring the field to 64 were awarded each week through the PBA Tour Qualifying Round (TQR), also called the \"rabbit squad\". PBA Commissioner Fred Schreyer would often award one spot in the field to a former touring pro under the \"Commissioner's Exemption\", meaning even fewer spots were available via the TQR. For example, PBA Hall of Famer and Medford, Oregon resident Marshall Holman competed on a Commissioner's Exemption at the Bayer Earl Anthony Medford Classic held in that city in January 2009.\nDuring the TQR, amateur and non-exempt PBA bowlers bowled 7 games of qualifying. The top amateur bowler advanced (no matter where he or she finished), along with the top-scoring PBA members needed to round out the field. In the , rookie Rhino Page made a remarkable five TV finals appearances (winning one title) despite having to bowl in the TQR every week.\nQualifying via PBA Tour Trials and RPI.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, the PBA held the \"PBA Tour Trials\" in late May/early June to determine the bowlers who would will fill the remaining open spots on the following season's exempt player list. The number of exemptions awarded at the PBA Tour Trials varied—10 spots were available in 2006–07, but only seven spots at the start of the 2007–08 and 2008–09 campaigns. That number could increase or decrease due to injury deferments for currently exempt bowlers. At the Tour Trials, non-exempt PBA and international bowlers bowled nine games each day for five straight days on the five primary PBA oil patterns. (See \"PBA Tour lane preparation\" later in this article.)\nAt the 2006 Denny's PBA Tour Trials, Kelly Kulick made history by becoming the first woman to ever gain a PBA exemption (she was exempt for the 2006–07 season). (Before it dissolved, Kulick was the 2001 Rookie of the Year on the PWBA, won the 2003 U.S. Women's Open, and was a three-time member of Team USA.) Kulick later earned a two-year exemption to the main PBA Tour with her victory in the Tournament of Champions; she had earned her spot in that event by winning the PBA Women's World Championship, the tour's first major championship in its Women's Series.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the Tour Trials were replaced by the PBA Regional Players Invitational (RPI). For the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, the top eight finishers at the RPI were offered PBA Tour exemptions, though not all of them accepted. At the 2011 RPI, 58-year-old Kerry Painter finished eighth and made history by becoming the oldest player to ever earn a PBA Tour exemption.\nExempt Tour discontinued (2012–13 and beyond).\nIn November 2011, the PBA announced that they would discontinue the exempt tour format for the . Due to the changing climate of the Tour itself, the number of all-exempt events had been steadily declining in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons, until there were only three exempt events for the 2011–12 season. This change meant that all but two events during the 2012–13 PBA national tour were open to all players.\nThe two notable exceptions to the open policy are the PBA Tournament of Champions (TOC) and the Round1 Japan Cup. The TOC accepts only the most recent 48 PBA Tour titlists (with a \"Touring 1\" or \"Touring 2\" status), plus past winners of the TOC itself. The Japan Cup invites the top sixteen PBA Tour bowlers (based on final points standing of the previous season), and four at-large PBA Tour players selected by the tournament committee.\nWhile the \"exempt player\" designation was removed, the PBA announced that players would be able to earn \"Touring 1\" and \"Touring 2\" statuses, which will offer certain benefits and bonuses. \"Touring 1\" status is awarded to all bowlers who enter at least 80 percent of a season's tournaments, including the World Series of Bowling, at least two majors, and at least three PBA Xtra Frame events. \"Touring 2\" status is awarded for players entering at least 60 percent of a season's tournaments, including the World Series, at least one major, and at least one Xtra Frame event. To earn either status, players must also average 190 or higher in PBA Tour events.\nWhile the PBA points list no longer affects exempt status, there are incentives for finishing high on the list — such as eligibility for certain tournaments like the PBA Players Championship (begun in 2011–12), PBA Tour Finals (begun in 2017) and PBA Playoffs (begun in 2019).\nFinals formats.\nPrior to the debut of the PBA on ABC television in 1962, most tournaments were organized where, once the cut was established after qualifying rounds, a set number of match-play games were bowled, and bonus pins were given to the winner of each match. The champion was then decided based on the final overall total pinfall.\nFrom 1962 to 1965, ABC started televising the PBA Tour, starting with a limited number of tournaments on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\", and later having its own timeslot. Therefore, a round-robin tournament format was implemented to determine the champion. The televised finals would be cut to the top four bowlers after match-play, and then three round-robin matches between the fourth, third and second-seeded bowlers would determine the final two bowlers. If any bowler were to win both of his matches in the round-robin, he would go on to face the tournament leader. If the three bowlers each split their matches to go 1 and 1 in the round-robin, total pinfall would decide which man would advance to the final match to face the tournament leader. The winner of the final match would win the tournament.\nFrom the late 1960s to 1997 (with the exception of one year), televised events were done in a \"stepladder\" format. Four matches would be held, with the #5 and #4 seeds from the qualifying rounds meeting first. The winner of the first match would bowl the #3 seed, and likewise up to the top spot.\nABC experimented in 1993 with a \"King Of The Hill\" format. Under this arrangement, only the top four seeds made it to the television finals, instead of five, with the traditional stepladder format. The #4 and #3 seeds met first, with the winner facing the #2 seed, and that winner then facing the #1 seed. The winner of the tournament faced the current \"King\" for an additional cash prize. The winner of the King of the Hill match would then bowl the winner of the following week's tournament. The \"King\" could defend his title even when not competing in the event hosting it. The tour resumed its normal \"stepladder\" format the following year.\nThe bowler who won himself the most notoriety for winning \"King\" matches was Ron Williams, who won only four tourneys in his career, yet held the \"King\" spot for five consecutive weeks that year.\nSpecial formats were also used on occasion in conjunction with Old Spice deodorant, which sponsored a \"Winning Never Gets Old\" challenge annually in the mid-1990s. The winner of the championship would bowl a Seniors Tour bowler for the rights to an extra $10,000.\nWhen the PBA Tour moved to CBS in 1998, a two-match format was adopted. Again going to four bowlers, the #2, #3, and #4 players bowled in one \"shootout\" match, with the winner facing the tournament's #1 qualifier for the championship. From 1998 to 2000, also, the PBA used gold-colored pins with black stripes or crowns (depending on if Brunswick or AMF was involved in the alley) for their televised finals. The pins returned to regular white in 2001.\nWhen the PBA Tour introduced the World Series of Bowling during the 2009–10 season, the televised finals for all tournaments in the series used the four-man bracket format. It was changed to a five-man stepladder for the 2010-11 season. During the 2011 WSOB, an \"eliminator\" format was used. The top four qualifiers all bowled together, and the top three scorers would move on to the next match, with the lowest score finishing in fourth place. The next match would then take the two top scorers (low score finishing in third place), and these two bowlers competed head-to-head in the final match. For the 2012-13 \"Super Season\", the WSOB switched back to the four-man stepladder format, with the exception of the PBA World Championship which featured a five-man stepladder final. The format has changed multiple times since then.\nThe Road to the Finals.\nAfter the PBA's sale and move of broadcasts to ESPN, most tournaments used a \"bracketed\" format. Each bowler bowled nine qualifying games, with the top 64 by pinfall competing in best 4-of-7 head-to-head matches. The four remaining bowlers from match play competed in two semi-final matches (#4 seed vs. #1 seed, and #3 seed vs. #2 seed), followed by a final match of the semi-final winners. A few tournaments still used the stepladder format for the finals.\nIn January 2005, the PBA tournament format was modified because of the all exempt tour. Non-exempt bowlers bowled on the first day to determine the additional six (or more) bowlers who qualify for the tournament (on top of the exempt field). The second day consisted of 64 bowlers rolling 14 games (two 7-game blocks) to determine the 32 bowlers who made \"match play\" on the third day. Seeding of the top 32 was based on a rolling points list of the 20 previous events.\nThe third day featured 32 bowlers competing in potentially 21 matches in a single day. It started with the first round in the morning, followed by the second round (\"Round of 16\") after lunch. That night, the quarterfinal (\"Round of 8\") matches were conducted. All matches were a best 4-of-7 format. The four quarterfinal winners made the field for the televised finals. Depending on the finals format, a fifth bowler could be added based on highest pinfall among the quarterfinal non-winners.\nThe championship round remained single head-to-head matches for semifinals and finals on the final day. Beginning in the 2009–10 season, a majority of the finals had returned to the stepladder format.\n2009–10 changes.\nFor the first five exempt events of the 2009–10 season, the starting field consisted of 72 bowlers all rolling 14 games of qualifying in one day (two blocks of 7 games each) to determine the top 28. The top four bowlers by pinfall automatically earned a spot in the Round of 16 match play. The other 12 spots for the Round of 16 were determined in a separate match play round for the #5 through #28 seeds. The eight winners from the Round of 16 match play then bowled a final match play round to determine the four bowlers who advanced to the TV finals.\nAll match play rounds were on the second day of the tournament, and all were best 4-of-7 matches.\nMost PBA titles.\nThe following are the top 20 titles winners in PBA Tour history. The table lists the name and the number of titles. Players who are:\nAll players listed are members of the PBA Hall of Fame, except Jason Belmonte and E. J. Tackett. Belmonte and Tackett are title-eligible, but have not yet met the years-on-tour requirement.\nIn May 2008, the PBA announced that it was revising its all-time records to include USBC Masters and BPAA All-Star titles if they were bowled by a PBA member. American Bowling Congress (the merger took place in 2005) Masters titles prior to 1998 and BPAA All-Star (U.S. Open prior to 1971) titles were previously not counted as PBA titles. The events bowled in the PBA era (since 1959) are now counted as both a PBA title and a major title. The most significant impact of this change is that Dick Weber moves from a 10th place tie on the all-time titles list to 8th place (30 titles) while picking up four more majors (all BPAA All-Star events). Also, Earl Anthony is credited with two more major titles, both being USBC Masters, giving him ten majors among his 43 total titles. Pete Weber tied Anthony with ten major titles after his win in the 2013 PBA Tournament of Champions. Both players were surpassed by Jason Belmonte, who won his record 11th major title in 2019 and now owns 15 majors.\nFather and son titlists.\nDick Weber and Pete Weber became the first father-and-son combination to both win titles on the national PBA Tour, after Pete won the Greater Hartford Open on . They are also the only father-and-son duo to both be ranked in the top ten all-time for PBA Tour titles (Dick earned 30 titles-eighth place and Pete has 37 titles-fourth place). They have since been joined by four other father-son titlists:\nKevin McCune's victory at the 2023 PBA Players Championship made the McCune family the only one with three generations of PBA Tour title holders.\nPlayer of the Year.\nThe PBA Player of the Year began being officially recognized in 1963. It was awarded by \"The Sporting News\" from 1963–70, and by the PBA membership from 1971–2007. Some factors used in the voting process for a given season included major titles, total titles, Tour average ranking, points ranking, season earnings and TV finals appearances. In 1999, the award was officially renamed the Chris Schenkel PBA Player of the Year, in honor of the legendary broadcaster who covered bowling on national television for 35 years.\nBilly Hardwick was the first bowler to be awarded an official PBA Player of the Year honor, and is also the youngest (22) to ever win the award. The mid-1970s to early-1980s were dominated by Earl Anthony and Mark Roth. The two won 10 of the 11 P.O.Y. awards between 1974 and 1984, and faced off in many memorable finals. Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Jason Belmonte have won the most P.O.Y. awards (7 each), one more than Anthony. Williams is also the oldest bowler to be named Player of the Year, earning the 2009–10 award at age 50.\nIn the 2007–08 season, a new Player of the Year system was instituted, where a points system only determined the winner. Chris Barnes became the first Player of the Year winner under this new system in 2008, edging out Walter Ray Williams Jr. by two points. The points-only system lasted just three seasons, and by the 2010–11 season, a player vote was again part of the process.\nPBA Tour lane preparation.\nUnlike the typical \"league condition\" or \"house shot\", which facilitates a fairly consistent pattern and wider target area, the PBA rotates several challenging lane oil patterns throughout the season. The initial named patterns — known as Cheetah, Viper, Scorpion, Shark and Chameleon — feature varying oil volumes and lengths that require pros to adjust ball angle, rotation and speed accordingly. On some patterns, certain \"strike lines\" (areas of the lane) are unplayable, and spare shooting becomes much more important. This means a 220 average on the PBA Tour would easily translate to 20-30 pins higher on a typical league shot.\nTo put this theory to the test, the PBA held a special \"Ultimate Scoring Championship\" in the 2008–09 season, with pro bowlers competing on a typical league lane condition. The event took place November 9–11, 2008 in Taylor, Michigan, prior to the PBA Chameleon Championship that took place in the same bowling center. The lane conditions indeed proved easier for the professionals, as three of the four finalists averaged better than 250 during match play.\nCustom oil patterns are used for the four major tournaments. In addition, the PBA introduced the Dick Weber pattern for two 2008–09 tournaments (including the Denny's Dick Weber Open), plus a newly designed \"Earl\" pattern for the Earl Anthony Medford Classic. Beginning in the 2018 season, the PBA began incorporating several more \"legends\" oil patterns (e.g., Mark Roth 42, Carmen Salvino 44, etc.) in addition to the Weber, Anthony and \"animal\" oil patterns.\nThough most PBA pros tend to bowl their best on one or two of the PBA oil patterns, two players, Mika Koivuniemi and Tommy Jones, have managed to win at least one title on all five of the standard \"animal\" patterns.\nThe USBC is also grasping the PBA lane conditions. Called the \"USBC PBA Experience\", amateurs are able to experience and test their bowling skills against PBA-like conditions, by participating in a USBC sanctioned league style called \"Sport Bowling\".\nFor the 2013 World Series of Bowling and into the , the PBA began using lane oil that is dyed blue for televised matches, thus helping viewers not only see the pattern layout but also see how the play area changes from game to game. Said ESPN Coordinating Producer Kathy Cook, \"Until now, one of the most crucial and least understood aspects of the game was invisible.\"\nThe shortest pattern used in the 2019 PBA Tour season was the 32-foot Wolf pattern, and the longest was the 48-foot Shark pattern.\n2009 and later PBA Tour season changes.\n2009–10 World Series of Bowling.\nIn a cost-cutting effort, the PBA split the 2009–10 season into two segments. The first, the 2009 World Series of Bowling, consisted of seven PBA Tour events—including one major tournament (PBA World Championship) – held in August and September 2009 in Allen Park, MI, near Detroit. All of the events ran in a split format: the early rounds of each tournament were held on consecutive days in August and September, and ESPN television taped the final rounds for the tournaments on Labor Day weekend (September 5–7). These were aired on seven Sundays, October 25 through December 6, 2009.\nThe final rounds for the Women's and Senior PBA World Championship were taped September 5 and were broadcast on October 25. The final round for the \"open\" PBA World Championship was broadcast live on December 13.\nThe Motor City Open and PBA World Championship were open to the entire PBA membership. The fields for the five exempt events were increased from 64 to 72, with the additional spots going to TQR qualifiers and the new \"Golden Parachute\" entry reserved for a formerly-exempt player. Under the Golden Parachute rule, any formerly exempt PBA member who lost his/her exemption during past four years was able to apply for this new exempt position. (It was awarded to 24-time PBA titlist Brian Voss.) Following the 2009–10 season, the Golden Parachute exemption will come \"only\" from the previous year's crop of players who lose their exemption due to points.\nThe exempt PBA Women's Series fields were increased from 16 to 20. The Women's Series added qualifiers for the exempt events to fill two of the four additional spots.\nThe second half of the season, running January–April 2010, consisted of 11 traditional touring weekly tournaments, including the remaining three majors. Each event ended with the live ESPN television finals on Sundays. The second half also included three special (non-title) televised events: the Chris Paul PBA Celebrity Invitational, the PBA Experience Showdown, and the PBA Women's Series Showdown.\n2010–11 season.\nThe PBA announced in May, 2010 that it would again cover all of the Fall tournaments for the upcoming season at the World Series of Bowling. The second annual event was held October 24 through November 6, 2010 at South Point Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It consisted of five title events, qualifying for the PBA World Championship, and one non-title, made-for-TV event. Based on input from players, as well as corporate partner and ESPN television needs, there were some revisions to the series:\nThe format for the second half of the 2010–11 season included the remaining three majors (USBC Masters, Tournament of Champions and U.S. Open), as well as the first-ever Dick Weber PBA Playoffs. The 2011 Tournament of Champions had the largest prize fund ($1 million U.S.) and largest first-place prize ($250,000 U.S.) in PBA history.\n2011–12 season.\nThe PBA announced in June 2011 that it would again cover all of the Fall tournaments for the upcoming season at the World Series of Bowling, and that the event would have a $1 million prize fund. The event was held November 4–20, 2011 and returned to the South Point Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It included both the qualifying and final rounds of the PBA World Championship, the first major tournament of the season.\nThe second half of the PBA Tour season includes the three remaining majors (USBC Masters, Lumber Liquidators U.S. Open and Tournament of Champions), plus four additional title events.\n2012–13 season.\nThe PBA announced in June, 2012 that the 2012–13 PBA season would include an unprecedented 40 title events. The season began in November, 2012 with the 2012 World Series of Bowling and concluded with a second World Series of Bowling starting in November, 2013. There were 15 international stops on the 2012–13 tour, which are now counted as PBA titles if won by a full-fledged PBA member. The 14-month season was done in preparation for a return to a calendar year national tour format in 2014. The PBA had not had a calendar year format since the 2000 season. The PBA also abandoned its \"exempt player\" tour format prior to this season.\n2017–18: BPAA partnership.\nOn June 22, 2017, the PBA announced a partnership with the Bowling Proprietors Association of America (BPAA) and that organization's website GoBowling.com, noting that the PBA Tour from December 2017 through July 2018 will be renamed the Go Bowling! PBA Tour. There was an option for the partnership to be extended to additional Tour seasons.\n2019: Acquisition by Bowlero Corporation.\nIn September 2019, the PBA and PBA Tour were purchased by Bowlero Corporation. Colie Edison, Bowlero's former Customer Service Officer, was named CEO of the PBA. Tom Clark was retained as PBA Commissioner.\nPBA Tour major championships.\nThe PBA Tour has five events that have been considered major tournaments over the history of the organization:\nUSBC Masters.\nCurrent defending champion: DeeRonn Booker\nNote: In May 2008, the PBA announced that it was revising its all-time records to include ABC Masters wins in the PBA era prior to 1998 as PBA major titles, if the person who earned the title was a PBA member at the time. One notable result of this change is that Earl Anthony's long-standing 41 career titles count was increased to 43, as he had won the and Masters events.\nPBA World Championship.\nCurrent defending champion: E. J. Tackett\nTournament of Champions.\nCurrent defending champion: Marshall Kent\nUnited States Open.\nCurrent defending champion: Kyle Troup\nPBA Players Championship.\nCurrent defending champion: Bill O'Neill\nPBA Triple Crown.\nThe three \"original\" major championships (PBA World Championship, Tournament of Champions and U.S. Open) make up the PBA's \"Triple Crown.\"\nOnly nine bowlers in the history of the PBA have won all three jewels of the Triple Crown in their careers:\nOf the nine, Pete Weber is the only player to have won each Triple Crown event at least \"twice\" in his career (five U.S. Opens, two PBA World Championships, and two Tournament of Champions titles). Despite 47 and 43 titles respectively, Walter Ray Williams and Earl Anthony are not Triple Crown winners. As mentioned, Anthony never won the U.S. Open, though he finished runner-up in the event three times. Williams has never won the Tournament of Champions, but he has a runner-up finish there.\nPBA Grand Slam.\nMike Aulby, Norm Duke, and Jason Belmonte are the three of the nine PBA \"Triple Crown\" winners who have also won the ABC/USBC Masters, thus giving them the unofficial \"grand slam\" of pro bowling.\nDon Carter is also noted for having won all four possible \"majors\" during his career (PBA National Championship, BPAA All-Star, World Invitational and ABC Masters), however some of these were not PBA events.\nPBA Super Slam.\nMike Aulby and Jason Belmonte are the only bowlers to have won the PBA \"super slam\", which includes a win in all four \"grand slam\" events in addition to a PBA Players Championship title (known as the Touring Players Championship at the time of Aulby's win).\nMost majors in PBA history.\n+ = Includes four BPAA All-Star wins earned before the PBA era.\nBold = denotes leader in individual major\nPBA Tour in the media.\nThe PBA provided its first televised event in 1962, and became a Saturday afternoon staple on the ABC schedule from 1965.\nIn its heyday, ABC's Professional Bowlers Tour outranked all sporting events on Saturdays with the exception of some college football telecasts.\nOn March 21, 2018, the PBA announced that Fox Sports signed a multi-year agreement to acquire the television rights to its events beginning in 2019. Most events will be carried by the Fox Sports 1 cable network, but at least four events per season will air on the broadcast Fox network.\nTelevised conversions of the \"impossible splits\".\nMark Roth, whose first career title was captured at the 1975 PBA King Louie Open in Overland Park, Kansas by rolling a televised 299 game against Steve Jones, gained immortality by becoming the first bowler to convert the almost-impossible 7–10 split (or \"bedposts\") on national television in the first match of the ARC Alameda Open on January 5, 1980. In 1991, both John Mazza and Jess Stayrook accomplished this feat on television. Nearly 30 years later, 18-year old rookie Anthony Neuer became the fourth PBA player to convert the 7–10 split on television, doing so in the semifinal match of the 2021 U.S. Open against Jakob Butturff.\nEven rarer than a 7–10 split conversion, the 4–6–7–10, or the \"Big Four,\" though statistically easier than the 7–10, has only been made once in the Tour's television history, by Walter Ray Williams Jr. at the 2005 PBA Atlanta Classic against Ryan Shafer.\nPerfect and near-perfect televised games.\nThe following is a list of all perfect 300 games in nationally televised PBA Tour title events (PBA Hall of Famers marked with an asterisk; major tournaments in bold text):"

Their current commercial name is T &amp; A San Marino, because the team is primarily sponsored by Italian company Tecnologie e Ambiente S.A. They are currently being managed by Doriano Bindi.\nHistory.\nBaseball first got an audience in the 1960s, where some Sammarinese boys returning from the United States introduced it to their peers. A first San Marino Baseball Club was founded in 1970, where they entered Italian league Serie D, and promoted to the next tier Serie C four years later in 1974, and finally arriving in Serie C in 1980. In 1985, the club was transformed into a newer one, and the team entered Serie A1 Italian championships, the top series of Italian baseball where the team has played ever since. In 1992, the team made their first international debut, where they qualified to compete in the European Baseball Cup. Ever since, the team have competed in the international tournament and have remained securely in Serie A1. San Marino now organize teams to enter Italian youth tournaments, where many additional titles have been won.\nBallpark.\nT &amp; A San Marino play home games at the Stadio di Baseball di Serravalle baseball stadium. It is located in Serravalle and has a capacity of 1,500. The venue was used in the 2016 European Cup to co-host the games along with Italy. The stadium was constructed in 1986, and renovated for the European Cup. When the stadium reaches capacity, there is a hill on the side of the venue which can host spectators on the grass if required.\nThe stadium has been the home of T &amp; A San Marino for almost all of their history since 1985 where they were transformed into the current club.\nCompetitions.\nT &amp; A San Marino often appear in the European Baseball Cup, with five final appearances and three victories in total.\nThe team also competes in the Serie A1, where they have won the title five times in total in 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013 and most recently 2021."

        "text": "The Clover Hill Swimming Club, in the Millington section of Long Hill Township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, was a swim club operating in the 1960s in the suburban New York City metropolitan region.\nIncorporated on October 6, 1961, the Clover Hill Swimming Club was a privately owned, for-profit corporation by constructing and operating \"beach, swimming, tennis or recreation areas on the plan and form of a private membership club\" in what was then called Passaic Township. When Clover Hill began operations in 1963, about 250 families had purchased memberships. The total zoned capacity of the built club was fixed at 400 families. During the period of construction and for some time thereafter, there was displayed at the entrance to Clover Hill an sign which read:\nGeography.\nThe club was centered on a lake filled with water from the club's well. The lake bottom was covered with stones, with white sand covering the beach, extending out into the water. The lake had a dock and a deep water float. Bleachers overlooked 25 meter swim lanes. The club's swimming teams competed with other clubs. Other amenities typical of swim clubs, such as tennis facilities and a playground, were available. In the early 1990s the adjacent land was developed as a suburban neighborhood. The clubhouse was replaced by picnic facilities after it was torn down. As part of the neighborhood's development, the club's docks were also removed. The land and facilities of the old swim club are now managed by the neighborhood homeowner's association.\nCourt case.\nThe club was the defendant in a landmark 1966 civil rights case, \"Clover Hill Swimming Club v. Robert F. Goldsboro\". The club was sued by an African American veterinarian who said he was denied membership because of his race. The club claimed that because it was private, the Law of Discrimination did not apply and therefore it could pick its own membership, despite the fact that the club advertised at the entrance to Clover Hill and in newspapers that it had a policy of open membership. After the Clover Hill Swimming Club appealed the first decision, the Supreme Court of New Jersey again sided with the plaintiff."

        "title": "Dutch Lacrosse Association",
        "text": "The Dutch Lacrosse Association () is the official governing body of lacrosse in the Netherlands. The Nederland Lacrosse Bond sponsors both a men's and women's national team. The national team programs are supported by a burgeoning domestic club league (the DNLL consists of 12 men's teams, while the WDNLL supports six female teams). The NLB is a full member of both the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) and the European Lacrosse Federation (ELF). \nThe Netherlands' first international tournament was in 2004 when the men's team competed at the European Lacrosse Championships in Prague, Czech Republic. The team finished 9th out of 12 countries. Since then, the men's national team has competed at the World Lacrosse Championships in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, with their best showing of 8th place in 2010. The team competed at the European Lacrosse Championships in 2008, 2012, and 2016, plus a host of smaller invitational club tournaments throughout Europe. Their best finish was a Silver medal at the 2008 ELF. \nThe women's first campaign was in 2008 when the team finished 10th at the European Lacrosse Championships in Lahti, Finland. The women’s team took 7th place in 2012 and 13th place in 2015.\nMen's 2018 World Lacrosse Championships, Netanya, Israel.\nThe Netherlands started in the white division together with Norway and Japan. The Netherlands finished 22nd of the 46 participating teams at the world championship. \nMen's 2014 World Lacrosse Championships, Denver, CO, USA.\nRoster: Men.\nSTAFF\nMen's &amp; Women's 2012 European Lacrosse Championships, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nRoster: Men.\nSTAFF\nMen's 2010 World Lacrosse Championships, Manchester, England.\nRoster.\nSTAFF\nMen's 2008 European Championship campaign.\nThe Netherlands competed in their second European Lacrosse Championship in 2008 in Lahti, Finland. They compiled a 6-2 record at the tournament, finishing 2nd place behind defending European champions, England. The team surprised the lacrosse world, defeating traditional European lacrosse powers such as Sweden, Ireland and Germany before making their appearance in the gold medal game. The success of the Dutch campaign garnered mention in major lacrosse publications and placed the Netherlands on the lacrosse map for the first time in history.\nThe Dutch team played in the C Division, featuring Austria, Denmark, France, Scotland, and Sweden. They compiled a 4-1 record in round robin play, resulting in a three-way tie for first with Sweden and Scotland, and a goals for/against record of 76/25. Goal differential determined that Sweden would finish first, with the Netherlands taking the second spot of the group. The Dutch team went on to beat Ireland and Germany in elimination play before losing to perennial champions England in the championship final. \nMany attributed the team's success in Finland to the two weeks of isolation and training in Den Helder prior to the tournament.\nGame results.\nThe Netherlands opened the tournament with a convincing win over Austria, beating Sweden the very next day in a tightly contested 1 goal match. They then went on to beat Denmark before losing a controversial one goal game to Scotland. The team concluded group play with a lopsided victory over newcomer France. \nA second-place finish in Group C advanced the Dutch team to the knockout stage of the tournament. They beat Ireland in a closely fought one-goal quarterfinal game before rolling the Germans in a convincing 12-6 semi-final victory. \nThe Dutch team played 8 games in 10 days at various fields throughout Lahti, Finland. Detailed game results are listed below.\nTeam organization.\nAt the helm of the men's national program was long time lacrosse business man, John Bergsma. John's wealth of experience within the National Lacrosse League and Team Canada was supported by coaches from both North America and the United Kingdom. Travis Taylor, a native of New Westminster, British Columbia and head coach at the University of Bristol, was named head coach, while MacGregor Stockdale (a former defenseman at Brown University), Nigel Greenall (head coach of Ashton lacrosse in Northern England), and Richard Bos (Groningen Lacrosse, Netherlands) were all hired as assistant coaches.\nThe team formed new sponsorships for the European campaign, dropping their previous partnerships with Riddell and STX. Team helmets were provided by New York-based Cascade Sports and all equipment and apparel was provided by Michigan based Warrior Sports.\nTournament preparation.\nThe Dutch team centralized in the Netherlands two weeks before the European Championships, bringing all players to Den Helder (in the north of the Netherlands) for an intensive 14-day training camp. \nThe NLB formed a strategic partnership with the Royal Netherlands Navy, using their extensive facilities in Den Helder as preparation grounds for the campaign in Finland. In addition to their grueling three-a-day practice schedule, the Dutch team took part in several naval training exercises, followed a strict eating regime, and stayed in barracks on the base.\nFor press purposes, one practice was scheduled at a field outside of the base. On July 27 friends, family, and the public at large came to watch as the team practiced under a hot, sun-drenched afternoon in the city centre of Den Helder.\nMen's 2006 World Championship campaign.\nThe Netherlands competed in their first World Lacrosse Championships in 2006 in London, Ontario, Canada. Led by a contingent of Dutch ex-pats from North America. These players included many ex (NLL)(WLA) pro players, Jonas Derks (NLL from 1998-2008) bolstered the Dutch attack, Aaron Vanderhorst (WLA 2000-2015) was noted in the midfield, Vanderhorst is on track to have competed in every World Championshil, since 2006. He will be donning the Orange of the Dutch in the 2019 World Indoor championships. Well former UWO Mustang standout Andrew Dowdell (Major series 2000,NLL 2001)locked down the goaltending position, he was also tooted as a player to watch throughout the games, according to official program. Dowdell had suffered a shortened NLL and Major career as a result of head Injuries. Despite, his past head injuries Dowdell was rock solid in the cage for the Dutch. The Dutch national team finished with a 3-4 record at the tournament. They also made ILF history by becoming the first team to win their debut game at their first World Championships (defeating South Korea by a score of 12-4).\nThe Netherlands competed in the Orange Group, featuring Germany, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, and South Korea. Competing against these countries in round-robin play, the Dutch group amassed a 2-2 record, with convincing wins over both South Korea and New Zealand. The Netherlands then went on to beat Latvia (10-4) before falling to Finland in a tightly-fought and controversial 2 goal game (final score: 8-10). The group went on to lose their last game to a talented Scotland squad, but finished the tournament in 12th place (out of 21 countries).\nGame results.\nThe Netherlands played 7 games in 8 days, all at the North London Athletic Fields. The game results are listed below.\nTeam organization.\nThe staff, led by General Manager Cornelius Derks, was composed entirely of North American coaches during the 2006 tournament. Corny, a native of Oshawa, Ontario, performed managerial duties while David Leich (head coach of the University of Western Ontario Mustangs), Jason Crosbie (standout player from the Buffalo Bandits of the NLL), and Jim Huelskamp (Former Salisbury State University All-American) acted as assistant coaches.\nWaterford Development (a Washington D.C.-based real estate developer) was the team's main sponsor. Exclusive partnerships with lacrosse equipment and apparel suppliers were formed: STX (based out of Baltimore, Maryland) provided the team with equipment while Riddell supplied the team with helmets. Atlantic Sportswear provided apparel for the Netherlands and the team was outfitted in their famous \"Orange\" colors."

        "text": "Edward Arnet Johnson (born May 1, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player who spent 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and a year in the Greek Basket League midway through his career. With nearly 1,200 games in the NBA, he scored the second-most career points among players who never played in an NBA All-Star Game, behind Jamal Crawford. As of the 2018–19 season, he is ranked 52nd in all-time points scored, and ranked fifth-most in points scored by an eligible player not in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. he is the co-host of \"NBA Today\", which airs weekdays on Sirius XM NBA Radio and also is the play-by-play TV analyst for the Phoenix Suns on Bally Sports Arizona.\nEarly life and college career.\nAfter graduating from Chicago's Westinghouse High School, Johnson, a sharpshooting 6'7\" forward/guard, attended the University of Illinois, majoring in history, before being selected by the Kansas City Kings in the 1981 NBA draft. Among Fighting Illini fans he is probably best remembered for his game-winning shot against Michigan State University (MSU). At the time, MSU, which was led by future all-time NBA great Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, was undefeated and ranked #1 in the nation, but Illinois was also undefeated at 14–0. The victory gave Illinois a 15–0 record and the #2 ranking nationally (Illinois subsequently faded during regular season play, but MSU went on to become eventual National Champions).\nJohnson was elected to the \"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\" in 2004.\nEddie Johnson was selected as a member of the 2019 class of the Illinois Athletics Hall of Fame.\nPlaying career.\nNBA.\nJohnson would play for the Kings, the Phoenix Suns, the Seattle SuperSonics, the Charlotte Hornets, the Indiana Pacers, the Houston Rockets, and Greek team Olympiacos (1994–1995) before retiring from basketball in 1999. Although his 19,202 points over 1,199 NBA games was the 22nd-highest total in NBA history at the time of his retirement, Johnson was never selected to play in the All-Star game nor ever chosen for an All-NBA team. In fact, the \"awards highlight\" of his career occurred in 1989, when he received the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award as a member of the Suns. Johnson's career point total of 19,202 is also higher than all but 30 inductees into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nEurope.\nJohnson also played for one year in the Greek Basket League, with the FIBA EuroLeague powerhouse Olympiacos Piraeus, in the 1994–95 season. He became a cult favorite with the fans of Olympiacos, for his phenomenal shooting from outside the 3-point line. One game in particular established his enduring legend for the club's fans, when he scored four 3-pointers in the final minutes of the low-scoring and tense semi-final of the league's 1995 Final Four, which was played against Panathinaikos Athens, the arch-rivals of Olympiacos. Olympiacos won that game by a score of 58–52, but lost in the EuroLeague Final to Real Madrid Teka. In 18 games played in the EuroLeague, Johnson averaged 21.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 0.7 steals, in 35.1 minutes per game.\nJohnson did, however, taste success in the Greek Basket League, where he was instrumental in Olympiacos' 3–2 series win over Panathinaikos, in the Greek playoff finals of 1995. The fifth and vital game of that series, ended in one of the lowest-scoring games ever, as Olympiacos scraped a 45–44 victory, in a match that exhilarated the fans. In 35 games played in the Greek Basket League with Olympiacos, Johnson totaled averages of 21.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.0 steals, in 34 minutes per game, in the 1994–95 season.\nReturn to NBA.\nAfter his season overseas, he then returned to the NBA and started the 1995–96 season with the Indiana Pacers. He was traded to the Denver Nuggets on February 20, 1997, where he was quickly released. However, he signed with the Houston Rockets for the remainder of the season to where he returned for the following two seasons. Along with his Sixth Man of the Year Award, he is also remembered for hitting the game-winning three-pointer as time expired in a 95–92 Rockets win over the Utah Jazz in game 4 of the 1997 Western Conference Finals. Johnson would play an additional season for the Rockets and then 3 games the following season before finally retiring as a player.\nPost-NBA career.\nAfter his playing career was over, Johnson turned to broadcasting, serving as a color commentator for Arizona State, the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, and currently the Phoenix Suns. Johnson is also an accomplished motivational speaker, and he has recently released an instructional DVD called \"Eddie Johnson's Jumpshot and Offensive Skills\". Johnson is also a regular article contributor to the website Hoopshype.com and also enjoys debating his ideas, opinions, and thoughts with his readers.\nMistaken identity.\nIn 2006, Eddie (Arnet) Johnson was mistaken in multiple media reports for former NBA player Edward (Lee) \"Fast Eddie\" Johnson (a guard, two-time NBA All-Star, one-time All-Defensive Second Team player, and four years older than Eddie A. Johnson) when the latter was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault of a minor and burglary on August 8 (Eddie L. Johnson would eventually be sentenced to life imprisonment for that crime and die in prison). While this was not the first time that Eddie L. Johnson had been arrested (by estimates, Johnson has been arrested 100 times), the heinousness of the crime, combined with the fact that it happened during the NBA offseason when Eddie A. Johnson would not normally be on TV, generated major controversy after other outlets failed to read the initial Associated Press story (which detailed correctly \"Fast Eddie's\" career and background) and put up the wrong Eddie Johnson's picture. Johnson called that day the \"worst...of his life\" and expressed concern that the case of mistaken identity might permanently sully his reputation. Johnson expressed to Jay Mariotti of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" that he was considering legal action against the news outlets that used his picture or did not fact-check his identity against that of Edward Lee \"Fast Eddie\" Johnson."

        "text": "Rodney Duncan McCray (born September 13, 1963) is an American former professional baseball player who is best known for crashing through an outfield fence attempting to make a catch. He played mostly in the minors, but also made it to the majors with the Chicago White Sox and New York Mets from 1990 to 1992.\nEarly life and career.\nBorn in Detroit, McCray's family moved west while he was still a child. He enrolled at University High in Los Angeles, then attended West Los Angeles Junior College and Santa Monica Junior College. The speedy outfielder was drafted in the first round by the Chicago White Sox in 1982 and then by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1983, but opted to stay in school. Finally, he signed with the San Diego Padres in 1984.\nAfter four years in the Padres chain, the White Sox claimed him in the 1987 minor league draft. Never much of a hitter (his career minor league batting average was just .226), McCray proved effective by drawing walks (enough to pump his career on-base percentage up to .362) and stealing bases (as many as 91 in one season, with Charleston in 1986).\nAfter making the majors with the White Sox in 1990, McCray was sent back down to the AAA Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League the following year. On May 27, 1991, at Civic Stadium (now Providence Park) in Portland, Oregon, McCray chased after a fly ball hit by Portland's Chip Hale. McCray initially made the catch, but immediately turned to run right through a plywood fence in right field, just to the right of the marker, which caused him to drop the ball. The play was shown repeatedly on newscasts across the country; a video clip of the play is now part of a blooper reel looped at the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nMcCray made it back up to the White Sox later that year, but was used almost exclusively as a pinch runner and backup outfielder.\nAfter signing with the New York Mets in 1992, McCray was again relegated to pinch running until May 8 against the Dodgers in Shea Stadium, when he pinch-ran for Eddie Murray, stayed in the game as the right fielder and then batted in the ninth with two men on and the score tied at 3-3. Off reliever Tim Crews, McCray delivered a game-winning single in what was to be his only major league at-bat of 1992 (and the final one of his career). After appearing in two more games as a pinch runner, the Mets released McCray on June 8; after batting .242 in 61 games for the independent Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks of the Northern League in 1993, he retired as a player.\nMcCray played in 67 major league games but logged just fourteen at-bats (with three hits), while stealing nine bases in ten attempts.\nLater life.\nRodney later served as a coach in the minor-leagues for the Lethbridge Mounties in 1994 and Lansing Lugnuts in 1998, and later a minor league base running and outfield instructor in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization.\nOn August 12, 2006, McCray was honored in Portland with the \"Rodney McCray Bobblehead Night\", honoring his memorable crash through the wall. McCray threw out the first pitch, and right-center field of PGE Park was renamed \"McCray Alley\" in his honor. \"I just wish I had run through something like a Coca-Cola sign so I could have gotten endorsements,\" McCray said. \"Instead, I ran through a local sign, `Flav-R-Pac meats.'\" \nHe is currently an assistant coach for Calvin Meadlock for the C2 teams in Houston, Texas.\nESPN, in its series Who's Number 1?, ranked the fence incident as the seventh-favourite sports blooper of all time. The Best Damn Sports Show Period ranked the incident number one in their countdown of the Top 50 Devastating Hits in sports history.\nOn June 4, 2019, McCray's son Grant was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the third round of the 2019 MLB Rule 4 Draft."

Australia won the series and regained the Ashes that had been lost to England in the 2005 series. The five Tests of the series were played at Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney. In winning, Australia completed a 5–0 \"whitewash\", the first time this had happened in an Ashes series since 1920–21. The series was also notable for the retirement of four significant Australian players, namely Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. Ricky Ponting was named Player of the Series.\nLead-up.\nRicky Ponting found himself criticised by journalists on his captaincy and performances in the 2005 series during the run-up to the first Test. When questioned in a press conference on this subject, he said \"We didn't perform the way we would have liked and probably I didn't score the runs I would have liked to during the Ashes ... It's important for us to move on, to move forward from that; that is me as a player, me as a captain and the rest of the team as well ... We have managed to do that very well, we've actually played better cricket as a result of that.\"\nAndrew Flintoff, England's captain, called the series \"the reason we play ... we are going over there to play in what could be the biggest series ever so there is an excited group of lads ... it is going to be tough. We know that 2005 was something special and whether that can be recreated I am not quite sure ... in England each Test match got bigger and bigger and we got a real feeling of what the Ashes was about.\"\nThe \"Sydney Morning Herald\" newspaper described the series as \"the most anticipated Ashes series ever\", and tickets were sold out within days of being available for all the games.\nBookmakers were heavily favouring an Australian series victory, with best odds, as at 10 November, being listed on one site as Australia 1–3 to win, England 11–2 to win, and the draw 9–1.\nSale of tickets.\nCricket Australia made the first tickets available on 1 June, selling only to the registered members of the \"Australian Cricket Family\", who were able to register in the months before the ticket sale. 182,000 of 635,500 available tickets were sold on the first day and a number of buyers immediately put their tickets on eBay at inflated prices. Telephones and internet systems were delayed to such an extent that CA chief executive James Sutherland wrote a letter of apology to the Australian fans, but was still criticised by Brett Judd, the organiser of 1.5 million tickets for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Judd called their approach \"farcical\".\nOn 19 June, the remainder of the tickets went for sale to the general public and were sold out within two hours. Cricket Australia later cancelled 1,300 tickets, which they believed had been sold on eBay at inflated prices, as the tickets had \"breached conditions of sale\".\nOn 29 December, Cricket Victoria had announced that an excess of 47,000 pre-purchased tickets for the fourth day of the Boxing Day Test were to be refunded, as a result of the Test reaching its conclusion on the third day. Despite the Test lasting only three days, bumper crowds over the duration of the Test ensured that sales had generated over A$8 million in takings.\nSquads.\nBoth England and Australia went into the series with concerns about the fitness, form and availability of key players: Michael Vaughan, England's successful captain in the 2005 Ashes series, and Simon Jones, England's lowest-averaging bowler during the 2005 series, were unavailable due to injury. Australia selected Glenn McGrath for his first first-class match since he left the game in April for personal reasons. Other former Australian players such as Jason Gillespie were not selected.\nThe England squad for the tour of Australia was announced on 12 September 2006. Andrew Flintoff was selected over Andrew Strauss as the captain, in the absence of Michael Vaughan through injury. Marcus Trescothick left the squad on 14 November due to a \"recurrence of a stress-related illness\", after making 10 runs in two tour matches. Ed Joyce was called up as his replacement on 15 November. The Australian 13-man squad for the first Test was announced by Cricket Australia's National Selection Panel on 16 November 2006. Michael Clarke was called up on 18 November 2006 as cover for injury doubt Shane Watson.\nOn 8 December 2006, a week before the third Test, Damien Martyn announced he was retiring from all forms of cricket. Adam Voges and Andrew Symonds were called up to the squad to replace him.\nOn 16 December, Ashley Giles left the tour to be with his wife, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was replaced by Jamie Dalrymple.\nVenues.\nAs with other recent Ashes series in Australia, this series was played at the main cricket grounds in Australia's five largest cities.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nAustralia won the toss after Andrew Flintoff called heads. Ricky Ponting elected to bat on a good looking pitch. Steve Harmison bowled the opening over, with the first ball a wide that went straight to Flintoff at second slip. Harmison only lasted two overs, which went for 17 runs, before being replaced by James Anderson. Anderson proved just as expensive as Harmison, conceding 10 runs in his first over in his first Test match for seven months. Flintoff got Matthew Hayden to edge one to second slip on 21. Australia reached lunch without further loss on 1/79.\nIn the afternoon, Flintoff unexpectedly removed Justin Langer, who had looked set for a century but holed out to Kevin Pietersen at cover point. Ashley Giles, bowling in his first first-class match for 12 months, took the wicket of Damien Martyn but was innocuous, if inexpensive (unlike many of his colleagues), claiming no more wickets during the day. Ponting and Michael Hussey survived the final session of the day to close at 3/346. During the session, Ponting passed 100 runs in a near-faultless display, offering up only one potential lbw shout (given not out by umpire Billy Bowden) when he missed a sweep on a straight ball from Giles. The century took him level with Steve Waugh as Australia's leading century-maker, with 32 each. England's bowling was generally criticised, most notably Harmison, who was given only 12 overs out of the 90 overs bowled during the day. Andrew Flintoff was the only bowler to finish the day with his reputation enhanced, having been England's cheapest and most effective bowler. The pitch, however, was flat and not conducive to either pace or spin bowling and as England failed to use the new ball well at both the beginning and end of the day, it proved to be one of the most frustrating days in the field English cricket had endured in modern Ashes series.\nAustralia continued their dominance throughout the second day. Ponting and Hussey continued their partnership, putting together 209. Flintoff finally took Hussey's wicket when he was on 86, bowled through the gate, with the off-stump out of the ground, when he had looked set for a century. Matthew Hoggard finally made a significant breakthrough in the afternoon, taking the wickets of Ponting (for 196) and Adam Gilchrist (for a duck) in the same over, both men out lbw. Gilchrist, in particular, was out to a ball bowled from around the wicket from the right-arm bowler Hoggard, a continuation of England's tactics against him in the 2005 Ashes series, which had restricted him to a top score of 49*. Ponting's 196 allowed him to surpass Graham Gooch as the seventh highest Test run scorer of all time (Gooch scored 8,900 runs). Michael Clarke crafted a solid 56 before falling to Anderson, edging a good delivery to slip. Australia's tail wagged, with Brett Lee scoring 43 and Stuart Clark hitting a quick-fire 39 off 23 balls before having his leg stump knocked out of the ground by Flintoff. His innings included two huge sixes off the bowling of Anderson, who ended the innings with figures of 141 runs for just one wicket. Australia were able to declare their innings with the score 9/602 after tea.\nEngland had to negotiate the 17 overs remaining in the evening. After a reasonably solid start, England lost Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook in consecutive balls to Glenn McGrath. Strauss was lambasted for his dismissal, top-edging a pull on a ball too full to be suitable for the shot. Clark removed Paul Collingwood, edging an off-cutter to Gilchrist. This dismissal left England on 3/53 at the close, leaving England in a perilous position, Australia having reached a total more than 200 runs higher in any Test of the 2005 Ashes series before taking three cheap wickets before the close. Ian Bell and Pietersen were the not out batsmen, with scores of 13 and 6 respectively.\nMatters continued badly for England on day three and they ended their first innings on 157 all out just after lunch, 246 short of their follow-on target of 403. Bell was the only England batsman to offer any real resistance, spending nearly four hours at the crease before being dismissed by Clark for 50. It was a personal triumph for Bell, who had averaged just 17.10 in the 2005 series, looking particularly vulnerable against McGrath and Shane Warne. England's other specialist batsman, Pietersen, was out for only 16, trapped lbw to a ball from McGrath to which he did not offer a stroke. All-rounder and captain Flintoff was out for a duck, caught behind off what replays suggested was a no-ball (not spotted by umpire Steve Bucknor) from Brett Lee. Brief resistance also came from wicketkeeper Geraint Jones and spinner Giles, who made 19 and a quickfire 24 respectively, but both were out to McGrath. In total, McGrath took six wickets for only 50 runs conceded, a powerful response to critics who had suggested that he was, at 36, too old to be a front-line bowler in an Ashes series.\nPonting chose not to enforce the follow-on and put his team back in to bat, a decision which surprised the majority of spectators and media personnel. Australia's lead of 445 going into the second innings was one of the largest ever held by a team which had then decided not to enforce the follow-on. This decision was in contrast to Michael Vaughan's decision in the 4th Test of the 2005 series, where he had enforced the follow-on with Australia just 259 runs behind. As on the opening day, England's bowling attack was again barely able to penetrate Australia's defences, and the home side were able to end the day on 1/181, the only loss being Hayden who was run out on 37 by Anderson while attempting a risky second run. Langer and Ponting ended the day unbeaten, with Langer on 88, and Ponting on 51 having scored his 9,000th Test run during the innings. The day was the third in a row which had gone badly for England and with the pitch showing wide cracks, offering encouragement to Warne in particular, an Australian victory was widely expected at the close of play.\nAustralia continued to build a formidable lead, eventually declaring at 1/202, a lead of 647, just after Langer had passed his century, his 23rd in Test cricket. Langer ended on 100 not out while Ponting had progressed to 60. Towards the end of Australia's second innings Ponting suffered a back strain, and did not return to the field after his side's declaration.\nEngland began their second innings shakily, with Strauss out for 11 off Clark in a similar fashion to his first innings dismissal, this time hooking the ball to fine leg, the dismissal owing more to poor execution than the poor shot selection witnessed in England's first innings. Warne dismissed Cook for an industrious 43, caught by Hussey off his pads, and Bell for a duck, lbw to a slider, leaving England struggling at 3/91. Collingwood and Pietersen then rebuilt their team's innings in the second session, sharing a 153 run partnership. Collingwood was eventually stumped for 96 off the bowling of Warne, charging down the pitch while looking to reach his third Test century, and his first against Australia, and missing his shot by nearly six inches. Flintoff soon followed after scoring 16 runs, perishing to an ill-judged pull shot off the bowling of Warne. Pietersen and Jones were the not out batsmen at the end of the day, with 92 and 12 runs respectively, with England needing a further 355 for victory. Pietersen's innings was notable because of the manner in which he had suppressed legendary leg spinner Warne.\nAt one point at the end of a delivery, Warne picked up the ball and threw it to Gilchrist behind stumps albeit badly. The ball veered and headed to Pietersen, who was forced to defend himself with a reflexive hookshot. He could be seen mouthing the words, \"Fuck off!\" on conclusion of the stroke. The fourth day was a break from the norm of the Brisbane Test, which until then had gone entirely in Australia's favour. The partnership between Collingwood and Pietersen was the first of any substance in the Test for England and allowed some hope of an unlikely draw, with reports from some sources of an approaching storm.\nEngland's chances of lasting the day were effectively dashed after Pietersen flicked the ball to Damien Martyn at short midwicket off Brett Lee in the first over of the day, immediately after Australia's taking the new ball and without adding to his overnight score. Jones struck a few boundaries but edged onto his stumps off McGrath. Fellow NSW paceman Clark took the final wickets of Giles (caught at first slip), Hoggard (caught at first slip) and Harmison (caught pulling at fine leg), with England lasting only 20 overs for the day. England's fourth innings total of 370 was the highest ever achieved in a fourth innings of a Test match at the Gabba but was still nowhere near the total set by Australia. Australia won the match by 277 runs, with Ponting named man of the match for his 196 and 60 not out. The total attendance was recorded as 164,747 for the match.\nSecond Test.\nIn a similar fashion to 2005, England named an unchanged XI for the second Test, despite Cricinfo and others suggesting that it was \"almost certain\" that Monty Panesar would replace James Anderson. Australia also named an unchanged team after Glenn McGrath passed a late fitness test. He was earlier rated as a 50/50 chance to play due to a heel injury.\nAndrew Flintoff won the toss and elected to bat first. Early on, the dry flat wicket offered little for the Australian bowlers who toiled in the first hour for no wicket. Stuart Clark took the first wicket, with Andrew Strauss being caught by Damien Martyn for 14 runs. This was the third time in the series that Strauss had been caught attempting to play on the leg side. Clark then took the wicket of Alastair Cook for 27 runs, having him caught behind by Adam Gilchrist. The periods before and just after lunch were dominated by Shane Warne, who bowled with consistent line and length to keep both Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood restricted to about two runs per over. Bell continued his struggle against Warne, who beat Bell's bat on several occasions. Despite a slow scoring rate, the batsmen made a good fightback in the afternoon session, despite some persistent Australian bowling. Both batsmen reached their half-centuries in the last over before the tea interval, which England reached with the score at 144/2. After tea, England came out looking to increase the scoring rate. Soon, however, Bell was caught and bowled by Brett Lee as he skied an attempted pull to the leg side. Kevin Pietersen was aggressive from his first ball, going on to make his half-century off just 70 balls. The scoring rate increased somewhat in the evening session as England increased their score to 266/3 at stumps. Collingwood was not out on 98 runs, tantalisingly close to a maiden Ashes century. The day's honours were roughly even. Australia would have liked more than three wickets, but they did keep England's scoring rate low on a flat, dry wicket.\nAustralia resumed play on the second day with the ball only six overs old, while England's Collingwood required two runs to make a century. Collingwood made his runs in the second over of the morning, off the second ball he faced. Pietersen made his own century later in the morning. England again scored relatively slowly, but survived the first session without losing a wicket to be 347/3 at lunch. The two batsmen continued after lunch in a session that would go on to break several previous partnership records for English batting. Collingwood increased his score to a personal best innings of 206, becoming only the third Englishman to score a double-century in Australia, and the first in 70 years. He was out caught behind by Gilchrist from an outswinging Clark delivery on the final ball before tea. After the interval, Pietersen went on to make 158 before being run out. Collingwood, and particularly Pietersen, consistently attacked the Australian bowlers, forcing them to take up defensive fielding positions for the first time in the series. Noticeably, Warne bowled defensively outside leg stump from around the wicket to Pietersen, having exhausted all other methods of containment. Flintoff and Ashley Giles added 60 runs for the sixth wicket before the innings was declared at 551/6.\nThe Australian bowling was generally ineffective during the England innings, despite keeping the run rate low. McGrath conceded his first analysis of 0/100 or worse in Test cricket, and was targeted by Pietersen in particular, who took three fours off his first over of the second day. It was speculated that while McGrath had declared himself fit for the game, he was still struggling with his sore heel. Despite his defensive bowling, Warne conceded his worst innings figures of 1/167.\nAustralia had to face nine overs before the close of play. Flintoff, who opened the bowling with Matthew Hoggard, took the wicket of Justin Langer during this short period. The Australian score at stumps was 28/1, making day two the first day of the series which clearly belonged to England. However, the question remained as to whether England's bowling attack would perform any better than Australia's on a good batting pitch in the days ahead.\nEngland started the day strongly, their bowling attack testing the Australians as Hoggard claimed two wickets before lunch. The first came in the 13th over of the innings as Matthew Hayden edged a delivery to the gloves of Geraint Jones. The second was in the 23rd over when Bell took a comfortable slip catch off Martyn. This left Australia on 65/3. Anderson and Steve Harmison also bowled well, proving to be much more accurate and economical in their bowling than they had in the first Test at Brisbane.\nAt times England's fielding was inept, however. In the morning session, Ricky Ponting survived a dropped catch by Giles and a run out chance missed by Collingwood when on 35 and 43 respectively. Ponting reached his half-century just before lunch, taking his side to 3/105 at the interval.\nFollowing the lunch break, Ponting returned to build a solid partnership with Michael Hussey. The Australian batsmen remained at the crease throughout the afternoon session. Ponting reached his 33rd Test century in the 62nd over, just before tea. This score saw him become Australia's leading century-scorer in Test history and took the home side to 3/185.\nAfter tea, Australia continued to settle into their batting rhythm as Hussey reached his 50 in the 64th over. England began to lose the advantage they had established early in the day, with runs coming more easily to Australia. In the 73rd over Hussey survived a dramatic run out chance which had to be referred to the third umpire as he slid his bat back into his crease a fraction of a second before Jones broke the stumps off an Anderson throw. It was not until after the new ball had been taken in the 83rd over that England got a breakthrough. Hoggard was again the successful bowler, claiming Ponting for 142 and later Hussey for 91 in the 91st over. After the fall of Hussey's wicket, Michael Clarke and Gilchrist established themselves at the crease to end the day on 30 and 13 respectively. The Australian score was 312/5, 40 runs short of the follow-on target.\nThe Australian batsmen started well and by mid-session had started to dominate the England bowling and increase the run rate. The Australians passed the follow-on target after drinks, and shortly after this Gilchrist and Clarke made their half-centuries. Just as Gilchrist was beginning to look dangerous and starting to score quickly, Giles had him caught attempting a six. He had made 64 runs off 79 balls, and the score was 384/6. Warne joined Clarke at the crease, and the pair negotiated through to lunch, taking the score to 417/6.\nClarke and Warne put on 100 runs between them in the afternoon session, with Clarke making a century. It was late in the afternoon before England finally made some inroads, with Hoggard striking either side of the tea interval. Warne was out leg before wicket just prior to the break. Clarke was caught by Giles after tea, having made 124 runs, and with the score at 505/8. Hoggard and Anderson took a wicket each to clean up the tail within eight overs, so that Australia were all out for 513 runs off 165.3 overs.\nHoggard bowled very well to take 7/109 on an unresponsive pitch. His figures were his third best in Test cricket and his best against Australia. Meanwhile, Clarke's third Test century had helped Australia pass the follow-on target and put the game into a position in which the draw was the most likely result.\nIn their second innings, England passed 19 overs to reach the close on 59/1. Cook was the man to lose his wicket, caught by Gilchrist off the bowling of Clark for nine.\nAustralia started the fifth day needing early wickets to try to force a result. They were successful in this quest, as England's second innings stumbled to 73/4 after the overnight batsmen scored at approximately one run per over. Strauss was caught by Hussey off the bowling of Warne for 34, although replay analysis appeared to show that the ball did not make contact with bat or gloves, an audible nick was heard after the ball was played and missed, which led to the subsequent decision. In Warne's next over, Bell was run out on 26. Collingwood called for a run and set off, but Bell did not respond until it was too late. The ball went to Clarke's left hand, his dominant side, and he was able to get the ball to Warne who threw down the stumps with an underarm throw, ending Bell's innings. Warne struck again in his next over as Pietersen was clean bowled behind his legs as he attempted a sweep. Four overs later, England lost Flintoff, who edged Lee through to the wicket-keeper, leaving the score on 77/5. England scored only 30 runs in the session for the loss of four wickets, making the score at lunch 89/5, a lead of just 127.\nEngland continued to lose wickets after the break. Jones swung his bat at a wide delivery and edged to Hayden in the gully in the second over after lunch. Giles made an eight ball duck, edging to Hayden, this time at slip. Hoggard was able to block for a while, but was eventually bowled off the inside edge by Warne. Harmison and Anderson each held up an end for periods before tea, but both were trapped leg before wicket by McGrath, Anderson's wicket ending the innings. Collingwood was the not out batsman, scoring only 22 runs, but crucially occupying the crease for 119 balls and approximately three hours. England lost their last nine wickets for 60 runs. Tea was taken at the change of innings with the result of the game finely in the balance. Australia required 168 runs to win the game, while England could only hope to prevent this from happening in the remaining 36 overs and obtain a draw.\nWith a target to chase, Australia started their final innings aggressively, taking 13 off the first two overs. England hit back, as Langer was caught in the gully off Hoggard in the third over. Hayden was caught by Collingwood after top-edging Flintoff. Hussey was promoted up the batting order to join Ponting, putting Australia's two in-form batsmen at the crease. The pair steadied the innings while continuing to score runs above the required rate. Again, progress stuttered in the 22nd and 23rd overs, as Ponting was caught off Giles at short extra cover for 49, and Martyn was caught off Flintoff at point for five. However, Hussey and Clarke were able to continue Australia's progress.\nHussey saw his team home, scoring 61 not out and hitting the winning runs with three overs to spare. This set off jubilant celebrations among the Australian players and the crowd, who had poured into the Adelaide Oval during the afternoon, as news spread of England's second innings demise, and the chance of an Australian victory in the afternoon/evening session. Australia won the Test by six wickets, and led in the series by two matches to none. The official attendance over the five days was announced as 136,731. Members of the Nine Network commentary team noted that it was indeed a remarkable victory, perhaps one of the greatest in Test history. Simon Barnes argues that \"a match that should have been drawn was won by Warne's overwhelming nature; by the powerful outpouring of his chi or life force.\"\nThird Test.\nAustralia made one change to the side that won in Adelaide as Andrew Symonds came into the team following the shock retirement of Damien Martyn. England dropped Ashley Giles and James Anderson, replacing them with Monty Panesar and Sajid Mahmood respectively. Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. Panesar justified his selection taking five wickets, the best figures by an English spinner in Perth. Steve Harmison took four wickets, relieving the pressure that had been growing on him after taking 1/288 in the first two Tests. Harmison and Panesar combined to bowl Australia out for 244. Michael Hussey finished 74 not out, the only player of six top-eight batsmen to convert a 20-plus score into a long stay at the crease. England lost 2/51 after an aggressive start by openers Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss. Strauss and Paul Collingwood were the overnight batsmen, the latter having been reprieved by a dropped catch from the bowling of Stuart Clark.\nEngland lost four wickets in the first session on day two with only Kevin Pietersen of the recognised batsmen remaining at lunch. Strauss suffered another contentious decision after being adjudged caught behind off Clark when replays suggested he had missed the ball despite a nick being heard. Collingwood had already been dismissed, caught in the gully off the bowling of Glenn McGrath, and the wickets of the out of form Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones to Symonds soon followed. Australia bowled England out for 215 on the stroke of tea, giving the Australians a first innings lead of 29 runs despite lower order resistance from Panesar and Harmison as well as a 70 from Pietersen.\nIn reply, Australia's second innings began shakily with Justin Langer bowled on the very first ball by Matthew Hoggard. Australia recovered well though through Matthew Hayden and captain Ponting, who were each on an unbeaten 57 at stumps with Australia at 119/1.\nAustralia resumed at 119/1. With the Ashes series on the line and 42-degree heat, Ponting and Hayden improved on their overnight scores, but fell short of centuries, scoring 75 and 92 respectively after lunch. Michael Clarke and Hussey both recorded centuries, with Clarke's being his second in as many Tests. Hussey got out rather cheaply, being caught behind by Jones. Adam Gilchrist made a quickfire 50 off only 40 balls. After that, he hit 3 sixes and a four from one Panesar over, with the over ultimately costing 24 runs. Subsequent overs cost 10 and 18, with Gilchrist recording his century in just 57 balls, the fastest century in Ashes history and the second-fastest in all Tests to date behind Viv Richards. In an interview after the day's play, Gilchrist explained that he was unaware of how close he was to the record until after he had scored his century until Ian Healy mentioned it to him during that interview, but was not disappointed to be behind a player regarded as one of the most damaging hitters to play the game. Soon after, Ponting declared the innings and sent England in to bat. Brett Lee took Strauss' wicket with an inswinging ball, which Strauss left and it thundered into the pads and was given out, this left England at 0/1. By stumps, the score had progressed to 19/1.\nEngland resumed their innings under immense pressure, needing a further 538 runs to win with nine wickets in hand or needing to bat for two days to draw the game and keep the series alive. With the pitch looking good for batting and no real movement off the seam, this seemed possible with some sensible batting.\nIan Bell started aggressively against the Australian pace bowlers while Cook took his time, and when Shane Warne came on he found himself being battered for a 4 and a 6 by Bell off his first over. Bell continued to bat positively and posted his 10th half-century. England managed to add 80 runs for no loss, going into lunch at 99/1. Coming into the afternoon session, Bell and Cook played positively, attacking the Australian bowlers. Cook managed to post his half-century and soon England were starting to think about a victory. However, Warne got Bell caught by Justin Langer for a well composed 87. That left England on 170/2 with Collingwood coming in, looking to continue the good work. There was a period where Collingwood seemed so intent on staying in, he forgot to score. England went into tea at 170/2, having scored 81 runs for 1 wicket in the session.\nEngland came out to the evening session hoping to bat through losing one wicket maximum. Just a few overs in, Collingwood edged one through to the keeper, out for 5 off 36 balls. After that partnership in which 15 runs were scored for 75 balls, England had to bat more aggressively and Pietersen seemed the perfect man to do that for the team. Cook started looking much more confident against Warne and soon he was one run away from his maiden Ashes century, not made easy by Warne but eventually, Cook got the run to bring up a 257-ball 100. The day had belonged firmly to England, but with just three overs left, McGrath took the wicket of Cook, edging behind to Gilchrist, and bowled nightwatchman Hoggard for a second-ball duck. McGrath proceeded to beat Flintoff with the remaining two balls, including an unsuccessful appeal for caught-behind. Flintoff and Pietersen, saw out the remaining overs, leaving England on 265/5.\nEngland started the fifth and final day of the match in an aggressive fashion, which many found surprising. Flintoff, in particular, took the Australian bowlers to task, including striking Clark for three consecutive fours and striking a Lee delivery for six, just inches out of the reach of Hussey, who was fielding at deep mid-wicket.\nPietersen was unusually reserved and was almost run out by some quick reaction fielding from Hussey in the first hour, but was given the benefit of the doubt by the third umpire who eventually gave it not out, much to the delight of the Barmy Army.\nAfter that huge scare for England, Pietersen charged down the pitch and smacked Warne through mid wicket for four, bringing up yet another half-century. Soon after that, Flintoff brought up his half-century with an inside edge and Ponting was starting to look nervous, perhaps considering England could pull off the impossible.\nAustralia finally broke through when Flintoff misjudged the length of a straighter ball from Warne and was bowled. He was quickly followed by Jones; his dismal tour continued when he was run out in astounding fashion. Having failed in an attempt to sweep Warne, Jones was struck on the pad, resulting in an unsuccessful appeal for lbw from the Australians. Jones, however, was too preoccupied waiting for the umpire's verdict to notice that his back foot was out of his batting crease. This fact did not escape an alert Ponting, however, who swooped in from silly point and underarmed the ball into the stumps. Jones was out for a duck – his second of the match.\nThe remaining English batsmen, Harmison, Mahmood and Panesar, offered the Australian bowlers no trouble, with the last man, Panesar, being dismissed by Warne two balls after the lunch break, leaving Warne with 699 career Test wickets leading into the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Pietersen continued a fine tour with relatively subdued 60 not out.\nAttendance for the five days was 103,440, breaking the 1970 record of 84,142.\nThe victory gave Australia an unbeatable 3–0 lead in the best-of-five series.\nFourth Test.\nWeather conditions were poor with heavily overcast skies and patchy showers. Andrew Flintoff won the toss and elected to bat. The start of the first session of play was delayed by 30 minutes due to rain, commencing at 11:00 local time (00:00 UTC). The pitch was green, damp and unpredictable with a lot of seam movement. Although England managed to survive through to lunch at 1/36, Ian Bell fell shortly after the lunch interval to a Stuart Clark lbw. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Strauss appeared to have embarked on a good partnership and brought the score to 2/101. Brett Lee then removed Collingwood with a catch by Ricky Ponting in the slips. Two balls later, Shane Warne took his 700th Test wicket by clean bowling Strauss, who had just reached 50.\nEngland subsequently collapsed and finished all out for 159 with Warne taking a further four wickets. England had lost their final eight wickets for a mere 58 runs. When Australia commenced batting it appeared that Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden might run away with the match, and England's frustration was compounded by the rejection of a number of creditable lbw appeals. However, Flintoff restored considerable confidence when he had Langer and nightwatchman Lee caught behind on successive deliveries in the 10th over. Australia finished the day at 2/48.\nThe morning session was completely dominated by England, who collected the prize wickets of Ponting, Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke for a combined total of 18 runs. Although Hayden had managed to survive despite several strong appeals, Australia looked in severe trouble at 5/84, with the unproven Andrew Symonds coming to the crease. England were, however, unable to capitalise on their advantage, and Hayden and Symonds wrested control of the match back in Australia's favour throughout most of the remaining two sessions. Hayden achieved his century just before tea, and Australia resumed the third session at 5/226. Symonds subsequently achieved his maiden Test century with a powerful six to long on.\nAlthough Hayden fell late in the day for 153, swiftly followed by Adam Gilchrist (for one run), the match appeared close to irretrievable for England. At the close of play, Australia had recovered from 5/85 to reach 7/372 (a lead of 213) with Symonds and Warne still at the crease.\nLike the morning session of the previous day, England initially gave themselves some grounds for optimism. The wicket of Symonds fell early and only Warne provided any resistance as the tail was cleaned up, with Australia all out for 419 (a lead of 260). The originally bowler-friendly pitch appeared to have flattened out considerably, and the total did not appear as imposing as it might have otherwise been. Unfortunately for England the four Australia bowlers gave no quarter, and England went from 0/41 to 3/49 as the pacemen ripped through the top order. The pressure did not relent, and ultimately England succumbed midway through the final session to be all out for a mere 161 runs. The victory margin was an innings and 99 runs, giving Ponting his first innings victory in an Ashes Test, in what was clearly England's poorest performance of the series thus far. Lee recorded his best bowling figures of the series with 4/87. Warne was named Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 5/39 and 2/46, and his resilient 40* with the bat. Warne's dismissal of Steve Harmison was also his 999th international wicket (combining Test and ODI figures), leaving him one shy of becoming only the second player in history to reach the 1,000 milestone (after Muttiah Muralitharan).\nThis was the 100th test match to be played at the MCG. Attendance over the three days totalled 244,351 fans, which is the largest Test crowd for a match of less than five days duration. This included a crowd of 89,155 fans for day one of the fourth Test, a record for the Ashes and also a record for a Boxing Day match at the ground, just shy of the official all-time mark of 90,800 (set at the MCG when Australia played the West Indies during the 1960–61 season).\nFifth Test.\nThe fifth Test at the SCG was the 300th Ashes Test. England made one change to their side from the fourth Test, with James Anderson coming in for Matthew Hoggard, who had suffered a side-strain. Australia named the same side that won in Melbourne. To recognise the careers of retiring Australia players Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, \"Thx Glenn\" and \"Thx Shane\" were painted on the ground in place of the \"mobile\" part of the 3 logos. When Justin Langer also announced his retirement during the match, a \"Thx Justin\" sign was painted on the ground also.\nAs in Melbourne, rain delayed the start in Sydney. When the toss finally came at 11:10 local time (00:10 UTC), England won and captain Andrew Flintoff elected to bat first. Play commenced at 11:40 local time (00:40 UTC). Andrew Strauss was dropped on 21 by Justin Langer, but was out eight runs later to an easy Adam Gilchrist catch off a miscued cut shot against Brett Lee. England reached lunch on 58/1, but Alastair Cook departed for 20 shortly after the restart when he edged a Stuart Clark delivery to Gilchrist.\nKevin Pietersen then joined Ian Bell at the crease and the two batted for nearly all of the middle session, for a partnership of 108 including 70 from Bell. Shortly after tea, with England on 2/166, McGrath took Pietersen's wicket for 41 when he top-edged a pull for a Michael Hussey catch. After Paul Collingwood came to bat, Bell only lasted one more run before McGrath clean bowled him in his next over, leaving England at 4/167. Collingwood (25*) and Flintoff (42*) then steadied matters until bad light forced an early end to the day's affairs.\nPlay started 11 minutes earlier than normal (10:19 local time) to recover some of the time lost on the first day.\nLess than a half-hour in, shortly after Flintoff got his half-century, McGrath took Collingwood's wicket off an edge to Gilchrist. Within 20 minutes, Lee took the wickets of Chris Read for two and Sajid Mahmood for a duck off consecutive balls, reducing England to 257/7. Flintoff and Steve Harmison stayed at the crease for 25 runs before Harmison was given out lbw to Clark. Just before the lunch break, Flintoff fell for 89 after trying to slog Clark but edging to Gilchrist. A clearly out-of-sorts Warne was able to pick up his 1,000th international wicket to end the England innings on 291, trapping Monty Panesar lbw for a duck.\nThe Australian openers Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden started confidently, but Langer faltered on 26, gloving an Anderson ball to Read. Ponting and Hayden found batting easy against a defensive field setting until Hayden played a foolish stroke and top-edged a Harmison ball to Collingwood. Ponting appeared supremely confident against the bowling, but was undone by the fielding when an Anderson throw found him well short of his ground, and he departed for 45. Clarke was then caught behind off a sharply rising Harmison delivery. Symonds and Hussey then batted very defensively during the rain-interrupted remainder of the final session.\nHussey fell in only the second over of the day to a Read catch off Anderson. With this England appeared to have made a contest of it with Australia at 5/190, still trailing by over 100 runs. But, as on so many previous occasions in the series, Australia retaliated in a fearsome manner.\nSymonds and Gilchrist added a steady 70 runs before Symonds saw his stumps tumble to a superb Panesar ball. Warne then joined Gilchrist at the crease and put England's bowling to the sword, with a 58 run partnership in only seven overs, including a four and six off the first two balls Warne faced. Gilchrist was given out caught behind, although replays indicated the decision was a bad one. Lee joined Warne at 7/317 but departed quickly, and Clark then delivered a sparkling tail-ender innings of 35. Warne's fairy-tale dream of a maiden Test century in his final match ended when he was easily stumped after swinging wildly at a Panesar ball, but he had earned the top-scorer mantle with 71, and England found themselves with a deficit of 102.\nThe English second innings began dismally with Cook edging to Gilchrist off Lee with the score only at 5. Hopes were faintly restored when Strauss and Bell appeared to be settling in, but after Clark trapped Strauss lbw and Bell edged Lee to Gilchrist, England were looking fragile at 3/64. Collingwood soon departed cheaply, and Flintoff was sent to the pavilion after an agonizingly close—but fair—stumping decision by the third umpire. Flintoff's dismissal would later prove to be the final wicket of Warne's illustrious Test career. Panesar was then sent in as nightwatchman, and survived to the end of the day.\nAt the end of the day, England were facing the grave prospect of a 5–0 Ashes whitewash after closing a mere 12 runs ahead of Australia with only five wickets remaining.\nWhatever tiny hope England had of taking the match to a fifth day was quashed on the third ball of the first over when Pietersen edged to Gilchrist off McGrath. Poor judgment led to a Panesar run-out for a duck, and England had lost two wickets in the day without scoring a run. Mahmood and Read followed shortly thereafter, and England were 9/123. Anderson and Harmison combined for a valiant 10th wicket stand of 24, before Anderson skied a McGrath delivery to midwicket. The second innings was over, and England had only managed to set a target of 46 runs.\nAustralia's brief second innings was paradoxically the time that England delivered some of the finest bowling of the series. Langer was given a guard of honour by the English team as he walked out to his final innings, but he was then clearly tested by a series of superb rising deliveries from Harmison. Regardless, the match outcome was inevitable, and it was Hayden who lofted a six, followed by a single, to conclude the innings, the match and the series 5–0 whitewash, the first since 1920/21.\nRecords and statistics.\nThe series produced some notable records.\nPost-series.\nThe series was notable for the retirement of Australia's Shane Warne, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn and Glenn McGrath. Additionally, the Australian coach John Buchanan along with McGrath had announced prior to the Ashes series that his retirement would be effective after the ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 series (of one-day internationals), so that the Ashes was his last Test series as coach.\nMajor concern was raised in England after a dramatic capitulation just 15 months after winning the coveted urn. As a result, many criticised Andrew Flintoff's captaincy and the resultant pressure placed on him following Michael Vaughan's injury and his own performances in 2005.\nMedia coverage.\nCoverage of the 2006–07 Ashes series was broadcast as follows:"

Another version of this device is the Reversino, intended for use with thinner ropes.\nA Reverso can be used to belay the leader, one or two seconds, or as a descender during rappelling. It can also be used in self-braking mode, to belay one or two seconds, if attached directly to the belay.\nA Reverso is similar in design and use to an ATC when belaying a lead climber from below. A rope passes through the Reverso, through a carabiner attached to both the Reverso and the belayer's harness, and back through the same hole in the Reverso. This creates the friction required to properly belay a climber.\nWhen belaying a seconder from the top of a climb, the Reverso is attached by a carabiner through the \"extra loop\" that an ATC does not have, to the anchors in the place of an italian hitch knot. Using this method, the device is self-locking, and cannot be released without extra gear."

        "text": "Sid 'Joe' Pearce (7 September 1910 – 16 October 1995) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s. An Australian international and New South Wales representative second-row forward, he played his club football for Eastern Suburbs with whom he won the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1940. Son of fellow Australian Rugby League Hall of Famer, Sandy Pearce, he is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.\nClub career.\nHe was a junior Australian Rules footballer in Sydney's eastern suburbs district but switched to rugby league and first appeared as a full-back for the Tricolours in 1929 before moving into the forwards.\nPearce was an outstanding ball-playing second-rower in the champion Easts' side that saw premiership success in seasons 1935, 1936 and 1937. He had captained the club in 1933 and saw further premiership success with them in 1940.\nRepresentative career.\nHe first represented for New South Wales in 1930 and for the next twelve seasons without fail he played in the interstate series. He debuted for Australia against the touring Great Britain side in 1932. He played in all three Tests of that tour and whilst not a kicker at Easts, booted a conversion in the second Test filling in for Eric Weissel.\nHe was selected on the 1933–34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain led by Frank McMillan and played in 2 Tests and 22 minor matches. He was picked for a second Kangaroo Tour in 1937, played in two matches on the first stanza of the tour to New Zealand where he suffered a broken leg. He did not appear in any further matches of the tour nor again represent for Australia. Pearce appeared for Australia in thirteen Test matches.\nPearce is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 170.\nFather and son.\nLike his father Sandy, Joe played in over 150 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club. They were the first father and son to represent Australia in rugby league. Both players' representative careers were ended by a broken-leg suffered on a Kangaroo tour.\nPearce came from a family of sporting champions. His grandfather Harry, brother Cecil, cousin Bobby and aunt Lilly were renowned scullers (Harry a world champion, Cecil an Olympian and Bobby a dual Olympic gold medalist). His uncle Walter was an outstanding long distance cyclist.\nPost-playing.\nPearce coached Eastern Suburbs in first grade in the 1944 NSWRFL season. During and after his football days he was competitive sailor on Sydney Harbour in the fast 18-foot class.\nHe is recognised as Eastern Suburbs player No. 193.\nAccolades.\nPearce was in 2007 named a member of Easts' greatest ever side – their 'Team of the Century'.\nIn February 2008, Pearce was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In 2007 he was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Lisle's Tennis Court",
        "text": "Lisle's Tennis Court was a building off Portugal Street in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse during two periods, 1661–1674 and 1695–1705. During the early period, the theatre was called Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, also known as The Duke's Playhouse, The New Theatre or The Opera. The building was rebuilt in 1714, and used again as a theatre for a third period, 1714–1732. The tennis court theatre was the first public playhouse in London to feature the moveable scenery that would become a standard feature of Restoration theatres.\nHistorical background.\nThe period beginning in England in 1642 and lasting until 1660 is known as the Interregnum, meaning \"between kings.\" At this time, there was no monarch on the throne, and theatre was against the law. Spanning from 1642 to 1649, the English Civil War occurred. This war was an uprising against the current King of England, King Charles I, led by Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan. Cromwell's opposition to the throne was religious but political, as well, which led him to build up an army with the ability to imprison King Charles, who was beheaded in 1649, ending the war. After his death, the King's wife and children were given permission to leave the country, so they travelled to France to escape and receive protection. \nThe years following became known as the Commonwealth Era (1649–1660) because Cromwell, who established himself as the monarch figure without assuming any official authority, ruled the nation with Parliament support and renamed the England Republic to the English Commonwealth. These were tough times for England as Cromwell persecuted many families, especially those who fought on the behalf of King Charles I and Irish families that held rustic Catholic beliefs. Needless to say, Oliver Cromwell quickly fell out of the majority's favour, and he died in 1658 of natural causes. Two years later, Charles II, the beheaded king's son, returned to England and began the Restoration by restoring the throne and claiming his role as the proper King of England. \nIn addition, King Charles II's return restored the legality of theatre. This history is significant because it explains that since Charles II spent most of his life in France, he, as King, appreciated French culture, which prominently impressed upon England during the Restoration, particularly Restoration theatre.\nStructure.\nThere are no extant photos, elaborate diagrams, paintings, or other forms of visual evidence of the inside of the Lincoln's Inn theatre, but certain aspects are understood of the theatre according to its time period. However, a great example of the layout of the inside is the Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, North Yorkshire, which contains components of Restoration theatre spaces and still stands today. Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse was very small. In fact, Milhous believes that \"the smaller seating capacity… hurt the [Duke’s] company in the long run\" as they moved as newer theatres came along (Milhous 71). It was around 75 feet long by 30 feet wide with about a 650-person audience seating maximum capacity (The Restoration Theater; Wilson and Goldfarb 249). It was originally an indoor tennis court; courts were used as theatre spaces because they had a similar structure with a narrow, rectangular shape and gallery seating. The stage was raked, sloping upward toward the back of the stage, in order to help with perspective. The audience was divided into the pit, boxes, and galleries. The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. Boxes sat upper class aristocrats—mostly married couples with wives who wanted to be seen. Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. \nThe English stage, unlike French or Italian theatres, had a very deep apron to provide adequate acting space, and the background and perspective scenery served as solely as scenery. The Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse orchestra was housed beneath the stage, and the apron was extended two feet to cover completely the orchestra pit and obtain close proximity between the actors and the audience, creating an intimate atmosphere. Another uniqueness of English theatres is that there were typically two pairs of doors, one on each side of the stage, called proscenium doors with balconies above them for the actors to utilize in performances. Proscenium doors served as entrances and exits disregarding the possibility of multiple locations. Candelabras provided light for the space, and manual moveable scenery was used to move the show along (The Restoration Theater).\nThe Duke's Company.\nThe building was constructed as a real tennis court in 1656. Thomas Lisle's wife Anne Tyler and a man named James Hooker developed the indoor court in the winter of 1656 and 1657. Tudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions — about 75 by 30 feet — are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.\nAfter the English Restoration in 1660, Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse received its first company through the efforts of the King himself and two men who dedicated themselves to theatre. Sir William Davenant had received a patent from Charles the I in 1639 when he was in power, but he had never used it due to the theatre ban. When theatre was restored, Davenant and a man named Thomas Killigrew wanted to create theatre in England and thus, Killigrew obtained a warrant expressing that he could \"raise a company and a theatre, provided that his company and Davenant's should be the only ones allowed to play in London\" (Hotson 199). Davenant, then, drafted their joint warrant and after much debate over whether or not their role in theatre infringed on the Master of the Revels' power, they appealed to Charles II. Charles II determined their Letters of Patent were valid and created two companies to perform \"legitimate drama\" in London: the Duke's Company of his brother, The Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and his company, the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Original intentions were positive, but competition was quickly apparent between the two. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and Salisbury Court), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Taking a hint from their new King's taste, Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres.\nIn March 1660, Sir William Davenant contracted to lease Lisle's Tennis Court in order to renovate it into a theatre, and he bought adjoining land to expand the building into the garden area. Killigrew's theatre on Vere Street (Gibbon's Tennis Court) opened first, in November 1660. Davenant apparently spent more time in his remodelling: Lincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first \"moveable\" or \"changeable\" scenery used on the British public stage, and the first proscenium arch. Wings or shutters ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\" where the soon-to-be famous actor, Thomas Betterton, performed the prologue. The result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time. This production at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse \"emptied Killigrew's theatre\" according to Milhous (19). Milhous also explains that the companies and other theatres \"deliberately engaged in vicious head-on collision[s], mounting the same plays\" (19). The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as diarist and devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys notes on 4 July:\nI went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw \"Claracilla\" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.\n\"The Siege of Rhodes\" \"continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause\" according to the prompter John Downes in his \"historical review of the stage\" \"Roscius Anglicanus\" (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. More acclaimed productions by the Duke's Company \"with scenes\" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including \"Hamlet\" and \"Twelfth Night\"), all highly admired by Pepys.\nThe King's Company was forced to abandon their own, technically unsophisticated tennis-court theatre and commission the construction of a new theatre in Bridges Street, where the Theatre Royal opened in 1663.\nPrince Cosimo III of Tuscany visited the Lisle theatre in 1669, and his official diarist left us this account:\n[The pit] is surrounded within by separate compartments in which there are several degrees [steps] of seating for the greater comfort of the ladies and gentlemen who, according to the liberal custom of the country, share the same boxes. Down below [in the pit] there remains a broad space for other members of the audience. The scenery is entirely changeable, with various transformations and lovely perspectives. Before the play begins, to render the waiting less annoying and inconvenient, there are very graceful instrumental pieces to be heard, with the result that many go early just to enjoy this part of the entertainment.\nThe theatre was implicated by the Grand Jury of Middlesex on 7 July 1703 for showcasing \"profane, irrelevant, lewd, indecent, and immoral expressions\". It was also a hot target for riots and disorderly assemblies, murders, and other misdemeanors, but despite its troubles, the theatre remained very popular including hosting the first paid performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1700 and Handel's final two operas (Pedicord 41).\nDavenant died in 1668 and the Duke's Company, now under Thomas Betterton, performed out of Lincoln's Inns Fields until 1671, when they relocated to the elaborate new Dorset Garden Theatre which was more popular at the time. In 1672, the theatre in Bridges Street burnt down, and the King's Company temporarily occupied the recently vacated Lincoln's Inn Field, until their new theatre opened in 1674.\nBetterton and Rich.\nThe building was converted back to a tennis court and remained one for almost 20 years. During that time, the Duke's Company, occupying the Dorset Theatre, subsumed the King's Company, housed in the newly rebuilt Theatre Royal, to form the United Company, performing out of Drury Lane. Betterton, a famous English actor, was forced out as the head of the company in 1688, staying on as an actor (and filling a day-to-day managerial role) while a succession of leaders embezzled funds and cut costs by cutting actors' salaries. This uniting created many conflicts between the members of the companies. For example, each company would have one actor who would always play Hamlet, but when the companies are combined, who claims the role? Due to rivalry and competition within the United Company, Thomas Betterton petitioned to the king to separate and create his own company. So, under Christopher Rich, the United Company split. Betterton left with a band of actors and a newly issued license to perform, and from 1695 to 1705 his company performed back at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, refurbishing the abandoned building back into a theatre. The New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields opened in April 1695 with William Congreve's \"Love for Love\". It was later the first venue for Congreve's plays \"The Mourning Bride\" (1697) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700) and for Vanbrugh's comedy \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697).\nThe building went unused as a theatre from 1705 until it was refurbished again in 1714. Colley Cibber in his \"Apology\" wrote that Christopher Rich “rebuilt that Theatre from the Ground, as it is now standing”. This has led to the belief that Rich demolished the entire building. If the structure was sound, this would have been unnecessary, time-consuming and expensive, especially as Cibber adds that Rich did it at his own expense. It is far more likely that it was merely the interior that was rebuilt, and Cibber's text has been misinterpreted. Supporting evidence for this comes from the first issue of the British Journal on 22 September 1722 which reported that a fresco of Betterton, with other theatre figures of the period, had been uncovered during redecoration of the theatre. Rich also had no guarantee that he would receive a licence for the theatre, and would have kept costs to a minimum. As it turned out, he was able to take advantage of the accession of George 1st in August 1714 to obtain the necessary permission. Christopher Rich died in November 1714, but his son John Rich led a company at the theatre until 1728. On 29 January 1728, Rich's theatre hosted the first, very successful, production of John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" (making \"Rich gay and Gay rich\"). The theatre was abandoned in December 1732, when the company moved to the new Covent Garden Theatre, built by Rich using the capital generated by \"The Beggar's Opera\". A few years later Henry Giffard moved his company from Goodman's Fields at a time when he was trying to establish a third major theatre company in London. The Licensing Act 1737 largely dashed these hopes, although he continued to stage plays at Lincoln's Inn for several more years.\nThe old building was subsequently used as a barracks, an auction room, a warehouse for china, and was finally demolished in 1848 to make room for an extension to the neighbouring premises of the Royal College of Surgeons."

He served as head coach at Braehead Clan until March 2018.\nTripp played 43 games in the National Hockey League for the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings, before continuing his career in Germany.\nPlaying career.\nTripp was originally drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the third round, 77th overall, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He re-entered the draft two years later and was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the second round, 42nd overall. Despite being drafted by two different teams, both times fairly high in the draft selection, he would not see NHL level playing time until the 2002–03 season when he played nine games for the New York Rangers. The next season, 2003–04, Tripp played 34 games for the Los Angeles Kings.\nIn 2004, during the NHL lockout, Tripp moved to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany for Adler Mannheim. In 2006, he moved to ERC Ingolstadt before heading to the Hamburg Freezers in 2007. In this time Tripp was able to obtain German citizenship and represent Germany internationally.\nAfter three seasons with the Freezers, Tripp left and signed an initial try-out contract with fellow German based club, the Hannover Scorpions on September 22, 2010. After three weeks John was released by the Scorpions but immediately signed a one-year contract for the remainder of the 2010–11 season with Kölner Haie on October 19, 2010. He then remained with the Haie team through the 2014-15 season, serving as team captain between 2011 and 2015.\nTripp played 11 seasons in the top flight DEL, before signing a one-year contract with second tier based, Eispiraten Crimmitschau of the DEL2 on September 8, 2015.\nInternational play.\nTripp won 110 caps for the German national team between 2006 and 2014, scoring 28 goals and assisting on 15 more.

His team had to go into the relegation round, where they overcame Rosenheim which allowed the Crimmitschau club to remain in the league. Tripp and the team parted ways after the conclusion of the 2016-17 season.\nIn May 2017, Tripp agreed a deal to become the new head coach of Braehead Clan in the UK's EIHL. He guided the Clan to a ninth-place finish in the regular season, his tenure ended in late March 2018. Tripp returned to his native Canada and started the Kingston Hockey Academy.\nMedia career.\nSince January 2016, Tripp has been serving as co-host and analyst of CHL Centre Ice, a show dedicated to the Champions Hockey League (CHL), and as color commentator of CHL games. He was a member of the TSN broadcast crew at the 2017 IIHF World Championships.\nPersonal life.\nHe has been friends since his childhood with Jayna Hefford; both went to the same school.\nTripp's maternal grandparents immigrated from Germany to Canada in 1953. His nickname is Hans, after his German grandfather. Tripp is married to Taryn Turnbull, a former basketball player at Tulane University and in the German second division. His brother-in-law, Stuart Turnbull, played professional basketball in Germany.\nA cancer survivor himself, he founded Tripp Charity to raise money and awareness for children battling cancer."

        "text": "Edward Peter Murray (born August 29, 1956) is a Canadian former professional football player who was a kicker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings and Washington Redskins. He played college football at Tulane University.\nEarly years.\nMurray grew up in Victoria, British Columbia, and attended Spectrum Community School, where he practiced soccer, track, cricket and rugby, although it didn't have an American football team. \nAfter graduation, he spent a year working with a fork lift in a lumber yard. He played junior football for the Saanich Hornets of the Lower Island Junior Varsity League. He was discovered by Tulane University at a camp run by Canadian football coach Cal Murphy.\nCollege career.\nMurray accepted a football scholarship to attend Tulane University. As a sophomore, he was named the starter at placekicker, making 12-of-22 field goals (54.5%), 11-of-13 extra points (84.6%). As a junior, he posted 12-of-18 field goals (68.8%) and 21-of-21 extra points (100%).\nAs a senior, he tallied 11-of-16 field goals (68.75%) and 35-for-35 extra points (100%). He finished his college career as the school's record holder in field goals (45), points by a kicker (219), highest field goal percentage (.616) and extra points (84).\nIn 1987, he was inducted into the Tulane University Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Lions.\nMurray was selected by the Detroit Lions in the seventh round (166th overall) of the 1980 NFL draft. He was also selected in the third round (26th overall) of the 1980 CFL Draft by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\nAs a rookie, he replaced veteran kicker Benny Ricardo, making 27-of-42 field goals (64.3%) and 35-of-36 extra points (97.2%). After winning the NFC scoring title with 116 points and setting a franchise record with 27 field goals, he was named to the Pro Bowl where he made 5 field goals and became the only rookie to ever receive the MVP award for the game.\nIn 1981, he made a last-minute field goal to beat the Dallas Cowboys. The play was memorable for the fact that the Lions were able to execute the kick without a huddle and out of a non-kicking formation.\nIn 1983, he made the longest field goal in Lions history (54 yards). In the NFC Divisional Playoff at San Francisco, with the Lions trailing 24-23 with 11 seconds left in the game, Murray, having earlier made a 54-yard field goal (an NFL playoff record at the time), narrowly missed a 43-yard attempt that sealed a 23-24 loss.\nIn 1985, he set a franchise record with 12 straight field goals. The next year, he set the franchise single-season record with 684 points. In 1988, he was a Pro Bowl alternate.\nIn 1988 and 1989, he tied an NFL record for the highest field goal accuracy in a season (95.24%).\nMurray led the team in scoring in each of his first 10 seasons until 1990, when a hip injury kept him out of 5 games and prevented him from leading the team in scoring for the first time in his career, with Barry Sanders being first.\nOn April 29, 1992, he was waived to make room for second round draft choice Jason Hanson. He left as the franchise's All-time leading scorer, ranking 17th in NFL history and was the ninth Lion to have played in 12 seasons.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn October 24, 1992, he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs to play one game in place of an injured Nick Lowery. He was released on October 28.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn November 10, 1992, he was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to replace a struggling Ken Willis. He made 4-of-8 field goals (50%) and 13-of-13 (100%) extra points.\nIn 1993, he had an excellent training camp, but the team decided to keep undrafted free agent Michael Husted, who displayed a stronger leg in kickoffs. He was released on August 23.\nDallas Cowboys (first stint).\nOn September 14, 1993, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys after a 0-2 start to replace a struggling Lin Elliott. Against the Green Bay Packers, he tied a franchise mark with 5 field goals made in a single-game. Against the Minnesota Vikings, he set a franchise record with 2 field goals made over 50 yards. His 3 field goals over 50 yards in a single-season tied for second in club history.\nIn just 14 games, he had the best season of his career, making 27 out of 32 field goal attempts (122 points) in the regular season and all 6 in the playoffs. He set a club mark by making 28 field goals. He ranked second in franchise history with 122 points in a single season, 10 consecutive field goals made and an 84.8% field goal average in a single-season.\nMurray made a game-winning field goal in overtime in the regular season finale against the New York Giants, which determined the NFC East Title and NFC home field advantage throughout the playoffs. On January 30, 1994, he kicked three field goals in Super Bowl XXVIII, earning a Super Bowl ring as a member of the champion Cowboys.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn March 23, 1994, he was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles to replace kicker Roger Ruzek. He made 21-of-25 field goals (84%) and 33-of-33 extra points (100%). On July 22, 1995, he was released to make room for placekicker Gary Anderson.\nWashington Redskins (first stint).\nOn August 8, 1995, he was signed by the Washington Redskins to replace a struggling Chip Lohmiller. He was re-signed on May 15, 1996. He was released on August 25, after being passed on the depth chart by Scott Blanton.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nOn September 24, 1997, he was signed by the Minnesota Vikings after being out of football for a year, to replace kicker Greg Davis. He made 12-of-17 field goals (70.6%) and 23-of-24 extra points (95.8%), highlighted by his game-winning field goal in the closing seconds to cap off a 23-22 comeback win over the Giants in the Wild Card. He wasn't re-signed after the season and was replaced with Gary Anderson.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn June 2, 1999, he signed a one-day contract to retire with the Detroit Lions.\nDallas Cowboys (second stint).\nOn December 9, 1999, he was signed and brought out of retirement by the Dallas Cowboys after being out of football for over a year, to replace Richie Cunningham. He appeared in 4 games, making 7-of-9 field goals (77.8%) and 10-of-10 extra points (100%). He wasn't re-signed after the season and was replaced with Tim Seder.\nWashington Redskins (second stint).\nOn November 9, 2000, he was signed by the Washington Redskins as part of a revolving door of kickers and at the time was the league's oldest player. He struggled during the season and missed 2 game-winning field goal attempts, the latter of which a 49-yard attempt to beat the Super Bowl-bound Giants in Week 14 that landed short. He wasn't re-signed and retired as the 16th highest scorer in NFL history. His 250 career NFL games set the record for a Canadian-born player, which was broken by long snapper L.P. Ladouceur in 2020.\nCareer regular season statistics.\n\"Career high/best bolded\"\nPersonal life.\nMurray currently resides in Michigan with his wife Cynthia and daughter Nicole."

Their first first-class match was against Gentlemen of England at Lord's in 1920, while their last was against Oxford University at Aldershot in 1964. Combined Services have continued to play cricket thereafter, albeit at minor level.\nHistory.\nThey played only six first-class matches prior to World War II, but a further 57 afterwards, when the individual services had ceased to play at first-class level (apart from two matches by the Royal Air Force immediately after the War). Of these 63 matches, they won 7 (5 of them between 1946 and 1949), lost 34 and drew 22.\nIn the 1950s, most young men had to do two years National Service in one of the armed forces, so that Combined Services was able to field some reasonably strong sides. For example, in the 1951 match against the touring South Africans the side included Brian Close, who had already played for England, and Jim Parks, Fred Titmus and Alan Moss, who would all go on to do so. In one of the later matches against Warwickshire at the Mitchells and Butlers' Ground in Birmingham, the county fast-medium bowler Jack Bannister took all 10 Services wickets in an innings for 41 runs.\nThe Combined Services team continues to play at sub-first-class level."

        "title": "Comparison of American football and rugby league",
        "text": "A comparison between American football and rugby league is possible because of their shared origins and similar game concepts. Rugby league is arguably the most similar sport to American football after Canadian football: both sports involve the concept of a limited number of downs/tackles and scoring touchdowns/tries takes clear precedence over goal-kicking.\nGenerally, American football games last much longer than 80-minute rugby league matches. Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower-paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while backward passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal. Rugby league footballers have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply have possession of the ball as it crosses the plane of the goal-line, or receive a forward pass while in the end zone.\nAmerican football requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft headgear (hard helmets being illegal). The playing fields of both sports are similar in size with a rugby league playing field being long while an American football field is long.\nOrigins.\nBoth sports descend from the older game of rugby football, which originated in 19th Century England. British colonists and the British military in Canada brought football to North America. It became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At the time, association football and rugby football were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing each game. The sports of American football and Canadian football evolved from these intercollegiate games.\nMeanwhile, in England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, rugby league, which permitted player payments. At first, the two rugby codes differed only in how they were administered; over time, their playing rules diverged to the point that they are now distinctly different forms of football.\nThe field.\nAmerican football is played on a rectangular field long by 53 1⁄3 yards (48.8 m) wide. Near each end of the field is a \"goal line\", which are apart. A scoring area called an end zone extends beyond each goal line. Yard lines cross the field every , two rows of hash marks run parallel to the side lines near the middle of the field. At the back of each of the end zones, there are a set of goalposts. American football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet (5.6 m) apart (24 feet (7.3 m) in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of 10 feet (3.0 m), resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line.\nA rugby league field has very similar dimensions, being up to long and wide. Lines cross the field marking every . The goal posts are situated on the goal line and are therefore separated by exactly . The area beyond each goal post, known as the \"in-goal area\", extends for another . In rugby league, the goal posts are usually H-shaped, each post being high and apart, with the cross bar being high. American football \"tuning fork\" goal posts are allowed in rugby league, provided the posts and cross bar are at the required dimensions. The goal posts are used for other forms of point scoring in rugby league: drop goals or field goals, penalty goals and conversions.\nPlayers.\nAs four replacements in a rugby league team, with only twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game (eight in the Australian NRL). If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play short handed. All players must attack and defend and there is no equivalent of special teams.\nPrior to the 1960s, and in arena football (an indoor variant of the American game) from 1988 to 2007, American football did use a one-platoon system in which most players were required to play all facets of the game, severely limiting substitution, much as rugby league (and most other sports) continue to do. Most levels of American football abolished the one-platoon system in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although college football re-implemented it for a short time in the 1950s and 1960s.\nBroadly speaking, offensive and defensive linemen in American football correspond to forwards in rugby league and other players are somewhat similar to backs. Basically the job of the forwards in rugby league is to get the ball over the advantage line and give the backs space and a chance to be creative and move the ball around, which will hopefully result in points. However, rugby league footballers are far less specialised than American football players.\nMany of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. A fullback in American football is very different from a fullback in rugby league. However, some of the positions are fairly similar: for instance, the stand-off/five-eighth and halfback carry out a similar role to a quarterback in American football.\nAdvancing the ball.\nIn American football, the team that's in possession of the ball (the offense) has four \"downs\", to advance the ball 10 yards towards the end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball.\nA down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:\nThis closely resembles the six-tackle rule in rugby league. Originally, tackles were unlimited in rugby league, as they are in the related sport of rugby union. As this could result in long periods with one team in possession of the ball, in 1966 the game's administrators implemented the limited tackle rule from American football. At first, the number of tackles was set at four, as in American football; it was later extended to six to give teams more time to develop attacking play. After six tackles, the team with the ball has to hand over possession to the opposing team. A key difference with American football is that there is no automatic way of earning a new set of tackles in rugby league. Each set is effectively a chance to score, with failure to do so resulting in relinquishing possession. Another major difference is that play stops briefly when the player in possession of the ball is tackled as it resumes as soon as he gets to his feet and returns the ball to play.\nPlayers can advance the ball in two ways in American football:\nIn rugby league the ball cannot be passed forward, so players can advance the ball by either running with it, or kicking it ahead and chasing it. This concept is preserved in American football; any player may pass the ball backwards, regardless of player position and location of the field. In addition, a ball passed backwards remains live, even if not caught, so long as it remains in play, similar to rugby league.\nFollowing a down, the ball is returned to play within a restricted time limit by a \"snap\" in American Football. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the center, then passes (or \"snaps\") the ball back between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback and play commences.\nIn rugby league the ball is returned to play following a tackle via the \"play the ball\", in which the tackled player gets back to his feet and rolls the ball back to a teammate, usually the hooker. The tackled player will usually try to return to the ball to play as quickly as possible before the defensive line can re-form.\nPossession may change in different ways in both games:-\nIn both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. However, kicking in general play is more common in rugby league. Kicking is far more heavily restricted in American football; the rules currently prohibit a player from kicking the ball after he has crossed the line of scrimmage, whereas a rugby league footballer can kick the ball at any time, from any point on the field. In rugby league, a player can receive a kick (and still maintain possession) if he is behind the kicker at the time of the kick; that feature is not allowed in the American game, except in the onside kick scenario described above.\nPassing.\nIn American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby league.\nThe ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby league. The lateral is most commonly seen on plays at the very end of the game when a team needing a touchdown with only time on the clock for one more play attempts to avoid being tackled by passing to any teammate behind him that may advance the ball. A common trick play called the hook and ladder combines the two - a short forward pass is thrown, with the player catching the pass immediately throwing a lateral to a trailing teammate who is hopefully unnoticed by defensive players. Laterals are also seen in \"pitch\" or \"pitchout\" plays, where the quarterback tosses the ball to a back behind him, rather than handing it off.\nThere is also a minor distinction in what constitutes a forward or backward pass in the two sports. In rugby league (as in rugby union), a pass is considered forward (and thus illegal) if the person catching the ball is ahead of the player throwing it. In American football, a pass is considered forward only if the path of the ball itself has a forward component to it. For instance, the Music City Miracle (a play in which the receiving end of a lateral pass was ahead of the person throwing it, but the path was not forward) was a legal lateral in American football but would have been an illegal forward pass had it been attempted in rugby.\nIn both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands.\nTackles and blocks.\nIn both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. Play then restarts from the next down or tackle. In rugby league, it is common for the player in possession to 'off-load' the ball, passing out of the tackle (before forward progress is halted) in order not to use up a tackle and to keep the play alive. This is much less common in American football, where the lateral pass is most commonly used as a desperation strategy when trailing near the end of a game.\nIn American football, as a tactic within an offensive play, designated offensive position players are assigned to 'block' defensive players, by projecting the front of their body forward into the front or side of the defensive player, in order to impede the ability of the defensive player to tackle the ball carrier. A complicated set of rules, however well-understood by the players, coaches and officials, determines the legality of the block. Illegal blocks, when observed by the officials, are flagged for penalties that vary in their severity, depending upon the particular infraction. Blocks are not permitted in rugby league and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.\nScoring.\nA touchdown is the American football equivalent of rugby league's try. Despite the names, a try requires the ball to be 'touched down' to the ground, whereas a touchdown doesn't. In American football it is sufficient for the player carrying the ball to cause the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) while still in bounds, by carrying it in or holding the ball in or through the imaginary plane of the goal line. In rugby league the ball must be pressed to the ground in the in-goal area. An American football touchdown scores six points and a rugby league try is worth four points.\nIn both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an extra point or a \"point after touchdown\" (PAT) in the NFL (worth 1 point); in rugby league it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). There are two key differences between an extra point and a conversion: conversions cannot be charged down like an extra point attempt and they must be taken from the same position as the try was scored. Hence, it is important to score under the posts rather than in the corner, which makes for a difficult kick. Rugby league has no equivalent to American football's two-point conversion, in which the scoring team chooses not to kick at goal, but attempt a second touchdown from short range.\nIn American football teams often opt to attempt a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby league equivalent, also called a field goal, is worth only one point and is much less common. The key difference between a field goal in the two sports is that an American football field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby league the field goal is attempted using a drop-kick.\nA similar concept in rugby league is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 2 points in league. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground and may be held by a teammate (although almost never is), but it cannot be charged down. The nearest equivalent in American football is the rarely used fair catch kick.\nAmerican football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby league. If a ball carrier is tackled in their own endzone (in-goal area) with the ball or steps out the back of the end zone with the ball, this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the opposing team. In rugby league this does not result in any points but causes the team in possession to kick the ball back to the opposition from under the posts.\nCross Code Matches.\nAt least one cross-code match between American football and rugby league has been played. On August 1, 2009 the Jacksonville Axemen of the AMNRL played the Jacksonville Knights of the Florida Football Alliance. The first half was played under American football rules, the second half was played under rugby league rules. The score at half-time was Jacksonville Axemen 6 - Jacksonville Knights 27. The final score was Jacksonville Axemen 38 - Jacksonville Knights 27."

        "text": "Kevin Joseph Sweeney (born November 16, 1963) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Fresno State Bulldogs.\nEarly years.\nSweeney attended Bullard High School, where he was a standout quarterback. As a senior, he broke Pat Haden's state record for touchdown passes in a season with 35 and received Northern California offensive player of the year honors.\nHis older brother Jim was recruiting him for the University of Washington, while his father Jim Sweeney was doing the same for Fresno State University.\nCollege career.\nSweeney accepted a scholarship from Fresno State University to be coached by his father and replace at quarterback the graduated Jeff Tedford. He worked with Steve DeBerg, whom he credited with helping him most with his throwing motion.\nHe was a four-year starter, played in 46 contests and missed only one half of a game in his career, even playing as a senior with a left dislocated shoulder that required surgery at the end of the season.\nAs a sophomore, he passed for 3,259 yards and 20 touchdowns, leading the nation's highest scoring offense (39.1 points per game). The next year, he threw for 2,604 yards and 14 touchdowns, while helping his team finish as the only Division I unbeaten school (11-0-1). He also had a career long 95-yard touchdown pass against Oregon State University.\nAs a senior, he had the lowest interception percentage (2.37) among the top 25 rated passers and set a conference mark with a career-high 4 touchdown passes against New Mexico State University. He became the NCAA most prolific passer after breaking Doug Flutie's record for passing yards in a career (10,623 yards).\n He shared the NCAA mark for most games of 200 or more passing yards (31), had the conference's career records for touchdowns (66) and completions (781).\nCollege statistics.\nIn 2000, the school retired his number 9 jersey. In 2002, he was inducted into the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nSweeney was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (180th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft, after dropping because of his height. It was also a type of homecoming, as he was a ballboy at the Cowboys' Thousand Oaks training camp growing up. He couldn't pass Paul McDonald on the depth chart and was waived on September 7.\nAfter the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. In September, he was re-signed to be a part of the Dallas Cowboys replacement team, that was given the mock name \"Rhinestone Cowboys\" by the media. In his first game against the New York Jets, he became the third ever rookie quarterback to start for the Cowboys, following Don Meredith (1960) and Roger Staubach (1969). In the second game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he only played in the first half, giving way to Danny White and Loren Snyder in the second half of a 41-22 win. His 77-yard touchdown pass to Cornell Burbage against the Eagles was the team's longest completion of the season. When White took over the team for the third replacement game against the Washington Redskins, the crowd started chanting \"We Want Sweeney, We Want Sweeney\" when the team didn't perform well in the eventual 13-7 loss. He was a very popular player with the fans during those games; accounting for 291 passing yards, 4 touchdown passes, 20.8 yards per completion, one interception, 2 wins and a 109.3 rating in passing efficiency (led all replacement players). He was kept on the roster for the rest of the year.\nIn 1988, he was the third-string quarterback behind White and Steve Pelluer. On November 6, he started the second half and passed for three touchdowns against the New York Giants. The next game, he was given the opportunity to start against the Minnesota Vikings, but lost 43-3 after completing just 10 of 28 passes for 93 yards, with 2 interceptions and 2 fumbles.\nIn 1989, with the arrival of new head coach Jimmy Johnson and with the team also intending to draft a quarterback, he was left unprotected in Plan B free agency.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn March 27, 1989, Sweeney signed with the San Francisco 49ers as a Plan B free agent. He was released before the start of the season on August 26.\nMontreal Machine (WLAF).\nIn 1991, he signed with the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football, where he was named the starter at quarterback, before being passed on the depth chart by Michael Proctor. He played in 10 games, making 24 completions out of 69 attempts for 219 yards, one touchdown and 3 interceptions.\nPersonal life.\nSweeney is a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Bank."

        "title": "1925 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1925 Tour de France was the 19th edition of the Tour de France. It was held from 21 June to 19 July, over in 18 stages. Italian Ottavio Bottecchia successfully defended his 1924 victory to win his second consecutive Tour. Only 49 of the 130 participants finished the course.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1919 to 1924, the sponsored teams had been away because of the economic impact of World War I. In 1925, the teams returned.\nFor the first time, the Tour de France started outside Paris, in le Vésinet. The number of stages increased from 15, which had been used since 1910, to 18, thereby decreasing the average stage length.\nThe time bonus, given to the winner of a stage, was removed.\nAfter Henri Pélissier had created a controversy by quitting the 1924 Tour de France and complaining on the toughness of the race to a journalist, the Tour organisation made a new rule that said that any rider that harmed the Tour's image would be banned for the next years.\nTeams.\nThe participants were divided into two groups: 39 cyclists were riding in sponsored teams, and 91 rode as \"touriste-routiers\". The teams did not have equal size; the largest team, J.B. Louvet, consisted of eight cyclists, while the smallest team, J.Alavoine-Dunlop, had only one cyclist, Jean Alavoine himself. There were 57 French, 34 Belgian, 28 Italian, 5 Swiss, 5 Luxembourgian and 1 Spanish cyclists.\nRace overview.\nBottecchia, who had won the previous Tour de France, started by winning the first stage. In 1924, he had had no difficulty in defending his lead, but in 1925 there was Adelin Benoit, who surprisingly took over the lead in the third stage. Bottecchia was however only eight seconds behind in the general classification.\nIn the fourth stage, Henri Pélissier, the winner of the 1923 Tour de France, left the race. In previous years, Pélissier had left the race after a fight with tour organiser Henri Desgrange, but this time it was because of knee problems.\nIn the sixth stage, Benoit punctured, and Bottechia's Automoto team rode as fast as they could to get away from Benoit. Bottecchia won the stage, and after he won the next stage too, he took over the lead.\nIn the eighth stage, Adelin Benoit won back eleven minutes in the first Pyrenees stage, in what used to be Bottecchia's specialty. In the ninth stage, Bottecchia took back the lead in the rain, and this decided the race. Bottecchia did not win the stage, but his Automoto teammates had helped him to win 45 minutes on Benoit. After that stage, Nicolas Frantz was number two, more than 13 minutes behind.\nIn the next stages, Bottecchia was helped by his teammate Lucien Buysse. In return, Bottecchia allowed Buysse to win the eleventh and twelfth stage. In the twelfth stage, Bottecchia and Buysse failed to sign in at a control post, and were fined with 10 minutes penalty time. Nonetheless, the margin with runner-up Frantz had increased to 27 minutes.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Frantz had a flat tyre, and the Automoto team raced away from him. Frantz lost more than 37 minutes. This took Frantz completely out of contention for the victory, and Bottecchia's victory seemed secure. Italian Aimo was the new runner-up, with a margin of more than 55 minutes. Lucien Buysse was only three minutes behind Aimo, and in the sixteenth stage, Buysse took off, trying to win back time on Aimo. Nicolas Frantz, Albert Dejonghe and Hector Martin followed him, but Aimo missed that move, and lost five minutes. Buysse was now in second place, with Frantz only three seconds behind him.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Frantz missed the deciding escape, and Buysse and Aimo finished in the leading group, so Aimo was back in third place.\nBottecchia made his Tour victory complete by winning the last stage.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nIn 1925, no French cyclist finished in the top ten. For the first time, two of the three riders on the podium were Italian.\nOther classifications.\nThe race for \"touriste-routiers\", cyclists who did not belong to a team and were allowed no assistance, was won by Despontin.\nThe organing newspaper, l'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Bottecchia.\nAftermath.\nThe 1925 Tour de France was Bottecchia's last great victory. In 1926 he started again, but withdrew in the Pyrenees. When he was training in 1927, he was found bleeding at the side of the road close to his house, and he died some hours later.\nThe champion of the 1923 Tour de France, Henri Pélissier, rode his last Tour de France in 1925.\nDuring the race, Bottecchia had promised Lucien Buysse half his earnings, because he needed help. Buysse was content with this deal, and did not try to win the Tour himself. After the race ended, Buysse told his relatives that he was happy with how things went, but that the next year he would try and win the race, which he did."

        "text": "Fabian Joseph Charles McCarthy (24 June 1919 – 5 December 2008) was an Australian rugby union footballer who played for GPS and Toowoomba, represented Queensland at a state level, and the Wallabies at an international level.\nRugby Union career.\nMcCarthy played his first club rugby match in 1947 at the age of 27. After just one season he was selected for the state team and the following year he represented the national team. Former Queensland manager, Tom Blue, described McCarthy, along with Paul Costello as the \"finds of the tour\" following his first tour of New South Wales with the Queensland team in 1948.\nMcCarthy was regarded as a hard rucking, tireless forward who displayed plenty of strength and vigour during his games against New South Wales. He earned his place on the Australian rugby union team and toured New Zealand in 1949. McCarthy was amongst an impressive Australian pack including, Col Windon, Keith Cross, Dave Brockhoff, Sir Nick Shehadie, Rex Mossop, Bevan Wilson, Nev Cottrell, and Jack Baxter. Captained by Trevor Allan, the Australian team of 1949 defeated the All Blacks in both tests and lost only one of its twelve games.\nMcCarthy continued to display excellent form throughout the 1950 season. Max Hawkins wrote that McCarthy played \"the game of his career\" against the Western District. Hawkins continued his praise of McCarthy by writing that \"he proved in Sydney that he is the finest tight forward playing in Australia today\". Former Queensland manager-coach, Joe French, described McCarthy's game against the Western Districts as \"one of the greatest forward efforts he had ever seen\".\nMcCarthy was selected to play in the first test against the British Isles in 1950. Captain Trevor Allan was forced to pull out of the Australian team two days before playing the first test match due to a thigh muscle injury. He was replaced by Nev Cotrell who led the team into what proved to be a bitter blow for the Australians. The Wallabies lost the first test by 19 points to 6. Welsh fullback, Lewis Jones, scored an impressive 16 of the team's 19 points. McCarthy retired from rugby union in 1950 but continued to play rugby league locally until 1956. "

        "title": "List of Olympic medalists in triathlon",
        "text": "Triathlon has been an Olympic sport since its debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Its inclusion in the Summer Olympic Games program was the quickest of any sport: the International Triathlon Union (ITU) was founded in 1989 and five years later, on 4 September 1994, triathlon's Olympic status was approved by the 103rd International Olympic Committee Session, in Paris. The variant contested at the Olympics (called \"Olympic distance\") is composed of a swim, followed by a bicycle race, and a final run leg. The distances were chosen based on the resulting format to be a challenge for participants (sprint triathletes as well as endurance competitors) and entertaining for spectators all over the world.\nFrom 2000, the triathlon competition consisted of a men's and a women's event. A third event, the mixed medley relay involving four triathletes each covering the sprint distance, was introduced in 2021. The inaugural women's event was the first to be contested during the Sydney Games, and crowned Swiss triathlete Brigitte McMahon as the first Olympic champion, over the heavy-favorite Australians. The following day, Simon Whitfield of Canada, who was not considered one of the favorites, came from behind and took the men's gold medal with a 200-meter sprint finish. In similar fashion, long-distance specialist Kate Allen of Austria secured the women's Olympic title in 2004. New Zealand placed two male triathletes in the top two, as Hamish Carter and Bevan Docherty won the gold and silver medals, respectively. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Whitfield was on the verge of repeating his 2000 success, but failed to keep his lead over Jan Frodeno of Germany in the final meters, who pipped the Canadian to the gold medal. The Australian power in women's triathlon was rewarded at the Beijing Games, when three-time world champion and favorite Emma Snowsill clinched the gold medal and Emma Moffatt secured the bronze.\nAfter securing a second career Olympic medal in Beijing, Simon Whitfield (one gold and one silver) and Bevan Docherty (one silver and one bronze) were the only triathletes to have won more than one Olympic medal. In 2016 Alistair Brownlee (twice gold) and Jonathan Brownlee (one silver and one bronce) as well as the first woman, Nicola Spirig Hug (one gold and one silver), joined this circle. In 2021 at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics. Jonathan Brownlee became the first and, to date only, triathlete to win three medals, and the first to have a full set of gold, silver and bronze."

        "text": "Peter Green or Greene (March 13, 1868 – September 22, 1934) was a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and trainer with the Ottawa Hockey Club/Ottawa Senators. Green won ten Stanley Cup titles in his time with Ottawa, four as a trainer, and six as a coach. Green also was a trainer with the Ottawa Football Club and in lacrosse.\nCareer.\nPeter Green began his athletic career with the Ottawa Capitals field lacrosse team as a player in 1890. He would later become their trainer and coach. He coached the Ottawa Rough Riders football team from 1900 to 1903, during which they won two Canadian championships.\nIn 1905, Green was hired by the Ottawa Hockey Club or \"Silver Seven\" as a trainer. In 1908, he was promoted to head coach to replace Alf Smith, who left to join the Kenora Thistles. Under his tenure, Ottawa won the Stanley Cup three times. The 1908–09 team went 10–2 to win the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) title and the Cup for the first time in three years as champion of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association. The team won two challenges during the 1909–10 season, to earn the Stanley Cup title again, only to lose the Cup to the Montreal Wanderers who won the regular season title. The team won the 1910–11 regular season title to regain the Stanley Cup. They then successfully defended it in two Stanley Cup challenges. The team went 9–9 in the following 1911–12 season and lost the chance to tie for the league title with the Quebec Bulldogs after losing a replayed game to end the year. They went 9-11 in the 1912–13 season, tied for third with two other teams. Green left Ottawa after the season, having gone 50-28 in five seasons.\nIn 1919, he was re-hired to coach the Ottawa Senators, now of the National Hockey League (NHL). Green won three more Stanley Cups as a coach in 1920, 1921, and 1922. He is one of eleven coaches to have won the Stanley Cup three times with an NHL club, and he did so on the strength of six playoff appearances, the least among the eleven to have won three. Owing to his short tenure, he has the least games managed among the eleven, but his winning percentage is second best among the eleven, although Green is the only one to not be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. \nGreen was a long-time employee of the Canadian Post Office before retiring in 1933. He died at an Ottawa hospital aged 66 after a short illness (heart condition) on September 22, 1934, five years after his wife died. His funeral at the Blessed Sacrament Church of Ottawa was attended by many of the Ottawa hockey club players he had coached. He was buried in the Prescott Catholic cemetery where his wife was already interred. They had no children."

        "text": "The lunge is the fundamental footwork technique used with all three fencing weapons: foil, épée and sabre. It is common to all contemporary fencing styles.\nThe lunge is executed by kicking forward with the front foot, and pushing the body forward with the back leg. It can be used in combination with different blade work to deliver an offensive action such as an attack.\nThe lunge is one of the most basic and most common types offensive footwork.\nRelation to the attack.\nThe lunge is often used to deliver an attack. In sabre, the end of the attack is defined by the front foot of the lunge landing on the piste. An attack can be made with a lunge on its own, or can be made with a step-forward-lunge, which are both considered single tempo actions.\nHistory.\nThe characteristic motion of the modern lunge traces its ancestry to European swordplay of the 16th and 17th centuries. Scholars of fence such as Egerton Castle attribute the first true lunging attack to Angelo Viggiani and his \"Lo Schermo\" of 1575 (the \"punta supramano\", or \"overhand thrust\"). A simple advance or pass during the thrusting attack is common as early as the Royal Armouries Ms. I.33, roughly dated to the mid-14th century."

        "text": "Richard Max Leach (born May 4, 1957) is an American former college football player and professional baseball player.\nLeach was an all-state quarterback at Flint Southwestern High School in the fall of 1974 and the University of Michigan's starting quarterback for four consecutive seasons (1975–1978), leading the Wolverines to three consecutive Big Ten Conference championships and three appearances in the Rose Bowl. As a senior in 1978, he won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the most valuable player in the Big Ten, was selected as a first-team All-American, and finished third in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy.\nSelected by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (13th overall) of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft, Leach opted to play professional baseball. Primarily a backup outfielder and first baseman for the Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, he played from 1981 to 1990; he had a .268 batting average and .335 on-base percentage in 1,719 major league at bats.\nEarly years.\nBorn in 1957 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Leach attended Flint Southwestern High School in Flint and graduated in 1975. As a senior, he was selected as the first-team all-state quarterback by the \"Detroit Free Press\". He broke every passing record in the Saginaw Valley League and was also an all-conference player in baseball and basketball. In 1998, the \"Detroit Free Press\" rated Leach as the fourth best quarterback to come out of a Michigan high school.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nLeach enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1975. A left-hander, he was the Wolverines' starting quarterback from 1975 through 1978 under head coach Bo Schembechler. As an 18-year-old true freshman, Leach started 11 of 12 games and led the Wolverines to an 8–2–2 record and #8 ranking in the final AP poll. He rushed for 552 yards and passed for 680 yards as a freshman. With the Big Ten championship and a Rose Bowl berth on the line in the Michigan-Ohio State game, Leach threw an interception that was run back to the Michigan 3-yard line by Buckeye cornerback Ray Griffin and set up the winning touchdown in a 21–14 Ohio State victory. However, Leach and the Wolverines never lost to Ohio State again in his career.\nAs a sophomore in 1976, he started all 12 games at quarterback and led the team to a 10–2 record and #3 ranking in the final AP poll. He passed for 973 yards and 13 touchdowns and rushed for 638 yards and 10 touchdowns in 1976.\nAs a junior, he started all twelve games at quarterback and led the 1977 team to a 10–2 record and #9 ranking in the final AP poll. He passed for 1,348 yards and 15 touchdowns and rushed for 375 yards and seven touchdowns.\nAs a senior in 1978, he again started all twelve games and led Michigan to a 10–2 record and #5 ranking in the final AP poll. He passed for 1,283 yards and 17 touchdowns and rushed for 611 yards and 12 touchdowns. Leach won numerous individual honors in 1978, including the following:\nLeach was the first NCAA Division I (now FBS) player to pass for 200 points and score 200 points. He continues to hold the NCAA record for highest percentage of passes for touchdowns (400-499 attempts) with 45 in 462. One of the finest athletes in Michigan history, Leach was named All-Big Ten as a quarterback three times and also placed in the voting for the Heisman Trophy three times.\nLeach shattered all Michigan's career passing, total offense and touchdown records. He set an NCAA record for most touchdowns accounted for (82) and broke Big Ten records for total offense (6,460 yards), total plays (1,034), and touchdown passes (48).\nA standout on the diamond as well as the gridiron, Leach won the Big Ten batting championship as a junior and won the rare honor of being named All-American in both football and baseball.\nIn 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" published a list of \"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures from Michigan\" (in all sports), and ranked Leach 22nd. \"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures from Michigan,\" \"Sports Illustrated\", December 27, 1999.\nProfessional baseball.\nLeach was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (13th overall) of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft. A month earlier at the NFL draft in early May, he was taken in the fifth round (132nd overall) by the Denver Broncos, but opted for a career in baseball. He signed with the Tigers in June 1979 and received a $150,000 signing bonus. Leach spent the 1979 season with the Tigers' Class A farm club in Lakeland, Florida; he appeared in 48 games and compiled a .304 batting average and .402 on-base percentage and had 23 RBIs in 168 at bats. In 1980, Leach was promoted to the Tigers' Class AAA team in Evansville, Indiana, where he had a .272 batting average and .386 on-base percentage with 58 RBIs in 430 at bats.\nAfter batting .386 for Evansville during April 1981, Leach was promoted to the Tigers' roster, making his major league debut in late April 1981. He appeared in 54 games and compiled a disappointing .193 batting average in 83 at bats. Leach remained with the Tigers for two more seasons, principally in a backup role with batting averages of .239 in 1982 and .248 in 1983; the Tigers released him on March 24, 1984, and was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays less than two weeks later.\nLeach spent April 1984 and most of the 1985 season with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. He was promoted to Toronto and remained on their roster through 1988; his best season was 1986, with a .309 batting average in 110 games.\nLeach concluded his major league career with the Texas Rangers in 1989 and the San Francisco Giants in 1990. During a road trip with Texas in May 1989 to New York, Leach disappeared. The Rangers filed a missing persons report, and Leach reappeared a day later. After a positive drug test in late July 1990 at age 33, Leach was placed on the 60-day disqualified list in August and agreed to enter drug rehabilitation. In March 1991, the Giants asked waivers on Leach for the purpose of giving him an unconditional release.\nLater years.\nIn 2008, Leach was elected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame."

He was a first-team All-American in 1934 and has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, and the Rice Athletics Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nWallace was born in 1912 in El Campo, Texas. He attended Eagle Lake High School in Eagle Lake, Texas. He competed in both track and football at Eagle Lake and was later inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame.\nRice Institute.\nWallace then enrolled at Rice Institute (now Rice University) where he competed in football as a halfback and in track as a sprinter and hurdler. He won the Southwest Conference championship in the 222-yard low hurdles and lost the event at the nationals to Jesse Owens and Glenn Hardin. \nIn football, Wallace played on both offense and defense. As a sophomore, Wallace starred at halfback for the 1932 Rice Owls football team. In February 1933, he was suspended along with seven other Rice football players on charges of violating school rules in connection with midyear examinations. \nWallace missed the 1933 season due to the suspension but returned in 1934 and led the 1934 Rice Owls football team to a 9–1–1 record and the school's first Southwest Conference football championship. He was selected as a first-team halfback by the Associated Press and Grantland Rice for \"Collier's Weekly\" on the 1934 All-America college football team. He was the first back from a Texas school to receive first-team honors on a \"Collier's\" All-American.\nAs a senior, Wallace helped Rice to an 8–3 record, but his performance was not at the same level he reached in 1934. He thumbed his nose at opposing players from George Washington, leading one Texas columnist to question whether success had made Wallace \"chesty\". At the end of the season, he received first-team honors from the AP on the 1935 All-Southwest Conference football team.\nLater years.\nWallace was selected in the fourth round (28th overall pick) of the 1936 NFL Draft, but he did not play in the NFL. \nWallace left Rice in April 1936 to accept a job with an oil company in Shreveport, Louisiana. He returned to Rice as an assistant football from 1937 to 1944. He later went into business and lived in Gainesville, Georgia. \nWallace was inducted in 1978 into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame and in 1978 into both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. He died in 1993 at age 80."

        "text": "Grant Dwight Jackson (September 28, 1942 – February 2, 2021) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played eighteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, Montreal Expos, and Kansas City Royals from 1965 to 1982. Jackson was a switch hitter who threw left-handed and served primarily as a relief pitcher.\nFollowing his playing career, Jackson served as a coach for the Pirates and Cincinnati Reds.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in Fostoria, Ohio, on September 28, 1942. He was the fourth of nine children of Joseph and Luella Jackson. His father died in 1960, and Jackson's older brother, Carlos, became a father figure to him. Jackson attended Fostoria High School, graduating in 1961. However, he did not attain the grades necessary to secure a scholarship to Bowling Green State University. There, he played briefly for the Bowling Green Falcons baseball team. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Philadelphia Phillies in November 1961.\nProfessional career.\nJackson made his MLB debut with the Phillies in 1965. Jackson was named to the 1969 National League All-Star team, but did not appear in the game.\nMade available by the Phillies because of several disagreements with manager Frank Lucchesi, Jackson was acquired along with Jim Hutto and Sam Parrilla by the Orioles for Roger Freed on December 15, 1970. In 1973, Jackson went 8–0, with a 1.90 earned run average (ERA) in 80.1 innings of work in 45 appearances with 47 strikeouts for the Orioles. From September 29 to October 1, 1974, Jackson won 3 consecutive games in relief.\nJackson was traded along with Ken Holtzman, Doyle Alexander, Elrod Hendricks and Jimmy Freeman from the Orioles to the New York Yankees for Rick Dempsey, Scott McGregor, Tippy Martinez, Rudy May and Dave Pagan at the trade deadline on June 15, 1976. After the season, Jackson was drafted by the Seattle Mariners from the Yankees as the 11th pick in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. A few weeks later, he was traded by the Mariners to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Craig Reynolds and Jimmy Sexton.\nOn September 1, 1981, Jackson was purchased by the Montreal Expos from the Pirates for $50,000. After the season, the Expos traded him to the Kansas City Royals for Ken Phelps. During the 1982 season, the Royals released Jackson, and he re-signed with Pittsburgh. He was released by the Pirates on October 4, 1982.\nIn his career, Jackson pitched in the World Series three times; in 1971 for the Orioles, 1976 for the Yankees, and 1979 for the Pirates, and was the winning pitcher for the Pirates in Game 7 of the 1979 World Series.\nJackson played for the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing his playing career, Jackson was the Pirates’ pitching/bullpen coach in 1983 through 1985 and a member of the Cincinnati Reds bullpen coaching staff in 1994 and 1995.\nLater life.\nJackson retired from coaching in 2002. He was inducted into the Fostoria High School Hall of Fame two years later, as part of its inaugural class.\nJackson died from complications of COVID-19 at Canonsburg Hospital in Pennsylvania, on February 2, 2021, at age 78."

        "title": "History of water polo",
        "text": "The history of water polo as a team sport began in mid 19th-century England and Scotland, where water sports were a feature of county fairs and festivals.\nDevelopment of the game.\nThe rules of water polo were originally developed in the mid-nineteenth century in Great Britain by William Wilson, a British journalist, swimming instructor, and coach. Wilson was also the author of \"The Swimming Instructor\", one of the earliest books on swimming. Wilson invented the game while working at the Arlington Baths Club. \nThe game originated as a form of rugby football played in rivers and lakes in England and Scotland with a ball constructed of Indian rubber, probably from the 1850s onwards. This ‘water rugby’ came to be called ‘water polo’ based on the English pronunciation of the Balti (Tibetan language of Kashmir) word pulu, which means ‘ball’. Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball; the goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck.\nIn the first edition (1893) of their book ‘Swimming’, Archibald Sinclair and William Henry state \"On May 12, 1870, a committee was appointed by the Swimming Association, then known as the London Swimming Association, to draw up a code of rules for the management of the game of ‘football in the water.’ \" This indicates that forms of the sport we now call ‘water polo’ existed before the current name was in common use. Other names included ‘water base ball’ and (more frequently) ‘aquatic football’. For example, in the South Eastern Gazette (in Kent; now closed), on Tues 28 July 1857, it says \"An aquatic foot-ball match is fixed for to-morrow, Wednesday\".\nOne of the earliest recorded games of a sport called ‘water polo’ occurred at the Crystal Palace (London), on 15 September 1873. It was reported in the Morning Post (now closed) and The Standard (later London Evening Standard). The weather was \"cold and raw\" according to the Penny Illustrated News. It was held in the boating lake that still exists. It was part of the 4th Open Air Fete of the London Swimming Club (founded in 1859).\nThe modern game also developed in Scotland in the late 19th century, when the first games of water polo were played at the Arlington Baths Club in Glasgow (the Club was founded in 1870, and still exists today). In 1886, the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association (Western) held their first championship, the West Cup. West of Scotland beat South Side 1-0. This is probably the first club tournament in the world, and is still played for today. \nThe Swimming Association of Great Britain (SAGB; forerunner of the Amateur Swimming Association, of England) recognised the sport on 13 April 1885.\nCanada was one of the first countries outside the United Kingdom to adopt the sport. The Midland (of England) Counties Swimming and Aquatic Football Association probably set up the first water polo league in the world. Their first champions, in 1884, were Birmingham Leander who beat Hanley 1-0. \nThe first national club championships (in England) were played in 1888. Burton Amateur Club defeated Otter Swimming Club 3–0 in the Old Lambert Baths in London. Burton Amateur was formed in 1878, and still exists today. Otter was formed in London in 1869; and also still exists today, with male and female water polo teams. Though originally it was a male-only swimming club. The London Water Polo League, encouraged by the Otter Club, was formed in 1889. In that year, Nautilus were the first champions, defeating Otter 2-0. The next league was the Northern Counties. Their first champions were Manchester Osborne, who beat Manchester Leaf Street 4-1, in 1892. The longest running single match is the annual one between Oxford and Cambridge universities. This first one was played on 16 October 1891, at the Old Crown Baths, Kensington Oval, London. Oxford won 4–1.\nThe first international water polo match was between England and Scotland at the Kensington Baths in London, on 28 July 1890. Scotland won 4–0. The England team were F Browne, WG Carrey, HF Clark, JF Genders, William Henry, J Finegan and JL Mayger. The referee was Archibald Sinclair (who also founded the London Water Polo league) from Ranelagh Harriers, England. William Henry (1859-1928) and Archibald Sinclair (1866-1922) went on to publish a book called ‘Swimming’ (Longmans &amp; Co, London) in 1893. It included a chapter on water polo and may be the first book to have a chapter on the subject.\nOutside England and Scotland.\nBy the 1880s, the game stressed swimming, passing, and scoring by shooting into a goal net; players could only be tackled when holding the ball and could not be taken under water. Canada was one of the first countries outside Britain to adopt the sport. The Montreal Swimming Club which had formed in 1876 formed a water polo team in 1887 and games were played in the St. Lawrence River along the shore of St. Helen's Island.\nIn 1888, the sport was brought to the USA, by John Robinson, an English swimming instructor; by organising a team at the Boston Athletic Association. Two years later, J.H. Smith and Arnold Heilban started a team at the Sydenham Swimmers Club (later at the Metropole AC) in Providence, Rhode Island. In the autumn of the same year (1890) the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) introduced the game to members. The first US championships were held on 28 January 1890, in Providence, when Sydenham Swimmers Club defeated Boston Athletic Association by 2:1.\nBetween 1890 and 1900, the game developed in Europe, spreading to Hungary in 1889, Belgium in 1890, Austria and Germany in 1894 and France in 1895, using British rules. A different game was being played in the United States, characterized by rough play, holding, diving underwater, and soft, semi-inflated ball that could be gripped tightly and carried underwater. In 1900, the sport of water polo was added to the program of the Olympics – the first team sport to be added. Due to the different codes, European teams did not compete. By 1914, most US teams agreed to conform to international rules. An international water polo committee was formed in 1929, consisting of representatives from Great America and the International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA). Rules were developed for international matches and put into effect in 1930; FINA has been the international governing body for the sport since that time.\nOver the years, both technical and rule changes affected the character of the game. In 1928, Hungarian water polo coach Béla Komjádi invented the \"air pass\", or \"dry pass\", a technique in which a player directly passes the ball through the air to another player, who receives it without the ball hitting the water. Previously, players would let the ball drop in the water first and then reach out for it, but the dry pass made the offensive game more dynamic, and contributed to Hungarian dominance of water polo for 60 years. In 1936, James R. (\"Jimmy\") Smith, California water polo coach and author of several books on water polo mechanics, developed a water polo ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. The previous leather ball absorbed water and became heavier during the game. In 1949, rule changes allowed play to continue uninterrupted after a referee whistled an ordinary foul, speeding up play. In the 1970s, the exclusion foul replaced a point system for major fouls; players guilty of this foul were excluded for a 1-minute penalty and their team forced to play with fewer players. Possession of the ball was limited to 45 seconds before a scoring attempt. Time of penalties and possession has been reduced since then. The direct shot on goal from the seven (7) meter line after a free throw was allowed in 1994, and changed to a five-meter shot in 2005.\nLocal rule variations.\nIn 2006, revisions were made to the NFHS 2006–2007 swimming/diving and water polo rulebook (USWP and NCAA rules still vary). The four and seven-meter lines were merged to a five-meter line. Under the revised rules, a goalkeeper may use two hands and stand on the bottom of the pool (if shallow) until the 5-meter line, and go beyond the 5-meter line according to the field rules (one hand on the ball no standing), but still not pass the half line. The goalie may strike the ball with a clenched fist, although this is not recommended.\nNew cap rules were also enacted. A goalie cap must now be in quarters alternating red/dark for home and red/white for away. The goalie must be number 1 or 13. For women, a red swim cap must be worn under the goalie cap. A team's dark swim cap is no longer acceptable as it is hard to distinguish a goalie from field players if official cap is off.\nOlympic competition.\nMen's water polo at the Olympics was among the first team sports introduced at the 1900 games in Paris (along with cricket, rugby, football (soccer), polo (with horses), rowing and tug of war). Women's water polo became an Olympic sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games after political protests from the Australian women's team. Such protests were rewarded when Australia won the gold medal match against the United States with a \"buzzer-beater\" last-minute goal, taken from outside the seven-meter line.\nSome of the best ever include Spain's Manuel Estiarte who played in a record six Olympics and led in scoring for four of them. Dezső Gyarmati of Hungary won water polo medals at five successive Olympic Games (gold 1952, 1956, 1964; silver 1948; bronze 1960), a record in water polo. Another major figure in the sport was Tamás Faragó, who led Hungary to Olympic Medals in 1972, 1976 and 1980. The play of American Terry Schroeder led the United States to its first Olympic silver medals in 1984 and 1988.\nThe most famous water polo match in history is probably the 1956 Summer Olympics semi-final match between Hungary and the Soviet Union. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian revolution began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. Many of the Hungarian athletes vowed never to return home, and felt their only means of fighting back was by victory in the pool. The confrontation was the most bloody and violent water polo game in history, in which the pool reputedly turned red from blood. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4–0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching Ervin Zádor's eye open. The Hungarians went on to win the Olympic gold medal by defeating Yugoslavia 2–1 in the final. Half of the Hungarian Olympic delegation defected after the games. A documentary by Lucy Liu, \"Freedom's Fury\", premiered in April 2006, recounting the events of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and climaxing with this politicized game.\nInternational play.\nEvery 2 to 4 years since 1973, a men's Water Polo World Championship is played together with the World Swimming Championship, under the auspices of FINA. Women's water polo was added in 1986. A second tournament series, the FINA Water Polo World Cup, has been held every other year since 1979. In 2002, FINA organized the sport's first international league, the FINA Water Polo World League, in which the best national teams compete against one another in an annual season format with nearly half a million dollar purse.\nInternationally, the biggest water polo competition in the world is played in the Netherlands. Prince William of Wales was the captain of his collegiate water polo team at St Andrew's University, Scotland. The annual Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is the sport's longest running rivalry, first played in 1891.\nResults of the major international competitions.\nOlympic Games.\nHungary has been the most successful country in men's tournament, while the United States is the only team to win multiple times at the women's tournament since its introduction.\nWorld Aquatics Championships.\nItaly and the United States are the most successful countries in men's and women's tournaments, respectively.\nFINA Water Polo World Cup.\nHungary and the Netherlands are the most successful countries in men's and women's tournaments, respectively.\nFINA Water Polo World League.\nSerbia and the United States are the most successful countries in men's and women's tournaments, respectively.\nUS colleges and clubs.\nToday club water polo is gaining popularity in the United States. Though the majority of domestic club teams are based in California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas, New England and Missouri preparatory high schools also often field teams. Club water polo teams in the United States often compete in national championships such as Junior Olympics, National Club Championships, and the Speedo Cup. Club teams from Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Michigan were entered at the 2005 USWP Junior Olympics.\nAniko Pelle (Hungary) and Sofia Konoukh (Russia) were among the first of an increasing number of international players competing in U.S. collegiate women's water polo. Because of water polo's increased popularity globally, the influence of international coaches like USC's Jovan Vavic from the former Yugoslavia, and the perks of attending an American college, international players are attracted to the premier US colleges. The 2005 Hawaii women's water polo team, coached by Canadian Michel Roy, has nine international players, the most of any team in the nation.\nTeams from California dominate at the collegiate level. In the United States, water polo players tend to have prestigious academic backgrounds as well. A number of players, including former USA team captain Wolf Wigo, who retired after Athens 2004, Jacqueline Frank DeLuca, bronze medal Olympic goalie, and international phenom Tony Azevedo attended Stanford University. The sport's most notable balancing act to date includes Omar Amr, who played on the US National Team while attending Harvard Medical School and recovering from a near career ending knee injury in 2001.\nIn the 2008 NCAA Women's Water Polo Championship, the UCLA women beat University of Southern California 6 to 3, for their fourth consecutive championship title. In the 2007 Men's NCAA Finals, the UC Berkeley Golden Bears defended their 2006 title by defeating the No. 1-ranked USC water polo men, 8–6. The most prestigious individual water polo honor, the Peter J. Cutino Award, was established in 1999 by the San Francisco Olympic Club, and is presented annually to the top American male and female collegiate water polo player. In 2008, Tim Hutten from UC Irvine and Courtney Mathewson from UCLA won the Cutinos."

        "text": "Showbiz Darts is a British televised celebrity darts tournament which first aired in 2006 on the digital television channel Challenge. It was presented by Sarah Cawood, with famous darts stage host Martin Fitzmaurice, referee George Noble and commentator Tony Green. Producer of the series was Helen Kristic.\nIt was recorded in two sessions on 20 July 2006 at the Lakeside Country Club, home of the World Professional Darts Championship.\nThe celebrities who competed in the tournament were Michael Le Vell, Vicki Butler-Henderson, Roland Rivron, Holly Willoughby, Phil Tufnell, Keith Chegwin, James Hewitt and Johnny Vegas.\nNicknames.\nIn keeping with darting tradition, the celebrities were given or adopted nicknames.\nFormat.\nThe eight celebrities were split into two groups of four, each captained by top darts professionals Andy Fordham and Bobby George who trained their respective teams in preparation for the event. The darts professional trained their team members at very different venues: Andy trained his team at \"The Rose\", a Dartford pub that he runs with his wife, while Bobby trained his at his mansion, George Hall, near Colchester.\nThe four players from Fordham's group competed against each other in a round-robin format and the four players from George's group did the same. The matches consisted of one-leg where the first to reach exactly 501 wins two points. In the event that no player checked out in the time allocated for the match, then the winner was the player who achieved the highest score with 3 darts in a sudden-death shootout.\nThese points were recorded in each team's league table and the top two contenders in each group will then progress to the semi-finals and then the final, where the champion was awarded the Showbiz Darts 2006 trophy.\nResults and Broadcast Dates.\n\"Andy Fordham's Group\"&lt;br&gt;\n2 October: Rowland Rivron beat Johnny Vegas in sudden-death shootout&lt;br&gt;\n4 October: Keith Chegwin beat Vicki Butler-Henderson (winning dart double 7)&lt;br&gt;\n6 October: Vicki Butler-Henderson beat Rowland Rivron (winning dart double 6)&lt;br&gt;\n10 October: Johnny Vegas beat Keith Chegwin (checkout 32 – single 16, double 8)&lt;br&gt;\n12 October: Keith Chegwin beat Rowland Rivron (winning dart double 2)&lt;br&gt;\n16 October: Johnny Vegas beat Vicki Butler-Henderson (checkout 47 – single 15, double 16) &lt;br&gt;\n\"Vegas plays Chegwin in semi-final\"\n\"Bobby George's Group\"&lt;br&gt;\n3 October: James Hewitt beat Phil Tufnell (winning dart double 1)&lt;br&gt;\n5 October: Michael Le Vell beat Holly Willoughby (winning dart double 17)&lt;br&gt;\n9 October: Michael Le Vell beat Phil Tufnell (winning dart double 1) &lt;br&gt;\n11 October: James Hewitt beat Holly Willoughby (winning dart double 1)&lt;br&gt;\n13 October: Phil Tufnell beat Holly Willoughby (winning dart double 4)&lt;br&gt;\n17 October: Michael Le Vell beat James Hewitt (checkout 23 – single 15, double 4)&lt;br&gt;\n\"Hewitt plays Le Vell in semi-final\"\nSemi Finals&lt;br&gt;\n18 October Johnny Vegas beat Keith Chegwin (winning dart double 4)&lt;br&gt;\n19 October Michael Le Vell beat James Hewitt (winning dart double 1)\nFinal&lt;br&gt;\n20 October Michael Le Vell \"(Bobby George's Group)\" beat Johnny Vegas \"(Andy Fordham's Group)\" by 2 legs to 1.&lt;br&gt;\nVegas won the first leg in 47 darts (on double 8), Le Vell the second in 53 (on double 7) and the last in 28 (on double 16).&lt;br&gt;\nThree Dart Averages Le Vell 35.60 Vegas 35.21\nShowbiz Darts: Extra Arrows.\nAfter each episode of the main programme, the celebrities featured on \"Showbiz Darts: Extra Arrows\", a half-hour spin-off show hosted by former MTV presenter DP Fitzgerald where they discussed their game and coaching, as well as celebrity gossip. There was also a daily darts challenge between the two team captains, Bobby George and Andy Fordham.\nViewing figures.\nThe BARB audience viewing figures website reports the top 10 programmes for each multi-channel television station. It lists Showbiz Darts' sister show, Extra Arrows, as reaching the top 10 programmes on several occasions – however the main programme was broadcast at 10:30 pm, so this could possibly be mis-reporting."

        "text": "Glen Warwick Jackson (born 23 October 1975 in Feilding, New Zealand) is a coach for the Fijian Drua and also Fiji national team. Jackson is also a former New Zealand rugby union player and referee. During his playing career, he was a first five-eighth. Domestically, he represented Bay of Plenty and Waikato in the NPC and the Saracens in the UK's Guinness Premiership. His strong performances saw him named in the Chiefs squad for the 1999 Super Rugby season and had international experience as well with New Zealand Māori (now known as the Māori All Blacks) and the Barbarians.\nPlaying career.\nJackson was part of the 2004 Bay of Plenty Steamers team when they won the Ranfurly Shield.\nHe made his debut for the Chiefs in the opening round of the 1999 Super 12 season. Jackson made his final appearance for the Chiefs in a 2004 Super 12 semi-final defeat to the Brumbies. Jackson was a member of the New Zealand Māori side that won the 2004 Churchill Cup. He signed for Saracens in 2004.\nIn 2007 he was voted The Professional Rugby Players' Association player of the year after being leading points scorer in the 2006–07 Guinness Premiership.\nIn 2009 he played for the Barbarians. Jackson played his final game for Saracens against Leicester Tigers in the final of the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership.\nRefereeing career.\nIn 2010 Jackson retired to become a professional referee in his native New Zealand. He was fast-tracked into the professional rugby ranks by Lyndon Bray, then the head of referees for the New Zealand Rugby Union (now known as New Zealand Rugby) and later in the same role with SANZAAR, organiser of Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations). Within a year of Jackson's return to New Zealand, he went from refereeing provincial rugby games in the Heartland Championship to officiating in the ITM Cup at the top provincial level to being an assistant referee in Super Rugby competition. By the end of the 2011 Super Rugby season, he had worked his first match as referee in that competition, having presided over the Hurricanes−Western Force match on 27 May. Shortly after the end of that season, he made his international officiating debut as television match official for the Bledisloe Cup Test between New Zealand and Australia on 6 August. On 15 February 2015 he made his Six Nations refereeing debut when he took charge of the Scotland-Wales match at Murrayfield. Jackson was the first New Zealander to play and referee 100 first class fixtures when he took charge of the Argentina v South Africa match on 15 August 2015. He retired as a referee after he was not selected for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nCoaching career.\nIn September 2020, Jackson was appointed as one of the assistants to Fiji head coach Vern Cotter."

        "title": "Santa Cruz Surfing Museum",
        "text": "The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum is a museum which was established in May 1986 to document the history of surfing. With collections dating back to the earliest years of surfing on mainland United States, the museum houses a historical account of surfing in Santa Cruz, California.\nLocation.\nLocated in the Mark Abbott Memorial Lighthouse at Lighthouse Point on West Cliff Drive, the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum opened its doors in June 1986 as the first surfing museum in the world.\nThe lighthouse was built in 1967 as a memorial to surfer Mark Abbott, who died while surfing at the nearby Pleasure Point surf break. \nOverlooking the Steamer Lane surfing hotspot, this little museum features photographs, surfboards, and videos tracing over 100 years of surfing history in Santa Cruz.\nAfter funding cuts in 2009, the Santa Cruz Surfing Club Preservation Society and private donations kept the museum open.\nExhibits.\nThe exhibits at the museum explore over 100 years of surfing in Santa Cruz. Introduced in 1885 by three Hawaiian princes who surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on plank boards, surfing has permeated every facet of the Santa Cruz community.\nA plaque was dedicated to the princes: David Kawānanakoa, Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui, and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole (later a delegate to US Congress) in April 2010.\nThroughout its history, surf culture has reflected and responded to popular culture. Photographs chronicle the evolution of surfing culture in Santa Cruz from idyllic summers spent at the beach in the 1930s and 1940s, through the hipster beach party 1950s, the surf rock 1960s, the “soul surfing” 1970s, the neon 1980s, and the rebirth of classic long-board riding in the 1990s.\nExamples of surfboards from each era are on display, from the huge hollow paddle boards and redwood planks made and ridden in the 1930s and 1940s to examples of early foam and fiberglass boards, and speedy short boards used to create radical new surf moves beginning in the 1970s.\nSanta Cruz Light.\nThe museum contains the current Santa Cruz Light, marking Point Santa Cruz on the west side of Santa Cruz Anchorage.\nThe original lighthouse was one of a number of California coastal lights allocated funding by Congress in 1850, only 19 days after statehood. Because of disputes over ownership of the land, construction did not proceed until 1868. The original light was a two-story wooden structure, with a lantern housing a fifth-order Fresnel lens. Erosion of Point Santa Cruz required the lighthouse to be moved back in 1879.\nAround 1909 (sources vary, possibly 1913) the lens was replaced with a fourth-order Fresnel, for better visibility against the light of the city. The light was electrified in 1917, replaced by a wooden tower in 1941, and the original building demolished in 1948."

        "title": "Jack Gibson (ice hockey, born 1880)",
        "text": "John Liddell MacDonald \"Jack\" Gibson (September 10, 1880 – November 4, 1954) was a Canadian-born ice hockey player and executive. Known as the \"father of professional hockey\", Gibson founded the International Professional Hockey League in 1904, the first fully professional hockey league in history. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1976.\nBiography.\nJack Gibson was born in Berlin, Ontario, which later became Kitchener. As a youth, he excelled in academics and athletics, playing a number of sports well, including lacrosse, cricket, rowing, running, cycling, tennis, and skating. Gibson received an offer to play in the developmental system of Everton Football Club. He considered the move, but decided to stay in North America to continue his studies. He graduated from Berlin High School in 1896.\nGibson was a gifted hockey player who played throughout Ontario and helped the Berlin Hockey Club win the provincial intermediate championship team in 1897. Gibson and his teammates were expelled from the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) in 1898 after being accused of accepting payment. The OHA was militantly opposed to professionalism and banned the team after Berlin's mayor presented each player with a $10 gold coin in celebration of a win over the rival team from Waterloo. Gibson had offered to return the coin, to no avail.\nHe attended Pickering College to pursue a Bachelor of Science. He was also a member of the Pickering football team. Later, he moved to the University of Detroit Dental School.\nAfter graduation, he moved to the northern Michigan community of Houghton to set up a dental practice. Still a gifted hockey player, he recruited other talented individuals and established the Portage Lakes Hockey Club in 1900–01. Portage Lakes was an openly professional team, and Gibson captained the squad and was its leading scorer.\nAfter defeating the Montreal Wanderers in 2 exhibition contests in the 1903–04 season in front of 5,000 fans at the Houghton Amphidrome, it became obvious to Gibson that Northern Michigan was a hockey hotbed and could sustain a league and the International Professional Hockey League, the first professional hockey league in the world, opened for business in 1904.\nGibson retired from playing after 1904, but remained active in recruiting players to the league, while also serving as a referee. Gibson attracted the likes of Hod and Bruce Stuart, Riley Hern, and Cyclone Taylor to play in the league. In addition to Houghton Portage Lakes, the Calumet Miners, Michigan Soo Indians, the Pittsburgh Pro Hockey Club and the Canadian Soo team rounded out the league. The league folded after only three years when professional hockey became a reality in Canada in 1907 and many of the star players returned home. 15 of the 97 players who played in the IPHL from 1904 to 1907, including Gibson, are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nAfter practising dentistry and refereeing local games in Houghton for a few years, Gibson also returned to Canada and set up a dental practice in Calgary, Alberta, where he resided until he died in 1954. In 1976 Gibson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.\nBeginning in 1939, a trophy, named the Gibson Cup, was awarded to the champion of the Michigan-Ontario Pro Hockey League. Today, the Gibson Cup is given to the winner of an annual challenge series between the Portage Lake Pioneers and the Calumet Wolverines. The Gibson Cup is the third-oldest hockey cup in North America, behind only the Stanley Cup (1893) and the MacNaughton Cup (1913). The MacNaughton Cup goes to the regular-season champion of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. He joined the United States Hockey Hall of Fame during 1973."

        "text": "Phillip Brooks Douglas (June 17, 1890 – August 1, 1952) was an American baseball player. He was known as \"Shufflin' Phil\", most likely because of his slow gait from the bullpen to the mound.\nDouglas originally signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1912, but soon landed with the Cincinnati Reds. In 1915, he was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers, then to the Chicago Cubs. Douglas' short stints with these and future teams stemmed from their frustrations with his well-documented alcoholism, about which a contemporary journalist wrote, \"Drinking was not a habit with Douglas—it was a disease.\"\nHis throwing error on a sacrifice bunt in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series gave the Boston Red Sox a 3–2 victory over the Cubs.\nIn 1919, he was signed by the New York Giants. John McGraw had some luck in keeping Douglas' drinking under control. In 1920, Douglas had a 14–10 record and a 2.71 ERA. Following the season, the spitball was banned but 17 players, including Douglas, were allowed to continue using the pitch.\nDouglas' best year was in 1921, when he won 15 games in the regular season with an ERA of 2.08. He then won two games in the 1921 World Series to help the Giants win the series.\nIn 1922, he had 11 wins and a league-leading 2.63 ERA, but was suspended after a quarrel with McGraw and fined $100.\nShortly after he was suspended and while intoxicated, Douglas sent the following letter to Les Mann of the St. Louis Cardinals:\nI want to leave here but I want some inducement. I don't want this guy to win the pennant and I feel if I stay here I will win it for him. If you want to send a man over here with the goods, I will leave for home on next train. I will go down to fishing camp and stay there. \nThe letter found its way to Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Landis banned Douglas from baseball for life.\nOn August 1, 1952, Douglas died in Sequatchie, Tennessee, and was buried in Tracy City, Tennessee."

        "title": "William Shakespeare (American football)",
        "text": "William Valentine Shakespeare (September 27, 1912 – January 17, 1974) was an American football player. He played at the halfback position, and also handled punting, for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams from 1933 to 1935. He gained his greatest acclaim for throwing the winning touchdown pass as time ran off the clock in Notre Dame's 1935 victory over Ohio State, a game that was voted the best game in the first 100 years of college football. Shakespeare was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1935 and was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Sharing the same name as \"The Bard of Avon\", Shakespeare earned nicknames including \"The Bard of Staten Island\", \"The Bard of South Bend\", and \"The Merchant of Menace\".\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nShakespeare was born on Staten Island, New York. His father, Valentine Shakespeare, was a New York City firefighter and the captain of Fire Company 163. The family claimed to be direct descendants of the famed writer William Shakespeare. The younger Shakespeare became a star football player at Staten Island's Port Richmond High School. He showed particular talent as a punter and later told reporters that he had trained his pet fox terrier to retrieve his punts as he practiced his technique.\nNotre Dame.\nBard of Staten Island.\nHe enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in 1932, the year after the death of the school's legendary football coach Knute Rockne. He played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams in 1933, 1934, and 1935, and was selected as a consensus All-American in 1935.\nBecause of his shared name with William Shakespeare, \"The Bard of Avon\", he acquired nicknames \"The Bard of Staten Island\" and \"The Merchant of Menace\". Newspapers reported that, though he claimed to be a direct descendant of the Bard, Shakespeare had flunked his sophomore English class. In 1934, newspapers published a photograph of Shakespeare staring at a football in the manner of Hamlet examining Yorick's skull under the caption \"To Be Or Not To Be -- Football Player or English Wizard Is Perplexing Question Facing William Shakespeare, of Notre Dame.\"\n1933 and 1934 seasons.\nAs a sophomore in 1933, Shakespeare was a substitute at the halfback position. He also showed promise as a punter with an average of 53.2 yards on five punts.\nAs a junior in 1934, Shakespeare became the starting left halfback in the Notre Dame's first year under new coach Elmer Layden. In an October 1934 win over Carnegie Tech, Shakespeare ran 56 yards for a touchdown on a sweep play around the right end. The Associated Press noted: \"Superb blocking opened the route for Shakespeare, who put a little reverse English on his dash and then outfooted the field to score.\" On November 24, 1934, he helped lead the Irish to a 12–6 win over Army with a 67-yard touchdown pass to Dominic Vairo in front of a crowd of 81,000 at Yankee Stadium. The Associated Press wrote that \"the Irish scored a touchdown on a sensational pass, Shakespeare to Captain Vairo, who took the ball on Army's 15 as he was surrounded by three cadets and broke away to spring across the goal line.\" And in the final week of the season, he threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to Francis \"Mike\" Layden in a 14–0 win over the University of Southern California. He led the 1934 Notre Dame team in several offensive categories, including passing (230 yards and two touchdowns), kickoff returns (60 yards on four returns), and punting (41 punts for 1,638 yards and a 40.0 yard average).\n1935 season.\nEarly games.\nIn the opening game of the 1935 season, Shakespeare threw a pass from the 50-yard to Wayne Millner, who caught the ball on the five-yard line and ran into the endzone for a touchdown as Notre Dame defeated Kansas 28–7. The following week, Shakespeare ran for a touchdown against Carnegie Tech at Pitt Stadium—the first touchdown scored by Notre Dame in Pittsburgh since 1931. Against Wisconsin on October 12, 1935, he caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Vic Wojcihovski to help lead Notre Dame to a 13-0 win at Camp Randall Stadium. In the fourth week of the 1935 season, Notre Dame beat Pitt, 9–6, as Shakespeare scored Notre Dame's only touchdown. Shakespeare also booted an 86-yard punt (70 yards in the air) in the Pitt game, still the longest punt in Notre Dame football history. He also kicked a 75-yard punt against Navy in 1935 that ranks as the fifth-longest in school history.\n\"Game of the Century\".\nOn November 2, 1935, Notre Dame faced the undefeated 1935 Ohio State Buckeyes team in front of a crowd of 81,000 at Ohio Stadium. Ohio State was favored in the game and led at half-time by a score of 13–0. The score remained the same at the start of the fourth quarter, but the Irish rallied in the fourth quarter for two touchdowns to narrow Ohio State's lead to 13–12. With less than a minute left in the game, Notre Dame's quarterback Andy Pilney ran for a 30-yard gain to the Ohio State 19-yard line. Pilney was injured on the play and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher. Shakespeare replaced Pilney and threw a pass into the arms of an Ohio State player who intercepted the ball but dropped it before securing possession. With the clock running out, the ball was snapped to fullback Jim McKenna, who handed it to Shakespeare on what appeared to be a reverse. Shakespeare threw a pass into the endzone, which was caught by Wayne Millner on his knees for an 18–13 win.\nThe 1935 Notre Dame-Ohio State match was regarded as one of the greatest comebacks in history of the sport. Red Barber, who broadcast the game on radio, later called it \"the greatest college football game I ever called.\" In \"The New York Times\", Allison Danzig opened his report on the game by writing, \"One of the greatest last-ditch rallies in football history toppled the dreaded Scarlet Scourge of Ohio State from its lofty pinnacle today as 81,000 dumbfounded spectators saw Notre Dame score three touchdowns in less than fifteen minutes to gain an almost miraculous 18–13 victory in jammed Buckeye Stadium.\" Radio announcer Tom Manning added, \"I always said Shakespeare had a pair of rosary beads and a bottle of holy water in his back pocket.\" The media picked up stories of the Catholic faithful praying for Notre Dame as they listened to the game on the radio. One nun told a reporter of overhearing a colleague in her convent \"gamefully bargaining\" and eventually \"threatening\" the Poor Souls and saints for another Notre Dame touchdown. The \"Chicago Tribune\" later noted the irony that it was a truly ecumenical group that combined for the famed \"Hail Mary\" pass: \"Mazziotti, a Catholic, handed to Shakespeare, a Protestant on a fake reverse. Shakespeare passed to End Wayne Millner, a Jewish boy.\" In 1969, as part of the centennial of the first college football game, the Associated Press conducted a poll to select the \"game of the century\", and the 1935 Notre Dame-Ohio State game was chosen as the best game in the first 100 years of college football.\nLater games.\nThe week after the Ohio State game, Notre Dame faced Northwestern featuring All-American end Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Before the game, the Associated Press carried a story profiling the two players: \"Shakespeare and Longfellow will meet tomorrow —- not to trade verses, but to play all the football they know.\" Longfellow later recalled, \"Shakespeare and I played against each other for three years. Each year, because of our names, we got a terrific buildup. It was a natural, I suppose. All through my college days I never heard the end of it. The writers went wilder each year.\" Longfellow got the better of Shakespeare in 1935, as he caught a touchdown pass to help Northwestern win the game, 14-7. Shakespeare attempted to lead the Irish to another come-from-behind victory, as he ran 48 yard to the Northwestern ten-yard line late in the game, but the Northwestern defense held. On the last play of the game, Shakespeare threw a \"long, desperate pass\", but it was intercepted as time ran out.\nOn November 16, 1935, Shakespeare led a Notre Dame comeback against Army, but the comeback fell short as the game ended in a 6–6 tie. The game was played in Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 80,000, and Army led 6–0 late in the game. With a minute to go, Shakespeare threw a 44-yard pass to Millner at the Army goal line. The ball fell from Millner's arms, but the referee called pass interference and Notre Dame scored on the next play from the two-yard line. Damon Runyon wrote of the finish: \"It is the opening gun, so to speak, of the duel with William Valentine Shakespeare, who waits until the very last minute to put on a typical Shakespeare finish to a Notre Dame football tale.\"\nShakespeare concluded his football career with a come-from-behind victory over the USC Trojans On November 23, 1935. USC led 6–0 at halftime, but Notre Dame scored 20 points in the second half. The Associated Press credited Shakespeare for leading the comeback: \"Heading the brilliant attack was the 'bard of Staten Island,' William Shakespeare who closed his collegiate career with one of his greatest games.\" Shakespeare started the rally by throwing a 38-yard touchdown pass to Wally Fromhart.\nPost-season honors.\nShakespeare finished the 1935 college football season as Notre Dame's leader in most offensive categories, including passing (19 completions on 66 attempts for 267 yards), rushing (374 yards and four touchdowns on 104 carries), punting (1,801 yards on 45 punts), kickoff returns (123 yards on five returns), and scoring (24 points). He was selected as a consensus first-team All-American and finished third in the voting, behind Jay Berwanger and Monk Meyer, for the first Heisman Trophy award.\nNFL Draft.\nShakespeare was drafted in the first round (3rd overall selection) of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates (now Steelers). The 1936 draft was the first official NFL draft, and Shakespeare holds the distinction of being the third player ever selected in an NFL draft, the first Notre Dame player to be drafted in the first round, and the first first-round pick for the Pirates. Despite being drafted in the first round, professional football was not a high-paying proposition in the mid-1930s, and Shakespeare opted for a career in business rather than professional football.\nBefore turning to a career in business, Shakespeare did take time to appear with fellow All-Americans Jay Berwanger, Bobby Wilson, Monk Moscrip and Gomer Jones in the RKO Pictures feature film, \"The Big Game\".\nWorld War II.\nIn July 1943, Shakespeare entered the U.S. Army and went overseas with the Ground Forces Reinforcement Command of the 106th Division. He was commissioned as a captain and commanded a machine-gun platoon of the 424th Infantry Regiment, which played a prominent role in the Ardennes breakthrough, and served in Northern France and the Rhineland Campaign. Shakespeare was awarded four battle stars, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Bronze Star for gallantry during the Battle of the Bulge.\nLater years.\nShakespeare joined the Cincinnati Rubber Company upon graduating from Notre Dame in 1936. With exception of the time he spent in military service during World War II, Shakespeare spent his entire career with the company. By 1959, he had become a vice president of the company, and he became the company's president in 1960. He lived in Kenwood, Ohio and remained president of Cincinnati Rubber until his death in 1974. He died in January 1974 at age 61 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati. He was married with two sons.\nAwards.\nIn 1983, Shakespeare was posthumously named to the College Football Hall of Fame and he has also been inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame."

Training in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Nomads boast three senior men's teams, two senior women's and seven junior squads, running from minis to U18. The senior women's team currently plays in the Ontario Women's League, while the senior men's team currently play in the Marshall Championship, the senior division of Ontario Rugby Union.\nNomads history.\nClub founding.\nIn August 1950, Reverend Freddie Miller, along with an ad hoc Rugby Strategy Committee, began recruiting rugby players at the Canadian National Exhibition. Shortly after this recruitment push, 80 rugby players and rugby enthusiasts met at the Pine Room of the 48th Highlanders Memorial Hall. The group divided into three teams: The Nomads (led by Reverend Freddie Miller), the Wanderers and the Barbarians. Almost seven decades later, the three teams continue to play against each other (along with numerous other Ontario rugby clubs, which have sprung up since the 1950s).\nNags.\nThe Nomads Acting Group (NAGs) was created by a handful of Nomads players who were homesick for the theatre they had grown up performing and enjoying before moving to Canada. The first performances put on by The Nomads were \"Cupid is a Bum, Is a Bum, Is a Bum\" and \"Meet the Folks\" on April Fools' Day, 1976 at the Tranzac Club in the Annex. The plays were such a huge success that the NAGs still put on shows today, including a winter British-style pantomime, as well as annual spring and a fall shows.\nNomads elite players.\nActive players.\nThe Nomads have produced a number of elite players including Kelly Russell, Laura Russell and Lucas Hammond. All three play for Canada's professional senior teams with Laura Russell captaining the Senior Women's 15s team to silver during the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup. Her sister, Kelly Russell, plays number four for Canada's Senior Women's 7s team when they took gold at the 2015 Pan Am competition. Kelly Russell will be representing Canada at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics where she will be playing for Canada's 7s team.\nRetired players.\nIn 1995 Ian Gough played lock for the Nomads before going on to play professionally for Wales.\nSeason and training.\nThe Nomads are one-sixth owners of Fletcher's Fields, the premier rugby facility in Ontario, Canada, located north of the city of Toronto. Their home games are played at Fletcher's while training takes place in downtown Toronto.\nUnlike almost all other (northern hemisphere) rugby countries, the Ontario rugby season runs from May until November. The sub-zero temperatures during the winter make playing and training outdoors impossible. The Nomads run an indoor touch session on Saturdays throughout the winter months. Their junior training programs also run throughout the winter.\nRecruitment.\nThe Toronto Nomads are an all-welcoming club. All players who turn up to training and pay their annual fees get game time on Saturdays. Fees do not have to be paid until matches commence in April, however some pre-season training will carry a small weekly fee for indoor location hire. In addition to The Nomads' locally developed players, each season sees an increase in foreign-based players, predominantly from Ireland, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Other nationalities currently represented at the club include Argentina, France, the US, and Zimbabwe. Although in more traditional rugby countries it is not uncommon for players to be paid, this is not the case in Canada."

        "title": "Artistic cycling",
        "text": "Artistic cycling is a form of competitive indoor cycling in which athletes perform tricks (called exercises) for points on specialized, fixed-gear bikes in a format similar to ballet or gymnastics. The exercises are performed in front of judges in five-minute rounds by singles, pairs, four- or six-person teams.\nHistory.\nThe first unofficial world championships in artistic cycling was held in 1888 by Swiss-American Nicholas Edward Kaufmann and was largely a publicity stunt to showcase his trick bicycling.\nThe first official world championships were held for men in 1956 and for women in 1970.\nBikes.\nThe bicycles used for artistic cycling are a form of fixed gear bicycle. The gearing of the chainring and sprocket are run at or near a one-to-one ratio, but the chainring may not have fewer teeth than the sprocket. The wheels must be of equal size and are closely spaced in order to make tricks, such as wheelies, easier to perform.\nThe handlebars are similar in form to a shallow drop handlebar found on a racing bicycle which has been turned upside down. Handlegrips or bar tape are applied to the top, horizontal portions of the bar. The handlebar, which can spin 360°, is mounted to a stem that has no horizontal extension, which puts the stem clamp in line with the steering axis and allows for the handlebars to remain in the same relative position no matter whether the front wheel is facing forward or backward.\nThe crank arm length may have a center to center distance of 130 to 170 mm.\nRiding area.\nThe riding area for artistic cycling is a wooden court, which also serves cycle ball competitions, that ranges in dimensions from 9 × 12 meters to 11 × 14 meters, where the maximum size is mandated for international competitions.\nThree concentric circles are taped or painted at the center of the court with diameters (measured to the outside edge of the line) of 0.5, 4, &amp; 8 meters. Four half-meter hashes extend radially from the four quadrants of the middle circle.\nA clear area of 0.5 to 2 meters must be free of all immovable objects around the perimeter of the court. Two meters is required for international competitions."

This number includes programs transitioning from a lower NCAA division, most from Division II and one from Division III. For the 2024–25 season, four schools will become full Division I members, having completed transitions from Division II, while two schools will start transitions from Division II.\nEach program employs a head coach. As of the 2024–25 season, the longest-tenured head coach is expected to be Greg Kampe, who has been head coach at Oakland since 1984. However, Kampe does not have the longest tenure at the Division I level because Oakland played in NCAA Division II before the 1997–98 season. The longest tenure at the D-I level is expected to be that of Tom Izzo of Michigan State, who has coached the Spartans since 1995–96.\nConference affiliations reflect those of the upcoming 2024–25 college basketball season."

        "text": "Gator Golf is a children's miniature golfing game. It was released in 1994 by the American game company Milton Bradley. In the game, children take turns putting into the mouth of a motorized plastic alligator figure, which then flings the ball off its tail and spins around, creating a new challenge for the next player. \"Gator Golf\"'s commercial tag line was \"\"Gator Golf\" - what could be greater than playing a game of golf with a gator?\" It was released again in 2008, then in 2009 under the \"Elefun and Friends\" banner. It was then re-released in 2019 by Goliath Games. The game was then re-released again in 2020 by Toy City in the UK and its name was \"Gator Golfers\".\nHistory.\n\"Gator Golf\" was invented by toymaker Robert B. Fuhrer who had also developed the 1990 game \"Crocodile Dentist\". Fuhrer submitted his idea for \"Gator Golf\" (then known as \"Crocodile Dentist Golf\") to Milton Bradley in November 1992. Phil Grant and Mike Meyers of Milton Bradley played a key role in developing the game. Milton Bradley asked him to consider using a different animal in the game, such as a beaver or a dragon, but Fuhrer's original idea remained mostly intact. The game debuted at the 1994 American International Toy Fair, and became one of the most popular children's toys of the 1994 Christmas season.\nThe game was released again in 2008, without the spins (possibly to keep the game at a lower price than the original) and changing the color from green to orange. However, in 2012, the color was turned back to green (though the design of the gator from the 2008 version remained).\nThe game was released once again in 2019 by Goliath Games. The gator was given a complete redesign, with birds on its back to keep the score. "

        "text": "John A. Stevens (born May 4, 1966) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He is an assistant coach of the Vegas Golden Knights. He is the former head coach of the Los Angeles Kings and the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Stevens was a defenceman for the Flyers and Hartford Whalers during his playing career. Stevens was born in Campbellton, New Brunswick, but grew up in Turkey Point in Norfolk County, Ontario.\nPlaying career.\nStevens was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the third round, 47th overall, of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Stevens followed up a junior career with the Oshawa Generals in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) by playing four seasons for the Hershey Bears of the AHL. He was called up to the NHL level at times during the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons, playing in a total of 9 games with the Flyers. He was signed by the Hartford Whalers in 1990 and reassigned to the Whalers' AHL team, the Springfield Indians. Stevens was named team captain that year and went on to win the Calder Cup with the team that same year for the franchise's seventh Championship title. With the Indians' franchise moving to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1994, Stevens became the first captain of the successor franchise, the Springfield Falcons, where he played for two additional years.\nIn 1996, Stevens signed once more with the Flyers, and was named the first captain of its expansion farm team, the Philadelphia Phantoms. The Phantoms won their first Calder Cup in his second season as captain.\nStevens played in 53 NHL games for the Flyers and the Whalers scoring no goals, ten assists and recording 48 penalty minutes. In the AHL, he played in 834 games, scoring 20 goals and 166 assists for 186 points. Ironically, given his low scoring output as a defensive defenceman, Stevens scored the first goals in franchise history for \"both\" the Falcons and the Phantoms.\nCoaching career.\nStevens was forced to retire as a player in 1999 due to a career-ending eye injury, but remained with the Phantoms as an assistant coach. He then became the club's second head coach in 2000 when Bill Barber was promoted to the Flyers. During his six-season tenure as coach, the Phantoms made the playoffs four times and won their second Calder Cup title in 2005. Stevens was himself promoted to the Phantoms' parent club as an assistant coach after the 2005–06 season, and on October 22, 2006, was named as head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers after Ken Hitchcock was fired. On October 26, Stevens coached his first NHL game, a 3–2 win over the Florida Panthers. On November 20, the Flyers announced that they had signed Stevens to a 2-year contract.\nHis first season with the Flyers saw his team set a franchise record for consecutive losses (10 games) and finish the 2006–07 season with the club's worst record in its 40-year history. The Flyers set an NHL record for the biggest drop off in points from one season to the next – 101 points in the 2005–06 season to 56 points in the 2006–07 season for lowest point total in the league.\nHowever, as stunning as their fall from grace was the previous season, Stevens guided the Flyers to an immediate renaissance in 2007–08. The Flyers won 42 games and amassed 95 points in the regular season under Stevens's guidance. In the playoffs, the Flyers beat the Washington Capitals in the first round and upset the top-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the second round before falling to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals. For this, \"The Hockey News\" honored Stevens with their Coach of the Year award.\nStevens was fired by the Flyers on December 4, 2009, after a 13–11–1 start and with a team expected to be a Stanley Cup favorite sitting in 10th place in the Eastern Conference.\nOn June 24, 2010, he was signed to a three-year contract to be an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Kings, joining former Flyers coach Terry Murray as well as former Flyers player Ron Hextall in the Kings organization.\nDuring the 2011–12 season, after Kings coach Terry Murray was fired, Stevens acted as interim head coach for 4 games before Darryl Sutter took over. He then returned to his post as Assistant Coach, a position he held when the Kings won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history at the season's end. The Kings again won the Stanley Cup in 2014 with Stevens as an assistant behind the bench.\nOn June 18, 2014, he re-signed with Kings and was promoted to associate head coach.\nOn April 23, 2017, Stevens was named the head coach of the Los Angeles Kings. In his first season as the head coach of the Kings, he guided the Kings back to the playoffs as the first wild card in the Western Conference, but they were swept by the Vegas Golden Knights in the first round. On November 4, 2018, the Kings fired Stevens after a 4–8–1 start to the 2018–19 season.\nHe later became Assistant Coach for the Dallas Stars, a position he left on May 20, 2022. He later joined the coaching staff of the Vegas Golden Knights, as an assistant coach, which was announced on June 28, 2022. He then won a third Stanley Cup on June 13, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nStevens grew up in the lakeside village of Turkey Point, Ontario. His three brothers also played hockey, and his brother Larry Stevens played briefly with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League.\nStevens has two sons who also play hockey. His eldest son, also named John, played high school hockey for Salisbury School in Connecticut and one season with the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League (USHL) before playing college hockey for the Northeastern University Huskies hockey team. John Jr. signed with the New York Islanders of the NHL after finishing his college career and is currently playing on their AHL affiliate team, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. John's younger son, Nolan Stevens, played for the US National Development Team in the USHL, before joining his brother at Northeastern. Nolan was drafted in the 5th round, 125th overall of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft by the St. Louis Blues. Stevens resides in Sea Isle City, New Jersey in the summer."

        "title": "History of English cricket (1826–1845)",
        "text": "In English cricket, the years 1826–1845 were dominated by the roundarm bowling issue, which was resolved when the style was legalised in 1835, and by the formation of the first modern county clubs between 1839 and 1845.\nBackground.\nCricket had been badly impacted by the Napoleonic Wars with a significant loss of both investment and manpower. While a recovery began in 1815, and a more widespread return to normality can be observed, it was not until 1825 that inter-county matches resumed. County cricket had been very popular in the 18th century and it was revived by Sussex and Kent in the 1820s and 1830s. The first county clubs were founded in this period. Since its foundation in 1787, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) had become cricket's most influential organisation, especially in its role as the guardian of the \"Laws of Cricket\" and Lord's, its home ground, was the sport's premier venue.\nRoundarm bowling.\nThe controversy surrounding roundarm bowling came to a head before the 1827 season began and three trial matches were played between Sussex and an England XI. No firm conclusions were drawn in the immediate aftermath of the trials and it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised.\nIn 1828, MCC modified Rule 10 of the \"Laws of Cricket\" in an attempt at compromise. The amendment permitted the bowler's hand to be raised as high as the elbow. In practice, however, Sussex bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge continued to bowl at shoulder height and the umpires did not no-ball them. Roundarm's supporters claimed that their campaign was a \"March of Intellect\".\nIn 1835, powerless to prevent the use of roundarm, MCC finally amended the \"Laws of Cricket\" to make it legal. The relevant part of the Law stated: \"if the hand be above the shoulder in the delivery, the umpire must call No Ball\". Bowlers' hands now started to go above the shoulder and the 1835 Law had to be reinforced in 1845 by removing benefit of the doubt from the bowler in the matter of his hand's height when delivering the ball.\nCounty cricket.\nFrom 1826, inter-county cricket flourished again, following its post-war revival in 1825. Leadership came from the Sussex county organisation based on the Midhurst club. Sussex played matches against Kent and a combined Hampshire/Surrey team.\nThe earliest mentions of the sport were recorded in the counties of Staffordshire (1817), Herefordshire (1823), Worcestershire (1829), Westmorland (1827) and Cumberland (1828) during this period, cricket in all other counties having been recorded in earlier times.\nThe first real move towards the establishment of a county club took place in 1836. Although Sussex had been a major centre of cricket since the 17th century, there had apparently been no move towards a permanent county organisation until 17 June 1836 when a meeting in Brighton set up a Sussex Cricket Fund to support county matches. It was from this organisation that Sussex County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1839.\nThe 1837 season saw the beginning of Kent's dominance of English county cricket which lasted through the 1840s. Mainstays of the Kent team in those years included Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch, Nicholas Felix, Ned Wenman and William Hillyer. The team claimed a total of eight \"Champion County\" titles between 1837 and 1849.\nOn 28 August 1844, a match on Hartlebury Common between teams from Worcestershire and Shropshire is the earliest known reference to a county team in Worcestershire.\nIn the early 1840s, Dr Henry Grace and his brother-in-law Alfred Pocock had founded the Mangotsfield Cricket Club which merged in 1846 with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club, whose name was adopted until 1867, after which it became the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. In 1863, the Cheltenham and Gloucestershire Cricket Club was founded and is believed to have been a forerunner of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, which had definitely been founded by 1871. Exact details of the club's foundation have been lost.\nEngland Elevens.\n5 May 1826 — a significant event that would in time accelerate the spread of cricket throughout England was the passage of an Act of Parliament that authorised creation of the Liverpool to Manchester Railway and effectively began the \"railway boom\". William Clarke was the first to comprehend the potential benefits of rail travel for cricket and, in 1845, began to plan the formation of a travelling All England Eleven which would realise that potential and claim its resultant profits.\nMatches, venues and teams.\nIn 1833, Yorkshire was used as a team name for the first time on record because Sheffield were playing against Norfolk, a county team.\nNottinghamshire as a county team, and perhaps also as a county club, played its first inter-county match v. Sussex at Brown's Ground, Brighton on 27, 28 &amp; 29 August 1835. Previous matches involved Nottingham as a town rather than Nottinghamshire as a county. Nottinghamshire is recognised as a first-class county team from 1835.\nIn 1838, the Trent Bridge ground in Nottingham was opened by William Clarke.\nOn 1 March 1839, Sussex County Cricket Club was constituted out of the Sussex Cricket Fund organisation that had been set up in 1836. Sussex was formally established as the first county cricket club and replaced the \"ad hoc\" county elevens representing the traditional county of Sussex in top-class cricket.\nThe new Sussex club played its first top-class match versus MCC at Lord's on 10 &amp; 11 June 1839.\nNottinghamshire County Cricket Club was founded in March or April 1841. The exact date has been lost and it is possible that an informal county club may have been created in 1835 out of the old Nottingham town club. The official foundation of Nottinghamshire is dated 1841.\nIn 1841, the Duke of Wellington issued an order that a cricket ground must be made as an adjunct to every military barracks.\nOn 6 August 1842, formation of the first Kent County Club at Canterbury; a second club was created at Maidstone in 1859 and the two combined in 1870 to form Kent County Cricket Club. Kent's Canterbury Week and The Old Stagers were instituted in 1842. The Canterbury club played its first top-class match against an England XI at the White Hart Ground, Bromley on 25, 26 &amp; 27 August 1842.\nSurrey County Cricket Club was officially founded by a meeting which took place at the new Kennington Oval during a match between two local teams on 21 &amp; 22 August 1845.\nIn 1845, I Zingari (\"the Gypsies\") formed as a travelling club.\nGentlemen v Players.\nThe fixture was revived in 1827 and the Players were handicapped in various ways for many years to try and equalise the teams.\nNorth v South.\nThe inaugural North v South fixture between the North of England and South of England cricket teams was held at Lord's on 11 &amp; 12 July 1836. The North won by 6 wickets.\nNoted people.\n31 December 1826. Death of John Small, the great Hambledon batsman.\nThe 1832 season was overshadowed by the early death of James Saunders on 27 March. He was only 29 and had been ill with consumption for the last two years. \"Scores and Biographies\" states that he was a \"great batsman\" who \"had scarcely reached his prime\". He was a fine attacking batsman who had the potential to be one of the greats.\nActive players, administrators and other contributors of the period included:\nAchievements.\nTom Marsden had only one innings in 1826, scoring 227 for Sheffield and Leicester v Nottingham at the Darnall New Ground in Sheffield. A report said Marsden batted over eight hours, approximately 4½ hours on 25 July and 3½ hours on the 26th.\nOn 22 August 1827, George Rawlins playing for Sheffield against Nottingham became the first batsman to be out hit the ball twice in a first-class game. This has since occurred only six more times in English first-class cricket, and not since 1906.\nMCC and Lord's.\nThe Lord's Pavilion, gutted by fire in July 1825, was rebuilt in time for MCC's annual dinner on Thursday, 11 May.\nIn 1835, the lease of Lord's was transferred to J. H. Dark, who remained proprietor until 1864.\nIn 1842, Roger Kynaston succeeded Benjamin Aislabie as secretary of MCC (to 1858).\nSingle wicket.\nJohn Major on pp. 405–409 has listed numerous single wicket events during the period.\nLiterature.\nArthur Haygarth closed his \"Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1\" at the end of the 1826 season.\nJohn Nyren published \"The Cricketers Of My Time\" and \"The Young Cricketer's Tutor\" in 1833. These works were written from Nyren's recollections by Charles Cowden Clarke and had been serialised in \"The Town\" during the previous year.\nSchools and universities.\nThe importance of cricket in the public schools and universities cannot be overstated, especially the influence of public school cricket and its Victorian ethics upon the growth of the British Empire and the spread of industrialisation. The period saw an increasing number of good amateur players come through the education system and make their mark in first-class cricket.\nFirst recorded century in a school match: 146 not out by W. Meyrick for Winchester v Harrow in 1826.\nOn 4–5 June 1827, Cambridge University v Oxford University at Lord's was the first-ever University Match. The result was a draw. The captains were Charles Wordsworth (Oxford) and Herbert Jenner (Cambridge). It became an annual fixture in 1838.\nRules and equipment.\nIn 1835, in addition to legalising roundarm, the \"Laws of Cricket\" were amended to enforce a compulsory follow on if the team batting second was 100 runs behind on first innings.\nBatting pads were probably invented in 1836 and gradually came into widespread use.\nChanges in fashion affected the sport and a reaction to the virility cult espoused by Beauclerk and his ilk brought about the introduction of safer equipment such as padded leg-guards and padded gloves. Wicketkeeping gloves were first mentioned about 1820 and were in general use by 1850. Batting pads had been proposed much earlier, particularly by Robert Robinson, but it was not until the horrific leg injury suffered by Alfred Mynn in 1836 from a ball by Sam Redgate that pads were seen as an essential item of equipment.\nCuriously, whereas Sam Redgate was viewed with trepidation in terms of his pace, he was very much a reactionary in fashion terms. Among professionals in the 1830s, he was said to be the last to discard breeches in favour of trousers. Trousers have existed since ancient times but never became fashionable until the \"sans-culottes\" of the French Revolution. In England, they began to replace breeches during the Napoleonic War and were widely in use by 1815. Redgate was not alone in his preference for breeches: the Eton and Harrow teams still wore them in 1830.\nWith trousers came the belts with metal clasps that remained popular until well into the 20th century. Many professionals preferred braces.\nWigs went out with the 18th century and men followed the lead of Napoleon Bonaparte by having their long hair cut short. The Hambledon players had worn hats when playing and this fashion persisted except that the style of hat changed dramatically. By 1830, the tall \"beaver\" hats familiar in pictures of William Lillywhite and Fuller Pilch had become common. These would be either black or white. Many players preferred a straw hat based on the rural style but these were replaced by white bowler hats, first worn by I Zingari in 1845, which were usually adorned with a ribbon in club colours.\nThe tall hats were replaced before 1850 by the flannel cap which tended to be either white or chequered. Then the familiar cricket cap began to appear. The schools adopted these first: Eton (light blue) and Winchester (blue) in 1851; Harrow (striped) in 1852. The blue caps worn by Cambridge and Oxford date from about 1861 and 1863 respectively. The county clubs gradually introduced their own caps thereafter though the amateurs still tended to wear their school caps.\nColoured shirts were worn in the middle years of the century as team uniforms, though all were a pattern on a white background (e.g., the All-England Eleven wore white shirts with pink spots). The frilled shirts of Georgian times were replaced by plain cloth. Some players wore high collars and many used a rather large bow tie.\nFootwear was almost universally confined to the black \"Oxford\" shoe.\nA kind of short white flannel jacket had originally been mentioned as early as 1812 and this was probably an early form of blazer."

        "title": "Billy Wilson (Australian rugby league)",
        "text": "Billy Wilson (30 May 1927 – 25 March 1993) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. An Australia national and New South Wales state representative front-row forward, he captained the national team in two Tests against New Zealand in 1963 and captained-coached several of his club sides during a record length top-grade career over twenty seasons from 1948 to 1967. Much of his New South Wales Rugby League premiership career was spent with Sydney's St. George club where he was a pivotal member for the first half of that club's 11-year consecutive premiership run from 1956. Billy Wilson won six consecutive premierships with the Dragons between 1956 and 1962.\nEarly career.\nWilson was a St. George junior, growing up in Blakehurst in Sydney. He was graded for the St. George Dragons in 1948 as a centre/lock. Regularly during his early career Wilson would take up the financial opportunities offered to captain/coach country first division sides. In 1950 he and his wife Norma moved to Picton for that purpose from where he represented for Southern Division against the touring 1950 Great Britain side. In 1951 he was captain-coach at Baradine's club in northern New South Wales.\nPlaying career.\nSt. George Dragons\nHe returned to St George in 1952 cementing a regular first grade position from 1953 and he soon earned a reputation as a rugged enforcer and fierce protector of his teammates. In the final decider of 1953 against South Sydney he was sent-off by referee Darcy Lawler for fighting with South's Martin Gallagher. In 1954 he featured in the Dragon's semi-final win against North Sydney playing out the match with a broken arm, gashed eye and three broken ribs.\nHe was instrumental in the 1956 Grand Final where the Dragons commenced their long run of victories. St George centre Merv Lees cracked his collar bone early in that match and Wilson moved out from the pack to play in the centres in spite of being constrained himself with a knee injury. Wilson tormented his Balmain Tigers opposition three-quarters in both attack and defence and set up both his own wingers for a number of long dashes. He was later selected by his teammates as man of the match.\nHe captain-coached Wagga in the Riverina competition in 1957 then returned to the St. George Dragons for five more premiership victories from 1958 to 1962.\nWilson made his state debut for New South Wales in 1959 aged 32 against a touring New Zealand side and then debuted for Australia in the first Test against that same side. He went on to play in all three Tests of that series and was then selected on the 1959 Kangaroo tour where he played in 5 Tests and 14 minor tour matches. Wilson is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 345.\nThe 1962 NSWRFL season's Grand Final was Wilson's last for St. George, his sixth Grand Final victory and his role became infamous. Dragons captain Norm Provan was knocked out by Wests Jim Cody five minutes before half time. Cody escaped any official punishment but Provan was carried from the field and didn't return again until well into the second half. Wilson came out as captain after the break and after having told his players to keep things calm he squared things up in the first seconds after kick-off before the first tackle was even made. The order of proceedings was unclear, but Cody went down and referee Jack Bradley sent Wilson off. With no replacements allowed in those days, St George were reduced to 11 men until Provan returned to the field 15 minutes later.\nFrom an interview with Wilson's wife Norma conducted in 1994, Larry Writer reports that Wilson felt enormously guilty about putting the team in this position and promptly retired after the match. Larry Writer himself suggests that the send-off may have soured Wilson's relationship with club officials in spite of the victory. These views aside, at 35 years of age, the clubs saw the end of Wilson's playing career to be looming and his contract was not renewed. As of the 2007 NRL season no forward since Wilson has been sent off in a Grand Final and in that game Wilson became the only man to have been sent off in two Grand Finals following his dismissal in 1953.\nNorth Sydney Bears\nIn the twilight of his career aged 36 in 1963, with his new club, North Sydney Bears showing sparkling early-season form, Wilson was selected as captain for New South Wales in the interstate series against Queensland and then was honoured with the national captaincy for the domestic Test series of 1963 against New Zealand following injury to Arthur Summons. He set the record for being the oldest Australian Test captain (36 years and 23 days). After five seasons with the North Sydney Bears, Bluey Wilson retired in 1967, age 40, having set the record for longest Australian first grade career of any player (20 seasons).\nPersonal life.\nAn electrician by trade, Wilson contracted at the Kurnell Oil Refinery while it was being built from 1952 to 1965 and was promoted to electrical supervisor. He then contracted as an electrician housing construction in the St George district before joining St George Appliances as a sales representative of ovens and ranges. From 1978 he and his family were in hotels, owning pubs at Oberon, Nambucca Heads and then Gympie.\nHe was the publican and licensee at the Freemason's Hotel in Gympie, Queensland at the time of his death in 1993 of a cerebral haemorrhage following a stroke.\nOn his death Billy &amp; Norma had been married 43 years to the day. They had two sons – Brad and Steve (who played third grade for St. George) and a daughter, Yvonne who followed Billy into the hotel business.\nAccolades.\nOn 20 July 2022, Wilson was named in the St. George Dragons District Rugby League Clubs team of the century."

        "title": "Overthrow (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, an overthrow (sometimes called a buzzer) is an additional run scored by a batter as a result of the ball not being collected by a fielder in the centre, having been thrown in from the outfield. Overthrows usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully at the stumps in an attempt to run out a batter, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball.\nRuns scored in this manner are counted in addition to any runs already scored before the fielding error took place, and are credited to the batter. If the ball reaches the boundary as a result of an overthrow then the four runs for the boundary are added to the number of completed runs before the overthrow, which can lead to the unusual event of a batter scoring more than six runs off a single ball. It is considered an overthrow run if a ball hits a wicket while the batter is inside the popping crease and then the batter runs.\nThere have been at least four instances in Test cricket of eight runs being scored off a single ball. The most recent was by Andrew Symonds for Australia against New Zealand at Brisbane in November 2008, when the batters managed to run four runs before the ball was thrown back over the wicket keeper's head for a four-run boundary.\nIt is possible for the ball to be thrown over more than once from the same ball, leading to even more runs being scored. In theory there is therefore no limit to how many runs may be scored off a single ball.\nDeflections.\nA throw that deflects off the batter or bat and goes to the boundary is sometimes also considered an overthrow. A notable incidence of this was in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, where six runs were scored off a deflection from Ben Stokes's bat. A similar incident repeated in the first test of the New Zealand tour of England in 2022, with the throw deflecting off Ben Stokes' bat at the same venue (Lord's) and with the ball being bowled by the same bowler, Trent Boult, only the ball not going to the boundary."

        "title": "Jim Beattie (baseball)",
        "text": "James Louis Beattie (born July 4, 1954) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played for the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners from 1978 to 1986. He also served as the Montreal Expos' general manager from to , and was the Baltimore Orioles' general manager with Mike Flanagan from to . As of , Beattie served as a professional scout in the Toronto Blue Jays organization through the 2018 season. Beattie retired from his decades-long career in MLB at the end of the 2018 season. Beattie starred in baseball and basketball at South Portland High School in South Portland, Maine.\nAmateur career.\nBeattie earned All New England honors playing basketball at Dartmouth College in , and was MVP of the Kodak Classic in . In 1974, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe New York Yankees selected Beattie in the fourth round, with the 91st overall selection, of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft. He was soon tabbed one of the top pitching prospects in the Yankees' farm system, along with Ken Clay and Gil Patterson. Each vocalized frustration with the organization when they acquired pitchers Goose Gossage, Andy Messersmith and Rawly Eastwick after the season believing that it hindered their chances of making the major league roster.\nA rash of injuries opened the door for Beattie, and he made the club out of spring training in . He pitched innings and gave up just one run in his major league debut to beat Hall of Famer Jim Palmer and the Baltimore Orioles. After a second win against the Chicago White Sox on May 15, Beattie lost his next seven decisions in a row. He was, however, on the mound for two of the Yankees' most important games that September. With the Yankees having been as far back as fourteen games to the Boston Red Sox on July 19, they surged to just four games back by the time they headed to Fenway Park for a four-game set from September 7–10. Beattie started the second game of the series, holding Boston to just three hits and no runs over his first eight innings of work. After the Red Sox scored two unearned runs in the ninth, he handed the ball over to Ron Davis for the final out. The Yankees swept the series to move into a tie with Boston. They moved on to Detroit for a three-game set next, and Beattie won the second game of that series to give the Yankees sole possession of first place. He finished his rookie season with a 6–9 record and a 3.73 earned run average (ERA) in 25 games (22 starts).\nFollowing a one-game playoff with the Red Sox, the Yankees headed into the postseason. Beattie won Game 1 of the 1978 American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, and earned a complete game victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the World Series.\nDespite his late season and postseason heroics, Beattie failed to make the club the following spring. He was, however, called up by the beginning of May. On June 20, a line drive off the bat of the Toronto Blue Jays' John Mayberry shelved Beattie for two months. On September 12, , Boston Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski singled off Beattie for his 3,000th career hit. After the season, he, Rick Anderson, Juan Beníquez and Jerry Narron were traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ruppert Jones and Jim Lewis.\nSeattle Mariners.\nDespite posting a 5.01 ERA, Beattie's record stood at 3–3 on May 21, following a victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. He only won two more games for the rest of the season, and finished at 5–15 with a 4.85 ERA in 33 games (29 starts). Beattie started the season in the bullpen, but after getting rocked in three outings, he was reassigned to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League Spokane Indians. He returned to the majors after the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, and pitch an eight inning gem against the California Angels on August 11 for his first victory of the season. Beattie went 3–2 with one save with a 2.02 ERA while holding batters to a .212 batting average in the second half, as opposed to the eight earned runs he gave up in innings of work prior to his demotion to Spokane. His one and only career save came during a wild 20-inning game on September 3, 1981. The Mariners defeated the Red Sox at Fenway Park 8–7 in a 20-inning game. Beattie recorded the final out of the game to nail down the victory. His success carried over into the season. Despite an 8–12 record, his 3.34 ERA was seventh-best in the American League, 140 strikeouts was eighth-best, and the .233 batting average he held batters to was sixth-best.\nOn September 27, , Beattie hurled the first one-hitter in Seattle Mariners history against the Kansas City Royals. Outside of a U.L. Washington single in the third inning, Beattie was perfect. Perhaps the second-best pitching performance of his career came in a losing effort. On July 25, , he and the California Angels' Ron Romanick locked up in a pitchers' duel. Beattie pitched nine innings of one-hit ball while striking out nine. With the game still scoreless heading into extra innings, Beattie took the mound again in the tenth inning, where Gary Pettis ended it with a two-out walk-off single. After the game, Beattie smashed a water cooler and refused to talk to reporters.\nBeattie began dealing with shoulder tendinitis late in his career. He missed six weeks of the season with tendinitis, then tore his rotator cuff upon his return.\nBeattie returned from surgery midway through the season. He pitched effectively in his first start against the Chicago White Sox on June 12, and was in line for the victory until the bullpen imploded. From there, Beattie himself imploded as he went 0–6 with a 6.02 ERA in nine games (seven starts) through August 7, when he was placed back on the disabled list.\nPost-playing career.\nRather than trying to catch on with another big league club after being released by the Mariners, Beattie opted to go back to school. He received his M.B.A. from the University of Washington in (he also has a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth), then returned to the Mariners as their player development director in . Beattie remained in that position through the 1995 season, when he was named general manager and vice president of the Montreal Expos. He quit at the end of the season; after a year away from the game, he joined the Baltimore Orioles as executive vice president of baseball operations. He served as co-GM of the Orioles with former Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan through the season, when Flanagan was given the job solely. When Boston Red Sox GM Theo Epstein threatened to leave the Red Sox shortly afterwards, Beattie interviewed for the job. He also interviewed for the vacant Houston Astros GM job in .\nIn something of an unexpected career turn, Beattie finished the 2007 season as the Florida Marlins' bullpen coach. After former bullpen coach Steve Foster became Florida's pitching coach following Rick Kranitz's departure, Beattie jokingly offered his services to Marlins GM Larry Beinfest, and Beinfest took him up on his offer. Beattie was also rumored to be a candidate for the Marlins' pitching coach position in 2008, but the job instead went to Mark Wiley.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

        "title": "Speed skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics – Men's 500 metres",
        "text": "The 500 metres speed skating event at the 1924 Winter Olympics was held on 26 January 1924 at the Stade Olympique de Chamonix in Chamonix, France. One of five speed skating races to be contested at these Games, this was the first event ever contested at the Winter Olympics. The event was won by American Charles Jewtraw who became the first Winter Olympics gold medallist.\nSummary.\nThe event required competitors to skate one and quarter laps of the 400 metre track. Under the rules of the International Skating Union, athletes raced in pairs in a straight time-trial event. Prior to the event, the pairs were determined by the drawing of lots. With 31 speed skaters from 13 nations due to compete, this was reduced to 27 from 10 nations after the withdrawal of four athletes, including Christfried Burmeister who was due to be Estonia's only representative at the inaugural Winter Games. He did not enter the Chamonix event and his withdrawal was not communicated to the organisers of the Games in time. This resulted in a slight reordering of the skaters.\nLeading up the Games, the Finnish team was training in Davos where Clas Thunberg had set a time of 43.8 seconds, four tenths slower than Oscar Mathisen's world record. Mathisen's professional status prevented him from participating in these Games. The Americans took part in metric competitions at Saranac Lake, where Jewtraw set a time of 46.6 seconds. He also set a new world record in the 100 yard event in 9.4 seconds whilst Roald Larsen of Norway skated 44.6 seconds in Frogner.\nJoe Moore of the United States and Eric Blomgren of Sweden became the first athletes to ever compete at the Winter Olympics, with Moore setting the first Olympic record covering the distance in 45.6 seconds. Asser Wallenius of Finland, bettered Moore's time by six-tenths of a second to move into first position with 11 skaters remaining. Next to skate was the eventual silver medallist Norway's Oskar Olsen who crossed the line in 44.2 seconds. The defending world champion Clas Thunberg and Norway's Roald Larsen had to settle for sharing the bronze medal with a time of 44.8 seconds. The gold medal performance came from pair 15 where American Jewtraw was up against Charles Gorman. The Canadian took the lead, before he was soon overtaken by Jewtraw finishing in a time of 44 seconds.\nJewtraw coming from a poor family found the sport expensive but found sponsorship from Lake Placid businessman Jack Mabbit. He had retired before the 1924 Games but returned to the sport to compete in France. After competing in the 1500 and 5000 metre events at these Games he retired for good. Jewtraw's gold medal is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were set during this competition.\nResults.\nThe event began Saturday at 10:00.\nOfficials.\nThe officials for the events were as follows."

        "text": "Frederick Bushnell Ryder (November 16, 1871 – June 5, 1936), commonly known as Jack Ryder, was an American college football player and coach and sportswriter. He served as the second head football coach and the first paid at Ohio State University, coaching from 1892 to 1895 and again in 1898, compiling a record of 22–22–2. Ryder was later a noted sportswriter for \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\".\nEarly years and playing career.\nRyder was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1871, but moved with his family as a youth to New England. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he learned the game of American football. In 1888 Ryder returned to Oberlin to attend Oberlin College. He introduced the game to that school, and soon began to pressure the school administration to allow the Oberlin students to form an intercollegiate team. The pressure ultimately paid off in the Fall of 1890.\nBefore the Oberlin team would play a game, however, Ryder decided to transfer to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He later played for the Williams team. He graduated in 1892.\nCoaching career.\nIn the Fall of 1892, Ryder came to Columbus, Ohio to teach at Columbus Academy. He was also offered a job as the head coach of the Ohio State University football team. He was the first coach hired at the University. The Ohio State Buckeyes football team had previously been coached by Alexander Lilley, but Lilley had worked as a volunteer. In his first season, Ryder was paid $15 per week for a season total of $150.\nRyder led Ohio State to its first winning season. He introduced the concepts of closed practice and a training table. He also introduced a formation known as the Ryder Wedge, which was a variation of a wedge formation he had used at Williams College. In Ryder's first season, Ohio State outscored their opponents 242 to 14 in their five wins, and were outscored 130 to 18 in their three losses. Ryder stayed with Ohio State from 1892 until 1895.\nDuring this time Ryder became proprietor of Columbus Academy. Later, during the Spanish–American War, Ryder saw service with the Ohio Cavalry. Following the war, he returned to Columbus and served one more year, 1898, as the Ohio State coach.\nSportswriting career.\nRyder then landed a job at the Columbus newspaper, the \"Ohio State Journal\", and became a successful sportswriter. In 1905, he was offered a job with \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\". Ryder replaced Charles Webb Murphy as \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\"'s sportswriter, and was a fixture at that newspaper for more than 30 years. While with the Enquirer, Ryder usually covered the Cincinnati Reds baseball team.\nIn 1919, Ryder helped give the nickname to the University of Cincinnati sports teams, the Bearcats. Cincinnati's football team had five years earlier fielded a star fullback named Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr. In a 1914 game against Kentucky, the Cincinnati fans cheered, \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\" In 1919, Ryder revived the nickname and attributed it to the entire team. The name stuck and was soon adopted by the University.\nAs \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" sportswriter, Ryder was a voter for the Most Valuable Player award for baseball's National League. He was one of eight American sportswriters, one from each National League city, who voted for the award. In 1924, St. Louis Cardinals second baseman Rogers Hornsby batted .424. Ryder did not give Hornsby a single vote in any of the ten spots on his ballot because he considered Hornsby a selfish player. Ryder was quoted as saying: \"I will concede Hornsby is a most valuable player to himself, but not to his team. On that basis I couldn't give him a solitary vote.\" Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Dazzy Vance won the award.\nRyder retired from \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" in June 1936. Soon after, he died of a heart attack in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Avondale."

        "text": "Interactive skeleton-driven simulation (or Interactive skeleton-driven dynamic deformations) is a scientific computer simulation technique used to approximate realistic physical deformations of dynamic bodies in real-time. It involves using elastic dynamics and mathematical optimizations to decide the body-shapes during motion and interaction with forces. It has various applications within realistic simulations for medicine, 3D computer animation and virtual reality.\nBackground.\nMethods for simulating deformation, such as changes of shapes, of dynamic bodies involve intensive calculations, and several models have been developed. Some of these are known as \"free-form deformation\", \"skeleton-driven deformation\", \"dynamic deformation\" and \"anatomical modelling\". Skeletal animation is well known in computer animation and 3D character simulation. Because of the calculation insensitivity of the simulation, few interactive systems are available which realistically can simulate dynamic bodies in real-time. Being able to \"interact\" with such a realistic 3D model would mean that calculations would have to be performed within the constraints of a frame rate which would be acceptable via a user interface.\nRecent research has been able to build on previously developed models and methods to provide sufficiently efficient and realistic simulations. The promise for this technique can be as widespread as mimicking human facial expressions for perception of simulating a human actor in real-time or other cell organisms. Using skeletal constraints and parameterized force to calculate deformations also has the benefit of matching how a single cell has a shaping skeleton, as well as how a larger living organism might have an internal bone skeleton - such as the vertebrae. The generalized external body force simulations makes elasticity calculations more efficient, and means real-time interactions are possible.\nBasic theory.\nThere are several components to such a simulation system:\ndomain with calculations of these hierarchical functions similar to that of lazy wavelets\nRather than fitting the object to the skeleton, as is common, the skeleton is used to set constraints for deformation. Also the hierarchical basis means that detail levels can be introduced or removed when needed - for example, observing from a distance or hidden surfaces.\nPre-calculated poses are used to be able to interpolate between shapes and achieve realistic deformations throughout motions. This means traditional keyframes are avoided.\nThere are performance tuning similarities between this technique and procedural generation, wavelet and data compression methods.\nAlgorithmic considerations.\nTo achieve interactivity there are several optimizations necessary which are implementation specific.\nStart by defining the object you wish to animate as a set (i.e. define all the points):\nformula_1 .\nThen get a handle on it.\nLet formula_2\nThen you need to define the rest state of the object (the non-wobble point):\nformula_3\nProjects.\nProjects are taking place to further develop this technique and presenting results to SIGGRAPH, with available reference of details. Academic institutions and commercial enterprises like Alias Systems Corporation (the makers of the Maya rendering software), Intel and Electronic Arts are among the known proponents of this work. There are also videos available showcasing the techniques, with editors showing interactivity in real-time with realistic results. The computer game Spore also has showcased similar techniques."

        "text": "Andrew Walker (born 22 November 1973) is an indigenous Australian former professional rugby footballer who represented his country in both rugby league and rugby union - a dual code international. Walker was the first dual code international to represent his country at rugby league before representing rugby union.\nBackground.\nWalker was born in Shoalhaven, New South Wales, Australia.\nCareer.\nHailing from Nowra, Walker began his career as a rugby union footballer for Shoalhaven Rugby club as a junior, before moving to Randwick DRUFC, where he played alongside Eddie Jones in their 1991 premiership-winning season. He changed rugby football codes from rugby union to rugby league he transferred to NSWRL Premiership club St. George Dragons the following season.\nWalker played for several NRL clubs including the St George Dragons, Sydney Roosters and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In 1996, he played in one match for the Kangaroos against a Papua New Guinean side. He is known as the first dual-international to switch codes from league to union; 2 years before the more publicised exodus of Wendell Sailor and Mat Rogers.\nWalker's provincial rugby was with the ACT Brumbies. He is remembered among Brumbies fans for scoring thirteen tries in the 2000 season, which included two hat-tricks. Walker became Australia's 40th dual code international when he made his Australia début against New Zealand during July 2000 following Scott Gourley and preceding Wendell Sailor and Mat Rogers. However his debut was not a memorable one as he came off the bench for the last 10 minutes of the game at Stadium Australia in front of a world-record crowd and proceeded to miss a conversion, kick straight down the throat of Christian Cullen and then, after the resulting New Zealand try to Jonah Lomu to win them the game 39–35, he failed to send the kick-off 10 metres and New Zealand received the ball.\nWalker changed rugby football codes from rugby union to rugby league after his Australia career ended following disciplinary difficulties, but he was subsequently banned for two years in 2004 following cocaine use when playing for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nIn 2006 he resurrected his career by signing to play with French rugby union club UA Gaillac. During December 2006 Walker began renegotiations with Queensland Reds' coach Eddie Jones (who had previously coached him with the Brumbies) to play in the 2007 Super fourteen season . In early March, Walker was named on the bench of the Queensland Reds team and played the last 15 minutes in their Week 5 defeat by the Lions. This came just hours after he was released from UA Gaillac and signed by the Queensland Reds until his retirement on 26 July 2008.\nOn 26 July 2008, Andrew Walker announced his retirement from representative rugby union. At the time he was playing for the Easts Tigers Rugby Union in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition, where he won the Hospital Cup and the Australian Club Championship. 35 Years old at the time, Walker retired, stating fatigue and a need to spend more time with his family who supported him through his successful but troubled career.\nHowever, in early January 2010, Andrew Walker signed a minor contract with the Goodna Eagles rugby league football club, who are based in Ipswich, Queensland, becoming the biggest signing in Ipswich Rugby League history.\nIn 2019, he played one game for Randwick DRUFC against Argentina."

He also worked in television, including for ITN's News At Ten and Panorama.\nWhen Ireland joined the European Economic Community in January 1973, Andy Mulligan first became head of the division responsible for general reports, but his journalism experience led to the role of director of press and information at the EEC delegation in Washington in 1974.\nFor the next seven years he worked with the aim of informing the American public, and especially centres of power and learning, about the EEC. One of his achievements was the setting up of a professionally produced and written magazine, Europe, to replace the free publication which had been mainly distributed on campuses.\nAndy Mulligan also organised valuable transatlantic seminars, bringing together media, diplomats and experts. One of the most notable was at Waterville, County Kerry, in 1979, during the Irish European Commission Presidency, which was attended by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.\nAfter leaving the Commission in 1983, Mulligan and his family remained in the US, where he set up Mulligan Communications and European Media with the ambition of bridging the media gap between the US and Europe.\nPersonal life.\nAndy Mulligan married Pia Ursula Schioler in 1964. They had two sons, Finn and Joachim and two daughters, Maia and Katrina."

        "text": "The 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 76th playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 12, 2005 at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan, the home of the Detroit Tigers of the American League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 7–5, thus awarding an AL team (which eventually came to be the Chicago White Sox) home-field advantage in the 2005 World Series. In this game Rawlings first previewed the Coolflo batting helmets, which became standard the followig season.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAmerican League.\nNotes\nManagers.\nNational League: \"Tony LaRussa\"\nAmerican League: Terry Francona\nGame.\nGame summary.\nA superchoir consisting of three choirs from Windsor, Ontario, sang \"O Canada\", the Canadian National Anthem. Then, a moment of silence for the victims of the July 7 London bombings, which took place a few days before the game, followed by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra Brass Players' performance of \"God Save the Queen\", the national anthem of the United Kingdom. Brian McKnight sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the U.S. National Anthem. The colors presentation was by the Camp Grayling color guard, accompanied by University of Toledo ROTC officers who presented the flags in the outfield.\nIn the first inning, starters Mark Buehrle and Chris Carpenter each induced a double play, from Carlos Beltrán and Manny Ramírez respectively, to end early threats. The American League would score in the bottom of the second, when the game's MVP, Miguel Tejada, crushed a shot off John Smoltz to give the AL a 1–0 lead. The AL would score two more in the third, on the strength of a David Ortiz RBI single, and an RBI groundout by Tejada, his second RBI in as many innings.\nThe NL wasted a scoring opportunity in the top of the fourth, when with two runners on, Aramis Ramírez grounded into a double play to end that threat. In the bottom of that inning, Ichiro Suzuki hit a broken-bat, bloop single to score two, but was then picked off first base by Liván Hernández. Then, in the bottom of the sixth, Mark Teixeira, a switch-hitter, hit an opposite field, two-run homer off Dontrelle Willis, his first home run off a left-hander that season, opening the AL's lead to 7–0.\nDuring the seventh-inning stretch, Brian McKnight sang \"God Bless America\".\nThe NL finally got on the board in the next inning, when Andruw Jones launched a two-run shot just inside the foul pole off Kenny Rogers to close the NL to within five. They scored another run in the eighth, when Moisés Alou scored on an RBI forceout by Miguel Cabrera.\nIn the top of the ninth, Luis Gonzalez scored Andruw Jones with a double off of Baltimore closer B.J. Ryan, and then scored himself on an RBI groundout by Carlos Lee. Mariano Rivera then came on to stop the NL's potential rally. Rivera struck out Morgan Ensberg to end the threat, and the game, securing a 7–5 win for the AL.\nHall-of-Famer and former Tigers outfielder Al Kaline joined the ceremonial first pitch ceremonies.\nPrior to the game, Taco Bell sponsored a Pitch for a Million Dollars contest. The contestant Frank Nelson was chosen randomly from people who had attended and submitted their name at the local All-Star Game events held in Detroit in the weeks prior. The contestant Frank Nelson would have to pitch 5 balls through a hole in 30 seconds from the mound to the home plate. Taco Bell informed him the Tuesday prior to the Game and made him sign an agreement to not practice the day of and could only receive verbal coaching from his coach Mark \"The Bird\" Fidrych. The size of the hole was also reduced due to someone winning it previously. He was only able to pitch one thorough the hole within the 30 seconds, so he received the Runner up prize of $5.00 each week towards Taco Bell for a year.\nHome Run Derby.\nIn this event, the eight competitors each came from a different nation. This format dovetailed with the announcement of the launch of the World Baseball Classic the week before, as of the following year."

        "text": "Michael Calvin Richardson (born May 23, 1961), also known as \"L.A. Mike\", is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) during the 1980s. He played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils. He was a starter for the 1985 Super Bowl XX winning Chicago Bears.\nCollege career.\nHe played college football for Arizona State University, and was recognized as an All-American in 1981 and 1982. Richardson was only the 6th All-American in ASU history at the time, and the second player ever to achieve it twice. In his final two seasons, the Sun Devils went 19-4, and he closed out his college career with a win over University of Oklahoma in the 1982 Fiesta Bowl. In his four years at Arizona State, he intercepted 18 passes, returning them for 131 yards and two touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nHe played professionally for the NFL's Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers, and won Super Bowl XX as a member of the 1985 Bears.\nRichardson finished his 7-season career with 20 interceptions, which he returned for 247 yards and a touchdown. He also recorded 4 fumble recoveries. He was a featured soloist of the \"Shuffling Crew\" in the Super Bowl Shuffle novelty music video in 1985. His line in the song \"I like to steal it and make em pay\" would be reflected in his performance on the field, as he finished the season with 174 return yards from just 4 interceptions.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2008 Richardson faced a 13-year sentence for possession of methamphetamine and crack cocaine. It was his 21st drug conviction since the end of his football career. Former teammate Richard Dent and coach Mike Ditka both supported Richardson being sent to a rehab facility rather than prison. The judge ultimately sentenced Richardson to a year in prison and an extended probation period, violation of which would result in Richardson serving the remainder of a 13-year sentence.\nIn late December 2020, Richardson was arrested for homicide in Phoenix, in relation to a suspected cocaine transaction gone awry."

        "title": "Dave Robinson (American football)",
        "text": "Richard David Robinson (born May 3, 1941) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions and professionally for the Green Bay Packers and the Washington Redskins. Robinson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.\nEarly life.\nRobinson, the youngest child of Leslie Robinson and his wife, Mary Gaines, lived in Mount Laurel, New Jersey for the first 18 years of his life. Robinson is a 1959 graduate of Moorestown High School and a member of three unbeaten NJSIAA championship teams: \nRobinson earned the name \"Lefty\" because he was a left-footed kicker.\nCollege career.\nFrom 1960 to 1962, Robinson played end on offense and defense at Penn State University. The Nittany Lions' record was 24–8 under the guidance of head coach Rip Engle and assistant coach Joe Paterno. Robinson's honors in 1962 included: All-America status, College Player of the Year from the Newark Athletic Club, and College Lineman of the Year from the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.\nIn 1962, during his senior year, Robinson led Penn State to a 9–1 regular- season, made 17 receptions for 178 yards and was named a first-team All-America by the Associated Press, NEA, Football Writers (Look), Post and Time magazines. The first-team All-East choice also was named the nation's top collegiate lineman by the Philadelphia Sportswriters.\nRobinson was the MVP of the 1962 Gator Bowl, despite the Nittany Lions' loss to Florida. He was inducted into the Gator Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996.\nRobinson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\nRobinson is among 22 members of the Penn State football family who are enshrined into the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (1997). He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1982.\nRobinson earned his degree in Civil Engineering at Penn State University. He also minored in economics.\nProfessional career.\nRobinson was selected by the Packers in the first round of the 1963 NFL draft and by the San Diego Chargers in the third round of the AFL draft. He was also drafted by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Originally, he did not think he would end up playing in Green Bay. The Chargers had a financial package of $38,000 for Robinson but ran out of money and were going to trade his AFL rights to the Buffalo Bills. Robinson's fiancée (and future wife) Elaine had been to Buffalo and knew how cold it was there, but had never been to Green Bay. Robinson would later recall that she didn't join him there until his second year in the NFL.\nRobinson made his NFL debut on September 15, 1963, against the Chicago Bears. The Packers decided to move Robinson from defensive end to linebacker. After backing up incumbent Dan Currie during his rookie season, Robinson became the starting left side linebacker for the Packers and remained in that role through 1972. Alongside the immortal MLB Ray Nitschke and Pro Bowler Lee Roy Caffey, the three formed one of the best starting units of linebackers in NFL history. Robinson was not only adept at defending the run but also against the pass. He intercepted 21 passes as a Packer, including five in 1966, which tied cornerback Bob Jeter for the team lead. Robinson played on two Super Bowl Championship teams, and won a total of three NFL titles with the Packers (1965, 1966, 1967). During that time, he developed a reputation as a big-game player. Perhaps the most notable example came in the 1966 NFL Championship game against the Dallas Cowboys. On a fourth down play from the Packers' two-yard-line, Robinson pressured Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith into a desperation pass that was intercepted by safety Tom Brown in the end zone, preserving a 34–27 victory by the Packers. Despite this, Vince Lombardi, the future Hall of Fame head coach of the Packers, was not pleased that Robinson had freelanced on the play and gave him the coach's lowest grade possible, a minus two. However, Lombardi would later privately praise Robinson for making the game-winning play.\nAfter Lombardi's retirement as Packers' head coach following Super Bowl II, the aging team went into a period of decline under new coach (and former defensive coordinator) Phil Bengtson. Individually, Robinson continued to shine. He was named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI in 1968. In 1969, he was again named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI and was also chosen for the 1st Teams of the New York Daily News, PFW and The Sporting News. Robinson suffered a setback during the 1970 season when he tore his Achilles tendon, but was ready for the start of the 1971 season. By then, Bengtson had been replaced as Packers' head coach by Dan Devine. Robinson did not get along with Devine and would later state that, while he felt that Vince Lombardi was the best coach he ever played for, Devine was his worst coach at any level: high school, college, or pros. Although the team rebounded from a 4–8–2 record in Devine's first season to finish 10–4 and win the NFC Central Divisional title, the 1972 season would be Robinson's last in a Packers uniform.\nRobinson concluded his career with the Washington Redskins in 1973 and 1974, playing under another future Hall of Fame head coach in George Allen. He later stated that he was fine with the trade to the Redskins because there was no way that he would play for Devine anymore. Robinson continued his high level of play in D.C., intercepting four passes during his first season with the Redskins. On October 14, 1973, Robinson returned one of those four interceptions 28 yards for the only touchdown of his career during a 21–3 Redskins win over the New York Giants. Robinson retired from the NFL in August 1975 after a career of twelve professional seasons. He finished his career with 27 interceptions for return yardage totaling 449 and the one aforementioned touchdown. He also recovered 12 fumbles. Robinson was named to three Pro Bowls in 1966, 1967, and 1969 and was selected for one of the linebacker spots on the NFL's all-decade team for the 1960s. In 1982, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's second HOVG class.\nAfter football.\nRobinson has pursued many different endeavors since retiring as an NFL player. During his career, he had worked in the off-season as an engineer at Campbell's Soup in Camden, New Jersey through 1967 and then for Schlitz Brewery in Milwaukee. He then worked full-time with Schlitz upon his retirement from pro football. In April 1984, he started his own beer distributorship in Akron, Ohio until semi-retiring in 2001. He then worked in sales for an artificial turf company before officially retiring in 2006. Robinson has also been a member of the Board of Directors for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Robinson was the sixth Nittany Lion in history of the program to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nRobinson and Royce Boyles co-authored \"The Lombardi Legacy: Thirty People Who Were Touched By Greatness\". In 2009, the second edition of the book was published by Goose Creek Publishers.\nIn addition to being a member of the College Football and Gator Bowl Halls of Fame, Robinson was also inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame in February 1982.\nPro Football Hall of Fame induction.\nRobinson was elected as part of the 2013 class for the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 2, 2013.\nWith his election, Robinson became the 12th member of Vince Lombardi's championship Green Bay Packers, including Lombardi himself, to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was also the sixth Penn State Nittany Lion to be honored in the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, joining Jack Ham, Franco Harris, Mike Michalske, Lenny Moore and Mike Munchak.\nIn 2011, Robinson was faced with a different struggle in his life. He was told that he may have pancreatic cancer which is 98% deadly. He said \"I had a brother die of pancreatic cancer. I know the odds of pancreatic cancer. I went home and started making plans for my demise.\" After his doctors appointment, Robinson received the news that he did not have pancreatic cancer; however he did have colon cancer and 80% blockage of one of his major arteries. But, after two months spending a lot of time in the hospital, the doctors gave Robinson news that he was cancer free and did not have to receive chemotherapy. After going through this life altering time, Robinson told reporters, \"I am here for a purpose.\"\nIn September 2013, Moorestown High School retired Robinson's old jersey, number 89. This made Robinson the only Moorestown player to ever receive such an honor."

        "title": "Fantasy golf",
        "text": "Fantasy golf is a game in which the participants assemble virtual teams of professional golfers. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant golfers are available, with games typically involving players in the US PGA Tour and the European Tour. Fantasy points are awarded based on those golfers' real-life performance in tournaments; many formats exist both for scoring and player selection.\nHistory.\nFantasy golf was one of the first fantasy sports to utilize the concept of participants selecting real-life athletes and tracking their future performance in order to earn points. In the 1950s, Oakland, California businessman Wilfred \"Bill\" Winkenbach developed a fantasy golf game in which participants would select a roster of professional golfers and compare their scores at the end of a given tournament, with the lowest combined total of strokes winning. Winkenbach is also credited with developing an early version of fantasy baseball and creating the first fantasy football league.\nA national newspaper fantasy golf game, Fairway Fantasy, was created by telecommunications company Phoneworks in 1991 following the success of other fantasy contests run by the company. In Fairway Fantasy, participants selected a roster of PGA Tour players participating in the upcoming tour event over the phone. The Phoneworks contests contributed to the widespread interconnectivity of fantasy sports that would soon encourage the development of fantasy sports over the Internet.\nDaily fantasy sports firms, such as DraftKings, began offering fantasy golf games in the 2010s. In 2015, DraftKings co-founder Matt Kalish stated that golf was the fastest-growing sport on the site aside from football, basketball, and baseball.\nAccording to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, as of 2018, around 13% of fantasy sports players in the United States and Canada play fantasy golf.\nLeague types.\nA fantasy golf league may be organized in a variety of ways. While some leagues award points based on player scores in tournament events, others rank the league's participants based upon the prize money earnings of their respective rosters. Leagues may compete across an entire year or a single tournament; under the \"one-and-done\" format, the league is contested across a full season, but each participant selects a single golfer to accrue points in each week's tournament, providing players the with opportunity to select a different golfer every week.\nSee also.\nFantasy sports"

        "title": "Terry Ryan (baseball)",
        "text": "Terry W. Ryan (born October 26, 1953) is an American professional baseball executive and former general manager for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball. Ryan was known for using a low payroll and building up the minor league system to put up contending teams. He resigned as general manager of the Twins on October 1, 2007, but returned to his former post on November 7, 2011, until being relieved of his duties on July 18, 2016. Ryan was hired as a special assignment scout by the Philadelphia Phillies on November 30, 2016.\nEarly life and career.\nRyan attended George S. Parker High School in Janesville, and was drafted in the 35th round by the Minnesota Twins in 1972.\nPlaying career.\nRyan pitched briefly in the Twins organization in the mid-70s. His playing career started with promise: Ryan posted a 10–0 record and 1.70 ERA in 43 games at Class A Wisconsin Rapids in 1973. However, he subsequently battled injuries and was released by the Twins' AA team in June 1976.\nAdministrative career.\nAfter graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1979, with a degree in physical education, Ryan quickly earned respect as an evaluator of talent in baseball. In 1980, the New York Mets hired him as a scout. He spent six seasons as a scout for the Mets before the Twins again showed interest in him. The team hired him as scouting director, a position he held for six years. He was then promoted to vice president and player personnel director under general manager Andy MacPhail. When MacPhail left for the Chicago Cubs in 1994, Ryan was chosen to replace him.\nRyan's organization relies heavily on constant scouting and analysis of every player in major and minor league baseball. As a result, the team made some startling and at the time questioned acquisitions of players who turned out to be drastically underrated and who became star players in the Twins organization.\nRyan had the unenviable task of succeeding MacPhail, architect of the Twins' 1987 and 1991 world champion teams. Ryan would endure losing seasons until 2001, but his trades turned out to have the future in mind. In 2002, the Twins began a sequence of winning their division.\nHis early years as GM had several lowlights. For example, during the 1995 season, he was forced to unload several high-priced veterans when the team was not contending. The unloaded veterans included Rick Aguilera, Scott Erickson, Mark Guthrie, and Kevin Tapani. To make matters worse, the prospects he received in these trades did not pan out. In particular, Scott Klingenbeck and Frank Rodriguez were expected to be solid major league players. Instead, they were busts who did not last in the majors.\nIn 1996, Ryan botched the signing of first baseman Travis Lee during the amateur draft. Lee exploited a never-before used clause that allows a draft pick to become a free agent if a team does not make an offer within 15 days of the draft. After the Twins failed to do this, Lee left for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who gave him a $10 million signing bonus.\nSuccess as general manager.\nThings started looking up for Ryan only a couple of months later, when he traded veteran Dave Hollins to the Seattle Mariners for a player to be named later. On September 30, the Mariners sent David Ortiz to the Twins to complete the trade. Unfortunately for the Twins, Ortiz would not show MVP-caliber numbers until he left the Twins a few years later. Similarly, in August 1997, Ryan unloaded another aging veteran for a future All-Star. This time it was Roberto Kelly for Joe Mays. In 1998, he sent the disgruntled Chuck Knoblauch to the New York Yankees for four players, including two future All-Stars: shortstop Cristian Guzman and pitcher Eric Milton. In 1999, he again unloaded Rick Aguilera and received future starter Kyle Lohse. At the end of the year, he traded for future Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana, who was picked up in the Rule 5 Draft by the Florida Marlins from the Houston Astros. In July 2001, the Twins traded outfielder Matt Lawton to the New York Mets for pitcher Rick Reed.\nPostseason success.\nRyan continued making strong trades that enable the team to remain competitive. For example, in July 2002, he traded little-used outfielder Brian Buchanan (also acquired in the Knoblauch trade) to the San Diego Padres for Jason Bartlett. That year, the team made the postseason for the first time since the 1991 World Champion team and defeated the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in the 2002 American League Division Series. After the 2002 season, the Twins organization was named Organization of the Year by \"Baseball America\" and \"SportsTicker\", while Ryan was named Executive of the Year by \"The Sporting News\".\nIn 2003, Ryan swapped outfielder Bobby Kielty for accomplished veteran leadoff hitter Shannon Stewart. This move was credited with jump-starting the team and enabling them to repeat as division champions. In November 2003, Ryan sent popular catcher A. J. Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants, gaining closer Joe Nathan, and starting pitchers Francisco Liriano and Boof Bonser. Another strong trade occurred a month later, when Ryan sent starter Eric Milton to the Philadelphia Phillies for starter Carlos Silva and infielder Nick Punto. His most recent trades affecting the current team were in December 2005, when he received second baseman Luis Castillo from the Florida Marlins for two minor leaguers. He also traded pitcher J.C. Romero to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Alexi Casilla.\nStepping down.\nOn September 13, 2007, it was announced that Ryan would be stepping down as general manager for the Twins after 12 seasons. He was replaced by assistant general manager Bill Smith, but remained in the Twins organization as a senior adviser.\nReturn in November 2011.\nOn November 7, 2011, Twins owner Jim Pohlad fired Smith after a 99-loss season - the first time that the Twins had fired a general manager since relocating from Washington, D.C. Ryan, who had remained with the team in a consultant role since stepping down as GM after the season, returned to the job, officially on an interim basis. On October 6, 2012, Ryan announced that he had removed the \"interim\" from his title and would return as Minnesota's long-term general manager for the 2013 season. On Monday, February 10, 2014, Ryan revealed that he had been diagnosed with and is being treated for carcinoma, and would miss spring training.\n2016 firing.\nRyan was relieved of his general manager duties July 18, 2016. Assistant GM Rob Antony took over as interim general manager. In joining the Phillies as a scout in November 2016, Ryan was reunited with Andy MacPhail, the Phillies' president/baseball operations since October 2015.\nHonors and awards.\nAfter he retired as general manager in 2007, Play Ball! Minnesota—sponsored by the Minnesota Twins Community Fund—renamed its highest honor, the \"Play Ball! Minnesota Award\", as the \"Terry Ryan Award\"."

The field is currently the home of the Manatees baseball team from the State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota, formerly Manatee Community College and Manatee Junior College.\nThe stadium opened in 1959 as Manatee Junior College Field. In 1977 it was renamed after Robert C. Wynn, the State College of Florida coach who started the baseball program at the college in 1959. In 2012 the field received national recognition as the only college or university this year to be awarded the prestigious American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) TURFACE Field Maintenance Award.\nIn 2007 the stadium was also briefly the home of the Bradenton Juice, of the South Coast League. However the field could not a provide the proper environment for minor league baseball. Two examples cited by league officials were the team's inability to sell beer and have post-game fireworks, due to the stadium being located on the college's campus. As a result, the attendance for the Juice games was dismal with only 148 fans attending a May 25, 2007 game at the stadium against the Macon Music. The Juice folded after the 2007 season and the league became dormant in 2008.\nThe baseball facilities were renovated during the 2010–2011 school year. The improvements included a new entrance, parking lot, batter's eye, windscreens, palm trees and foliage, as well as a net backstop with a brick knee wall."

        "text": "The Lindner Family Tennis Center is a tennis facility in Mason, Ohio. It is the home of the Western &amp; Southern Open and is owned by Tennis for Charity, Inc. The grounds include four permanent tennis stadia (Center Court, Grandstand Court, Court 3 and Court 10), distinguishing the center as the only world tennis venue, apart from the four Grand Slam venues, with more than two permanent stadia. Center Court, built in 1981 and expanded many times since, has a capacity of 11,400. Grandstand Court, built in 1995, has a capacity of 5,000. Court 3, built in 2010, seats 4,000. Court 10, built in 1997 and originally named Court 3, has a capacity of 2,000.\nIts name, The Lindner Family Tennis Center, pays tribute to the family of a former tournament sponsor, the late Cincinnati financier, Carl Lindner, Jr.\nBrowning Day of Indianapolis has been the architectural firm of record for the Center since its conception.\nHistory.\nThe location became home to the tournament now known as the Western &amp; Southern Open (or Cincinnati Masters) in 1979 when tournament organizers grew weary of perennial Ohio River flooding at its venue of the time, the Coney Island amusement park. One of the tournament sponsors, Taft Broadcasting, owned the Kings Island Amusement Park in Mason, as well as the Golf Center at Kings Island, which was located on land directly across Interstate 71 from the park. When the chairman of Taft Broadcasting, Charles Mechem, suggested the tournament move to land at the Golf Center, tournament organizers, led by Paul M. Flory, agreed.\nFour courts of DecoTurf II were initially installed at the new location, and the bleachers used at Coney Island were shipped up I-71 and placed around one of them to form Center Court. Two years later, those bleachers were removed and the first phase of construction on that court began. Enhancements to seating and amenities on Center Court have been made nearly every year since.\nOne of the biggest expansions came in 1987 when the original West Building was added, creating working space for players and media and luxury suites for fans. An expansion in 1990 added more suites and increased capacity on Center Court to 10,000. Construction in 1998 added two additional courts, bringing the total number of courts at the Tennis Center to 10.\nIn 2010, the Tennis Center was enhanced with a new \"West Building,\" now known as The Paul M. Flory Player Center in honor of the 36-year patriarch of the tournament. The new Player Center added space not only for players, but for media and fans as well. It is approximately twice as high as the previous West Building, rising above ground level and above the court level. A canopy extends over the west stands providing more covered seating. Total Center Court seating capacity was raised from 10,500 to 11,400 after the renovation.\nIn 2011 the grounds were expanded by more than 40% and six courts were added (increasing the total number of courts from 10 to 16), including Court 3 which serves as the third television court for the tournament. The expansion also included a new front entrance, entry plaza and ticket office. Harry Ewers &amp; Sons, Inc. was chosen to construct and maintain the facility tennis courts.\nIn 2012, the tournament expanded the food court and exhibit areas and also enhanced the northern entrance.\nOther events.\nThe venue also hosts the Atlantic 10 Conference Tennis Championships and the Ohio Athletic Conference Tennis Championships, and has hosted the Association of Volleyball Professionals Cincinnati professional sand volleyball tournament, special events such as concerts and Hospice of Cincinnati's annual fundraising event, and numerous national and regional high school tennis tournaments.\nIt has also hosted the Cincinnati AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Championship Series.\nSince the 2015–2016 school year, the Ohio High School Athletic Association state championship tournament has been held at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. The tournament was previously held at Ohio State University and the Elysium Tennis Center.\nReferences.\n\"From Club Court to Center Court\" by Phillip S. Smith, pages 33 &amp; 43 (2008 Edition; )."

        "title": "Alexander Wright (American football)",
        "text": "Alexander Wright (born July 19, 1967) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Raiders and St. Louis Rams. He was a two-time winner of the NFL's \"Fastest Man\" competition. He played college football at Auburn University.\nEarly years.\nWright attended Albany High School, where he focused on track and field until his senior season, when he made the football team. He played at wide receiver and cornerback, where his athletic ability allowed him to cover opposing players one-on-one without any additional support.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University. He was initially a defensive back, but because of his poor tackling and lack of run support abilities, he was moved to wide receiver as a sophomore. As a junior in his first start, he faced the University of Tennessee, tallying 3 receptions for 108 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown. In the season, he registered 12 receptions for 279 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nWright developed slowly on the offensive side of the ball and didn't see much playing time, until becoming a starter as a senior after replacing the graduated Lawyer Tillman. In the season opener against the University of the Pacific, he registered single-game school records with 263 receiving yards (52.6 average) and 4 touchdowns. Against the University of Tennessee, he collected four receptions for 129 yards and one touchdown.\nHe had an outstanding game against the University of Alabama, recording 7 receptions for 143 yards in a 30–20 victory over unbeaten Alabama, in the season finale and first Iron Bowl to be played at Jordan–Hare Stadium. After finishing the season with 30 receptions (led the team) for 714 yards (led the team) and 6 receiving touchdowns (led the team) in a ground oriented offense, he received the Shug Jordan Award as the team's outstanding senior football player.\nWright finished in the school's all-time top ten career receiving list with 56 receptions for 1,320 yards and 11 touchdowns. He still holds the record with a career average of 23.57 yards per reception. One-out-of-five of his 56 receptions went for touchdown with an average distance of over 57 yards. Of his 11 touchdown receptions, 6 were longer than 50 yards. He also scored in 4 out of the 12 times he ran a reverse run.\nHe also practiced track and field. In 1988, he won the Southeastern Conference title in both the 55 meters and the 200 meters, becoming only the second athlete in conference history to be named All-American in three events (55 meters, 200 meters and 4 × 100 metres relay). His time of 6.18 seconds in the 55 meters, at the time tied him with Bo Jackson as the sixth fastest sprinter in school history.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWright was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (26th overall) of the 1990 NFL draft, the first wide receiver to be chosen and the first pick of the round. Although he was considered a raw football player, he was also seen as a gifted athlete with elite speed.\nHe was intended to become a deep threat wide receiver, to complement running back Emmitt Smith, chosen in the first round of the same draft. As well as Smith, he also had a long (40 days) rookie contract holdout, that forced him to miss most of training camp and the first two preseason games. In the second game against the New York Giants he returned a kickoff for a 90-yard touchdown.\nIn 1991, he was a starter at wide receiver in the first 8 games, before being passed on the depth chart by rookie Alvin Harper. He displayed his talent on special teams as a kickoff returner, ranking third in the league and second in the NFC. Against the Phoenix Cardinals he had a 71-yard kickoff return. On December 22, 1991, he set the record for the longest play in Cowboys history, with a 102-yard kick off return against the Atlanta Falcons. , he and Mel Renfro are the only Cowboys with multiple kick return touchdowns.\nWright was one of the fastest players in the league, winning the NFL's \"Fastest Man\" competition in 1992 and 1993. In May 1991, he was timed to have run the 40-yard dash in 4.14 seconds. He was also the strongest wide receiver on the team.\nHe did not develop as well as expected, however, and when later asked about his performance, he admitted \"I was never a polished package\". At the end of the 1991 season, the Cowboys began looking for trade offers. On October 13, 1992, he was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick (#96-Ron Stone), when he still had no receptions following the first five games of the season.\nLos Angeles Raiders.\nWright was acquired to complement Tim Brown and Willie Gault in the team's speed-driven offense. In 1993, he became a full-time starter and had his most productive season, recording 27 receptions for 462 yards. During the final game of that season and with the Raiders trailing the Denver Broncos 23–30, he caught the game-tying touchdown pass from Jeff Hostetler and the Raiders went on to win the game 33–30, while earning a spot in the playoffs.\nIn 1994, he was sidelined for most of training camp with a calf injury he suffered in the first week of activity, but still managed to keep his starting position. During his time with the Raiders, sportscaster Chris Berman nicknamed him \"If Loving You Is Wrong I Don't Want to Be\" Wright.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nOn March 22, 1995, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Rams. A bulging disk in his lower back forced him to miss the last 8 games of the season. The next year his back problems resurfaced and he was limited to 3 games. He retired after the 1996 season, due to health reasons related to his back.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1999, Wright earned the Master of Arts in sports management from Lindenwood University. In 2002, he served as the interim head coach of the River City Renegades, a National Indoor Football League team.\nIn 2003, he served as the wide receiver coach for Francis Howell North High School in St. Charles, Missouri. In 2004, he was the wide receiver coach for West Texas A&amp;M University. In 2005, he was hired to be the offensive coordinator at Greensboro College in Greensboro, North Carolina. He was the offensive coordinator for Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie, Texas. He then took a role as the athletic director and head football coach at San Jacinto Christian Academy in Amarillo, Texas, in which he served from 2008 t o 2010. He also assisted with the track team.\nWright later moved to San Antonio for his ministry. He is the current President and CEO for Alexander Wright Ministries in Amarillo. He is also a pastor at Cornerstone Church in San Antonio."

        "title": "Fred Goldsmith (baseball)",
        "text": "Fredrick Elroy Goldsmith (May 15, 1856 – March 28, 1939) was a right-handed pitcher in 19th-century professional baseball in both the U.S. and Canada. In his prime, Goldsmith was six-foot-one-inch tall and weighed 195 pounds.\nThe Great Curveball Debate: Goldsmith or Cummings?\nInvention of the curveball is widely credited to Candy Cummings. However, another claimant was Fred Goldsmith, Cummings' rival when the two played in the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players in 1877–78—Goldsmith with the pennant-winning London Tecumsehs and Cummings with the Lynn, Massachusetts, Live Oaks. Cummings was also the first president of the International Association when he pitched for and managed the Lynn Live Oaks.\nIn his biography of Cummings, Stephen Katz describes Cummings' invention of the curveball in the early 1860s and his first known use of the pitch in 1867, when he pitched for the Brooklyn Excelsiors in a game in Cambridge, Massachusetts, against the Harvard College team.\nGoldsmith maintained that he gave a demonstration of the pitch on August 16, 1870, at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, and that renown sportswriter Henry Chadwick had covered it in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" on August 17, 1870. However, Stephen Katz, in his biography of Cummings, shows that Goldsmith's claim was not credible, and that Goldsmith's reference to an article by Chadwick in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" was likely fabricated.\nNevertheless, some writers in the first half of the twentieth century credited Goldsmith with having invented the curveball. Sportscaster-American actor Bill Stern waded into the debate in 1949 with a \"favorite story\" firmly crediting Goldsmith as the inventor and with transforming baseball. (See Bill Stern on the curveball.)\nAdditionally, an article in \"The London Free Press\" (\"Fred Goldsmith Invented The Curveball\") of June 21, 1939, credits Goldsmith with inventing the curveball and says that \"Just three days following Fred Goldsmith's death [on March 28, 1939], \"The Sporting News\" devoted an editorial to Goldsmith's feat of 61 years ago and asked that he be officially recognized as the inventor of the curve ball.\" However, \"The Sporting News\" article says no such thing. Instead, it states: \"Nearly all the authorities give the distinction of discovering and perfecting the curve ball to Cummings ...\"\nFurther, an article in the August 2, 1938, \"London Free Press\" (\"Nick Altrock Is Here For Today\") indicates that former Major League pitcher Nick Altrock also believed that Goldsmith invented the curveball. Altrock and Goldsmith were in London, Ontario, for an Old Boys Reunion and afternoon game at Labatt Park between a team from Battle Creek, Michigan, and a London Seniors team.\nIronically, Cummings was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York in 1939—the same year that Goldsmith died.\nGoldsmith's professional career.\nDuring his lifetime, Goldsmith pitched professionally for the New Haven New Havens (1875); the London Tecumsehs (in 1876, before the Tecumsehs joined the International Association) and after the Tecumsehs joined the fledgling International Association (1877–78); the Troy, New York Trojans of the National League (1879); the Chicago White Stockings of the National League (1880–1884) and briefly for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association (1884).\nPitching for the Chicago White Stockings, Goldsmith had four seasons with 20 wins or more: 1880 (21–3); 1881 (24–13); 1882 (28–17); 1883 (25–19).\nGoldsmith's win–loss percentage of .622 (112–68) does not include his games in New Haven or in London, Ontario, Canada, with the International Association pennant winners, the London Tecumsehs.\nDuring Goldsmith's five-season stint pitching for the Chicago White Stockings, he played with first baseman Cap Anson and for team President A.G. Spalding, when Chicago won several league pennants. Goldsmith's final game in the pro ranks was on September 10, 1884."

Chief Executive of the Union, Peter Thompson, said that \"A match against England, our nearest Test Nation has long been the desire of everyone associated with cricket in Ireland...\".\nEngland named a 15-man squad for both the game against Ireland and the upcoming five match ODI series against Sri Lanka.\nEd Joyce had been a crucial member of Ireland's 2005 team that secured them World Cup qualification, finishing as their top scorer in the ICC Trophy campaign. However he had decided that the tournament would be his last for Ireland as he attempted to qualify to play Test cricket for England. Joyce was ultimately successful in receiving an England call-up, although his debut would now be against the country of his birth.\nSquads.\n‡ William Porterfield was called into the squad after both Eoin Morgan and Niall O'Brien were not released by their county teams, Middlesex and Kent respectively.\nODI series.\nOnly ODI.\nEngland relied on a century from Marcus Trescothick to set an imposing target of 302 for Ireland to chase. Trescothick dominated the early partnerships with Joyce, Strauss and Collingwood failing to make significant scores. With England on 92/3 after 14 overs Trescothick was joined at the crease by Ian Bell, the two would combine for a match winning fourth-wicket stand of 142. Both would fall to John Mooney as England lost 4 wickets in the last ten overs but Geraint Jones and Glen Chapple upped the scoring rate enough to take England past the 300 mark.\nHaving lost Dom Joyce in the first over of their reply, Ireland had positioned themselves well at 60/1 after ten overs thanks to a half-century partnership between Andre Botha and Jeremy Bray. Scoring slowed down following Bray's dismissal, but Botha put together another half-century partnership with Kyle McCallan to keep Ireland in the match. The loss of 4 wickets in 4 overs to Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison took the game away from Ireland who, despite some late-order hitting, would fall short of their target."

They would have a dominating performance on the African continent at times in the years to follow. Senegal has had many world-elite basketball players, especially at the center position, which helped the team to compete at many major international tournaments.

        "title": "Paul Johnson (American football)",
        "text": "Paul Clayton Johnson (born August 20, 1957) is a former American football coach. He served as the head football coach at Georgia Southern University from 1997 to 2001, the United States Naval Academy from 2002 to 2007, and Georgia Tech, from 2008 to 2018, compiling a career college football coaching record of 189–100. Johnson's Georgia Southern Eagles won consecutive NCAA Division I-AA Football Championships in 1999 and 2000. He is noted for his use of the flexbone spread option offense.\nEarly life and education.\nJohnson earned his Bachelor of Science degree in physical education from Western Carolina University in 1979, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. He did not play college football. He also earned a Master of Science in health and physical education from Appalachian State University in 1982.\nCoaching career.\nJohnson started his college career at Georgia Southern University in 1983, where he served as offensive coordinator for consecutive NCAA Division I-AA National Football Championships teams in 1985 and 1986. From 1983 to 1986 they would win 40 games and score 619 points in 15 games in 1986. Those teams were led by QB Tracy Ham who would go on to be a successful QB in the Canadian Football League.\nHe then spent eight seasons as offensive coordinator at the University of Hawaii at Manoa from 1987 to 1994. Their offense averaged 372 points scored per season during his 8 years there and won 54 games. While at Hawaii he would coach future collegiate head coach Ken Niumatalolo. In 1992 they would finish with their best record in school history at 11–2, including a win in the Holiday Bowl over the University of Illinois. They would also win the Western Athletic Conference title that season.\nIn 1995 and 1996, he served as the offensive coordinator at the United States Naval Academy and brought his option offense with him. In 1996, Navy recorded its first winning season in 14 years, going 9–3 with a victory in the Aloha Bowl. Their 9–3 record was the best since 1978 and their 392 points scored were the most in school history up to that point.\nJohnson began his head coaching career by returning to Georgia Southern, which he led from 1997 through 2001. During his tenure, the Eagles captured the Division I-AA National Championship twice more in 1999 and 2000, and finished as runner-up in 1998. During his tenure as head coach, they finished with a record of 62–10 (86.1% winning rate).\nJohnson is one of only four coaches to record 50 wins in his first four seasons as head coach at the Division I level.\nNavy (2002–2007).\nIn 2002, Johnson departed Georgia Southern and returned to Navy as head coach. Johnson's initial season saw the Midshipmen win only two of 12 games, though the season ended on a high note with his first victory over Army, which would not beat Navy again until 2016. Subsequently, Johnson's teams enjoyed a high degree of success.\nThe 2003 team completed the regular season with an 8–4 mark, including wins over both Air Force and Army, and earned a berth in the Houston Bowl, Navy's first bowl game since 1996. However, the Midshipmen lost to Texas Tech, 38–14.\nIn 2004, Johnson's team posted the program's best record since 1957, finishing the regular season at 9–2 and once again earning a bowl berth, this time in the Emerald Bowl. There Johnson coached the Midshipmen to a win over New Mexico, 34–19, the fifth bowl win in the school's history. The win gave Navy 10 wins on the season, tying a school record that had stood since 1905. For his efforts, Johnson received the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.\nThe 2005 Navy squad recorded a mark of 8–4, highlighted by victories over Army, Air Force, and Colorado State in the inaugural Poinsettia Bowl. \nJohnson dominated the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy competition, going 11–1 (.917) in his six years, with the only loss against another service academy coming at the hands of Air Force in his first season. He was the first coach in Navy's history to go 6–0 in his first six seasons against Army (Ken Niumatalolo, who followed Johnson at Navy, went 8–0 against Army in his first eight seasons), and his 2006 senior class was the first in Navy history to win the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy all four of their years.\nMuch of Johnson's success was predicated on his triple option flexbone offense, a run-oriented attack that led NCAA Division I-A/FBS football in rushing yards three of his last four years at Navy. Some have criticized the triple option as gimmick offense unfit for major college football, which may have explained the reluctance of some top programs to offer him a position despite his accomplishments at both Georgia Southern and Navy. Johnson rebutted this argument in numerous press conferences and interviews, asserting that several top teams, including 2005 national champion Texas and 2006 national champion Florida, used various forms of the option. In 2008, Johnson told ESPN's Mark Schlabach, \"If we can run it against Boston College at Navy, why can't we run it against Boston College at Georgia Tech? If we can beat Pitt with this system at Navy, why can't we beat Pitt at Georgia Tech? Are we going to get worse players at Georgia Tech?\"\nIn 2007, he led Navy to beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1963. Navy won in triple overtime, 46-44, ending a 43-game losing streak against Notre Dame.\nGeorgia Tech (2008–2018).\nOn December 7, 2007, Johnson accepted the head coaching job at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Johnson, who came to Georgia Tech in December after a six-year tenure at Navy, inherited a young roster with reduced numbers because of an NCAA probation. Only 76 players were on scholarship, below the maximum of 85, including three senior walk-ons who were awarded scholarships prior to the start of the season. The roster included 75 freshmen and sophomores; 16 of 22 starters were underclassmen. \"Sports Illustrated\" predicted Johnson's first Yellow Jacket team would win three games and finish fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division.\nIn 2008, Johnson led the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to a 9–4 record. Georgia Tech was 6–1 at home in games played at Bobby Dodd Stadium and 4–2 against ranked opponents, including three wins in November against Florida State, Miami, and Georgia. Georgia Tech, ranked 14th in the BCS standings and 15th in the AP Poll, finished the regular season with a 9–3 record. Though they tied for first place in their division with a 5–3 conference record, the Yellow Jackets failed to advance to the ACC Championship Game by virtue of an early-season loss to eventual ACC champion, Virginia Tech. Georgia Tech accepted a bid to the Chick-Fil-A Bowl, where they were defeated by LSU, 38–3.\nJohnson's 2008 Georgia Tech team featured one first-team All-American (Michael Johnson), the ACC Player of the Year (Jonathan Dwyer), and eight first team, second team, and honorable mention All-ACC selections. On December 2, 2008, Johnson was tabbed as ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association (ACSMA). He said, \"This is an honor for the football program at Georgia Tech, the coaching staff and the players. There are a lot of great coaches in the ACC, so it's humbling to win such a prestigious honor.\" Johnson was also named 2008 National Coach of the year by CBSSports.com on the same day.\nIn 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to an 11–3 record, including the school's first win at Florida State in school history, and a victory over #4 Virginia Tech in Atlanta, which broke a 17-game home losing streak to top five opponents, and the program's first win over Virginia in Charlottesville since 1990. After a defeat at the hands of Miami in the third week of the season, Georgia Tech won its next eight games, rising as high as #7 in the AP Poll, before losing to unranked rival Georgia in Atlanta to end the regular season. Georgia Tech finished a league-best 7–1 in ACC play and defeated Clemson in the ACC Championship Game for the school's first outright conference championship since 1990. This current title has been vacated by the NCAA for rules violations, which stemmed from what the NCAA described as an isolated instance of former standout wide receiver Demaryius Thomas allegedly receiving $312 in impermissible gifts, and grew to Morgan Burnett allegedly taking gifts and misleading NCAA investigators. Both players denied these allegations and Georgia Tech filed an appeal, which was denied.\nFollowing the end of the regular season, Johnson received ACC Coach of the Year honors for the second consecutive year, becoming the only Georgia Tech head coach in history to win the award in his first two seasons. The Yellow Jackets were paired in the Orange Bowl with the 10th ranked Iowa Hawkeyes. Iowa beat Georgia Tech 24–14, sending Johnson to 0–2 in bowls at Georgia Tech.\nIn 2010, Georgia Tech started the season ranked 16th in the AP Poll. However, the team suffered a number of high-profile injuries, including to starting quarterback Joshua Nesbitt. The team finished the regular season 6–6 and lost in the Independence Bowl to Air Force 14–7.\nIn 2011, Johnson led the team to its first 6–0 start since 1990 and set a number of school offensive records in the team's 66–24 blowout of Kansas. Johnson proceeded to lose two consecutive games to Virginia and Miami before defeating then #5 Clemson 31–17. The team finished the regular season with an 8–4 record, and then lost to Utah in the Sun Bowl on December 31, 2011.\nIn 2012, Johnson's Yellow Jackets got off to a slow start at 3–5, when then defensive coordinator Al Groh was terminated by Johnson. With Charles Kelly coaching the defense thereafter, Georgia Tech won its next three games, and clinched a spot in the 2012 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte. Though the Jackets were defeated by Florida State 21–15, the Tech defense shut out the Seminoles in the second half. The Jackets finished the season with a 21–7 win over the preseason #1 team, USC, in the Hyundai Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas.\nIn 2013, Georgia Tech led Georgia 20–0 in the second quarter and 27–17 in the fourth quarter before losing 41–34 in double overtime. The Jackets finished the year 7–6 after a 23–17 loss to Ole Miss in the Music City Bowl.\nIn 2014, Johnson led Georgia Tech to their fourth Coastal Division title during his tenure and a spot in the 2014 ACC Championship Game. Johnson and the Jackets were predicted to finish sixth in the Coastal division by ESPN in the preseason, but again went beyond expectations and achieved a 10-win regular season, first place in the Coastal Division, and a 10th-place ranking in AP Poll. The Yellow Jackets fell two points short in the ACC title game to the defending national champions, Florida State, but were still selected for their second Orange Bowl berth in six seasons. The season saw the Jackets beat its key rivals Virginia Tech, Miami, Clemson and Georgia. On December 31, 2014, Paul Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to a big win in the CFP \"Big 6\" Orange Bowl. This was the second Orange Bowl Johnson's Jackets earned a bid to play. The other came against #11 Iowa on January 5, 2010. The 12th ranked Yellow Jackets dominated the game in the second half and finished their season with a 49–34 win over seventh-ranked Mississippi State. \nIn 2015, Georgia Tech had its first losing season under Paul Johnson's tenure, going 3–9 that year. However, the Yellow Jackets did beat fifth-ranked Florida State at Bobby Dodd Stadium, blocking a field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown as time expired.\nIn 2016, Johnson led Georgia Tech to a bounce-back 9–4 season. After starting 3-3, Georgia Tech won six out of its last 7, including wins against nationally ranked Virginia Tech and Georgia. They would eventually beat Kentucky in the TaxSlayer Bowl 33–18, and finished #26 in the AP Poll. \nTech had yet another disappointing season under Johnson in 2017, going 5–6. This marked the second time the Jackets missed out on a bowl game during Johnson's tenure. Georgia Tech lost five out of six games by a touchdown or less. \nIn 2018, Georgia Tech finished the regular season 7–5 with wins over ACC foes Miami and Virginia Tech. Tech also finished 2nd in the ACC Coastal Division, marking the 7th time his teams have finished in 1st or 2nd place. Johnson announced his retirement on November 28, 2018, effective following the team's bowl game against the Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson met his wife, Susan (Propst), when both were students at Western Carolina University, and they married in 1980. They have a daughter, Kaitlyn, who was born in 1993."

        "text": "The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007 took place 22 February – 4 March 2007 in Sapporo, Japan. It was the second time this city has hosted these championships, having previously done so in the 1972 Winter Olympics. Sapporo was selected as venue by vote at the 43rd FIS World Congress in Portorož, Slovenia, on 6 June 2002. It also marked the third time the championships were hosted outside Europe in a year that did not coincide with the Winter Olympics; it was the first championship held in Asia. The ski jumping team normal hill event was not held, as it had been in 2005.\nMascot.\nThe mascot of the championships was \"Norkey,\" an Ezo deer (Ezo was the former name of Hokkaidō Island in Japan) named for combining the words \"Nordic\" and \"ski\" who wears a scarf in the symbol colors around his neck.\nInitial ranks.\nAs of 16 February 2007, the top three World Cup positions were as follows:\nCross-country skiing's Tour de Ski winners were Kuitunen for the women and Angerer for the men; both got 400 World Cup points for their respective TdS victories. Jacobsen won ski jumping's Four Hills Tournament, and Manninen won Nordic combined's Tour of Germany.\nThe last officially published entry list included 485 athletes from 49 countries. This included 125 women from 33 nations and 197 men from 48 nations in Cross-country skiing, 68 men from 17 nations in Nordic combined, and 93 men from 21 nations in Ski jumping.\nParticipating nations.\n49 nations were listed on the preliminary entry list.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place on 22 February 2007 at 19:30 Japan Standard Time (JST) (10:30 UTC) at the Sapporo Dome, with 23,602 spectators. Speeches were made by Fumio Ueda, Sapporo Mayor and Organizing Committee President, Ms. Yasuko Ikenobo, Deputy Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ms. Harumi Takahashi, Governor of Hokkaido, and Prince Akishino. Then the men's and women's individual sprint cross-country skiing competitions took place.\nAttendance.\nThough the attendance on the first day of the championship, which included the opening ceremony, was nearly 30,000, the total attendance over the eleven days of the championships numbered around 90,000. Organizing Committee president Fumio Ueda admitted that the lack of good Japanese athletes – Japan only won one medal, a bronze in the ski jumping team large hill event, and the best individual finish came in the women's individual sprint with Madoka Natsumi's fifth-place finish – meant that the interest was low. FIS president Gian-Franco Kasper also said he had expected higher crowds, particularly in the cross-country skiing races on the Shirahatayama course. Several newspapers slated the low turnout in headlines: Norwegian \"Dagbladet\" called it a scandal, while Swedish \"Aftonbladet\" described it as a fiasco.\nCross-country skiing.\n\"For more detailed information, please see the article Cross-country skiing at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007.\"\nMedal table – men's cross-country skiing\nMedal table – women's cross-country skiing\nMen's Nordic combined.\n\"For more detailed information, please see the article Nordic combined at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007.\"\nMedal table\nMen's ski jumping.\n\"For more detailed information, please see the article Ski jumping at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007.\"\nMedal table\nDoping controversy.\nOn 21 February 2007, Sergey Shiryayev of Russia was involved in pre-competition testing for doping with a blood and urine sample. The blood sample in the \"A-test\" turned out high in hemoglobin, so the \"B-test\" was evaluated and confirmed to contain EPO. Shiryayev, who had his best finish of 11th in the 15 km event at the championships, was subsequently disqualified on 4 March 2007. FIS President Gian Franco Kasper expressed both disappointment in Shiriaev's doping actions and happiness in the efficiency of FIS's doping controls. At the FIS Council Meeting in May 2007 at Portorož, Slovenia, Shiryayev received a two-year ban from FIS competition (two Russian coaches were also sanctioned, by the Russian ski federation).\nPost-championship comments.\nFIS President Gian Franco Kasper expressed his thanks to the careful attention paid by FIS Vice-President (and Organizing Committee Chair) Yoshiro Ito over the detailed planning, arrangements, and execution of the championships, including television and Internet coverage. Kasper also expressed displeasure in the poor attendance of the events.\nMedal table.\nMedal winners by nation."

        "title": "FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009",
        "text": "The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 () took place 18 February – 1 March 2009 in Liberec, Czech Republic. This was the fourth time these championships were hosted either in the Czech Republic or in Czechoslovakia, having done so at Janské Lázně (1925) and Vysoké Tatry (in both 1935 and 1970).\nThe biggest sports event in the country's history, it hosted 589 athletes from 61 countries. Women's ski jumping and Men's Nordic combined 10 km mass start events debuted at these championships, both won by Americans Lindsey Van and Todd Lodwick, respectively.\nNorway won the most medals with twelve and most golds with five, all in the men's cross-country skiing events, including three from Petter Northug. Germany finished second in the total medal count with nine though none of them were gold (eight silver and one bronze). Finland finished third in the medal count with eight with three golds, all from Aino-Kaisa Saarinen in women's cross-country skiing.\nFourth in total medal count, but second in gold medal count was the United States with six, including four golds, who prior to these championships, had won only three medals in all of the previous championships combined, including four medals in Nordic combined (Lodwick: two golds, Bill Demong: one gold and one bronze). Kikkan Randall became the first American woman to medal in cross country skiing at the world championships with her silver in the individual sprint.\nBesides the debut of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10 km mass start, the Nordic combined format was changed from 7.5 km sprint and 15 km individual Gundersen to 10 km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10 km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15 km event.\nDespite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed for a day and the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.\nAttendance was between 180,000 and 200,000, twice the number at the previous championships in Sapporo, but 35 to 40 percent lower than the 2005 championships in Oberstdorf. FIS President Gian Franco Kasper commented at the closing ceremonies of the 15 nations earning medals at these championships, along with the successes of the television coverage by Czech TV and the success of the women's ski jumping at these championships would pave the way for inclusion into the 2014 Winter Olympics. A broadcast report from the European Broadcasting Union released on 4 June 2009 had total viewership of 666 million global viewers, higher than that of the 2005 championships and the 2001 championships.\nCompetition format changes.\nThe initial schedule for the competition was approved at the FIS Council meeting in Portorož, Slovenia during the weekend of 25–28 May 2007. Women's ski jumping became an official event for the first time at these championships on the normal hill which took place 20 February. This was approved at the May 2006 FIS Congress in Vilamoura, Portugal. Cross country skiing events had its classical interval start events adjusted to include a 5 km qualification event for women and a 10 km qualification for men for the women's 10 km and men's 15 km event with the top 20 finishers in each qualification advancing to the main events. These events took place 18–20 February. Nordic combined had the greatest changes in it schedule with the debut of the 10 km mass start that was also approved at the 2006 Congress in Vilamoura, and the replacement of the 7.5 km sprint and 15 km individual Gundersen events with two separate 10 km individual events. The first event, replacing the 15 km Gundersen, was a single jump from the individual normal hill followed by a 10 km cross country event using the Gundersen system while the second event, replacing the 7.5 km sprint, was a single jump from the individual large hill followed by a 10 km cross country event also using the Gundersen system. The Nordic combined changes were approved at an autumn seasonal meeting in Zürich, Switzerland, the week of 29 September 2008. Other changes listed in the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined team event was only one jump and being listed was the point-time differential at 1 point equaling 1.33 seconds.\nHistory.\n2004 – June 2007.\nThe host of the 2009 World championships was awarded at the 2004 FIS Congress in Miami, Florida, USA on 3 June 2004. The opposing candidate city to Liberec was Oslo, Norway. Norwegian Ski President Sverre Seeberg stated to the Norwegian press before the voting started that he \"thought it would be a close call, but not as close for FIS President Kasper to use his deciding vote.\" The fact this was the fourth time in a row that Liberec applied for the championships, and that it was almost 40 years since it last was arranged in Eastern Europe (1970 in Vysoké Tatry, Czechoslovakia) might give Liberec an advantage, according to Seeberg.\nLiberec was selected 11–4 over Oslo, and since there were 17 FIS members, Kasper did not vote. Seeberg was ineligible to vote, even though he served in place of the late Jan Jensen. The Oslo committee quickly announced after the loss that they would apply for the 2011 championships, which they got awarded two years later.\nPrior to being awarded the World championships in 2004, Liberec had hosted a total of 40 cross country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping competitions though it had not hosted a cross country World Cup event by June 2005. At a 24–25 May 2005 meeting, a report was given by the Liberec committee to the FIS race directors on course inspection, including layout of the courses. On 10 May 2006, a coordination group meeting was held led by Roman Kumpošt, the first organizing committee chair, regarding venue construction, television production, and construction within Liberec itself in preparation for the championships. A coordination meeting took place in Liberec 18–19 April 2007 to discuss venue information and event preparation.\nJuly – December 2007.\nCzech cross country skier and six-time Winter Olympic medalist Kateřina Neumannová was originally an honorary vice president of the organizing committee. On 25 July 2007, Neumannová was appointed as the new president of the organizing committee as approved by the organizing committee, replacing Kumpošt. She also served as a World Cup organizer for the second of the Tour de Ski events that took place in Prague on 30 December 2007. During the week of 13 August 2007, a delegation visited the FIS headquarters in Oberhofen, Switzerland and met with FIS President Kasper. This delegation included Liberec Mayor Jiří Kittner, Organizing Committee Secretary Marek Rejman, Czech Ski Association President Lukáš Sobotka, and its General Secretary Norbert Pelc, and all four confirmed the work toward the sites used for the championships were proceeding as planned with test events that occurred in February 2008. Financing issues for the event were also clarified. The next scheduled update occurred at the FIS Autumn Meeting in Zürich during the week of 24 September 2007. Progress was given by Organizing President Neumannová and Executive Director Marek Rejman while at Zürich, including updates on the venues (shown in the next section), and focused on the sports organization (including the technical directors); and the marketing and promotion of the test events. Liberec had also confirmed their support of the governmental financing for the university campus which served as the village for the teams in 2009.\n2008.\nFIS President Kasper stated that the first test weekend of 8–9 February 2008 \"went well\" in terms of sports organization. Kasper also expressed concerns about the cost for accommodation for skiing officials and media for the upcoming events. A spring coordination meeting was held the week of 7 April 2008 that discussed preparations for the event. Among the participants were FIS, the EBU, and marketing partner APF, whom focused on lessons learned from the test events held in February 2008. Coordination group members were pleased in what transpired during the February 2008 test events, including an athletes' village that was constructed at the local university. Final competition schedule was confirmed by the FIS Council in its May 2008 meeting in Cape Town, followed by a final inspection on 13 October 2008. Following the final inspection that day, a six-hour press conference was held on the status of preparations. Detailed reports were given on the test events held in February 2008 and the lessons learned from them. FIS President Kasper expressed his support of the organizing committee's efforts to present the best championships ever. Neumannová stated that the cross country skiing facility at Vesec was ready while the ski jumping facility at Ještěd was ready in the fall once construction of the access road and surrounding area was complete. The main concern of Neumannová's was the weather given the problems with the test events in February and the need for snow making equipment. The Czech government gave the organizing committee an additional CZK 189 million (€ 7.3 million) in financial support. At the end of 2008, the championships were the biggest sports event in the history of the Czech Republic. On 16 December 2008, FIS Secretary General Lewis, FIS Event and Sponsor Manager Niklas Carlsson, Neumannová, and other key Organizing Committee staff met to discuss promotional activities for the event, including ceremonies, social events, and the accreditation system. That same day, an entire inspection of the team village took place at the Technical University of Liberec where the entire complex was renovated. The students at the university left at the end of January 2009 for the teams to arrive on campus in mid-February.\n2009.\nAs of 21 January 2009, there were a total of 600 competitors from 59 nations, both Championship records. Neumannová stated that the area had about of snow at both testing areas. She also stated that Czech representatives had tested both Ještěd and Vesec and were satisfied with both areas. Free public transportation in Liberec and tram transfers from the neighboring town of Jablonec nad Nisou were organized.\nDoping programs that were successful at the previous World Championships in Sapporo continued with 78 EPO and 430 blood testing on athletes in 1–15 February period prior to the 2009 championships. 450 pre-competition blood tests were conducted with the top four finishers plus two randomly selected athletes of each event, totalling 120 for the championships. These tests were conducted by the Czech National Anti-Doping Agency with assistance of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Testing costs for the program were CHF 1.5 million.\nAs of 25 February, a total of 90,000 spectators had attended the championships. Prior to the championships, there was concern of the lack of snowfall during the championships. During the championships, there was continuing snowfall.

Additionally, 39 women from 13 countries competed in the premiere world championship ski jumping event. FIS President Kaspar hoped that the women's ski jumping event did well enough for inclusion in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\nVenues.\nAt a coordination group meeting on 18–19 April 2007 in Liberec, the event and facility preparations were discussed. A review was also done for what could have done better from the previous World Championships in Sapporo earlier that year. According to FIS Secretary General Lewis, she was pleased about the construction progress of both Ještěd (ski jumping) and Vesec (cross country skiing) and both venues were used as test events for the upcoming World Cup season. Organizing Committee chair Kumpošt stated that both venues would be completed by fall 2007 in order to ensure FIS certification. Also in attendance was the EBU and the organizing committee for the 2011 Championships in Oslo. Snowfall that started on 17 November 2008 made it possible to produce man-made snow for the event, according to Vesec cross country skiing venue manager Robert Heczko. In ideal conditions, fourteen days of snow production were required to create the needed of snow to ensure coverage of all competition courses at Vesec. Over 20 snow cannons were used in the snow-making process when temperatures dip below freezing according to Heczko.\nCross country skiing.\nThe cross country skiing venue took place at Vesec which had two 3.75 km loops in 2007. These loops were shortened to 3.3 km and 2.5 km, and then combined. Four additional loops of 1.2 km (women's sprint), 1.3 km (men's sprint), 5 km, and 7.5 km were also created. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zürich during the week of 24 September 2007, it was announced that Vesec had completed paving the courses for roller skiing and in-line skating, finalization of bridges, access roads, and permanent facilities; and installing snow-making equipment. The test event for cross country occurred during the weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because of warm weather and the lack of snow, the organizing committee was forced to bring snow from the mountains surrounding Liberec. As a result, the races were held on the paved roller skiing track. Initially on 16 February they were scheduled to be pursuit events, but were changed to interval start events. The winner of the 10 km women's event was Norway's Astrid Jacobsen while the winner of the 15 km men's event was Jean Marc Gaillard of France. Team sprint winners on the 17th were both from Norway with the ladies going to Marit Bjørgen and Astrid Jacobsen and the men going to Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Simen Østensen Snow was lacking at the cross-country course as of 16 December 2008, but organizers were ready for expected cold temperatures from Christmas 2008 onward to prepare the courses for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, about of snow had been produced using between 20 and 27 snow guns and two snow lances. Tracks were groomed, widen, and maintained in preparation of the Slavic Cup (Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia) events that took place the weekend of 17–18 January 2009. Courses were covered with snow of as of 11 February 2009. Snow reserves guaranteed the best conditions even if warm weather hit the Jizera Mountains. Closing ceremonies of the championships were held at Vesec.\nSki jumping.\nThe ski jumping venue took place at Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100 m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134 m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139 m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was gathered on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zürich during the week of 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of the ski jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs on the side of the hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.\nNordic combined.\nThe nordic combined events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping. The test event for Nordic combined occurred during the weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because of the lack of snow and warm weather prior to the test event, the schedule for the test event was adjusted to the sprint event on 15 February, the Gundersen event on 16 February, and the sprint qualification event on 17 February. The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds. Meanwhile, the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass start event won by Norway's Petter Tande. Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event's cancellation. A World Cup event leading up to the championships was to have taken place 13–14 December 2008 in the 10 km individual large hill event as a test event, but was cancelled on 6 December 2008 to warm weather and lack of snow. Neumannová stated that they had a second plan in getting snow from the Jizerske mountains higher elevations where there were better conditions for snowing. of snow at Bedřichov and Albrechtice v Jizerských horách were prepared for two nights. The third plan proposed two large parking places in the Giant Mountains with natural snow collected for use in the Vesec area. Neumannová assured everyone \"that the entire team is working very hard in order to deliver a successful FIS Nordic World Ski Championships.\" and could not wait to \"welcome all the teams, the international media, our guest, and of course, thousands of fans to Liberec in February.\"\nTipsport arena.\nThe Tipsport Arena in Liberec was used as the operational centre for the championships. This included accreditation for the athletes, location of the organizing committee support staff, an international media centre, and individual race offices. It also served as the site for the opening ceremonies of the championships.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe main winner in the cross country events was Norway with seven medals, including five golds, all in the men's events. Petter Northug of Norway won three golds, earning them in the 15 km + 15 km double pursuit, 50 km, and 4 x 10 km relay. His teammate, Ola Vigen Hattestad, won golds in the individual and team sprint events. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest winner at 38 in the men's 15 km event. Kristin Størmer Steira was Norway's only medal in the women's events with a silver in the 7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit event. For the women's events, the biggest winner was Finland's Aino-Kaisa Saarinen with four medals, including three golds (Team sprint, 10 km, and 4 x 5 km relay) and one bronze (7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit). Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk won three medals at the championships with two golds (7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit and 30 km) and a bronze (10 km). The only gold not awarded to either Kowalczyk or Saarinen was the women's individual sprint won by Italy's Arianna Follis. In that same event, Kikkan Randall became the first American woman to medal in cross country skiing at the world championships with her silver.\nMedal table – men's cross country skiing\nMedal table – women's cross country skiing\nMen's Nordic combined.\nThe United States was the big winner at these championships with four medals. Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong each won two medals with two golds for Lodwick (10 km individual normal hill, 10 km mass start), and a gold (10 km individual large hill) and a bronze (10 km individual normal hill) for Demong. Demong's disqualification in the ski jumping part of the 4 × 5 team event led to the United States withdrawal from the cross country part of the event. This led to a surprise gold medal for the Japanese in the team event, their first at the world championships in this event since 1995.\nSki jumping.\nWomen's ski jumping debuted at these championships which was won by American Lindsay Van. She was also the first North American to medal in ski jumping and the first American woman to medal at the championships. On the men's side, Austria was the big winner with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl (golds in men's individual normal hill and team large hill events) and Gregor Schlierenzauer (gold in team large hill and silver in individual normal hill events). Both Loitzl and Schlierenzauer, World Cup leaders prior to the championships, joined Switzerland's Simon Ammann in the podium of the individual normal hill event. Ammann's teammate Andreas Küttel won gold in the individual large hill event in which only one jump was performed to unstable weather conditions. Norway also won three medals in the championships with a silver in the team large hill and bronzes from Anders Jacobsen (individual large hill) and Anette Sagen (women's individual normal hill).\nMedal table – men's ski jumping\nMedal table – women's ski jumping\nClosing ceremonies.\nAt the closing ceremonies of the championships, FIS President Kasper expressed great satisfaction with the championships, stating that it was the first time that a nation without any successful national favorites (The Czech won only one medal, a silver by Bauer in the men's 15 km) had organized such a successful championship. According to Kasper, attendance reached between 180,000 and 200,000 in the 12 days of competition. The lack of snowfall concerns prior to the championships were more than made up for with continuous snowfall though that affected spectators and competitors alike. Praise was given by Kasper both to the venue managers and Czech TV for their efforts in their successful championships. 15 different nations reached the podium at the championships noted Kasper. Kasper also state the success of the women's ski jumping event will hopefully push the International Olympic Committee to include the event for the 2014 Games in Sochi with a possible team event as well. Concerning the Nordic combined 10 km mass start, Kasper stated that the event will be thoroughly analyzed as part of an overall season assessment as part of the discipline's current overhaul. Finally, Kasper wished everyone the best and looked forward to seeing everyone at Oslo for the next Nordic World Ski Championships.\nPost-event information.\nThe organizing committee for the 2009 championships met in Oslo with the organizing committee of the 2011 championships on 20 April 2009 to discuss lessons learned. In the presentation was a comprehensive and frank analysis of the critical areas of Liberec's organization. Key success factors were detailed and lessons learned were elaborated, including several recommendations to both the 2011 championships and the organizing committee for the 2013 championships in Val di Fiemme, Italy. Besides the 2009, 2011, and 2013 organizing committees in attendance, other attendees included the Norwegian Ski Federation, the European Broadcasting Union television, FIS, and the APF marketing partners.\nOf the 73 skiers who won medals at these championships, 34 of them would medal at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver the following year. Three of the skiers who won the world championships in their respective events, Bill Demong in the nordic combined 10 km individual large hill, Justyna Kowalczyk in the cross-country skiing women's 30 km, and Petter Northug in the cross-country skiing men's 50 km, would win Olympic gold in those same events.\nMedal table.\nTop nations.\nMedal winners by nation.\nTop athletes.\nAll athletes with two or more medals."

        "text": "The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011 took place from 23 February to 6 March 2011 in Oslo, Norway, at the Holmenkollen National Arena. It was the fifth time these championships had been hosted in Holmenkollen, having been done previously in 1930, the 1952 Winter Olympics, 1966, and 1982. On 25 May 2006, the 45th FIS Congress in Vilamoura, Portugal, selected the Holmenkollen area over both Val di Fiemme, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, with a vote of 12 to 4 to 0. These games coincided with the Holmenkollen Ski Festival as they have previously in 1930, 1952, 1966, and 1982.\nCross-country skiing was dominated by Norway; Marit Bjørgen won four gold and one silver, while Petter Northug won three gold and two silver. Canada, with Devon Kershaw and Alex Harvey took its first-ever victory with gold in the men's team sprint. Austria dominated the ski jumping, winning all five events: Thomas Morgenstern took three golds and one silver, Gregor Schlierenzauer won three golds, and Daniela Iraschko won the women's event. In the Nordic combined, Germany took four of the six individual medals, but lost both relays to Austria.\nOrganization.\nIn 2002, the Association for the Promotion of Skiing and Oslo Municipality started the process of applying for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009. The city council decided to grant NOK 52.8 million to upgrade Holmenkollen, including Holmenkollbakken, for the 2009 World Championships. Oslo lost the vote in the International Ski Federation (FIS) against Liberec, Czech Republic, on 4 June 2004. The Norwegian Ski Federation subsequently stated that they would apply for the 2011 World Championships. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing stated that they wanted a new hill in Rødkleiva instead of expanding the existing ski flying hill in Vikersund, Vikersundbakken. Holmenkollbakken would then be used for the last time during as a large hill during the 2011 World Championships, and would then converted to a normal hill. In May 2005, the general assembly of the Norwegian Ski Federation voted to build a new ski flying and normal hill in Rødkleiva ahead of the 2011 World Championships. Following Vikersundbakken being awarded the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2012 in 2008, the general assembly of the Norwegian Ski Federation that year decided to terminate the plans for a ski flying hill in Rødkleiva.\nOn 22 September 2005, FIS stated that an all-new Holmenkollbakken would have to be built if Oslo was to host the world championships and World Cup tournaments. FIS stated that similar reconstructions had been done with Schattenbergschanze in Oberstdorf, Germany, and Bergiselschanze in Innsbrück, Austria. In December 2005, the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage gave permission for the tower to be demolished, on the condition it was replaced by a new in-run with a similar architectural quality and retain its function as a landmark. They stated that it was the activity itself that is worthy of preservation, not the structure itself. The city council made the final decision to apply for the world championships and build a new hill on 1 March 2006. A new hill was at the time estimated to cost NOK 310 million, and the state was willing to finance NOK 70 million of those. Oslo was awarded the 2011 World Championships in May 2006.\nThe municipality issued an architectural design competition to rebuild the hill; Julien De Smedt's proposal was selected among 104 entrants. At the time, it was estimated that the new national arena would cost NOK 653 million. Demolition of Holmenkollbakken started on 16 October 2008. The World Cup tournament in 2009 was held at Vikersundbakken instead of Holmenkollen because of the reconstruction. When the decision to reconstruct the national arena was made by the city council in 2007, it was estimated to cost NOK 653 million. By 2008, the cost had accelerated to NOK 1.2 billion, and by the following year it had reached NOK 1.8 billion. City Commissioner For Business and Culture, Anette Wiig Bryn of the Progress Party, had to leave her position because of the cost overruns. A consultant report ordered by the municipality concluded that the pressure to find cost savings to stay within the budget, which was underestimated to start with, resulted in slower progress, which again resulted in higher costs. The costs of the new large hill were NOK 715 million, while total costs for the upgrade of the national arena and infrastructure ended at NOK 2,426 million. This included the construction of a new ski stadium next to Holmenkollbakken, and Midtstubakken, and upgrades to the Holmenkollen Line.\nVenue.\nHolmenkollbakken is a large ski jumping hill with a hill size of 134 and a construction point (K-spot) of 120. It has a spectator capacity for 30,000. The current structure dates from 2010 and consists of a tall superstructure. The top of the structure is above mean sea level. It is the first hill in the world with a permanent wind screen, which is able to restrain 45 to 50 percent of the wind. Midtstubakken is a normal hill with a hill size of 106 and a K-point of 95. It has a capacity for 16,000 spectators and was completed in 2010.\nMedal ceremonies were held at Universitetsplassen, a square in the city center.\nTransport is based on that no spectators will use private cars to the venue. Instead, all spectators must use the Holmenkollen Line of the Oslo Metro. Holmenkollen Station is located within walking distance of the large hill and cross-country stadium, while Midtstuen Station is closest to Midtstubakken. Holmenkollen Station is the only one on the line with platforms long enough for six cars, which allows a capacity of 9,000 per hour. \"Chaotic\" and \"spectators stood in line for many hours to get into the arena\" and \"sheep are treated better\", were some of the claims by Verdens Gang, in regards to the treatment of spectators on 26 February. A number of people were not admitted into the arena (in time to see Marit Bjørgen win) on 26 February. The director of the event, promised that the organizers would refund some tickets, after reviewing individual claims.\nOrganizing committee (VM 2006–2011 AS).\n2006.\nIn the 6 September 2006 edition of the FIS Newsflash, the first orientation meeting of the local organization took place in Oslo on 4 September 2006. Included in the meeting were representatives from the Norwegian Ski Association, the FIS, Skiforeningen (The Holmenkollen organizing committee), NRK (Norwegian TV), and the European Broadcasting Union. Discussions involved were liaisons among the various groups, marketing of the event, arena and ski jump reconstruction, and testing of the new constructed sports arena that is scheduled for completion in 2010. Åsne Havnelid was appointed as chief executive officer of the event during the week of 2 July 2007, starting on 1 September 2007. The first official coordination group of Havnelid, Adelheid Sæther as Chief Operations Officer, and Stein Opsal as chief financial officer officially met on 13 November 2007. One of the key items discussed was the updated plans for the Holemkollen ski jump and the FIS requirements for the future of the ski jump. Construction of the ski jump has not started with the Oslo City Government and the City Council having review the project in more detail, especially the costs involved. In an August 2008 interview, Hanevild stated that the attendance goal for the championships was 400,000. During the week of 15 September 2008, it was reported that team is developing working practices and responsibilities of the different committee roles.\n2007.\nSki-vm 2007\n2008.\nSki-vm 2008\n2009.\nThe organizing committee for the 2009 championships in Liberec met in Oslo with the organizing committee of the 2011 championships on 20 April 2009 to discuss lessons learned. In the presentation was a comprehensive and frank analysis of the critical areas of Liberec's organization. Key success factors were detailed and lessons learned were elaborated, including several recommendations to both the 2011 championships and the organizing committee for the 2013 championships in Val di Fiemme, Italy. Besides the 2009, 2011 and 2013 organizing committees in attendance, other attendees included the Norwegian Ski Federation, the European Broadcasting Union television, FIS, and the APF marketing partners. At a coordination group meeting in Oslo on 3–4 September 2009, construction progress was shown on the ski jumps at Holmenkollen and Midstuen along with the renovations for the cross-country stadium and tracks. Given current construction, the organizing committee states that World Cup events will go as planned for March 2010 to serve as test events for the 2011 championships. As of September 2009, the organizing committee employed 20 people while host broadcaster NRK are taking advantage of the 3-D modeling for perfect camera angles for the event that will take place in February–March 2011. On 23 December 2009, the organizing committee announced that Statoil, an energy company based in Stavanger, will be joining Aker Solutions, Intersport, and Swedish-based Craft as a sponsor to the championships.\n2010.\nTest events at the Holmenkollen took place the weekend of 12–14 March 2010 in all three disciplines. Prior to the competition, the organizing committee entered a deal where a Nissan dealership in Oslo supplied 33 vehicles during the test events. Switzerland's Simon Ammann, who won gold medals in both individual ski jumping events at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver the previous month, won the ski jumping test event on 14 March. Nordic combined has two test events that took place with the Norwegian team of Petter Tande, Mikko Kokslien, Jan Schmid and Magnus Moan winning the team event on the 13th while France's Jason Lamy Chappuis, gold medalist in the 10 km individual normal hill event at the 2010 Winter Olympics, won the 10 km individual large hill test event on the 14th. For the cross-country events held that weekend, Norway's Marit Bjørgen, who won five medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics, won both the sprint and the 30 km events. In the men's cross-country events, the sprint was won by Norwegian Anders Gløersen while the 50 km was won by Gløersen's fellow countryman Petter Northug.\nOn 15–16 April 2010, the 2011 Coordination Group met in Oslo after the broadcasters' meetings. Among items discussed were the organizational review from the World Cup held at the Holmenkollen the previous month along with that of success of the ski jump following its renovation.

        "title": "Robert Lebel (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Robert Lebel or LeBel (September 21, 1905 – September 20, 1999) was a Canadian ice hockey administrator, who served as president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Lebel founded a senior ice hockey league during World War II, and then became president of the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA). He was a mayor of Chambly, Quebec, before joining the CAHA as an executive member and later its president. He was president of the IIHF during the early Cold War era, the last Canadian to lead the federation. He later founded the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for junior ice hockey players. He received the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the IIHF Hall of Fame, three halls of fame in his native Quebec, and is the namesake of the Robert Lebel Trophy.\nEarly life.\nLebel was born September 21, 1905, in Quebec City, Quebec. He played junior ice hockey as a goaltender in the Beaupre Shore junior hockey league. He later played in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and several amateur hockey teams in New York state. After retiring from playing, Lebel was a referee for nine seasons, and briefly coached with the Montréal-Nord Crescent Club in the Intermediate Hockey League.\nLebel graduated from the Quebec City Commercial Academy. He later worked as a bank teller and a bookkeeper at the Bank of Montreal branch in the Château Frontenac. He subsequently worked with the Huguenot Trust Company in New Rochelle, New York, for a year.\nBeginnings in Quebec.\nLebel began his career as a hockey administrator when he founded the Interprovincial Senior Hockey League in 1944, and he served as its president until 1947. The league included many players stationed at RCAF Station Lachine during World War II. He also served as president of the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA) from 1945 to 1946, and again from 1951 to 1955. He relocated to Chambly, Quebec, in 1951 and became vice president of Bennett Limited. In June 1955, his term as QAHA president ended, and he was replaced by Lionel Fleury. Lebel then became president of the Quebec Amateur Hockey League from 1955 to 1957. At the same time, Lebel entered municipal politics in 1955, and served as the mayor of Chambly until 1957. During his time as mayor, he initiated the construction of a water treatment facility for the greater Chambly area, completed in 1959.\nCanadian amateur hockey.\nLebel served as first vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1955 to 1957 under president Jimmy Dunn, and then succeeded him as president from 1957 to 1959, when he was followed by Gordon Juckes. When he was elected CAHA president on May 29, 1957, he became the first French Canadian to lead the country in hockey. When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened its first permanent building in 1961, Lebel represented the CAHA on its governing committee. He remained in that position for 17 years, and was made a trustee of the George Richardson Memorial Trophy, and the W. G. Hardy Trophy.\nInternational ice hockey.\nLebel became president of the International Ice Hockey Federation in July 1960; he was the second and most recent Canadian to hold the position since W. G. Hardy was elected in 1948. Lebel served as IIHF president until 1962. Due to a fear of flying, Lebel preferred a transatlantic crossing by sea, when attending federation meetings in Europe.\nDuring the third year of his tenure as president, he was embattled by the Cold War on ice. The 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships were scheduled for Colorado Springs, Colorado, for the first world championship hosted in the United States, and also the first to be played after the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Lebel warned that there would be sanctions if the West Germany team refused to play the East Germany team as had happened in the previous year's championships. Prior to the 1962 event, the East German team were denied travel permits by the Allied Travel Bureau, so they were prevented from getting travel visas to the United States. In response, Lebel reiterated that East Germany was a member in good standing with the IIHF, entitled to play at the event, and that the IIHF would do everything in its power to enable East Germany to travel. The Soviet Union subsequently withdrew in protest, which began speculation of an Eastern Bloc boycott of the event. Lebel declined requests to relocate the event, said that it would go on as planned, and appealed to the travel bureau on behalf of the East Germans. He also denied a motion by the Soviets to remove the European Championship and World Championship statuses from the event, since the motion violated the IIHF constitution. Canada wanted to use former professionals at the event, but Lebel defended the IIHF decision to exclude players reinstated as amateurs after September 1, 1961, even though it worked against many Canadian players. Lebel was satisfied with the overall event including 14 teams despite the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia not attending. After the event, Soviet news agency TASS called for Lebel to be replaced at the IIHF, and for measures put in place to prevent politics in sports.\nLebel said that once his term expired, it would be Europe's turn for the presidency. He later sat on the North American board of the IIHF. He was also appointed to the national advisory council on fitness and amateur sports, by health minister Judy LaMarsh on March 5, 1964. Lebel resigned his IIHF council post in May 1964. He agreed that Bunny Ahearne, his successor as president of the IIHF, was correct in his decision to place Canada fourth at the 1964 World Ice Hockey Championships, according to IIHF statutes.\nReturn to Quebec hockey.\nLebel returned to hockey in Quebec, and in 1969, he facilitated the merger of the Quebec Junior Hockey League with the Metropolitan Montreal Junior Hockey League, forming the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He was later installed as the founding president of the league. He retired from his position with Bennett Limited in Chambly, in 1971. He presided over the QMJHL until 1975, when he retired from a career as a hockey administrator. He was named an honorary president of the league in 1975.\nHonours and awards.\nWhile Lebel was president of the CAHA, he received the AHAUS Citation Award in 1958, for his contributions to the advancement of American amateur hockey, and received the Ontario Hockey Association Gold Stick award in 1959. In 1964 after completing his IIHF service, he was made a life member of both the CAHA, and the QAHA. While with the QMJHL in 1970, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.\nLebel was inducted into the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. When the Hockey Québec Hall of Fame opened in 1991, he was among the first class of inductees. In 1992, he received the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal for significant contributions to the community, and Canada. He was the inaugural inductee into the QMJHL Hall of Fame, on September 6, 1995. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame as a builder, in the inaugural class of 1997. Lebel was also made an honorary life member by USA Hockey.\nLebel played golf competitively. He won titles at the Kent Golf Club, the Sherbrooke Open and the Bank of Montreal Open.\nDeath and legacy.\nLebel lived in Chambly after retiring, at 26 Saint-Pierre St. He died at home on September 20, 1999, on the eve of his 94th birthday. He was predeceased by his wife Lucille Bégin in 1987, and survived by his son Jean, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. The city flag at town hall was lowered to half-mast for a week, until his burial on September 27, at the St. Joseph Church cemetery in Chambly.\nIn the 1990s, Lebel donated the Emma Albani fund for musical arts to the town of Chambly. The \"Journal de Chambly\" remembered Lebel as being an authoritarian when he was younger, then later in life as sympathetic but direct. He was also known for his wit, and being outspoken. The Réseau des sports described Lebel as being both frank and generous.\nThe town of Chambly renamed the municipal sports centre in honour of Lebel on September 14, 1976. The Centre Sportif Lebel includes indoor and outdoor skating rinks. After his death, the town named a boulevard for Lebel.\nThe Quebec Major Junior Hockey League renamed its west division to the Lebel division for the 1976–77 QMJHL season. The league also created the Robert Lebel Trophy in the 1977–78 QMJHL season, awarded to the team with the best goals against average."

        "text": "Roydon John Masters AM (born 15 October 1941) is an Australian sports journalist and former rugby league football coach. He is a sports columnist for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\". He was a school teacher with an interest in team psychology who enjoyed some success as a schoolboy coach before embarking on a professional coaching career in the NSWRFL Premiership.\nFamily and early life.\nRoy was the eldest of seven children to author and journalist Olga Masters and her school teacher husband. His siblings include current affairs journalist Chris Masters, Ian Masters, a Los Angeles radio show host, Quentin Masters, a London-based film producer, Sue Masters television Producer and Deb Masters.\nCoaching.\nMasters had little experience as a professional rugby league footballer having played country football as a of, \"only average ability \" during his early teaching years at Tweed River High. He qualified as a teacher in 1963 and following posts at Tweed River and Armidale, Masters taught at Tamworth High School and coached their rugby league side to victory in the prestigious University Shield schoolboys competition. In 1972 he was selected as coach of the inaugural Australian Schoolboys representative side which featured such future stars as Ian Schubert, Craig Young, Les Boyd and Royce Ayliffe. The side toured Great Britain, going undefeated on the tour and scoring 108 tries in their 11 games to their opponents one.\nMasters' senior coaching career in the NSWRL commenced with a minor role with the Penrith Panthers in 1974 as one of five members of the coaching panel. At the time he was still a social science teacher at Doonside High School. In 1976 he shifted to the Western Suburbs Magpies to coach their under 23s side when Don Parish was the head coach.\nIn 1978 he was appointed as head coach largely due to the support of senior players Tommy Raudonikis and Les Boyd. Masters re-built the Magpies, who had been in decline since suffering three successive grand final losses to St George from 1961 to 1963. He coached the Magpies to a minor premiership in 1978 and they played with consistent high quality during this period. Many acclaimed players blossomed under his tutelage, including Boyd, John Dorahy and John \"Dallas\" Donnelly; while the tough, uncompromising halfback Tommy Raudonikis led the side on-field.\nMasters was a master of psychology, famously terming the Western Suburbs the \"fibros\" (a type of asbestos sheeting commonly used in houses in the area) in contrast to their rivals of the period the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, whom he described as the \"silvertails\". This reflected both the socio-economics of the respective Sydney suburbs and the financial situations of the clubs. He created this term after a fiery exhibition match between the two sides in Melbourne when Masters was happy to spread a false rumour that the Sea Eagles had stayed at a luxury resort while Wests had to make do with a two-star hotel.\n\"I've been a battler all my life. I can communicate with a team like Wests. I form a close personal relationship with each of my players because I'm one of their kind.\" Masters said of his time at the club. Masters left Western Suburbs when it emerged that the Magpies' affiliated leagues club at Ashfield would no longer be able to support the incomes of his key \"fibros\" players.\nMasters moved on to St. George Dragons in 1982, reaching the Grand Final in 1985 but losing to Canterbury-Bankstown 7–6. Masters is regarded as one of the finest coaches to have never won a premiership because he was seemingly able to help financially struggling clubs to perform above their ability. He was awarded the Dally M coach of the year in 1985.\nIn September 2004 Masters was named as coach of the Western Suburbs Magpies team of the century.\nJournalism.\nMasters is a columnist at \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", and also appears on the ABC-TV sports panel show \"Offsiders\". He was also a Rugby League Commentator for Channel Seven when the Seven network had the free to air TV rights for Australian Tests from 1990 to 1993.\nMasters did not support Super League when it emerged in 1995 and is well known for his support for rugby league traditions. He is also respected for his analytical skill, and is highly regarded by current players, a rarity for a member of the media.\nMasters also covers soccer, boxing and a variety of other sports, famously criticising American jingoism at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games.\nHe is a strong supporter of John O'Neill, the Australian Rugby Union chief executive (and former Football Federation Australia CEO) who led the federation to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, Masters has criticised FFA chairman Frank Lowy in a series of articles detailing Australian soccer's financial problems, in spite of the Socceroos' success at the World Cup. He questioned whether Lowy, Australia's second richest man, would repay an Australian Sports Commission loan of over A$3 million, to help develop a national league. In a letter to the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", Lowy questioned Masters' journalistic credibility, saying among other things that Masters was a \"Rugby League commentator\". Masters then revealed that his great uncle James \"Judy\" Masters was a former captain of the Australian national team.\nIn 2005 Masters gave the 7th annual Tom Brock Lecture. He also made an appearance in the 2007 rugby league drama film \"The Final Winter\". In 2012 he was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for services to sport and journalism.\nWhilst continuing to write articles for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", in 2010 Masters released a book, \"Higher, Richer, Sleazier: How Drugs and Money Are Changing Sport Forever\".\nIn 2011, he was awarded Australian Sports Commission Media Award for Lifetime Achievement."

        "title": "Michael O'Connor (rugby)",
        "text": "Michael David O'Connor (born 30 November 1960) is an Australian former rugby league and rugby union footballer who represented Australia in both codes. He played for the Wallabies in 13 Tests from 1979 to 1982 and then the Kangaroos in 17 Tests from 1985 to 1990. O'Connor played club football in the NSWRL Premiership for the St. George Dragons from 1983 until 1986, and later the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles from 1987 until his retirement at the end of 1992, becoming captain of Manly in 1990, as well as winning the 1987 Winfield Cup with the Sea Eagles.\nRugby union.\nRaised in Canberra O'Connor attennded Phillip College. He was selected and toured with the undefeated Australian Rugby Union Schoolboys tour of Europe and Japan in 1977-78 alongside the likes of the Ella brothers Mark, Glen and Gary, as well as Queenslanders Wally Lewis and Chris Roche. His club rugby career was with the Canberra Royals and then Brisbane club, Teachers-Norths.\nHe was first selected for the Wallabies in 1979.\nWith a number of those players he was a young starter in the 1980 Wallaby side which won the Bledisloe Cup in Sydney in the 3rd and deciding game that year. O'Connor scored a try in this game marking his ascendancy in representative rugby and coinciding with a rebirth of Australian rugby and the beginning of a golden period through to the Grand Slam achievement of 1984.\nHe made 13 Wallaby appearances at Centre up till the July 1982 Test against Scotland.\nRugby league.\nSt. George 1983–86.\nO'Connor switched to rugby league, signing with New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership side, St George in 1983.\nHe made his First Grade début from the bench for the Dragons in Round 3 of the 1983 season against Western Suburbs at Kogarah Oval, scoring a try on debut. O'Connor, who would go on to be a goal kicker of note and would notch up almost 1,500 points in his club and representative career, did not kick a goal for St. George during his first two seasons at the club, with coach Roy Masters preferring Steve Gearin and Steve Rogers in the role (unlike O'Connor who was one of the newer style around-the-corner kickers, Gearin and Rogers were both front on kickers which often led to less accuracy). Following their departure from the club after 1984 (where O'Connor and 24 test veteran Rogers played in the Dragons' Reserve Grade Grand Final side that lost to Balmain), O'Connor would be the Dragons first choice goal kicker in 1985, kicking 81 goals on his way to 189 points for the season (also scoring 6 tries and kicking 3 field goals).\nO'Connor was part of St. George's 1985 Grand Final team that lost to Canterbury-Bankstown in front of 44,569 at the SCG. O'Connor kicked the only goal for the Dragons, a conversion of a \"Slippery\" Steve Morris try as they went down in a thriller 6–7. A field goal by Bulldogs winger Andrew Farrar being the difference between the two sides.\nRepresentative.\nO'Connor made his representative début when he was selected for City Firsts for the annual City vs Country game in 1985. After impressing with 3 goals and his general play in City's 18–12 win over Country Firsts at Newcastle's International Sports Centre, O'Connor was selected to make his State of Origin début for New South Wales in Game 1 of the 1985 State of Origin series. Heavy rain confronted the players at Lang Park when the teams took the field for the opening match of the series. O'Connor scored two tries and kicking five goals to finish with all 18 of the Blues' points.\nA week before he was selected for NSW for the first time, O'Connor was hit in an accidental high tackle from Canterbury-Bankstown's Steve Mortimer in a club match at Belmore, leaving him with a broken nose (and contributing to his nickname of \"Snoz\"). The Bulldogs half-back was cited over the incident but received support from O'Connor at the league judiciary when he concurred with Mortimer's explanation that his arm had come up from off the ball when he made the tackle and that there was no intent of a high shot. During Game 2 of the 1985 State of Origin series at the Sydney Cricket Ground, O'Connor kicked 4 goals and his only field goal in Origin football as NSW won 21–14 in front of the then biggest crowd in Origin history of 39,068 fans. \nFollowing his performances for NSW in the first two games of the 1985 Origin series, O'Connor was selected for the mid-season tour of New Zealand. Though he didn't play in a test match, he did play in the minor games of the short tour. Controversy reigned in early 1987 following the release of a biography of Australian and Queensland captain Wally Lewis titled \"King Wally\" when 1985 NSW and Australian coach Terry Fearnley had been quoted as allegedly saying about O'Connor during the 1985 tour \"Can't play. No Heart. Lucky he can kick goals or he wouldn't be here\".\nO'Connor's international rugby league début in the first test of the mid-season Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand on 6 July 1986 at Auckland's Carlaw Park saw him become Australia's 37th dual code rugby international following Ray Price and preceding Ricky Stuart. Playing on the , Snoz kicked 3 goals in a 22-8 Australian win. He then went on to kick 4 goals as Australia wrapped up the two match series 2–0 with a 29–12 win at the SCG. With his natural pace and great side-step, many of his international rugby league appearances were on the wing, such was the depth of Australia's three-quarter talent with players like Gene Miles, Brett Kenny, Mal Meninga, Dale Shearer, Tony Currie, Andrew Ettingshausen and Mark McGaw available to the selectors during his era, though he did play most of his State of Origin career in his preferred centre position.\nO'Connor was a selection for the 1986 Kangaroo Tour and played in all 6 tests on tour, including the pre-tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby, where he scored 22 points from 2 tries and 7 goals in a 62–12 win. He was the leading point scorer on tour for the Kangaroos with 170 from 13 tries and 59 goals from his 14 games played.\nO'Connor scored a personal tally of 44 points in the 3-0 Ashes series victory over Great Britain, including 22 in the first test at Old Trafford where he scored 3 tries and kicked 5/9 goals in tricky conditions. He then played the final two tests on tour against a hapless French side, scoring 20 points (3 tries, 4 goals) in the 44-2 first test win at Perpignan and 16 points (1 try, 6 goals) in the 52-0 second test win at Carcassonne. \nManly-Warringah 1987-92.\nBefore the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, O'Connor signed with the Bob Fulton-coached Manly-Warringah club.\nO'Connor started playing for Manly from 1987 and starred in their 18-8 1987 NSWRL season's Grand Final win over the Canberra Raiders O'Connor scored 14 of Manly's 18 points with a try in the second half (and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Following the 1987 grand final victory he travelled with the champion Manly side to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against the 1986–87 RFL champions, Wigan at their home ground, Central Park. In front of 36,895, Wigan won an ultimately try-less game 8–2, with Manly's only points coming from a penalty goal from O'Connor. Despite being Manly's first choice kicker for the Grand Final, O'Connor generally shared the kicking duties with Mal Cochrane and only scored 129 points for the season in 21 games (Cochrane scored 138 from 25 games). \nAt the end of the 1992 Winfield Cup season, as captain of Manly, O'Connor announced his retirement from playing. O'Connor was rated the 50th best Australian rugby league footballer of all time in a \"Rugby League Week\" Special in 1992.\nRepresentative.\nDuring 1987, O'Connor played both in the centres and on the wing for New South Wales in their 2-1 State of Origin series loss to Queensland where he scored 2 tries and kicked 5 goals for the series. He was then selected to play on the wing in Australia's 13–6 loss to New Zealand in the one-off test at Lang Park. In 1987, there was a 4th 'Exhibition' State of Origin game played in August. This game was played in Long Beach, California at the Veterans Memorial Stadium. Playing in the centres, O'Connor scored 1 try and kicked 5 goals for the Blues who won convincingly 30–10.\nO'Connor scored tries in all three matches of the 1988 State of Origin series, which Queensland won 3-0 for the first time, despite two of the three games being played in Sydney. On 20 July 1988 O'Connor played on the wing for Australia in their record 62-point win over Papua New Guinea, scoring four tries and kicking 7 goals to set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league. Of his 18 tests, O'Connor only played three games at centre, all three during the 1988 Ashes series against the Great Britain Lions following the international retirement of Kenny, and the unavailability of both Miles and Meninga with injury. He was then chosen at centre for the Ashes series against the touring Great Britain side, the Australians winning the series 2–1.\nFollowing the end of the 1988 season in which Manly were bundled out in the semi-finals, O'Connor and Dale Shearer were the only Manly players chosen for Australia's World Cup Final team to play New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. O'Connor (playing on the wing) kicked 4/7 goals as Australia won 25-12 to win their 5th Rugby League World Cup. \nDuring the 1989 NSWRL season, O'Connor was selected for Game 3 of the 1989 State of Origin series, which saw Qld record its second straight 3-0 series win, and 8th straight game win in a row, with a 36–16 win at Lang Park. Following this he was selected for Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand where he played in all three Trans-Tasman Tests against the Kiwis as the Bob Fulton coached Aussies won 3–0.\nO'Connor's last test for Australia was in 1990. Playing on the wing on a freezing night at the Pioneer Oval in Parkes (NSW), O'Connor, as did the other Australian goal kickers used (captain Mal Meninga, an on début Laurie Daley, and former Manly teammate Dale Shearer), had an off-night with the boot, missing all three of his conversion attempts. Injury then ruled him out of the test against New Zealand in Wellington two months later. \nFollowing the 1990 NSWRL season, in which he had taken over the captaincy of the Sea Eagles following Paul Vautin's move to Eastern Suburbs, O'Connor ruled himself out of contention for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour because of a recurring hamstring injury.\nO'Connor is remembered in State of Origin folklore for a sideline conversion for NSW in teeming rain only minutes out from the final siren to win the 2nd game of the 1991 State of Origin series 14–12 win over Qld at the Sydney Football Stadium. Despite no longer being the regular kicker for Manly due to the signing of goal kicking former All Blacks fullback Matthew Ridge, and despite the presence in the NSW team of regular club kickers Greg Alexander (Penrith) and Rod Wishart (Illawarra), Blues coach Tim Sheens gave the kicking duties to O'Connor for the series and his lack of match kicking practice showed, kicking only 3/9 for the series, all three goals coming in Game 2 in Sydney. The 1991 Origin series was the last time Michael O'Connor represented NSW.\nDuring the third and final game of the 1991 State of Origin series, O'Connor was hit in a high tackle from Queensland centre Mal Meninga in the sixth minute, leaving him with a broken nose and two black eyes. Despite the riot act being read to both teams after a fiery Game 2, the NSWRL failed to cite Meninga for the incident and O'Connor was forced to accept an apology from him (at the time Meninga was the reigning Australian captain and there was the Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand starting a month later).\nSt Helens.\nO'Connor and Manly captain Paul Vautin travelled to England to play for the Alex Murphy coached St. Helens for a short spell during 1988–89, but his performances were largely disappointing, culminating in the side's 27–0 1989 Challenge Cup Final defeat at Wembley Stadium against Wigan. It was the first time in Cup Final history that a team had been held scoreless. O'Connor took Dave Tanner's place from the side that had played in the 16–14 Semi-final victory over Widnes.\nPost playing career.\nO'Connor served as head coach of the Australian men rugby sevens team from 2008 to 2014. He coached the team to a silver medal at the Rugby sevens at the 2010 Commonwealth Games."

        "title": "Non-international England cricket teams",
        "text": "In English cricket since the first half of the 18th century, various \"ad hoc\" teams have been formed for short-term purposes which have been called England (or sometimes \"All-England\"; i.e., in the sense of \"the rest of England\") to play against, say, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) or an individual county team. The key factor is that they were non-international and there is a significant difference between them and the official England cricket team which takes part in international fixtures. Conceptually, there is evidence of this sort of team being formed, or at least mooted, since the 1730s. They have always been \"occasional elevens\" but, nevertheless, have invariably been strong sides. A typical example would be a selection consisting of leading players drawn from several county teams.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe earliest known mention of the concept occurs in a report by the \"London Evening Post\" of 7 to 9 September 1734 which states that the London Cricket Club, being \"desirous of playing one more match before the season is expired, do challenge to play with any eleven men in England\". The challenge excluded members of Croydon Cricket Club, with whom London were in dispute. It is possible that challenges of this sort had been issued previously but no records of them have been found. There had been matches involving, for example, a team representing one county against a team bearing a patron's name and it is possible that teams of the latter type included players from a wide geographical area. In the 1730s, \"any eleven men in England\" would in practice have come from the southeastern counties only: e.g., Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex.\nThe majority of such teams were simply labelled \"England\" and sometimes the term \"all-England\" was used loosely in a generic sense but, strictly speaking, the teams represented \"the Rest of England\". The \"all England\" term \"per se\" was first used in reports of two Kent v England matches in 1739. The first was at Bromley Common on Monday, 9 July, and billed as \"eleven gentlemen of that county (i.e., Kent) and eleven gentlemen from any part of England, exclusive of Kent\". Kent, described as \"the unconquerable county\", won by \"a very few notches\". The second match was at the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury on Monday, 23 July. This game was drawn and a report includes the phrase \"eleven picked out of all (\"sic\") England\". Top-level cricket at that time, however, was limited to the southeastern counties.\nBefore these matches, there were instances of teams representing a number of counties. On Thursday, 28 August 1729, a match between Edwin Stead's XI and Sir William Gage's XI was held at Penshurst Park, near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. The match had the alternative title of Kent (Stead) v Surrey, Sussex &amp; Hampshire (Gage). It was 11-a-side and played for 100 guineas with some thousands watching. It seems to have been the first known innings victory as Gage \"got (within three) in one hand, as the former did in two hands, so the Kentish men (i.e., Stead's team) threw it up\". A contemporary report states that \"(Thomas Waymark) turned the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side\". Given a 1728 reference to the superiority of Kent in the 1720s, it would seem that only a team representing three other counties had the strength to compete against them.\nGeneric usage.\nAfter 1739, \"England\" (or \"all-England\") became a generic term used to denote numerous teams over the next two hundred years. They invariably have important match status, depending on the quality and/or status of their opponents. Sometimes, the all-England teams were given names like \"The Rest\", which more accurately describes them \"vis-à-vis\" their opponents. \"CricketArchive\" (CA) lists 29 matches involving teams called England or The Rest between 1739 and 1778. These are all important matches but only one, England v Kent in 1744, has a scorecard. The earliest important match that has been designated \"first-class\" by CA (i.e., coded F1) was between a Hampshire county team and one called England on Broadhalfpenny Down at Hambledon in Hampshire on 24 June 1772. CA lists all matches involving teams called England without differentiating between international and non-international, so it seems they assume the \"England\" team of 1772 to be a direct predecessor of the modern England Test team. Not helpfully, CA also uses the term \"England XI\" and has another list, starting in 1872, of matches played by this team which is currently understood to be the England national team when playing non-international matches on tour. CA's list of England XI matches begins five years before Test cricket started and most of the early matches are between a university team and what is loosely termed an England XI.\nWilliam Clarke's All-England Eleven (the AEE).\nThe name \"All-England\" took on a specific meaning in 1846 when William Clarke's All-England Eleven, commonly known as the AEE, was founded as a touring team of leading players, its purpose being to take advantage of the new railway network and play matches at city venues, mainly in the North of England. Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy (cricketer), George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (\"aka\" \"Felix\") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from £4 to £6 per week) and so keep them interested. He kept the surplus for himself.\nThe AEE continued for several years to showcase the best players of the day. Subsequent additions to the squad included John Wisden of Sussex, William Dorrinton of Kent, Tom Sewell senior and his son Tom Sewell junior of Surrey. Because of its strength the AEE generally played \"odds\" matches against sides composed of twenty-two men, though these odds were reduced when opposed to such sides as Sheffield Cricket Club, Manchester Cricket Club and some county teams.\nThe AEE lasted until 1880. In all matches George Parr with 10,404 runs (av 16.78) was the leading batsman for the side and William Clarke himself took the most wickets (2,385).\nUnited All-England Eleven (UEE).\nIn 1852, several players set up the United All-England Eleven (UEE) as a rival to the AEE. Clarke would have nothing to do with the UEE but he died in 1856 and, from 1857 to 1866, matches were played between these two teams which were perhaps the most important contests of the English season – certainly judged by the quality of the players.\nThe AEE/UEE concept expanded with the formation of other itinerant elevens, notably the United North of England Eleven (UNEE) and the United South of England Eleven (USEE), the latter showcasing W. G. Grace.\nThe travelling elevens ran their course over a period of some thirty seasons but interest in them waned as county cricket grew and provided matches with a more competitive edge. With the advent of international cricket in the 1870s, especially following the hugely successful inaugural Australian tour in 1878, the travelling elevens faded away.\nNon-international England teams.\nTeams styled England and commonly referred to as all-England continued to play non-international matches into the 1880s but thereafter they tended to be given names such as The Rest because the England national team was by then well-established and understood to represent the country for the purpose of international cricket.\nThe earliest match involving a team styled \"The Rest of England\" took place at Bradford Park Avenue in June 1883 when the opposition was a composite Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire XI. The combined counties won by 6 wickets.\nIn the 20th century, Test trial matches were occasionally staged (the last in 1976) and these were called England v The Rest, but it is generally understood that the England of these games was the national side while The Rest formed the \"all-England\" element."

His primary position was at fullback.\nClub career.\nDavies joined Llanelli as a 19-year-old from Carmarthen Athletic. He has since made over 100 appearances for Llanelli and the Llanelli Scarlets. During his career at Stradey Park he became the region's top try scorer, racking up 37 tries in his lengthy stay at the region.\nIt came to light quite late in his Llanelli Scarlets career that Davies was quite a remarkable goal kicker. During and ever since the 2003 season, Davies would attempt kicks at goal from long distances. His greatest kick was against Ulster in the Celtic League at Ravenhill from an estimated distance of 59 metres. Though he did not perform these kicks often, it was this sort of play on the pitch that earned him the nickname 'Barry the boot' from one commentator during the EDF Energy and then again during the Powergen Cup semi-final against Bath.\nIn 2007, Davies joined French club CA Brive, and in June 2009, he joined the Ospreys. He was released by the Ospreys in July 2012. \nDavies joined Jersey Reds in 2012, spending one season with the Championship side. Following his departure from Jersey, Davies joined Coventry R.F.C. He signed on with the club for one more season, in 2014.\nNowadays, he is a director for nutrivend and has a wife, a child and a dog.\nInternational career.\nDavies was first included in the Welsh squad in 2004, for the Six Nations, following injuries to Garan Evans and Hal Luscombe. \nAfter scoring a memorable try for the Scarlets against Northampton Saints in the Heineken Cup pool stages, where the Scarlets needed to win the game to qualify for the quarter-finals, Davies was again called up, this time for the 2004 June rugby union tests. He was an unused bench replacement in a match against Argentina on 19 June.\nHe made his debut for Wales in early 2006, during the Six Nations that year. He came off the bench in a match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, which Wales lost 31–5."

        "text": "John Davies (born 1 February 1969) is a former Welsh rugby union prop. He spent much of his professional career playing for Llanelli RFC, and subsequently the Llanelli Scarlets regional side, where he now works as an academy coach. Davies also made 34 appearances for the Wales national team, scoring two tries.\nPlaying career.\nDavies made his international debut for Wales on 16 February 1991, in a match against Ireland during the Five Nations. The match, which was played in Cardiff, resulted in a 21–21 draw. He was capped again that year against France, and once the following season.\nHe was included in Wales' squad for the Five Nations of 1993, mostly as an unused bench replacement, but came on in the final game against France. He was also capped against Zimbabwe, in which Davies scored a try. He was also capped against Canada and Japan that year.\nHe was capped over 10 times for Wales in 1994, including all the matches in the Five Nations. The following season he played in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, though Wales did not make the quarter-finals, he played in all three pool matches. In 1996 he was capped nine times for Wales, including a match against the Barbarian F.C. He played matches against Zimbabwe and the Springboks in 1998.\nOn 18 February 1995, he became the first player in Five Nations rugby to receive a red card when French referee Didier Mené dismissed him for kicking Ben Clarke at Cardiff during a match against England.\nIn 2003, Davies was named as one of four senior props in the inaugural squad of the newly founded Llanelli Scarlets regional side. He missed just one game during the 2003–04 season, starting all but five, with Jon Thiel preferred for five of the last seven games. He also played in all but one of the Scarlets' games the following season, six of them off the bench, as Thiel was preferred for the first three matches of the season and Dave Hewett started the games against the Borders, the Ospreys and the Dragons in December and January.\nThe 2005–06 season saw the Scarlets struggle with injuries at the prop position; Davies was the only tighthead prop available following an injury to Ricky Davies in a pre-season friendly against Worcester Warriors. Despite being involved in a car crash in the week leading up to the opening game of the season, Davies played the full 80 minutes against Edinburgh Gunners. New Zealander Craig Dunlea was signed to alleviate the injury crisis in December 2005, but Davies still played in all but two matches between the start of the season and 21 January, including all three Anglo-Welsh Cup pool matches and all six Heineken Cup pool matches. After that, he started just five more matches, but two of those were the Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final and final.\nIn May 2006, Davies signed a one-year contract extension with the Scarlets, but at the age of 37, he started just six times during the season, with Dunlea and newly signed prop Deacon Manu preferred for the majority of games. On 6 April 2007, Davies became the second player to make 100 appearances for the Llanelli Scarlets – following Adam Jones, who had reached the milestone earlier in the season – when he started their 53–11 win at home to Border Reivers. Davies retired from professional rugby at the end of the season, playing his final game on the last day of the season in a 19–10 home win over Connacht.\nDavies made a brief return to first-team rugby when he played for Crymych RFC in September 2018 at the age of 49."

Celta de Vigo, Real Sociedad and Gimnàstic de Tarragona were relegated.\nBarcelona was in first place for much of the season while arch-rivals Real Madrid were six points behind and in fourth.

Throughout the match, Francisco played numerous shots which caused bafflement on the part of BBC commentators Clive Everton, John Virgo and Dennis Taylor. There were an unusual number of bets made that the scoreline would be 10–2 in favour of White, which was the eventual outcome. Betting had been suspended on the match against the South African shortly before it began and a World Snooker Association panel analysed the match and later banned Francisco for five years for \"not conducting himself in a manner consistent with his status as a professional sportsman\". At the same hearing he was not found guilty of match rigging. After the 5 years of his ban was up he did briefly resume his pro career in 2000 but failed to make any impact.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the nephew of fellow snooker players Manuel and Silvino Francisco."

        "text": "Dick Öland Klein (September 16, 1920 – October 10, 2000) was an American athlete and businessman who founded the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls in 1966. He served as the team's first general manager and later worked as a scout for the Phoenix Suns.\nBackground.\nHailing from Iowa, Klein played basketball at Northwestern University for Hall of Fame coach Dutch Lonborg. He then competed for the United States Navy's Great Lakes Blue Jackets, who traveled throughout the United States raising money for the Navy Relief Society.\nFrom 1945 to 1946, Klein played professionally for the National Basketball League's Chicago American Gears. He also dabbled in minor league baseball, spending one summer as a pitcher in the Cleveland Indians' farm system. Once his playing days were over, he moved to the Chicago suburbs and embarked on a highly successful career distributing promotional items to banks and other companies.\nFounding of the Chicago Bulls.\nThe late 1940s through early 1960s were a low point for professional basketball in Chicago. The American Gears suddenly folded in 1947 due to poor financial decisions by owner Maurice White. Three years later, the Chicago Stags of the early National Basketball Association disbanded due to lack of fan interest. The NBA returned to Chicago with the Chicago Packers in 1961, but their poor first season record (18–62) turned off many fans, and the team was sold to a group of Maryland investors in 1962.\nThe Chicago Packers were scheduled to relocate to Baltimore by the fall of 1963. In the meantime, the team adopted a new nickname, the Chicago Zephyrs. Hoping to keep the Zephyrs in Chicago, Dick Klein tried to purchase the team in 1963, but he failed, and the team left the city after posting a 25–55 second season record. However, Klein was determined to bring professional basketball back to Chicago, and started recruiting local businessmen to help him found an expansion team.\nMost investors were skeptical of Klein's venture, given the failure of the Zephyrs and their predecessors. A turning point occurred when Klein received the support of the American Broadcasting Company, who was negotiating with the NBA for television rights. ABC believed a successful Chicago team would help boost ratings, and once Klein had their backing, he was able to attract more partners. On January 26, 1966, his group was finally awarded an NBA expansion franchise at a cost of $1.6 million, and Klein was named general manager.\nKlein's first task was to coin a nickname for the new Chicago team. He wanted a name that evoked images of the Chicago stockyards, which were close to the stadium where the team was expected to play. According to Klein, he had originally considered Matadors or Toreadors, but when his youngest son dismissed these prospective nicknames as \"a bunch of bull,\" he decided to name the team the Chicago Bulls. He then recruited a neighbor to design the Bulls' familiar team logo. He chose the colors red and black from his former alma mater, Fort Madison High School, where he went to school and played basketball from 1934 to 1938.\nTeam management.\nKlein selected Johnny \"Red\" Kerr and Al Bianchi to serve as the Bulls' head coach and assistant coach, respectively. Since both were former players who were still under contract with their old teams, Klein actually drafted his coaching staff via the NBA Expansion Draft. He then acquired Guy Rodgers, Jerry Sloan, Len Chappell, Jim Washington, Erwin Mueller, Don Kojis, and Bob Boozer to form the core playing unit for the Bulls. In support of the new team, Klein and Kerr paraded through Chicago in a flatbed truck, accompanied by a live bull.\nThough the Bulls finished the 1966–67 NBA season with a 33–48 record, they still managed to reach the postseason. This was the first time any expansion franchise reached the playoffs in their first year, a feat that has not been repeated. They lost in the first round to the St. Louis Hawks in four games. Klein considered the season a success, saying, \"We had good players led by good men, so we became competitive\".\nHowever, the Bulls regressed the following season, winning just 29 games, and as the team struggled to increase attendance figures, tensions emerged between Klein and Kerr. Klein openly criticized Kerr in the local media, and he frequently sent notes to his coaching staff during games, which contained messages such as \"That's seven turnovers this quarter\". Tired of Klein's involvement, Kerr finally left the team in 1968 and was replaced by Dick Motta.\nUnfortunately, Klein feuded with Motta, as well. After Klein sent Erwin Mueller to the Seattle SuperSonics for cash in 1969, Motta reportedly said, \"You can't play with money; money won't play!\". Motta then ordered Klein to consult him before any trade he made in the future. Facing pressure from other members of team management, Klein stepped down as general manager before the start of the Bulls fourth season, but he retained his share of the ownership and saw the Bulls improve significantly under Motta during the next few seasons. The team won 51 games during the 1970–71 season and 57 games the next season, and the Bulls began to secure a steady fan base.\nAfter the Bulls.\nKlein orchestrated the sale of several owners' shares of the team (including his own) to a new ownership group that included Chicago Blackhawks owner Arthur Wirtz in the summer of 1972. \"In my opinion, with Wirtz at the steering wheel, the Bulls were in good hands,\" he later said. The Bulls eventually became one of the NBA's most profitable franchises, due in large part to the presence of Michael Jordan during the 1980s and 1990s (Wirtz, in turn, sold the Bulls to current owner Jerry Reinsdorf in 1984). Many of Klein's personnel selections blossomed into long-term NBA successes, including Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, and sports magnate Jerry Colangelo, who worked in Klein's front office in the Bull's early years. Klein's friendship with Colangelo and continued passion for the sport led him to serve as a Southeastern scout for the Phoenix Suns. He served in that capacity until shortly before his death in Greenville, South Carolina in 2000. The Bulls named him a member of the inaugural Ring of Honor in 2024."

He was the cricket correspondent for \"The Times\" from 1954 until 1987.\nEarly life.\nWoodcock was born in Longparish, Hampshire on 7 August 1926, the second son of the Reverend Parry Woodcock and his (much younger) wife Nora Dunsford (née Hutchinson). Since 1906 his father had been rector of Longparish, where the Woodcock family held the right of advowson. Woodcock was born in the rectory when his father was 70. His grandfather had been born in 1813, two years before the Battle of Waterloo.\nHis family relocated from Longparish after his father retired in 1933. Woodcock completed his primary education at the Dragon School. As a child, he was a good angler before moving onto cricket while attending St Edward's School, Oxford. When he was fifteen, he almost died from septic arthritis. His hip was permanently injured as a result, and he was strapped to a frame for four months.\nWoodcock read Geography at Trinity College, Oxford. Despite his aforementioned injury, he won hockey blues in 1946 and 1947. He also reached the final trial of the university cricket team and played for the Authentics (Oxford's second XI). After graduating with fourth class honours (which he attributed to his being \"very lazy\"), he obtained a diploma in education, intending to become a teacher. However, E. W. Swanton managed to secure a job for him of scoring for the BBC at the Second Test at Lord's in 1948.\nCareer.\nWoodcock went on the England tour of Australia in 1950–51 as a newsreel cameraman for the BBC and assistant to Swanton. He also wrote for \"The Manchester Guardian\" during the 1952 Tests against India, filling in for Denys Rowbotham. Upon Rowbotham's return, Woodcock became the paper's London sports editor. He became the cricket correspondent for \"The Times\" in 1954. He began his first stint as \"The Times\" correspondent during the England tour of Australia in 1954–55.\nWoodcock was dubbed \"the Sage of Longparish\" by Alan Gibson, his colleague at \"The Times\". He served as its cricket correspondent until 1987, attending more than 400 Tests in the process. He also edited the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" for six editions from 1981 until 1986, and was credited for improving its reputation and standard. He also wrote for \"The Cricketer\" and \"Country Life\", as well as covering some golf for \"The Times\". He was a contributor to the \"Longparish Village Handbook\". He did not support the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, but later acknowledged that his position had been wrong.\nWoodcock was president of the Cricket Writers' Club from 1986 to 2004, having been chairman in 1966. He was awarded an OBE in 1996 for services to sports journalism. In retirement, he was an MCC committee member.\nUnlike other notable cricket journalists such as John Arlott and E. W. Swanton, little of Woodcock's writing is available in book form. He did, however, write \"The Times One Hundred Greatest Cricketers\" (Macmillan, 1998, ). He was Associate Editor of the encyclopaedia \"Barclay's World of Cricket\", of which Swanton was the General Editor (1980 (2nd edition), Collins Publishers, ). He chose not to write an autobiography, partly through his modesty but also because he did not wish to risk harming anyone's reputation or the game itself.\nAt the 2018 Sports Book Awards evening, Woodcock received a special award for Outstanding Contribution to Sports Writing. Henry Blofeld said at the event, \"John Woodcock is the most thorough watcher of a day’s cricket I've ever known.\"\nWoodcock contributed his final piece for \"The Times\" in July 2020 as a tribute to the veteran West Indian cricketer Sir Everton Weekes.\nAfter his death he received many tributes from his fellow cricket writers. Mike Selvey wrote that he was \"the finest of all cricket writers\". According to Derek Pringle, \"John Woodcock was the kind of scribe we’d all like to be – elegant, informative and generous with a beautiful turn of phrase.\" Simon Wilde said, \"Some other cricket correspondents of his generation were more celebrated but he was the best.” According to Matthew Engel, \"throughout his long retirement, pilgrims would descend on the thatched Hampshire cottage where Woodcock had lived more for than 70 years to imbibe his wisdom, wine, anecdotes, fellowship, good nature and what became an unparalleled memory of cricket dating back to Donald Bradman and beyond\".\nPersonal life.\nWoodcock was a lifelong bachelor and had no children. He returned to the village of his birth, Longparish, in 1947. In retirement there, he would have lunch at the village pub, presided over the cricket club and \"was patron of the church, where a stained-glass window called 'The Four Seasons' celebrates his family's 250-year connection with the church and village\".\nWoodcock died on the afternoon of 18 July 2021, at the Old Curacy of Longparish. He was 94 years old."

        "text": "The South Africa national cricket team toured Sri Lanka for cricket matches in the 2006 cricket season. South Africa are scheduled to play two Test matches against Sri Lanka, one warm-up first class game over three days against Sri Lanka A, and at least four One Day Internationals as part of a triangular series. Sri Lanka took the Test series 2–0 after winning the final Test by one wicket, their second successive home Test series win against South Africa after their win in 2004.\nTest series.\n2nd Test.\nSri Lanka took the final Test by one wicket, in a match \"neither side deserved to lose\". South Africa opted to bat first, lost openers Gibbs and Hall for ducks, but captain Ashwell Prince shared a fifth-wicket stand of 141 with de Villiers, and Shaun Pollock also made an unbeaten half-century with the tail before Makhaya Ntini was caught on the final ball of the first day to close on 361.\nNtini then took four top-order wickets in the morning session, his final wicket being that of Sanath Jayasuriya three short of a half-century, and Sri Lanka were 86 for five, needing 275 for the final five wickets to restore parity. However, the sixth wicket stand between Chamara Kapugedera and Prasanna Jayawardene yielded 105 runs before both were bowled in successive over, and Farveez Maharoof and Chaminda Vaas then batted out 37 overs to add 117. Steyn then rounded off the tail, claiming his first Test five-for in 13.1 overs, and Sri Lanka were bowled out 40 short.\nOn the third day, Gibbs made a four-hour 92, as Muralitharan and Kapugedera stood for most of the wickets; Kapugedera had Jacques Rudolph and Hashim Amla run out, while Muralitharan got credited with seven wickets while bowling. The final wicket was that of Andrew Hall, the first of the innings, who was caught behind off Farveez Maharoof with the score on 76. Mark Boucher hit 65 with the tail before he was last out, setting Sri Lanka 352 to win in five sessions.\nSouth Africa got an immediate breakthrough, with opener Upul Tharanga caught off Ntini for 0 in the third over. However, that was to be Ntini's only wicket; in his eighth over, he limped off with a hamstring injury, never to return. South Africa were left with four main bowlers, and as Steyn could not find his first innings effectiveness, and Mahela Jayawardene stood up with a six-hour 123, Sri Lanka managed the chase. At lunch on day five, they needed 19 with four wickets in hand, but Jayawardene was caught by Gibbs in the eighth over after lunch, with 11 still needed. Andrew Hall then claimed the wickets of Vaas and Muralitharan in the same over, but also conceded two runs. Maharoof hit Boje for a single, and Lasith Malinga could hit the winning run on the only ball he faced in the innings.\nWithdrawal from Unitech Cup.\nOriginally, South Africa was set to play Sri Lanka and India in the tri-nation Unitech Cup one-day cricket tournament. Following a series of bomb blasts in the Sri Lankan capital, relating to the renewal of terrorist activity plaguing that country, Cricket South Africa employed an independent security consultant to determine the risk posed to players. The risk to the team was determined to be \"unacceptable\" and South Africa's involvement in the tour came to a premature end. Following South Africa's withdrawal, Sri Lanka and India were scheduled to play a One-day International series, but this was rained off."

        "text": "Thomas William Bradley (born March 16, 1947) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through for the California Angels, Chicago White Sox and San Francisco Giants.\nCareer.\nBradley was drafted out of the University of Maryland by the California Angels on June 7, 1968, in the 7th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. He made his Major League debut at the age of 22 with the Angels on Sept. 9, 1969. It was not an auspicious one, Bradley being roughed up in a seven-run inning by the Minnesota Twins and taking the loss in an 11–7 defeat. He entered the game in the sixth inning and gave up a leadoff single to César Tovar and a two-run homer by Leo Cárdenas. With two more men on base after Rod Carew reached on an error, Tony Oliva hit a two-run double and Bradley was lifted from the game.\nBradley was traded along with Jay Johnstone and Tom Egan from the Angels to the Chicago White Sox for Ken Berry, Syd O'Brien and Billy Wynne on November 30, 1970. He promptly became one of the team's most reliable starting pitchers. Bradley's 1971 season included a 15–15 record and six shutouts, his 39 starts being the third-highest total in the American League that season. Tommy John thought Bradley would have had an even better year had pitching coach Johnny Sain not insisted he throw a slider. \"Bradley began the 1971 season on fire. He was awesome for the first eight weeks, relying on his fastball and curveball. But after Sain got him to go to the slider more and more, he lost his fastball. He might have won 22 or 23 games that year, but finished at 15–15.\"\nOne of his most impressive starts came early in the season, when Bradley threw a four-hit shutout against the Oakland A's on April 17, 1971, at Comiskey Park, striking out 10, including Reggie Jackson three times.\nAfter another 15-win season a year later, he was traded by the White Sox to the San Francisco Giants, a team that was in need of serious pitching help, for Ken Henderson and Steve Stone on November 29, 1972. Bradley had a 13–12 record in 1973, but finished his MLB career with the Giants two years later in 1975. He played in his final major league game on September 15, 1975, at the age of 28.\nCoaching.\nBradley served as the head baseball coach at his alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park, from 1991 to 2000. As coach, his Maryland Terrapins achieved a record of 243–306–5 (.439). His Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) record stands at 57–173 (.248). He had more success coaching at Jacksonville University, where he coached the Dolphins. From 1979 to 1990, he compiled a 432–291–5 (.597) record.\nIn 2001, Bradley managed the Medicine Hat Blue Jays in the Pioneer League. He served as a pitching coach for the Midwest League's Lansing Lugnuts, a Blue Jays affiliate, in 2005. He remained in the Midwest League for the 2006 season, joining the San Diego Padres' affiliate, the Fort Wayne Wizards, as their pitching coach. Bradley spent the 2007 season as the pitching coach for the Padres's short-season Northwest League affiliate, the Eugene Emeralds. He returned to the Wizards in the same capacity in 2008."

An Australian international and Queensland State of Origin representative forward, he played his club football in the Brisbane Rugby League for the Souths Logan Magpies under the coaching of Wayne Bennett. He also played in the NSWRL for Eastern Suburbs and Manly-Warringah.\nBackground.\nBrown was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nCareer.\nClub career.\nDave Brown started his club career in the Brisbane Rugby League competition with the Souths Magpies.\nIn 1981, Brown signed with Sydney club Eastern Suburbs. Under the coaching of Bob Fulton, Brown played 41 games for the Roosters in 1981 and 1982 (and was considered unlucky not to be selected for the 1982 Kangaroo tour), before following Fulton to Manly in 1983 where he would win the 1983 Dally M of the year award, though injury kept him out of the Sea Eagles Grand Final team that lost 18–6 to Parramatta. Brown stayed at Manly for the 1984 season, before once again joining Easts for what would be his last two years of top grade football in Australia.\nAfter finishing his career with Easts at the end of the 1986 NSWRL season (after having only played 12 games over the course of 1985 and 1986), Brown ventured to England where he joined Hull F.C. in the 1986–87 season.

Hull finished the season in 11th place and only two places away from being relegated to the Second Division. Following the season, Brown returned home to Brisbane.\nAfter returning to Australia, Brown played in the Western Australian Rugby League in Perth as Captain-coach of the Belmont Steelers in 1988–90.\nRepresentative career.\nDave Brown made his first representative appearance when he was selected Queensland in a 30–5 loss to New South wales in 1979. Later that year he was chosen for the Brisbane Firsts team that played in an Amco Cup game at Sydney's Leichhardt Oval in 1979 against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, a game Cronulla won 22–5. Brown's teammates at Leichhardt that night included pairing Mal Meninga and Chris Close, Ross Strudwick, Test John Lang, while on the interchange bench was a young forward named Wally Lewis.\nBrown played two State of Residence and ten State of Origin matches for Queensland between 1979 and 1986, scoring his only try for the Maroons in Game 3 of the 1983 State of Origin series at Lang Park after coming on as a replacement for Darryl Brohman who had his jaw broken after a sickening elbow from New South Wales' forward Les Boyd, a Manly teammate of Brown. Brohman had been widely tipped to make his test debut for Australia in the first Trans-Tasman Test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland just three days later, but ironically the spot in the test team went to Brown instead. He played his last game for Queensland in Game 1 of the 1986 State of Origin series at Lang Park, but was dropped after NSW defeated Qld 22–16 in front of 33,066 fans.\nHis standout performances for Queensland in 1983 saw him make the first of 5 test appearances for Australia in the opening test of the 1983 Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand, and would retain his spot for the second game at Lang Park. He then went on to play in the front row in the first two games of The Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, before being relegated to the bench for what would be his final test as Australia defeated Great Britain 20–7 in the final test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia retained The Ashes with a 3–0 series win over the Lions."

        "title": "Bull Allen (rugby union)",
        "text": "Mark Richard Allen (born 27 July 1967), commonly known as Bull Allen, is a New Zealand former rugby union footballer and TV celebrity, reaching iconic status on the New Zealand sports scene in the 1990s. As well as 19 games and 8 test match appearances for New Zealand, Allen played 110 games for Taranaki and was captain of the inaugural Wellington Hurricanes Super 12 team. He was also captain of the first and short-lived Central Vikings team.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nMark Allen was born in Stratford, New Zealand, on 31 July 1967, to Steve Allen and Annette Richards. His father Steve ran an auto-electrical store which had been established by Steve's father Colin in 1945. Allen attended Stratford Primary School and received his secondary education at Stratford High School. He stood out in both wrestling and in rugby, representing the First XV in the latter.\nTaranaki years.\nUpon leaving school Allen took up an apprenticeship with his father, and quickly stood out for Stratford in age-grade and club rugby as an exceptionally mobile prop forward. He played his first match for Taranaki in the annual Queens Birthday Weekend fixture in 1988 against Wanganui. Later that season he was selected for the Rugby News New Zealand Youth Team which toured Germany and Scotland and was coached by Fred Allen and Sid Going. It was on this tour that Allen picked up the nickname \"Bull\", coined by Going's nephew Quentin in reference to a character in the American TV Series Night Court then showing on New Zealand television. It was a nickname that was to stick for the remainder of his career and beyond.\nIn 1989 Allen secured a permanent place in the Taranaki front row, and in 1990 was awarded Taranaki player of the year after impressing with his strong scrummaging and hard running. He toured Canada with the New Zealand Development Team at the end of the year and just missed out on All Black selection when the All Black front row in France was plagued with injury, losing out to Olo Brown because he could not play tighthead prop.\nIn 1991 Allen struggled with Asthma and the flu, and the Taranaki side was relegated to second division after finishing at the bottom of the table. In 1992 the team fought hard in a competitive second division and came out on top, returning to the first division the following year. Taranaki's success had a lot to do with the form and leadership of \"Bull\", who was appointed captain for the final four games. He scored two tries in his first match as captain, and two in the semi-final win against Manawatu, finishing the season with 10 tries and a reputation as the most mobile and dynamic prop forward in the country.\nSelection for the All Blacks.\n1993 saw Allen selected for the All Blacks for the first time, making his first appearance in the test match against Samoa at Eden Park. He toured England and Scotland with the side at the end of the year, playing seven more games in the black jersey. The following year Richard Loe returned from suspension, and coach Laurie Mains controversially preferred Loe over Allen on the grounds Allen was too flashy and not strong enough as a scrummager. To add injury to insult Allen suffered a unique blow when he ripped his pectoral muscle almost completely in a match against Auckland and missed the rest of the season, which saw Taranaki again relegated to the second division.\nAllen recovered in time to attend All Black training camps over the summer in preparation for the World Cup, although made the headlines after nearly drowning in a whitewater rafting accident. He trialled for the World Cup team, but was again rejected with 35-year-old Loe chosen ahead of him. Again, though, Allen led the Taranaki side to victory in the second division and a return to division one. His leadership proved crucial in the semi-final against Bay of Plenty when prop Gordon Slater appeared to have been the victim of foul play and was carried off with a broken leg, and that year was awarded the Hilary Commission Fair Play award. The \"Bull Fan Club\" was appeased when Allen was selected for the All Black tour of Italy and France where he played four games and scored a try against Cote Basque-Landes.\nWellington Hurricanes &amp; Central Vikings.\nIn 1996 Rugby Football became professional in New Zealand with the formation of the Super 12 involving teams from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Allen was appointed captain of the Wellington Hurricanes team, and led them in New Zealand's first ever professional rugby football match. He made a test match appearance as a substitute against Scotland that season, and toured South Africa with the first All Black team to win a test match series against South Africa on their turf. The same weekend that the series was sealed, while Allen was in South Africa, Taranaki won the prestigious Ranfurly Shield in a victory over Auckland. However Allen's perceived lack of enthusiasm when put on the spot in an impromptu interview led to some bad feeling among some Taranaki supporters, and upon returning Allen did not resume the captaincy from Andy Slater. The end-of-year 80–34 defeat at the hands of Otago proved to be Allen's final appearance in the amber and black jersey after 110 games for the province.\nThe following year \"Bull\" joined the newly created Central Vikings team, which was a merger of the Manawatu and Hawkes Bay unions under Hurricanes coach Frank Oliver, in an attempt to form a more competitive team that could foot it in first division. Allen was named captain, but could not add a third second division victory to the two he'd won for Taranaki. He made four test match appearances in the New Zealand season as substitute against Argentina, South Africa and Australia, scoring his only test match try against Argentina. Selected for his second All Black tour of the UK, Allen made an appearance as substitute against Wales, and was selected for the starting line-up for the final match against England. This is commonly considered to have been the peak of Allen's rugby career. In 1998 Allen was devastated by a serious back injury when he was diagnosed with a prolapsed disc in his back. At the same time Allen recognised the priority of family life and decided to retire altogether from the game after playing 19 games and 8 test matches for the All Blacks and scoring two tries.\nTV appearances.\nAllen was a well-known face on New Zealand TV with his shaved head, grin and personality. He hosted TV shows such as \"Ansett New Zealand Time of Your Life\", \"The Footy Show\" and \"Game of Two-Halves\".\nIn 2020, he made his one-game return as part of the reinforcement squad for \"Match Fit Squad\" for old boys All Blacks vs. Barbarians."

He retired from playing at the end of 2006's Super League XI following two seasons with /. He is an Ireland international.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born in Hornsby, New South Wales, Australia.\nWilliams played junior rugby league with the Woy Woy Roosters, a highlight during that time was playing under 12's, and remaining undefeated the whole season and winning the premiership. He was educated at Umina High School, where he represented 1991 Australian Schoolboys.\nPlaying career.\nNorth Sydney.\nWilliams made his first grade debut with North Sydney Bears in 1993. He made a total of 66 appearances for the club including the 1996 preliminary final defeat against St George, scoring 3 tries and 1 goal. While with the Bears, Williams was part of back-to-back reserve grade premierships in 1992-93.\nMelbourne.\nAfter his spell at Norths, Williams joined the newly formed Melbourne Storm in 1998. The following season Williams came off the bench in the Storm's 20-18 1999 NRL Grand Final victory over the St George Illawarra Dragons. Having won the 1999 Premiership, the Melbourne Storm traveled to England to contest the 2000 World Club Challenge against Super League Champions St Helens, with Williams playing from the interchange bench in the victory.\nAt the end of the 2000 NRL season, Williams represented Ireland at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, by virtue of his grandfather's Irish heritage.\nOn 17 July 2004, during round 19 of the 2004 NRL season, Danny Williams coward-punched Wests Tigers' player Mark O'Neill. Williams defended the incident, using four medical experts to argue on his behalf that he was suffering post traumatic amnesia when the incident occurred, which he claims was the result of a high tackle by O'Neill just prior to the incident. Despite Williams' claim he was suspended for eighteen weeks by the NRL Judiciary. Even if Williams decided to head overseas the ban would still apply. After the decision was made Williams stated that he was \"obviously disappointed with the outcome\". It was the longest suspension in Australian rugby league since Steve Linnane was suspended for twenty weeks for eye-gouging in 1987. In total he made 146 appearances for the club but was released after his ban, and signed for English club of Super League.\nHarlequins.\nAfter signing for the Harlequins, Williams missed the opening rounds of the 2005 season following the suspension given to him by the NRL Judiciary. He made his début for the club over the Easter period in 2005, and retired from playing at the end of the following year.\nPersonal life.\nOn 2 November 2022, Williams avoided jail after being previously charged for glassing a woman at a Sydney pub. William had originally pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm during the incident on 1 October 2022. It was alleged that Williams had thrown a glass back at the woman before smashing a glass on the back of her head, leaving her with a cut, although she didn't go to hospital. Williams then allegedly fled the bar but was later found and arrested. Williams was handed a $1000 fine and an 18-month correction order."

However he made a comeback towards the end of the season after initially being ruled out for the entire campaign\n2005 was a record breaking year for Sykes. On 27 February against the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, Sykes kicked 12 goals from 12 attempts to break a 17-year-old London club record.\nFurther records for most goals and most points followed at the season's end and in recognition of these achievements Sykes was voted Supporters' Player-of-the-Year for 2005.\nHarlequins centre Sykes has confirmed his expected move to Bradford for next season on a two-year contract.\nSykes, who made his Great Britain début earlier this season, left Bradford on loan in 2002 to find first-team rugby.\nQuins coach Brian McDermott also paid tribute to Sykes' contribution at the Stoop.\nBradford and the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.\nSykes signed for Bradford Bulls in September 2007 as a replacement for the departing Ben Harris.\nOn rejoining Bradford he said: \"A lot's changed at Bradford since the first time around and I think there's only Paul Deacon and Jamie Langley still there. \"But I'm ready for a fresh challenge and I'm hoping to move back north to win some silverware.

        "text": "The 1924 Tour de France was the 18th edition of the Tour de France and was won by Ottavio Bottecchia. He was the first Italian cyclist to win the Tour and the first rider to hold the yellow jersey the entire event. The race was held over 5,425 km with an average speed of 23.972 km/h (14.896 mph). 60 riders finished the race from the original 157 cyclists.\nEntrants of the 1924 Tour included several past and future winners including defending champion Henri Pélissier (1923), Philippe Thys (1913, 1914, 1920), Lucien Buysse (1926) and Nicolas Frantz (1927, 1928).\nThe event saw the increase of the time bonus for stage wins move from 2 minutes to 3 minutes. In addition, it was the final year of the 15-stage format that had started in 1910. One of the most important events of the race occurred on the third stage, when defending champion Pélissier quit the race because of a new fight with tour organiser Henri Desgrange.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1923, a time bonus of two minutes for each stage winner had been introduced. This was considered successful, and the time bonus was increased to three minutes for the 1924 Tour de France.\nAfter the 1923 Tour de France, the winner Henri Pélissier had said that the runner-up Bottecchia would go on to win the race.\nRace overview.\nIn 1924, there was a rule that the cyclists had to finish with everything they started with, and the officials suspected that Pélissier would start in the cold morning with many jerseys, and remove them once the day warmed up. The rule had been introduced in 1920, when all the cyclists were sponsored by the combined sponsor La Sportive, to prevent waste of material. Pélissier objected to the rule, on the ground that the jerseys that he wore were his own, and had not been provided by the sponsor.\nAt the start of the third stage, a tour official checked how many jerseys Henri Pélissier was wearing. Pélissier was angry, and declared that he would not start the race. He did so anyway, but retired at Coutances, together with his brother Francis Pélissier and teammate Maurice Ville. The three cyclists met journalist Albert Londres of Petit Parisien, to whom they complained about the circumstances in which the cyclists had to race.\nIn that third stage, that ended on a circuit, Theophile Beeckman crossed the finish line first. However, the bell indicating the last lap was not rung, and Philippe Thys was placed ex aequo on the first place by the officials.\nIn the first five stages, the cyclists finished in groups, and the time bonus of three minutes for the winner was the only thing that separated the cyclists. After the third and fourth stage, Bottecchia had the same time as Beeckman, although Bottecchia was still given the yellow jersey as classification leader. In the sixth and seventh stage, Bottecchia extended his lead in the Pyrenees. After these stages, he had a margin of 50 minutes over second-placed Nicolas Frantz.\nIn the Alps, Bottecchia was not so dominant anymore. In stages 10 to 13, Frantz won back a few minutes per stage, but it was not enough.\nIn the thirteenth stage, Bottecchia ran into a dog and fell. Nicolas Frantz tried to win back time, but failed.\nIn the penultimate stage, Italian Giovanni Brunero was in third place in the overall classification, when he had to give up. Prior to the last stage, the margin between Bottecchia and Frantz was still 32 minutes. Bottecchia won the final stage to Paris, and the time bonus of 3 minutes made the margin 35 minutes.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time (after compensating for time bonuses and/or time penalties) was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nBottecchia became the first Italian cyclist who won the Tour de France, and the first cyclist to wear the yellow jersey from the start to the end of the Tour de France.\nAftermath.\nA few days after Henri Pélissier quit the race, he sent a letter to the communist magazine l'Humanité, writing that he accepted \"‘excessive fatigue, suffering, pain\" as part of the cycling profession, but that he wanted to be treated as a human being. Tour organiser Desgrange still kept to his formula of trying to get the cyclists to ride individually until 1930, when he accepted that cyclists would run in teams and introduced nationalized teams.\nThe number of stages increased in the next years. For example, in 1925 the cyclists went from Brest to Bayonne in two stages, racing in total; in 1926 this was done in four stages, racing . With these shorter stages, the cyclists did not have to start in the middle of the night.\nBottecchia would win the Tour de France again in 1925. The runner-up, Nicolas Frantz, would win in 1927 and 1928; in 1928 he would repeat the feat of Bottecchia of wearing the yellow jersey the entire race."

        "text": "The Golf Specialist is a 1930 pre-Code comedy short subject from RKO Pictures, starring W. C. Fields. It was his first talkie. The film was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey when many early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based there in the early part of the 20th century.\nThe film features lines such as \"I would never hit a woman, not even my own mother\" and \"Stand clear and keep your eye on the ball\", a line Fields also used in the golf scene in \"The Dentist\" (1932). Fields had first performed his golf routine on film in his silent feature \"So's Your Old Man\" (1926) and reprised it in that film's sound remake, \"You're Telling Me!\" (1934).\nPlot.\nIn a Florida hotel, the House Detective's wife likes to flirt with other men. The House Detective catches her flirting with a man, and he bodily throws him out.\nDeep Sea McGurk comes in and asks the Desk Clerk for J. Effingham Bellweather, but he is not in. McGurk dictates a note for the Desk Clerk to give to Bellweather that he wants to collect the money that is owed to him.\nBellweather enters, and the Desk Clerk gives him the note from McGurk, which he tears up. After brief encounters with a bratty little girl and the House Detective, Bellweather offers to teach the Detective's Wife how to play golf.\nThe two of them and their Caddy go out to the golf course, but Bellweather never gets to hit the ball. He is continuously interrupted by such distractions as the incompetent Caddy's squeaking shoes, the wind blowing papers into his path, and accidentally stepping into a pie that the Caddy had brought.\nFinally, the Sheriff and the House Detective come out to the course to arrest con artist Bellweather for a list of absurd crimes (including \"eating spaghetti in public\", \"jumping board bill in seventeen lunatic asylums\", \"failure to pay installments on a strait-jacket\", and \"possessing a skunk\"); the police put handcuffs on him just as he's showing the Detective's Wife the importance of keeping the wrists close together while gripping the club."

        "title": "All American Football League",
        "text": "The All American Football League (AAFL) was a proposed professional American football minor league. The league, which was to combine a professional pay structure with the requirement that all players be college graduates, had originally been scheduled to start in the spring of 2007, but later postponed its launch to the spring of 2008, only to cancel its 2008 season a month before kickoff and suspend its launch until the next year. The league again postponed their launch each successive year, with the final postponement taking place in February 2010; despite that postponement it was stated that the league's first game would take place in spring 2011. As of spring 2011 there were no further actions from the league.\nLeague formation and structure.\nThe All American Football League was to be a professional american football league premised on the rule that all of its players had to have a four-year university degree, as employees of the AAFL rather than of the franchises, with the league to pay each player an average compensation of approximately $100,000 to year-round player employees and $50,000 to season-only players to attract the best non-NFL players. Also that the former college players would play in college stadiums. The AAFL's inaugural draft took place on January 26, 2008, though it was effectively voided when the league canceled that season.\nTeams.\nFor its proposed 2008 season, the AAFL established six franchises, all but one of which were located in the Southern United States (Team Michigan being the lone exception). One of the more unusual features of the league was that the teams had no nicknames, being referred to as \"Team Florida\", \"Team Texas\", etc. The teams, which had hired coaches, drafted players, and contracted with stadiums to host games for 2008 were:\nNone of these teams actually played a single game before the league announced it was relaunching.\nThe league was unveiled at a press conference in New York City on July 26, 2006, with Cedric Dempsey, former president of the NCAA, as its chairman. Before that, Dempsey was the longtime athletic director at the University of Arizona. The rest of the league's Board of Directors included various well-known sports and private industry individuals.\nThe league signed agreements from a specific, manageable target list of football tradition-rich universities and prominent stadiums which would host games during the spring months. Each team drafted and/or signed players that graduated from the host state's universities. The AAFL draft took place on January 26 and 27, 2008. An AAFL release stated that a player \"must, without exception, have earned a four-year degree or more advanced degree to be eligible to play in League games.\" The release added that other players would be invited to try out \"in the hopes that the opportunity will inspire them to complete their education\".\nWith the demise of NFL Europa, the AAFL would have had to have competed with the Arena Football League and the then-af2 for talent among spring football leagues. According to the Associated Press report of the league's formation, Dempsey had stated that AAFL players would earn about $100,000 a season, as compared to the $30,000 minimum then paid by the Arena Football League. Moreover, the league, rather than the franchise owners, would pay the players and coaches in order to control spending. Later, however, the league announced that \"During its initial season, most players will be paid $5,000 per game plus benefits, slightly higher than the salaries of the now defunct XFL. Six players on each team will be designated as franchise players, who will be eligible for an additional $50,000 per year.\"\nThe league announced a 10-game season for 2008, from April 12 to June 14, with all six teams to have played in one division during the first season. The teams with the second and third best records in the regular season were to meet in a playoff for the right to face the number one team in a championship game to be played on July 3, 2008. The AAFL released its schedule in October, 2007, with the April 12, 2008 games consisting of Alabama at Florida (at Jacksonville), Arkansas at Texas, and Michigan at Tennessee. The AAFL held its kickoff tryouts on July 2–3, 2007, in Orlando, Florida. On July 26, tryouts were held in Birmingham, Alabama; more followed in Little Rock, Arkansas (August 18); Detroit, Michigan (September 13); Tampa, Florida on October 12; Houston, Texas on October 24 and 25; and Knoxville, Tennessee (December 6 and 7).\nThe AAFL had announced partnerships with New Balance, official supplier of on-field AAFL team apparel; Schutt Sports, official supplier of helmets and protective equipment; Baden, official supplier of AAFL footballs; Rogers Athletic Company, official supplier of football equipment; and the NFL Officiating Department, which will provide officiating support.\nPostponement of inaugural season.\nOn March 13, 2008, the league announced that the 2008 season would not take place and expressed hope that the league might play in 2009. The AAFL website issued a statement that \"The All American Football League (AAFL) announced today the postponement of its inaugural season until 2009. The League will continue to build upon the foundation that has been established, and will continue to discuss opportunities with potential investors. AAFL sponsors have committed to remain on board for the 2009 season. Currently, the League has corporate partnerships with New Balance, Baden Sports and Rogers Athletic. Also still in place for the 2009 season are a national radio partnership with Touchdown Radio &amp; SportsDay Productions, and an internet broadcast partnership with PlayOn! Sports, a division of Turner Broadcasting.\" Keenan Davis, vice-president of league operations and Chief Operating Officer said that \"We are so very fortunate to have built partnerships with companies who are partners in the truest sense of the word. We sincerely appreciate their support as we progress toward our new goal of a 2009 inaugural season.\" The league press release added that \"All fans who have purchased tickets to 2008 AAFL games will receive a full refund. Credit cards will be credited and any checks received will be returned.\"\nThe \"Houston Business Journal\" reported that Team Texas had sold only 250 season tickets, and that team president Mike Pede had announced that the ten employees of Team Texas would be laid off and would \"receive severance depending on their length of time with the organization\".\nIn 2008, The league had announced it was considering a postponement of its season, stating that \"Since inception, the League's finances have been indirectly tied to the $300 billion federally guaranteed student loan asset backed securities market. In August, the sub prime mortgage crisis began spreading into other sectors such as municipal bonds and federally guaranteed student loans. The situation, which was considered to be temporary at the time, has continued to worsen. Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has repeatedly lowered interest rates during this financial crisis, their efforts have not yet restored liquidity in many asset backed markets, including municipal bonds and student loans.\"\nAll players signed to AAFL teams were immediately released and were free to sign elsewhere.\nCessation of operations.\nThe league remained largely silent since the March 2008 announcement. The only action known to have been taken by the league was a March 2009 announcement on the league Web site (the previous version of which was taken down at that time) stating that the league was aiming for a spring 2010 launch, with new host markets. In February 2010, after another prolonged silence from the league, the league's Webmaster changed the number 2010 to 2011 but left everything else unchanged. There were no updates on the situation afterwards, and the spring 2011 mark remained on the AAFL Web site into 2012, with no other actions or updates—by March 2013.\nTelevision and radio.\nThe AAFL draft was broadcast live on the league's website, and on several stations.\nA national radio contract with Sirius Satellite Radio was announced. The league president confirmed a deal with Sirius Satellite Radio and even talked talks about possible TV deals, along with a radio broadcast deal for all games produced by Touchdown Radio Productions (a college football syndication service) and distribution through the American Forces Network and Sports Byline USA. Even after the cancellation of the 2008 season, the league still said they had reached an agreement in principle with NFL Network to carry games once play commenced.\nBoard of directors.\nA diverse group of leaders from within intercollegiate athletics was to have served as the board of directors:\nAAFL Draft.\nThe AAFL Draft took place in Atlanta on Saturday, January 26, 2008. The first player selected overall was Zarah Yisrael, offensive lineman from Troy University, who was picked by Team Arkansas. The 2001 Heisman Trophy award winner Eric Crouch was selected with the third pick by Team Texas.\nUnder the draft rules, each team was permitted to designate a number of \"protected\" players from schools within their area. Thus, Team Florida listed, as protected, former Gators' quarterback Chris Leak, as well as players from Florida colleges. Team Texas could put players from Texas schools on its list. The downside to listing a large number of players as \"protected\" was that they forfeited a few picks early in the draft. Each team had a total of 50 picks; the protected players counted against this number, and were counted as having been selected in the middle rounds."

        "text": "John Murdoch Garrett (born June 17, 1951) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and television sports commentator. He played in the World Hockey Association from 1973 to 1979 and then in the National Hockey League from 1979 to 1985. After retiring from playing he turned to broadcasting.\nBiography.\nGarrett was born in Trenton, Ontario.\nPlaying career.\nOriginally selected in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft by the St. Louis Blues, Garrett played one year for the Blues' Central Hockey League affiliate before joining the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League for half a season and then moving on to the Richmond Robins of the American Hockey League. He signed with the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association in 1973-74. He would play with the Fighting Saints until the franchise folded on 25 February 1976. He then signed with the Toronto Toros, and would follow the Toros franchise when it relocated to Birmingham. In the final WHA season, Garrett was traded to the New England Whalers, and would remain with the franchise when it entered the NHL. He holds the record for the most losses by any goalie in WHA history. Garrett would also play for the Quebec Nordiques and Vancouver Canucks of the NHL before retiring at the start of the 85-86 season.\nGarrett was involved in one of the oddest scenarios in the history of the NHL All-Star Game. Replacing an injured Richard Brodeur, the Vancouver Canucks' only representative at the 1983 All-Star game that year, John Garrett was voted the game's MVP before the end of the game. After Wayne Gretzky scored four times in the last ten minutes, a re-vote was held and Gretzky was named the All-Star Game MVP.\nBroadcasting career.\nGarrett retired before the 1985–86 season. He had been offered the position of assistant general manager by Canucks' GM Harry Neale, but Neale was fired and the offer subsequently withdrawn. Garrett then began his broadcasting career in 1986-87. He worked as a colour commentator on CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada\". Within a few years, he was considered a valuable member of the team and was assigned his first conference final in 1991 — his first of eight in a row. During that time, he was also the lead colour commentator on Edmonton Oilers local telecasts, working along with Bruce Buchanan. He left CBC in 1998 to join the fledgling CTV Sportsnet (now Rogers Sportsnet). He worked as a studio analyst on national broadcasts, as well as the colour commentator for the Calgary Flames games on Sportsnet West. During the 1994 NHL Lockout, he briefly worked for United Parcel Service of Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nSince the 2002–03 season, Garrett has served as the colour commentator for Canucks games on Sportsnet Pacific, first being partnered with Jim Hughson and later John Shorthouse. He also had occasional network assignments on HNIC and, since Rogers acquired the Canadian national contract for the NHL in 2014, he sometimes gets network assignments on either Sportsnet or City.\nOn March 23, 2023, Garrett announced his retirement from Canucks regional broadcasts at the conclusion of the 2022–23 NHL season. However, he will continue on Sportsnet's NHL coverage in a part-time capacity.\nNicknames.\nAfter the 1984-85 season, Garrett earned the nickname \"Lotto\" because his high goals-against average of 6.49 was the same as Canada's national lottery, Lotto 6/49.\nGarrett picked up his Cheech nickname from teammate Rick Smith in the mid-seventies. His afro haircut and moustache resembled Cheech from comedy duo Cheech and Chong."

        "title": "India–Pakistan cricket rivalry",
        "text": "The India–Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most intense sports rivalries in the world. The matches between these neighbouring countries are known for its intensity. It is considered as one of the biggest matches in the world, and is among the most-viewed sport games. It is often termed as the El Clásico of cricket.\nIndia has won 10 ICC tournaments compared to Pakistan's 5. At senior level, India has won 5 ICC trophies (2 Cricket World Cup, 1 T20 World Cup, 2 Champions Trophy), while Pakistan has won 3 (1 Cricket World Cup, 1 T20 World Cup, and 1 Champions Trophy). At the junior level, India has won 5 Under-19 World Cups, while Pakistan has won it twice.\nThe tense relations between the two nations, resulting from bitter diplomatic relationships and conflict that originated during the Partition of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947, the Indo-Pakistani Wars, and the Kashmir conflict, laid the foundations for the emergence of an intense sporting rivalry between the two nations who had shared a common cricketing heritage.\nThe two sides first played in 1952, when Pakistan toured India. Tests and, later, limited overs series have been played ever since, although a number of planned tours by both sides have been cancelled or aborted due to political factors. No cricket was played between the two countries between 1962 and 1977 due to two major wars in 1965 and 1971, and the 1999 Kargil War and the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks have also interrupted cricketing ties between the two nations.\nThe growth of large expatriate populations from both countries across the world led to neutral venues, including the United Arab Emirates and Canada, hosting bilateral and multilateral One Day International (ODI) series involving the two teams and the teams have met during International Cricket Council (ICC) competitions. Tickets for matches in which the two teams play each other at international competitions are in high demand, with over 800,000 applications for tickets made for the 2019 Cricket World Cup meeting between the two sides; the television transmission of the match was watched by 273 million viewers. \nPlayers from both teams routinely face intense pressure to win and are threatened by extreme reactions in defeat. Extreme fan reactions to defeats in key matches have been recorded, with a limited degree of hooliganism. At the same time, India–Pakistan matches have also offered opportunities for cricket diplomacy as a means to improve relations between the two countries by allowing heads of state to exchange visits and cricket followers from either country to travel to the other to watch the matches.\nHistory.\nThe Partition of British India in 1947 that led to the creation of independent Indian and Pakistani states was characterised by bloody conflict between ethnic groups that left one million people dead and led to the mass-migration of an estimated ten million people to the nation of their choice. The legacy of Partition and subsequent territorial disputes have helped create intense rivalries in field hockey, association football, and especially in cricket, which had been developed during British colonial rule and is the most popular sport in both nations.\nPakistan became a member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) in 1948, becoming a Full Member in July 1952. Their tour of India later the same year saw the team play their first Test matches. They lost the first Test in Delhi to India, but won the second Test in Lucknow, which led to an angry reaction from the home crowd against the Indian players. India clinched the Test series after winning the third Test in Bombay, but the intense pressure affected the players of both teams to the point that they pursued mainly defensive tactics that led to drawn matches and whole series without a victory. When India toured Pakistan in 1955, thousands of Indian fans were granted visas to go to the Pakistani city of Lahore to watch the Test match, but both the 1955 series and Pakistan's tour of India in 1961 ended in drawn series, with neither team being able to win a single Test match. Complaints about the fairness of umpires became routine.\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and subsequent War of 1971 put a hold on matches between the two sides that lasted till 1978, when India toured Pakistan and cricket between the two countries resumed for a brief period. In the post-1971 period, politics became a direct factor in the holding of cricketing events. India has suspended cricketing ties with Pakistan several times following terrorist attacks or other hostilities. The resumption of cricketing ties in 1978 came with the emergence of heads of government in both India and Pakistan who were not directly connected with the 1971 war and coincided with their formal initiatives to normalise bilateral relations. Shortly after a period of belligerency during the Operation Brasstacks war games, Pakistani president Zia-ul-Haq was invited to watch the India–Pakistan Test being played in the Indian city of Jaipur. This form of cricket diplomacy has occurred several times. Pakistan toured India in 1979, but an Indian tour of Pakistan in 1984 was cancelled mid-way through the series due to the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\nIn the late 1980s and for most of the 1990s, India and Pakistan played each other only at neutral venues such as Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and in the Canadian city of Toronto, where large audiences of expatriates regularly watched matches between the sides. The series between the teams in Canada in the 1990s and early 2000s were officially known as the \"Friendship Cup\". Sharjah, even though a neutral venue, was considered as the \"back yard of Pakistan\" given the close proximity and the massive support the team generated.\nThe rise of multinational competitions such as the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, the Austral-Asia Cup, and the Asia Cup led to more regular, albeit briefer, contests between the two sides.\nIn 1999, immediately following Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's historic visit to Pakistan, the Pakistani team toured India for a series of Test matches and One Day Internationals. The Kargil War later in the year caused tensions between the countries and cricket was again suspended. Vajpayee's peace initiative of 2003 led to India touring Pakistan after a gap of almost 15 years. Subsequent exchange tours were held in 2005 and 2006 before the 2008 Mumbai attacks led to the suspension of India's planned tour of Pakistan in 2009 and all future engagements in Pakistan. India has refused to play any form of series against Pakistan since then.\nThe 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore led to the suspension of international tours of Pakistan, with no Test series played in the country for a decade and Pakistan was removed as a co-host for the 2011 Cricket World Cup which had been due to be played across the Indian subcontinent. India and Pakistan qualified for the first semi-final of the tournament and the Indian government invited the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to watch the match along with his Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh.\nBilateral ties finally resumed when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) invited the Pakistan national team to tour India for three ODIs and two T20Is in December 2012. In June 2014, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that an agreement to play six bilateral series across eight years between the two teams had reached. After lengthy negotiations involving offers and counter-offers on the venues and scheduling of the first of these series in December 2015, the boards were unable to reach an agreement. In May 2017, the BCCI accounted that it would need approval from the Indian government before a bilateral series could go ahead. There was no further progress, despite members of both boards meeting in Dubai to discuss the matter.\nIn October 2021, during the T20 World Cup, the teams played their 200th international match against each other. Pakistan won the fixture by ten wickets, their first in 13 attempts against India in World Cup tournaments of either format.\nIn October 2021, following a meeting with the ACC, Ramiz Raja confirmed that Pakistan would host the Asia Cup in 2023, with Sri Lanka hosting the 2022 edition. In October 2022, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary and ACC President Jay Shah announced that India would not travel to Pakistan, citing security concerns, and that the Asia Cup 2023 would take place in a neutral venue. In December 2022, the then PCB chairman Ramiz Raja said that Pakistan might consider pulling out of the tournament if their hosting rights were withdrawn because of India's unwillingness to travel to Pakistan. The PCB had threatened to boycott the 2023 Cricket World Cup in India after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the Asia Cup. This issue would later be resolved, and Pakistan also eventually participate in the 2023 Cricket World Cup in India.\nIn January 2023, ACC confirmed the teams and groups of the Asia Cup, with both India and Pakistan taking part.\nIn March 2023, it was proposed that Pakistan remain as hosts and that all India matches - including at least two India-Pakistan contests - would be played at a neutral venue yet to be confirmed. The hybrid model proposed by Pakistan was rejected by Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In response, PCB Chairman Najam Sethi proposed two options. The first option was that India play all their matches at a neutral venue with Pakistan hosting the rest of the teams. The second option was that four matches in the group stage take place in Pakistan whereas the second phase, in which matches played by the Indian team followed by the next stage matches including the final, be played at a neutral venue. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh agreed to the second option. On 15 June 2023, the Asian Cricket Council announced that the tournament would be organized in a hybrid model with four matches being held in Pakistan, and the remaining nine in Sri Lanka.\nIndia and Pakistan met twice in this Asia Cup. Though the first match in the Group stage yielded a no result due to rain, India defeated Pakistan by an enormous margin in the Super Four clash between the 2 sides, scoring 356 for the loss of only 2 wickets. India in this match not only set their highest-ever score in ODI cricket against Pakistan, but also defeated them with the highest ever run margin of 228 runs, bundling Pakistan out for 128. India would eventually go on to win this Asia Cup, while Pakistan would be knocked out in the super-fours round.\nSummary of results.\nThe two sides have played a total of 206 times. Pakistan has won 88 matches compared to India's 74 victories. In Test matches and ODIs, Pakistan has won more matches than India, although India has won eight of the twelve T20 Internationals between the two sides compared to Pakistan's three.\nICC matches.\nIndia has the better record in the Cricket World Cup, having faced Pakistan 8 times in the Cricket World Cup since 1992. Pakistan have not managed to win a single game against India in the 31 years they have played against each other in World Cups. In the 2011 Cricket World Cup, India knocked out Pakistan in the semi-finals to qualify for the finals (which they subsequently won). The last time the two cricket frenzy nations clashed during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match played at the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad, India outclassed Pakistan by 7 wickets taking the scoreline to 8–0 in India's favour at ODI World Cups.\nIn T20 World Cups also, India has a superior record. India won the 2007 T20 World Cup by defeating Pakistan in the final. Pakistan registered its first ever win against India in a T20 World Cup match during the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nIn the Champions Trophy, however, Pakistan has won three of the five meetings between the two sides, including the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy Final, in which they defeated India after losing to them in the group stage. This was the second time the two teams had met in an ICC final after the T20 final in 2007. Pakistan are currently the tournament's defending champions.\nThe two sides currently do not play test matches with each other and have not met in the World Test Championship yet.\nACC matches.\nThe teams have met on 19 occasions in the Asia Cup, including Twenty20 format matches. India has won ten of these meetings compared to Pakistan's seven victories with two match finishing as no result due to rain.\nICC tournaments won.\nThe two countries have played in World Cups, the Champions Trophy, and the World Test Championship, all of which are organised by the governing body of world cricket, the International Cricket Council. India has won 5 ICC tournaments compared to Pakistan's 3. At senior-level, India has won 5 ICC trophies (2 Cricket World Cups, 1 T20 World Cup, 2 Champions Trophy), while Pakistan has won 3 (1 Cricket World Cup, 1 T20 World Cup, 1 Champions Trophy)\nIndia has won the ICC Cricket World Cup twice and Pakistan has done so once. Each side has won the ICC Men's T20 World Cup once, with the first edition of the tournament in 2007 featuring a final between the two sides which India won. In the ICC Champions Trophy, another ODI tournament, India won the trophy twice, while Pakistan won the 2017 edition, defeating India in the final. Neither team has won the World Test Championship, although India finished as runners-up in both the editions, having played in the finals.\nACC tournaments Won.\nBoth teams have participated in 15 of the 16 Asia Cups hosted. India withdrew from the second edition of the Asian Test Championship, having only played the first while Pakistan took part in both editions. The record sways 8–3 in India's favour at ACC Tournaments.\nList of Test series.\nOverall Test match results.\nFifteen Test series have been played between the two sides, as well as a one-off Test played in February 1999 as part of the Asian Test Championship. India has hosted eight of the series, with 32 matches played at home as well as the one-off match in 1999. Pakistan has hosted seven series with 26 matches played at home. Each side has four series wins, although Pakistan has won more Test matches than India in matches between the two nations.\nList of ODI series.\nOverall ODI match results.\nThe two sides have played a total of 17 ODI series. Six of these have been played in India, while Pakistan has hosted seven series. Four series have been played in neutral venues, including three in Canada between 1996 and 1998 and one in the United Arab Emirates in 2006. Pakistan has won 11 of the series with India winning five. The two-match series held in the UAE was tied, each team winning one match.\nList of T20I series.\nOverall T20I match results.\nThe teams have only played one Twenty20 International series, a two match series played in 2012 as part of Pakistan's tour of India. Each team won one match, leaving the series drawn.\nRecords.\nTwenty20 International records.\nThe two sides have played each other twelve times in Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). Seven of these matches have taken place during T20 World Cups, including their meeting during the final of the 2007 competition, and three at the Asia Cup. A single two-match T20I series was played in India in 2012.\nThe highest team score made in a T20I between the two nations was India's 192/5 made at Ahmedabad in December 2012. Pakistan's highest score against India in T20I is 182/5 made during 2022 Asia Cup match. The lowest score in a T20I between the two counties was Pakistan's 83 all out made at Dhaka during the 2016 Asia Cup.\nThe highest individual score made in a T20I between the two sides was Virat Kohli's 82 not out made in October 2022 during the 2022 ICC World Twenty20. India's Virat Kohli holds the record for the most runs scored overall in matches between the two sides with 488 runs scored in ten innings.\nThe best bowling performance in matches between the sides was the 4/18 taken by Mohammad Asif during the group stage meeting between the teams at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. India's best bowling performance was the 3/8 taken by Hardik Pandya during the 2016 WorldT20. Pakistan's Umar Gul has taken the most wickets in matches between the sides with 11.\nPlayers who have played for both teams.\nPrior to the Partition of India in 1947 India had played cricket, having first played as an international side in 1932. Following Partition, Pakistan was created and began playing as an independent nation, making their Test match debut in 1952 during a tour of India.\nThree players played for Pakistan after appearing for India. They are:\nAfter Partition, Gul Mohammad continued to play for India until 1955 and played against Pakistan in their first tour of India in 1951–52. Both Amir Elahi and Abdul Hafeez Kardar played for Pakistan on the tour. Abdul Hafeez Kardar went on to play for Pakistan against India during India's first tour of Pakistan in 1954–55.\nPublic and government reaction to the rivalry.\nCricket is a significant sport within both countries and matches involving them can provoke what has been described as \"a strong response\".\nIn the Indian cricket team in Pakistan in the 1989–90 series, the 3rd ODI at Karachi was abandoned due to crowd disturbance. When Pakistan lost 3 wickets at the score of 28, stone pelting started against Indian fielders. Indian fielders gathered near the pitch. Local cricketer Javed Miandad was unable to calm the crowd and the match was abandoned. Chandu Borde said that in the same match, Mohammad Azharuddin was hit with a metal hook. Sanjay Manjrekar wrote in his book, in the first ODI, that Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth's shirt was torn by a Pakistani spectator.\nThere have been examples where fans of the opposing side have experienced legal action: in 2014, 60 students in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh were charged with sedition for cheering Pakistan's victory over India, although the charges were later dropped; in 2016, a 22-year-old Pakistani fan of Indian captain Virat Kohli, was arrested and later sentenced to 10-years imprisonment for hoisting India's flag in Pakistan after a match between India and Australia. After the T20 World Cup 2021 match between the two teams, Indian authorities arrested a small number of Indian Muslims who had publicly celebrated Pakistan's victory.\nIn the city of Leicester in the United Kingdom, tensions between the Indian Hindu and Pakistan Muslim community broke out into violence and a series of protests following the 2022 Asia Cup match between Pakistan and India on 28 August.\nCricket diplomacy between India and Pakistan.\nFollowing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in February 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General Zia ul-Haq, attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions since it led to a meeting with the Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. Furthermore, in 2004 after a break of fifteen years, India toured Pakistan in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.\nIn an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General Pervez Musharraf came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged \"to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir.\" Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. In 1991, the workers of the Indian political party Shiv Sena dug up the cricket pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on the eve of an India-Pakistan Test match which was to be held there, forcing the entire series between the two nations to be cancelled. The Shiv Sena once again used this unique means of protest at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi in 2000 to protest against the Pakistan cricket team's proposed visit. Following the Kargil conflict, and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.\nDuring the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the semi-final is believed to have eased the relationship between India and Pakistan after the polarising 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh used this opportunity and greeted his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani to watch the match with him at Mohali. Gilani subsequently accepted the offer and agreed to watch the match with Singh."

        "title": "Zimbabwean cricket crisis",
        "text": "Cricket in Zimbabwe suffered a crisis that lasted from 2003 to 2011 where player withdrawals such as the \"Black-armband protest\" by Andy Flower and Henry Olonga along with a mass loss of players in 2004 due to a general strike resulted in very poor performances by the national team. Presently Zimbabwe is in the period of rebuilding itself as the domestic structure was re-structured in 2009. Many people allege that the administration of cricket in Zimbabwe was corrupted by the influence of Robert Mugabe's government, who were widely accused of following racist, in particular anti-white, policies. Positive signs began to emerge for Zimbabwe after the 2007 Cricket World Cup especially when in the 2007 World Twenty20 Zimbabwe defeated what was arguably the strongest side in the world at the time, Australia. Along with this Zimbabwe gradually began to show encouraging signs of improvement and four years later they returned to the highest format of the game, Test Cricket. In their first match since their return in August 2011 they comprehensively defeated Bangladesh.\nCrisis emerges.\nDuring the 2000–01 season, players began to allege political interference in the running of the game in Zimbabwe. There had already been a reduction in government funding for the sport's development. The players alleged that selection of the national team was subject to interference and particularly resented the imposition of a quota system to ensure a minimum number of black players would be included. The players argued that the black players were gradually emerging, as in South Africa, and that they would increase in due course. For example, Hamilton Masakadza had already made his mark as a batsman, and Mluleki Nkala and Henry Olonga were making their mark as bowlers.\nThe matter came to prominence before the 2003 World Cup, when both the British prime minister Tony Blair and the Australian prime minister John Howard said they would prefer it if their teams did not travel to Zimbabwe, but did not ban them from doing so. In the event, only England refused to travel to Harare to play Zimbabwe after a vote by the players citing security concerns after death threats were received, thereby forfeiting the match. In Zimbabwe's first match, two players, one white, one black (Andy Flower and Henry Olonga) wore black armbands in protest against \"the death of democracy in Zimbabwe\". Both players subsequently retired and emigrated from Zimbabwe, under intense political pressure, with the black Olonga being denounced as not really Zimbabwean as he was born in Zambia.\nTeam hits rock bottom.\nIn 2004, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union sacked their white captain Heath Streak after he had confronted them with the team's grievances, several other players having also resigned by this time. Streak was replaced by the young and untested Tatenda Taibu. Fifteen senior players were involved in a stand-off over this and other selection issues, resulting in their dismissal from Zimbabwean cricket. Following poor performances by a second-string (and almost all black) Zimbabwe team against Sri Lanka, the ZCU and ICC agreed that Zimbabwe would play no Test cricket in 2004, and this self-imposed suspension remained in force from 10 June 2004 to 6 January 2005.\nIn their first match after the suspension, Zimbabwe lost to Bangladesh at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong by 226 runs. The second and final match in the series was drawn. Bangladesh had until then been generally considered the weakest team in Test cricket, and by beating Zimbabwe, recorded its first ever Test match and series victories. Bangladesh then defeated Zimbabwe in a limited overs series.\nIn February and March 2005, Zimbabwe toured South Africa to play three ODIs and two Tests. Zimbabwe was completely and hopelessly outclassed, and Wisden 2006 described the tour as \"\"gruesome\" and \"embarrassing to all who saw it\"\".\nMeanwhile, in domestic cricket, the Logan Cup had been played, with just four participants, and had been won as usual by Mashonaland. But it is debatable if the competition should have retained first-class status and there were grave doubts about its future: see 2004–05 Zimbabwean cricket season.\nIn August 2005, the New Zealand cricket team arrived in Zimbabwe to play two Test matches and duly won both by an innings with embarrassing ease. The tour was inevitably preceded by controversy because of strong feeling in New Zealand about Mugabe. As with the previous England and Australia situations, the New Zealand government advised the team not to go but did not actually bar them from doing so. Since the ICC would not accept any other reason for non-attendance, the New Zealand players turned up and won easily. However, the NZ government did have some fight in them because they effectively banned a return tour by refusing to issue visas to the Zimbabwean party.\nDuring the New Zealand series, Zimbabwe Cricket fired national coach Phil Simmons. The players signed a petition to denounce the decision and Simmons took ZC to court while they tried to have him deported.\nIn September 2005, the visitors were India; like New Zealand, India was not barred from going to Zimbabwe and decided to go to avert ICC sanctions. In India's case, controversy erupted within its own team on account of arguments between team captain Sourav Ganguly and the new coach Greg Chappell. This row diverted the sport's attention from Zimbabwe and shifted the focus onto India. Despite its problems, the Indian team won both matches easily against sub-standard opposition.\nThere had been a brief reconciliation with some of the rebel players, Heath Streak and Andy Blignaut having played in some of the 2005 Tests, but then the Simmons affair sparked a wider mutiny under Taibu's leadership. In October 2005, Streak announced his retirement from international cricket and indicated that he would concentrate on a county career with Warwickshire CCC in England. In November 2005, Taibu resigned as captain. He stated that: \"If we don't do anything, cricket in Zimbabwe will die within a year\". Taibu is now playing as an overseas player for Namibia in South African provincial competition. He, however, was surprisingly a member of the 07/08 squad for the series against Pakistan in Pakistan. Taibu was then a key cog in the national team.\nHopes fade in 2006.\nAs 2006 began, Mugabe's government replaced the board of Zimbabwe Cricket with an interim committee and this announced a further twelve month withdrawal from Test cricket. Meanwhile, the 2005–06 Logan Cup did not get under way and all the matches were indefinitely postponed. However the 2006–07 Logan Cup did take place.\nDuring 2006, Zimbabwe played a few ODIs only but was soundly beaten by Bangladesh and also lost twice to ICC associate member Kenya.\n\"For more information about the tours since 2005, see\" : \nThe domestic game seemed to have all but deteriorated and hopes of a return to the promise that Zimbabwe showed in the 1990s looked to be forlorn.\nCricket resurgence (2007–2011).\nBy late 2007 the Zimbabwean team had defeated Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and gradually signs emerged as Zimbabwe began to build on these small blocks and improve their performance bit by bit. By 2010 Zimbabwe Cricket informed the International Cricket Council that they intended to return to Test Cricket after the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the ICC agreed as a result of Zimbabwe's improving performance. In August 2011 Zimbabwe played their first Test Match in 6 years and won comprehensively defeating Bangladesh. Following the victory in the one-off Test Match, Zimbabwe sealed the ODI series 3–2.\nDuring this period of time Zimbabwe Cricket restructured itself domestically and from grassroots levels, new domestic teams emerged and a full-fledged Domestic Twenty20 tournament has seen the country's cricket infrastructure improve. The team also plans to build a stadium near Victoria Falls and has renovated Harare Sports Club along with Queen's Sports Club in Bulawayo.\nPlayer pay dispute.\nIn 2013, another dispute engulfed Zimbabwe Cricket. Players threatened to strike during Zimbabwe's ODI series against Pakistan in August. Negotiations made sure that players went out to play against Pakistan. Surprisingly, the unpaid Zimbabwe players defeated Pakistan in one of the three ODIs. \nThe first test of the Test series was also under threat of a player strike but ZC made sure a team was fielded for the Test. Brendan Taylor decided not to believe ZC and sat out of the first test. Zimbabwe went on to beat a lacklustre Pakistan side in the second test match, sparking hopes of recovery for Zimbabwean cricket.\nThese hopes were short-lived as the pay dispute got intense in December 2013, when Zimbabwean players went on strike which led to a suspension of the four- and one-day tournaments that were underway."

        "text": "Cricket has had a number of controversies relating to players being involved with the betting aspects of the game. In particular, numerous players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches, aspects of matches (e.g. the toss) or provide other information.\n1999–2000 India-South Africa match fixing scandal.\nIn 2000, the Delhi police intercepted a conversation between a blacklisted bookie and the South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje in which they learnt that Cronje accepted money to throw matches. The South African government refused to allow any of its players to face the Indian investigation unit. A court of inquiry was set up and Cronje admitted to throwing matches. He was immediately banned from all cricket. He also named Saleem Malik (Pakistan), Mohammed Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja (both India).\n2018 Sri Lanka cricket pitch tampering scandal.\nOn 26 May 2018 Al Jazeera news channel findings depict that possibly pitch tampering would have happened during the home test matches involving Sri Lanka against Australia in 2016 and against India in 2017. The news channel also stated that through monitoring the pitch conditions the fixers have managed easily to make money. Match-fixers Robin Morris, a former Indian domestic cricketer along with Dubai based business person Gaurav Rajkumar, Galle groundsman Tharanga Indika and Sri Lankan first-class cricketer Tharindu Mendis have also been investigated by the ICC for attempting another pitch tampering at Galle in Sri Lanka's forthcoming first test match against England as a part of the England's upcoming series against Sri Lanka in November 2018. Concerns also raised by the English Cricket Board whether to play away series against Sri Lanka over the planned pitch tampering at the Galle Cricket Stadium for the first Test match.\nOther controversies.\nDuring the third Test of the 1981 Ashes series, Australian players Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh placed a bet on England to win the match after the odds had ballooned out to 500–1. Australia were widely expected to win the match with England at 135-7 after having been made to follow-on. In a remarkable rear-guard effort, England did indeed win the match following brilliant performances from Ian Botham and Bob Willis, and Lillee and Marsh duly collected £7,500 (). There has never been any suggestion that the players deliberately underperformed to ensure their bet succeeded; nevertheless, the failure of cricket authorities to censure Lillee and Marsh at the time has led some to suggest that it contributed to the match-fixing scandals of the 1990s and 2000s.\nAnother scandal was Mark Waugh and Shane Warne's payments from \"John the bookmaker\" on a tour of Sri Lanka in 1994. The players had received $4,000 and $5,000 respectively from the bookmaker for pitch and weather information. When the then Australian Cricket Board found out about the incident in 1995, it fined the players. Nevertheless, the board withheld the information from the general public at the time, who were not informed until 1998. The Australian Cricket Board received widespread criticism for not immediately announcing the scandal. A later report by Rob O'Regan QC concluded that cricketers were not fully informed about the dangers of interacting with bookmakers, and although no further punishment could be given to either Waugh or Warne, in future players should be punished by not only fines, but also by suspensions.\nThe ICC was slow to react, but did eventually in 2000 set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit headed by Sir Paul Condon, former head of London's Metropolitan Police. It claims to have reduced corruption in cricket to a \"reducible minimum\".\nDuring the fourth Test of 2010 Pakistani tour of England, \"News of the World\" published a story with allegations that Mazhar Majeed and some of the Pakistani players were involved in spot fixing. Pakistani players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were later jailed and banned from cricket.\nIn 2013, three cricketers from New Zealand were approached by the ICC in regards to match fixing, later named as Lou Vincent, Chris Cairns and Daryl Tuffey. In 2014, Vincent admitted to being involved in match fixing."

        "title": "World Cricket League",
        "text": "The ICC World Cricket League (WCL) was a series of international one-day cricket tournaments for national teams without Test status (i.e., teams of Associate status) administered by the International Cricket Council. All Associate Members of the ICC were eligible to compete in the league system, which featured a promotion and relegation structure between divisions. The league system had two main aims: to provide a qualification system for the Cricket World Cup that could be accessed by all Associate Members and as an opportunity for these sides to play international one-day matches against teams of similar standards.\nThe league began in 2007, where teams were allocated into divisions based on their performance in the qualification tournaments for the 2007 World Cup; the six initial teams in Division One were the teams that had qualified for the 2007 World Cup. At this stage, there were only five divisions. The WCL expanded to eight divisions at one point.\nThe WCL was a pathway to the Cricket World Cup until 2019. Following the conclusion of the 2019 Division Two tournament, the WCL was replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League. The final rankings from the WCL were used to place teams into the two new leagues.\nStructure.\nThe initial league began in 2007 with seven tournaments over five global divisions, based upon previous world rankings. This was expanded into eight separate divisions by 2010. In the first cycle, the number of teams in each tournament varied from six to twelve. With the advent of the second cycle, the number of teams was regularised to six for each tournament, with the exception of the lowest division, Division 8, in which eight teams played. As from 2015, the number of divisions was again reduced to just five.\nWhen most of the divisions are played, two teams will be promoted, two relegated and two remain for the next instalment (normally two years later). At the end of each cycle, a World Cup Qualifier is played. In 2018, this featured the four lowest teams of those holding 'Full' (senior) status, together with six 'Associate' nations namely the four who were still in Division One, plus the top two from Division Two. The two last-placed teams in that World Cup Qualifier lost their ODI status and were relegated into Division Two.\nRegional tournaments, which act as qualifiers for the lowest division of the World League, are administered by the five development regions of the International Cricket Council: Africa, Americas, Asia, East Asia-Pacific, and Europe.\nAssociate one-day rankings.\nIn late 2005, the International Cricket Council ranked the top non-Test nations from 11–30 to complement the Test nations' rankings in the ICC ODI Championship. The ICC used the results from the 2005 ICC Trophy and WCQS Division 2 competition (i.e. the primary qualification mechanisms for the 2007 Cricket World Cup) to rank the nations.\nThese rankings were used to seed the initial stage of the global World Cricket League. Teams ranked 11–16 were placed into Division 1; teams 17–20 were placed into Division 2; teams 21–24 were placed into Division 3; the remaining teams were placed into the upper divisions of their respective regional qualifiers.\nIn 2005, six associates were assigned One Day International status, based on their performance at the preceding World Cup Qualifier. In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland were both promoted to \"Full\" (test-match) status, leaving only four associate nations with ODI-status: after mid-March 2018 these were Scotland, Netherlands, UAE, and Nepal. Netherlands, as winners of the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship, have qualified for a place in the 2020–22 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nIn May 2009, the ICC added a rankings table for the associate and affiliate members containing both global and regional placings. In 2016 this changed to maintain a global list only for the top teams and a set of regional lists for the remaining teams.\nRankings.\nThe global rankings of associate teams according to ICC are published in the table below. Teams that have One Day International status are now included on the main ICC ODI Championship and are listed in the order they appear on that table. The other teams are ranked by their finishing position in the most recent qualifying tournament.\nThe rankings at the end of the WCL (27 April 2019):\nRegional rankings.\nTeams that do not participate in (or have been relegated from) the World Cricket League are ranked by their finishing positions in their respective regional leagues:"

Inclement weather forced the cancellation of the third-place game on August 27 and the postponement of the championship game also scheduled for that date. The Northern Little League of Columbus, Georgia, defeated Kawaguchi City Little League of Kawaguchi, Japan, in the championship game of the 60th Little League World Series.\nThe event was broadcast in the United States on ABC Sports, ESPN and ESPN2 in both analog and high-definition. The U.S. Championship game was the last ABC Sports telecast. Games were held in the two stadiums located at Little League headquarters in South Williamsport:\nTeams.\nBetween five and twelve teams take part in 16 regional qualification tournaments, which vary in format depending on region. In the United States, the qualification tournaments are in the same format as the Little League World Series itself: a round-robin tournament followed by an elimination round to determine the regional champion.\nResults.\nPool play.\nThe top two teams in each pool moved on to their respective semifinals. The winners of each met on August 27 to play for the Little League World Championship. Teams marked in \"green\" qualified to the knockout stage. Ties are broken based on records in head-to-head competition among tied teams. If a clear winner cannot be determined from head-to-head results, the tie is broken by calculating the ratio of runs allowed to defensive innings played for all teams involved in the tie. The team with the lowest runs-per-defensive-inning ratio advances.\nUnited States.\nAll times US EDT\nInternational.\nAll times US EDT\nElimination round.\n\"The consolation game between Matamoros, Mexico and Beaverton, Oregon, scheduled for August 27 at Volunteer Stadium, was cancelled due to rain, and both teams share third place. The championship game was originally scheduled for 3:30 pm US EDT on August 27, but was postponed due to rain. The game was originally rescheduled for 8:00 pm on August 28, but changed because of weather concerns.\"\nChampion's path.\nThe Columbus Northern LL went undefeated on their road to the LLWS, winning all eleven of their matches. Their total record was 16–1, their only loss coming against Lemont LL (from Illinois).\nMid-Island incident.\nTelevision coverage aired throughout the United States on ABC Sports and ESPN. At first, there was no delay on its broadcasts, despite the fact that all managers and coaches were equipped with miniature microphones. That changed after two incidents; one in a preliminary game where an unidentified California pitcher told his coach that \"[the umpire] ain't giving me shit\" in reference to a tight strike zone, but the other, more important incident took place late in a preliminary-round game in which a player for Mid-Island Little League of Staten Island, New York, who was not publicly identified, told his teammates to just score \"one fucking run\" that was broadcast live on ESPN. In response, the team's manager, Nick Doscher, slapped the player, a violation of a Little League policy against physical contact targeting players. Both the player and manager were reprimanded, and ESPN and ABC imposed a five-second delay on future telecasts. The incident was part of the continuing legacy of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy."

        "text": "Henry Thomas Phillips (22 June 1903 – 16 December 1978) was a Welsh international rugby union lock who played club rugby for Cross Keys and Newport and international rugby for Wales. Phillips was a collier by profession before becoming a police officer, and was the nephew of former international Wales player Harry Day.\nRugby career.\nPhillips was born in Crosskeys, and began his rugby career with local team Cross Keys RFC, before moving to first class team Newport. He played rugby with Newport from 1923, and was given various roles within the pack, though he played mainly second row and prop. In 1926, Phillips faced his first international opposition when he was part of the Newport team that played the touring Māoris. The game ended in a 0–0 draw, a score which the Māori captain, Wattie Barclay, believed his team was fortunate to achieve.\nIn 1927, Phillips was given his first international call-up, when he was selected for the opening game of the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Bernard Turnbull, Phillips' debut was against England at Twickenham which Wales lost 9–11. Phillips played in all the matches of the 1927 Championship which saw poor Welsh results, with only a single win, over France. Despite the poor run of results, Phillips was reselected for the Wales game against the New South Wales Waratahs, who he had faced just a month earlier with Newport. The Wales team included eight new caps, which the far tighter Waratahs were able to defeat, finishing the match 18–8 winners.\nPhillips played in all four games of the 1928 Championship, which was as miserable a campaign as 1927. The Welsh won just once, the first ever victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Although a historic win, this was the start of a poor run of results for Scotland who finished the tournament with just a single win too. Worse for Wales was the loss to France. Wales had beaten France in the previous twelve encounters, and this was the first time Wales had lost to the French team. This final game of the tournament saw five Welsh players represent Wales for the last time, Phillips was one of them.\nPhillips continued representing Newport after the end of his international career, and in the 1929/30 season he was given the captaincy of the Newport first team. He left Newport in 1931.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)"

        "text": "A number of video games have been made of Le Mans 24 Hours. The race, the Circuit de la Sarthe, and competing cars have been featured in racing games such as the \"Gran Turismo\" series.\nHistory.\nThe first Le Mans video game was in 1976 by Atari, an upright standing arcade game with a steering wheel and white raster graphics on a black background.\nIn 1982, Commodore released a Le Mans game for the Commodore 64, which was actually a clone of a 1979 Sega game, Monaco GP.\nNext came the arcade game \"WEC Le Mans\", developed by Konami and released in 1986. For the following year, this arcade game was subsequently ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum by Ocean Software. The game broke down the race in four laps (two on daytime and two after sunset), divided as well into three checkpoints. Due to the limitations of the hardware, all cars have the same design and do not correspond to actual models. The advertising in both sides of the road is also limited to the name of the game and its creators.\nOver ten years later, in 1997, Sega released the arcade exclusive \"Le Mans 24\". As a Japanese publisher, the game marked a debut for the 1991 winner, the Mazda 787B, before appearing in subsequent driving games including the later \"Gran Turismo\" series, the 1971 JWA Gulf Porsche 917K appears as a bonus car.\nTwo years later, the French video game publisher Infogrames, who incidentally absorbed Ocean, released \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" for PlayStation and PC. The game was developed by UK company Eutechnyx. In the US the game was released under the name \"Test Drive: Le Mans\".\nIn the following year the same software house released \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" on the Dreamcast. This version of the game was originally planned to be a port from the PlayStation, but was eventually developed from scratch by Australian company Melbourne House which had recently been purchased by Infogrames. As with the previous PlayStation version, the Dreamcast game was released in the US under their \"Test Drive\" brand as \"Test Drive: Le Mans\". This was one of the most critically acclaimed racing games on the Dreamcast, often hailed as the single best driving game available for the Dreamcast system. Following the release of the Dreamcast version of \"Le Mans 24 Hours\", Infogrames and Melbourne House developed and released a port of the Dreamcast game on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.\nIn 2002, a PC port of the \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" game was created by another Australian video game developer, Torus.\nThe circuit appears in \"Gran Turismo 4\", released in 2004. The game uses the then-current layout and can be run with or without the two chicanes. The player can race against 5 other AI cars in a full-24 Hour long race on both the Circuit de la Sarthe with the chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight or without them. The opponent vehicles range from Le Mans Prototype cars, such as the BMW V12 LMR and the Audi R8, to Group C-spec sports prototypes, such as the Sauber C9 and the Mazda 787B.\nSeveral versions of the Circuit in its past and present layouts have been made by the user community for the 2005 rFactor and 2006 \"GTR 2\" driving simulation and the rFactor WEC mod version of Le Mans Racing Legends.\nIn \"Race Driver Grid\", released in 2008, the player is able to race at Le Mans, in a condensed 12-minute race, 24-minute race, one hour race, and so forth to full 24-hours race. According to the time scale chosen, day and night occur at different times. Cars &amp; drivers from the 2006 Race are featured. The Circuit de la Sarthe depicted in the game is much wider, with corners such as Dunlop and Arnage having a much shorter run in, and with significant elevation changes on the track (such as the Hunaudières curve) almost imperceptible.\nThe entire circuit is available for racing in \"Forza Motorsport 3\" and again in 2011 in \"Forza Motorsport 4\", in 2013 in \"Forza Motorsport 5\", in 2015 in \"Forza Motorsport 6\", in 2017 in \"Forza Motorsport 7\", and in 2023 in \"Forza Motorsport\".\n\"Gran Turismo 5\", released in November 2010, also includes the Le Mans circuit, along with two 24 hour races. Variations include the 2005 version and 2009 version, which has the redeveloped area around the Dunlop Curve with more run-off area, and the extended pit lane exit. There is also the option of changeable time of day, and variable weather. The successor of GT5, \"Gran Turismo 6\", released in December 2013, includes not only the 2005 and 2009 version, but also the 2013 version. Both \"Gran Turismo Sport\" and \"Gran Turismo 7\" also feature the track.\n\"iRacing\", released in 2008, has the addition of the Le Mans circuit in 2016, featuring the track as it was configured for the 2015 event. It is also possible to use the 2015 layout with the Mulsanne chicanes removed.\n\"Project CARS\" and \" Project CARS 2\" of Slightly Mad Studios included Circuit de la Sarthe under the project name Loire.\n\"rFactor 2\" is currently used to host the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual esports event, which saw big names such as three-time Formula One World Champion Max Verstappen and former NASCAR driver Juan Pablo Montoya participate. Hosted by Motorsport Games, the 2020 installment saw two red flags, with the 2023 edition of the race seeing the servers suffering a security breach and rFactor 2's stability being called into question."

He was a star athlete at Okmulgee High School before enrolling at Stanford University in 1932. Reynolds was a large man, standing tall and weighing between . At Stanford, Reynolds played for the varsity football team in the 1933, 1934 and 1935 seasons.\nIn 1932, Reynolds played for Stanford's freshman football team. The team included Reynolds, Bobby Grayson, Jim \"Monk\" Moscrip and Bob \"Bones\" Hamilton, and came to be known as the \"Vow Boys.\" The 1932 Stanford varsity team was soundly defeated by the USC Trojans. After watching the defeat, the freshmen players got together and vowed that they would never lose to the Trojans. The Stanford team proceeded to beat USC three straight years from 1933 to 1935, making good on the vow. Stanford was the dominant team on the Pacific Coast, appearing in the New Year's Day Rose Bowl Game in each of those three years. Reynolds established a record that has never been matched by playing in every minute of three consecutive Rose Bowl games. In each of those games, Reynold played all 60 minutes on offense and defense without substitution. Two years after Reynolds completed the feat, \"Los Angeles Times\" sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote:\"A young man arrived in town yesterday enjoying perhaps the most unique distinction in the history of the Tournament of Roses football. He is the only athlete who ever played through three consecutive Rose Bowl games without substitution. His name is Bob Reynolds. You may recall him as 'Horse' Reynolds. … Reynolds left the field that afternoon with no fanfare or trumpets but on January 1, 1936, he set a record which may never be equalled in this annual classic. He was never removed for a substitute during any of the three games.\"\nWhile playing at Stanford, Reynolds acquired the nickname, \"The Horse.\" While most observers assumed that the nickname was derived from Reynolds' size and strength, it was actually based on a prank directed at Reynolds during his freshman year at Stanford. When Reynolds left campus for a weekend, a group of classmates led a horse up the steps of the dormitory and into Reynolds' room. The horse remained in the room until Reynolds returned on Monday morning, by which time the horse had eaten through the drapes and all of Reynolds' notebooks and some of his textbooks. From that day forward, Reynolds was known as \"The Horse.\"\nHe was a consensus All-American at the tackle position in 1934, receiving that designation from the Associated Press, International News Service (later merged into UPI), and the \"New York Sun\". In 1935, he was again selected as a first-team All-American tackle by the \"New York Sun\". The profile of Reynolds at the College Football Hall of Fame referred to Reynols as \"the plow which dug deep furrows in enemy defenses,\" and also noted that he \"knocked people down like they were wooden statues.\"\nLater years.\nAfter \"deciding he'd had enough football,\" Reynolds moved to Texas and Oklahoma and worked in the oil business in 1936 and 1937. Reynolds had been drafted by the Green Bay Packers, but decided not to play professional football. In 1937, G.A. Richards, a millionaire radio station owner who also owned the Detroit Lions, invited Reynolds to come to Detroit to talk things over. Reynolds told Richards he had no interest in playing for the Lions, but noted that he did have an interest in working at Richards' Los Angeles radio station KMPC. Richards proposed a coin toss. If Richards called it right, Reynolds would play two years for the Lions and work at KMPC in the off-seasons. If Reynolds called it right, he would have the radio job without any obligation to play for the Lions. Richards won the coin toss, and Reynolds signed a double contract — to play football for the Lions in the fall and to work for KMPC in the off-seasons.\nReynolds played 20 games as a tackle for the Lions in 1937 and 1938. During the offseason in 1938, Reynolds joined the sales staff of Richards' Los Angeles radio station KMPC. In 1942, Reynolds was named vice president and general manager of KMPC. When Reynolds joined KMPC, it was a small 5,000-watt station. In 1947, KMPC received approval from the FCC to increase its broadcasting power to 50,000 watts, making it Southern California's most powerful independent radio station.\nIn May 1951, G.A. Richards died leaving the station under the management of Reynolds and Loyd Sigmon — the KMPC engineer who developed the traffic Sig Alert. Reyolds contacted Gene Autry and advised that he had the inside track to acquire the station and its valuable real estate holdings from Richards' widow. Autry and Reynolds acquired the station together and founded Golden West Broadcasting. Golden West eventually owned and operated KMPC radio and KTLA television in Los Angeles and KSFO in San Francisco. Reynolds served for many years as the president of Golden West Broadcasting. Reynolds also served two terms as the president of the Southern California Broadcasters Association. (Reynolds was no relation to the Bob Reynolds who served as sports director and Lions announcer for Detroit station WJR for many years.)\nIn 1960, Reynolds and Autry founded the Major League Baseball expansion team the Los Angeles Angels. At the time that he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a \"baseball man\" and his long relationship with Autry:\"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, 'occurred the minute we were given the franchise, and I found out I had a little personal investment at stake.' … 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. Now we have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'\" Reynolds served as president and co-owner of the Angels from the team's first season in 1961 until 1974. He stepped down as president of the Angels and sold his 20% ownership interest to Autry at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1974.\nIn 1961, Reynolds was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. At the time, Reynolds said, \"A fellow has to be lucky to be so honored. My good fortune was being able to play on great teams with fellows like Monk Moscrip, Bones Hamilton, Bobby Grayson and the rest.\"\nIn August 1966, Reynolds was honored with a night in his honor at a California Angels ballgame. At the time, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist John Hall wrote:\"The contributions and the accomplishments of the large man with the large smile have too long been taken for granted.. As a partner of Gene Autry, it is natural perhaps that his role would be overshadowed by the glamor of a movie box office king. … But those closest to the scene will tell you it is Reynolds who is the dynamo of the gang ...\"\nReynolds was also a co-owner, vice president and a director of the Los Angeles Rams football team from 1963 until 1972. In 1966, Reynolds led a group of five Rams owners, each representing 8.16% of the shares, in advocating the establishment of an NFL franchise playing at Anaheim Stadium in Orange County, California. The Rams would eventually move to Anaheim for the 1980 season.\nReynolds also served for 16 years as a member of the University of California Board of Regents. He was also a member of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.\nIn 1972, Reynolds received the Distinguished American Award from the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame.\nReynolds died in 1994 at age 79 in San Rafael, California. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three sons, Chris, Dan and Kirk."

        "text": "At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the Archery competitions were held between 9 August and 15 August, at the Olympic Green Archery Field, a temporary venue on the Olympic Green, Beijing's Olympic Park.\nCompetition format.\nBoth men and women have the same size targets (1.22 m) and stand the same distance away from their target (70 m). The score for each arrow is determined by how close to the center of the target it hits, with a score of 10 for hitting directly in the center, down to 0 points if the target is missed entirely or the archer fails to shoot within the time limit of 40 seconds per arrow. Medals were awarded in four events: Men's Individual, Women's Individual, Men's Team, and Women's Team.\nIndividual.\n64 archers compete in both the men's and women's individual competition. A preliminary ranking round is held at 70 m, where each archer shoots 72 arrows (in six ends, or groups, of 12 arrows). The resulting score is used to seed the archers into a single elimination bracket.\nUnlike in Athens, the archers who win the first round of the individual competition, will compete immediately in the following round, without waiting for the general conclusion of the eliminations. The order of shooting will be given by the placement of the archers after the ranking round. \nThe archers shoot 12 arrows in ends of 3 arrows.\nTeam.\nEach country that has three archers in the individual competition may also compete in the team competition. The scores from the individual ranking round are summed to determine the team score that is used to seed the teams in a single elimination bracket. \nMatches consist of each team shooting 24 arrows (in Athens they shot 27) in 4 ends of 6 arrows, with each archer on the team shooting 8 arrows.\nQualification.\nThe athlete quota for archery is 128 athletes, 64 men and 64 women. Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can have up to a maximum of six athletes, three per gender. NOC's with three athletes of the same gender automatically qualify for the team competition. Athletes do not qualify themselves directly into the Olympics. They can only earn \"qualification spots\" for their respective NOC's. The NOC's, in turn, decide which of the athletes who have achieved the MQS (Minimum Qualification Score) they select. The MQS for FITA rounds are 1200 (men) and 1180 (women). For 70m rounds they are 600 (men) and 590 (women). Athletes who wish to qualify for the Olympics need to achieve the MQS in the period starting from 5 July 2007 until 16 July 2008.\nHost nation China qualified 3 athletes per gender automatically when they participated with the same number of athletes at the 2007 World Outdoor Target Championships in Leipzig. At these championships another 80 spots were given to NOCs. The top 8 nations per gender (apart from China) in the team competition qualified with 3 athletes for the Olympics. Sixteen spots per gender were given to the NOCs with the highest ranked athletes who had not yet qualified through the team competition, with a maximum of 2 athletes per NOC.\nArchers can also qualify through Continental Qualification Tournaments. Archers who have already earned qualification spots for their NOC as well as nations that don't belong to the continental area may not participate in these Continental Championships. Three spots will be allocated to Asia, Europe and Pan America, while Africa and Oceania both receive 2 spots per gender. At these tournaments there is a maximum of 2 athletes per NOC.\nA special tournament called the Final World Qualification Tournament will be held between nations that not have won any quota places through other tournaments. They can qualify a maximum of one athlete per gender per NOC. This tournament will be held from 23 June 2008 until 29 June 2008. Three remaining spots per gender will be allocated by a commission of IOC and FITA members to nations who have submitted athletes but did not yet qualify.\nThe following is a list of qualification events:\nParticipating nations.\n128 archers from 49 nations took part.\nMedal summary.\nMedal table.\nRetrieved from Beijing Olympics 2008 Official Website."

At Drexel, he averaged over 19 points per game during his college basketball career, and led the Dragons to their first-ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearance in 1986, where they lost to eventual national champion, Louisville. This game was notable because Anderson was playing against familiar local foes, Milt Wagner and Billy Thompson, who played high school ball on Camden's nationally ranked team. That year Anderson was named to the UPI and Sporting News honorable mention All-America teams. Anderson also led the Dragons to an upset of a David Robinson-led Navy team in the Palestra in 1987, one of the biggest wins in school history.\nAnderson is ranked 12th all-time in career NCAA steals, with 341, and he is tied for second all-time in career NCAA triple doubles. He was recognized in 2008 by the Colonial Athletic Association as a CAA Men's Basketball Legend, in a class that included University of Maryland and James Madison University head coach Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell.\nProfessional career.\nAnderson would become the first Drexel basketball player to make the roster of an NBA team. He played for the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989 NBA season, after being drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the 3rd round (23rd pick), of the 1988 NBA draft.\nAnderson had a successful four-year career in the Spanish ACB League, playing from 1993 to 1997. He played for Real Madrid, Baloncesto León, CB Murcia and Caja San Fernando, garnering league MVP honors in the 1995–96 season, while playing for the latter. He was also a 1993 ACB league All-Star. After that, he played for Ülkerspor in Turkey, and with them he won the 1997–98 Turkish Basketball Super League season championship, while averaging 21.1 points per game. Anderson also played a couple years in the USBL and the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), making the All-Rookie team in 1988–89, with the Charleston Gunners, and making first team All-League with the Tri-City Chinook in 1993–94."

        "title": "Ice hockey stick",
        "text": "An ice hockey stick is a piece of equipment used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are approximately 150–200 cm long, composed of a long, slender shaft with a flat extension at one end called the blade. National Hockey League (NHL) sticks are up to 63 inches (160 cm) long. The blade is the part of the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40 cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135° angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the stick a partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but is slightly elastic to improve shot performance.\nThe blade is slightly curved to aid control of the puck, especially in shooting. The direction of the curve depends on the side of the body the player wields the stick on.\nThe goaltender has a slightly modified stick. The lower part of the stick is wider, the angle is smaller, and the blade is slightly curved towards the direction of the play. New goaltender sticks also are made of the same composite technology as used in regular sticks.\nHistory.\nThe oldest known hockey stick dates to the mid-1830s; it was made for William \"Dilly\" Moffatt (born 1829) from sugar maple wood and is now owned by the Canadian Museum of History. In 2006, a stick made in the 1850s, at the time the oldest known, was sold at auction for $2.2 million; it had been appraised at US$4.25 million.\nThe Moffatt stick may have been made by the Mi'kmaq. Starting in the 18th century, there are numerous references to the Mi'kmaq people of Nova Scotia playing ice hockey, and starting in the 19th century, there are claims that they invented the ice hockey stick. In the mid-19th century, the Starr Manufacturing Company began to sell Mic-Mac hockey sticks nationally and internationally. Through the first decade of the 20th century, it was the best-selling hockey stick in Canada. By 1903, apart from farming, producing them was the primary occupation of the Mi'kmaq on reserves throughout Nova Scotia, particularly Shubenacadie, Indian Brook and Millbrook. In 1927 the department of Indian Affairs for Nova Scotia identified that the Mi'kmaq remained the \"experts\" at making hockey sticks. Mi'kmaq continued to make hockey sticks until the 1930s.\nHockey sticks were mostly made from the maple or willow trees, which was also a common choice for golf club shafts and wooden tools. However, as hornbeam supplies diminished, it became more cost effective to use other hardwoods, such as yellow birch and ash. Ash gradually became the preferred medium, and by the 1920s an ash hockey stick crafted from a single piece of wood was the type most commonly used. These early sticks were extremely heavy and not very forgiving, although they were extremely durable (Hall of Famer Moose Johnson famously used the same extra-long stick, which gave him a reach, his entire career).\nThere were only a handful of major developments in hockey stick technology between the 1920s and the 2000s. Foremost among these was creation of the laminated stick in the 1940s, where layers of wood were glued together and sandwiched to create a more flexible and durable design. In the 1960s, companies began adding another lamination of fiberglass or other such synthetic compound as a coating, which further added to the durability and usability of the stick. Also in the 1960s, players began curving the blade of the stick, which dramatically changed the physics affecting players' shots.\nIn the 1970s, cricket and baseball bat manufacturers began experimenting with lightweight steel alloys as a replacement for the traditional willow or ash bat. Hockey stick designers followed suit in the early 1980s, introducing first a single piece all-aluminum stick. This design was not popular, as the stiff aluminum did not have the proper \"feel\", and so a design featuring an aluminum shaft and a removable, replaceable wooden blade was tried. This became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, challenging the prevalence of the traditional wooden stick for the first time.\nIn recent years, the aluminum stick, as well as its wooden counterpart, have largely been replaced by more advanced composite designs. Common building materials include fiberglass and carbon fiber. Composite sticks generally weigh less than their aluminum forebears, and they can be manufactured with more consistent (and varied) physical properties than their wooden counterparts. They are, however, considerably more expensive than wooden sticks, and are not as durable as the older aluminum sticks.\nMaterials.\nOver the last two decades, there have been tremendous advances in the material technology used to create hockey sticks. The vast majority of sticks are made with one or more of the following materials:\nCarbon fiber.\nCarbon fiber has become by far the most common building material for sticks used in the NHL. Carbon fiber sticks were originally sold as shafts alone, much like their aluminum counterparts but nowadays, most hockey sticks are \"one piece\" sticks. The first company to successfully develop, produce and market \"one piece\" carbon fiber composite sticks was Composite Busch SA out of Switzerland in 1992. \nCarbon fiber sticks are ideal due to their light weight and favorable mechanical characteristics. They are generally accepted to be able to store and release elastic potential energy predictably and efficiently. However, there is ongoing debate over whether the mechanical characteristics of composite sticks make for more powerful shots.\nCompared to other materials, carbon fiber sticks tend to break more easily and cost more.\nFiberglass.\nFiberglass was the first composite stick material, initially used with wood. Some sticks made solely from fiberglass have been produced but today, fiberglass is most commonly used as a composite with other materials, such as wood, carbon fiber, and/or kevlar.\nWood.\nWooden sticks are usually constructed by laminating multiple types of wood into a high quality plywood, then coating the stick and blade with thin plastic or fiberglass. Some manufacturers use fiberglass as a laminate between wood layers. Today in the NHL, almost no players still use wooden sticks.\nThe main advantage that wooden sticks enjoy today is their low cost. This makes them a popular choice for street hockey. Their main disadvantage that wooden sticks suffer from is their relative inconsistency. Wood has a tendency to warp, and over time its flex and stiffness properties will change. Additionally, being a natural material, wood also creates variations in production (even between identical patterns).\nAluminum.\nAluminum sticks were the first non-wood sticks to appear. Most aluminum sticks consist of a shaft made of an aluminum alloy and a wooden blade or composite blade, which is held in the shaft by glue and the compression of the shaft itself. There was a brief period in the 1990s when the majority of NHL players used aluminum sticks, but today nearly all players use composite sticks.\nThe main advantage aluminum sticks enjoy is their unparalleled durability. It is fairly rare for an aluminum shaft to be broken or damaged, even at the professional level, and since the blades can be easily replaced, a shaft will typically last for a relatively long period of time. Aluminum sticks will not suffer wear or warping like a wooden stick, and they can be manufactured with high consistency. Aluminum sticks, however, are not as elastic as other materials.\nProperties.\nLie.\nThe \"lie\" of a stick refers to the angle between the shaft and the blade. A lie value of 5 corresponds to a 135° angle, and each additional lie value corresponds to a 2° smaller angle. With the bottom of the blade flat on the ice, a higher lie value corresponds to a more upright shaft. Typical values range from 5 to 7; most sticks now are near 5.5. Goalie sticks typically have a lie between 11 and 15.\nPlayers usually seek a lie that will put the blade flat on the ice while they are in their typical skating stance. Hall of Fame center Wayne Gretzky, for example, used a stick with a low lie to correspond with his deep skating crouch and shorter height, whereas Hall of Fame defenceman Rod Langway used a stick with a very high lie number as he was very tall and tended to skate in a very upright position.\nStiffness.\nHockey stick shafts, much like golf club shafts, are highly flexible, and this flexibility is a key component in their performance. \"Flex\", \"bend\", \"stiffness\", and \"whip\" are all terms used to describe the amount of force required to bend a given stick shaft a certain amount.\nWith most composite and aluminum sticks, their stiffness characteristic is correlated numerically. This number, which ranges from 40 through 160, is printed on the stick and corresponds to the amount of force (in pounds-force) that it takes to deflect or bend the shaft one inch. For example, if is required to bend the shaft , it would be labelled \"100 stiff\". The stiff rating of a stick applies to its original length and increases if it is cut to a shorter length.\nStick stiffness is viewed as a very important characteristic by most players. Commonly, defencemen seek stiffer shafts, as their greater stiffness imparts more force on slap shots and improves stick-checking. Forwards will commonly seek more flexible shafts, as they require less force to bend and are thus better suited to create quick and accurate wrist shots, as well as improving passing and stickhandling.\nStiffness is also correlated to player strength; stronger players will often prefer stiffer flexes, as they have a sufficient amount of strength to fully bend (and thus maximize potential energy) using such shafts, whereas younger players and players with less strength will generally have more success using more flexible shafts which they are capable of bending to their optimal degree.\nBlade shape.\nUntil the early 1960s, hockey stick blades were typically not curved. However, in the late 1950s, New York Rangers center Andy Bathgate began experimenting with \"breaking\" his stick blades to impart a curve, which he found made his slap shots behave in highly erratic ways. Soon after Chicago Black Hawks forwards Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull stumbled onto the \"broken blade\", and subsequently began asking their stick manufacturers to create sticks with pre-curved blades.\nSoon after, much of the NHL, and Hull in particular, became a proponents of the \"banana blade\", or stick with extreme amounts (often up to ) of curve in the blade. These curves made slap shots behave very erratically, and in an era in which goalies did not wear masks, this eventually became an unacceptable danger. By 1967, the NHL began to limit the amount of curve a stick blade could legally have. In the NHL today, the legal limit is 19 mm, or of an inch.\nMuch like the shaft's flex, a blade's shape is a very important characteristic of a stick's performance. There are three primary variables in blade design: curve, face angle, and toe.\nThe curve refers to the basic amount the blade curves from toe to heel, as well as the part of the blade where that curve is located. A \"toe curve\" means that the curve is concentrated near the toe of the blade, and it is usually preferred by forwards, who seek better puckhandling and more accurate wrist shots. A \"heel curve\" is generally better for slap shots, and is thus used more by defencemen.\nFace angle is the angle between the ice surface and the front surface of the blade (this characteristic is comparable to the difference between the different irons in golf). A more \"open\" blade means that the face of the blade is turned up more sharply, and thus will cause a higher trajectory than a \"closed\" face angle.\nThe toe shape refers to the basic shape of the end of the blade, and it is typically either round or square. Square toes make it easier to pull a puck off the boards or to do \"toe drags\" (stickhandling moves using the toe of the blade), whereas round toes make it easier to \"flip\" the puck, and also offer slight advantages in basic puckhandling.\nBlades also differ in length and thickness, based on player preference.\nIllegal curves.\nThe curve of a blade is limited at most levels of competitive hockey, generally to an amount between . Hasty measurements can be made by attempting to roll a dime under the j\nblade placed face down on the ice, but accurate measurements require a \"stick gauge\" which measures curve precisely. Currently, the NHL limits blade curvature to . Being caught using an illegal stick is typically punished with a two-minute minor penalty.\nThe genesis for this rule was the \"banana blade\" of the 1960s. At the height of this era, players would often simply cross the blue line and let fly with a slap shot, hoping that the bizarre behavior of the puck would beat the goaltender. In this era, goaltenders were irritated by the danger such wild shots posed to them and in response, the NHL began gradually reducing the amount of curve a blade could legally have.\nIn the modern game, the emphasis on shooting accuracy has largely eliminated any preference for extreme blade curves. However, hockey still retains illegal stick rules, which has become a cause of debate. The argument is that since blade curvature does not impart any significant advantage, that penalizing it is unnecessary. Additionally, coaches have used the \"illegal equipment\" penalty at key moments in games to win a power play, and in some cases, swing the momentum of an entire series, including the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals.\nCurves/blades.\nHockey stick curves have gained in popularity since their inception. Curves range from strongly angled toe curves to slightly angled heel curves, affecting the feel of a hockey puck. Each hockey stick brand will identify the curves with a specific title. In addition, brands share curves to offer players similarities while using different sticks. The curve of the blade has a direct effect on your ability to shoot, pass and stickhandle. Changing your curve threatens your ability to hit the corners you're used to hitting, make the passes you're used to making and pull off the moves you're used to pulling off. \nAll Hockey stick curves have some degree of loft to them. This is similar to how golf wedges look, but to a much lesser extent. Hockey stick blades with a closed face will help keep shots low and powerful, with more straight-line velocity. Slightly open faces are slightly more open than the closed option, so it will still provide great power on heavy shots, while also give players an easier time lifting the puck on shots. Open faced blade types are, as the name states, the most open of the three. Blade patterns with open faces are great for getting the puck up in the air as quickly as possible in tight areas.\nMid curve.\nMid curves fall between toe curves and heel curves and in use are a balance of the two. Due to most of the curve being in the middle of the blade, Hockey sticks with these blade patterns are great for stickhandlers, passers, and accuracy on all types of shots, including backhand shots.\nToe curve.\nToe curves are blades that have most of their curve at the toe area of the blade. Hockey stick patterns that are listed as having toe curves are often preferred by forwards as they will allow them to lift the puck quicker and easier during shooting in tight spaces.\nHeel curve.\nHeel curves are blades that have more of a curve near the base (or Heel) of the blade. This means that the curve of the blade will start here with the middle and toe of the blade straightening out a little bit. Heel curves are predominantly used by defensemen as they help improve slap shot power and accuracy. \nBlade length.\nThere is no ‘standard' blade length (e.g., 8\" for a short blade and 9\" for a long blade). The maximum allowed under NHL rules is 12.5 inches from the heel to the end of the blade. There is no official minimum length.\nBlade length can vary greatly depending on the manufacturer—a ‘short' or ‘long' blade is a relative term and can vary between companies. The particular curve, or the qualities the pattern is designed to have—for example, better for shooting, for puck handling, for passing—will have an impact on the length of the blade.\nCurve names.\nP92 (Bauer), P29/P90 (CCM), W03 (Warrior), TC2 (True).\nOne of the most popular patterns in the game today. Provides great puck control, quick releases, great control on shots.\nP28 (Bauer), P28 (CCM), W28 (Warrior), TC4 (True).\nFastest growing pattern in hockey. Great for toe drags, quick releases, and getting lift on your shots.\nP88 (Bauer), P88/P80 (CCM), W88 (Warrior), MC (True).\nClassic mid-curve blade. Great all-around blade for stick-handling, wrist shots, and quick releases. Also good for backhand shots.\nPM9 (Bauer), P42 (CCM), W01 (Warrior), MC2 (True).\nGreat mid-curve option for players who take a wide variety of shots. Backhands, quick snap shots, and wrist shots. Perfect for high-velocity shots.\nAlso great for stickhandling in tight spaces."

        "text": "The United States national American football team often referred to as Team USA represents the United States in international men's Flag football and American football (Tackle Football) competitions. It is currently controlled by USA Football and is recognized by the International Federation of American Football (IFAF). The team is currently ranked no.1 in the world in both flag and tackle Football by the IFAF.\nTeam USA has won the IFAF World Championships three times (most recently in 2015) and has won the IFAF Flag Football World Championship five times (most recently in 2021); which are the most championships won by a country for both tournaments. In 2017, Team USA won a bronze medal at the World Games. In 2022, Team USA won a gold medal in Flag football at the World Games.\nDuring 2015, a split between IFAF Paris and IFAF New York occurred, in which IFAF Paris expelled USA Football in 2017. USA Football was temporary replaced by the United States Federation of American Football in Paris, while New York retained USA Football as their active member. The United States Federation of American Football would manage the 2017 national team at the World Games.\nIn March 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) determined that the IFAF New York was the proper governing entity and voided all decisions of the other IFAF entity, including their decision to strip USA Football of its recognition. USA Football is currently the internationally recognized sole governing body for American football in the United States.\nPlayer eligibility.\nThe national team was selected to encompass a cross-section of amateur football in the United States, and as such USA Football used strict criteria to select team members. This does not permit the top football players in the United States to compete. The criteria are applied to make international tournaments more competitive. The restrictions include:\nAn exception to these criteria however, applies to the Summer Olympic Games, as NFL executive Peter O'Reilly stated on October 17, 2023 that the National Football League will work with the players' union on allowing current and former NFL players to participate for Team USA in Flag football at the upcoming 2028 Summer Olympics.\nIFAF World Championship.\n2007.\nThe United States competed for the first time in the 2007 IFAF World Cup. The team's first ever game was a 77–0 win over South Korea in the first round of the tournament. Team USA defense set an IFAF all-time tournament record in holding South Korea to minus-31 yards in total offense, as well as the record for fewest rushing yards allowed with minus-47. In the second round the USA defeated Germany 33–7. They played Japan on July 15 for the championship. Japan was making their third appearance in the finals, winning the previous two World Championships. Japan took a 17–10 lead with seven minutes and seven seconds left in regulation. University of Arizona quarterback Adam Austin guided Team USA with an 11-play, 80-yard drive that ended with the second 5-yard touchdown run by RB Kyle Kasperbauer, to tie the game at 17. IFAF follows the overtime system used by the NCAA, and both teams scored field goals with their first possession. In the second overtime, Japan got the ball first but missed a 34-yard field goal attempt. Team USA then reached Japan's 6-yard line. On 4th and one, Craig Coffin kicked the game winning 22-yard field goal, with the final score at 23–20. University of Nebraska-Omaha running back Kyle Kasperbauer was named MVP of the game after scoring two touchdowns and running for 54 yards on 15 carries. Austin finished 12 of 25 for 109 yards, with no TD's, and one interception. Former Williams player Jon Drenckhahn was the top receiver, catching 5 passes for 40 yards.\nThe team included players representing all levels of college football, with 13 from NCAA Division I FBS, 12 from NCAA Division I FCS, 10 from NCAA Division II, 9 from NCAA Division III and 1 former NAIA player.\n2011.\nThe head coach of Team USA was Mel Tjeerdsma of Northwest Missouri State University, with Larry Kehres the offensive coordinator and Lou Tepper the defensive coordinator. Players on the team were announced on the official Team USA Facebook on April 28, 2011. On July 8, Team USA played its 1st game, defeating Australia 61–0. After beating Mexico 17-7 on July 11, the team qualified for its 2nd consecutive World Cup gold medal game. On July 16, USA defeated Canada 50–7 to claim its 2nd consecutive World Championship.\nThe United States routed Canada 50–7 in the gold medal game of the 2011 IFAF Senior World Championship. The 20,000 fans in attendance at Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, Austria, set a record for an IFAF Championship game. The game was never close, with Team USA leading 37–7 at halftime. Team USA dominated the rushing game, outgaining Canada 247–48, with four players scoring touchdowns on the ground. While Henry Harris led the way for the Americans on the ground, with 114 yards on 15 carries and a TD, Mount Union RB Nate Kmic was the only American to score two touchdowns on the day and was named tournament MVP. University of Colorado quarterback Cody Hawkins was 13 of 21 for 161 yards and 2 TD passes. Ricardo Lenhart (Otterbein) led the receivers, with 3 catches for 63 yards. The U.S. defense recorded four sacks, and Jordan Lake caught two interceptions.\n2015.\nThe U.S. Men's National Team was led by former Boise State and Colorado head football coach Dan Hawkins. Hawkins was 53–11 at Boise State from 2001–05, winning four consecutive Western Athletic Conference titles. His teams compiled a 31-game WAC winning streak, the longest in conference history. The U.S. Men's National Team includes athletes from 24 states.\nThe United States defeated Japan in the gold medal game by a score of 59-12. This marked Team USA's third straight IFAF Championship, which would beat out Japan for the most IFAF Championships.\nIFAF Flag Football World Championship.\n2008.\nAlthough the IFAF Flag Football Championship was founded in 2002, Team USA first competed in the 2008 edition of the tournament. The United States lost to France 45-0 in the bronze medal game, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.\n2010.\nIn the 2010 tournament, Team USA went undefeated in group play securing their way to the playoff round. The United States defeated Germany 33-0 in the quarterfinals and Canada 48-25 in the semifinals to reach the gold medal game. In the championship game, Team USA faced Denmark who they beat previously in group play. Quarterback Jorge Cascudo led the team to a 35-19 victory to capture the gold medal.\n2012.\nIn the 2012 tournament, Austria defeated the United States in the gold medal game by a close score of 47-40. Team USA finished the tournament with a silver medal.\n2014.\nIn the 2014 tournament, the United States reclaimed the gold medal defeating Mexico by a score of 40–14.\n2016.\nIn the 2016 tournament, The United States defeated Denmark 33–32, to win their second consecutive and third overall title. This was a rematch of the 2010 gold medal match, as Team USA narrowly escaped with another gold medal win over Denmark.\n2018.\nThe United States won its third consecutive, and fourth overall title at the 2018 tournament. Team USA went undefeated in pool play, before beating Israel in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the team defeated Denmark handily, jumping out to a 34-0 lead at one point against a team that they beat by only one point in pool play two days earlier. The team went on to defeat Austria in the championship by score of 19-13. In a rematch of the gold medal game in 2012 where Austria defeated the United States, quarterback Eric Holliday led Team USA to victory. The team's third consecutive championship was a first for any country in IFAF Flag World Championship history on either the men’s or women’s side.\n2021.\nThe worldwide pandemic forced the tournament to move from 2020 to 2021. Team USA won its fourth consecutive, and fifth overall gold medal, defeating Mexico 44-41 in the final game. The United States went a perfect 7-0 throughout the tournament. Quarterback Eric Holliday led Team USA to a comeback victory in the championship game as Mexico was winning the game by a score of 41-30 with 10 minutes left to play in the game.\n2024.\nTeam USA is set to defend their championship in the 2024 tournament.\nWorld Games.\n2017.\nDuring the 2015 split between IFAF Paris and IFAF New York, in which IFAF Paris expelled USA Football in 2017. USA Football was replaced by the United States Federation of American Football in Paris, while New York retained USA Football as their active member. Since IFAF New York was not recognized by the International Olympic Committee at the time, the United States Federation of American Football was permitted to organize the United States national American football team for the 2017 World Games.\nPlayers, mainly professional Americans playing in Europe, were chosen for the team on May 31, 2017. Players were promised full funding from the United States Federation of American Football, however, the funding was withdrawn just days before the competition and players had to provide their own transportation to Wroclaw. As a result, most of the team withdrew from the competition and were instead replaced by volunteers who were already in Europe at the time. Most of the team arrived the day before their opening match vs the Germany national American football team. The Americans lost to Germany 13–14, in which was the first loss ever for a United States national American football team in international competition. \nThe United States were able to rebound two days later and defeat the Poland national American football team 14-7 en route to a bronze medal at the 2017 World Games.\n2022.\nOn July 20, 2020, the International World Games Association (IWGA), National Football League (NFL), and International Federation of American Football (IFAF) announced that flag football would join the existing lineup of 32 unique, multi-disciplinary sports for the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama. The 2022 World Games, which marked the 40th anniversary of the event, took place from July 7–17, 2022, and was hosted at Birmingham's historic Legion Field\nTeam USA qualified as hosts of the tournament. With a roster including former NFL player Dezmin Lewis, the team went a perfect 3-0 in pool play, with a score differential of +71. Team USA would go on to play Germany in the Quarterfinals, and Austria in the Semifinals, defeating both teams. Team USA would go on to defeat Italy in the final game by a score of 46-36 to capture the gold medal.\nFlag Football at the Summer Olympics.\nOn October 16, 2023 the NFL and IFAF announced the approval of flag football as an official sport in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. This will mark the first time that American football in any form will be featured in the Olympics since it was a demonstration sport in 1904 and 1932. Team USA will automatically qualify for the tournament as the host country.\nOn October 17, 2023 NFL executive Peter O'Reilly said the league will work with the players' union on allowing current and former players to participate in the 2028 Summer Olympics."

        "text": "Table tennis is among the sports contested at the Summer Olympic Games. It was introduced at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where singles and doubles tournaments were held for both genders. The doubles events were dropped from the 2008 Summer Olympics program and replaced by team events. The competitions are conducted in accordance with the rules established by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).\nMa Long (China) is the all-time Olympic medal leader, having won five golds. Dimitrij Ovtcharov (Germany) have won six medals in the men's competitions, while Ma Lin and Zhang Jike (China) are the male with three gold medals. Wang Nan (China) is the best-performing athlete in the women's competitions, having won four golds—a figure shared with fellow Chinese players Deng Yaping and Zhang Yining—and one silver medal. Thirteen players have won four medals and six have won three. Chen Jing competed for China when she won her first two medals in 1988, and for Chinese Taipei when she gained her most recent two medals at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics. Since 1992, the winner of the women's singles has also won the doubles or team event: Deng Yaping, in 1992 and 1996; Wang Nan, in 2000; Zhang Yining, in 2004 and 2008; Li Xiaoxia, in 2012; Ding Ning, in 2016; and Chen Meng, in 2020. In the men's competition, Liu Guoliang (1996), Ma Lin (2008), Zhang Jike (2012), and Ma Long (2016 and 2020) have achieved this feat. Besides Deng, Zhang and Ma Long, no other female or male player has successfully defended their singles title, while in the doubles, back-to-back victories were achieved by Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong (1992, 1996), and Wang Nan (with Li Ju in 2000, and Zhang Yining in 2004).\nChina has been the most successful nation in Olympic table tennis, winning 60 medals (36 gold, 23 silver, and 8 bronze). Since 1992, Chinese players have won at least one medal in every event. At the 2008 Games, China achieved an unprecedented medal sweep in both the men's and women's singles tournaments, and won both team tournaments. With 18 medals, South Korea is second to China in the overall medal count, and is the only other nation to have won double-digit medals. As of the 2020 Summer Olympics, 115 medals (37 gold, 37 silver, and 41 bronze) have been awarded to 102 players selected from 12 National Olympic Committees (NOC). Third-place matches were not held at the 1992 Summer Olympics, so all losing semifinalists were given bronze medals, resulting in four additional bronze medalists.\nStatistics.\nAthlete medal leaders.\n The years indicate the Olympics at which the medals were won.\nPodium sweeps.\nThere has been three podium sweeps in Olympic table tennis history. This is when athletes from one NOC win all three medals in a single event. This has not been possible since the conclusion of the 2008 Olympic games, since following China's podium sweeps, the ITTF has limited each country at the Olympics to a maximum of two contestants per gender."

        "title": "American Football Coaches Association",
        "text": "The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) is an association of over 11,000 American football coaches and staff on all levels. According to its constitution, some of the main goals of the American Football Coaches Association are to \"maintain the highest possible standards in football and the profession of coaching football,\" and to \"provide a forum for the discussion and study of all matters pertaining to football and coaching.\" The AFCA, along with \"USA Today\", is responsible for the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision Coaches Poll. The AFCA is also responsible for the Top 25 poll for Division II and Division III football.\nThe AFCA was founded in a meeting for 43 coaches at the Hotel Astor in New York City on Dec. 27, 1921. It is headquartered in Waco, Texas (the headquarters building is located across from Baylor University, formerly coached by AFCA executive director Grant Teaff).\nThe association has over 10,000 members and represents coaches at all levels including the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, the National Junior College Athletic Association, the National Federation of State High School Associations, the National Football League, the Canadian Football League, USA Football, the National Football Foundation, College Football Hall of Fame, and Pop Warner Football. The AFCA is considered the primary professional association for football coaches at all levels of competition.\nAnother primary goal of the American Football Coaches Association is the promotion of safety. The association has established a code of ethics and has made many safety recommendations. An annual injury survey begun by the AFCA in the 1930s has provided valuable data and has led to a remarkable reduction of injuries in the sport down through the years. The NCAA Rules Committee often follows recommendations made by the AFCA.\nAll-American Teams.\nSince 1945, the American Football Coaches Association has selected an All-American team. It is the only one selected exclusively by the coaches themselves.\nAFCA National Championship Trophy.\nThe AFCA National Championship Trophy is the trophy awarded by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) to the winner of college football's Coaches Poll. From 1992 to 2013 the trophy was contractually obligated to be awarded to the winner of the Bowl Coalition (1992-1994), Bowl Alliance (1995-1997), and Bowl Championship Series (1998-2013) national championship game winner. The trophy has been awarded since 1986 but teams that won the Coaches Poll from earlier seasons can purchase replicas for those years.\nAmos Alonzo Stagg Award.\nSince 1940, the AFCA has awarded the annual Amos Alonzo Stagg Award to the \"individual, group or institution whose services have been outstanding in the advancement of the best interests of football.\"\nTuss McLaughry Award.\nThe Tuss McLaughry Award, established in 1964, is given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others. It is named in honor of DeOrmond \"Tuss\" McLaughry, the first full-time secretary-treasurer of the AFCA and one of the most dedicated and influential members in the history of the association.\nTuss McLaughry, the award's namesake, began his coaching career at his alma mater, Westminster (Pa.) College in 1916. During his early days in coaching, McLaughry spent his spare time playing pro football with the Massillon (Ohio) Tigers. Knute Rockne was a teammate. He went on to become head coach at Amherst (1922–25), Brown (1926–40), and Dartmouth (1941–55). McLaughry retired from coaching in 1954, but continued in his capacity as chairman of the Physical Education Department at Dartmouth until 1960, when he accepted the appointment with the AFCA. He retired from that position in 1965.\nPresidents.\nMaj. Charles Daly of the U.S. Military Academy was the first president of the American Football Coaches Association. He was followed by John Heisman. Other presidents have included Bear Bryant, Darrell Royal, Eddie Robinson, Charles McClendon, Bo Schembechler, Vince Dooley, and Bill Cronin"

        "title": "Skeleton Key (novel)",
        "text": "Skeleton Key is the third book in the \"Alex Rider\" series written by British author Anthony Horowitz. The book was released in the United Kingdom on July 8, 2002, and in the United States on April 28, 2003.\nSummary.\nOn the fictional island of Skeleton Key, off the coast of Cuba, three men supply General Alexei Sarov with uranium. In the process they tell him to give them a quarter of a million more dollars, otherwise they will go to the American authorities. Feeling threatened, General Sarov switches off the runway lights when the plane is about to take off and turns on another set of lights that cause them to fall into crocodile-infested waters.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that the \"real\" Alex Rider survived the fight with his clone. MI6 Chief of Staff John Crawley offers Alex tickets to Wimbledon, where he goes undercover as a ball boy to investigate a break-in. Alex is targeted by the Chinese Triad gang Big Circle after he foiled an attempt at match-fixing by them. After two attempts on his life are made, both MI6 and the CIA arrange to send Alex away for his own safety. He is partnered with CIA agents Tom Turner and Belinda Troy and sent to Skeleton Key to investigate Sarov.\nThe CIA is concerned about the actions of Sarov and his upcoming meeting with Russian president Boris Kiriyenko (a childhood friend of Sarov's). En route to Skeleton Key, the \"family\" of Alex, Turner, and Troy stop in Miami. Much to Alex's frustration, Turner and Troy are unhappy about bringing Alex and attempt to withhold as much information from him as possible. Turner meets a criminal known as \"the Salesman\" on a yacht, the \"Mayfair Lady\", correctly suspecting that the latter was involved in the sale of uranium to Sarov. The Salesman, however, is aware of Turner's \"true\" identity and plans to kill him. Alex sneaks aboard the boat and causes a distraction by setting fire to it. Using a drugged dart, Alex knocks out the Salesman. While both Alex and Turner escape by jumping into the sea, the \"Mayfair Lady\" tries to run them down, but explodes, killing everyone on board. Turner blames Alex for causing the explosion, but Alex insists he was not responsible.\nIn Skeleton Key, Alex notices a Geiger counter in a Game Boy Advance console he was given by his \"parents\", deducing that Turner and Troy were sent to the island to search for a nuclear bomb. Turner and Troy reluctantly reveal their suspicions and their plan to infiltrate Sarov's residence – the Casa de Oro - by scuba diving into a cave underneath that features a ladder formerly used by smugglers that leads to the grounds. Alex goes with them but stays on the boat while Turner and Troy go underwater. When they do not return after a while, Alex dives in and, after an encounter with a shark, discovers a hidden mechanical spear trap that impaled Turner and Troy, which kills the shark as well. When he resurfaces, Alex is captured by Conrad, Sarov's right-hand man, who drugs him. Alex reluctantly tells the truth when interrogated by Conrad, who decides to kill him by feeding him into two grindstones in a sugar mill. Sarov stops Conrad, and Alex passes out.\nAlex wakes up in the Casa de Oro and meets with Sarov, who reveals that \"Conrad\" planted an explosive on the \"Mayfair Lady\" to prevent the Salesman alerting the authorities. The next day, Sarov reveals his son Vladamir died in Afghanistan. Sarov plans to adopt Alex, whose physical appearance and personality are similar to Vladamir's. He has Alex hidden in a former slave house when President Kiriyenko arrives. Alex attempts to escape the mansion by hiding in the boot of a car, but is caught by Sarov using a heartbeat detector. The general spares Alex's life again, but punishes him through psychological torture. At dinner, Sarov drugs Kiryenko and has him and his retinue imprisoned, before taking Alex, Conrad, the nuclear warhead and his security detail on Kiryenko's private plane to Murmansk, Russia, which contains a shipyard of decommissioned nuclear submarines.\nSarov plans to detonate the warhead in the shipyard to make appear as if a \"submarine\" exploded. With Europe rendered uninhabitable by the resulting nuclear fallout and Russia blamed for the disaster, doctored footage will be released to discredit Kiriyenko, ousting him from power while reverting Russia back to communism under Sarov. Sarov will then instigate wars until the entire world is under a communist government and plans for Alex to take over years later. When the plane makes a fuel stop in Edinburgh, Alex uses a stun grenade disguised as a keyring to escape, temporarily incapacitating Sarov and Conrad. Alex attempts to call the police but is stopped by George Prescott, a security guard. Sarov later recaptures Alex and Conrad kills the guard. The plane then lands in Russia, where Sarov reunites with soldiers who fought under him and are all loyal to his goal of worldwide communism.\nAt Murmansk, Conrad plants the bomb on a submarine using a crane. Alex is handcuffed to a handrail. For his betrayal, Sarov plans for him to die in the explosion. After Sarov departs for Moscow, Alex sets himself free. Alex fights with Conrad, who had decided to disobey the general and kill Alex himself. The Russian army and navy arrive and initiate a firefight against Sarov's men. When Alex explained his predicament to Prescott, his office heard their conversation through the latter's radio. They notified MI6, who in turn warned the Russians. Despite outmatching Alex, Conrad (who has numerous pieces of metal inside his body following a failed bombing years earlier) is caught by a crane's electromagnet, pulling him with extreme force. This breaks his neck. Alex takes control of the crane, dropping Conrad's body into the sea and removing the nuclear bomb from the submarine. He then removes the detonation card, only to be told to put it back at gunpoint by a Sarov, who now plans to override the bomb, detonating it and killing everyone at the shipyard but still setting his plan in motion. Alex instead throws the card into the ocean and rejects becoming Sarov's son. Unable to live with himself anymore, and to avoid being put on trial, Sarov kills himself in front of Alex.\nAlex is depressed after his harrowing adventure. However, Sabina Pleasure, whom he befriended at Wimbledon, later invites Alex on holiday with her family in France for some weeks, cheering him up.\nGraphic novel.\nIn 2009 a graphic novel adaptation of \"Skeleton Key\" was released through Walker Books. This version altered some elements from the original novel, such as eliminating the attack on Alex while he was surfing in Cornwall, as well as having Sabina, already friends with Alex, attending Wimbledon as a spectator.\nReception.\nCritical reception for both versions of \"Skeleton Key\" was mostly positive, with Booklist giving the novel version a positive review. The print version of \"Skeleton Key\" was named as one of ALA's \"Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers\" for 2004. The School Library Journal has given praise for both editions of the story, calling the print version \"rip-roaring\" while recommending the graphic novel as a pick for \"reluctant readers\"."

        "text": "Mario Gosselin (born June 15, 1963) is a Canadian former hockey goaltender who played nine years in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Quebec Nordiques, the Los Angeles Kings and the Hartford Whalers.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Gosselin played in the 1975 and 1976 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Thetford Mines.\nGosselin played his junior hockey for the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL from 1980–1981 to 1982–1983. He was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques with 55th pick (third round) of the 1982 NHL Entry Draft.\nHe then represented Canada at the 1983 World Junior Championships as a spare goalie than continued to play for Canada joining the national team for the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics where he played seven games winning four of them and helping Canada finish fourth.\nQuebec Nordiques.\nFollowing the Games, he joined the Nordiques making a memorable debut on February 26, 1984, by blanking the St. Louis Blues 5–0.\nThe following year he formed a tandem with veteran Dan Bouchard and took over the starting job for good by playoff time helping backstop the Nordiques past the Buffalo Sabres in the first round and their fierce rivals the Montreal Canadiens in the second round before falling to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Semi-Finals.\nThe 1985-86 season had highs and lows for Gosselin. He battled for ice time with newcomer Clint Malarchuk and veteran Richard Sevigny and played well enough to be selected to play in the 1986 All-Star Game, but also struggled enough to spend five games in the American Hockey League with the Fredericton Express. His season ended on a high note, however, when Gosselin excelled for the Nordiques in the post-season going 7-4 after taking over the crease from Malarchuk.\nHe spent the next season in a back-up role but returned to the starting job in 1987-88 after Malarchuk was traded to the Washington Capitals. Gosselin and the Nordiques had a forgettable season and the following year, with veteran Bob Mason signed and rookie Ron Tugnutt pushing for starts Gosselin saw his playing time cut and again had a brief stint in the AHL. After the season, the Nordiques didn't renew his contract on June 6, 1989, and he signed with the Los Angeles Kings.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nGosselin served as the back-up to Kelly Hrudey but was largely ineffective posting a 7-11-1 record with a 3.87 goals against average. He did manage to get in the history books during his time with the Kings, even if it was for dubious reasons. Mario Gosselin was the first goaltender in NHL history to lose a game without giving up a goal. Gosselin filled in for Kelly Hrudey and the Kings would give up an empty net goal. The result was a 7–6 loss to the Edmonton Oilers.\nWhen the Kings acquired netminder Daniel Berthiaume the following off-season, Gosselin lost his job and spent the 1990-91 season as the starting goalie with the Kings International Hockey League affiliate in Phoenix.\nHartford Whalers.\nIn 1991-92, he signed with the Hartford Whalers but failed to return to the NHL that year and ended up spending his second consecutive season at the minor league level playing for the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League. During training camp before the 1992-93 campaign, Gosselin suffered a serious back injury that cost him four months. The injury was so serious, Gosselin feared his career might have been over. \"At a certain point in December, they told me maybe I would never play again. All I wanted to do was play hockey again.\" He worked his way back into the Springfield lineup but an injury to Whaler back-up Frank Pietrangelo brought him back to the NHL after nearly three years away. Shortly after, starter Sean Burke suffered back spasms and suddenly Gosselin was an NHL starter again. In 16 games with the Whalers that year he posted better numbers than incumbents Burke and Pietrangelo and impressed the Whaler brass enough to earn a new two year contract that March. The following season, he played 2 games in Springfield and 7 in Hartford before suffering a knee injury on November 27, 1993, in a game against the Florida Panthers that ultimately ended his season and career.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retirement, Gosselin worked as a radio analyst for the Roadrunners games and hockey coordinator at the YMCA before moving back to the province of Quebec in 1997. He now lives in Saint-Basile-le-grand with his wife, three sons (Francis, Yanick, Justin) and daughter Marylee. Gosselin owns a hockey school called \"Ecole de Hockey Mario Gosselin\" and works at various high schools as a goaltender coach for their ice hockey programs."

        "text": "Ian John Walsh (20 March 1933 – 4 April 2013) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer and coach. He was a with the St. George Dragons from 1962 to 1967 and played in the last five of the Dragons' historic 11 consecutive premiership winning teams. He captained St. George in the last of its 11 successive Grand Final wins in 1966 and led The Saints again when their premiership winning streak ended in 1967. He was a representative for Australia and captained them in 10 Test matches from 1963 to 1966.\nBiography.\nBorn on 20 March 1933 in Bogan Gate near Parkes in western New South Wales, Walsh played in country sides at Parkes, Forbes and Eugowra. He was selected to represent the Western Division when they hosted the 1951 French touring side and lost. It was as a country representative that his international début was against New Zealand in 1959, and later that year was selected for the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour. He played in all six Tests and in 17 minor tour matches.\nSt. George Dragons.\nWalsh joined St. George Dragons in 1962 and played ninety-six games till 1967, playing in four winning Grand Finals (1962, 1963, 1965 and 1966). His first Test as captain was on the 1963 Tour of Great Britain which saw the Kangaroos become the first Australian touring team in 50 years to win the Ashes. He was captain for the \"Swinton Massacre\" 2nd test of that tour when the Kangaroos registered the biggest win in Anglo-Australian test history, 50–12. After the retirement of Norm Provan in 1965, Walsh took on the role of St. George's captain-coach. In 1966 he achieved a rare distinction becoming the only player to captain-coach Australia to an Ashes series victory and his club to a premiership. He played a total of twenty-five tests for Australia from 1959 to 1966. The Dragons' star players were growing old, the young and brutal South Sydney Rabbitohs were looming as title contenders and the inevitable end to the run had to be approaching. Nevertheless, Walsh was able to lead the Dragons against the Balmain Tigers to their 11th straight victory and the end of their run.\nPost playing and accolades.\nAfter retiring as a player Walsh coached the Parramatta Eels to the semi-finals of the 1971 NSWRFL season before becoming a successful columnist with the \"Daily Telegraph\" for over 20 years and a Country and State selector. He worked in sales in the printing industry in Sydney.\nIn February 2008, Walsh was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nWalsh died on 4 April 2013 at the age of 80 after a long illness 14 days after his 80th birthday.\nOn 20 July 2022, Walsh was named in the St. George Dragons District Rugby League Clubs team of the century.\nFootnotes.\n "

        "text": "Frank Thomas Duffy (born October 14, 1946) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from through for the Cincinnati Reds, San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox.\nA 1964 graduate of Turlock High School who also starred in basketball and football, Duffy was inducted into the school's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997.\nDuffy is probably most remembered for being a part of what is considered a lopsided trade between the Reds and Giants. On May 29, 1971, Duffy was traded along with pitcher Vern Geishert for young outfielder George Foster. Geishert, who had played briefly in the majors in 1969, never played in the majors again, while Foster developed into a feared slugger and an important cog in \"The Big Red Machine\", the Reds' dynastic team of the first half of the 1970s.\nLater that same year, Duffy was part of a second trade that is almost as infamous. On November 29, exactly seven months after the previous trade, Duffy was traded with pitcher Gaylord Perry to the Indians, with the Giants receiving pitcher Sam McDowell. In this case, Duffy was on the other side of the lopsided deal, as he went on to be the Indians' starting shortstop for several years, leading the league in fielding percentage for shortstops in 1973, and placing in the top 5 for that same stat for his first 5 years in Cleveland. Perry went on to win 20 games three times, receive two Cy Young Awards, and eventually earn a place in the Hall of Fame, while McDowell pitched for four seasons, winning 10 games in 1972 but only 9 in the next three seasons combined.\nDuffy was dealt to the Red Sox for Rick Kreuger on March 23, 1978. He became expendable after his unexpected re-signing just before the start of spring training created a glut of shortstops for the Indians who had acquired Tom Veryzer and Dave Rosello during the off-season. His time in Boston was most noted for his quote \"The team gets off a plane and twenty-five players go off in twenty-five different cabs,\" an indictment of his teammates' egocentric discord that resulted in their inability to cope with adversity during the Red Sox's 1978 American League East pennant race collapse. Duffy appeared in only 70 games with the Red Sox who released him on May 22, 1979.\nDuffy retired and is a resident of Tucson, Arizona."

Crane has also played internationally for England.\nCrane is renowned for his impressive physique and powerful runs from the base of the scrum. He consistently ranks as one of the most frequent carriers of the ball in English club rugby.\nHe switched to playing rugby union relatively late after playing football for a number of professional clubs' junior sides.\nClub career.\nCrane made his debut for his former club, Leeds Tykes, in the nine-all draw at FC Grenoble in the European Challenge Cup in October 2004 aged just 18. He went on to make 29 appearances for the Tykes in all competitions scoring five tries, including a hat trick against Valladolid RAC in the European Challenge Cup.\nAfter Leeds were relegated in the 2005–06 season, Crane left the club to sign for the Leicester Tigers.\nIn the Heineken Cup semi-final match against Cardiff Blues on 3 May 2009, Crane scored the winning kick in the penalty shootout after the game had finished level after extra time. It was the first time a Heineken Cup tie had been decided in a shootout. Crane started in the subsequent 2009 Heineken Cup Final. Crane scored the only try in the final of the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership as Leicester defeated London Irish. He also started as Leicester won the 2010 and 2013 Premiership finals. Crane spent the whole of the 2011–12 Aviva Premiership campaign injured.\nAfter 10 years playing with Leicester, Crane announced his signing with Bristol Bears on a three-year contract from the 2016–17 season.\nInternational career.\nCrane made his U21 debut in February 2006 scoring a try against Wales at Worcester, and he was an ever-present in their successful U21 Grand Slam campaign. This was his second successive age group Grand Slam, as he had captained England's U19 side to success the season before. Crane has also captained England at U18 level and took over the leadership role when his new teammate, Matt Cornwell, was injured during the 2006 IRB U21 World Cup in France, fulfilling the promise shown when competing for Colston's School in the final of the Daily Mail U18 Cup competition at Twickenham.\nCrane was selected in the England Saxons squad for the 2006–07 season, and went on to compete at the 2007 Churchill Cup. Crane also played in the 2008 Churchill Cup, winning the tournament's Most Valuable Player award.\nOn 1 June 2008 he was named in Martin Johnson's Elite Player Squad and made his debut as a replacement against .

Fletcher is related to Michael Barrett, who also played for the Chicago Cubs. Fletcher graduated from Wadsworth High School in Wadsworth, Ohio, in 1976.\nPlaying career.\nFletcher was signed by the Chicago Cubs in the 1979 amateur draft and made his major league debut with the team in 1981. After two years in a limited role, the Cubs traded Fletcher to their intercity rival, the Chicago White Sox in 1983. With the emergence of Ozzie Guillén in 1985, Fletcher was traded to the Texas Rangers at the end of the 1985 season. In he hit .300 (15th best in the American League) for the Rangers and was named the American League Player of the Month for July. In 1988, Fletcher became the first professional athlete in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to earn more than $1 million a year. After a slow start to the 1989 season, which saw him bat only .239 through 83 games, Fletcher was traded back to the Chicago White Sox at the trade deadline. Fletcher would split the remaining seasons of his career with the White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers. He retired in 1995.\nWhen reflecting on Fletcher's playing career, Bill James noted that Fletcher \"didn't do anything exceptionally well\" and that he mainly \"filled a slot\", though he ranked him the 85th best shortstop of all time.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring in 1995, Fletcher became the manager for the minor league Charleston RiverDogs in 1997. He later became an assistant coach at Emory University from 1999 to 2004. Fletcher became the Colorado Rockies' infield coordinator in 2009. He was hired as an assistant hitting coach to Greg Walker on October 21, 2011. Fletcher left the Braves at the end of the 2014 season. Scott is currently a minor league instructor for the Detroit Tigers.\nLegacy.\nGeorge W. Bush named his dog Spot Fetcher after Fletcher while Bush was the owner of the Texas Rangers. The dog, an English Springer Spaniel, remained with the Bushes throughout George W. Bush's term as Governor of Texas (1995–2000) but died in 2004 during Bush's first term as US President."

        "text": "Kenyatta Cornelius Lucas (born January 23, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels. In 2004 he was the NFC co-leader in interceptions.\nLucas has also played for the Carolina Panthers.\nEarly years.\nLucas attended East Side High School in Cleveland, Mississippi, where he garnered first-team all-district honors at wide receiver and kick returner and all-county recognition at wide receiver and cornerback playing alongside former Seattle Seahawks offensive lineman Floyd \"Pork Chop\" Womack. He was selected the district rookie of the year as a freshman and named the team's most outstanding player as a junior and most valuable player as a senior. Lucas also lettered four times in baseball, finishing with a .395 career batting average. He graduated from East Side in 1997.\nCollege career.\nLucas began playing at the University of Mississippi as a wide receiver before moving to defensive back late in his sophomore season. He finished his college career with 87 tackles, seven interceptions and 33 passes defensed on defense; in addition, he totaled 23 catches for 292 yards and one touchdown and four carries for 73 yards on offense. Lucas returned 20 kickoffs for 383 yards and one punt for 17 yards, had nine tackles and blocked two punts on special teams.\nProfessional career.\nFirst stint with Seahawks.\nLucas was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. He started in his first game as a rookie against the Cleveland Browns, managing to deflect a crucial late game pass that allowed Seattle to preserve their lead and win the game. Lucas would go on to continue his defensive prowess by recording his first NFL interception against the esteemed San Diego Chargers' quarterback, Doug Flutie.\nDuring the 2002 NFL season, Lucas earned nationwide attention after recording two interceptions against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, earning him the NFL's \"NFC Defensive Player of the Week\" award. After an impressive display of athletic ability, Lucas finished the season with a career-high 82 tackles.\nDuring the 2004 NFL season, Lucas again earned the title of \"NFC Defensive Player of the Week\" after recording two interceptions against St. Louis Rams' quarterback Marc Bulger. He would finish the season with six interceptions, including one which was returned for his first NFL touchdown.\nCarolina Panthers.\nLucas was signed by the Panthers prior to the 2005 NFL season as an unrestricted free agent. He started fifteen games in his first season with the Panthers, and once more closed the season with six interceptions. Lucas would continue his superb work in the playoffs, recording two interceptions in three games, although he ended that season with a loss in the NFC Championship against his old team, the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks. During training camp for the 2008 season, Lucas was involved in an altercation with Panthers star receiver Steve Smith. Smith blackened Lucas' eye and broke his nose during the scuffle. Ken Lucas was praised by numerous people for forgiving Smith completely.\nLucas was released by the Panthers on March 11, 2009 to clear about $2.3 million in salary cap space.\nSecond stint with Seahawks.\nAfter four seasons in Carolina, Lucas re-signed with the Seattle Seahawks on April 27, 2009."

        "title": "1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase",
        "text": "During Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1998 season, Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs pursued the league's long-standing and highly coveted single-season home run record (61), set in 1961 by Roger Maris. The season-long chase culminated on September 8, 1998, when McGwire, facing Sosa and the Cubs, hit his 62nd home run of the season to break the record. McGwire finished the season with 70 home runs, while Sosa finished with 66. The 1998 home run record chase, as well the previous's year pursuit of the record, was widely credited by sports analysts with restoring interest in MLB among its fan base following the 1994 strike that resulted in that season prematurely ending and the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. McGwire's record was later broken in 2001 by Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs.\nSeveral players had come close to breaking Maris's record in the years before 1998. Before the 1994 season was cut short, Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants and Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners were both on a pace which threatened Maris's record: they hit 43 and 40 home runs respectively in a season which was shortened by approximately 50 of the scheduled 162 games. In 1995, Albert Belle became the first player since Cecil Fielder in 1990 to hit 50 home runs in a season. Belle was only the 4th player in the previous three decades to reach the 50 home run milestone (George Foster hit 52 in 1977, following Willie Mays in 1965). In 1996, Brady Anderson of the Baltimore Orioles hit 50 home runs, twice the number he hit during any other season. Of more note was McGwire of the Oakland Athletics, who first drew attention by hitting a league-leading 52 home runs that season while only playing in 130 games.\nThe 1997 home run chase featured McGwire and Griffey, but neither reached it that year. It was during that season that full-fledged interest over the record kicked in as both players were on record pace well into the summer. McGwire finished the 1997 season with 58 home runs following his mid-season trade to the Cardinals, besting Griffey's total of 56 that year.\nBreaking the record.\nSpeculation on the potential of McGwire or Griffey breaking Roger Maris' home run record was a popular story heading into spring training, and was even promoted by MLB, in an effort to draw fans back to the game who felt disenfranchised by the 1994 strike that prematurely ended the season and led to the cancellation of the World Series. With the spotlight still on Griffey and McGwire (entering his first full season as a Cardinal), the latter opened the 1998 season by hitting home runs in each of his first four games. McGwire would ultimately find himself ahead of record pace for all but two games of the season; his pace hit a low of 58.9 on May 7 following a five-game drought. After hitting 16 home runs in May (only two short of Rudy York's ill-fated record of 18 home runs in August 1937), McGwire led the league with 27 home runs, ahead of Griffey's 19 and on pace for more than 80.\nJune, however, would be Sosa's month to catch up. His 13 home runs entering the month represented less than half of rival McGwire's total. Sosa had his first of four multi-home run games that month on June 1, and went on to break Rudy York's record with 20 home runs in the month of June, a record that still stands. By the end of his historic month, the outfielder's 33 home runs tied him with Griffey and left him only four behind McGwire's 37.\nThe three remained competitive entering August, a period which saw McGwire go on a season-high eight-game home run drought. After hitting a home run on August 8, McGwire's lead had dwindled to two, his 46 home runs just above Sosa's 44 and Griffey's 41. His relative lull in production continued, hitting only three home runs over the next ten days. His pace at the end of August 18, 61.9 would be his lowest for the rest of the season. On August 19, he returned to form, hitting two home runs and beginning the stretch that would see him hit 23 home runs in his final 39 games. Sosa, meanwhile, had followed up his 20 home runs in June with a combined total of only 22 for July and August. At the end of the month, however, the two sluggers were locked at 55 home runs, putting them on pace for about 65 in total and, for the first time in 37 years, leaving the single-season home run record in imminent jeopardy. They were also each one short of Hack Wilson's National League record. By this point, Griffey's total of 47 home runs left him well behind the pace of his two rivals, indicating that even in the event he could pass Maris's total, it would be unlikely that he would also be able to beat McGwire and Sosa. Griffey would finish the season with 56 home runs, matching his total from the previous season but still 5 home runs short of Maris' record.\nMcGwire began September with four home runs in his first two games against the Florida Marlins and took back the lead, 59–56. His September 5 home run set the stage for one of baseball's classic moments, as he sat on 60 home runs entering a two-game set against Sosa's Chicago Cubs. On September 7, McGwire hit a Mike Morgan pitch 430 feet to become the first player since 1961 to hit 61 home runs in a season. The next day, September 8, 1998, in a nationally-televised game against Sosa's Cubs and with members of the Maris family in attendance, he hit Steve Trachsel's pitch 341 feet – his shortest home run of the season – just over the left field wall, breaking the record for the most home runs ever hit in a single season. The ball did not even make it to the stands, and was caught by Tim Forneris, who worked as a member of the Busch Stadium grounds crew while attending law school at Saint Louis University. Forneris declined multiple million-dollar offers to sell the ball and instead gave it to McGwire. In what was a show of both admiration as well as respect, Mark Grace, the Cubs first baseman shared a half-hug high five as McGwire rounded first, and after he touched home, Sosa charged in from right field and engaged McGwire in a celebratory embrace.\nAfterwards, however, McGwire went six consecutive games without a home run, allowing Sosa to tie him again at 62 after hitting four home runs in three games against the Milwaukee Brewers. The two battled back and forth for the lead, and entering the final series of the season on September 25, were tied at 65 home runs. Sosa hit a 462-foot home run off Houston Astros pitcher José Lima for his 66th home run of the season. McGwire, however, would hit five home runs against five different pitchers during a Cardinals homestand against the Montreal Expos, and would set the single-season MLB home run record at 70 with a 370-foot home run off Carl Pavano.\nThroughout the season, Sosa gave a \"V\" sign after every home run, dedicating it to the memory of Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, who died that February.\nAftermath.\nThe Cardinals, despite McGwire's efforts, finished the season 83–79, 3rd place in the Central and behind division rival Chicago who finished 90–73, earning them 2nd in the Central and a wild card berth. In winning the NL MVP award, Sosa finished with a .308 batting average, 66 home runs, and 158 RBI, besting McGwire, who finished with a .299 batting average, 70 home runs, and 147 RBI. The Cubs, however, were swept in the first round of the 1998 playoffs by the Atlanta Braves.\nIn 2001, only three years after McGwire and Sosa finally toppled Maris's record, the mark fell again, this time to San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds. Bonds broke the record on October 5 against Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers and, two days later, hit his 73rd home run of the season off the Dodgers pitcher Dennis Springer. Bonds' record continues to stand today.\nThe 1997 and 1998 home run record chases are widely credited by sports analysts as having restored interest in MLB among its fan base in the preceding years, as many had lost interest and felt betrayed by the strike in 1994, although others contest this.\nThe embrace, along with the constant praising of one another between McGwire and Sosa was spoofed in the fall of 1998 on \"Saturday Night Live\" by Will Ferrell (as McGwire) and Tracy Morgan (as Sosa) who try to one-up praising each other endlessly and then begin to slow-dance.\nSteroid controversy.\nThe Sosa-McGwire home run chase occurred during the steroid era. Bonds' record still stands, though the controversy over possible use of performance-enhancing drugs by McGwire and Sosa gained momentum when Bonds hit his 73 home runs despite having never hit as many as 50 in any other season. In the Congressional Hearing on Steroids, McGwire stated that any answer he gave regarding his alleged steroid use would not be believed by the public at-large anyway. Sosa seemed to not understand the questions.\nBonds has also been linked to steroids. He admitted to taking them, but he claims that he did not know what he was taking was steroids. Bonds and Sosa have been linked to illegal use of steroids in the Mitchell Report and other sources. McGwire has never been named by any official investigation; however, on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted to Bob Costas of the MLB Network that he did take steroids throughout his career, including during the 1998 season where he broke the record.\nHome run log.\nThe following table outlines home runs that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit during 1998 season."

        "text": "An open golf tournament usually refers to a golf tournament in which all golfers are eligible to play regardless of their professional or amateur status. Often there will be certain restrictions, commonly based on ability. Some amateur-only tournaments are also described as open, although by definition professional golfers are excluded.\nHistory.\nThe descriptor open is used in a number of sports, and especially in golf, to describe a tournament that is \"open\" — in theory to all — rather than being closed, i.e. one that is restricted to a particular group. Thus, an amateur tournament, e.g. the U.S. Amateur, is not by definition \"open\", because it is closed to professional golfers; however many are titled as such since they are open to all amateurs, e.g. the English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship for the Brabazon Trophy. The first precise usage of the adjective “open” in golf was in 1861 when the Prestwick Golf Club \"opened\" its Medal competition (launched the previous year for professionals only) to amateurs as well; ever since, The Open Championship has been open to all. Any golfer can, in theory, play in The Open either by invitation or by various forms of qualification. In practice, the event is a professional tournament in which a small number of the world’s leading amateurs also play, by invitation or qualification. \nOver time the descriptor \"open\" has been extended to include the premier national tournaments of many countries (starting with the U.S. Open in 1895) and also (mainly in the United States) to some other tournaments, e.g. the Buick Open.\nPrincipal national \"Opens\".\nThis is a list of the national \"Opens\" that have featured on the principal tours."

In 1905, Monmouthshire's best season, the county came second to Norfolk.\nAfter 1934, neighbouring Glamorgan, which had risen to first-class status in 1921, played fairly regularly at grounds within the Monmouthshire borders, including the county ground at Rodney Parade, Newport."

        "title": "Climbing rope",
        "text": "A climbing rope is a rope that is used in climbing. It is a critical part of an extensive chain of protective equipment (which also includes climbing harnesses, anchors, belay devices, and carabiners) used by climbers to help prevent potentially fatal fall-related accidents.\nClimbing ropes must meet very strict requirements so that they do not break in the event of an accidental fall. However, they also need to be light, flexible for knotting, and resistant to chafing over sharp and rough rocks; all that in all possible weather conditions. Although ropes made of natural fibres such as hemp and flax were used in the early days of alpinism, modern climbing uses kernmantle ropes made of a core of nylon or other synthetic material and intertwined in a special way, surrounded by a separate sheath woven over it. The main strength of the rope is in the core, and the sheath of the rope represents only a small fraction of the overall strength of the rope.\nClimbing ropes can be classified into three categories according to their elasticity: static, semi-static, and dynamic ropes.\nStatic rope.\nStatic ropes are ropes that are specifically designed for little or no stretch. As a result, they are unable to absorb large shocks. They should therefore not be used to protect a climber against a fall. On the other hand, they are particularly strong and can withstand a large load under static load. They find their application in fixed ropes, zip lines and shuttles.\nSemi-static rope.\nSemi-static ropes have limited stretch. They can absorb small shocks and are also statically loaded yet very strong. However, these ropes may not be used to protect climbers from falling. They are used as fixed ropes, for rescue operations, and in caving.\nDynamic rope.\nDynamic ropes are used in sport climbing. They are sufficiently stretchable to safely absorb a fall. However, they are relatively weak in static loads and therefore should not be used for zip lines and amusement rides. \nA falling climber quickly develops enormous kinetic energy. This energy is released as soon as the climber stops falling. Some of this energy goes to the belay chain, the rest is split between the belayer and the climber. The rigid parts of the belay chain are strong, but only absorb a limited amount of energy. The human body can also only handle a limited amount of force on the body (the so-called catch or impact value) without incurring a back injury. Dynamic ropes therefore are designed to stretch by a limited amount to catch falls. By stretching, a large part of the energy generated is captured so that the final capture impulse for a single rope is less than 12 kN, under testing conditions as defined in the CE standards. UIAA rules mandate that stretching be less than 40%.\nDynamic ropes can be \"single ropes\", \"half ropes\", and \"twin ropes\", each with different specifications.\nDry rope.\nDry ropes are ropes that have been treated to repel water. To achieve a UIAA Water Repellent grade, a rope must not absorb more than 5% of the rope's weight. This is in contrast to non-treated ropes which can absorb up to 50% of rope's weight in water.\nThe dry treatment prevents dirt and other particulates from getting into the rope, extending the rope life. However, the dry treatment will wear off with extended use. Dry ropes are more expensive than non-treated ropes, so they are typically saved for ice climbing or wet weather.\nMaintenance.\nRopes must be inspected regularly, and retired from use if significantly damaged or worn."

The conference was created when the NCAA instituted automatic qualifiers to the NCAA championship tournament; in so doing, it eliminated the \"western region\" bid.\nThe GWLL ceased operations in 2010, as a result of Notre Dame's 2008 decision to leave the conference for the newly established Big East lacrosse conference in 2010; the remaining GWLL schools, including the Air Force Academy, University of Denver, The Ohio State University, Quinnipiac University, and Bellarmine University, joined the ECAC, as a five-team GWLL would no longer have been eligible to receive an automatic bid to the NCAA championship tournament under the rule requiring conferences to have at least six members to qualify for the bid.\nHistory.\nThe GWLL was established in 1994. The original members were Air Force, Butler, Denver, Michigan State, Notre Dame, and Ohio State. Just prior to the 1997 season, Michigan State left the conference after the school dropped varsity lacrosse, leaving the league with five clubs. The NCAA requires a conference to have six members in order to be eligible for an automatic qualifier to the NCAA tournament. As a result, Fairfield was added as a sixth member. Fairfield later left the conference to join the ECAC and was replaced by Quinnipiac. Later, Butler left the GWLL when its athletic department dropped several sports programs including men's lacrosse in January 2007. Bellarmine was added to the conference in 2007 after the school began competing in Division I men's lacrosse in 2005.\nIn 2008, the GWLL held its first championship tournament. Previously, the GWLL champion was determined by regular-season results. Notre Dame won the championship with a 9-2 victory over Ohio State, earning an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. In addition to Notre Dame's automatic bid, Ohio State and Denver also received \"at-large\" bids to the NCAA tournament, giving the GWLL three teams in the tournament. The following year, in 2009, Notre Dame again won the GWLL championship, defeating Ohio State 16-7 in the conference's last tournament.\nAnnual Awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nNewcomer of the Year\nCoach of the Year"

Founded in 1999 with play beginning in 2000, this part of the conference only sponsored men's lacrosse. It disbanded at the end of the 2014 season as an indirect result of the early-2010s NCAA conference realignment.\nHistory.\nThe founding members included Georgetown University, Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), Rutgers University, Stony Brook University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the United States Naval Academy. In 2005, Loyola College in Maryland, Hobart College, and St. John’s University joined the ECAC. And in 2006, Fairfield University joined the league. In 2010, the league added Air Force, Bellarmine, Denver, Ohio State and Quinnipiac, replacing Georgetown, Rutgers and St. John's, who left for the original Big East Conference, and Massachusetts and Penn State, who left for the Colonial Athletic Association. In 2011, the ECAC added the University of Michigan Wolverines who were making their move from club level to NCAA Division I. They became full members in 2013, the same year in which Loyola's lacrosse team joined the rest of the school's sports in the Patriot League.\nAfter the 2013 season, a number of members announced their intention to exit the ECAC. In late May, following a second semi-finals appearance in three years, Denver announced that they would leave the ECAC to join the new Big East Conference for the 2014 season, leaving the ECAC with six teams for that season. In early June, the Big Ten Conference announced the start of conference competition in 2015, removing Michigan and Ohio State from the ECAC after the 2014 season. In mid-June, Fairfield announced it would join the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2015 season. On July 1, Hobart announced it would join the Northeast Conference beginning immediately for the 2014 season. One week later, Bellarmine announced it would become an affiliate of the ASUN Conference (then known as the Atlantic Sun Conference) for the 2015 season, leaving Air Force as the only ECAC school without a new conference home for 2015. Before Bellarmine's move took effect, the ASUN and Southern Conference (SoCon) announced a lacrosse alliance under which the two leagues split sponsorship of the sport, with women's lacrosse remaining in the ASUN and men's lacrosse shifting to the SoCon. Accordingly, Bellarmine played in the SoCon from the 2015 season until the ASUN established its own men's lacrosse league for the 2022 season.\nFinal members.\nMembership timeline.\n "

The species was originally described as \"Locusta punctatissima\" in 1792.\nDistribution.\nThe speckled bush-cricket is common across much of Europe. It ranges from the British Isles, France, Poland and Belgium in the west to the European parts of Russia in the east, and from southern Scandinavia in the north to southern Italy, Bulgaria and Greece. It has been recorded as far south as Israel. It is also present in the Nearctic realm.\nHabitat.\nThis species mainly occurs in dry shrubby environments, in open woodland, in scrub, hedgerows and in gardens, with birch, bramble and gorse.\nDescription.\n\"Leptophyes punctatissima\" can reach a body length of about . These bush-crickets are mainly grass-green with minute black speckles (more evident in the nymphs), as reflected in the common and Latin name of the species. Its colouring and secretive lifestyle, hidden away in the undergrowth, mean that it often passes unnoticed. The dorsal surface of the abdomen features an orangey-brown stripe; this is more pronounced in the male than the female. A yellow-white stripe extends backwards from the eyes. The lower legs and feet are brownish. The antennae are twice as long as the body. The species is brachypterous: the male's forewings are reduced to small flaps, and those of the female are even more reduced. The hindwings are completely absent, and both males and females are flightless. The female's ovipositor is laterally compressed and curves sharply upwards.\nBiology.\nThese bush-crickets can be found from April to November. Nymphs emerge in May and develop into their adults during late summer. Females lay their eggs in late summer in the bark of a tree or a plant stem. Then they overwinter until next spring.\nThe song of the male, produced by rubbing the right wing against a tooth-like projection at the base of the left, is short (1 to 10 ms) and feeble, barely audible to human ears; at a frequency of 40 kHz, it can best be heard with the aid of a bat detector. Unlike other cricket species, the female is able to respond to the male's calls with a weaker call of her own, which attracts the male to her."

It is a 'wandering' (or nomadic) club, having no home ground.\nThe Free Foresters were founded by the Rev. William Kirkpatrick Riland Bedford, who had been appointed rector of Sutton Coldfield in 1850. At Oxford University, he had discovered cricket and in 1847 he had set up the Sutton Coldfield Cricket Club. The name of the Free Foresters was chosen to reflect that archery had been popular at the Rectory Park long before cricket was introduced. The club played its first match on 20 July 1856 against the Pilgrims of the Dee, at the Rectory Ground in Sutton Coldfield. In 1863, the Free Foresters presented the rector with a silver salver as a token of their esteem. The salver can be seen at Lord's cricket ground.\nFor many years, starting in 1912, their matches against Oxford University and Cambridge University had first-class status, the last such game being that against Oxford at The Parks in June 1968. The Foresters' side in that match, which they won by 299 runs, was captained by Donald Carr and included Mike Brearley, Mike Groves, Richard Hutton and Gamini Goonesena.\nThe team colours are crimson, green and white, adopted in 1858. The badge consists of two capital Fs wrapped in a Hastings knot, with the motto 'United though Untied', signifying that players are free to play for other clubs, and even play against Free Foresters.\nIn 2008, the club established Free Foresters Academy to offer young cricketers matches at a representative level. The founding Hon. Patron was Christopher Martin-Jenkins MBE. Since 2010, the FF Academy has played in Minor Counties U25 competitions (against Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Lincolnshire) in a mixture of two-day, Twenty20 (Beynon Cup) and three-day formats, winning the three-day Tom Orford Trophy on a number of occasions. The academy was captained by David Smith until 2015 when he handed over to Paddy Sadler. In 2018, the academy was led by Ed Hyde."

Much of the code for the game was recycled from Boss Game Studio's first Nintendo 64 game, \"Top Gear Rally\". In particular, it used the same Alias plug-ins.\nWhile Kemco was still the publisher, the company's Japanese division pushed for the game to include a story mode in the Japanese version, in part due to marketing research which determined that \"Wave Race 64\" would have sold better in Japan if it had had a story. Boss Games took a tongue-in-cheek approach to adding story to the game, and opted to make the story mode an unlockable Easter egg in the U.S. version.\nOn January 22, 1998, the game was delayed for 4 months. The game was finally released on November 10, 1998 in the United States, followed by a Japanese release over a month later (December 18), before being ported to the PAL region and released on March 12, 1999.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nCritics had mixed opinions about the game and called the game a huge letdown. Reviewers criticized Boss Game Studios for delaying the game for 4 months to make the game \"as best as possible\". By pushing back the title, \"1080° Snowboarding\" was released before Twisted's delay, which sold more units and is now labeled a classic. According to reviewers, everything about the game was mediocre. The music was pleasurable, but the gameplay was frustrating and the graphics did not live up to the standards that \"1080° Snowboarding\" had set."

        "title": "Comparison of American football and rugby union",
        "text": "A comparison of American football and rugby union is possible because of the games' shared origins, despite their dissimilarities.\nRules.\nTackle.\nIn the event of a tackle in rugby the player may pass the ball behind him provided he is not on the ground. If the tackled player is on the ground, the ball must be released, allowing any other player (including the opposition) to pick up the ball (usually a ruck forms) and the play continues. In the event of a tackle in American Football the play is concluded and the team on offense maintains possession usually if either the ball was advanced past the first down marker (resulting in a first down and a renewal of the down count) or else the down count advances (although if the play was the fourth down play and the ball is not advanced past the first down marker then the defensive team would gain possession).\nForward pass.\nIn rugby union, it is against the rules to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction (towards opponents in-goal area): a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be offside anyway. In American football, a player behind the line of scrimmage (most often the quarterback) is permitted to throw the ball forward from behind the line of scrimmage, provided that only one forward pass may be attempted during each play. A player can attempt a forward pass if he has already received a backwards pass, provided he stays behind the line of scrimmage.\nComposition of teams.\nProfessional and most scholastic American football team play has evolved from a single team with all players except limited substitutions playing the entire game, to a specialized \"platoon\" system consisting of three separate units (offensive, defensive, and \"special teams\" used for kicking and punting) with only one of the three being on the field at a time. That is to say that in professional American football, the majority of players play in only one specialization (or \"one side of the ball\") – however, every player is eligible to play in any specialization.\nIn rugby the teams are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. Both groups of players participate in attacking and defensive plays and are on the pitch at the same time. Only the eight forwards take part in the \"set pieces\", which are ways to contest ball possession when there is a minor rule infringement or the ball passes out of bounds. These set pieces are scrums and line outs. A person's build and skill set determines which group they can play in. All forwards must be heavy and strong to scrummage well but not so heavy that they are too slow to partake in attacking plays. The backs are lighter and faster and include the expert kickers. The forwards numbered 1 to 8 are the players that need to have good all-round rugby skills as well as speed and strength. In professional rugby there are very few players who can play equally well in a variety of positions and most will play in the same position from youth. Every position in rugby has its own unique name (except for number 8) and associated skill base.\nIn most club and schoolhouse rugby union, the majority of players play both offense and defense, only being substituted for injury. Substitutes in American football can return to the game at any stoppage in play. In rugby union, any player substituted off for any reason, except for a 'blood' injury, is prohibited from returning to the field of play (with the possible exception of front-row forwards). Rugby teams may make up to seven substitutions. Each team must field 15 players at the start of each match. Players who are bleeding may receive medical treatment off pitch and are replaced until they have stopped bleeding. If the bleeding has not stopped after 15 minutes of \"real time\", the player will be permanently substituted. This can be down to officials' discretion, depending at which level the sport is played, where only minor medical assistance is needed to make the player fit to return to the field of play. Ejected players in American football can be replaced with a substitute.\nIn rugby union there are two different punishments. A yellow card can be shown for lesser infringements, which leads to the player being off the pitch for 10 minutes whilst the team will play with one less player for that duration. For more serious offenses, such as eye gouging or stamping in some cases, players can be shown a red card, which means they are off the pitch for the rest of the match and the team plays the rest of the match with 14 players. Players who are red carded automatically face a disciplinary hearing, and can be banned for a period of time from one week to permanently depending on the level of offence. Also, in a televised match, rugby union players can be \"cited\" (by an independent citing commissioner) for an act of foul play for which the referee did not send the player off. This means that players who committed an act of foul play which the referee did not see, or was more serious than the referee thought, still face a disciplinary panel and possible suspension.\nIn American football, players are only disqualified for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and related penalties (Fighting, Palpably Unfair Acts, etc.). Players sent off in this fashion must be replaced with another member of the team for the remainder of the game. In addition, disqualified players may be fined (in the NFL) and/or suspended (at all levels) for future games.\nDuration of game.\nA rugby union game is divided into two halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games, and breaks given halfway through each half if playing conditions are considered to be extreme) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an international match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead - any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or lineout, or when a team scores. This has led to some \"nail-biting\" finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. Something similar can occur at the end of either half in American football, though usually for only a few seconds of additional time, because a play that begins before the half expires continues until the ball is dead regardless of whether there is any time left on the clock. In both sports, the clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add stoppage time as is done in soccer/Association football. American football games are made up of four quarters of 15 minutes each (less at the high school and youth levels), but the clock stops and starts according to specific rules, so that a 15-minute quarter lasts much longer.\nIn the televised version of American football (both professional and major college level), the duration of such stoppages is often extended to accommodate the airing of commercial advertisements; this does not occur outside of the televised environment, where breaks in play are comparable to those in rugby union. In addition to this, the half-time break is typically 12 to 15 minutes; this intermission allows for resetting of strategy in both rugby and American football and adjusting to the opponent's schemes. During the American football halftime period, entertainment is provided for the fans in attendance, ranging from marching band performances in high school and college games to big-name entertainment for the Super Bowl (which usually has a longer-than-normal halftime in order to set up and break down whatever stage the halftime performer(s) will use). The entertainment in rugby varies from club to club but often includes kicking competitions involving members of the crowd, or youth rugby teams playing quick tournament games. Teams in the Super Rugby competition in the Southern Hemisphere often have cheerleaders and mascots; however, very few rugby union teams in the Northern Hemisphere have cheerleaders.\nGame play.\nIn both sports, the essence of the game is to carry the ball over the opponent's goal line (Rugby requires the ball to be placed on the ground with downward pressure to score). In both sports the ball may be passed backwards an unlimited number of times, but in American football the ball may be passed forward once (and only once) as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to rugby union, where the ball cannot be passed forward but only kicked or carried forward. Even when kicked, only the kicker or players behind the kicker are allowed to catch or interfere with play.\nIn both sports, play is stopped when the ball goes out of bounds, when a player or team commits a foul or after any scoring play. In American football, play is also stopped when a player is ruled down or when a forward pass falls incomplete.\nThe forward pass and the stoppage when a player with the ball is downed results in short plays and a generally episodic game play in American football, as opposed to the longer and more fluid passages of play found in rugby union. If a player in rugby is tackled then the ball must be released and any player arriving at the scene may pick up the ball and run with it. If two or more opposing players arrive at the same time then a ruck is formed and the players push each other to get at the ball before play continues.\nIn rugby, kicking during the flow of the game is done for tactical reasons (both offensive and defensive) or to score a goal. If the ball is recovered by the kicking team, it can lead to significant improvement in field position. It is also legal in rugby to kick at goal at any point in the game. This is called a drop goal. In American football, a team that kicks the ball during play automatically gives up possession and cannot recover the ball unless an error in catching the ball (drop), or while running after catching (fumble) is made by the receiving team; because of this, punting is typically done only when teams do not expect to be able to retain possession (i.e. on fourth down). Additionally, rule changes made in the late twentieth century mandated that field goals cannot be made in front of the line of scrimmage; this has led to the demise of the drop-kick field goal in American football. Catching (or recovering) and blocking kicked balls are integral skills in rugby as well as in American football.\nOrigins.\nVarious forms of football have been played in Britain for centuries with different villages and schools having their own traditional rules.\nThe Football Association was formed in England in October 1863. Differences of opinion about the proposed laws led to the formation of the first governing body for rugby, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) in 1871. Laws were drawn up for rugby football which was now distinct from association football (soccer).\nIn 1872 rugby clubs were established in the San Francisco Bay Area, which were composed mainly of British expatriates. The first recorded rugby match in the United States occurred on May 14, 1874 between Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and McGill University of Montreal, Quebec when McGill challenged Harvard to a game using rules in place at the Montreal campus.\nIn 1876, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, a competition based on the traditional rules of rugby. The sport of American football evolved from these intercollegiate games (see History of American football).\nBack in England, a schism developed between those who favoured amateurism (southern English teams) and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby (northern teams). In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away governing body, the Northern Union. The schism in English rugby was caused by several economic factors for the northern clubs which made up the majority of the teams. The Northern Union began to make changes to the laws of rugby in 1906, which resulted in the sport of rugby league. The Rugby Football Union's version of rugby became known as rugby union after its governing body.\nThe history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football, with several important early divergences, most notably the rule changes instituted in 1880 by Walter Camp, a Hopkins School and Yale University graduate, considered to be the father of American football. The popularity of college football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States for the first half of the twentieth century. \nAmerican professional football began in 1919 with a game pitting the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The American Professional Football Association formed in 1920 and changed its name to the National Football League (NFL) two years later. Initially a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.\nThe modern era of American football began at the 1932 NFL Playoff game, where several key innovations were first introduced, such as hash marks, forward passes from any location behind the line of scrimmage and the placement of the goal posts to the goal line. Further evolution in play strategy, tactics and rule development occurred throughout the 1930s. Notable events such as the American football game held at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the American football game at 1933 World's Fair led to the first college All-Star game in 1934, which, in turn, served as an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States. American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the twentieth century can be traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest generally thought of in American football history as the greatest game ever played. A rival league to the NFL, the American Football League (AFL), began playing in 1960. The subsequent pressure placed upon the NFL from its rival led to a merger between the two leagues in 1967. The new organization from this merger retained the NFL name, but was structured with two new conferences known as the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference, with teams distributed between the two mainly along the same lines as the former NFL and AFL.\nField.\nDimensions.\nThe dimensions of an American football field are measured in United States customary units (essentially the same as British Imperial units). Rugby union originally marked and quoted its measurements in Imperial but converted to Metric units in 1977. When these conversions were made the measurements were generally adjusted to the closest round-number measurement in the metric system.\nAlthough both codes are played on similar sized rectangular fields, the dimensions of rugby union fields can vary up to a maximum size that is larger than the fixed size of American football fields. Rugby union fields are limited to a maximum length of long ( between goal lines) and width of , while American football fields have a fixed length of ( between goal lines) and a width of . The end zone in American football has a fixed depth of whilst in Rugby Union the goal area must be between a minimum depth of and a maximum of between the goal line and the dead ball line at the rear of the field.\nLines.\nBoundary lines.\nAn American football \"field\" is bordered by \"sidelines\" and \"end lines\". A rugby union \"pitch\" has \"touchlines\" and \"dead-ball lines\", respectively. True to its rugby roots, the boundary lines in American football are also out of play (unlike in the majority of other sports where being in contact with the line means that the player or ball is still in-play).\nMajor interior lines.\nIn both rugby and American football all the major interior lines run transversely across the playing area.\nThe border between the regular field of play and a scoring zone in both sports is called the goal line (though it is more commonly referred to as the \"try line\" in rugby union).\nThe playing field of rugby is divided into halves by a halfway line. An American football field has a 50 yard line which is sometimes referred to as the \"midfield line\". On an American football field there are a further 18 solid yard lines crossing the field, marked at intervals between each goal-line and the 50 yard line. These lines are named for the distance that they are from the nearest goal line, for example 5 yard line, 10 yard line, 35 yard line, etc. Rugby union pitches have only two further solid lines called the 22 metre lines. They are so called because they are marked from the goal lines. This unusual distance exists because rugby changed from Imperial units to Metric units in 1977; the line had previously been a 25-yard-line. The metric equivalent of 25 yards is 22.86 metres which should round to 23 metres; some sources argue that the reason for rounding down to 22 was to further restrict players within the 1968 25-yard line kicking law; a rule that had been introduced to encourage more running play.\nIn rugby, the kickoff to begin each half and restarts after scores are taken from the halfway line whereas in American football these can be taken from the 30, 35 or 40 yard line depending on if it is a college, NFL or high-school game. The yard lines of American football are vitally important during game play because a team's advance is measured against them which, in turn, determines possession of the ball. The 22 metre lines in rugby union effectively divide the field into approximate quarters (though not always as rugby pitches vary in size; the total length of the field of play must not exceed 100m but can be shorter than that if space is limited). The 22 metre lines determine the position from which \"drop-outs\" are taken and also mark the limit where a defending player may kick-the ball directly (without bouncing) into touch without losing the ground gained by the kick.\nMinor transverse interior lines.\nIn American football there is a 2 yard line (for NFL 2-point conversions), 15 yard line (for NFL 1-point conversions) or \"3 yard line\" (college and high-school) which is sometimes called the PAT (point after touchdown) line. This is a short line marked the appropriate distance from the goal line directly in front of the posts and is where the line of scrimmage forms when one team has scored and is attempting a conversion. In rugby union there are two broken lines that cross the whole pitch marked ten metres either side of the halfway line. These are called the 10 metre lines and mark the minimum distance restart kicks must travel and the forward limit of where the receiving team can stand to receive these kicks.\nIn American football there are also four hash marks (one near each side line and a pair either side of the longitudinal center of the field) marked every yard between the major transverse lines. Though these technically run across the pitch they can more usefully be regarded as longitudinal lines because each hash mark is only a yard long and they are so numerous that they create more obvious pattern down the field than across it (see below).\nIn rugby union there is a line five metres from the goal line indicated by a series of six short dashes marked 5 metres in from touch, 15 metres in from touch and directly in front of each post (these are frequently called the five metre line though they technically have no name the 5 metre lines are longitudinal lines 5 metres in from touch). These are marked to assist the referee because no set-piece (scrum or line-out) may take place within five metres of the goal line.\nMinor longitudinal interior lines.\nAs described above, in American football there are four longitudinal lines made up of yard-long \"hashes\". These hash marks are marked at one yard intervals between each yard line and parallel to them. They further assist the umpires to determine how far the ball has been advanced each down and the central pair also mark the widest point at which any play may be initiated; all plays start with the ball on or between the middle pair of hash marks. In professional football these central hash marks are the same width as the goalposts (18 feet, 6 inches wide), in college football they are 40 feet apart and in high school football they are 53 feet, 4 inches apart.\nIn rugby there are four longitudinal dotted lines. Two are marked 5 metres in from the touch lines and two a further ten metres in. These are the 5 metre lines and 15 metre lines respectively. These are used to determine where players making up the \"line-out\" are allowed to stand before the throw-in. The five metre line also assists the referee because scrums may not be set within five metres of the touch line.\nBoth codes also have goalposts at each end of the field: on the goal-line in the case of rugby union; but further back in American football on the back of the end zone.\nAmerican football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts apart ( in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of , resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line.\nRugby union goalposts are apart and extend vertically from the ground being connected by a crossbar at , creating an H-shape. In both cases, only kicks passing between the uprights and above the crossbar score points. The scoring areas of both types of goalposts are technically infinite as there is no top boundary.\nAdvancing the ball.\nIn American football, the team that is in possession of the ball, the offense, has four downs to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after four downs, it loses possession of the ball.\nThe ball is put into play by a snap. All players line up facing each other at or behind the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the center, then passes (or \"snaps\") the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback.\nPlayers can then advance the ball in two ways:\nA down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:\nRugby union is based on the 'right to contest possession'. A team is not required to surrender possession when the ball carrier is tackled, in contrast to American football, where a team must surrender their possession when a player is tackled and no downs remain. Rugby union players must win possession in open play, unless the team in possession makes an infringement, scores, or the ball leaves the field of play.\nA team in rugby union can advance the ball in two ways:\nIn rugby the method of attack is typically decided by the person in the number ten jersey (the flyhalf). Once the forwards gain possession of the ball after a scrum, line out or ruck the ball is usually passed to this player who is the midpoint between the forwards and the backs. He/she must read the opposition's defensive strategy and calls a play accordingly, either running, passing or kicking to other players. After the set piece or ruck the no.10 is the first player who has time to control the play and must therefore be an expert at a wide variety of kicks and an expert passer. The rule differences mean that there are a wider variety of kicks and kicking strategies in rugby compared to American football.\nPossession may change in different ways in both games:\nIn both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. In American football, it is normal to punt on the last down, but, as in rugby union, a kick can take place at any phase of play.\nPassing.\nIn American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby.\nThe ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby union. However designed laterals (often known as pitches) which take place behind the line of scrimmage are quite common in American football and are often a way that a ball is transferred from the quarterback to a running back on sweep plays or to a wide receiver on speed sweeps or a reverse.\nIn both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands.\nTackles and blocks.\nIn both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent him or her from making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in American football, the ball is still in play. Players from either team can take possession of the ball. The tackled player must present the ball (release the ball) so that open play can continue.\nRugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\nIn American football, tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often \"tackled\" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock him to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier from behind by the pads or jersey behind his neck is known as a \"horse collar\", a move now illegal at all levels of the American game). If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually tackled to the ground.\nIn American football, as a tactic within an offensive play, designated offensive position players are assigned to 'block' defensive players, by projecting the front of their body forward into the front or side of the defensive player, in order to impede the ability of the defensive player to tackle the ball carrier. A complicated set of rules, however well-understood by the players, coaches and officials, determines the legality of the block. Illegal blocks, when observed by the officials, are flagged for penalties that vary in their severity, depending upon the particular infraction. Blocks are not permitted in rugby union and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.\nScoring.\nA touchdown is the American football equivalent of the rugby try. Unlike American football, both codes of rugby require the ball to be grounded, whereas in American football it is sufficient for the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) when in the possession of a player. In American football a touchdown scores 6 points; in rugby union a try is worth 5 points; and 4 points in rugby league.\nRugby also allows for a penalty try, awarded by the referee when he believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team's misconduct. In comparison, American football allows the referee to declare that a \"Palpably unfair act\" was committed by the defending team: the referee is allowed in such a situation (at his discretion) to award a score (most commonly a touchdown) or other penalty (in amateur play, including forfeiture of the game). In practice, however, such a call is extremely rare and limited to extreme circumstances, such as a player who was not in the game at the start of the play running off of the sidelines and tackling the player with the ball, as was the case in the 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic. In high school football, this can also be called if the defense commits repeated and intentional fouls at the goal line.\nIn both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an extra point (worth 1 point); in rugby union it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). (The result is that both the touchdown/extra point combination and the try/conversion combination, when successful, total to 7 points.) One key difference between an extra point and a conversion is that a conversion kick must be taken from a position in line with where the try was scored, although the distance from the try line from which the conversion kick is taken is not fixed. Hence, it is advantageous to ground the ball under the posts rather than in the corner which makes for a more difficult kick. Also, American football features the option of the going for a 2-point conversion, where the attacking team gets one chance from 3 yards out (2 in the NFL) to get the ball in the end zone again. This would be worth 2 points on top of the 6 already awarded for the touchdown. Plus, all American football, except high school (all but Texas), allows conversion turnovers that are returned for touchdowns to be given 2 points.\nIn American football teams often opt to go for a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown, either because it is fourth down and they don't want to risk a turnover or because it is late in the game and the three points will either tie the game or put the team ahead. The rugby equivalent is a drop goal (worth 3 points). The key difference between a field goal and a drop goal is that a field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked immediately as it touches the ground.\nIn American football, a field goal is generally kicked from seven yards behind the line of scrimmage, with the \"holder\" receiving a \"long snap\" from the center. This is the optimum distance for a kick to be made before the defensive team can break through the line of scrimmage to block the kick. When calculating the distance of a kick, one adds seven yards to the line of scrimmage, then adds ten more to account for the end zone (as the goal posts are in the back of the end zone) Therefore, if the line of scrimmage is the 20-yard line, a field goal taken from there would be a 37-yard kick - the ball would be set down for the kick at the 27, plus 10 yards for the end zone.\nBecause of the mechanics of the kick, field goals are only attempted from a very specific range. In the modern NFL any kick under 40 yards is considered very makeable and should be converted by a competent kicker. Kicks from 40-45 yards are considered more challenging, but usually makeable, kicks from the 50 yard range are considered difficult. Kicks from 55 or more yards are considered extremely difficult, and are normally only attempted in dire situations at the end of the game when the field goal would tie or win the game. The record for longest field goal is 66 yards, which has been done once by Justin Tucker in 2021. A 65-yard kick by Ola Kimrin was made during a preseason exhibition game in 2002, but preseason games are not included in record keeping. Notably, the 65-yard kick was made in Denver, Colorado, where the elevation is . Tucker's record field goal was made in Ford Field, a domed stadium in Detroit, Michigan.\nA similar concept in rugby is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting, or forming a scrum. This scores 3 points. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground, but it cannot be charged. There is no direct equivalent to a penalty goal in American football. A rare play called a \"fair catch kick\" is analogous to a goal from mark which existed in rugby union at one time.\nAmerican football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby. If the team with possession causes the ball to enter its own end zone, and the ball carrier is then tackled while within the end zone, then this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the non-possessing team and then requires the possessing team to give up the ball by kicking to its opponent. In rugby union this does not score any points but results in a scrum 5 meters from the try zone with the team that didn't put the ball into the in-goal area putting the ball in.\nIn rugby, If the ball is put past the try line by the attacking team, into the in-goal area, by means of kicking, passing or running and the receiving team grounds it or makes it dead immediately, a drop kick from the 22-metre line ensues. In American football, if a kick-off or punt lands in the end zone and the receiving team downs the ball without leaving the end zone, the result is a touchback. On a touchback, the receiving team gains possession of the ball at their own 25-yard line in both college and professional football on kickoffs and free kicks after a safety, with the NCAA having changed from the 20-yard line in 2012 and the NFL making the same change in 2018. The NCAA made a further rule change effective in its 2018 season, treating a fair catch on a kickoff, or free kick following a safety, between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line as a touchback. All other touchback situations in both rule sets result in possession at the 20-yard line.\nAn important difference between the two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In American football, the scoring team kicks off, except after a safety. In rugby union, the team conceding the score kicks off (in rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union featuring seven players per side, the scoring team kicks off).\nPlayers.\nIn modern American football, a team consists of an offensive, a defensive and a \"special\" (involved in placekicking, punting, kickoffs, and kick returns) three separate teams units. Only eleven players can be on the field at any time. Players are allowed to play on more than one of the units, this is the norm for all but the highest levels of play (professional and large schools). The kicking unit, with the exception of a few specialists, will usually be made up of reserve players from the offense and defense.\nIn rugby union, the same players have to both defend and attack. There are fifteen players in a rugby union team (except in sevens and tens).\nMany of the positions in each code have similar names, but, in practice, the roles of those positions can be different. A fullback in American football is very different from a fullback in rugby. Some of the positions are fairly similar; a Rugby fly-half carries out a similar role to a quarterback in American football; however, quarterbacks touch the ball on almost every offensive play, and the fly-half also has roles similar to the running back and punter (so it's more like dual-threat quarterback or triple-threat man).\nBroadly speaking, linemen and linebackers in American football correspond to forwards in rugby, and running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks have roles similar to backs in rugby.\nBecause of the playing time, number of pauses, number of players and the nature of the game in general, rugby players will typically need higher physical endurance than American football players while more short-term bursts of physical strength, power, and speed will be required in American football (amongst equivalent positions and weights). Collisions between players in American football tend to cause greater injury than in rugby union; in rugby union tackles must at least show an attempt to bind is made but this rule does not apply to American football. Moreover, rugby union hits are not usually at the speed of American football both because of the nature of the game and the lack of protective equipment. Additionally, rugby offsides rules and the lack of a forward pass significantly reduce the chance of a player receiving a \"blind-side\" hit (i.e. being hit and/or tackled from behind). In American football, players receiving a forward pass are often extremely vulnerable because they must concentrate on catching the ball, often jumping very high or stretching out and thereby exposing their body to punishing hits; in rugby a player is not allowed to be tackled in the air, leaving the receiver of the kick with more time to assess his surroundings, usually in rugby ball carriers can anticipate a hit and can brace themselves accordingly.\nIn rugby, the contact times between players are usually much longer, as a more wrestling approach is required to bring players down, as momentum cannot always be relied upon particularly when the lines between the teams are consistently close, not allowing for significant momentum to be developed before meeting a defender. In rugby, rucks and mauls may develop following a tackle when multiple players from each team bind together to move the ball in play (on the ground or in-hand respectively). In American football, equivalents to rucks and mauls are virtually non existent, as play normally stops when the ball is stopped but blocking and fumble have some similarities to them. These differences can be summed up in the idea that in American football the objective is to bring the player to ground or to disrupt a pass to end the play, whereas in rugby the main objective is to stop the player from breaking the line.\nAmerican football quarterbacks, linebackers, - and increasingly, their coaches - have the ability to decide what the next play would be in many occasions during the game, thus allowing for both complex tactics displayed within individual plays and overall game-wide strategy in play calling and play selection. In rugby union, the continuous nature of the game implies that there is no time to discuss team strategy, therefore offensive actions may seem to lack a definite direction for some periods of time; thus, Rugby is more impromptu, whereas American football is more premeditated.\nRugby players often continue to participate in the game long after they have left school. In America, amateurs who have left school rarely play full tackle football, but often play touch football or flag football.\nAttire.\nRugby union players are allowed to wear modest padding on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet World Rugby standards, and the vast majority of players play with only a gumshield for protection, and no armor. Although protective headgear is becoming more popular with players that have a history of concussion or those who wish to protect their ears from damage (usually front or second rows). But hard plastic or metal are prohibited in rugby kit. This includes hard plastic shin guards as well. The only metal that is allowed in any rugby kit is World Rugby-approved soft aluminium studs underneath shoes.\nThe prohibition of metal resulted in one of the most unusual pieces of protective gear ever seen in any sport in a 2010 Heineken Cup semifinal between Biarritz and Munster. Biarritz star Imanol Harinordoquy had suffered a broken nose in a domestic encounter with Racing Métro's Sébastien Chabal, and had undergone surgery to repair it. He received approval to wear a mask to protect the injury, but had to have the frame covered by more than of foam padding; at least one journalist likened Harinordoquy to the Man in the Iron Mask.\nOften considered an essential (though not mandatory) part of the safety equipment needed for rugby is the gumshield or mouthguard. Players also have the option to use fingerless gloves which have been introduced recently to the game allowing players to better grip the ball, although it is rarely seen.\nAmerican football players wear and in general make use of much bulkier protective equipment, such as a padded plastic helmet, shoulder pads, hip pads and knee pads. These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. An American football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of force in the game which, unprotected and in current form, would now be extremely dangerous. An example of this is the trend for players tackling head first rather than leading with a shoulder, which has led to some serious neck injuries, including breaks, even with the helmets used. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in rugby union, with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries."

        "text": "Australia A is the second national Rugby union team of Australia, behind the Wallabies. Matches played under the 'Australia A' title are traditionally non-test match fixtures and often offer a stepping-stone to Wallaby national selection. Aspiring Wallaby players were given a chance to impress selectors during these games. In the past, the team would also play touring sides, such as the British &amp; Irish Lions, or play mid-week games when the Wallabies are on tour.\nHistory.\nOfficially formed in 2001 as part of the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, Australia A played host to the British &amp; Irish Lions in a mid-week game and offered fringe Wallabies players a chance to impress the national selectors ahead of the test series. Australia A won the match 28–25, inflicting the Lions' first loss of the tour.\nAustralia A next formed in 2003 as part of the 2003 Rugby World Cup warm-ups and 2003 June rugby union tests, where they faced Japan in back-to-back matches coming away with two victories in Osaka and Tokyo. Up until 2004, Australia A was used as a team to offer touring teams a chance to play mid-week matches or developing rugby nations a chance to play stronger opposition to maintain non-test match status. However, in November 2004, Australia A was used when the Wallabies toured Europe, whereby they played the French Barbarians in the lead up to the national sides meeting later on tour in Paris.\nBy 2005, Australia A had won every match they had played in, but after playing the Junior All Blacks (the All Blacks second team at the time) in 2005, their unbeaten run came to an end, losing 23–19 in Canberra.\nIn 2006, Australia was originally invited to take part in the inaugural IRB Pacific Nations Cup but decided against sending a team, stating a need to focus on domestic competition. However, Australia did however host two games in the opening stages of the 2006 tournament, where Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium hosted Tonga vs Fiji and later Tonga vs Samoa. Australia A later played two matches against Fiji after the 2006 tournament, and then joined the competition in 2007.\nIn the 2007 Pacific Nations Cup, Australia A played 5 matches for 3 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss. The team finished second in the tournament won by the Junior All Blacks.\nIn the 2008 Pacific Nations Cup, Australia A played 5 matches for 4 wins and 1 loss. The team finished second in the tournament won by New Zealand Māori. At the end of the 2008, however, the Australian Rugby Union decided to scrap the Australia A team, citing financial constraints. Australia withdrew from the 2009 tournament.\nDespite withdrawing from the Australia A programme, between 2009 and 2010, Australia fielded several XV sides against Home Nations clubs, and although not officially titled Australia A, the side was often referred to it with these games used for fringe Wallabies players. For the 2010 England tour to Australia, the ARU arranged for the Australian Barbarians Rugby Club to play two matches against the visiting England national team. This side was nominated as the second national team and was, as such, essentially Australia A by another name for the England matches. The Australian Barbarians also played a pre-World Cup friendly against Canada in 2011.\nAustralia XV also returned in 2016, when they played against the French Barbarians during the Wallabies Spring tour. The side was selected from a handful of fringe players and with the team not being the official Wallabies side, the selectors were able to select players from outside the Australian Rugby Union selection policy and chose players based in Europe.\nIn February 2020, Rugby Australia had hinted at a possible return of the Australia A side where they would face Tier 2 opposition to strengthen the sides. However, any possible plans where paused due the COVID-19 pandemic, and in May 2022 having not formally participated in any event since 2008, the Australia A team was reignited by Rugby Australia to compete in the Pacific Nations Cup for July 2022 against Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, to take place in Fiji.\nResults.\nOther matches.\nMatches played by the Australian Barbarians Club, Australia XV or Australia 'B' when selected as the second national team:\nSquad.\nOn 5 July 2023, a 25-player squad was named for Australia A's match against Tonga on 14 July.\nOn 10 July, Pone Fa'amausili and Blake Schoupp were called up to the Wallabies for their 2023 Rugby Championship match against Argentina whilst Taniela Tupou was temporality released by the Wallabies to join up with Australia A.\nHead coach: Jason Gilmore"

        "text": "Paul Thompson (born November 23, 1983) is a former American football quarterback. He was signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 2007. He played college football at Oklahoma. He has also played for the Tennessee Titans.\nEarly years.\nThompson attended Leander High School in Leander, Texas and was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, as a senior, he passed for 1,600 yards and rushed for 1,053 yards.\nCollege career.\nThompson was ranked as the #8 athlete in the country upon entering college. He had been courted by both the University of Texas and Oklahoma but chose to play for the Sooners because they would give him the opportunity to play quarterback. He turned down Texas due to the fact they wanted him to play as a wide receiver. Ironically, after former Oklahoma quarterback Rhett Bomar took over as the starter in 2005, Thompson asked to be moved to the wide receiver position.\n2002 season.\nHe arrived on campus in the fall of 2002 as a backup to both Jason White and Nate Hybl. He was scheduled to be redshirted that season. During the second game of the year against Alabama, starter Jason White hurt his knee, forcing Hybl to take his spot. More importantly for Thompson was the fact that he would not be redshirted in 2002. He would receive playing time in four games, but did not start, remaining the second-string quarterback.\n2003 season.\nAfter the Sooner Rose Bowl win, Hybl graduated, leaving White and Thompson the quarterback job. Jason White earned the top spot, once again leaving Thompson on the bench. White led the team, and ultimately ended up winning the Heisman Trophy. Paul played in 10 games in 2003.\n2004 season.\nThompson expected to have the job all to himself in 2004, but special circumstances allowed Jason White to play another year. White led the team to an undefeated regular season. Thompson was redshirted for the season.\n2005 season.\nWith Jason White gone, Paul would battle with Rhett Bomar for the starting spot. Thompson earned the starting role against TCU in the first game of the season. Thompson was benched in the middle of the game in favor of Bomar. From then on, Bomar would take most of the snaps under center, leaving Thompson to a new position, wide receiver.\n2006 season.\nIn his last collegiate season, chances for Thompson to start at quarterback or wide receiver looked unlikely. On August 2, 2006 Rhett Bomar and offensive lineman J.D. Quinn were dismissed from the football team. Thompson regained the duties of the starting quarterback for the Sooners. His first game as starter for the 2006 season was a 24-17 victory on September 2, 2006 against UAB. Thompson threw for 227 yards with two interceptions and two touchdown passes, including a 69-yard pass to Adrian Peterson for a touchdown. It was soon after this performance that Thompson would be renamed Paul \"Prime-Time\" Thompson.\nAfter going 3-2 in their first five games, he helped lead the Sooners to 8 straight wins, including the Big 12 Championship Game win over Nebraska in Kansas City. This win propelled the Sooners to a BCS berth in the Fiesta Bowl on New Years Day. The Sooners lost this game in overtime to Boise State University in a very close game, in which Paul Thompson threw three interceptions and lost a fumble. Paul then was later added into The Oklahoma Sooner Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThompson signed as an undrafted free agent on May 16, 2007.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn January 9, 2008, Thompson signed with the Tennessee Titans. He was waived on July 24."

        "text": "Mark Christopher Jones (born November 3, 1980) is a former American football wide receiver. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tennessee.\nJones was also a member of the New York Giants, San Diego Chargers and Carolina Panthers.\nCollege career.\nAfter leading Strath Haven High School to two PIAA state championships, Mark Jones played all over the field at the University of Tennessee, seeing action at wide receiver, safety, punt returner, and kick returner. For his career, he caught 36 passes for 556 yards (a 15.4 avg.) and five touchdowns, all during his senior season in 2003. He also rushed seven times for 65 yards. As a defensive back, Jones racked up 116 career tackles, four interceptions, ten defended passes, two forced fumbles, one tackle for a loss, and one recovered fumble. On the special teams side of the ball, he returned 46 punts for 543 yards and one touchdown; he also returned four kickoffs for 138 yards and one touchdown. His longest kickoff return was 82 yards for a touchdown against the University of Alabama in his junior year (2002). In his senior year, he ranked second in the SEC and third in the national standings, averaging 15.7 yards per punt return. Jones majored in psychology.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nJones was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 206th pick of the 2004 NFL Draft. However, he was waived on September 5, 2004.\nNew York Giants.\nJones was then picked up by the New York Giants the next day. Jones was the primary punt returner for the Giants, starting in 14 games at the spot. He also lined up at wide receiver and defensive back occasionally throughout the season. Jones finished the season with 227 yards on 34 returns (6.7 average) and his longest return was for 29 yards. He also returned two kickoffs for 37 yards, with a long of 20 yards. Jones, however did not make an impact with the Giants, and after missing the last two games with an injury, was released.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (second stint).\nThe Giants released Mark Jones on September 3, 2005, and he was picked up by the Buccaneers on September 7. He played in all sixteen regular season games and the Buccaneers' only playoff game against the Washington Redskins. Because of the Buccaneers' #1 defense, the opposing team was forced to punt to Jones, which is why he led the team with an NFL-best 51 punt returns for 492 yards. In a game against the Atlanta Falcons, Jones returned a punt in overtime 28 yards to set up a game-winning Matt Bryant field goal. Jones returned four punts for 37 yards in the NFC Wild Card Round. Following a season-ending knee injury suffered on October 21, 2007, Jones was placed on IR October 24.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nOn June 20, 2008, Jones signed with the San Diego Chargers. He was released on August 30 during final cuts.\nCarolina Panthers.\nJones was signed by the Carolina Panthers after the team waived wide receiver Dominique Thompson. He returned 39 punts and 40 kickoffs for 1,433 yards in 2008, his only season with the team. In Carolina's Divisional Round playoff loss to Arizona, he returned five kickoffs for 151 yards.\nTennessee Titans.\nJones was signed by the Tennessee Titans on March 18, 2009, after incumbent returner Chris Carr signed with the Baltimore Ravens. The Titans released Jones on September 4. He was re-signed on September 29. On May 25, 2010, his contract was terminated.\nPersonal life.\nMark Jones was a community contributor with the Giants in 2004, helping out as a professor at the Giants' \"Football 101\" program in New York City. He also spoke to children in New York elementary schools about staying healthy and making right choices. In high school, he was a starting tailback and defensive back for four years at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. He was the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Player of the Year and USA Today Player of the Year for Pennsylvania in 1999. Jones led his high school team to a 15–0 record as a senior and was named Class 3A All-State."

In 1994, North Auckland changed its name to the Northland Rugby Football Union. They played their first ever match as a union on 3 August 1920, in an 11-0 victory over South Island Country. However, they did not play their first inter-union match until 27 July 1922, an 8-6 loss to Auckland. Their first inter-union win came in August 1923, when they beat King Country\nThe Auckland Rugby Union and Northland Rugby Union became regular rivals. They had Ranfurly Shield victories over them in 1960 and 1971. Northland won the Ranfurly Shield on two further occasions. 1950, when they defeated South Canterbury and 1978, when they defeated Manawatu. In the 1971 challenge Northland won 17-12 in a narrow match played in front of 47,000 people at Eden Park, Auckland. The following season 40,000 spectators packed Whangārei Okara Park to watch the rematch. With the city's population only 34,000, this showcased the significance of both the shield and the rivalry with Auckland. However they lost 15-16.\nThe reputation of Northland rugby took a downfall following its controversial victory over Manawatu in 1978. After what seemed to be an excessive amount of stoppage time, Northland kicked a winning penalty. What followed was the refusal that the union wouldn’t put the shield on the line for its final home matches of the season against Southland and Otago. However no rules were broken.\nProfessional era.\nNorthland began their professional era playing in the inaugural Air New Zealand Cup competition. They are known as the Taniwha, a reference to the mascot adopted in the professional era. Along with Auckland and North Harbour, Northland is part of the Blues Super Rugby franchise.\nSeason standings.\nThe following is a summary of every season for the Northland Taniwha since 2006. Position indicates the teams regular season finish.\nKey:\n\"Blue bar denotes Championship division\"\nRecords and statistics.\nAll Blacks.\nNorthland has produced 32 All Blacks to date. Below is a list of Northland New Zealand national rugby union players along with their All Black number, year of debut and number of All Black games."

        "text": "John Matthew Adams (born July 27, 1946) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 22 games in the National Hockey League for the Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals between 1972 and 1975. He was born in Port Arthur, Ontario.\nEarly life.\nA native of Port Arthur, Ontario, Adams played junior hockey with his hometown Port Arthur team. He is one of the only players to appear in four consecutive Memorial Cup tournaments. \nCareer.\nIn 1967, Adams signed with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. Assigned to the minor league Dayton Gems of the International Hockey League, Adams played two seasons with the Gems, winning the leading goaltending award in 1969. In the fall of 1969, he was assigned to the Bruins' leading farm team at the time, the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League, for whom he played for the next two seasons, winning honors as a league first-team all-star in 1972.\nDuring the 1970 playoffs, Adams was recalled to the Bruins as a reserve to back up regular goaltenders Gerry Cheevers and Ed Johnston. He did not play a game, yet the Bruins decided to engrave his name on the Stanley Cup upon winning the championship, making him one of the few players to have his name on the Stanley Cup before playing an NHL game.\nAdams would not play his first NHL game for another three seasons. In 1972–73, with Cheevers gone to the World Hockey Association and disruption in the Boston net, he played fourteen games for the defending champion Bruins while splitting his time with the new Bruins' affiliate Boston Braves of the American Hockey League.\nTraded to the minor-league San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League the following year, Adams won second-team all-star honors before being sold to the Washington Capitals in 1974. He played only eight games with the Capitals, again splitting the season between the NHL and the minor leagues.\nAdams was named a player-coach for the Thunder Bay Twins of the Ontario Senior League the following year, before retiring as a player five seasons later, settling in the Thunder Bay area in retirement. His final position in professional hockey was as an assistant coach for the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks of the Colonial Hockey League in 1991."

There were six annual versions of the game released, starting with \"High Heat Baseball 1999\", and ending with \"High Heat Major League Baseball 2004\".\nWith the exception of the first game in the series, the officially licensed teams and player names from all 30 Major League Baseball teams were included. The series was created by games company 3DO (under the Team .366 brand), which filed for bankruptcy in 2003, soon after the release of the final version of the series, \"High Heat Major League Baseball 2004\". In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the \"High Heat\" franchise from 3DO; however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.\n\"High Heat\" was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors \"World Series Baseball\", \"All-Star Baseball\", or \"Triple Play\", but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality.\nReception.\nAt the core of \"High Heat\"′s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.\nAccording to GameDaily, \"Although [the original] \"High Heat Baseball\" was not a big seller, the game won numerous awards\"."

        "title": "Sam Jones (baseball)",
        "text": "Samuel \"Toothpick\" Jones (December 14, 1925 – November 5, 1971) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the Cleveland Indians, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles between 1951 and 1964. He batted and threw right-handed.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Stewartsville, Ohio, Jones played for several Negro league teams, including the Orlando All-Stars and Oakland Larks in 1946; and the Cleveland Buckeyes, where he played under the management of Quincy Trouppe, in 1947 and 1948; and the Kansas City Royals, a \"touring Negro League squad handpicked by Satchel Paige.\" In 1948-49 he played in Panama, and then, with the end of the Negro National League, played semi-pro ball until he was signed by the Indians organization in the fall of 1949, playing Class A ball in the season and winter ball for Panama in 1949–50.\nMajor League career.\nJones began his major league career with the Cleveland Indians in 1951. When he entered a game on May 3, 1952, 39-year-old rookie Quincy Trouppe, a Negro league veteran, was behind the plate. Together they formed the first black battery in American League history. Both Sam Jones and Quincy Trouppe played for the Cleveland Buckeyes in the Negro American League.\nAfter the season, the Tribe traded him to the Chicago Cubs for two players to be named later, one of whom was slugger Ralph Kiner. In , the Cubs traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in a multi-player deal; prior to the season, he was dealt this time to the San Francisco Giants for Bill White and Ray Jablonski. He was picked 25th by the expansion Houston Colt .45s in the expansion draft, then traded to the Detroit Tigers for Bob Bruce and Manny Montejo. He rejoined the Cardinals for the campaign and played 1964 with the Baltimore Orioles. He spent the final three years of his pro career as a relief pitcher with the Columbus Jets of the International League before retiring at the end of the 1967 season.\nLegacy.\nDuring his career, Jones was known for his sweeping curveball, in addition to a fastball and changeup. Stan Musial once remarked, \"Sam had the best curveball I ever saw... He was quick and fast and that curve was terrific, so big it was like a change of pace. I've seen guys fall down on curves that became strikes.\"\nDuring his career, Jones led the National League in strikeouts, and walks, three times: in , 1956, and . On May 12 of the first of these three seasons, he no-hit the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–0 at Wrigley Field, becoming the first African American in Major League history to pitch a no-hitter. He achieved this after walking Gene Freese, Preston Ward (who was pinch-run for by Román Mejías) and Tom Saffell to begin the ninth inning, he left the bases loaded by striking out Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente and Frank Thomas in succession. His greatest year came with the Giants in 1959, when he led the league in both wins with 21 (tying him with Milwaukee Braves starters Lew Burdette and Warren Spahn) and ERA with 2.83. He was named 1959 National League Pitcher of the Year by \"The Sporting News\", but finished a distant second to Early Wynn of the Chicago White Sox for the Cy Young Award. He was named to the NL All-Star team twice, in 1955 and 1959.\nJones is one of the Black Aces, African-American pitchers with at least 20 wins in a single MLB season.\nDeath.\nJones died from a recurrence of neck cancer first diagnosed in 1962, in Morgantown, West Virginia on November 5, 1971, at the age of 45."

        "text": "The swimming competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place from 9 to 17 August 2008 at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre. The newly introduced open water marathon events (10 km) were held on 20 and 21 August 2008 at Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park.\nSwimming featured 34 events (17 male, 17 female), including two 10 km open-water marathons. The remaining 32 were contested in a 50 m long course pool within the Olympic Park.\nThe United States claimed a total of 31 medals (12 golds, 9 silver, and 10 bronze) in the leaderboard to maintain its standings as the most successful nation in swimming. A stellar performance in the pool also made an Olympic history for Michael Phelps, who captured eight gold medals to break Mark Spitz's 1972 record, a total of seven, at a single Games. Despite the male swimmers failing to attain a single gold in swimming, Australia managed to repeat a second-place effort on its third consecutive Olympics with 20 medals (six golds, six silver, and eight bronze). Meanwhile, Great Britain finished third with a total of six medals by the benefit of a sterling long-distance freestyle double from Rebecca Adlington.\nA total of 25 world records and 65 Olympic records were set during the competition.\nVenue.\nAll the swimming, synchronized swimming, and diving events of the 2008 Olympics were held at the Beijing National Aquatics Center (better known as the \"Water Cube\"), which was claimed to be built to increase the speed of the swimmers. The main pool is about deep, deeper than any other Olympic pool. The lane lines, nicknamed \"wave eaters\", buffer the waves produced by swimmers while they stroke. The technological advances of the pool were enhanced by several advantages inherent to an indoor swimming venue, namely: temperature, humidity and lighting control. Even the wide decks were built to help give the swimmers a sense of space.\nEvents.\nThe swimming program for 2008 was expanded from 2004, with the addition of the 10 km marathon open water swimming events, bringing the total number of events to 34 (17 each for men and women). The following events were contested (all pool events were long course, and distances are in metres unless stated):\nSchedule.\nUnlike the previous Olympics, swimming program schedule occurred in two segments. For the pool events, prelims were held in the evening, with semifinals and final in the following morning session, spanning a day between semifinals and finals in those events with semifinals. The shift of the normal morning prelims and evening finals (to evening prelims and morning finals) occurred for these Games because of the prior request made by US broadcaster NBC (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on May 7, 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games and is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC), so that the finals from the event could be shown live in the United States.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter up to 2 qualified athletes in each individual event if both meet the A standard, or 1 athlete per event if they meet the B standard. An NOC may also enter a maximum of 1 qualified relay team per event. NOCs may enter swimmers regardless of time (1 swimmer per sex) if they have no swimmers meeting qualifying B standard.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 1,026 swimmers (571 men and 455 women) from 162 nations would compete in swimming events at these Olympic Games. American Samoa, Botswana, Comoros, Congo Democratic Republic, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, and Tanzania made their official debut in swimming. Meanwhile, Belgium, Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Netherlands Antilles, and Tajikistan returned to the sport after an eight-year absence. Nations with swimmers at the Games are (team size in parentheses):\nMedal summary.\nMedal table.\nRetrieved from 2008 NBC Olympics website.\nOlympic and world records broken.\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, new world records were set 25 times (affecting 21 distinct world records) and new Olympic records were set 65 times and one other was equalled (affecting 30 distinct Olympic records). Only Ian Thorpe's 3:40.59 in the 400 metres freestyle and Inge de Bruijn's 56.61 in the 100 metres butterfly, both set in Sydney, remained Olympic records. Michael Phelps of the United States also broke the record for the most gold medals ever won by an Olympian with a total of 14; 8 of which were won during the 2008 Summer Olympics - this was also a world record.\nMen.\nNote: At the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay final, anchor Jason Lezak swam the fastest 100 m split (46.06); however, this is not considered an official FINA record, as he did not swim the first leg.\nLZR Racer suits.\nAnother big change to swimming occurred when Speedo launched the LZR Racer swim suits on February 13, 2008. The suits, developed by the Australian Institute of Sport, were designed to repel water, allow oxygen to flow to the muscles, and hold the body in a more hydrodynamic position. The suits had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%. Due to the advantage provided by the suits, some swimmers complained about the fairness in its use, because some people used multiple swimsuits to improve buoyancy and compressing of body; the official blog for the National Collegiate Athletic Association pondered whether they were \"technology doping\" and what was the difference between gaining advantage from a swimsuit and gaining advantage from performance-enhancing drugs. In response to these complaints, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) scheduled a meeting with Speedo to discuss the suits. After the meeting, FINA dismissed the claims of cheating, and endorsed the suits for future swimming meets. By August 14, 2008, 62 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing the LZR Racer."
