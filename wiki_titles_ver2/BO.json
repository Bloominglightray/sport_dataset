        "title": "Spray (sailing vessel)",
        "text": "Spray was the sailboat used by 19th-century Canadian-American seaman and author Joshua Slocum during the first solo circumnavigation of the Earth. Slocum departed Boston Harbor in the 36-foot-9-inch (11.20 m) vessel on April 24, 1895 and returned to Newport, Rhode Island on June 27, 1898, becoming the first person known to have sailed around the world alone. \nSlocum and the \"Spray\" went missing and were never found after departing Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts on November 14, 1909 bound for the headwaters of the Orinoco River in Venezuela.\nHistory.\nIn 1892, Captain Ebenezer Pierce offered Slocum a ship that \"wants some repairs\". Slocum went to Fairhaven, Massachusetts to find that the \"ship\" was a rotting old oyster sloop named \"Spray\", propped up in a field. Despite the major overhaul of the ship, Slocum kept her name \"Spray\", noting, \"Now, it is a law in Lloyd's that the \"Jane\" repaired all out of the old until she is entirely new is still the \"Jane\".\"\nIts days as a fishing boat, probably as a Chesapeake Bay oysterman, had come to an end by 1885, and it was a derelict, slowly deteriorating hulk sitting in a makeshift ship's cradle in a seaside meadow on Poverty Point in Fairhaven, Massachusetts when Captain Pierce of that town offered it to Joshua Slocum as a gift. Slocum came to Fairhaven to look at \"Spray\", and he undertook to repair and refit it over the next thirteen months. The materials used for the repairs cost $553.62, .\nAfter setting off around the world in 1895, the boom was shortened after it broke, and in 1896 Slocum reduced the height of the mast by 7 feet and the length of the bowsprit by 5 feet while in Buenos Aires. In Port Angosto, Strait of Magellan, \"Spray\" was re-rigged as a yawl by adding a jigger. In 1901 \"Spray\" was an attraction at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.\nSeaworthiness.\nAn analysis by Howard I. Chapelle, curator of maritime history at the Smithsonian Institution and a noted expert on small sailing craft, demonstrated that \"Spray\" was stable under most circumstances but could capsize under some conditions. \nOne of the many theories for the boat's disappearance suggested that her internal ballast may have shifted in a severe knock-down and thus unbalanced her. In his book, \"Captain Joshua Slocum\", Victor Slocum the son of the solo seafarer, wrote that \"the ballast was concrete cement, stanchioned down securely to ensure it against shifting should the vessel be hove on her beam-ends. There was no outside ballast whatsoever. \"Spray\" could have been self-righting if shoved on her beam-ends. A fact that was proven by an experiment on an exact duplicate of the original boat and ballasted just like her. The test boat was hove down with mast flat to the water and when released righted herself.\"\nThe time of 2 years and an endless effort made Spray not only a seagoing sailboat but also the first one to cross the high seas of the world including the Atlantic and the Pacific. Joshua not only replaced the old timber with fresh oak but also increased the freeboard (height of shipside above water) which made Spray more stable than any other fishing boats sailing around the time.\nWhen Commodore John Pflieger pointed out in \"Spray\", the journal of The Slocum Society, that a long keel is harder to go about in and that a boat similar to \"Spray\" foundered on a lee shore on this account, Peter Tangvald, who circumnavigated in his 32-foot cutter \"Dorothea I\", replied, \"How much more should Slocum have done to demonstrate that the boat was seaworthy? I would not hesitate to claim that if one \"Spray\" was wrecked on a lee shore it was because her crew needed a few more hours of sailing lessons.\"\nSelf-steering ability.\n\"Spray\" was remarkable for its ability to hold its course for hours or days on end. Sailboat designer John G. Hanna said of \"Spray\", \"I hold that her peculiar merit as a single-hander was in her remarkable balance of all effective centers of effort and resistance on her midship section line,\" but cautioned that \"Spray\" was \"the worst possible boat for anyone lacking the experience and resourcefulness of Slocum.\"\nCipriano Andrade, Jr., an engineer and yacht designer, said of \"Spray\": \"After a thorough analysis of \"Spray\" lines, I found her to have a theoretically perfect balance. Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line.\"\nSlocum himself praised his sloop as \"easily balanced and easily kept in trim.\"\nReplicas.\n\"Spray\" has inspired many boat builders since, including The Spray of Saint-Briac, the boat of the French offshore runner Guy Bernardin."

        "title": "Leonard Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Leonard Barnett Davis (born September 5, 1978) is an American former professional football guard for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was a consensus All-American playing college football for the Texas Longhorns, where he was also a two-time Outland Trophy finalist and a Lombardi Trophy semifinalist. Davis was selected by the Arizona Cardinals with the second overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft. He played for the Cardinals, the Dallas Cowboys - where he was a three-time Pro-Bowler and a second team All-Pro - and the San Francisco 49ers, with whom he went to Super Bowl XLVII. He also spent part of a season with the Detroit Lions, but never took the field for them.\nEarly years.\nLeonard grew up in Wortham, Texas. He is the only child of L.A. and Sammie Lee Davis, but has 21 half-brothers and half-sisters (L.A. had 11 children from a previous marriage, while Sammie Lee had 10 children from a previous marriage).\nDavis attended Wortham High School, where he led his Bulldogs basketball team to the state championship in 1997. In football, he was a Parade All-American and USA Today first-team All-American playing defense and offense for a school with fewer than 150 students. Davis also lettered in track.\nCollege career.\nDavis received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Austin, arriving in John Mackovic's final season, with the intention of playing at defensive tackle and even started three games at that position. He was moved to the offensive line after Mack Brown was named the new head coach. He played left tackle in his last two years.\nDuring his career, Davis blocked for three consecutive 1000-yard rushers in Hodges Mitchell, then Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, who set the college career rushing record. He was second team All-Big 12 in his junior season. Following his senior season in 2000, Davis was a first-team All-Big 12 selection, and a consensus first-team All-American. He was also a finalist for the Outland Trophy on two occasions and a semifinalist for the Lombardi Trophy.\nDavis was UT's fifth top-two pick in draft history and its first since Kenneth Sims went No. 1 in 1982. He was named to the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 2016.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Cardinals.\nDavis was selected second overall in the 2001 NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals, and was named the starter at right guard as a rookie. He came in 4th for the NFL AP Offensive Rookie of the Year at the end of the season. The next year injuries on the offensive line forced the team to move him to right tackle. He was moved back to guard in 2003.\nIn 2004, after Dennis Green was named the new head coach, he was moved to left tackle where he would remain for three seasons, even though he struggled at the position and was one of the highest penalized players in the league.\nOn February 17, 2007, the Cardinals told Davis that they would not name him a franchise or transition player, clearing him to become an unrestricted free agent.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn March 4, 2007, Davis signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a seven-year, $49.6 million contract with $18.75 million guaranteed, who were looking to replace the retired Marco Rivera. At the time, the contract was criticized in the media, for the amount of salary cap space being assigned to a player who would play guard and who had an average performance in previous years. According to \"Forbes\", Davis was the highest-paid NFL player and 19th overall athlete in the 12-month period ending in June 2007, earning $25.4 million.\nDavis was named the starter at right guard and would flourish in Dallas by going to the Pro Bowl in his first three seasons. He had an exceptional year in 2007, as he received Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors for the first time in his career. The Cowboys finished 13-3 and won the NFC East division, but suffered a disappointing first round playoff loss against the New York Giants (who would go on to win the Super Bowl).\nIn 2009, the Cowboys again won the division and also won their first playoff game in 13 seasons.\nDavis was released on July 28, 2011, due to declining play and the team's lack of salary cap room.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn November 7, 2011, he signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Lions. After joining the team midway through the season, he was declared inactive for every game with the Lions.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn July 26, 2012, Davis signed a one-year deal with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent. He was a backup and was a part of the team that reached Super Bowl XLVII. In the game, he played 6 plays on special teams, but the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34–31.\nPersonal life.\nDavis is the bassist in the heavy metal band Free Reign with former Cowboys' teammates Marc Colombo and Cory Procter with guitarist Justin Chapman.\nHis older half-brother Charlie Davis played defensive tackle in the NFL and the USFL.\nDavis now coaches at Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona."

        "title": "Chris Hanson (American football)",
        "text": "Christopher David Hanson (born October 25, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a punter for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Marshall Thundering Herd, and was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 1999. He also played professionally for the Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars, New Orleans Saints and New England Patriots. Hanson is perhaps best known for a season-ending injury sustained while swinging a motivational axe in the Jaguars' locker room in 2003. Hanson was a switch-punter, able to effectively kick with both his left and his right leg, which he alternated to reduce fatigue.\nEarly years.\nHanson attended East Coweta High School in Sharpsburg, Georgia, where he played place kicker, punter, and receiver for head coach Danny Cronic.\nCollege career.\nHanson attended Marshall University and was a four-year letterman in football as a punter. He finished his college football career with an average of 39.9 yards per punt. Hanson helped lead the Thundering Herd to the 1996 NCAA Division I-AA national championship.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nHanson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Cleveland Browns following the 1999 NFL draft. He was waived by the team following training camp.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Green Bay Packers signed Hanson on September 1, 1999. After punting for the Packers in their regular season opener, Hanson was released by the team and re-signed to the team's practice squad. He was waived from the Packers' practice squad on October 12, 1999.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn December 29, 1999, Hanson signed to the Miami Dolphins' practice squad, but released from it the next day. He was later re-signed to a future contract for the 2000 season. He was allocated to the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe for the spring. After suffering an injury in the Dragons' season finale, Hanson was placed on injured reserve by the Dolphins on August 22, 2000. He was released by the Dolphins on August 14, 2001.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nFour days after being waived by the Dolphins, Hanson signed for the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 18, 2001. He played in every game for the Jaguars in 2001, finishing sixth in the NFL in punt yard average. After being re-signed in the offseason, Hanson posted an NFL-best 44.2 gross punt average in 2002, earning his first Pro Bowl election. Hanson nearly matched his average during the first nine games of the 2003 season, posting a 43.5 yard average in that period. Later in the year, Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio placed a wooden stump and axe in the locker room as a symbol of his theme advising players to \"keep choppin' wood\". After his teammates took swings at the wood with the axe, Hanson followed and ended up seriously wounding his non-kicking foot. He was placed on injured reserve on October 10, keeping him out the rest of the season.\nHanson returned for the 2004 season, posting a 42.8 gross punting average over 16 games. Hanson was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month in September 2005, with four punts downed inside the 20-yard line during that period. He helped the Jaguars to a 12–4 record, and a trip to the 2005 Wild-Card playoffs. However, Hanson's gross average dropped in 2006 to 40.6, and the Jaguars decided to draft a punter, Adam Podlesh, in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL draft. Hanson was released by the Jaguars shortly after the draft, on May 1, 2007.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nHanson was signed by the New Orleans Saints on May 7, 2007, but released by the team during cutdowns on August 28, 2007.\nNew England Patriots.\nIn their 2007 training camp, the Patriots' punting competition appeared to be between veteran Josh Miller and first-year player Danny Baugher. By late August, the team had released Miller, leaving only Baugher on the roster. Baugher too was released days later, with the Patriots signing Hanson to replace him. Hanson had a 41.4 punting average for the Patriots in 2007. He helped lead the 2007 Patriots to a 16–0 regular season record, an AFC Championship, and a trip to Super Bowl XLII. In 2008, Hanson finished with a 43.7 punt average and was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week in Week 17, averaging 45 yards a punt in wind gusts up to 60 mph. Hanson finished the 2009 season with a 39.7 punt average, helping the Patriots win the 2009 AFC East Division title.\nNew England did not resign Hanson for the 2010 season, leaving him as a free agent.\nCoaching.\nHanson was named head football coach at Trinity Christian School (Sharpsburg, Georgia) in 2011 after spending one year as an assistant under his former high school coach, Danny Cronic."

        "title": "2005 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2005 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the National Rugby League's 2005 Telstra Premiership season. It was played on the night of Sunday, 2 October at Sydney's Telstra Stadium between the Wests Tigers and North Queensland Cowboys, with both clubs making their grand final debuts. The Wests Tigers won the match 30–16 to claim their first premiership title, becoming the first joint-venture club to win a premiership. Scott Prince of the Wests Tigers received the Clive Churchill Medal as the official man of the match. The game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001.\nBackground.\nThe 2005 NRL season was the 98th season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the eighth run by the National Rugby League. The lineup of clubs remained unchanged from the previous year, with fifteen teams contesting the 2005 Telstra Premiership. The fourth-placed Wests Tigers and fifth-placed North Queensland Cowboys had both reached their first premiership decider. The two teams had met three times during the season, with North Queensland winning by 44–20 in round six, though the Wests Tigers went in having won the previous two, including a 50–6 victory in the first week of the finals series.\nWests Tigers.\nThe Wests Tigers played in their first grand final in their sixth season. Only centre Paul Whatuira and full-back Brett Hodgson had previously played in a grand final. Whatuira won with Penrith in 2003, while Hodgson had lost with Parramatta in 2001. The Wests Tigers had no State of State of Origin representative players in their team. However, their fullback, Brett Hodgson was the 2005 regular season's top point-scorer with 250 points, however he would have a remarkable finals series scoring 58 points, and finished the 2005 season with 308 points in 28 matches.\nThe Wests Tigers went into the game as favourites to win, after comprehensively defeating the North Queensland Cowboys in week one of the finals, 50–6, then defeating the Brisbane Broncos 34–6 in week two of the finals, and then upsetting the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the preliminary final 20–12.\nNorth Queensland Cowboys.\nFor the North Queensland Cowboys, their grand final debut had come at the end of their eleventh season. North Queensland five-eighth Johnathan Thurston, the 2005 season's Dally M Medallist, had won the previous year's grand final with Canterbury as a utility player and replacement player for their injured captain Steve Price. Also, winger Matt Sing lost in 2000 with the Sydney Roosters. Their fullback Matt Bowen was the 2005 regular season's top try scorer. However their Queensland State of Origin forward Carl Webb was suspended for punching Melbourne Storm's Ryan Hoffman in the final round of the regular season, so he was forced to watch the entire Cowboys' finals run from the sidelines. Airline Qantas added an extra two flights and the \"Townsville Bulletin\" newspaper chartered a Boeing 747 to take North Queensland fans to their team's first grand final.\nTeams.\nWests Tigers winger Pat Richards was in doubt for the match with a fractured ankle that eventually required six pain-killing injections for him to take place in the team, defying medical opinion.\nMatch details.\nThe grand final was played at Sydney's Telstra Stadium before a crowd of 82,453. Television coverage of the match was provided by Nine's Wide World of Sports with commentary from Ray Warren, Peter Sterling, Paul Vautin, Phil Gould, Matthew Johns, Andrew Voss and Ben Ikin. The Veronicas and Pete Murray provided pre-match performances. A minute's silence was then held for the previous day's 2005 Bali bombings before Natalie Bassingthwaighte sung the Australian national anthem.\nFirst half.\nAt 19:00 AEST, Tim Mander, officiating his second grand final, blew time on and the Wests Tigers kicked off. In the eighth minute, North Queensland had almost reached the Tigers' 20-metre line on the third tackle of the set when Aaron Payne ran from dummy half and passed inside for Paul Rauhihi to hit the ball up and stand in the tackle, offloading to Jonathan Thurston who passed to Matt Bowen. Bowen then threw a deft pass back on the inside to Justin Smith who charged toward the line and threw the ball blindly back over his head before being tackled. The loose ball was picked up by Thurtson and handed to Bowen to dash the remaining few metres to the line and touch down behind the uprights. For the third week in a row, Bowen was the first try scorer of the game. Josh Hannay converted the try so North Queensland were leading 6–0. Ten minutes later the Wests Tigers were down at the opposition's end of the field where halfback Scott Prince on the last tackle put up a kick that came down over the try line and was taken by Paul Bowman who was about to be tackled in goal and threw a speculative pass which was not caught by his teammate. Wests Tigers forward Bryce Gibbs was there to fall onto the loose ball near the goal posts. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the scores were even at 6-6. North Queensland winger Ty Williams crossed the Wests Tigers try-line in the 23rd minute, but the video referee ruled no try due to an obstruction in back play. A few minutes later, Tigers' left winger Pat Richards crossed in the corner but the video referee disallowed the try as the ball was not properly grounded. \nIn the 35th minute the Wests Tigers received a Johnathan Thurston kick on their own try line, the ball going to Benji Marshall who ran with it, splitting the defence and charging down the left side and over the half-way line. Drawing a defender, Marshall then threw a flick pass behind his back to his winger Pat Richards coming through in support. Richards palmed off a North Queensland defender as he ran the remaining 20 metres to dive over and score, finishing one of the most famous grand final plays in history. Hodgson kicked the extra two points so now the Wests Tigers were leading 12–6. Shortly before half time the North Queensland side were penalised on their 20-metre line and Hodgson took the kick at goal but missed.\nAustralian electronic rock band Rogue Traders performed during the half time break.\nSecond half.\nIn the fifth minute after the break, Wests were mounting an attack 10 metres from the North Queensland line when on the third tackle, hooker Robbie Farah put his prop forward Anthony Laffranchi through a gap to crash over the line and score near the uprights.\nBrett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the Tigers were leading 18–6. Ten minutes later North Queensland were attacking the Wests try line when Thurston, 10 metres out flicked the ball back to Travis Norton who charged over to score.\nJosh Hannay converted the try so North Queensland were behind 18–12. In the 63rd minute the Tigers had the ball down near North Queensland's try-line and moved it out to Daniel Fitzhenry on the right wing to dive over in the corner. Hodgson kicked the goal from near the sideline to convert the try, taking the Tigers' lead out to 24–12.\nWith just over six minutes remaining, Wests Tigers half-back Scott Prince attempted a field goal but missed. Shortly after that North Queensland winger Matt Sing almost scored a try but the video referee found that he'd knocked on. A few minutes later though, the North Queensland side were down close to the Wests Tigers try line where their half-back Johnathan Thurston threw a cut out pass to Matt Sing to score on the right wing.\nJosh Hannay missed the conversion so the score was 24–16 in favour of the Wests Tigers with under two minutes left to play. Seconds before the final siren the Wests Tigers got one more try when Hodgson, from ten metres out, put a grubber kick into North Queensland's in-goal area for Todd Payten to dive onto. Hodgson then converted the try so the final score was 30–16, and the Wests Tigers had their first premiership as a merged team.\nFor fans of Balmain Tigers and Western Suburbs Magpies, the premiership victory also ended long droughts for both sets of fans who came together to support the merged club. Balmain had not won the premiership since 1969 and Western Suburbs had not won since 1952.\nWests Tigers captain Scott Prince, himself from North Queensland, was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as man-of-the-match before being presented with the premiership trophy by Australian Prime Minister John Howard. It was the final match with the Tigers for their winger Pat Richards who joined English Super League club Wigan Warriors for the 2006 season.\nThe match had the highest television ratings for a night time grand final in history. As winners of the grand final the Wests club received $400,000 in prize money.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\n2006 World Club Challenge.\nHaving won the NRL grand final, Wests had earned the right to play against 2005's Super League X Champions, the Bradford Bulls in the following February's World Club Challenge."

Eddy Merckx was attempting to win his sixth Tour de France, but became a victim of violence. Many French spectators were upset that a Belgian might beat the record of five wins set by France's Jacques Anquetil.

After Merckx subsequently fell and broke his cheekbone, he was unable to challenge Thévenet, who went on to win the Tour with Merckx second.\nBelgian cyclists were successful in the secondary classifications: the points classification was won by Rik Van Linden, mountains classification by Lucien Van Impe, and the intermediate sprints classification by Marc Demeyer.

Merckx' first part of the season had been going well, winning Milan–San Remo, the Tour of Flanders and Liège–Bastogne–Liège.\nIf Merckx would win again, he would beat Jacques Anquetil and become the first cyclist to win the Tour six times. Merckx did not care about that record: \"The idea doesn't interest me very much because then people would want me to go for a seventh and then an eighth\".\nA few months before the race, Merckx was unsure if he would start the Tour. His race schedule had been very busy, and he thought riding the Giro and the Tour in the same year would not work. Merckx preferred to ride the Tour, but his Italian team preferred the Giro.\nBernard Thévenet contracted shingles during the 1975 Vuelta a España, but recovered and won the Dauphiné Liberé.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1975 Tour de France started on 26 June, and had two rest days, the first in Auch the second after the finish on the Puy de Dôme, during which the cyclists were transferred to Nice. The 1975 Tour de France did not include a team time trial for the first time since 1962. After 1975, it would be included again every year until 1995. The final stage had become more popular over the years, and the Tour organisers therefore moved the finish line from the Vélodrome de Vincennes to the more prestigious Champs-Élysées. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nFrancesco Moser won the prologue, and kept the lead until the first time trial. Merckx started the Tour aggressively, which caused the peloton to split in two groups in the first stage. Eddy Merckx and Moser were in the first group, and won a minute on most of their competitors. In the second part of the first stage, the field split again, but this time Thevenet and Poulidor were also in the first group.\nIn stage six, a time trial, Merckx beat Moser and became the leader.\nThe first climbing was done in the tenth stage, but the favourites stayed together, and the general classification was not changed.\nThe major Pyrenéan mountains were scheduled in stage eleven. In that stage, Bernard Thévenet and Joop Zoetemelk escaped together, while Merckx could not follow them. Zoetemelk won, with Merckx almost one minute behind. From this point on only Thevenet, Lucien Van Impe, Zoetemelk and Merckx had a realistic chance of winning the maillot jaune as the other favourites finished much later, and lost their hopes of winning the Tour. The fourteenth stage had its finish on top of the Puy de Dôme. When Merckx was about to catch Joop Zoetemelk, a French spectator punched Merckx in the stomach. Zoetemelk did not capitalize and gain time on Merckx because of this as they crossed the finish line with the same time 0:49 behind stage winner Van Impe, who did win some time over the rest of the field together with Thevenet who came in a few seconds behind Van Impe.\nAfter the rest day, the fifteenth stage would end in Pra-Loup. Merckx was still the leader, and escaped from the rest. But on the final climb, Merckx was out of energy, and Thévenet was able to reach Merckx two kilometres from the finish, leave Merckx behind, and win with a margin of two minutes. Trying to follow Gimondi on a downhill, the team car of Bianchi went off the road, falling 150 meters down a cliff. The mechanic separated from the car, landed in a tree and survived. Thévenet was the new leader, and improved his margin in the sixteenth stage by winning with more than two minutes on Merckx.\nWhile riding to the start of the seventeenth stage, Merckx collided with Ole Ritter, and broke a cheekbone. Merckx' broken cheekbone gave him problems with eating, and the Tour doctor gave him the advice to abandon the race. Merckx decided to stay in the race, because of the prize money for his teammates that his second place in the general classification and other classifications would earn them.\nDoping.\nAfter every stage in the 1975 Tour de France, the leader of the race, the winner of the stage and the runner-up, and two random cyclists were checked. In total, 110 tests were done, of which three returned positive, Régis Delépine (after stage 5), Felice Gimondi and José-Luis Viejo (both after stage 15). All three were fined with 1000 Swiss Francs, received one month suspended sentence, were set back to the last place in the stage where they tested positive, and received 10 minutes penalty time in the general classification. This meant that Gimondi, who initially finished the Tour in fifth place, was set back to the sixth place.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1975 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. Time bonuses for stage winners were removed for the 1975 Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification. 1975 was the first year that the leader of the classification wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe combination classification was removed, and the young rider classification was added. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only neo-professionals were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1975, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Merckx won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Télégraphe on stage 17. This prize was won by Luis Balagué.\nAftermath.\nLater, Merckx said that his decision to stay in the Tour after he broke his cheekbone was stupid. He felt that it cut his career short. He said that, instead of worrying about sharing his prize money with his teammates, he should have just paid them out of his own pockets.\nThevenet later confessed that he had used cortisones in 1975."

        "title": "John Gilchrist (basketball)",
        "text": "John Henry Gilchrist III, (born June 29, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player. He is a former Maryland Terrapins point guard.\nCollege.\nArriving in College Park for the 2002–03 season, Gilchrist had a freshman campaign as a backup to then-Terp guards Drew Nicholas and Steve Blake. Following Blake's graduation, Gilchrist inherited the starting point guard position as a sophomore, leading the team in assists (5.0 pg), scoring (15.4 pg), minutes (34.0 pg), and steals (1.8 pg), while starting 30 of 32 games. For his efforts, Gilchrist was named the Terps' Co-Player of the Year.\nHowever, Gilchrist's true coming-out party would be the 2004 ACC Tournament. Having slipped to 7–9 in the ACC—the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade—Maryland was not as highly regarded as in years past and wound up as the tournament's 6th seed. However, the Terps ultimately upset the tournament's top three seeds, knocking off Wake Forest (3), NC State (2), and Duke (1), to win their first ACC Tournament title in 20 years.\nDuring this run, Gilchrist dazzled as the Terps' primary offensive option. First, Gilchrist hit the game-winning free throw against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, scoring 16 points and shooting 4-for-4 from 3-point range. Next, Gilchrist led a 21-point comeback against the NC State Wolfpack, scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime (and shooting 9-for-9 from the field); the 30-point performance was the first for a Terp since Juan Dixon scored 33 points against the Kansas Jayhawks in the 2002 NCAA Final Four.\nBut Gilchrist was saving his best for last. In the tournament final against Duke—a team bound for the 2004 Final Four and loaded with six future NBA players—Gilchrist led the Terps back from a 12-point deficit with less than five minutes left in the game. Most dramatically, Gilchrist closed the 2nd half with a driving layup that drew a fifth and final foul on Shelden Williams, Duke's best low-post presence and Gilchrist's main competition for tournament MVP. Gilchrist's ensuing foul shot would tie the game at 77 with 20 seconds left, and Maryland went on to dominate the overtime and secure a 95–87 victory. For his three-day heroics, Gilchrist was unanimously named tournament MVP. The win also snapped Duke's drive for a sixth consecutive ACC Tournament title, while propelling Maryland into the 2004 NCAA tournament; though the Terps ultimately lost by a few points to Syracuse in the second round, the team was seen as an up-and-coming squad that had overachieved, despite its youth.\nHowever, Gilchrist's career at Maryland—and fans' and NBA scouts' glowing opinion of him—would never reach these heights again. Led by their junior point guard, the Terps entered the 2004–2005 season ranked in the top 15 in the nation, but would succumb to road struggles and a late season collapse to again finish 7–9 in the conference. Nor could the team summon 2004's magic in the 2005 ACC Tournament; the Terps lost in the first round to Clemson, the third time the Tigers defeated the Terps that year. With a middling 16–12 record, Maryland missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 13 years and accepted a consolation trip to the NIT, where they lost in the semifinals to South Carolina.\nProfessional.\nDespite having the physical tools (6 ft 3 in 194 lb.) of a solid NBA point guard and skills and athleticism that drew comparisons to an early Stephon Marbury, Gilchrist went undrafted, as most felt his mental maturity lagged far behind his physical maturity. He was invited to play in the Cleveland Cavaliers' summer league, but was not picked up by the team.\nMaccabi Rishon LeZion, 2005–2006.\nIn October 2005, he signed with the Maccabi Rishon Letzion, an Israeli pro team, he helped in leading his team to the Israeli Final Four where they finished in the 3rd place.\nPau-Ortez, Ironi Nahariya and NBDL, 2006–2007.\nIn the summer of 2006 Gilchrist signed with the Euroleague French team Pau Orthez but was released shortly and moved back to Israel, to Ironi Naharia. Gilchrist remained inconsistent during the season, and was again released in January 2007.\nGilchrist was picked up as the 66th pick in the 5th round by the Los Angeles D-Fenders in the NBDL (NBA development league) in February 2007. John Gilchrist played for the D-Fenders through March, then moved to the Idaho Stampede (another NBDL team) in April.\nLatvia and return to Ironi Nahariya, 2007–2008.\nIn August 2007 Gilchrist signed one-year contract with Latvian runners-up BK Ventspils, but in November 2007 was released. After a few weeks, Gilchrist returned to play for Israel's Ironi Naharya.\nAdelaide 36ers, 2009–2010.\nIn July 2009 it was reported he would be joining the Adelaide 36ers from the Australian NBL. In his first game, against the Cairns Taipans, Gilchrist scored 20 points and added 10 rebounds and 6 assists. On October 29, 2009, Gilchrist scored an NBL career-high 26 points in a 99–91 loss to the New Zealand Breakers. He suffered a serious knee injury towards the end of the season.\nB.K. Prishtina, 2011–2012.\nJohn Gilchrist bounced back from a knee injury to a strong return to Kosovo playing Sigal Prishtina from the Kosovo Basketball League to make all league honors of Eurobasket.com.\nDarkhan Garid, 2014–2015.\nGilchrist had inked a deal with Darkhan Gaird from Mongolia in 2014."

        "title": "Rugby High School for Girls",
        "text": "Rugby High School is a selective grammar school situated in the Bilton area of Rugby, Warwickshire, England. The school motto is “She Sets Heights In Her Heart”. It takes girls aged 11–18 and boys 16–18. To attend this school, all students must have scored highly in the Eleven plus exam. It is the only state school in Warwickshire to offer Latin as a subject. In January 2023, it was rated \"Good\" by Ofsted.\nAdmissions.\nTo be accepted into the school, pupils must currently take the Eleven plus exam. Candidates who live in Rugby must come in the top 120 girls and candidates who live in the wider catchment area (10 miles from the rugby water tower) must come within the top 60.\nIt caters purely for female students from Year 7 – 13 and as of the start of the 2018 Academic Year takes boys Year 12 – 13. This was in response to competing school Lawrence Sheriff accepting both male and female students into their sixth form.\nIn the 11–16 age range, the school has a four-form intake. Each year group numbers roughly 120 girls. At post 16, pupils from many other schools join the current pupils at Rugby High School to create a year group that is around double the size of 11–16 year groups.\nHistory.\nOlive Hands.\nOlive Hands was born in Rugby. After attending the University of London, she became a teacher at a school in Bromyard. She decided, at the age of 27, that girls of Rugby should be given the opportunity for a first class education. She borrowed money to set up a private school in 1903 in adjoining houses at 10 and 12 Elsee Road. It was named the Arnold High School. Later a preparatory department for younger girls was opened and this had 50 pupils by 1910. By 1909 the school had been expanded by linking it to 12 Elsee Road and there were a total of 114 pupils. By 1914 the preparatory department had moved to Eastfield House (now the Masonic Hall ). In 1916 there were 91 pupils in each half of the school.\nThe County School.\nThe 1918 Education Act gave the county council responsibility for secondary education. In 1919 the W.C.C. was in the process of buying the Clifton Road site when Miss Hands decided she had to close her school. This was the only girls school in Rugby with moderate fees so the council decided it had to take over. In 1919 Miss M.M. Skues was appointed as the first council headmistress. There were 195 girls on the roll and the Elsee Road houses could hold 130. In 1921 the Clifton Road site came into use as the school playing field, replacing a rented field in Bilton Road. In 1926 Miss Skues retired and Miss Glenday took over 140 pupils in the upper school and 40 in the lower.\nRugby High School for Girls – Clifton Road.\nThe foundation stone was laid on 2 October 1924 and the upper school moved in for the Autumn term 1927, when 'Arnold' was dropped from the name. At this point only the main assembly hall and the East quadrangle had been built and was not really large enough for the 168 girls using it. Building of the West quadrangle did not start until 1931 and was finished for September 1932. There was now room for the Preparatory department to move to the new site from Eastfield House. When Miss Glenday left to join Clifton High School, Bristol in 1933 there were 300 pupils and 19 teachers at Clifton Road. The new headmistress was Miss Briselden. In 1944 the Education Act prompted the closing of the Preparatory Department. There was no 5 year old entry that year and in 1949 the last year of girls reached 11. The spare space let the upper school increase its intake to 3 forms per year from 1944. In 1955 Miss D.M. Lindsley became headmistress and a month later it was announced that the school was going to move sites again. The Technical College was being split to form an Engineering College and a College of Further Education. The latter college was to take over the school buildings. The High School moved to its present buildings in Longrood Road, Bilton in September 1960.\nCompetitions.\nThe school took part in the \"Top of the Form\" competition, recorded on 27 September 1951 against Wolverhampton Boys School, who they beat by 30-20. It was broadcast on Monday 8 October 1951, repeated at 9.30am on Saturday 13 October 1951. On Monday 26 November 1951 a competition was recorded against Bolton boys school, who they beat by 1 point, getting to the England final against Beckenham and Penge School for Boys, broadcast on December 3 1951, with Diana Higgins 17, Helen Compton 14, Jocelyn Milner 13, and Elizabeth Edmundson 12. The team won the England final 27-19. In the semi-final the team was beaten 25-31 by St Dominic's Grammar School for Girls of Belfast, broadcast on Monday 31 December 1951. Jocelyn was the grand-daughter of physicist Samuel Milner FRS, and her father Chris, a physicist, worked at BTH in Rugby during the war, and briefly for the Manhattan Project in 1944 at University of California, Berkeley.\nHouses.\nThe school introduced a house system during the academic year 2001 - 2002. The current houses are named after Onjali Raúf, founder of Making Herstory and an author, Dame Kelly Holmes, an athlete, Mary Seacole, a British-Jamaican Nurse and Evelyn Glennie, a deaf percussionist – the initials of which stand for RHSG (Rugby High School for Girls). These names were changed in September 2021 with the previous house names coming from Sue Ryder, Barbara Hepworth, Helen Sharman and Evelyn Glennie. Initially there were only three houses with the initials RHS after the shortened for of Rugby High School but from September 2016 a fourth house was introduced named after Evelyn Glennie, an inspirational woman who was voted for by students. The initial of 'G' stands for the 'Girls' in 'Rugby High School for Girls'. The houses are assigned to whole form groups, and they can gain house points by taking part in various school events, such as the annual Sports Day, interform sports, or Pink Day (in support of Cancer Research UK). Each form is given the initial of their house, to come before the initial of their form tutor, e.g. 8R, is a Year 8 form, in Raúf House. The system is not very different from the interform system previously in place, with students in the same form all being placed within the same house. However, the house system has created a link between different year groups and has encouraged wider participation in school events other than the interform.\nThe original houses, in use at least up to 1979, were named after Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, Charlotte Brontë/Emily Brontë/Anne Brontë, Edith Cavell, Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale and Queen Margaret. These were all named after strong women. Each form had some members of each house. There were inter-house sports competitions and a music competition. House points were awarded for consistently good work in a particular subject – three A's in a row as well as mentions on a termly sheet. These could be negative (unsatisfactory) as well as several grades of positive. The points were totalled and a shield awarded.\nThe school also has a 6th Form Entertainment, produced by the year 13 students – sometimes with assistance from the staff – at the end of the Autumn term. This tradition was suspended for several years after a script was deemed to be offensive to members of the staff. It was resurrected in The academic year 2004–2005, with greater involvement and participation from the staff. The new format the entertainment took was of a variety show, with music and dancing displays, followed by a panto-like skit. The skit is often based around a famous story or event, but with students playing the roles of teachers. Previous years included Cinderella (1999), Big Brother (2000), The Wizard of Oz (2001) and The Sound of Music (2005). Each Christmas, there is also a Decorated Classrooms competition, where students take a theme and decorate their classrooms, often acting out performances while being judged.\nUniform.\nThe school uniform was changed in September 2011. The previous uniform was, for years 7–9, a pale blue polo shirt with a navy blue sweatshirt and navy blue trousers/skirt, for years 10–11 a white or pale blue shirt with a navy blue V-Neck jumper and navy blue trousers/skirt and for Sixth form, office dress.\nThe new uniform consists of a navy blue blazer with navy blue trousers/skirt and navy blue V-neck jumper or tank top. Years 7–9 should wear a pale blue shirt and years 10–11 should wear a white shirt with blue stripes.\nFrom September 2013, there will be a new sixth form uniform. Students should wear matching trousers/skirt with a matching jacket in a suit style with any smart shirt of their choice.\nAlso, after Summer 2016, there will be a new PE- Kit consisting of blue and House colours. Raúf is yellow, Holmes is Red, Seacole is Green and Glennie is Purple\nFrom September 2017, there is a change to the blazers, changing the crest from the previous logo (RHS in a circle) to the new one (a lime green 'R' with Rugby High School Written below in white). These new blazers are 'Eco' blazers made from recycled plastic bottles\nOld Girls' Society.\nThe Old Girls’ Society was formed in October 1922. In addition to the summer reunions, there was a flourishing Old Girls Dramatic Society, and a Hockey Club. For several years, an Old Girls’ Dance was held at Christmas time but support for these events eventually dwindled and so from 1959 until 1963, the Society ceased to exist. When it was revived in 1963, Cheese and Wine parties, theatre parties and Coffee evenings were organized to attract members, for many members of the Old Girls lived in Rugby. Each year, money was raised for charities including the Margery Fry Trust for ex-prisoners, Lifeline, Multiple Sclerosis Society, Schizophrenia Society, the Hoskyn Centre and other charities.\nThe Society presented a music stool and engraved outdoor seat to mark the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the school in 1979. Church services have taken place on the special anniversaries of the school and trees have been planted at the school. Funds were raised by the Old Girls to buy a table and chair for the platform in the School Hall in memory of Miss Briselden (a former Headmistress) after her death in 1992. The Society also raised funds towards the £2000 needed to help provide furnishings and musical equipment for the Alexander Youngman Music Centre.\nShirley Wallbank has provided musical entertainment for the reunion on several occasions and Pat Petrie wrote a play portraying her schooldays (1949–1954). There was no shortage of Old Girls then to dress up in the navy tunics, square-necked blouses and the pudding basin hats that they hated when at school!\nThe biggest Fund raising was to restore the tiled Art Deco panel which had been rescued from the Clifton Road school just before it was demolished in 1995. The panel showing Joan of Arc can now be found on the foyer wall at the Rugby Library.\nAt present, the Society meets for the annual reunion in May at Rugby High School."

        "title": "1929 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1929 Tour de France was the 23rd edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 30 June to 28 July. It consisted of 22 stages over .\nNicolas Frantz had won two consecutive Tours, in 1927 and 1928, and was looking for a third. In addition the 1926 Tour winner, Lucien Buysse, was looking for another title.\nVictor Fontan, leader of the general classification and therefore wearer of the yellow jersey, crashed in the Pyrenees during stage 10, breaking the forks to his bicycle. At that time, a rule stated that a rider must finish a stage with the bike he started it with. Fontan went house to house, looking for a bike to borrow. He eventually found one and rode 145 km to the finish line, with his broken bike strapped to his back. At the end of the day Fontan quit the race in tears. The rule was removed for the 1930 Tour de France.\nThe Tour was won by Belgian Maurice De Waele, although he was sick during the race. The Tour organisation was not content with the outcome of the race, because the strongest team Alycon had been able to deliver the winner even though he was sick, so they changed the rules after the 1929 Tour de France, and for the next years there were no sponsored teams but only national or regional teams.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1928, many stages were in the team-time-trial format, where the teams started separately. The Tour organisation had invented this rule to make the flat stages more competitive, but it had the effect that the public stopped following the race. Therefore, in 1929 the most stages were run in the normal format, except for stages 12, 19 and 20, the stages that were expected to be raced slower than 30 km/h.&gt;\nThe entire podium in 1928 was occupied by members from the Alcyon cycling team. The tour organisation wanted the Tour to be an individual race, so in 1929 the teams were officially not there, and riders started in the A-category (professional cyclists) or as touriste-routiers (semi-professional or amateur).\nIn 1928, cyclist could be helped when they had a flat tire; in 1929 this rule was reversed, and cyclists had to fix their flat tires by themselves.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stages, the cyclists remained close to each other. Aimé Dossche won the first stage, and kept the lead for the next two stages. In the fourth stage, Maurice De Waele and Louis De Lannoy escaped from the bunch. De Lannoy won the stage, while Dewaele took over the lead in the general classification.\nIn the seventh stage, De Waele had two flat tires, and was not in the first group. Three man from that first group now shared the lead. There was no rule for this situation, so all three cyclists were given the yellow jersey in the next stage.\nIn stage eight, this situation was solved, as Gaston Rebry took over the lead.\nIn the ninth stage, the first mountain stage, Lucien Buysse, the winner of the 1926 Tour de France and now racing as a touriste-routier, took the lead early in the race, and mounted the Aubisque first. In the descent, De Waele and Victor Fontan caught him. De Waele then punctured and lost eight minutes. Fontan was caught by the Spaniard Salvador Cardona, but his second place in the stage gave him the lead in the general classification. In the tenth stage, after only seven kilometers Fontan broke his fork. Some sources say he hit a dog, others say he fell in a gutter. He is said to have knocked on every door of a small town before he found a replacement bicycle. According to the rules, he had to finish the race with the bicycle he started with, so he strapped the broken bicycle to his back, and rode for 145 through the Pyrenees with a broken bicycle on his back, before he finally gave up.\nAfter that tenth stage, Maurice De Waele was leading the general classification. One hour before the start of the fifteenth stage, he collapsed. The Alcyon team asked for the stage to be started one hour later, which was granted. De Waele was literally dragged on his bicycle, and his teammates rode shoulder-to-shoulder to prevent opponents from attacking. At the end of the stage, his teammates had helped him so much that he had lost only 13 minutes to the winner, finishing in 11th place. In the sixteenth stage, De Waele became better, and only Charles Pélissier could win time on him.\nAfter the race was over, Jef Demuysere received 25 minutes penalty time in the general classification because he had taken drinks where this was not allowed. This moved him from the second place in the general classification to the third place.\nResults.\nIn stages 12, 19 and 20, the cyclists started in teams. The cyclist who reached the finish fastest was the winner of the stage. In the other stages all cyclists started together.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nDuring the 1929 Tour de France, the cyclists did not race in trade teams, but still the cyclists of the same team cooperated.\nOther classifications.\nThe organisers, from the newspaper l'Auto, named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Victor Fontan.\nAftermath.\nAfter Victor Fontan had to give up in the tenth stage because of mechanical problems while he was leading the race, journalist Louis Delblat wrote that the rules should be changed, because a Tour should not be lost because of mechanical problems. Eventually the rule changed, but only after Tour director Henri Desgrange retired.\nThe team-time-trial format, which had been introduced to equalize power between the teams, had completely failed. It was removed for the 1930 Tour de France. Between 1935 and 1937, the concept was seen back, and returned again in 1954.\nHenri Desgrange was angry at the outcome of the race. The strongest trade team decided who the winner was, while Desgrange wanted the strongest individual to win. Immediately after the 1929 Tour de France, he announced that he would drastically change the rules for the 1930 Tour de France. He removed the trade teams completely, and replaced them by national teams.\nThe winner of the race, Dewaele, would never reach his level of 1929 again. In 1931 he ended his Tour de France career with a fifth place."

        "title": "Kevin Martin (basketball, born 1983)",
        "text": "Kevin Dallas Martin Jr. (born February 1, 1983) is an American retired professional basketball player who played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Western Carolina University, where in his junior year, he averaged 24.9 points per game, which ranked second in the nation. After three years at Western Carolina, he entered the 2004 NBA draft and was selected with the 26th overall pick by the Sacramento Kings.\nEarly life.\nMartin was born in Zanesville, Ohio, to Kevin Sr. and Marilyn Martin. He grew up idolizing Michael Jordan. He played for Zanesville High School and was fourth in the voting for Ohio Mr. Basketball as a Senior, finishing behind the first Sophomore winner LeBron James.\nCollege career.\nHe received a full scholarship to Western Carolina University, where he majored in sport management. On November 22, 2002, Martin scored a college career-high 46 points in a loss against Coastal Carolina. On November 21, 2003, Martin scored 44 points in a loss against Georgia. He ranks fourth all-time on Western Carolina's scoring list with 1,838 points. Martin averaged 23.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game during his three years in college.\nProfessional career.\nSacramento Kings (2004–2010).\nMartin was a standout while at Western Carolina. Due to his success, he was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the 26th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft.\nIn the 2004–05 season, Martin averaged 2.9 points, 1.3 rebounds and 0.5 assists per game, and played sparingly, averaging just 10 minutes a game.\nMartin showed much improvement the following year, averaging 10.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.3 assists. Martin also started from time to time during the 2005–06 season in part by the injury of Bonzi Wells. This included a start at small forward due to Ron Artest being suspended for Game Two of the team's first-round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on Manu Ginóbili. He is best known in that series for making the game winning buzzer beater in Game 3 in Sacramento that gave the Kings a 1–2 series against the Spurs. His shot was also over the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan.\nWhen interviewed on a segment by TNT during a game, Martin credited Doug Christie for helping him learn how to defend in the NBA. Likewise, Martin also credited Cuttino Mobley for helping him with his shooting. Martin played behind both guards during their tenure with the Kings.\nIn the general managers' survey at the start of the 2006–07 NBA season, Martin tied for second as the player most likely to have a breakout campaign, behind the Orlando Magic's Dwight Howard. During the 2006–07 season, Martin proved himself to be among the top scorers in the NBA, averaging 20.2 points per game, while averaging 4.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists, all career highs. He is also one of the best shooters in the league with a 47.3% shooting percentage from the field and 38.1% from beyond the three-point arc (along with 84.4% FT shooting). Martin finished second to Monta Ellis in the NBA Most Improved Player Award. Ellis edged Martin by three points in the closest voting in the award's history.\nOn March 17, 2007, Martin led the Kings to a 95–83 road win over the Orlando Magic and joined Nate Archibald as the only other player in NBA history to score at least 20 points in a game with only one field goal made. Martin tallied 20 points on 1-8 FG from the field (1–1 3pt) while knocking down 17-20 FT from the foul line.\nOn August 28, 2007, the Sacramento Kings and Martin agreed to a 5-year, $55 million deal.\nMartin got off to a fast start to the NBA season, while in the first 15 games was the NBA's leading scorer with 29.6 PPG. Martin finished the season 6th in the NBA in scoring at 23.7 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 2.1 APG and averaging 45% from the court and 40% from three-point range. However, he missed 17 games due to a groin injury. Also during the year, on March 7, 2008, Martin scored 48 points in a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nMartin became the leader of the team following the Ron Artest trade during the offseason. He started the season strong, however he suffered an ankle injury which kept him out 15 games. He returned, but re-aggravated his injury shortly thereafter. After returning again, he helped the Kings snap a 6-game losing streak. Martin averaged 24.6 points per game during the remainder of the season, including an overtime loss on April 1, 2009, against the Golden State Warriors, in which he scored a career-high 50 points and became the first King to score 50-plus since Chris Webber in 2001. On November 2, 2009, Martin scored 48 points including 7–10 from three-point range to lead the Kings to an overtime victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.\nHouston Rockets (2010–2012).\nMartin was traded during the 2009–10 season to the Houston Rockets on February 18, 2010, as part of a three-way trade including the New York Knicks and the Sacramento Kings. In his debut as a Rocket, Martin scored just 3–16 from the field, but 8–9 from the line, ending the game with 14 points, in a 125–115 loss to the Indiana Pacers. On April 12, in his first game back in Sacramento's Arco Arena, Martin scored 39 points, scoring 11 of 20, making all 16 of his foul shot attempts.\nOn December 11, 2010, Martin scored 40 points in a 110–95 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers and went on to score a season-high 45 points in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 5, 2011. By the end of the season he averaged 23.5 points per game in 32 minutes per game. Martin shot .383 at the three-point line, and he was also near .900 from free throw range. Martin averaged 7.4 made free throws per game, second in the NBA to only Kevin Durant.\nAfter commissioner David Stern, acting as owner of the New Orleans Hornets at the time, vetoed a three-team deal involving the Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers that would have sent Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragić, and Lamar Odom to New Orleans, he stayed with Houston for the lockout-shortened season. Martin suffered a shoulder injury on February 2. He tried to play through the injury but ended up re-aggravating the injury when he ran into a screen against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 11. An MRI revealed a labral tear in his right shoulder, and he missed the rest of the season. With new rules regarding foul calls, in addition to playing injured, Martin's numbers dropped, averaging just 17.1 points per game, the worst in his career as a full-time starter. While he was still able to make a high percentage of his free throws, he only got to the line about half as often as the previous season.\nOklahoma City Thunder (2012–2013).\nOn October 27, 2012, Martin was traded along with Jeremy Lamb and three future draft picks to the Oklahoma City Thunder for James Harden, Daequan Cook, Lazar Hayward, and Cole Aldrich. In game six of the Western Conference Quarterfinals, Martin scored 25 points in a 103–94 win, as the Thunder eliminated his former team the Houston Rockets.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2013–2016).\nOn July 2, 2013, it was reported Martin had agreed to sign a four-year, $28 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Martin reportedly also received interest from the Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans, and Milwaukee Bucks. On July 11, 2013, he was officially acquired by the Timberwolves as part of a three-team trade involving the Thunder and the Bucks that sent the rights to Szymon Szewczyk to Oklahoma City and Luke Ridnour to Milwaukee. On November 3, 2013, Martin scored 30 points, including 5–5 three-pointers as the Timberwolves defeated the New York Knicks.\nOn November 25, 2014, Martin was sidelined for six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a fracture in his right wrist.\nOn March 1, 2016, Martin was waived by the Timberwolves in a buyout agreement.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2016).\nOn March 9, 2016, Martin signed with the San Antonio Spurs. His best effort as a Spur came on April 8, 2016, when he scored 17 points against the Denver Nuggets. Martin's final appearance came on May 12, 2016, in the Spurs' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 6 of the Western Conference semi-finals; he recorded two rebounds in just under six minutes off the bench.\nRetirement.\nOn November 24, 2016, Martin announced his retirement from the NBA.\nPlayer profile.\nStanding at six feet, seven inches tall and weighing in at 199 pounds, Martin played the shooting guard position. With a career points-per-game average of 17.4, he established himself as one of the most efficient scorers in the NBA. Despite his unorthodox shooting stroke and skinny frame, he made significant contributions offensively. He was also known for his quickness. Martin went to the free throw line frequently and shot a great percentage; he led the NBA in free throws made in 2010–11. He was considered an average defender who had good awareness but lacked strength. In a 2010 interview, Reggie Miller was asked which NBA players reminded him of his own playing style. Miller responded: \"Game-wise I would say Richard Hamilton and Kevin Martin. Thin, great coming off screens, can knock down threes.\"\nPost-playing career.\nOn October 1, 2019, the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League (NBL) announced their new ownership group, which included Martin.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2007, Martin traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa to participate in the Basketball Without Borders Program and Habitat for Humanity. In June 2010, Martin volunteered to donate money to pay for the funeral of Kasey King-Thomas, a six-year-old boy who died in a school bus accident near Martin's hometown. Martin also voiced his support for an Ohio law requiring seat belts in school buses. Martin married Jill Arnold on July 15, 2011, in Clearwater Beach, Florida."

        "title": "John Robinson (American football coach)",
        "text": "John Alexander Robinson (born July 25, 1935) is an American former football coach best known for his two stints as head coach of the University of Southern California (USC) football team (1976–1982, 1993–1997) and for his tenure as head coach of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams (1983–1991). Robinson's USC teams won four Rose Bowls and captured a share of the national championship in the 1978 season. Robinson is one of the few college football head coaches to have non-consecutive tenure at the same school. In 2009, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nJohn Alexander Robinson was born on July 25, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to Provo, Utah at six, and then to Daly City, California at nine, where he attended Catholic parochial school with future Pro Football Hall of Famer John Madden, at Our Lady of Perpetual Help, graduating in 1950, and Junípero Serra High School graduating in 1954.\nCollege career.\nRobinson attended the University of Oregon, where he played Tight End on Oregon's 1958 Rose Bowl team.\nCoaching career.\nOregon.\nRobinson began his coaching career at the University of Oregon, his alma mater, where he served as an assistant coach under Len Casanova and Jerry Frei from 1960 to 1971.\nUSC.\nRobinson then served as USC's offensive coordinator from 1972 to 1974 under head coach John McKay, who had been an assistant coach at Oregon when Robinson played there. During this three-year stretch, the Trojans went 31–3–2, winning three Pac-8 Conference titles and appearing in three Rose Bowls (winning two of them) with a pair of national championships.\nOakland Raiders.\nRobinson then left USC to serve as the Oakland Raiders' running backs coach in 1975, rejoining Madden, who was by then Oakland's head coach. That season, the Raiders went 11–3 and reached the AFC Championship Game, where they lost 16–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nUSC.\nIn 1976, when John McKay left USC to coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Robinson was named to succeed him. Robinson would coach at USC from 1976 to 1982, during which he led the Trojans to three conference titles and five bowl games. He won the Rose Bowl in 1977, 1979, and 1980 and USC earned a national championship in 1979. Following the 1982 season, Robinson stepped down as head coach with a record of 67–14–2 over seven seasons.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nHired to replace Ray Malavasi prior to the 1983 NFL season, John Robinson is considered one of the more successful coaches in Rams history, leading the franchise to the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons and twice reaching the NFC Championship Game. Both of those contests ended in defeat against eventual Super Bowl champions, the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1989 San Francisco 49ers. Robinson's tenure as Rams coach was made more difficult by the fact that the Rams played in the same division as the 49ers, the dominant team of the 1980s (the only time he won the NFC West title during his tenure was 1985). However, he had great success in importing his trademark running game after using the No. 2 overall pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to draft running back Eric Dickerson. In just over four seasons with the Rams, Dickerson ran for 7,245 yards and led the league in rushing three times, with his 1984 total of 2,105 yards still an NFL record going into 2022. After Dickerson was traded midway through the 1987 season, Robinson's Rams still had the league's rushing leader in Charles White, while Greg Bell continued Robinson's running tradition with back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in 1988 and 1989. Additionally, Robinson introduced to the league a group of highly-respected assistant coaches, including Norv Turner, Hudson Houck, and Gil Haskell, all of whom would go on to have long and productive NFL coaching careers.\nFollowing the Rams' 30–3 loss in the 1989 NFC Championship Game, the Rams franchise went into decline. After a 5–11 season in 1990 and a 3–13 mark in 1991, Robinson was fired by the Rams, though his 79 career victories remain the most in franchise history.\nUSC.\nAfter spending several seasons in radio and television broadcasting, Robinson returned to the sidelines in 1993 with USC. In his second stint with the Trojans, the team won three straight bowl games, including the 1996 Rose Bowl. Though Robinson never finished with a losing season at USC, his mark of 37–21–2 (including a 3–6–1 mark against traditional rivals Notre Dame and UCLA in his second stint) led to his dismissal following the 1997 season.\nUNLV.\nTwo years later, Robinson was hired to coach football at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Robinson won his first two games in 1999, the second win coming at Baylor where the Rebels won despite entering the game's final play down by three points and not possessing the ball; the Rebels finished 3–8 in Robinson's first year. The Rebels rebounded to win eight games in 2000, including a 31–14 victory over Arkansas in the Las Vegas Bowl, Robinson's only bowl appearance with the Running Rebels. In 2002, Robinson was chosen as the university's athletic director, but he stepped down from that position a year later to concentrate on the coaching position. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. Despite being relieved of duty as athletic director, he resigned after going 2–9 in his final season in 2004.\nSan Marcos High School.\nIn 2010, Robinson returned to coaching as defensive coordinator at San Marcos High School in San Marcos, California, having never before coached at the high school level. With Robinson's assistance, the Knights went 4–7 and reached the CIF-San Diego Section football playoffs.\nIn July 2019, Robinson joined the LSU football program as a senior consultant to head coach Ed Orgeron. He remained in that position through the 2021 season.\nOutside of coaching.\nRobinson began a three decade long association with Sports USA Radio Network in 1998, and as of January 2018 serves as a color analyst for the network. He is a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott, and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.\nHis son, David Robinson, is a defensive coordinator for the Fullerton College Hornets football program. He had played on Fullerton's 1983 national title team. David worked for his father as an assistant coach, working in six bowl games, most notably the 1995 Cotton Bowl and 1996 Rose Bowl.\nRobinson currently resides in Encinitas, California."

        "text": "James Bradford Hall (born February 4, 1977) is a former American football defensive end. He played in the National Football League (NFL) with the Detroit Lions from 2000 to 2006 and St. Louis Rams from 2007 to 2011. Hall signed for the Lions as an undrafted free agent in 2000. He played college football at the University of Michigan, where he was three-year starter for the Michigan Wolverines and a member of the national championship 1997 team.\nEarly years.\nHall earned All-State honors as senior at St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. after totaling 67 tackles, eight sacks, and one interception as senior.\nCollege career.\nAt the University of Michigan, Hall majored in sports marketing and administration and was a three-year starting defensive end for the Michigan Wolverines. Hall had 185 tackles and 25 sacks in his career. Coming off the bench for 11 games, Hall had 17 tackles and three sacks as a redshirt freshman in 1996. Then in 1997, when Michigan won the AP National Championship Trophy, Hall started 11 out of 12 games played at rush linebacker, with 51 tackles and four sacks. As a junior in 1998, Hall was named to the All-Big Ten Conference second-team with career-highs in tackles (63) and sacks (11). In his senior season of 1999, he was a third-team \"The Sporting News\" All-American, All-Big Ten honorable mention, and Butkus Award semifinalist after making 54 tackles and seven sacks.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Lions.\nHe went undrafted in the 2000 NFL Draft, but signed a three-year deal for $880,000 with the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent.\nIn his rookie season of 2000 he played in five games recording one sack. The following season of 2001 he made 35 tackles and four sacks in 15 appearances. In 2002, he made 49 tackles and recorded two sacks.\nPrior to the 2003 season Hall signed with the Lions a one-year tender for $1.32 million. During that season of 2003, he started 16 games for the first time in his career, finishing the campaign with 59 tackles and 4.5 sacks.\nIn 2004, despite suffering a broken hand on the opening weekend at the Chicago Bears, Hall recorded 48 tackles and a career-high 11.5 sacks. This excellent season led to a renegotiation of Hall's contract. The Lions re-signed Hall to a five-year extension.

After two seasons, he was released but later re-signed by the Rams. Hall would go on to start for rest of his tenure in St.Louis and was fairly productive with Chris Long on the other side. He went on to have 250 combined tackles and 30 sacks in five seasons in St. Louis. He was cut on March 12, 2012."

        "title": "WWE Road to WrestleMania X8",
        "text": "WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 is a professional wrestling video game released on the Game Boy Advance handheld console by THQ in 2002, based on WWE's 2002 pay-per-view WrestleMania X8. The game featured improved gameplay and grappling techniques compared to its predecessors. This game was the Game Boy Advance successor to \"WWF Road to WrestleMania\" from 2001 and was succeeded by \"WWE Survivor Series\" in 2004. It was one of two games named after the event, the other being \"WWE WrestleMania X8\" for the GameCube, released five months prior in June 2002. Of the three WWE games developed by Natsume Co., Ltd. for the Game Boy Advance, \"WWE Road to WrestleMania X8\" was the most successful in regard to both sales and reviews.\nGameplay.\nWith the limited number of buttons on the Game Boy Advance, just \"A\" and \"B\", \"WWE Road to WrestleMania X8\" employed a simple approach to simulating wrestling moves. It has been likened to how \"Fire Pro Wrestling\" based the actions on timed button pressing and strategy. The combination of a button push and a direction choice when the two wrestlers lock up would result in different wrestling moves and also allowed for moves to be reversed if the timing was right. In addition, characters could climb ropes, perform running moves and pick up weapons. The gameplay was seen as an improvement over the \"button mashing\" approach of its predecessor \"WWF Road to WrestleMania\".\nReviewers did point out that the game lacked a \"Create-a-Wrestler\" feature, most likely due to the limited memory of the Game Boy Advance. While the gameplay itself was improved, several reviewers noted that the Artificial Intelligence that controlled the computer opponents was easy and predictable. The AI also had problems during multi-man matches, on occasion attacking their own partner during a game.\nMatch types.\n\"WWE Road to WresteMania X8\" features four different game modes, Exhibition, Championship Mode, pay-per-view mode and Gauntlet mode. The Championship allowed a player to play through a WWE \"Season\" from the day after WrestleMania X-Seven until WrestleMania X8 to challenge for various WWE championship. The pay-per-view mode allowed the player to create a number of matches for a specific WWE PPV to play through. In the Gauntlet mode the player must survive against a set number of opponents, one match at a time. The game allows players to choose standard match options like one versus one, tag team matches as well as options such as lumberjack matches, with other wrestlers around the ring, Hardcore matches where weapons are allowed and even play a fifteen-man version of the Royal Rumble match as well as playing an eight-man King of the Ring tournament. Multiple players could play together, as many a four players if they all have the game cartridge and connect by using the GameLink cable.\nThe roster for the game included only 15 wrestlers (a reduced number from the previous game's 24): Kurt Angle, Booker T, Edge, Christian, Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Hulk Hogan, Chris Jericho, Kane, Kevin Nash. Rob Van Dam, The Rock, Triple H, Test and the Undertaker. Of the 15 wrestlers selected for the game only Kevin Nash had not actually wrestled at WrestleMania X8, but did appear on the show as he accompanied Scott Hall (who was released from the company during the game's development) for his match against Stone Cold Steve Austin (who also did not appear in the game, likely due to creative issues that year). Test was not part of the pay-per-view broadcast but did wrestle on the pre-show.\nVisual and audio.\nThe gameplay takes place in a \"side-to-side\" view of the ring from a single, fixed point of view providing a view of the wrestlers themselves and the audience in the background. The digitized sprite characters were described to look like as their onscreen counterparts and that they also move rather \"smoothly\" as well, thanks to an overall increase in animation.\nFrom an audio standpoint the game featured versions of each wrestler's entrance music and the occasional catch phrase, but no ring commentary during the match. The sound was described as \"high-quality as well, with punches, kicks, and slams having a crisp meaty sound\" that captures the high-impact world of the WWE.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic, based on a total of ten reviews, four of which were positive and six were mixed. Metacritic's user score was slightly better, listed as \"generally favorable\" with a score of 7.5. GameZone said that the game does a solid job of emulating WWE wrestling while challenging and entertaining the players and rated it as \"great\"."

These can be wrapped around sections of rock, hitched to other pieces of equipment, or tied directly to a tensioned line using a Prusik style knot. They may be used as anchors, to extend an anchor to reduce rope drag, in anchor equalization, or to climb a rope.\nUses.\nIn 1957 Jan and Herb Conn wrote an article titled \"the versatile runner\" with long list of uses, which is still quite accurate:\nOther possible uses include:\nTypes.\nSlings come both sewn to length and assembled from loose webbing knotted as desired. Common sewn lengths include , , , and . They are available in widths of . Webbing for slings, also known as \"tape\", is sold off the reel, cut to length with a hot knife to prevent fraying, and tied. The most common knot used for nylon slings are water knots and double fisherman's knots. Dyneema/Spectra slings are usually sewn not tied due to very high lubricity which leads to poor knot-holding ability and has led to the recommendation to use the triple fisherman's knot rather than the traditional double fisherman\nSewn slings have a rated breaking strength of at least . Short sewn slings are a component of quickdraws, sometimes known as \"dogbones\". Traditionally, slings have been made of nylon. Increasingly, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene sold under the brand names Dyneema, Dynex and Spectra is used. These have much lower melting points than nylon, making them a potentially poor choice where high rope friction may occur. However this specialty polyethylene is lighter, smaller, and absorbs less water than nylon, and therefore has become popular.\nGear sling.\nA gear sling is a loop of webbing used to organize or carry equipment. These can be custom items meant only to carry light gear, fully load-bearing manufactured gear racks capable of doubling for a sling, or simply a regular sling used to rack gear."

        "text": "The 2007 Campeonato Sudamericano Copa América, known simply as the 2007 Copa América or 2007 Copa América Venezuela, was the 42nd edition of the Copa América, the South-American championship for international association football teams. The competition was organized by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body, and was held between 26 June and 15 July in Venezuela, which hosted the tournament for the first time.\nThe competition was won by Brazil (they were also the defending champions), who beat Argentina 3–0 in the final.\nMexico took third place by beating Uruguay 3–1 in the third-place match. Brazil thus won the right to represent CONMEBOL at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nCompeting nations.\nAs with previous tournaments, all ten members of CONMEBOL participated in the competition. In order to bring the number of competing teams to twelve, CONMEBOL invited Mexico and the United States, the two highest ranking CONCACAF teams in the FIFA World Rankings. Just as in every tournament since 1993, Mexico accepted the invitation. The United States rejected the invitation due to scheduling conflicts with the 2007 Major League Soccer season. CONMEBOL then proceeded to invite Costa Rica, the third highest CONCACAF team in FIFA's ranking. In the end, the United States accepted the invitation.\nVenues.\nFor this Copa América, the organizing committee decided to choose eight cities to hold the tournament. A total of 14 cities presented proposal before the committee, of which they rejected proposals from Barquisimeto, Maracay, Valencia, Valera, Portuguesa and Miranda for not meeting established requirements. The cities of Barinas, Caracas, Ciudad Guayana, Maracaibo, Maturín, Mérida, Puerto la Cruz and San Cristóbal were selected to host the tournament. Later on, the organizing committee reconsidered the candidacy of Barquisimeto, based on the proposal of a new stadium to be built for the city. With a final nine host cities, the 2007 edition broke the previous records for host cities set by the 2004 Copa América in Peru, which used seven.\nOfficials.\nOn 30 May 2007, CONMEBOL announced the list of match officials for the competition. The list included one match official from every country (except Paraguay, which had two). From these thirteen, six officiated in the 2006 FIFA World Cup: Carlos Simon, Óscar Ruiz, Carlos Amarilla, Jorge Larrionda, and Armando Archundia.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the competition took place on 14 February 2007 in the Teresa Carreño Theater in Caracas.\nSquads.\nEach association had to present a list of twenty-three players to compete in the competition.\nGroup stage.\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the twelve teams divided into three groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first, second and two best-placed third teams in each group qualified for the Quarter-finals.\nTeams were ranked on the following criteria:\n\"All times are in Venezuela Standard Time ().\"\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nAt the end of the first stage, a comparison was made between the third-placed teams of each group. The two best third-placed teams advanced to the quarter-finals.\nGoalscorers.\nWith six goals, Robinho was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 86 goals were scored by 53 different players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\nMarketing.\nSponsorship.\nGlobal Platinum Sponsor\nGlobal Gold Sponsor\nGlobal Silver Sponsor\nCharitable Partner\nLocal Supplier\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball for the tournament was the Nike \"Mercurial Veloci\". The ball was presented on 14 February 2007, prior to a friendly match played between Venezuela and New Zealand, by the president of the Venezuelan Football Federation, Rafael Esquivel, to the mayor of Maracaibo, Giancarlo Di Martino – head of the local organising committee.\nMascot.\nGuaky is a scarlet macaw, a bird representative of Venezuela. He wore the traditional jersey Venezuela national football team burgundy and football shoes. Under their wings the characteristic tricolor national flag, with its eight stars on their wings.\nTo choose the official mascot held a contest in which proposals received 4,500,000 of Venezuelan children and adolescents at a school. The winning draw corresponded to the 15-year-old Jhoyling Zabaleta. The final design was commissioned to Fractal Studio, bring life and a \"strong personality, cheerful and sport\" that accompanied the event during its realization. The name of the pet, Guaky was subsequently elected by an online survey, where that option was a 54.17% of preferences."

        "title": "Brian Baker (tennis)",
        "text": "Brian Richard Baker (born April 30, 1985) is an American retired professional tennis player from Nashville, Tennessee.\nJunior career.\nAs a junior player, Baker won the 2002 Orange Bowl. In 2003, he reached the boys' singles final of the French Open after beating Marcos Baghdatis in the quarterfinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. In the final, he lost to Stan Wawrinka.\nBaker reached No. 2 in singles and No. 5 in doubles in the junior world rankings.\nPro career.\nEarly career.\nBaker's biggest win of his fledgling career occurred in August 2005, when he scored an upset victory over ninth-seeded Gastón Gaudio in the 2005 US Open. The victory was Baker's first Grand Slam win. Baker originally played on the tour for only a short time, from 2002 through 2005, as well as participating in three autumn Challenger events in 2007. He won one Challenger event in singles (and three in doubles) during this time and reached a career-best singles ranking of world No. 172 on November 15, 2004. He was coached by Ricardo Acuña.\nIn 2007, he was sidelined for nearly six years after five surgeries—three on his hip, one on his elbow, and one sports hernia—and did not play on the tour again until 2011.\nReturn to professional tennis.\nWhile coaching tennis at Belmont University, Baker began to feel his body gradually improving and decided to try again to make it as a professional tennis player in the summer of 2011. He subsequently entered an ITF Futures tournament in Pittsburgh in July 2011 as an unranked qualifier, qualified, and won the tournament, all without dropping a set. In September, he entered the Canadian Futures 7 and reached the semifinals, again without dropping a set. He lost in a walkover to Jesse Levine. Two months later, in November 2011, Baker entered the 2011 Knoxville Challenger, and qualified for the tournament after straight-set victories over Jordan Cox, Tim Smyczek and Michael McClune. He went on to win his next four matches, before losing to Jesse Levine in the final.\n2012.\nBaker won three Futures and Challenger tournaments early in 2012 before returning to the ATP Tour: USA F3 and F8, and Sarasota.\nAfter winning the Savannah Challenger, beating Augustin Gensse in the final in April 2012, he was awarded a wild card for the 2012 French Open. In response to this, Baker's good friend Amer Delić noted an inconvenient truth about the situation by tweeting, \"Brian Baker... Same guy that USTA refused to give a WC for qualies of the clay court Future last summer...\" The statement was in reference to the USA F17 tournament that Baker went on to win.\nShortly before the French Open, he qualified for the 2012 Open de Nice Côte d'Azur in May, beating Ilija Bozoljac, David Guez, and Alejandro González in the qualification rounds, all in straight sets. Baker then faced Sergey Stakhovsky in the first round, losing the first set before recovering to win the match. A straight sets victory against Gaël Monfils meant that Baker progressed to the quarterfinals of the tournament. Hard-fought wins over Mikhail Kukushkin and Nikolay Davydenko took Baker to his first ATP final on a 15-match winning streak going into the match. He ultimately lost to Nicolás Almagro, the repeat champion, in the final. After his surprising performance, he reached his highest singles ranking at No. 141.\nJust two days after the final in Nice, Baker headed to Paris for the French Open. He beat Xavier Malisse in straight sets in the first round, before losing to Gilles Simon in the second round in five sets. Despite the defeat, Baker's appearance in the tournament was described as \"one of the most remarkable comebacks of modern times.\"\nTwo weeks after the French Open, Baker qualified for the 2012 Wimbledon Championships after beating Radu Albot, Denis Gremelmayr, and Maxime Teixeira in the qualification rounds. He secured a straight-set victory over Rui Machado in his first-round match before dismissing Jarkko Nieminen, also in straight sets, to progress to the third round. In his third-round match, he beat Frenchman Benoît Paire in four sets. Baker bowed out of the competition in the fourth round, losing in straight sets to Philipp Kohlschreiber. On his performance at Wimbledon, Baker stated - \"It's been an unbelievable run. I don't know if I put an expectation like I need to get to this round or not. But I don't know if starting first round qualifiers I would have thought I would have got to the fourth round of Wimbledon\".\nAfter starting the North American hard-court season with a string of four first-round losses to lower-ranked players, Baker pulled off another remarkable upset, gaining revenge by beating world No. 17 (and recent Wimbledon quarterfinalist) Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters. He subsequently lost to Australian Bernard Tomic in the second round. At the 2012 US Open, he matched his best US Open and Grand Slam performance from before his injuries, reaching the second round. He defeated Jan Hájek before falling to eighth seed Janko Tipsarević.\nDuring the indoor hard-court season, Baker qualified (as the top qualifying seed) for the ATP 500 tournament Beijing, losing in the first round to Kevin Anderson. He then qualified for the Shanghai Masters, losing to 11th seed Richard Gasquet in the opening round. After these consecutive first-round losses, Baker pulled off a remarkable comeback by winning against Radek Štěpánek in Basel, after being a set and a double-break down. Baker lost in the second round to eventual champion Juan Martín del Potro.\nHe ended 2012 ranked world No. 61, after reaching a career-high ranking of world No. 52 in October.\n2013.\nIn the Heineken Open in Auckland, Baker upset fifth seed (and recent Paris Masters finalist) Jerzy Janowicz in the first round. He converted 2 out of 17 break points and finally won on his eighth match point.\nIn the second round of the Australian Open, Baker led 20th seed Sam Querrey 7–6(2), 1–1 before a knee injury forced him to retire. This was later diagnosed as a torn meniscus, which put Baker off the tour for about four months.\nBaker made his return in Aptos. losing to Guido Pella. He then lost to Grigor Dimitrov in the second round of the Cincinnati Masters. At the U.S Open. he was defeated by Lleyton Hewitt in the first round.\nHe ended 2013 ranked world No. 359.\n2014.\nBaker withdrew from the 2014 Australian Open, citing a knee injury.\n2015–2017.\nHe was granted a wild card into the main draw of the 2016 Australian Open after a nearly three-year injury layoff.\nIn August 2016, he lost in the Round of 16 of the Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles partnering with Rajeev Ram. They faced off against the Austrian team of Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya. \nIn February 2017, he won his maiden ATP Tour title at the Memphis Open in doubles partnering Nikola Mektić. They faced off against compatriots Ryan Harrison and Steve Johnson in the final. He won his second doubles title in Budapest in April, again partnering with Mektić.\n2018.\nBaker underwent his 14th major surgery on December 21, 2018 (back), delaying his comeback.\nPersonal life.\nBaker was as an assistant coach for the Belmont University men's tennis program for four years. He studied toward business and finance degrees at the university."

        "title": "Cricket in fiction",
        "text": "The sport of cricket has long held a special place in Anglophone culture, and a specialised niche in English literature. Cricket is the official summer sport in England, and it is widely known as the \"gentleman's game\", owing to the unique culture of the sport and its emphasis on ideals such as grace, sportsmanship, character and complexity. Cricket has therefore often attracted the attention (and in some cases, fandom) of the literati – Lamb, Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt were all players of the game – and some of the greatest English writers have written about cricket. This was particularly true in the era before the Second World War, for example, during the Edwardian era, and in the 1920s and 1930s.\nVictorian literature.\nAn early chapter of Dickens's famous first novel \"The Pickwick Papers\", serialised as early as 1836, features a brief description of a cricket match between the All-Muggleton team and the Dingley Dell Cricket Club. Mr Pickwick watches as Mr Jingle provides a running commentary on the game (\"Capital game—smart sport—fine exercise—very\" is a typical Jingle comment.)\nCricket also plays a prominent part in \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" (1857), Thomas Hughes' classic novel of life at Rugby. A century after Hughes's book, the school's bully Flashman (and his cricket career) were resurrected by the novelist George MacDonald Fraser (see below). Anthony Trollope also wrote occasionally about cricket.\nE. W. Hornung wrote a series of short stories about the adventures of the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, who was a fine cricketer. In The Field Bazaar, a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss Watson's history as a cricketer and his plans to help the University of Edinburgh raise money for a new cricket pavilion.\nCricket in pre-WWII literature.\nThere have been several famous cricket matches in post-Victorian literature, notably the village cricket match which forms the centrepiece of A. G. Macdonell's minor classic \"England, Their England\" (1933).\nAnother well-known example comes from the work of Siegfried Sassoon. In 1928, Sassoon, by then a famed war poet, published \"Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man\", the first volume of his George Sherston trilogy. The book, ostensibly a novel, is in effect a lyrical love-letter from the author to his vanished Edwardian childhood, set in the dreamy English countryside. The Butley flower show match is a classic evocation of cricket on the village green.\nCricket played a role in the Lord Peter Wimsey novels of Dorothy Sayers. There are numerous references to Wimsey's achievements as a cricket blue at Oxford, and an extensive description of a game of cricket is a crucial element in solving the murder in \"Murder Must Advertise\" (1933).\nAnother writer from this period is Hugh de Sélincourt. He wrote two novels with cricket as their subject – \"The Cricket Match\" (1924) is better known than its successor \"The Game of the Season\" (1935). Oxford University Press reprinted both these books in the early 1980s.\nThe novel \"Son of Grief\" by Dudley Carew (1936) was rated highly by John Arlott. He wrote: \"It has its darknesses, but it is convincing, and its characters are rounded and credible.\"\nThe great humorist P. G. Wodehouse was an avid fan of the game and a dedicated player as well – winning admiration for his medium paced bowling. Cricket is central to the plot of his novel \"Mike\" (1909) and its sequels including \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), which feature talented cricketer Michael \"Mike\" Jackson and his friend Psmith, also revealed to be a talented player. Wodehouse's cricketing companions included J. M. Barrie, Hugh de Selincourt and Arthur Conan Doyle, playing for either the \"Punch XI\" or the Allahakbarries, whose name, said Barrie, derived from the Arabic invocation meaning \"Heaven help us\". (This is technically incorrect as the meaning of the Arabic phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" is \"God is great.\") Cricket popped up frequently in his novels and short stories, and the anthology \"Wodehouse at the Wicket\", edited by Murray Hedgcock, is an attempt to capture the Master's writings about his favourite sport.\nJ. M. Barrie and A. A. Milne – creators of \"Peter Pan\" and \"Winnie the Pooh\" respectively – also wrote about cricket.\nPost-war fiction.\nBruce Hamilton wrote the novel \"Pro: An English tragedy\" in 1946. Also in 1946 came \"The Devil in Woodford Wells\", a novel by Harold Hobson (1946).\nWilliam Godfrey (a pseudonym of Sam Youd) wrote the first two novels of what had been intended to be a trilogy: \"The Friendly Game\" (1956) and \"Malleson at Melbourne\" (1957).\nIn the 1960s, Leslie Frewin edited a couple of anthologies of literary cricket (including both short stories and extracts from novels) under the title \"The Best of Cricket's Fiction\".\n\"A Season in Sinji\" (1967) by J.L. Carr is a novel mainly set at a fictional RAF base in West Africa during the Second World War; it features a bizarre cricket match.\nMore recently, George MacDonald Fraser claimed in his novel \"Flashman's Lady\" (1977) that Harry Flashman was the first cricketer to record a \"hat-trick\". The caddish fictional hero participates in a cricket match at Lord's in 1842 that features some of the leading cricketers of that era – Felix, Fuller Pilch, and Alfred Mynn. (Flashman gets Felix's wicket through skill, Pilch's through luck, and Mynn's by 'knavery'.) MacDonald Fraser takes great care to describe the sights and sounds of Lord's as it was in the 1840s. Although very different from Sassoon's style, his descriptions of the cricket match and its setting often reach an idyllic beauty that fits in well with the romantic nostalgia for village cricket during much of the 20th century.\nIn \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" (1982), the third book in Douglas Adams's \"Hitchhiker series\", Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect travel through the space-time continuum to Lord's, where a shocking act of cricket vandalism takes place – the Ashes trophy is stolen by a band of robber-robots from the planet Krikkit. The novel contains an alternative explanation of the genesis of the game – cricket is actually the product of a sort of \"interspecies collective unconscious memory\", and it is the humans who have shamelessly trivialised it into a sport.\nAbout 50 years after the bodyline controversy, Paul Wheeler wrote a fictionalised account of that infamous series in \"Bodyline: The Novel\" (1983). Wheeler also wrote the script for the Australian mini-series \"Bodyline\" (1984).\nWillie Rushton wrote the comic novel \"W.G. Grace's Last Case\" (1984), in which he imagined the cricketer having a side-line as a private detective.\nAlso in the 1980s, the writer and broadcaster Peter Tinniswood published a series of ten books on cricket, fictional and humorous in nature.\nEarly professional cricket in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars forms part of the historical backdrop to Bernard Cornwell's novel, \"Gallows Thief\" (2002).\nCricket is a major part of the novella \"24 for 3\" (2007) by Jennie Walker, set in London, and the novel \"Netherland\" (2008) by Joseph O'Neill, set in New York.\n\"Chinaman: The Legend of Pradeep Mathew\" by Shehan Karunatilaka (2008) (known only by the subtitle in the USA) is in large part, an exploration of Sri Lankan cricket.\nIn 2012 the former Derbyshire opening batsman and screenwriter Peter Gibbs wrote a novel, \"Settling the Score\", about a fictional county match late in the 1969 season.\nNew Zealand cricket fiction.\nNew Zealand has produced some cricket fiction (mainly works for children and young people) and two adult novels in Michael O’Leary's \"Out of It\" (1987) and W. J.

        "text": "José Jiménez (born July 7, 1973) is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). He appeared in seven seasons from 1998 to 2004 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Colorado Rockies, and Cleveland Indians. The Cardinals signed him as an amateur free agent in his native Dominican Republic in 1991. Jiménez' career in MLB commenced as a starting pitcher with the Cardinals and he converted to relief pitching with the Rockies, saving more than 100 games.\nAs a rookie with the Cardinals in 1999, Jiménez pitched a no-hitter in the first of two consecutive starts defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks and future Hall of Famer Randy Johnson in 1−0 complete game shutouts. After converting to relief with the Rockies, he set club records for saves in a single season with 41 in 2002 and career with 102. Results were mixed in his last three seasons, as his earned run average in 2002 was 3.56 and he experienced consecutive season with 2−10 win–loss records and 1−7 in his final MLB season of 2004.\nSt.Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals signed Jiménez as an amateur free agent in 1991.\nMajor League debut (1998).\nThe Cardinals first called Jiménez up to the major league roster in 1998, and he made his major league debut on against the Cincinnati Reds on September 9, 1998. He completed three innings pitched, allowing no earned runs, one hit and one walk with two strikeouts. Jiménez made four major league appearances with three starts in 1998, allowing seven earned runs in innings for a 2.95 earned run average (ERA).\nRookie season and no-hitter (1999).\nStill considered a rookie in 1999, Jiménez became a regular in the Cardinals' starting rotation. He pitched a no-hitter against eventual Hall of Famer Randy Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks on June 25, 1999. The Cardinals were victorious by a score of 1–0. He is one of the 24 rookie pitchers to have pitched a no-hitter in Major League history. For the week ending June 27, he earned National League Player of the Week honors. In Jiménez' second start after the no-hitter, he again faced Johnson and the Diamondbacks, winning a second consecutive complete game shutout decision by a 1−0 score while allowing two hits. The two starts against Johnson and the Diamondbacks were the only two shutouts of Jiménez' major league career. He finished the 1999 season with a 5−14 record and a 5.85 ERA in 29 appearances and 28 starts.\nColorado Rockies.\nJiménez was acquired by the 2000 season and became a staple in the Rockies bullpen, transitioning from starter to closer. From 2000-2003 he collected 102 saves for the Rockies, becoming the all-time saves leader in the Rockies franchise. He set a franchise record 41 saves in 2002, while having an ERA of 3.56 despite having a record of 2–10. The following season he swung back into a starter, making seven starts and 20 saves for the Rockies, but ballooned his ERA to 5.22 and again having a record of 2–10.\nCleveland Indians.\nAt 30 years old, he pitched in 2004 for the Indians; he would wind up released after going 1–7 with an 8.42 ERA.\nPost-Major League career.\nAt the Pan-American Games, Jiménez tested positive for a banned substance and was subsequently removed from the competition."

        "text": "The semi-final of the 1970 FIFA World Cup between Italy and West Germany has been called the \"Game of the Century\" (; ; ). It was played on 17 June 1970 at the \"Estadio Azteca\" in Mexico City. Italy won 4–3 after five of the seven goals were scored in extra time, the record for most goals scored during extra time in a FIFA World Cup game. The result eliminated West Germany from the tournament while Italy went on to lose to Brazil in the final.\nThe match.\nItaly led 1–0 for the majority of the match, after Roberto Boninsegna scored in the 8th minute. In the 70th minute, West German defender Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder, but stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions.\nDefender Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for West Germany in the 90th minute. German television commentator Ernst Huberty famously exclaimed \"Schnellinger, of all people!\" (in German: \"Schnellinger! Ausgerechnet Schnellinger!\"), since Schnellinger played in Italy's professional football league, Serie A, at A.C. Milan (for whom he had never scored). It was also his first and only goal in a career total of 47 matches for the West German national team. At the end of regulation time, the score was level at 1–1, forcing the match into extra time. Had the match remained drawn after extra time, lots would have been drawn to decide which team would progress to the final.\nGerd Müller put West Germany ahead in the 94th minute following a defensive error by Fabrizio Poletti who had just come into the game as a substitute, but Tarcisio Burgnich tied it back up only four minutes later, and then striker Gigi Riva put the Italians in front again with a superb goal. Müller scored yet again, this time with a header, for West Germany to tie the score at 3–3. Yet, as the live television coverage was still replaying Müller's goal, Italian midfielder Gianni Rivera scored what proved to be the game-winning goal in the 111th minute. Being left unmarked near the penalty area, Rivera had connected perfectly with a fine cross made by Boninsegna, clinching the victory for Italy at 4–3."

        "title": "1965 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The 1965 NFL playoffs determined the champion of the National Football League in professional American football for its season. Although a single championship game between conference winners was the current format for the league, a tie in the Western Conference standings between the Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Colts necessitated a rare tiebreaker playoff, the first in the league in seven years and the first in the Western conference since 1957. A coin flip decided the home team.\nThe teams had played twice during the regular season and Green Bay had won both: 20–17 in Milwaukee on September 26, and 42–27 in Baltimore on December 12.\nBoth teams were hampered on offense without their starting quarterbacks. Colts Johnny Unitas and Gary Cuozzo were both sidelined with injuries, and newly signed replacements Ed Brown and George Haffner were ruled ineligible by the league owners, so fifth-year running back Tom Matte, a quarterback in college at Ohio State, was thrust into service behind center. Defensive back Bobby Boyd, a one-time Oklahoma quarterback, assumed the back-up role. Packers QB Bart Starr was injured (ribs) on the first play, so veteran Zeke Bratkowski played the rest of the game, backed up by halfback Paul Hornung and safety Willie Wood. Tied at 10 points at the end of regulation, the game went into overtime for over 13 minutes. At the time, it was the longest game in NFL history. Green Bay kicker Don Chandler made a controversial field goal late in regulation (22 yards) to tie the game at ten. He then booted the winning 25-yarder in overtime.\nAlthough the championship game was played in 1966 on January 2, it is recognized as part of the 1965 NFL season. It was the latest date for an NFL Championship Game to that point, and the first time in league history that the game was held after all of the college bowl games.\nThe Playoff Bowl (a consolation game between the conference runners-up) for the 1965 season took place in Miami on January 9, 1966, the Sunday following the NFL championship game. With Matte at quarterback, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 35–3; the rusty Cowboys' previous game was three weeks earlier, on December 19. This capped a season where the Western Conference won 15 out of 16 interconference games against the Eastern Conference, including the championship game and Playoff Bowl.\nThe tiebreaker playoff between Green Bay and Baltimore was the last for the NFL; the league expanded to sixteen teams in four divisions in and a point differential was introduced to break ties. It was used that year in the Coastal Division, where Baltimore (11–1–2) tied with Los Angeles for the best overall record in the league, but was left out of the postseason, which consisted of the four division winners only; the wild card team was introduced in 1970 with the realignment of the AFL–NFL merger. The American Football League (AFL) had two tiebreaker playoff games, the last in 1968."

        "title": "Cricket nets",
        "text": "Cricket nets are used by batters and bowlers to practice their cricketing techniques. They consist of a cricket pitch (natural or artificial) enclosed by netting on either side, behind, and optionally above. The bowling end is left open.\nNets stop the cricket ball travelling across the field when the batter plays a shot. They save practice time and eliminate the need for fielders or a wicket-keeper. They allow more people to train at once, particularly when they have several lanes. They allow solitary batting practice when used with a bowling machine.\nUse.\nNets are fundamental to cricket practice and are used at every level of the game. Professional cricket clubs are likely to have over 10 lanes of nets, and be able to practice both indoors and outdoors. Nets are also very prevalent in educational establishments, as they allow safe and efficient training with a high volume of pupils when there are significant time constraints. Keen cricketers may have nets in their gardens.\nNets helps safe practice. By containing most aerial cricket balls, they reduce the potential for injury of bystanders. However, the nets need an opening for the bowler, so it is still common for balls to leave the nets, and shouts of heads up are commonly heard.\nTypes.\nIndoor and outdoor cricket nets differ significantly.\nIndoor.\nIndoor nets are often suspended on a track (runner) fixed to the ceiling of the sports hall or gymnasium no. The nets can drop 4–8 metres to the ground, and be over 20 metres long. Indoors nets are commonly multi-lane, with two- or four-lane nets being particularly common.\nIndoor nets tend to be white. They have separate 3-metre-high canvas screens that enclose the area immediately surrounding the batsman, for two reasons. First, the netting near the batsman has by far the highest work rate, and canvas is significantly more durable than mesh netting, so screens improves the nets' lifespan. Second, the batsman is less likely to be distracted.\nIndoor nets can be suspended on runners, providing a curtain system where they can be pulled in and out of use. This allows the sports facility to be flexible in its use.\nOutdoor.\nOutdoor nets are the most common form of practice nets. They take many forms, with some being homemade whilst others are professional manufactured and installed. The design and construction of outdoor nets tends to be based around two factors: the frequency and age of those who will use them, and the available space. In schools and cricket clubs where use will be high, construction will be tailored to that. The nets may also need safeguards against misuse or vandalism. Therefore, the frame is often constructed out of heavy-duty galvanised steel tube with an overall diameter ranging from 34 to 50 mm. The tube is then joined by key-clamp brackets. This system requires permanent concrete ground sockets, but the actual frame of the cage can still be dismantled and removed. Outdoor nets can be fitted with wheels to be completely mobile.\nThere are variations in the design of outdoor nets such as use of pulley system where the netting is mounted on a cable that spans posts located at either end. Garden nets are frequently home-made, often to a professional design with locally sourced components. This saves money, and cricket nets have a simple design and purpose, so are not difficult to make. Nets should be no less than 9 ft wide, with 12 ft being optimum. If the nets are under 24 ft long, they should be at least 9 ft high; if under 36 ft long, at least 10 ft high; and 12 ft high if longer than that. This prevents balls ending up on the roof of the nets when bowled. The length is less critical, but the longer the safer.\nNetting.\nNetting is the most important component. The netting twine is usually made of a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, which is hardwearing and relatively cheap. Before about 1995, nets were often made from nylon, but this became too expensive. Nets are often black, green or white. The mesh gap is usually 50 mm and the twine will commonly have a diameter of 1.8 to 3.0 mm. Netting may be knotless or knotted: knotted is considered superior. The breaking strength of knotted netting is higher for the same diameter twine. Good twine will be UV stabilized and rot proof. For home-made nets, netting is the only specialist supply.\nNetting is seamed at its edges to prevent fraying. The seam is usually a 6 mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce wear. Also, partial canvas skirts of 0.5 m can be added to the bottom to prevent damage from wild animals.\nIn other sports.\nThe baseball equivalent is the batting cage, though fundamentally different, as that provides complete ball containment, whereas cricket nets do not."

        "text": "Samuel E. Mitchell Jr. (born September 2, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. Playing at small forward, Mitchell's 18-year professional basketball career spanned three decades, and was most notable for his ten seasons with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves, whom he also coached as an interim for the 2015–16 season. Mitchell coached for the Toronto Raptors from 2004 to 2008 as well, winning Coach of the Year Award in 2007.\nMitchell has since worked as an analyst for TSN, NBA TV, and works as a talk show co-host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio.\nEarly years.\nMitchell graduated from Columbus High School in 1981. He spent the next four years playing college basketball at Mercer University (1981–85), and scored nearly 2,000 points, becoming the leading scorer in Bears history. He led the team to both the regular-season and postseason Trans American Atlantic Conference championships in 1985. Averaging 25 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as a senior, Mitchell led the Bears to just their second NCAA tournament in team history in 1985; they would not return for nearly 30 years, until the 2014 tournament.\nMitchell had enlisted in the Army during his junior year, and at the conclusion of the 1985 NCAA tournament he went to boot camp at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He left one month later when he was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the 7th pick of the 3rd round (54th overall) in the 1985 NBA draft. However, he was cut during final cuts and joined the Wisconsin Flyers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA).\nUnhappy in the CBA, Mitchell quit the team midway through the season to return home to Georgia, where a former professor hired him a special education teacher for the remainder of the school year. With his summer off, he tried out for the U.S. Basketball League, and joined the Tampa Bay Flash, who he helped lead to the league title. He rejoined the Rockets for training camp afterwards, but was once again cut and joined the CBA, splitting the season between the Wisconsin Flyers and Rapid City Thrillers. He then joined the French LNB Pro A team of Montpellier Basket (coached by Pierre Galle) for the end of the 1987–88 and the whole 1988–89 season.\nSuccess overseas led to a renewed interest from the NBA, and Mitchell earned a contract with the newly formed Minnesota Timberwolves. He spent three years in Minnesota, before being traded to the Indiana Pacers. While having a smaller role with the Pacers than he did with the Timberwolves, Mitchell did help Indiana reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1994–95. Following that season, he returned to Minnesota. Future All-Star Kevin Garnett was drafted by the Timberwolves out of high school that year, and Mitchell has been credited with helping Garnett's development. Mitchell retired from the league following the 2001–02 season.\nCoaching career.\nMitchell returned to the NBA almost immediately after his retirement as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks for two seasons until 2004. He then briefly became a part of the expansion Charlotte Bobcats as their top assistant coach, until moving on to the Toronto Raptors when he was named as the sixth head coach in Raptors history after incumbent Kevin O'Neill was fired.\nMitchell was named the coach of the month in January 2007 for his effort bringing the Toronto Raptors back to .500 and leading the Atlantic Division. On March 30, 2007, Mitchell got his 100th win as NBA coach when the Raptors defeated the Washington Wizards at the Verizon Center.\nMitchell, who witnessed his team struggle with rebuilding in his first years as coach, also led the Toronto Raptors to their first division title in franchise history as the team won the Atlantic Division in the NBA's Eastern Conference in the 2006–07 season. On April 24, 2007, he was named 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year. On May 22, 2007 after leading the Raptors to their first playoffs appearance since 2002, and after much speculation, Mitchell was signed to a four-year contract with the Raptors.\nOn November 25, 2007 Mitchell surpassed Lenny Wilkens for the most wins in team history. Mitchell was the longest reigning head coach of the Toronto Raptors.\nOn December 3, 2008, after leading the Raptors to a disappointing 8–9 start to the 2008–09 season, Mitchell was relieved of his duties as the team's head coach. Assistant coach Jay Triano took over the position of interim head coach of the Raptors, which later made him the first foreign-born player to coach a team in the NBA. The firing was ridiculed by the TNT Overtime crew because the Raptors were only one game under .500 at the time of the firing. Chris Webber predicted that they would not be \"as good under another coach.\" In fact, the Raptors went 25–40 the rest of the season.\nMitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the New Jersey Nets on July 19, 2010. On December 6, 2011, Nets hired P.J. Carlesimo and Mario Elie as new assistant coaches and Mitchell was reassigned to a scouting position.\nOn 2012, Sam Mitchell named head coach of USA select to 2012 William Jones Cup in Taiwan and his team finished bronze medal.\nOn June 16, 2014, Mitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nOn September 11, 2015, Mitchell became the Timberwolves' interim head coach after Flip Saunders had to take a leave of absence to receive treatment after being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. For the rest of the season, Mitchell became the official head coach, although he would still be treated as an interim coach. During his sole season coaching the Timberwolves, he would coach them to the fifth-worst record in the league with a 29–53 record.\nOn April 13, 2016, Mitchell was relieved of his interim head coaching duties as the coach of the Timberwolves after the last game of the season, allowing them to look for a permanent coach. He would then be replaced by former Chicago Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau.\nOn June 13, 2018, Mitchell was hired by the University of Memphis as assistant coach under Penny Hardaway.\nAfter one year as one of Memphis's assistant coaches, Sam Mitchell is no longer with the program.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell lives in Atlanta, Georgia with his wife, Dawn Session-Mitchell. Mitchell has four children from a previous marriage."

        "title": "1744 English cricket season",
        "text": "The 1744 cricket season in England is remembered for the earliest known codification of the \"Laws of Cricket\". This was drafted by members of several cricket clubs, though the code was not published until 1755. Much of its terminology such as no ball, over, toss, umpire and wicket remain in current use. The season is also notable for the two earliest known surviving match scorecards. The second of those matches, played on Monday, 18 June, was a celebrated event in which a Kent county team challenged an England team at the Artillery Ground, Kent winning by one wicket.\nIn September, Slindon Cricket Club defeated London Cricket Club and then issued a challenge to play \"any parish in England\". The challenge was accepted by the Addington and Bromley clubs, but there is no record of either challenge match having been completed. The single wicket form of the sport was popular and reports have survived of four top-class matches played at the Artillery Ground. Several eleven-a-side matches are the subject of surviving pre-match announcements or post-match summaries. Some reports mention crowd disturbances and efforts were made to implement control by means of admission charges and limitations on the sale of alcohol. Wagering on cricket was common and some matches are known to have been played for high stakes.\nThe \"Laws of Cricket\".\nThe earliest known coded issue of the \"Laws of Cricket\" was drafted by members of several clubs including London, of which Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, was president. Representatives of the clubs met at the \"Star and Garter\" tavern on Pall Mall, London. The heading of the printed version, published in 1755, reads: \"The Game at Cricket, As settled by the Several Cricket-Clubs, Particularly that of the Star and Garter in Pall-Mall\". According to \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 1965, these Laws were undoubtedly a recension of a much earlier code. No earlier code has been found. However, there were cases of Articles of Agreement being drawn up, as for the matches in 1727 between Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton.\nSome of the main points in the 1744 code:\nThere are four Laws for bowlers but they do not say he must roll the ball and there is no mention of prescribed arm action, only that he must \"deliver the ball\" with one foot behind the bowling crease. Rowland Bowen, writing in the 1965 edition of \"Wisden\", asserts that the ball was bowled in the true sense (all along the ground) through the first half of the 18th century and that this was the rule prior to the 1750s, though it was largely forsaken by the 1770s after bowlers began pitching the ball.\nEarliest known scorecards.\nThe season is also notable for the two earliest known surviving match scorecards. It is not until the 1772 season that more scorecards of top-class matches have survived, although a handful of cards from minor matches have been found.\nLondon v Surrey and Sussex, Artillery Ground, 2 June.\nThe first, containing individual scores but no details of dismissals, is from a match between the London Cricket Club and a combined Surrey and Sussex team at the Artillery Ground on 2 June. No titles were given to the teams at the time and various titles, including London v Slindon, have been applied retrospectively by modern authors. London, whose team included given men, was the host club and their opponents were all from the counties of Surrey and Sussex. The scorecard was kept by the 2nd Duke of Richmond at Goodwood House.\nThe card gives the scores by each player and their surnames only, although it does differentiate between the two pairs of brothers (the Harrises and Newlands) who were playing. The \"Daily Advertiser\" carried the names of players expected to play in the match on 1–2 June and reported the same names on 3 June although some of them do not appear on the scorecard. Surrey and Sussex scored 102 runs in the first of their two innings, and 102 for 6 wickets in their second. London scored 79 in their first innings and 70 in their second so that Surrey and Sussex won by 55 runs. The highest individual score in the match was 47 by John Harris of Surrey and Sussex in the second innings. This was the first game at which tickets for readmission are known to have been issued to the spectators.\nEngland v Kent, Artillery Ground, 18 June.\nJust over a fortnight later, on 18 June, the scorecard has also survived from a match at the Artillery Ground between an England team and the Kent county team. The match was arranged by Lord John Sackville who captained the Kent team. England, batting first, totalled 40 and 70 in their two innings; Kent responded with 53 and 58 for 9 to win by one wicket. Richard Newland of England made the two highest individual scores in the match with 18 not out and 15. Details of the dismissals are only partially complete; it is known that Kent bowler William Hodsoll took at least eight wickets. It is the first match for which a scorecard has survived that includes some dismissals. It became the first entry in Arthur Haygarth's \"Scores &amp; Biographies\", although he gave the year as 1746 instead of 1744.\nThe match was described by the \"London Daily Advertiser\" as the \"greatest cricket match ever known\". It was a noted social occasion as the spectators included the Prince of Wales and his brother, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. Also present were the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Admiral Vernon. The poet James Love (1722–1774) commemorated it in his \"Cricket: An Heroic Poem\" (1745), written in rhyming couplets. According to cricket historian H. S. Altham, it \"should be in every cricket lover's library\" and \"his description of the game goes with a rare swing\". The poem is one of the first substantial pieces of literature about cricket – in \"More Than A Game\", former prime minister John Major says it is the earliest-known cricket poem. Love was himself a cricketer and a member of Richmond Cricket Club in Surrey.\nThere was crowd disorder at the match. The \"Daily Advertiser\" reported on Saturday, 30 June that it was \"with difficulty the match was played out\". A decision was taken to charge sixpence admission at future matches on the Artillery Ground. Also, the field would be surrounded by a ring of benches to hold over 800 people and no one without prior authorisation would be allowed within the ring.\nSlindon challenge matches.\nOn Monday, 10 September, the London club hosted a match against Slindon Cricket Club at the Artillery Ground. Play continued into the Tuesday and, after winning the match by an unknown margin, Slindon issued a challenge to play \"any parish in England\" and received immediate acceptances from the Addington and Bromley clubs. These matches were arranged to take place at the Artillery Ground over the next few days and it is known that Slindon v Addington began on Wednesday, 12 September. It was impacted by bad weather and Slindon led by two runs at close of play. There are no surviving reports of play on the 13th. Slindon's match against Bromley was scheduled for Friday, 14 September, but there are no surviving reports of it taking place.\nSingle wicket matches.\nReports have survived of four top-class matches played at the Artillery Ground under single wicket rules. This form of cricket was popular through the 1740s. On Wednesday, 13 June, there was a one-a-side match between two unnamed players \"for a considerable sum of money, in order to determine finally who is the best player\". On Monday, 20 August, there was another one-a-side match \"for a large sum\" between a Sevenoaks player and a London player.\nOn Monday, 17 September, a three-a-side match was billed as \"Long Robin's Side v R. Newland's Side\". The participants were described as the six best players in England. The teams were Robert Colchin (\"Long Robin\"), Val Romney and John Bryant against Richard Newland, Edward Aburrow senior and Joseph Harris. Aburrow replaced John Mills, called the \"famous Kent bowler\", who was originally chosen. The stake was two hundred guineas. There was another \"threes\" match on Monday, 1 October, again \"for a considerable sum\" – Robert Colchin, James Bryant and Joseph Harris played against John Bryant, Val Romney and Thomas Waymark.\nOther eleven-a-side matches.\nReports have survived of three earlier matches between teams called England and Kent. Two of these took place in May at unknown venues and both were won by Kent. They later became the subject of a 1748 court case over unpaid gambling debts. The famous match on 18 June was the return to one on Friday, 15 June at Coxheath Common. Details of this match, including the result, are unknown. The Kent team challenged \"eleven pick'd from any part of England\".\nAlso in May, an England team was twice matched against Surrey. The first was played at Moulsey Hurst on Monday, 14 May, and Surrey won by four runs. The return on the 21st was played at the Artillery Ground but no details, including the result, have been found. A newspaper announcement before the second match warned spectators against encroaching onto the field of play and bringing dogs into the ground.\nDuring the season, there were three matches which modern sources have labelled Two Elevens as each involved unnamed teams. The first of these matches took place at the Artillery Ground on Thursday, 5 July. It is known that spectators had to pay sixpence – the earliest recorded admission charge. The second match began at Moulsey Hurst on Friday, 6 July, and was unfinished. Overnight, one team led by 31 runs with two second innings wickets standing. Play continued at the Artillery Ground on the 7th with admission reduced to the \"usual\" twopence. Near the end of the season on Wednesday, 19 September, the Artillery Ground staged \"a great match between 22 of the best players from Kent, Surrey, Sussex and London\".\nThe prominent Addington and Bromley clubs, who accepted the Slindon challenge in September, were scheduled to play a match against each other on Friday, 13 July. No post-match reports have survived. The venue was Bromley Common where, as stated in a pre-match announcement, no person was allowed to sell liquor \"but who belong to the Parish\". On the previous Monday, a combined Addington and Bromley team were due to play a team called Surrey and the Rest of Kent at Duppas Hill in Croydon. A similar pre-match announcement warned that no person would be allowed to bring liquor into the ground \"that don't live in the Parish\". In other surviving announcements, London were to host matches at the Artillery Ground against Addington on Monday, 30 July; and against Bromley on Monday, 3 September. No post-match reports have been found.\nReports or announcements have been found of five other eleven-a-side matches which all involved London. On Monday, 9 July, they were due to play Richmond on Kennington Common but no match details have survived. London arranged a match against Woburn Cricket Club at the Artillery Ground for Thursday, 19 July, but it had to be postponed for two days because the Honourable Artillery Company required the ground. No post-match report has been found.\nThe other three London matches were against Surrey. They first met at Moulsey Hurst on Friday, 24 August, and London won. Robert Colchin of Bromley and Val Romney of Sevenoaks played as given men for London. The stakes for this match were reported to be \"£50 a side\". There was a return match the following Monday, 27th, at the Artillery Ground and London with Colchin and Romney were again the winners. A third match was scheduled at the Artillery Ground for Friday, 7 September with Romney playing for London but no post-match details are known."

        "text": "Rafael Miguel Noble Magee (March 15, 1919 – May 8, 1998) was a Cuban catcher in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) who played professionally in the United States and his native country between 1945 and 1961. Born in Central Hatillo, in what is now Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba Province, he batted and threw right handed and was listed as tall and .\nAfter spending all or part of four seasons with the New York Cubans of the Negro National League and two years at the Triple-A level of minor league baseball, Noble was 32 years old when he broke into the big leagues on April 18, 1951 with the New York Giants. The rookie was the Giants' second-string catcher that season, starting 26 games behind the plate (workhorse Wes Westrum started 119). He batted .234 with 33 hits, five home runs and 26 runs batted in; all were career highs. During that pennant-winning season, Noble was in the Giants' lineup as their catcher during the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series, when Bobby Thomson hit his famous home run. Noble handled no chances defensively in his one inning of work, and did not get a chance to bat. In the 1951 World Series that followed, he appeared in two games as a pinch hitter and defensive replacement and was hitless in two at bats. In the field, he caught three total innings in relief of Westrum and earned an assist when he threw out Gil McDougald of the New York Yankees for a caught stealing in the eighth inning of Game 6.\nNoble played for the Giants through the 1953 season, though he spent most of 1952 in the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League. Altogether, in 107 MLB games, Noble collected 53 hits, including nine career homers, and batted .218. His career continued at the top levels of minor league baseball through 1961.\nNoble died at the age of 79 in Brooklyn, New York.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project, or Liga Cubana de Béisbol Profesional (Spanish), or The Deadball Era"

        "title": "Colin Patterson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Colin Alexander Patterson (born May 11, 1960) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). An undrafted player, he signed as a free agent with the Calgary Flames in 1983 after three seasons of college hockey with the Clarkson Golden Knights. A defensive specialist, Patterson played eight years with the Flames and was a member of their 1989 Stanley Cup championship team. After missing virtually the entire 1990–91 NHL season due to a knee injury, Patterson returned to the NHL for two seasons as a member of the Buffalo Sabres. He retired in 1994 after playing one season in Slovenia for HK Olimpija Ljubljana.\nPlaying career.\nMinor and college.\nPatterson, a native of Rexdale, Toronto, played minor hockey with the Metro Toronto Hockey League before joining the Royal York Royals of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League for two seasons. In his second season with the Royals, 1979–80, Patterson recorded 30 goals and 90 points in 41 games. A multi-sport athlete in his youth, Patterson also played lacrosse. He was a member of Canada's bronze medal-winning squad at the 1982 World Lacrosse Championship.\nSeveral American universities expressed interest in Patterson during his junior seasons; he chose to study at Clarkson University and play hockey for the Golden Knights. He played three seasons for Clarkson where he scored 155 points in 99 games. He was named to both the East Coast Athletic Conference second all-star and National Collegiate Athletic Association East first All-American teams in 1982–83. While he was never selected in the NHL Entry Draft, Patterson was discovered by the Calgary Flames after they had sent a scout to Clarkson observe his teammate Jim Laing. The Flames were impressed with Patterson's play and attempted to sign him to a contract. He was reluctant to leave Clarkson before completing his degree, but was convinced to sign with Calgary following his junior season when the Flames agreed to pay for him to continue his studies during hockey off-seasons.\nNational Hockey League.\nCalgary assigned Patterson to their Central Hockey League (CHL) affiliate, the Colorado Flames to end the 1982–83 season. He appeared in seven regular season games and three more in the CHL playoffs. The Flames felt that Patterson would benefit from playing with the Canadian national team and at the 1984 Winter Olympics, however Team Canada officials felt he didn't fit the team they were building. The Flames assigned him back to Colorado, intending that he would play the entire 1983–84 season in the CHL. He was recalled to Calgary on October 22, 1983, after only six games for what was expected to be a short stint with the NHL team. Instead, he established a place with Doug Risebrough and Richard Kromm as Calgary's top defensive line and never returned to the minors.\nPatterson scored his first NHL goal on October 26, 1983, against goaltender Mike Liut of the St. Louis Blues. He finished with 26 points in 56 NHL games in his rookie season, then scored what were ultimately career highs with 22 goals and 43 points in 57 games in 1984–85. Patterson had 21 goals in the first 40 games of the season before missing 23 games in the second half due to knee and shoulder injuries. While he was regarded as a top defensive forward for the Flames, he was frequently forced out of the Flames' lineup due to injury during his career. Patterson missed time in 1986–87 due to concussions, and played in only 39 of Calgary's 80 games in 1987–88.\nPatterson's skills as a defensive forward were recognized in the 1988–89 season when he was named a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy. He played in a career-high 74 games, recorded 38 points and his plus-minus of +44 was the third highest in the NHL. Playing on a line with star scorers Doug Gilmour and Joe Mullen, Patterson was regarded as the team's \"unsung hero\" and played a grinding role to generate opportunities for his teammates. In the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Patterson appeared in 22 games and recorded a career high 13 points as the Flames defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the final to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.\nInjury problems returned in 1989–90 as, after recording only eight points in 61 games, Patterson's season was ended when he broke his ankle on March 24, 1990. His attempted return for the 1990–91 season was halted when he suffered torn knee ligaments during a pre-season game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The injury caused him to miss the entire regular season, and he returned to appear in only one playoff game. Unsure how Patterson would return after missing the season, the Flames opted to trade him to the Buffalo Sabres prior to the 1991–92 season. Buffalo acquired him in the hopes that his character and success with Calgary would help the Sabres. Patterson played two seasons in Buffalo and recorded 18 points in 88 games. He then opted to play in Europe for his final professional season in 1993–94. With HK Olimpija Ljubljana of the Slovenian Ice Hockey League, Patterson recorded 32 goals and 83 points in just 14 games.\nPatterson finished his playing career with 96 goals and 205 points in 504 games. He has been honoured multiple times by Clarkson University, for whom he served as team captain in his junior season: His uniform number 25 was retired by the school, and he was inducted into Clarkson's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005. Patterson was also inducted into the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPersonal life.\nPatterson completed his degree in Marketing and management from Clarkson, finishing his final year of studies over three hockey off-seasons. He settled in Calgary with his wife Sherrie and three children. He entered the business world following his playing career and has held executive positions at several companies, including the Montreal Trust Company and then as a vice president with Shaw Cablesystems. He has also served as the president of a fire suppression company, and most recently a general manager with an energy services company. Patterson is also active within the Calgary Flames Alumni Association and often participates in the association's charity events."

        "title": "History of cricket in South Africa from 1918–19 to 1945",
        "text": "This article describes the history of South African cricket from the aftermath of the First World War in 1919 to the end of the Second World War in 1945.\nDomestic cricket from 1919 to 1945.\nDomestic first-class matches focused on the Currie Cup competition which, although it was the national championship, was not always contested because of travel constraints and other reasons. The Currie Cup was not held in seasons when there was a Test tour of South Africa, though it was held in 1931–32 when the South African Test side traveled to Australia and New Zealand.\nUntil 1926 all cricket in South Africa was played on matting pitches. The first Currie Cup match to be played on a turf pitch was held at the Kingsmead ground in Durban in December 1926, between Natal and Border. The first Test matches on turf pitches were held during the English tour of 1930–31. By the end of the 1930s, all first-class matches in South Africa were played on turf pitches.\nSecond World War.\nFrom the outset of the war, South Africa was actively involved as a member of the Allies. The war brought austerity and cricket was considered by many to be frivolous in such circumstances. Only one first-class game was played in South Africa during the wartime seasons.\nThis match took place during the 1942 New Year period at Newlands in Cape Town between Western Province and Transvaal. It ended in a draw. Western Province batted first and scored 237 in 79.1 overs. In reply, James Pickerill's 71 was the top score, and Reginald Lofthouse's 4–63 was the best return as Transvaal made 251 for 8 declared. Sidney Kiel top-scored in the match with 128 not out as Western Province declared on 236 for 8. This didn't quite leave enough time for a result and Transvaal had made 166–6 when stumps were drawn.\nInternational tours of South Africa from 1919–20 to 1944–45.\nAustralian Imperial Forces (AIF) 1919–20.\nThe AIF team had players of the caliber of Jack Gregory, Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield, and Nip Pellew.\nEngland 1924–25.\nA team captained by Lionel Tennyson and including 12 past or future England Test players toured South Africa between November 1924 and February 1925."

For sponsorship reasons, the teams are currently called the Vodacom Bulls and Vodacom Blue Bulls (Afrikaans: Vodacom Blou Bulle).\nHistory.\nThe Blue Bulls (Blue Bulls Rugby Union) or Blou Bulle (Afrikaans) was formed in 1938 as the Northern Transvaal Rugby Union (N.T.R.U.). Prior to the formation of the union, the region's clubs were under the jurisdiction of the then Transvaal Rugby Union (now Golden Lions Rugby Union). Northern Transvaal (under the NTRU), captained by Danie Craven, played its first home game as an independent union on 28 May 1938. The game against the Orange Free State team ended in a draw, 11:11. In its first 75 years, the team competed for the Currie Cup in 55 seasons, and won 23 Currie Cup titles in 53 finals. In the same period 127 Springboks hailed from the Union, and it won 3 Super Rugby titles."

In the bronze medal match, the United States' Monica Seles defeated Australia's Jelena Dokic, 6–1, 6–4. Williams' victory was the third consecutive gold medal in the women's singles for the United States, all by different players (preceded by Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay Davenport).\nThe tournament was held at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre in Sydney, Australia from 19 September until 28 September. There were 64 competitors from 33 nations, with each nation having up to 3 players.\nThe United States' Davenport was the defending gold medalist from 1996, but withdrew from her second round match due to injury.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nReturning from the 1996 Games were gold medalist Lindsay Davenport of the United States, silver medalist (and 1992 bronze medalist) Arantxa Sánchez Vicario of Spain, and three of the four quarterfinal losers (Conchita Martínez of Spain, Iva Majoli of Croatia, and Monica Seles of the United States). Davenport and Seles were joined by Venus Williams, in the middle of a 35-match and 6-tournament winning streak, as the top 3 seeds in the tournament. Sánchez Vicario and Martínez were 4th and 5th; Spain and the United States were favourites.\nColombia, Haiti, Paraguay, Slovenia, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela each made their debut in the event. France made its eighth appearance, most among nations to that point, having missed only the 1908 Games in London (when only British players competed).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were all best-of-three sets. The 12-point tie-breaker was used in any set, except the third, that reached 6–6."

The Colonial Cup was Fiji's first attempt at a professional rugby competition, but it did not draw sufficient crowds and ceased after five seasons.\nHistory.\nIn 2004, with the gap between provincial rugby in Fiji and test rugby at an unacceptable level, the Fiji Rugby Union introduced a brand new, streamlined competition to identify and prepare local players for the international stage. The 30-odd provincial unions were grouped into four franchises along geographical lines. Players not selected for one team could be picked up by one of the others. Players were paid £40 a week plus lodgings.\nThe new competition started on 3 April 2004 and finished 22 May 2004 in time for the international test window. The four teams played a round-robin followed by semi-finals and a grand final. The Coastal Stallions held off a late rally from the Suva Highlanders to claim the inaugural Colonial Cup 26-21\nIn 2005 an extra team was added, Northern Sharks, made of players from Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Ovalau. Previously the Northern Division had belonged to the Suva franchise. Suva Highlanders won the Grand final with a 35-27 win over Western Crusaders.\nIn 2006, with the introduction of a Super 14 style tournament called the Pacific Rugby Cup, the void in the Pacific Island competition pathway between club or provincial rugby in the respective islands and Test rugby was on its way to being filled. Coastal Stallions defeated Suva Highlanders 29-15 in a tough encounter to clinch the 2006 title.\nBligh Roosters joined the 2007 competition, Western Crusaders gave up Tavua, Vatukoula, Ba and Ra to the new franchise.\nIt was announced in 2008 that the competition would cease due to not achieving its player performance aims and low crowds.\nStructure.\nFiji’s best 150 players are divided up into 6 professionally run franchises. These franchises play each other over 10 weeks culminating in a semi-final and final. The league uses 4 points for a win; 2 for a draw; 1 bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match; 1 bonus point for losing by 7 points or less.

        "text": "1895 was the sixth season of County Championship cricket in England. It was the first season in which the official definition of first-class cricket was activated, following the 1894 ruling. Surrey won the championship for the fifth time in six years, despite increased competition, as the tournament was expanded from nine to fourteen teams. The points system was changed as the teams played differing numbers of matches and the new system involved division of the number of points gained by the number of matches that had ended in either a win or a loss. Draws were thus completely disregarded, as they gave zero points. Derbyshire was the best of the rookie teams, finishing in fifth place.\nAnother championship made its bow as this season was the first to stage the Minor Counties Championship. The inaugural title was shared by three teams: Durham, Norfolk and Worcestershire.\nIn the early part of the season, improved batting conditions and long spells of dry weather enabled much heavier scoring than in previous seasons. There were a number of very large scores up until mid-July, when Archie MacLaren played his famous innings of 424 for Lancashire against Somerset at Taunton. After that, rain returned and most pitches from 20 July onwards were \"sticky wickets\", with the result that bowlers dominated the latter part of the season. Charlie Townsend in particular was able to generate prodigious spin of the ball on these treacherous pitches and took 122 wickets in the last 11 county games. Other established bowlers like Peel, Richardson, Mold and Briggs were very difficult to bat against.\nAt the age of 46 (when the season began), W. G. Grace enjoyed a remarkable career revival and was the leading run-scorer in all first-class matches, averaging over 50. He became the first player ever to score 1,000 runs during the month of May and also the first to reach the career landmark of one hundred first-class centuries.\nCounty Championship.\nFinal table.\nPoints system:"

BP has a staff of regular columnists and provides advanced statistics as well as player and team performance projections on the site. Since 1996 the BP staff has also published a \"Baseball Prospectus\" annual as well as several other books devoted to baseball analysis and history.\nBaseball Prospectus has originated several popular new statistical tools that have become hallmarks of baseball analysis. Baseball Prospectus is accredited by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Four of Baseball Prospectus's current regular writers are members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America and thus eligible to vote for nominees for Major League Baseball's post-season awards and the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nProspectus Entertainment Ventures, LLC.\nBaseball Prospectus is formally an entity of Prospectus Entertainment Ventures, LLC, a private corporation that runs websites and publishes books focusing on the statistical analysis of the sports of baseball, basketball, and ice hockey. As of August 2014, the President &amp; CEO is Joe Hamrahi, and Vice President is Dave Pease.\nFor several years, Prospectus Entertainment Ventures (\"PEV\") partnered with Football Outsiders for the publication and promotion of \"Football Outsiders Almanac\" (), before 2009 called \"Pro Football Prospectus\" ().\nOn October 10, 2007, PEV launched \"Basketball Prospectus,\" a new website for the analysis of men's college and pro basketball, with Joe Sheehan taking the role of Managing Editor and announcing the lineup of principal writer-analysts for the site. Initially, this website did not require a subscription for access, but it introduced subscriptions in 2011 for access to most of the material on the site. \"BasketballProspectus.com\"s first annual book, \"College Basketball Prospectus 2008–2009\" (), was published in October 2008. It released \"Pro Basketball Prospectus 2009–10\" for purchase online in October 2009. Subsequently, it published both \"College Basketball Prospectus 2010–11\" () and \"Pro Basketball Prospectus 2010–11\" () in both print and online (PDF) modes.\nOn March 19, 2008, Imagine Sports announced a strategic partnership with PEV and Baseball Prospectus. Imagine sports owns the baseball simulation engine \"Diamond Mind Baseball\".\nOn October 14, 2008, PEV announced the acquisition of \"Baseball Digest Daily\" (BDD), an online blog devoted to baseball analysis and statistics. Joe Hamrahi, new Chief Financial Officer of PEV and founder of BDD, reported that \"PEV's decision to acquire Baseball Digest Daily further enhances the content offerings of Baseball Prospectus by adding some of the game's best analysts as well as over 100 pages of baseball news and original content. In addition, BDD's player tracker provides a platform for serious fans and fantasy baseball enthusiasts to easily monitor the progress of their teams, allowing users to manipulate and track the progress of an unlimited set of players over a customized period of time\".\nAt the same time, PEV revealed publicly that it \"owns a significant interest in 538 \"(www.fivethirtyeight.com)\", a political analysis website that generates over 700,000 unique visitors daily.\"\nOn February 23, 2009, Prospectus Entertainment Ventures (PEV) launched the website \"Puck Prospectus\" with the intent of providing cutting-edge analysis of hockey. Will Carroll assumed the role of the Executive Editor, and Andrew Rothstein, the founder of \"Puck Prospectus\", assumed the role of the Managing Editor. Puck Prospectus published its first annual book, \"Puck Prospectus 2010–2011\" () in both online and print formats. Initially a free site, \"Puck Prospectus\" introduced subscriptions in 2011.\nOn March 24, 2009, Baseball Prospectus announced that Nate Silver was stepping down as its Managing Partner, and Kevin Goldstein was assuming this role. At that time, PEV relinquished its previously announced financial interest in Silver's \"FiveThirtyEight\" blog. At the same time, it was announced that BP has a partnership relationship with ESPN.com.\nIn January 2010, PEV's Managing Partner Kevin Goldstein reported that one of BP's founding members, Joe Sheehan, had departed the organization. He reported that John Perrotto had been elevated to full-time status on the BP staff and would become the new Editor-in-Chief of \"BaseballProspectus.com\", taking over that responsibility from Christina Kahrl. And he reported that Jeff Euston was joining the BP staff and that Euston's \"Cot's Baseball Contracts\" website would be joining the Baseball Prospectus family. In February 2011, Perrotto was replaced as Editor-in-Chief by Steven Goldman.\nIn February 2010, BP's \"Fantasy Manager\" Marc Normandin announced that BP had established a partnership with \"Heater Magazine.\" \"Heater Magazine\" ceased publication after the 2010 season.\nIn November 2011, Kevin Goldstein announced that he was stepping down as PEV's Managing Partner in favor of Joe Hamrahi. On March 3, 2012, Hamrahi announced that Steven Goldman was stepping down as Editor-in-Chief of BaseballProspectus.com; Goldman had taken a position as a lead baseball writer for \"Bleacher Report\". Ben Lindbergh was named Managing Editor of Baseball Prospectus on March 5, 2012 and Editor-in-Chief of Baseball Prospectus on July 13, 2012.\nOn April 30, 2012, PEV's Managing Partner Joe Hamrahi announced that \"Dan Brooks, Harry Pavlidis, and Brooks Baseball have agreed to team up and join forces with Baseball Prospectus. BrooksBaseball.net is the premier site for PITCHf/x analysis and pitch classification\".\nOn March 15, 2013, after explaining a week earlier that its key staff of writers had been hired away by ESPN, Baseball Prospectus's Dave Pease declared in response to a question in the comments: \"Basketball Prospectus will not be publishing any new content. We are going quiet. The archives will remain available. Thank you\". On March 8, Pease had written: \"You've probably noticed our Basketball Prospectus Premium coverage has been pretty quiet lately. You may have also noticed that our core pro writers, Kevin Pelton, Bradford Doolittle, and John Gasaway are now writing for ESPN Insider on a regular basis. Late last year, we learned that, following their completion of the Pro Basketball Prospectus 2012–13 and College Basketball Prospectus 2012–13 annuals, Kevin, Bradford, and John would be moving to ESPN on a full-time basis\".\nHistory.\nBaseball Prospectus was founded in 1996 by Gary Huckabay, who recruited the initial contributor group of Clay Davenport, Rany Jazayerli, Christina Kahrl, and Joe Sheehan, with the publication of the first annual set of forecasts. \"That first year, BP charged $20 for a statistics guide produced on a photocopier. It printed around 300 copies and sold about 170 to fellow statheads, even though the book was missing the St. Louis Cardinals. 'It was terrible,' recalls Kahrl, 'but it nevertheless didn't discourage us.' Within a few years Brassey's Inc. published the guide, which grew to about 3,000 copies. By 2007 it reached \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, topping 70,000 copies at $21.95 a pop.\"\nThe kind of sabermetric approach favored by Baseball Prospectus has gained significant acceptance by the management of many Major League Baseball clubs, notably the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. BP has often been considered the modern successor to Bill James' \"Baseball Abstract\" series of books in the 1980s.\nReflecting its legacy as a group of sabermetricians who met over the Internet, BP has no \"main office.\" Working for BP is a second or part-time job for many of the regular staff, who conduct their work for BP in their own home offices.\nThe website \"BaseballProspectus.com\" began in 1997 primarily as a way to present original sabermetric research; publish advanced baseball statistics such as EqA, the Davenport Translations (DT's), and VORP; and promote sales of the annual book. Beginning in 2003, the site placed most of its new articles, its PECOTA forecasts, and some of its statistical databases in a \"premium\" section that could be accessed only by subscription. However, in May 2011, BP \"announced it has made its entire archive of premium and fantasy content over one year old completely and permanently free to the public\".\nUntil 2007, when the site began to post general advertising, the premium subscriptions and book sales were Baseball Prospectus' main source of revenues. Baseball Prospectus does not publish a financial report or information about its subscriber base, but it appears to have used its income to expand its breadth of coverage, and it has not increased its subscription prices since initiating its premium service. It also offers a subscription to those interested in fantasy baseball, at a lower price than the premium subscriptions and giving access to fewer features and articles.\n\"BaseballProspectus.com\" has a corps of staff writers who publish articles on a regular (typically weekly) basis under a featured heading. In addition, occasional articles are published by other BP staff or freelance authors. Some former regular writers no longer appear on the site but are employed on the staffs of major league baseball organizations, including as of 2014 Keith Woolner (Cleveland Indians), James Click (Tampa Bay Rays and others), Dan Fox (Pittsburgh Pirates), Mike Fast (Houston Astros), Kevin Goldstein (Houston Astros), and Colin Wyers (Houston Astros). In addition, Keith Law, now a columnist for The Athletic, in 2002 moved from Baseball Prospectus to work on player evaluation in the front office of the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2009, Nate Silver turned his full attention to his FiveThirtyEight political analysis website; he resigned his executive post at BP and handed over management of PECOTA to other BP staff.\nGiven the competing career opportunities for some of BP's best-known and most statistics-savvy analysts, maintaining a fresh supply of sabermetrically sophisticated writers remains a challenge. During the 2009 baseball season, BP ran a multi-week open talent search competition in the spirit of the popular television program \"American Idol\", in which aspiring writers submitted articles for evaluation by BP's staff members, with one contestant a week from among the final ten selected by the staff then voted off by the subscribers. At least three new regular BP writers (winner Ken Funck, Tim Kniker, and Matt Swartz) were discovered through this \"Prospectus Idol\" contest. In addition, BP had added Eric Seidman to its staff early in 2009 and then acquired Russell Carleton (\"Pizza Cutter\") and Colin Wyers in December 2009 to bolster its coverage of technical sabermetric issues. As late as the Fall of 2008, Seidman, Swartz, Carleton, Wyers, Daniel Novick and BP Idol finalist Brian Cartwright made up the entire staff of \"Statistically Speaking\" aka StatSpeak at MVN.com. Carleton left the BP staff in May 2010, but returned in July 2012. Seidman and Swartz left in February 2011.\nWyers was hired away by the Houston Astros in October 2013. In the press release announcing his hire, Jeff Luhnow noted, \"Colin Wyers is a brilliant man with lots of well thought-out, practical, ideas. He is insuring the financial security of this company for years to come. Oh yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach\". Wyers' final article for BP reviewed the history and process of the \"brain drain\" of sabermetricians as writers to baseball analytics specialists working for Major League Baseball itself: \"Colleges can crank out people who know and understand the tools, but the sabermetrics community has given teams people who have demonstrated that they can use those tools to find useful insights into the game of baseball. So teams court them as part of their effort to win games\".\nAlthough the site maintains a strong sabermetric core and has expanded its statistical databases, it regularly attends to issues such as baseball prospects (the First Year Player Draft and minor league baseball), international baseball, the economics and business of baseball (valuation of players, team and stadium finances, the player marketplace), and fantasy baseball (PECOTA, the \"Fantasy Focus\" series of articles, forecast manager and other fantasy tools). BP HAS also published monographs on specialized topics, including the application of sabermetric analysis to historical topics – an emphasis clearly seen in \"Mind Game\" (2005 – a history of the Boston Red Sox), \"Baseball Between the Numbers\" (2006 – which addresses some historical comparisons), and \"It Ain't Over 'til It's Over\" (2007 – about historical pennant races).\nBy the beginning of the 2011 baseball season, none of BP's founders was an active contributor to the website or publications, though some of their earlier articles were included in two \"Best of Baseball Prospectus\" compendia that were published in 2011.\nProducts.\nBaseball Prospectus creates several products:\nTheories.\nBaseball Prospectus writers promote several theories on proper baseball management and analysis, many of which are contrary to those of conventional baseball wisdom.\nClutch hitting.\nBaseball Prospectus researchers have concluded that there is no repeatable ability of clutch hitting. As writer Joe Sheehan said, \"Over the course of a game, a month, a season or a career, there is virtually no evidence that any player or group of players possesses an ability to outperform his established level of ability in clutch situations, however defined.\" They cite studies which find that there is insignificant correlation between year-to-year performance in clutch situations.\nIn an article published in 2006, Nate Silver argued that clutch hitting ability does exist to a degree. He argued that although not as important as traditional baseball analysis would suggest, clutch hitting ability was more significant than other sabermetric studies had shown. The article also found there to be a connection between clutch hitting ability and situational hitting, or the ability to adjust a hitting approach to fit the given situation.\nViews on traditional statistics.\nBaseball Prospectus writers often successfully argue that traditional baseball statistics such as RBIs, wins, and batting average are poor reflections of a player's true contributions. For example, they have argued that RBIs are too dependent on factors outside of the player's control, namely the production of other hitters in the lineup. They similarly argue that wins are too affected by factors such as the team's offense and bullpen.\nCloser usage.\nBaseball Prospectus writers assert that teams are typically inefficient in their use of their best relievers. Teams typically assign their most effective reliever to the position of closer, using him in only save situations. According to many Baseball Prospectus writers, a team's best reliever should be used when the opposing team has its best chance at increasing its chances of winning.\nViews on sacrifice bunts and stolen bases.\nMany writers argue that the sacrifice bunt and stolen base are overused in baseball. Teams will often attempt these plays when the score is close. Writers for Baseball Prospectus often argue that teams are, on average, actually lowering their expected number of runs scored. They argue that stolen base attempts are not completed frequently enough for them to be beneficial to the offense. For sacrifice bunts, they argue that the team is giving up more by sacrificing an out than they gain by advancing a runner one base. Their thinking is derived from the grid of expected runs in an inning based on the outs and runner situation, which shows that the sacrifice is detrimental to a team given average players in most of the situations in which it is typically used.\nIn a series of articles in 2004, James Click argued that sacrifice bunts are beneficial in some situations, dependent on the quality of the batter at the plate and the situation in the game.\nStatistical tools.\nBaseball Prospectus writers use a wide variety of sabermetric tools. Among the major tools that they are credited with inventing are:\nVoros McCracken's pathbreaking article on Defense Independent Pitching Statistics also first appeared on the BP website.\nNotable contributors.\nContributors to Baseball Prospectus include multiple notable sports figures, including:\nCriticism.\nCriticism of methodology.\nBaseball Prospectus, as well as other sabermetric analysts, are criticized for taking the human aspect out of the game of baseball. For example, Murray Chass of \"The New York Times\" wrote in an article that he did not want to hear or read about new-age baseball statistics any more (referencing Value over replacement player specifically), saying: \nNate Silver, BP's Managing Partner at the time, responded to this criticism in \"An Open Letter to Murray Chass,\" including offering to meet Chass to watch a ballgame. Silver expounded on the case for a positive impact of sabermetrics on the game of baseball in an article \"How Sabermetrics Helps Build a Better Ballgame,\" published on \"Baseball Analysts.com\".\nAnother type of criticism comes from those who believe that by broadening its coverage and audience, Baseball Prospectus is becoming more like the mainstream media and losing what made it unique. In response to a question along this line in an on-line chat, Silver wrote:\nCriticism of journalistic standards.\nBaseball Prospectus was widely criticized for publishing and aggressively promoting a 2003 story claiming that banished player/manager Pete Rose had reached an agreement to return to baseball. Will Carroll made the rounds on television and radio, claiming to have spoken to unnamed sources who had actually seen the agreement. Spokesmen for both Rose and Major League Baseball refuted the claim, but Carroll and his colleagues insisted their reporting was accurate. No other news source confirmed the story. In fact, Rose was not reinstated and remains banned from baseball."

        "title": "South Africa Academy cricket team in Pakistan in 2005–06",
        "text": "The South African Academy team toured Pakistan for cricket matches against the Pakistan Academy in August 2005. The Academy team was made up of players aged around 20, who are all with the South African National Cricket Academy as trainees. Only one - Jean-Paul Duminy - had any international experience from before, having toured Sri Lanka in 2004. The Pakistan Academy, meanwhile, consisted of a similarly young team, with one player having Test experience. There were two four-day matches and three one-day matches scheduled. The four-day matches did not have first class status, nor did the one-day matches have List A status. The Academy teams are not to be confused with A teams, which are second-tier teams, while these seem to have their focus on youth cricket. Pakistan Academy dominated the series, only losing the final match, when the one-day series was already decided. They won the four-day series 1–0 and the one-day series 2–1.\nMatch details.\nFirst 4-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (11–13 August).\nPakistan Academy won by nine wickets\nAfter the first two days at National Stadium were closely fought, the tourists imploded to hand Pakistan the victory and a 1–0 lead in the 2-match series. It had started well for South Africa, which Myles Williamson - without any first-class experience - making 31, while Thandi Tshabalala and Jean-Paul Duminy made fifties. At 174 for 3, South Africa looked confident, but Pakistan fought back. Yasir Ali ripped through the lower order with six wickets, all caught behind, lbw or bowled, as South Africa were all out for 248, Duminy left stranded on 82 not out. South Africa's fielding effort started well, with Ugasen Govender taking three wickets as Pakistan crawled to 84 for 5, but thanks to 19-year-old Zulqarnain Haider, who made 76, the innings was turned around. South Africa still led by 12 after the first innings, which was completed eight overs into day three, but Yasir continued with his good bowling, and wicket-keeper Zulqarnain held four catches as South Africa crawled to 118 - Vaughn van Jaarsveld the only batsman to pass 20 with his 46. Pakistan were set 131 to win, and did it with ease, Shahid Yousuf scoring 83 not out as they passed the target with nine wickets to spare. Cricketarchive scorecard\nSecond 4-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (18–21 August).\nMatch drawn\nDespite declaring twice in an attempt to get a result, the South African team was very nearly beaten in this match at Gaddafi Stadium. Having won the toss and chosen to bat, they immediately lost two wickets to their tormentor, Yasir Ali, and at 121 for 5 things looked grim. However, Jean-Paul Duminy played what is possibly his highest innings of his career, flaying the Pakistani bowlers for an incredible 265 not out - well supported by Ryan Canning, who notched up 112 runs before captain Francois du Plessis declared. With the total 470 for 5 - the partnership having added 349 runs together - South Africa managed to dig into the Pakistani batsmen at regular intervals on day three, and despite 85 from Shahid Yousuf they could only post 303. Ugasen Govender and Vernon Philander both got figures of three wickets for 43. In reply, South Africa made hay quickly, scoring 162 for 5 in 34 overs and giving themselves plenty of time to bowl Pakistan out - setting them what was thought to be a challenging target of 330. However, despite four wickets from Morné Morkel, Shahid Yousuf and Hasan Raza made centuries, and when the final over of the day was bowled, the hosts needed 13 runs to complete the whitewash and win the series 2-0. They could only make six - however, they still took the series, with 1-0 in two Tests. Cricketarchive scorecard\nFirst 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (24 August).\nPakistan Academy won by 84 runs\nPakistan Academy continued their good run, winning the first of three one-day games. In these games, 12 players could be named, but only 11 could bat, meaning that a team could choose to pick one player to only bowl. Hasan Raza, coming off an unbeaten century in the four-day game, continued to impress, hitting a well-paced 70 as Pakistan Academy made their way to 244 for 8. The South African reply was stopped dead by pacer Mohammad Irshad, who took six for 21 as the South Africans collapsed to 160. Irshad's first two wickets were number two Coetzee and number three Smit, both bowled for 0 and 2 respectively. Cricketarchive scorecard\nSecond 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa Academy (26 August).\nPakistan Academy won by 39 runs\nPakistan Academy secured the series with a 39-run win at the Gaddafi Stadium, going up 2–0 in the three-game series. Having been put in to bat by the South African captain, the Pakistani openers Agha Sabir and Khurram Manzoor added 140 for the first wicket. Despite three wickets from Mario Olivier, and two run outs, Pakistan still managed 280 before being bowled out nine balls short of the 50 over limit. South Africa got off to a poor start when Irshad had Williamson bowled for a two-ball duck in the first over, but Francois du Plessis and Ryan Canning put them back on track with a fine fifth-wicket partnership worth 80. When that partnership was broken, however, the tourists collapsed, ending on 241 all out. \nCricketarchive scorecard\nThird 1-day match, Pakistan Academy v South Africa (28 August).\nSouth Africa Academy won by 4 runs (D/L method)\nIn a match reduced by rain, the South African Academy came back to record their first victory of the tour in the final game. Winning the toss and opting to bat at the Sheikhupura Stadium in Lahore, they lost Tshabalala early, but Williamson and Smit sent them back on track with a 61-run partnership. The middle and lower order then smacked the bowlers about, van Jaarsveld and Phangiso hitting three sixes between them in quickfire innings, as South Africa closed on 164 for 9. Mansoor Amjad took four wickets for Pakistan, but conceded 57 runs from five overs in the process. Due to rain having interrupted South Africa's innings, Pakistan were set 176 to win, and were in trouble early as Philander and Govender took wickets to peg them back to 12 for 3. Hasan Raza made another big innings, with 67 not out, but could not hit quickly enough as Pakistan fell five runs short of the target, ending on 171 for 5.\nCricketarchive scorecard"

He is married with a daughter and works as a managing director of an advertising and marketing agency in Leicester and as a part-time BBC Sport summariser.\nHe marked the start of his career with impressive try scoring feats (2 on debut and another in his second test) but was controversially dropped from the England side after his 3rd test in favour of Tony Underwood following the 10–9 loss to Wales.\nHe did not feature regularly for the England side after that but played numerous games for Northampton Saints and was selected for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand. However, injury cruelly struck on the Lions Tour and he was the first player sent home through injury when he dislocated his shoulder in a tackle in the first game against Northland.\nHis seventh and final appearance for England came against France in the 1995 World Cup.\nHis shoulder never properly healed enough to stand the demands of top class rugby and he retired from the game in 2001.\nIan was noted throughout his career for being remarkably fit – in 1993 he finished top of the England Squad on the much-vaunted VO2 test."

He played as a lock or flanker, featuring for Sale Sharks and Worcester Warriors in the English Premiership and Yorkshire Carnegie in the RFU Championship.\nHis rugby union career blossomed at Stockport Grammar School. He went on to take a Business Studies course at Sheffield Hallam University and was two years into it when the Sale Sharks invited him to join them. He played for Cheshire at U18 and U20 level, then briefly with Fylde before joining Sale Sharks.\nHe made a startling rise to the England Sevens squad, and was nominated for the 2003 PRA Young Player of the Year Award. He was part of the England A team that beat France A, Scotland A and Italy A in their 2003 Six Nations and also went on the unbeaten England tour to North America and Japan that year.\nHe played for England in the uncapped match against the Barbarians at Twickenham in May 2003.\nThe year 2004 marked another leap forward. He was called up to the senior team by then head coach Clive Woodward from the start of the Six Nations. He came off the bench against Italy for his debut cap and scored a try. This earned him a starting position against Scotland as a flanker and again against Wales from where he continued to impress. He was selected for the 2004 Summer tour, starting against the All Blacks in Dunedin in the first Test.\nSale Sharks director of rugby Kingsley Jones referred to him as 'the most hard done-by player in England' after he was hardly used during the 2005 Autumn test series.\nJones went on to collect more caps on the 2006 Summer tour of Australia and 2007 Summer tour of South Africa.\nIn the 2005–2006 season, Jones started the final as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. He was also voted Sale's player of the year in 2006 and again in 2008.\nOn 22 May 2014, Jones officially joined Yorkshire Carnegie in the RFU Championship on a two-year contract from the 2014–15 season.\nOn 19 May 2016 Jones announced his retirement from rugby after suffering a concussion against Nottingham in April of that year.\nPersonal life.\nJones married Donna on 28 June 2008 at Dromoland Castle, County Clare, Ireland.

        "title": "Philadelphia Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Philadelphia Cricket Club, founded in 1854, is the oldest country club in the United States. It has two locations: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, and Flourtown, Pennsylvania.\nHistory.\nFounded on February 10, 1854, the Philadelphia Cricket Club is the oldest country club in the United States. As the name indicates, the club was formed by a group of young men of English ancestry who had played the game of cricket as students at the University of Pennsylvania. With the wish to continue to play together after their graduation, they formed the club under the leadership of William Rotch Wister.\nFor the first 30 years of the club's existence, the club did not own any grounds and thus played cricket on any grounds available, such as at Camden, New Jersey. Then, in 1883, the club “came home” to Chestnut Hill due to the generosity of a benefactor, Henry H. Houston. Houston arranged for them to settle down at the club's present location on West Willow Grove Avenue in the St. Martins section of Chestnut Hill.\nLocation.\nThe Philadelphia Cricket Club has two locations. The original location in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia where the main offices are located, along with the tennis courts, squash facilities, an eight-lane twenty-five meter swimming pool, and a short nine-hole golf course. The second location is ten minutes away in Whitemarsh Township, near Flourtown, which holds two 18-hole golf courses.\nSports.\nGolf.\nWhen the Golf Association of Philadelphia was organized in 1897, the club was one of four founding members with Merion, Philadelphia Country Club and Aronimink. Both the Wissahickon and Militia Hill courses have been recognized for their outstanding layouts and course conditions over the years. (Wissahickon has been named a top-100 classic course multiple times and Militia Hill a top-25 golf course in Pennsylvania).\nSt. Martins Course.\nThe original nine-hole course was built in 1895 by famed architect Willie Tucker (St. Andrew's Golf Club, Sand Point Country Club and Argyle Country Club) and was quickly replaced by a new eighteen-hole course in 1897. The old eighteen-hole course, known as St. Martins and now playing as a nine-hole layout, hosted the United States Open Championship in 1907 and 1910. The 1907 winner was Alec Ross, brother of famed architect Donald Ross, who chalked up a remarkable score of 302 for 72 holes. It was also during this championship that the first hole-in-one in U.S. Open competition was achieved by Jack Hobens. The 1910 Open victory went to Alex Smith, who shot 71 on the final day. Also entered that year was Cricket Club's own professional, Scottish-born Willie Anderson, one of four golfers who have won the U.S. Open four times. Anderson remains the only person to win in three consecutive years. This course is named \"St. Martins\" after the adjacent episcopal church, St. Martin-in-the-Fields. In 2015 the St Martins course was sold to the club by the Woodward Family as part of an open space initiative. Hosted the World Hickory Championship in 2016 &amp; the National Hickory Championship in 2017 on the St Martins course.\n\"U.S. Open Champions and Scores\"\n\"Course Scorecard\"\nWissahickon Course.\nA large tract of land was purchased in 1920, because the Club did not own the grounds on which the St. Martins golf course was built. It was A. W. Tillinghast (Bethpage – Black, Baltusrol, Newport, San Francisco and Winged Foot) who recommended the Flourtown site and who designed the new course, which opened in 1922. The Wissahickon course is one of the few remaining courses designed by Tillinghast that has had minimal changes over the past 80 years. The name \"Wissahickon\" comes from the Lenape word for \"Catfish Stream.\" The Wissahickon Creek runs adjacent to the course. Lorraine Run, which eventually dumps into the Wissahickon Creek, runs through the Wissahickon course. An abandoned Reading Railroad track runs through the course, along the 6th and 11th holes.\nOn June 18, 2013, construction was started on a complete restoration of the Wissahickon course, led by designer Keith Foster and Director of Grounds Dan Meersman.\nSince the completion of the 2014 renovation, \"Wissahickon\" has hosted the 2014 Philadelphia Open, the 2015 PGA Professional National Championship (With Militia Hill), the 2016 Constellation Senior Players Championship, and will host the 2024 U.S. Amateur Four-Ball (originally scheduled for 2020, but deferred to 2024 by the USGA after cancellation). The course is dedicated to A.W. Tillinghast, who was a long-time member of the Philadelphia Cricket Club and a native of Philadelphia.\n\"Course Scorecard\"\nMilitia Hill Course.\nIn 1999, the Board of Governors made a decision to begin the development of a third golf course located on land acquired in the original purchase of the Flourtown property nearly eighty years before. After submissions by several top designers, the club selected Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry, who had already designed a number of highly rated courses throughout the United States and Canada (Erin Hills, Calusa Pines, Hamilton Farms and Naples National). The club named the new course ‘Militia Hill’ in honor of the adjacent Militia Hill section of Fort Washington State Park, which had been occupied during the American Revolution by the Pennsylvania Militia just before moving on to their legendary winter encampment at Valley Forge. Like the Wissahickon course, a train track runs through the middle of the golf course. Although this line is active, and golfers pass through a tunnel (which was constructed well before the golf course) twice each round. The course is dedicated to Willie Anderson, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, who at one point, early in the 20th century, was the head golf professional at the club.\n\"Course Scorecard\"\nCricket.\nThe cricket team was initially disbanded in 1924 but was later revived in 1998. The club is now one of the hosts of the annual Philadelphia International Cricket Festival.\nSquash.\nEight singles courts and two hardball doubles courts round out PCC's squash program. Rich Wade is the director of squash. PCC has coached many national champions and countless players who went on to play intercollegiate squash.\nSwimming.\nIn 2019 PCC won the Country Club Swim Association of Greater Philadelphia League Championship.\nIn 2006 the swimming team placed fourth at the Country Club Swimming Association of Greater Philadelphia's League Championships led by the William Penn Charter's high school swimming coach Kevin Berkoff.\nTennis – Lawn, Pickleball, &amp; Platform.\nIn 1881, the club was one of the founding members of the United States Lawn Tennis Association, today the USTA. The club hosted the inaugural U.S. Women's National Singles Championship in 1887, and continued to host the event until 1921, when it moved to Forest Hills. The Women's National Doubles Championship (which started in 1889) and Mixed Doubles Championship (which started in 1892) were also held at the club until 1921. These events later combined with the men's singles and doubles championships to form the U.S. Open.\nAnnually, the club hosts the USTA 30-35 and 70s age group championships.\nThe club operates 18 rotating grass courts, nine HydroClay courts, and two indoor hard courts.\nPlatform Tennis.\nIn 2014, the platform tennis hut was listed as one of the most impressive by \"Town &amp; Country\". The club hosted the 2017 Philly Cricket Invitational for American Platform Tennis Association finals and was one of the National Championship hosts.\nThe club has 4 permanent platform tennis courts.\nPickleball.\nPickleball became a prominent sport at PCC in 2019. Constructing six outdoor courts and eight temporary indoor courts on the indoor tennis courts.\nTrapshooting.\nDue to the extensive efforts in recent years of the Trapshooting Committee, trapshooting has become a thriving sport at PCC. Competitions are held November through April at clubs around the Philadelphia region."

        "text": "Glen John Murray (born November 1, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins and Los Angeles Kings. He is currently the Director of Player Development for the Kings.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Murray was raised in the Bridgewater area and played junior hockey for the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Murray spent three seasons with the Wolves, putting up 84 points in his final year.\nMurray was a first-round draft pick, 18th overall by the Bruins in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. He spent four seasons with the Bruins before being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins with Bryan Smolinski for Kevin Stevens and Shawn McEachern. Murray's stay with the Penguins only lasted a little over a year and he was eventually on the move again; this time he was traded to Los Angeles Kings for Ed Olczyk. Murray enjoyed moderate success with the Kings, picking up some good numbers during his five-year stay, but on October 24, 2001, Murray would once again find himself in the middle of a trade. Murray was traded back to the Boston Bruins with Jozef Stümpel for Jason Allison and Mikko Eloranta.\nIn July 2002, Murray signed a two-year contract with the Bruins.\nMurray enjoyed his greatest offensive season in 2002–03, scoring 92 points (44 goals and 48 assists) for the Bruins and earning a spot in the 2003 NHL All-Star Game.\nIn August 2005, Murray signed a four-year, $16.6 million contract extension with the Bruins.\nIn November 2008, Murray had ankle surgery, claiming it was a result of an injury he sustained during play of the 2007–08 NHL season. As a result, his agent filed a claim against the Boston Bruins. The Bruins ended up winning arbitration and on July 23, 2008, Murray was placed on waivers by the Bruins. Three days later, on July 26, the Bruins announced the buyout of Murray's contract to free up salary cap room.\nInternational play.\nMurray was selected to play for Team Canada at the 1998 World Championships held in Zürich and Basel in Switzerland. He played in 5 games and scored 1 goal and 2 assists as Canada finished in 6th place. He was then called up to the roster again in 2004 and scored 2 goals and 2 assists as he helped Canada capture the gold medal. "

        "title": "Women's National Basketball League",
        "text": "The Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) is the pre-eminent professional women's basketball league in Australia. It is currently composed of eight teams. The league was founded in 1981 and is the women's counterpart to the National Basketball League (NBL). Several WNBL teams have NBL counterparts. The Adelaide Lightning, Melbourne Boomers, Perth Lynx, Southside Flyers and Sydney Uni Flames are the current WNBL teams sharing a market with an NBL team (the Townsville Fire and University of Canberra Capitals shared a market with the Townsville Crocodiles and Canberra Cannons respectively, before both NBL clubs became defunct). The current league champions are the Townsville Fire, who won their fourth title in 2023.\nHistory.\nFounding of the WNBL.\nIn August 1980, West Adelaide Bearcat Coach Ted Powell, after an encouraging exchange of letters with St Kilda's Coach Bill Palmer, called a meeting at the Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide. In attendance were Ted, North Adelaide Coach Kay McFarlane and Noarlunga Coach Brendan Flynn. At this meeting it was decided to approach three Victorian teams (St Kilda, CYMS and Nunawading) with the idea of forming a home and away Interstate Competition.\nThe six teams' delegates all met and confirmed the new League at the Town and Country Motel in Sydney during the 1980 Australian Club Championships.\nThe meeting resolved to form a two-round competition between these teams to be held in July and August in 1981. The basis for the idea was that many of the top sides in both States wanted a varied competition from their standard State League as well as a suitable preparation for the Australian Club Championship, which was held on an annual basis for the top 24 teams in the country. There was also much excitement with the formation of the Men's National League in 1979 and the women felt that one of the best ways to develop the game was to provide more opportunities for the best players and clubs to play against each other more regularly.\nA major consideration was finance and with this in mind the competition was formed with the six teams with a full home and away series between all teams with three games on one weekend to save costs. The NSW based clubs of Bankstown and Sutherland were not happy to be left out due to costs and offered to pay their own way to Melbourne and Adelaide where they would play each team once for double points.\nAnd so the WNBL was born. Reference. (Boti Nagy. \"High flyers: women's basketball in Australia\" 1990. Sun Books)\nIn 1981, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) was also opened and the men's head coach Dr. Adrian Hurley (who was to lead the Australian Boomers in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics) contacted the clubs and asked whether the AIS could also participate in the competition to commence later that year.\nThe nine teams in the inaugural season of the league were: AIS, Bankstown Bruins, Catholic Young Men's Society (CYMS), Melbourne Telstars, Noarlunga Tigers, North Adelaide Rockets, St. Kilda Saints, Sutherland Sharks and West Adelaide Bearcats. The competition commenced on 19 June 1981 with the first game to be played in Adelaide between the AIS and West Adelaide. The competition was called the Women's Interstate Basketball Conference with each team paying the sum of $25 to be a part of the WIBC – giving a central fund of $200 to conduct the competition.\n1981–1985: early years.\nThe inaugural winner was St. Kilda who defeated the North Adelaide Rockets 77–58. St. Kilda also went on to win the Victorian State Championship and the Australian Club Championship in Melbourne, defeating Bankstown Bruins in the final. St. Kilda had three Australian representatives in Tracy Morris, Karen Ogden and Patricia Cockrem. Ogden became the national league's first dual Most Valuable Player award winner when she took the individual trophy in 1982 (the first season it was presented) and again in 1983.\nIn 1982, the competition expanded into another state with the entry of a combined Brisbane team. The new revised program saw Victorian teams travelling to NSW and AIS, and NSW teams travelling to South Australia and South Australian teams travelling to Victoria. It was not a full home and away competition but the beginnings of what was to come in the future. The competition also changed its name to the more appropriate Women's Basketball League. St. Kilda repeated in 1982 with a grand final win over Bankstown – the men's team also won the first two NBL titles, which showed the strength of St. Kilda at that time.\nIn 1983, Nunawading Spectres led by Robyn Maher easily defeated St. Kilda and went on to win nine WNBL titles during the next 12 years. During the 1983 Australian Club Championships, a workshop was held to discuss women's basketball and from that meeting came the decision to bring together a second tier of clubs to form the Women's Conference. There were now 20 women's teams playing in a home and away competition, which immediately improved the standard of women's basketball in Australia.\nWith the NBL finally riding the crest of a sudden wave of popularity, media interest in the women's league also was on the increase. Most clubs were recognising the need to promote themselves and the image of the league. Double header matches with the men's NBL and with South East Basketball League games – a secondary men's interstate competition – pushed the women's game before a wider spectator audience unfamiliar with the quality of women's basketball. In 1985, the two competitions continued to work together to improve women's basketball and recognised the need to promote the competition and the individual clubs and athletes. Hobart was winners of the second conference and was keen to enter the main competition, however this was not to be until 1986.\n1986–1989: league expansion and growth.\nWhen Perth admitted a team for the 1986 Women's Basketball Conference, the two women's leagues could rightfully claim that between them they had a truly national competition. The Australian Basketball Federation approved the WBL's application to be renamed the National Women's Basketball League and a new era was underway. 1986 was also the first year that the WNBL played its first full home and away competition and next year, Perth sought a position in the number league. Perth's inclusion was on the basis that they paid their own airfares in the first two years to earn their position.\nFollowing the success of the Seoul Olympics, the WNBL was ready to enter a new era and appointed Lyn Palmer in the newly created full-time general manager position. Lyn Palmer, who had just retired after a distinguished playing career with St. Kilda, Nunawading and Coburg, was looking for a change whilst her husband Bill was general manager of the men's NBL.\nIn 1989, the WNBL gained its first sponsorship in \"Pony\", one of Australia's leading sporting apparel companies at the time for $258,000 and ABC agreed to cover the finals series. The women's game in Australia was on the move – there were 13 teams in the WNBL for the 1989 season, with the Bankstown Bruins changing their name to the Sydney Bruins to try to gain more market exposure in Australia's largest city.\n1990s: continued growth.\nThe next few years saw the league continue to grow with Australia being awarded the Women's World Championships in 1994. The pressure was now on to ensure that women's basketball gained a profile in the country, and in 1993, the WNBL teams agreed to contribute some money to enable the game to be televised on a weekly basis by ABC. This was the break through that the sport needed and also coincided with the Sydney Kings taking over the ownership of the Sydney Bruins and the formation of the Sydney Flames.\nCoached by Carrie Graf, the Flames became one of Australia's most popular women's sporting teams. The Perth Breakers led the way with the bodysuit in the early 1990s whilst the Flames continued to modify the suit, winning the title in 1993 and gaining back page coverage on the Sydney newspapers, a feat never envisaged back in the early 1980s.\nThe 1990s were dominated by Sydney, Melbourne Tigers, Adelaide Lightning and Canberra. The AIS won their first title in the first summer season of 1998–99 led by one of the best basketballers in the world, Lauren Jackson.\nJan Morris continued as the President (10 years as President is recognised as an outstanding contribution to the WNBL) of the League and in 1995 Leeanne Grantham (née Christie) became the Chief Executive. Throughout the mid-late 1990s (and into the early 2000s) the WNBL brand became the most well known women's sport brand in Australia, it was also recognised as one of the top 3 leading women's basketball leagues in the world.\nThe ABC televised weekly WNBL games and broadcast the 1994 Women's World Championships held in Australia, this provided women's basketball with the type of profile required to help secure significant sponsorship enabling the League to reduce the travel pool and to continue to build on the WNBL Brand.\n2000s.\nThe ABC continued to televise the league despite some difficulties in mid-2001 when the ABC contemplated changing their televising of sport. A successful partnership between the WNBL and Netball Australia subsequently saw both sports retained on ABC. ABC undertook to increase their coverage by showing Friday night games live on ABC digital television as well as a replay in the regular Saturday afternoon slot.\nThe WNBL was very stable with eight teams for a number of seasons with Tasmania and Northern Territory not represented. In 2006, Bendigo, through the efforts of a strong community focus for women's basketball, commenced discussions with Basketball Australia about entering a team for the 2007–08 season. At the same time, Basketball New Zealand had discussions with Basketball Australia about a team from New Zealand entering the next season.\nIn October 2006, the decision was made to welcome two new teams into the WNBL for the 2007–08 season in Bendigo Spirit and Christchurch Sirens. Bendigo brought excellent community support into the league, whilst Christchurch had a number of the New Zealand Tall Ferns on their roster to begin. One of the strategic objectives of the WNBL was to see a second team out of Queensland from the south and after some very effective feasibility work, Logan Basketball Association were successful in being admitted into the 2008–09 season with the Logan Thunder.\nIn 2013, the Adelaide Lightning merged into a partnership with the NBL's Adelaide 36ers which sees the two clubs sharing management and marketing departments, as well as use of the 8,000 seat Adelaide Arena, the largest venue currently used in the WNBL. The collaboration of WNBL and NBL teams from the same city is seen as a way of raising the public profile of both the WNBL and the Lightning, with several Lightning home games played before 36ers games in cross-promoted double headers ensuring the women's game often finishes in front of crowds in excess of 5,000.\nA February 2023 match between the Southside Flyers and the Sydney Flames drew a crowd of 7,681, which is the largest ever WNBL crowd.\nSeason format.\nRegular season.\nThe WNBL regular season typically begins in early October and concludes in mid to late February. During the regular season, each team plays 24 games, 12 home and away. Each team plays each other at least three times, and some of the teams four times. The top four teams in on the Championship ladder move on to the WNBL Finals, usually taking place in March.\nAfter April, teams hold training camps. Training camps allow the coaching staff to prepare the players for the regular season, and determine the roster with which they will begin the regular season. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.\nWNBL finals.\nThe top four teams at the end of the regular season advances to the finals. The teams finishing in the first and second positions at the completion of the regular season receive home advantage in their three-game first-round match-up against the teams finishing in fourth and third positions respectively. The winners of these series advance to the grand final. With home advantage being awarded to the highest remaining seed, the winner of the three-game grand final series is crowned as WNBL champion.\n! style=\"width:4%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Champions\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Format\n! style=\"width:3%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Result\n! style=\"width:8%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Finals MVP\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:4%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Champions\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Format\n! style=\"width:3%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Result\n! style=\"width:8%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Finals MVP\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:4%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Champions\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Format\n! style=\"width:3%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Result\n! style=\"width:8%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Finals MVP\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:4%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Champions\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Format\n! style=\"width:3%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Result\n! style=\"width:8%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Finals MVP\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:4%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Champions\n! style=\"width:16%;\" colspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Format\n! style=\"width:3%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Result\n! style=\"width:8%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Finals MVP\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Team\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Coach\nPlayers and Coaches.\nOver the years the success of the Opals has been vitally linked to the success of the WNBL. The WNBL has seen the development of famous Opals such as Robyn Maher, Michele Timms, Karen Dalton, Rachael Sporn, Shelley Sandie, Julie Nykiel, Jenny Whittle, Lauren Jackson and Penny Taylor. All have represented Australia with distinction and been key performers season after season for their clubs.\nAwards.\nThe Most Valuable Player Award is given to player deemed the most valuable for (her team) that season. The Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award is given to player deemed the most valuable for (her team) in the finals. The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Top Shooter of the Year Award is given to the player who averages the most points at the conclusion of the regular season. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. Also named are the All-Star Five, the most valuable and best performing players of each season.\nInternational influence.\nThe WNBL has been a major stepping-stone for Australians to become noticed in European leagues and the WNBA in the United States. It has also attracted a number of players from English-speaking countries who supplement their WNBA salaries by playing in the league. This is possible because the WNBA conducts its season in the Northern Hemisphere summer, which is the off-season for most basketball leagues throughout the world, including the WNBL. A number of international players have played in the WNBL, such as:\nTelevision.\nABC held the rights from the inaugural season in 1981 until they axed their coverage in the 2014/15 season."

        "text": "The River &amp; Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, is located on a site at Mill Meadows by the River Thames. It has three main themes represented by major permanent galleries, the non-tidal River Thames, the international sport of rowing and the local town of Henley-on-Thames.\nHistory.\nThe impetus for the museum largely came from David Lunn-Rockliffe, formerly Executive Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association.\nThe building was designed by the modernist architect Sir David Chipperfield and has won awards for the building itself, including the Royal Fine Art Commission \"Building of the Year\" award in 1999. It was also UK National Heritage \"Museum of the Year\" in 1999.\nIt was officially opened in November 1998 by Queen Elizabeth II. Major benefactors include The Arbib Foundation run by local businessmen Sir Martyn Arbib and Urs Schwarzenbach. There was a 1998 opening exhibition of Julian Trevelyan 'River Thames' etchings.\nIn 2004, a \"The Wind in the Willows\" attraction for families was installed. This is a walk-through recreation using models, sets and an audio-guide of all the E.H. Shepard illustrations from the 1908 Kenneth Grahame book.\nIn 2006, the museum completed an extensive refurbishment of its Rowing Gallery, thanks to a major donation by Urs Schwarzenbach. Now known as the \"Schwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery\", it tells the story of rowing from its beginnings in ancient Greece to the modern Olympics. Thematically arranged the gallery includes sections devoted to the Oxford v. Cambridge Boat Race, World &amp; Olympic rowing, professional rowing in the 19th and early 20th centuries, boat building, coaching and nutrition. The museum now displays a unique collection of video clips. A feature in the \"Schwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery\" is an interactive exhibit \"In the Cox's Seat\" that allows visitors to sit in a rowing boat and experience a race at Henley Royal Regatta\nTemporary exhibitions have included work by the Thames-based painter Chris Gollon, the local 20th-century artist John Piper: 'The Master of Diversity in Association with Bohun Gallery and the Michael Gyselynck John Piper Collection, one of his collaborators, the potter Geoffrey Eastop, the local painter Nick Schlee, and the local furniture maker Philip Koomen. In 2006, there was an exhibition by John Piper's grandson, Luke Piper. Between November 2006 and February 2007, there was an exhibition of the illustrations of E.H. Shepard called \"The Man who Drew Pooh &amp; Toad\".\nThe museum was one of the first to have a website, which existed before the building opened.\nThemes.\nThe Museum includes four themes explored through a wide variety of exhibitions and events across four galleries and special exhibitions:\nGalleries.\nThe Wind in the Willows Gallery.\nThe permanent The Wind in the Willows exhibition includes Mr Toad, Ratty, Badger, and Mole to a location on the bank of the River Thames, whose creatures and landscapes provided the inspiration behind the original book.\nE.H. Shepard's illustrations are included as 3-D models that depict the adventures of Mr Toad, Ratty, and their friends. The Museum has rights to use the original images by Shepard, who explored the meadows and willow-fringed river around nearby Pangbourne in search of settings for these illustrations. The exhibition follows the original storyline, using theatrical lighting and sound techniques to take visitors on a journey through the world of \"The Wind in the Willows\". Interactive exhibits and specially developed audio guides help visitors feel a part of the story.\nThames Gallery.\nThe Thames Gallery is the largest of the River &amp; Rowing Museum's permanent galleries. It provides an interpretation of the River Thames from source to sea. The River Thames is a key element of life in the Thames Valley and the country as a whole. The gallery offers visitors a range of perspectives, looking at the river as an inspiration for the arts, as a natural habitat for wildlife and as both a source of pleasure and a means of trade. In a mix of music, art, photography, original objects, boats and oral testimony the gallery takes the visitor on a journey from the source at Kemble to the Thames Barrier. Exhibits from local and private collections illustrate the historic and social importance of the river, while interactive displays enable visitors to learn more about river management and water supply.\nAspects of the Thames in the exhibition include:\nSchwarzenbach International Rowing Gallery.\nThere is a contemporary painting by the entrance, \"Gollon At Henley\", painted by Chris Gollon and commissioned by the River &amp; Rowing Museum in 2008. The image shows a defeated crew at Henley Royal Regatta. Inside the gallery, the story of international rowing is presented, allowing the visitor to experience the sport and understand what it is like to compete on the water.\nRowing is one of the world's oldest sports and the gallery tells its story in detail. On display are many objects no previously shown in public, film footage showing races, and a range of interactive exhibits of general interest. Sections include exhibits on the following:\nInvesco Perpetual Henley Gallery.\nThe Invesco Perpetual Henley Gallery tells the story of the town of Henley-on-Thames, built by the river. The history presented covers industry, arts, the Civil War, sports, etc. An interactive touch-screen allows visitors to take a virtual tour around the streets of Henley, travel back through time to when the town was established, see how it has changed over time, and how it became famous for rowing.\nThe Museum acquired an Iron Age coin hoard in 2009. It is made up of 32 gold coins dating from approximately 50 AD. It was found in Henley in 2003 and is the only hoard of British-made Iron Age coins from Oxfordshire to have survived intact. They have been acquired jointly by the River &amp; Rowing Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\nHenley was established in the 12th century when its location by the river made it convenient as an inland port for shipping timber, grain, and firewood to the rapidly growing city of London. From this time onwards, the town's fortunes were linked to the river and transport. Boats, stagecoaches, railway engines and motors have in turn brought goods and people to the town for business and pleasure.\nHenley Royal Regatta has made the town of Henley-on-Thames an international centre of rowing. Established in 1839, and gaining a royal patron in 1851, the Regatta brings together leading international oarsmen and women and is considered to be part of the English social calendar. Town and Regatta celebrations since 1899 are presented on film in the gallery.\nPainted in 1698 by the Dutch master Jan Siberechts (1627–c.1703), \"Henley from the Wargrave Road\" has its own room off the Henley Gallery. A masterpiece displaying the multifaceted life of the town and surrounding countryside, it is one of a series of English landscapes by Siberechts, The painting is a record of social history, showing the river trade, agriculture, and social hierarchy, alongside a still familiar view of the town. \"Henley from the Wargrave Road\" was purchased with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nSpecial exhibitions.\nTreasures Gallery, Sir Graham Kirkham Gallery, and The Wall provide venues for special exhibitions throughout the year. The Museum's exhibition programme is designed around its major themes and includes exhibitions that have a family appeal as well as more specialist exhibitions. Topics range from celebrations of major events and anniversaries to arts, crafts, and sculpture or in-depth investigations."

        "title": "Japanese High School Baseball Championship",
        "text": "The of Japan, commonly known as , is an annual nationwide high school baseball tournament. It is the largest scale amateur sport event in Japan.\nThe tournament, organized by the Japan High School Baseball Federation and \"Asahi Shimbun\", takes place during the summer school vacation period, culminating in a two-week final tournament stage with 49 teams in August at in the Koshien district of Nishinomiya City, Hyōgo, Japan.\nBackground.\nIn the past teams from overseas have participated in the tournament. Korea fielded teams from 1921 to 1940; both Taiwan and Manchuria had teams participate from 1923 to 1940.\nThe 49 schools taking part in the final tourney represent regional champions of each of the prefectures of Japan (with two from Hokkaidō and Tokyo). From mid-June until July, regional tournaments are held to decide who is sent to Koshien.\nThe rules are the same as in the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament. It is a single elimination tournament with nine inning games. Games are declared official after seven complete innings in the case of suspension (due to weather, et cetera), except for the championship game which must be played to completion. For the regional tournaments, games are ended if one team leads by at least ten runs after five innings or seven runs after seven innings, except in the championship games. Designated hitters are not used. Four umpires are used, except for night games in which two outfield line umpires are added.\nThe first round pairings and byes are decided by lottery. 34 teams meet in the first round, and 15 teams with byes join at the second round (32 teams play in the second round). Therefore, it takes either five or six wins for a team to win the championship. Until 2002, the four quarter finals were played in one day, but this was changed to two a day over two days to give the players time off. If rainouts continue for more than three days, four games are played in one day. This occurred in 2003, so the first time the quarter finals were played over two days was actually 2004. To accommodate the extra day, the long tradition of starting the tournament on August 8 was changed to start a day or two early.\nUp to four games are played each day until the quarter finals. The starting times of each day's games is shown below. Following games are begun about 30 minutes after the previous game ends. Due to the fast pace of the pitching, four games in one day are usually completed before sunset.\nExtra innings.\nFor tournaments previous to 1958 there were no extra inning limits for a game tied after nine innings of play. In 1933, Masao Yoshida had pitched a complete game during a 25 inning shutout in the semifinal, an all-time record. Yoshida had thrown 336 pitches during that game.\nIn 1958, games were limited to 18 innings, with a full replay required after that on a future day. The first pitcher to pitch a complete game 18 innings was Eiji Bando in a 1958 quarterfinal game. Daisuke Matsuzaka became the last pitcher to pitch a complete game over 15 innings (17 innings in 250 pitches, 1998).\nFrom 2000 to 2017, games were capped at 15 innings with a full replay required on a future day. In 2006, the replay rule was implemented after a 15 inning tie in the final.\nIn 2018, the Japan High School Baseball Federation capped regular play to 12 innings (except in the championship final), but games will continue with the World Baseball Softball Confederation baseball tiebreaker with runners on first and second base (the previous two players relative to the current player in the batting order) starting with in the 13th inning.\nTraditions.\nThe tournament theme song is .\nUsually air sirens are used to signal the start and the end of the games, the earlier registers of this tradition are from 1936. Its origins are unknown, but considering the time of its origin, before the advent of mass communication, it is considered that its use was the same as it is nowadays; to signal the start and the finish of a match for spectators and stadium workforce.\nEvery five years, the tournament celebrates the anniversary of the founding of the tournament, and a deep crimson is used for the championship flag for commemorative purposes. Also, on those editions, the number of participants on the final part of the tournament also grows.\nFor third year students, a loss at the tournament signifies an end to their high school baseball career, as there are no other major tournaments for the rest of their academic career. It is common for players to cry in sorrow after tight games and/or their losses.\nAnother common tradition after games is the act of collect the soil from the Koshien Stadium infield as a souvenir. The dirt collected by the chosen players is shared among the baseball club members of the schools. The dirt is kept as memoriblia for the third year players and shared between first and second years as a way to motivate them to reach the Koshien spot once again, but sometimes, first and second years refuse to receive the soil as a way to motivate them to return to Koshien.\nSome teams also decide take part of the soil and throw the soil into the infield of their training practice as a way to bring good luck for them into the next year's tournament.\nAn interesting exception to this tradition happened in 1958. At the time, Okinawa was under U.S. rule. In that year, Okinawa's Shuri baseball team participated for the first time in both spring and summer. After losing to Tsuruga (from Fukui) in the first round of the summer tournament, they decided to pick up the infield soil after the game. However, they were not allowed to bring the dirt back to Okinawa, having to discard it at the port as the soil was considered \"foreign soil\". Volunteer flight attendants from Japan Airlines learned of the story and decided picked up stones from the coast of Nishinomiya and donated them to Shuri. The stones are still displayed in the school yard as a monument called , celebrating the team's first appearance at the Koshien.\nIn popular culture.\nSome of the most famous appearances of the Japanese High School Baseball Championship in popular culture are in the manga and anime series \"Touch\", \"H2\" and \"Cross Game\" by Mitsuru Adachi, \"Ace of Diamond\" by Yūji Terajima, and \"Major\" by Takuya Mitsuda. Those series follow the struggles of different high school teams' bids to make it to the Kōshien tournament.\nThe 2014 hit Taiwanese film \"Kano\" is based on the true story of a high school baseball team from the Kagi Nōrin (Agriculture) High School (now known as National Chiayi University) team in Kagi (now known as Chiayi), Taiwan who qualified for the tournament for the first time in 1931 after never having won a game in its first three seasons. The team was made up of ethnic Japanese, Han Chinese and Taiwanese aborigines. The team won three games to make it to the championship game before losing 4–0 to Chukyō Shōgyō from Nagoya. This was the first of four appearances at the tournament for the Kano team, who later qualified in 1933, 1935 and 1936.\nIn 2023, TBS made a live action drama based in the book \"Gekokujō Kyūshi\", The book tells about the jorney of Hakusan High school, a small Mie school that managed to pull a historic upset win in the 2018 Prefectural tournament, taking the school for the first time ever into Summer Koshien. \nThe Summer Koshien Tournament has a longstanding tradition of launching the careers of many famous players, many of whom get drafted to the NPB and eventually make their way to the MLB. Names include 2001 AL Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player Ichiro Suzuki, 2006 World Baseball Classic MVP and 2007 World Series Champion Daisuke Matsuzaka, as well Yu Darvish, a five-time MLB All-Star, and Shohei Ohtani, who won the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year, 2021 and 2023 AL Most Valuable Player."

While finishing in the top teams generally guarantees an invitation, it is up to the Japan High School Baseball Federation to determine invitees. For instance, in the 2008 Fall Tournament in the Tōhoku region, Ichinoseki Gakuin was the runner-up. However, they were passed over for 3rd place Hanamaki Higashi for the 2009 invitation tournament.\nOf the 32 bids, 26 are automatically awarded as follows to the following regions:\nIn addition, one additional bid is awarded to a team in the Kanto/Tokyo region, and another to a team in the Chugoku/Shikoku region.\nThe region of the winning team in the Meiji Jingu Fall Tournament (which consists of all fall regional champions) also receives a bid.\nThe final 3 bids are what are considered \"21st Century Teams\".\n21st century teams are a way to give teams who either may not get close to qualifying or who have served as a model school in some way a chance to compete. A team from each prefecture is nominated around November–December. The teams must have advanced to the round of 16 play, but not gotten past the quarterfinals of their prefecture's tournament. Then each region nominates one of those nominees to the selection committee by December 15. Finally, the committee selects the three 21st century teams."

In a shock result, the Australia A team (captained by Damien Martyn and featuring up-and-comers such as Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden and Greg Blewett, as well as veterans – wicket-keeper Phil Emery and pacemen Paul Reiffel and Merv Hughes) ousted England from the series and went into the best-of-3 final against Australia.

Many of the 1994–95 A players later played for Australia.\nIn earlier times, Australia often sent Second XI teams on overseas tour, consisting of players on the fringes of national selection. Instances of this occurred in 1949–50 and 1959–60, to New Zealand.\nIn one-day cricket, Australia A's team colours were the same as Australia's, except reversed with dark green instead of bottle green and canary yellow instead of wattle gold.\nCurrent squad.\nAustralia A squad for Australian tour of Sri Lanka 2022\nCoaching staff.\nThe following coaching panel was named ahead of Australia A's tour to New Zealand in April 2023."

        "title": "US Open Series",
        "text": "The US Open Series is the name given by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to a series of North American professional tennis tournaments leading up to and including the US Open. It is part of the \"North American hard court season\". Emirates sponsored the series in the past, under a deal in place from 2012 to 2016. The series was initially organized in 2004 as a way to focus more attention on American tennis tournaments by getting more of them on domestic television. Until 2004, most summer North American tournaments were not on television, the exceptions being the prominent ATP Tour Masters 1000 events in Canada and Cincinnati. Since the inception of the series, Rafael Nadal is the only tennis player to win Canada, Cincinnati, and the US Open in a calendar year (2013), a feat referred to as the \"Summer Slam\" or the \"North American Hardcourt Slam\".\nUnder the US Open's broadcast rights, ESPN held domestic rights to all US Open Series events from 2015 to 2019. The eight non-Masters tournaments receive about 50 hours of television combined – about two hours on each day of their final weekends, chiefly on ESPN2. The dual-gender Washington D.C. Citi Open (the only ATP 500-level tournament in North America), which had been a part of the series since its 2004 founding, withdrew from the series for its 2015 edition due to frustrations over this lack of coverage; that tournament sold its exclusive coverage to Tennis Channel. The tournament re-joined the US Open Series in 2019. Since 2017, Tennis Channel broadcasts the US Open Series.\nBonus Challenge.\nPlayers earn points for the US Open Series Bonus Challenge in order to win a bonus on top of the individual series tournaments' prize money, according to their results in these events. More points are awarded at some of the events, such as the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and WTA Premier 5 events. The three male and three female players with the most points in the US Open Series Bonus Challenge earn a money purse. The amount depends on their US Open Series placement and US Open result. If both are won then the bonus is $1 million as of 2010. Lleyton Hewitt and Lindsay Davenport were the top point-getters in 2004, Andy Roddick and Kim Clijsters won in 2005, and Andy Roddick and Ana Ivanovic won in 2006. Defending US Open champions Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova won in 2007. In 2005, whereas Roddick was upset in the first round against Gilles Müller at the Open, Clijsters became the first player to win both the US Open Series and the US Open, receiving $2.2 million, at the time the largest payday in women's sports. Clijsters defeated Frenchwoman Mary Pierce in straight sets: 6–3, 6–1. In 2010 she won $2.2 million again, this time $1.7 million for the US Open title and $500,000 in bonus for second place in the US Open Series. In 2007, Federer became the first male player and the second player overall to win the US Open Series and go on to win the US Open, winning $1.4 million plus the US Open Series bonus of $1 million, bringing his prize winning total to $2.4 million. This topped Clijsters' $2.2 million as the biggest US Open payday to date. In 2013, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal both won the US Open after also winning the US Open Series. Due to several considerable prize money increments over the years, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal surpassed Roger Federer's Us Open series payday record by winning $3.6 million each, and they shared the record for the largest prize money paycheck in tennis history for a single tennis tournament. In 2014, Serena Williams would repeat her previous year performance in winning both the US Open Series and the US Open. She now stands alone in the record for the biggest payday in tennis history, with a total amount of $4 million. Starting from 2017, the US Open Series will not feature a Bonus Challenge.\nSeries tournaments.\nTournaments.\nIn 2023, the US Open Series comprises the following tournaments:\nSeries standings + performance at the US Open.\nNote: From 2006 on, only players who earned points in at least two US Open Series events are eligible for the final (Top 3) standings."

A proposed tour of Australia late in 1971-72 was in doubt, and was later called off, and the prospects of future international cricket looked unlikely.\nIn the event, a tour by the New Zealand women's cricket team in 1971-72 proved to be the last official international cricket that South Africa would play until the apartheid laws were repealed."

        "text": "The Indianapolis Tennis Center, originally known as the Indianapolis Sports Center, was a tennis stadium complex with additional outdoor and indoor tennis courts on the campus of Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in Indianapolis, Indiana. The stadium, which seated 10,000 spectators, was built in 1979. At that time it was the venue for the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships tournament. It was also the site of the tennis events for the 1987 Pan American Games.\nWhen originally constructed, the complex included 14 outdoor courts, all of which, including the stadium court, had a clay surface. In 1989 an indoor facility featuring six DecoTurf Ii courts was added, and the stadium court and other outdoor courts were converted from clay to DecoTurf. Due to the change in playing surface, the name of the tournament was changed to the RCA Tennis Championships. The name of the tournament changed again to the Indianapolis Tennis Championships in 2007 due to the loss of the RCA sponsorship.\nChanges to the date of the tournament to a less desirable point in the ATP tour combined with the loss of sponsorship resulted in the tournament being sold and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Maintenance costs due to the loss of tournament income plus IUPUI's need for the land for future development led to the closure of the facility in August 2010 and its subsequent demolition that year.\nHistory.\nThe City of Indianapolis and IU Trustees proposed a multi-use recreational center be built as the site of the National Clay Court Tournament. The proposed project would be constructed in two phases: Phase I, estimated to cost $6 million, would include a permanent 8,000-seat, air stadium and 17 adjacent courts Phase II calls for a clubhouse that would include dining facilities, racquetball courts, and locker room. The IU School of Physical Education, now known as the School of Health and Human Sciences, taught tennis classes at the complex up until its demolition in 2010.\nThe Indianapolis Tennis Center was built in 1979 and designed by Browning, Day, Mullins, Dierdorf, Inc. Originally known as the Indianapolis Sports Center, the stadium possessed 10,000 seats. Following its completion in 1979, the Tennis Indianapolis Tennis Center hosted the National Clay Court Tournament, which would later change its name to the RCA Tennis Championships and then the Indianapolis Tennis Championships. The original complex included 14 outdoor courts with a clay surface. The complex had an air-conditioned box for reporters, a Champions room below the south stands, two electronic scoreboards, and multiple locker rooms.\nThe Tennis Center was the site of tennis events during the 1987 Pan American Games. In 1989, an indoor facility consisting of six DecoTurf style courts was added and the original courts were converted from clay to DecoTurf. In June 1988, Justice Inc. hosted a Pride event at the Indiana Tennis Center which marked one the first LGBTQ events that took place in a public space in Indianapolis. IUPUI assumed management of the Indianapolis Sports Center in 1992 under an agreement with Municipal Recreation Inc. In 2007, the Indianapolis Tennis Center lost the RCA sponsorship, prompting the tournament to change its name to the Indianapolis Tennis Championships. The Tennis Center was closed in August 2010 and demolished the following year.6"

        "text": "The Indian Wells Tennis Garden is a tennis facility in Indian Wells, near Palm Springs, California, in the Coachella Valley. The 16,100-capacity Stadium 1 is the largest stadium at the tennis complex, and the second largest outdoor tennis stadium in the world (after the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open).\nIt is the home of the BNP Paribas Open (previously the Pacific Life Open), a joint event of both the men's ATP World Tour and the women's WTA Tour, and constitutes the fifth largest tournament in the world, held each year in March. The Indian Wells Tennis Garden also hosts junior and adult United States Tennis Association events year-round. In addition to these large events, during the week members can use the courts for recreational play, and the Tennis Garden sets up matches for individuals who want to play. Additionally, the venue offers clinics, and there are professionals on staff available for a fee.\nHistory.\nThe $77 million facility was built in March 2000, and was designed by Rossetti Associates Architects. It was a result of former no. 1 US player, tournament chairman and owner of the BNP Paribas Open, Charlie Pasarell, partnering with Raymond Moore, to privately raise the money to fund the $77 million development. It was financed by IMG, led by Bob Kain. When Pasarell and his partners first purchased 88 acres of sand in the middle of the Coachella Valley, many doubted its ability to attract people, as all other major tournaments are located in large metropolitan areas, such as Paris, London, New York City, and Melbourne. However, subsequent owners have shared and built on Pasarell's vision for the center.\nIn 2006, the Indian Wells Tennis Garden was bought by a group of private investors including Tennis Magazine owners George Mackin and Bob Miller, Pete Sampras, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, Greg Norman, Charlie Pasarell, and Raymond Moore. In December 2009, Larry Ellison, co-founder and CEO of Oracle Corporation, became the owner of both the Indian Wells Tennis Garden and the BNP Paribas Open. A long-term tennis enthusiast, Ellison continually invests in upgrading the facility, including a new, permanent Stadium 2 with 8,000 seats, two 19,000-square-foot shade structures, 29 world-class courts, 23 lighted courts, upgraded locker rooms and fitness areas, a 108-seat press room and 18 broadcast booths, eight acres of outdoor exposition space and 54 acres of outdoor parking.\nIn total, the Tennis Garden contains 29 tennis courts, including a 16,100-seat Stadium 1, 9 match courts and 6 practice courts. Stadium 1 is the second largest tennis-specific stadium in the world.\nAs well as tennis, the venue has hosted concerts by artists such as The Eagles, The Who, Tom Petty, Andrea Bocelli, and RBD. The NBA has played three pre-season exhibition games at Indian Wells, with all these events involving the Phoenix Suns. The first game featured the Suns against the Denver Nuggets on October 11, 2008; the NBA's first outdoor game since September 1972. On October 10, 2009, the Suns played the Golden State Warriors and on October 9, 2010, the game featured the Suns and the Dallas Mavericks.\n&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;"

It features a 13,800-seat venue named Stadium Court as its centerpiece, and was home of the Miami Open from 1987 until 2018. The Miami Open used twelve courts for competition courts, plus six practice courts. The facility is also home to two European red clay courts, four American green clay courts, and two grass courts. During the majority of the year when the Miami Open is not on site, the Tennis Center is a Miami-Dade County park that is open to the public year-round. All aforementioned playing surfaces, including the stadium court, are available for public use. There are 27 courts in total, including 13 that are lighted.\nThe Tennis Center at Crandon Park was the third home of the Miami Open. It began in Delray Beach in 1985 and moved to Boca Raton in 1986, before settling in Key Biscayne in 1987. The Miami Open then moved to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens starting in 2019. The Tennis Center is also home to the United States Tennis Association's player development program headquarters and from 1999 to 2010 the 16-and-under Junior Orange Bowl.\nDuring the 2013 Miami Masters, plans were unveiled to fully renovate Crandon Park Tennis Center which would include building three permanent show courts. Legal issues regarding restrictions on the Park's usage prevented the plan's implementation. The subsequent move of the Miami Open to Hard Rock Stadium presumably ended any efforts to redevelop the site."

        "text": "The Cullman–Heyman Tennis Center is an 8-court indoor intercollegiate tennis facility and outdoor stadium located on the campus of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The Cullman–Heyman Tennis Center is part of the Yale University tennis complex which consists of 17 outdoor and 8 indoor DecoTurf hardcourts. Across Yale Avenue from the Yale Tennis Complex is the Connecticut Tennis Center Stadium, which hosted men's and women's professional tennis tournaments, hosted its last WTA tournament in 2018. In 2019 approval was given to convert the stadium into a concert venue. The outdoor stadium was built in 1991 for the Volvo Tennis Championships, and by 2009 it had seats for 15,000 spectators. The current capacity of the Connecticut Tennis Center Stadium is around 15,000, making it the third largest tennis venue in the United States and one of the largest in the world by capacity, behind the French Open's Roland Garros Stadium. The Cullman–Heyman Tennis Center is located at 279 Derby Avenue, West Haven, CT 06516. The facility has a master scoreboard and there are HD video cameras on every court that support streaming. All eight courts also have individual scoreboards.\nThe facility has hosted major intercollegiate national championships like the ITA Indoor Collegiate Individual Championships in 2009 and the ITA Women's Team Championships in February 2017. CHTC also hosts the ECAC Championships and the ITA Regional Individual Championships every year.\nConstruction.\nWhen the USTA/Volvo Tennis announced in 1989 that the Volvo Tennis Tournament was going be held annually at Yale University and City of New Haven (site of a US Open qualifier tournament for ATP and WTA players), the organizers chose Architects Edward Larrabee Barnes and John My Lee Architects to build the permanent facility in 1991 due to Barnes' previous Yale projects. The entire design and construction process took only 11 months from start to finish, most of the structure was made of prefab concrete components made on site and pieced together. This was done by Blakeslee Prestress Inc.\nLead architect, Lee, an avid tennis player and fan, said the open sides, \"Reduced the fishbowl effect and made the construction access much easier.\""

        "title": "Rugby league in Australia",
        "text": "Rugby league in Australia has been one of Australia's most popular sports since it started being played there in 1908. It is the dominant winter football code in the states of New South Wales and Queensland. In 2022, it was the most watched sport on Australian television with an aggregate audience of 137.3 million viewers. The premier club competition is the National Rugby League (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, four teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The premier representative competition is the annual Rugby league State of Origin featuring two sides, the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons is often referred to as \"Australian sport's greatest rivalry\", it is one of Australia's premier sporting events, attracting huge interest and television audiences. \nAustralia has a rich history of rugby league, first taking up the sport in 1908 alongside people in Britain and New Zealand. The country has been dominant over the other rugby league-playing nations for many years, but enjoys a strong rivalry with New Zealand.\nCommonly known as \"league\" or \"football\", and sometimes referred to as \"the greatest game of all\", it is traditionally seen as a \"working man's sport\" with its roots in the working class communities of Northern England, compared to rugby union which has its roots in prestigious English public schools. The governing body in Australia is the Australian Rugby League Commission.\nHistory.\n20th Century.\nBy the time England's new \"Northern Union game\" arrived in Australia it was fundamentally different from that of the Southern Rugby Union, with lineouts, rucks and two players from each team having already been removed, and the play-the-ball introduced to improve the game's flow.\nA similar schism to that which occurred in England, and for similar reasons, opened up in the rugby union establishment of Australia, seeing the term \"rugby league\" first used for the new game as in the rest of the world, in 1907 at the instigation of the famous test cricketer Victor Trumper. At a meeting in Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney, New South Wales, the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) was formed as a professional organisation. Players were immediately recruited for the new game, and despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the rugby union, the NSWRFL managed to recruit Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger, the most famous rugby footballer in Sydney at that time. The visit by James Giltinan, Harry Hoyle, and Victor Trumper on Sunday 11 August 1907 to gain the agreement of Dally Messenger's mother, Annie Messenger, for him to switch to the new code is part of Rugby League folklore.\nRugby league then went on to displace rugby union as the primary football code in New South Wales. Four matches were played in Sydney on the New South Wales Rugby Football League's \"Foundation Day\" on 20 April 1908 (Easter Monday) in two double headers. At Wentworth Park in Sydney's Glebe, Easts beat Newtown before Glebe triumphed over Newcastle while at Birchgrove Oval in Balmain, South Sydney beat North Sydney and Balmain beat Wests. On 8 May 1909 the first match of rugby league was played in Brisbane. Past Grammars played against Souths before a handful of spectators at the Gabba.\nThe Newcastle Rugby League was founded in 1910 with four clubs, Central Newcastle, Northern Suburbs, South Newcastle and Western Suburbs. The Illawarra Rugby League was founded in 1911 with five clubs (Dapto, Helensburgh, Mount Keira, Unanderra and Wollongong). In 1911, a Goldfields' League was formed in West Wyalong, and games were played in Tamworth, Aberdeen, and along the South Coast. The game was introduced to Orange in 1912 and spread quickly through the western districts. In 1913 branch leagues were formed at Bathurst, Dubbo, Nowra, and Tamworth. In 1914 and 1915 an amalgamation of rugby league and Australian rules football was considered and trialled.\nThe 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw a record attendance for any sport at the Sydney Cricket Ground as Australia won the Ashes for the first time on home soil. In 1921 approximately 30,000 people watched a women's rugby league game in Sydney. This set a long-standing record for the highest attendance at a women's sporting competition outside the Olympic or Commonwealth games.\nThe attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe 50th anniversary of rugby league in Australia was marked by hosting the second ever Rugby League World Cup tournament in 1957.\nThe attendance record for a rugby league match was re-set by the 1965 NSWRFL season's Grand Final between St. George and South Sydney attracting a crowd of 78,065. The 1967 NSWRFL season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.\nArthur Beetson became the first indigenous Australian to captain the national team of any sport when in 1973 he was selected to lead the Kangaroos. Also that year NSWRFL boss Kevin Humphreys negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1976 Eastern Suburbs became the first rugby league team, and one of the first in Australian sport, to sport a sponsor's name on their jersey.\nThe NSWRFL Premiership spread outside Sydney in 1982 with the introduction of the Illawarra Steelers and Canberra Raiders. In 1986, Brisbane Rugby League player Bob Lindner was the last to be selected from a non-NSWRL club to debut for the Australian national team. 1987 was the last year that a state of Origin player was selected from a non-NSWRL club. In 1988 the NSWRL's first teams from outside the borders of New South Wales were added: the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants.\nIn 1993 the Australian Women's Rugby League was formed. The 1993 Winfield Cup Grand Final drew remarkably strong ratings nationwide. The second game of the 1994 State of Origin series was brought south to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and re-set the nation's rugby league attendance record with 87,161. This success had set the scene for a truly national competition which eventuated in 1995 with the addition of teams from Townsville, Perth and even Auckland in New Zealand. However the growth of the competition was severely hampered by one of the biggest corporate disputes in Australian history over control of it: the Super League war. The Super League war was fought in and out of court during the mid-1990s by the News Ltd-backed Super League and Kerry Packer-backed Australian Rugby League organisations over control of the top-level professional rugby league football competition of Australasia. In 1995, New South Wales State of Origin and Kangaroos Test forward Ian Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay. 1997 was unique in Australian rugby league's history as it was split into two separate competitions: the 1997 ARL season and the 1997 Super League season. The following season the premiership was re-united under the National Rugby League partnership committee, composed of representatives from Australian Rugby League and News Ltd.\n21st Century.\nIn 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia was celebrated, with 2008 World Cup being held and the Royal Australian Mint launching a series of uncirculated coins in November 2007 to commemorate the occasion.\nThe percentage of indigenous players in top-level rugby league premiership was reported to have fallen from 21% in the 1990s to 11% in 2009.\nIn 2009, rugby league's popularity in Australia was confirmed as it had the highest television ratings of any sport. This occurred again in 2010, with an increased number of people watching Rugby League (120 million) compared to AFL (112 million). This is a season when an unprecedented scandal took place: the Melbourne Storm was found to have conducted four systematic breaches of the competition's salary cap, and had all honours gained over the previous years (including 2 premierships) nullified, were forced to pay large fines and shed enough star players to get back under the cap, all while playing the rest of the season already guaranteed the wooden spoon.\n2012 saw a major re-structure of the administration of rugby league in Australia. The newly formed independent Australian Rugby League Commission took over control of the National Rugby League premiership, the State of Origin series and the Australian national team.\nA 2013 report found that behind cricket, rugby league was Australia's second-most popular sport. The same year a report conducted by Brand Finance valued the Penrith Panthers club at $46.2m, the highest of any Australian sporting brand, while the Brisbane Broncos had the highest brand equity.\nPolling conducted by Roy Morgan Research indicated that in 2014 the NRL was second only to the AFL in terms of football television viewship. In 2018, the NRL superseded the AFL's television viewership by over five million viewers.\nGoverning body.\nFederal governing body.\nThe Australian Rugby League Commission is the governing body for the sport of rugby league in Australia and also conducts all representative rugby league, including the national team and the annual State of Origin series. The Australian Rugby League's major club competition is the National Rugby League.\nState based governing bodies.\nAt state level, the game is administered by local governing bodies under the control of the ARLC. The state bodies include the New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League, as well as Northern Territory Rugby League, South Australian Rugby League, Tasmanian Rugby League, Victorian Rugby League and Western Australia Rugby League which have Affiliate state status.\nNew South Wales has a second governing body, the New South Wales Country Rugby League (NSWCRL) to govern the sport outside the Sydney metropolitan area. In spite of its name, NSWCRL also governs rugby league in the Australian Capital Territory. However, the NSWRL absorbed the CRL in 2019.\nClub competitions.\nThe elite professional rugby league club competition in Australia is the National Rugby League (NRL). The NRL's Telstra Premiership is contested by 4 teams from Queensland, 10 from New South Wales, 1 from Victoria and 1 from the Australian Capital Territory as well as 1 team from New Zealand. Formerly, 16 of these teams also fielded National Youth Competition teams, an Under 20s competition that ceased in 2017. This was replaced by the Jersey Flegg Cup and the Hastings Deering Colts, locally-administrated state-based competitions for New South Wales and Queensland respectively.\nUnderneath the NRL, semi-professional competitions such as the Hostplus Cup, Knock-On Effect NSW Cup and Ron Massey Cup are run in both New South Wales and Queensland. These competitions are the major feeder competitions for the NRL competition. Alongside these mainly metropolitan-based competitions country rugby league bodies run competitions throughout rural Queensland and New South Wales. Amateur competitions are run in the Affiliated states.\nAttendances.\nRugby league attendances saw their previously best year in 1995 (the year before Australia's Super League War, with total attendances reaching 3,061,893. Six clubs averaged over 20,000 in that year, a feat still unmatched. This was a large increase on the previous years and was no doubt due to the formation of several new clubs and the renaming of the competition, from the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) to the Australian Rugby league (ARL).\nThe year of 1996 was a turbulent one for Australian rugby league and saw what may be the largest decrease in attendance ever (2,450,776, down 611,117 down from 1995) in the ARL. This crowd decrease is attributed to the poor publicity surrounding the ongoing court cases related to the Super League War. When the Super League competition was introduced in 1997 and played alongside the ARL competition it attracted 1,111,189. The ARL for the same year saw slightly higher attendances of 1,308,824. Subsequent years of 1998, in which the merger of the SL and ARL formed the National Rugby League (NRL) and 1999 also saw increases.\nThe year 2000 saw club mergers and \"relegations\" from the NRL. The effective slashing of clubs from the first grade rugby league competition was reflected in the slashing of crowd figures as fans became disgruntled by the club they had supported for many years being torn apart.\nCrowd figures did not improve until 2003, with an increase of 249,317 on the previous year, 2002. Figures increased again in 2004 and 2005. The aggregate crowd for 2005 was 2,964,288 and the average crowd figure for regular season matches was 16,468, the highest ever recorded, and 34,710 for play-offs. In 2006, attendance slightly dipped to 2,808,235. An average of 15,601 for regular season matches and 34,163 for playoffs, which was still an improvement on 2004 figures.\nIn 2007, the number of teams competing in first grade rugby league in Australia increased for the first time since 2002 with the re-introduction of the Gold Coast Titans in Gold Coast, Queensland.(Statistics do not include finals)\nIn 2010 Rugby League recorded its best year ever in Australia, setting a new all-time total season attendance record of 3,490,778 spectators — and with four less teams than in 1995.\nRepresentative competitions.\nThe State of Origin series is an annual best-of-three series of interstate matches between the two strongest rugby league states Queensland and New South Wales. The State of Origin series is one of Australia's premier sporting events, attracting a huge television audience and usually selling out the stadiums in which the games are played. From 2012–2021, an Under 20s State of Origin match was held annually on the same weekend as the Australia vs New Zealand test. This has now been changed to Under 19s.\nWomen's State of Origin has been held since 1999, and in 2021 an Under 19s Women's series was introduced.\nCity vs Country Origin is an annual Australian rugby league match that takes place in New South Wales between teams made up of NRL players representing 'City' (Sydney metropolitan area) and 'Country' (all areas in NSW outside the Sydney metropolitan area).\nThe Affiliated States Championship is an annual competition involving four affiliated states (Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia) plus representative sides from the Australian Police and Australian Defence Force.\nDemographics of the game.\nTotal participation.\nIn an interview for a Sydney Morning Herald article in 2021, Chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission, Peter V'landys, revealed yearly rugby league participation figures from 2015 to 2021. These participation figures show that national participation in 2019 (the last year before COVID-19 disruption) for males was 147,723 of whom 83,400 were located in New South Wales. National participation figures in 2019 for females was 14,958 with 7,108 were located in New South Wales. By the time of the article in 2021, national participation figures for males had declined to 143,792 whilst national participation for females had increased to 16,899.\nIn 2021, a total of 30,648 students in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia from 354 schools participated in rugby league. The NRL 2008 Annual report included significantly higher school participation figures suggesting either a substantial decline of 89% or a more generous definition was applied when measuring participants historically.\nWomen in rugby league.\nThe vast majority of rugby league participants are male. Of the 172,000 participants in 2004, 5% were female.\nNational participation figures released in 2021 show female participants number 16,899 accounting for 10.52% of the total national participation number of 160,691.\nThe Australian Women's Rugby League was formed in 1993, which only achieved affiliation with the Australian Rugby League in 1998. This is in contrast to the men's competition which has existed since 1908.\nThe lack of female-participation in Australian rugby league can mostly be attributed to the predominantly masculine culture which discourages women from playing, and provides little financial or cultural incentive to play.\nDespite this, a women's rugby league match in Sydney in 1921 attracted around 30,000 spectators.\nFemales account for a large percentage of rugby league's viewing public and the attraction of the game for women partly accounts for rugby league's very strong position in the Australian sporting landscape. Many NRL clubs hold initiatives to foster this relationship. For instance, in 2005 the Canterbury Bulldogs staged a luncheon for 300 of Sydney's corporate women to raise funds for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, as well as skills development for school girls within the Canterbury-Bankstown district. This follows the increased number of female members to the boards of the National Rugby League and several of its clubs. Manly Sea Eagles also instituted several female directed initiatives, some of which were aimed towards further increasing female spectator numbers.\nNot all the perceptions of rugby league being a mostly man game are completely true. At a junior and local level there are many women involved in volunteering positions. Women form a very important part of the local club structures. However, it is not customary for women over the age of 11 to continue playing rugby league against the boys and the exclusively women's rugby league clubs have a relatively small profile in comparison to the local boys' clubs.\nRugby league became the first mainstream professional sport in Australia to appoint a female director to a governing body, with Katie Page, the managing director of retail giant Harvey Norman, accepting an invitation to join the National Rugby League's executive board.\nIn 2009 the Australian National Women's rugby league side (Jillaroos) defeated the 2008 Women's Rugby League World Champions New Zealand, in Auckland, ending a ten-year streak of successive defeats at the hands of the New Zealand team.\nAge.\nJunior participation.\nAn analysis of 2001 New South Wales Child Health Survey by the University of New South Wales has shown that 23.2% of parents are likely to discourage their son from playing rugby league. In contrast, the next most discouraged sport was rugby union, with only 7.5% of parents willing to discourage the sport. This is despite recent research by Medibank annually since 2003 that puts other sports in Australia, such as Australian Rules Football and soccer as producing more major injuries.\nThe injury rates and the public perception of rugby league as a dangerous sport are most likely the catalysts for the introduction of several initiatives by the national rugby league and ARL development in recent years to curb the number of youth playing other sports. The specific initiatives over the years includes a Safe play code, Kids to kangaroos programmes and new forms of modified rugby league, such as, Mod league and Mini Footy to help young children prepare for the full rigours of the international code. Also with such introductions are the competitions aimed at school children such as Joey league, League of legends and League Sevens, which use modified rugby league rules such as Tag and Sevens.\nWhilst previous announcements in annual reports have claimed junior registrations as high as 120,667 and up to 1,000,000 children engaged in \"rugby-league based physical activities in 2008\" (which would equate to roughly 1/3 of all primary and secondary children nationwide in that year), more recent reports have identified far lower participation numbers of 160,691 total registrations and 30,648 students nationwide.\nSenior participation.\nIn 2008, 51,540 people participated in senior rugby league. Participation numbers amongst senior divisions tend to decline in higher age groups. While this can be expected to the nature of a physical sport, overall rugby league senior numbers have declined since the early 1990s. The ARL attributes this to game becoming more physically demanding and the increasing pressure to sustain semi-professional clubs and teams. At the same time, however, it notes that \"rugby league is, generally, missing a recreational game that keeps people playing the sport when they drop out of the so-called elite stream\". To combat this, the ARL is investing programs, modified rules and gala days to increase senior participation such as the ARL Masters Carnival.\nLocation.\nRugby league is by far the largest and most popular sport in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (which constitute 55% of the population of Australia). In these states, NRL viewership figures far outweigh those of any other sport, and crowd figures are ahead of those of Cricket and the AFL, the next largest sports in terms of attendance. \nNew South Wales and Queensland account for the majority of rugby league participation numbers. However, per capita figures show that Queensland and the Northern Territory rate ahead of New South Wales participation figures, making Queensland and the Northern Territory the largest participators per capita of rugby league in Australia. \nRugby league enjoys lower participation in other states of Australia due to competition with Australia's other premier football code Australian rules football, and the high junior level participation rates of other sports such as soccer and basketball. Victoria and Western Australia have roughly an equal number of participants with Western Australia higher per capita. The establishment of the Melbourne Storm has seen Victoria experience growth in player counts, especially in school based rugby league participation which registered 9,023 participants in 2022. South Australia has the lowest participation levels for mainland Australia and Tasmania has, by far, the least participants for rugby league in the entire nation.\nVariants.\nThree main variant sports of rugby league are played in Australia; Touch, OzTag, and League tag. As can be seen above, total rugby league participation including Variants is well over 1.5 million (1 million touch alone).\nTouch.\nTouch (also known as touch football or touch rugby) is a variant of rugby league that is conducted under the direction of the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Though it shares similarities and history with rugby league, it is recognised as a sport in its own right due to its differences which have been developed over the sport's lifetime.\nTouch is a variation of rugby league with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch is therefore considered a limited-contact sport. The original basic rules of touch were established in the 1960s by members of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Sydney, Australia.\nThe sport is governed in Australia by Touch Football Australia in partnership with the NRL, and is played by over 1 million people nationwide. Top level competitions include the NRL Touch Premiership and the National Touch League.\nOzTag.\nOzTag is a non-contact form of rugby league, and can be seen as a variation of British tag rugby. Cronulla Sharks and St George Dragons halfback Perry Haddock introduced the sport in Australia while coaching the 1992 St George Jersey Flegg side. Together with Chris Parkes, the two took the sport to fields across Australia. Today, it is played by over 200,000 players in organised leagues across the country.\nLeague Tag.\nLeague Tag replaces tackling with the removal of one of two tags carried on an opponent's hips, attached directly to specific League Tag shorts with Velcro patches, but otherwise retains almost all other rules of traditional rugby league (such as kicking). A number of additional rules are also added relating to the specific issues associated with a tag based game.\nLeague Tag is the primary female version of rugby league administered by the Country Rugby League. The NSWRL continues to administer the game across the state post the NSWRL-CRL merger in 2019.\nThe national team.\nThe Australian national rugby league team represents Australia at rugby league. Since 7 July 1994 the team's nickname has been the Kangaroos. Prior to that the Australian team was only referred to as the Kangaroos when on tours of Great Britain and/or France. They are administered by the Australian Rugby League and have been the most dominant national side over the past few decades.\nIn popular culture.\nRugby league has been described as \"an iconic Australian sport\" and has therefore featured prominently in Australian popular culture. Famous Australian writers throughout history such as Banjo Paterson, Thomas Keneally and Kenneth Slessor have produced literature about the game.\nMedia coverage.\nDue to the widespread interest in rugby league games played, including the State of Origin series, match results, scorelines and reports of injuries to key players, are comprehensively carried by many Australian newspapers. These include the major national daily newspapers; in general match results and reports are published on the weekend of the game and on Mondays, and commentary continues throughout the week, with rugby league-related stories usually to be found in the sporting section of the major newspapers every week-day.\nAll premiership games are broadcast on television, either free-to-air or cable. Online, the ABC, as well as major newsgroups provide articles on Rugby League, bylined in general by a reporter who is exclusively a sports correspondent. Interest in rugby league is highest in New South Wales and Queensland; as well, many of the large number of Australian expatriates living and working overseas are avidly interested in the season's games, and are able to ensure that they are kept up-to-date by accessing on-line versions of stories provided by major media organisations. Formerly, the official publication for the NRL was Big League, however, production was suspended in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, and hasn't been renewed since.\nThe 2012 State of Origin series' third and deciding game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001.\nA list of major newspapers which publish rugby league-related stories includes The Australian, The Courier-Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Sydney Morning Herald, Herald Sun and The Age. Matches are broadcast on both Channel 9, Foxtel and in New Zealand by Sky TV. \nABC radio's Grandstand programme broadcasts live rugby league games on the weekends. Sydney radio station, 2GB, also broadcasts live NRL matches Friday to Sunday (with their Continuous Call Team).\nRugby league was the biggest television sport in Australia in 2022."

        "title": "Rugby league in New Zealand",
        "text": "Rugby league in New Zealand dates to the beginning of the sport in England. New Zealand played an integral role in the history of rugby league football. Of all rugby league nations New Zealand was second only to England to compete in international competition.\nHistory.\nA professional New Zealand team was touring England and Australia before it was even considered that there should be a professional league in New Zealand. The first makings of a New Zealand rugby football schism, such as seen in other countries was the creation of Albert Henry Baskerville who set out to sign a group of professional rugby players to tour England. Baskerville's team of professional \"All Golds\", on their way to England, made a stop over in Australia, playing a 3-game series against a professional New South Wales rugby team. From there, they went on to England and for the first time, played by the Rugby Football League's rules. On their return home, they stopped over in Australia to play another 10 games against clubs from the newly formed New South Wales Rugby League. During the All Gold's tour, their founder, Baskerville fell ill and later died of pneumonia. 13 June 1908 saw the first game of rugby league played by the Northern Union's new rules on New Zealand soil; as a benefit match for Baskerville's widowed mother. The first match in New Zealand was played at Wellington on 13 June 1908 before a crowd of nearly 7,000, which saw an exhibition between two teams drawn from the touring side. Rugby league had now its sights firmly set on New Zealand, however, the New Zealand Rugby Union's dominance in New Zealand sport, government and business would prove a lot tougher than the unions of Australia or England. The NZRU took it upon themselves to pressure potential converts, officials, sponsors and ground owners into not giving the rugby league upstarts any room to move. The Wellington Rugby Union even went to the length of naming, under false pretenses, famous players in the team lineup for a match at Athletic Park in order to lure interest away from a Northern Union match being played in Petone on the same day. None of this succeeded in stopping the establishment of the game and by 1910 it was being played in Auckland, Taranaki, Rotorua, Nelson, Southland, Wanganui, Marlborough, Invercargill, Hawke's Bay, and South Auckland. The New Zealand Rugby League was formed in 1909 and other provinces joined the league. In the year after that, Auckland Rugby League became the first to start a regular competition. The Auckland League had a full season in 1912, with its headquarters at Eden Park. That same year saw the formation of Wellington's local rugby league competition. In 1913 Henry Thacker set up the Canterbury Rugby Football League, donating the Thacker Shield.\nBy the early 1990s New South Wales' club competition matches were being broadcast in New Zealand with far greater viewing numbers than that of domestic rugby union. A New Zealand club team, the Auckland Warriors, was added to the top-level Australian Rugby League competition in 1995. Soon after when the Australian Super League war shook the game to its very foundations in that country, the New Zealand Rugby League, along with the governing body in Britain, aligned itself with Super League. The Warriors continued to participate in the National Rugby League competition after many expansion teams were cut and foundation teams merged. In 2001 the club's name was changed to New Zealand Warriors.\nIn 2005, the New Zealand national side won the Tri-Nations final, beating Australia 24–0. This was the first series defeat of Australia in 25 years and also their equal biggest losing margin. The New Zealand national team won the Rugby League World Cup for the first time in 2008. In 2009, the much-mooted State of Origin-like concept called \"Kiwi Roots\", which would involve two domestic New Zealand representative teams playing each other, was announced to commence in 2010. but has yet to eventuate.\nIn 2010 a poll released by UMR Research showed that in Auckland, home of the Warriors, more people were interested in the NRL premiership (33%) than rugby union's ITM Cup (26%).\nThe finals form of the Warriors in 2011 increased the NRL's television audience in New Zealand by 29 per cent that year.\nGoverning body.\nThe New Zealand Rugby League is responsible for governing of rugby league in New Zealand. The Auckland Rugby League is a partner of the NZRL and is responsible for the governing the sport in the Auckland Region. The premier competition organised by the governing body of rugby league in New Zealand is the National Competition, formed in 2010. Significant former competitions included the Lion Red Cup, run from 1994–96, the Bartercard Cup, run from 2000–07, and the Bartercard Premiership, run from 2008–09.\nOn a regional level, the sport is administered by seven zones and fifteen districts and has seven Affiliates.\nZones\nDistricts\nAffiliates\nNew Zealand based teams also take part in Australian competitions. New Zealand Warriors are the only non-Australian team in the National Rugby League and the New South Wales Cup.\nNational Competition.\nThe NZRL National Competition (previously called the \"National Zonal Competition\") is the top-level rugby league competition run by the New Zealand Rugby League. In 2010 the competition replaced the Bartercard Premiership following a Sparc funded review and restructure of the New Zealand Rugby League. Since 2019, the competition has consisted of a four-team national premiership and an eight-team national championship (split into North and South Island Conferences) with a promotion and relegation between the two divisions.\nTeams playing in Australia.\nThe National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's top-level competition for the sport of rugby league and the New Zealand Warriors are New Zealand's only team in the NRL; in addition they have a \"B team\" in the NSW Cup, one of Australia's second tier state competitions. The club also fields a team in the NRL Women's Premiership. Wellington Orcas unsuccessfully bid for a National Rugby League licence in 2006.\nIn May 2022, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo mentioned a second New Zealand team to be an option for a potential 18th NRL Team.\nNational team.\nThe New Zealand national rugby league team represent New Zealand at rugby league, and are commonly known as the Kiwis, after the native bird of that name. They are administered by the New Zealand Rugby League. On 22 October 2008, The Kiwis defeated Australia to win their first Rugby League World Cup. The team's most recent title came in the 2014 Rugby League Four Nations tournament by beating Australia, which brings their Rugby League Four Nations championships total to two. \nThe national team reached the semi-finals of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup where they were knocked out by Australia. The Kiwis are currently the number two ranked rugby league nation (as of December 2022)."

        "text": "Rugby league is played across England but is most popular in Northern England, especially Yorkshire and Lancashire where the game originated. These areas are the heartland of rugby league. The sport is also popular in Cumbria where the amateur game is particularly powerful.\nName.\nWithin its Northern heartlands, rugby league is often referred to as \"rugby\", a term that in the rest of England would normally refer to rugby union, and occasionally as \"football\", which even in the North of England normally refers to association football.\nHistory.\nFoundations.\nRugby has long been popular in the North of England and by the 1880s the region's clubs had come to dominate. The game was popular amongst working class people, unlike the clubs in Southern England whose players belonged to the middle or upper class. Rugby competition at the time did not allow paying players any wages; the working class players felt they could not afford time off to train and play, nor could they afford to miss work through injury sustained whilst playing. The principle of amateurism, and issues of class ensured that the Rugby Football Union would not countenance professional rugby.\nIn August 1895, representatives of the northern clubs met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield to form the \"\"Northern Rugby Football Union\" (NRFU)\". The NRFU was initially vehemently anti-professional, allowing only payments for time missed from other employment. A thriving amateur scene also soon developed, as local amateur clubs wished to maintain links with their \"Northern Union\" neighbours.\nThe Northern Union made reforms to the laws in 1897 and again in 1906 in an effort make the game more exciting. This resulted in Northern Union football becoming a sport in its own right rather than a form of rugby union.\nThe sport spread outside England and soon international matches began to be played. The first international match was played in 1904 as England was beaten 9–3 at Central Park, Wigan by \"Other Nationalities\" (largely Welsh players). This was followed by a tour of Britain by New Zealand in 1907. New Zealand met Great Britain in Great Britain's first ever Test match at Headingley, Leeds on 18 January 1908. The same year the first Australian Kangaroos tourists visited Britain. In 1910 the first British tour to Australia and New Zealand took place.\nThe Challenge Cup began in 1897 with Batley beating St Helens to win the first title.\nThe final was first broadcast by BBC radio in 1927. The Wembley tradition was started in 1929 when Wigan beat Dewsbury 13–2 at the first Rugby League Challenge Cup to be held at Wembley.\nRugby league continued to be played throughout the 1914–15 season, however, the loss of players to the First World War, a government ban on professionalism and reduced attendances forced all major competitions to be replaced by regional competitions. The NRFU became the Rugby Football League in 1922.\nThe 1930s saw a series of failed attempts to introduce rugby league football to London.\nDuring the Second World War professional rugby league was again discontinued, normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel.\nPost-war.\nIn 1948 the first televised rugby league match was played when Wigan's 8–3 Challenge Cup Final victory over Bradford Northern was broadcast to the Midlands. In another first this was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy.\nSeveral attempts were made to expand the game outside the heartlands, a Southern Amateur Rugby League being formed in 1949, however only Cumberland and southern areas of the West Riding of Yorkshire proved receptive with teams being founded in Workington, Whitehaven and Doncaster. Nonetheless the game survived, and continued to maintain popularity in its home regions. The introduction of regular internationals as other countries took up the sport provided a fillip.\nRugby league experienced a surge in interest following the end of the Second World War. Large crowds came to be the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949–50, when over 69.8 million paying customers attended all matches.\nThe 1953–54 Challenge Cup Final replay between Halifax and Warrington, held at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, drew 102,575 paying spectators with an estimated 20,000 others getting in free after a section of fencing collapsed.\nThe boom had begun to subside by the early 1960s; rugby league now had to compete against television and other new forms of entertainment and attendances began to fall. David Attenborough, then controller of BBC2, made the decision to screen games from a new competition the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy in 1965. It proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since.\nAttendances fell even further in the 1970s. Britain won the Ashes for the last time in 1970, with a 2–1 series win in Australia.\nThe foundation of the Universities and Colleges Rugby League in 1969 and the British Amateur Rugby League Association in 1973 was a response to the need to develop the game below professional level.\n1980–1990.\nIn 1980, Fulham F.C. formed a rugby league team, with the intention of creating another income stream for the association football club. The Rugby Football League was keen to expand outside the heartlands and accepted the new club (now known as London Broncos). This was not the first rugby league club to be based in London — three London-based clubs had come and gone in the 1930s — but unlike past ventures the new team survived despite several moves and name changes, and are now London Broncos.\nThe 1982 Kangaroos won all their tour games for first time ever, and became known as \"The Invincibles\". This was the time when the gap between English and Australian rugby league became apparent and has never been fully closed.\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group was formed in 1987 to support the sport of rugby league and tackle the key issues facing the game in Parliament. Ian McCartney MP was the first chairman and David Hinchliffe MP the secretary. In 1987 a \"free gangway\" between the two codes of rugby at amateur level was introduced but individual cases of discrimination continued, resulting in the Sports (Discrimination) Bill, which was introduced by David Hinchcliffe in 1994.\nIn the mid 1980s Wigan began an era of domination of English rugby league that would end only with the formation of Super League. By 1995 they had won the Challenge Cup a record eight consecutive times and the league title for a record seven consecutive times.\nThe traditional Origin series between Yorkshire and Lancashire was abandoned in 1989. Although the matches had provided a good test for selecting players for the full England and Great Britain sides, the crowds had been poor and the games had little attraction for the rest of the country. The series was revived again in 2001 before being abandoned in 2003.\nThe Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) was formed in 1994 after the official recognition of rugby league by the armed services, since then rugby league has been the fastest growing army sport. The rival code rugby union went professional in 1995 and, as a result, other restrictions on rugby league were relaxed by the Rugby Football Union. This opened up the possibility of expanding the game into areas where it had never been played before as it allowed rugby league clubs to groundshare with rugby union clubs and for union players to try out the other code without fear of persecution.\n1995–present: Summer era.\nIn 1995, the fallout from the Super League war hit Britain, and the game underwent massive re-organisation. A new elite league, Super League was formed, and the sport switched from a winter to a summer season. Super League has largely been a success as the value of its TV contract and top tier game crowd attendances and have both grown year upon year since 2001.\nThe Rugby League Conference was founded in 1998 with the aim of providing regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league. It began with fourteen teams, but within nine years had grown to eighty-eight clubs spread throughout England and the rest of Britain.\nGoverning bodies.\nRugby Football League.\nThe Rugby Football League (RFL) is the governing body for the sport in England. Previously, before the emergence of Wales Rugby League, Scotland Rugby League and Rugby League Ireland the RFL had control over the whole United Kingdom.\nThe RFL are affiliated with the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) and the Rugby League European Federation (RLEF). The Community Board is made up of representatives of the RFL, BARLA, Combined Services, English Schools Rugby League and Student Rugby League.\nBritish Amateur Rugby League Association.\nBritish Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) are responsible for amateur rugby league chiefly in the sport's north of England heartlands. Though many Rugby League Conference teams are affiliated to BARLA, the Conference itself is not a BARLA organisation. The top division under their control is the National Conference League, with regional leagues including the North West Counties and Pennine leagues. BARLA selects an international team consisting of amateur players, the BARLA Lions. This team tours many parts of the rugby league world, and have competed in the Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament.\nArmed Forces.\nRugby league was recognised as a military sport in 1994. The Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) is the co-ordinating group for the Army Rugby League, Royal Navy Rugby League and the Royal Air Force Rugby League. Each constituent body organises its own competitions at unit and formation level. Players are fed into representative teams to represent each of the services, and the best players are selected to represent the Combined Services.\nWomen's Amateur Rugby League Association.\nThe Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (WARLA) is the governing body of female rugby league in the United Kingdom; it currently falls under the Rugby Football League association which oversees its running and management. It was originally established in 1985 and was recognised by the RFL in its first year.\nTouch Rugby.\nIn December 2021, the RFL agreed a new partnership with the England Touch Association, the national governing body for touch rugby.\nThe two bodies aim to work closely together in a formal relationship in 2022, when England will host the delayed European Touch Championships in Nottingham.\nTag Rugby.\nThe RFL is the governing body of Try Tag Rugby, which delivers mixed, men’s and women’s leagues for adults across the country.\nOpen age competitions.\nSuper League.\nSuper League is the top league for the game in Europe; eleven of the twelve teams are based in England. It is the only full-time professional rugby league competition operating in the Northern Hemisphere. The French team Paris Saint-Germain competed in the first Super League season but folded in 1999. French presence was re-established in 2006 when Catalans Dragons were admitted to Super League. In 2009, Super League added Celtic Crusaders from Wales, which renamed themselves Crusaders Rugby League after that season; that team effectively folded after the 2011 season. The winner of the league is awarded the League Leaders' Shield whilst the overall winner of Super League is determined by play-offs and a grand final.\nThe winner of the Super League plays the winner of the Australian NRL competition in the World Club Challenge.\nChampionship and League 1.\nBelow Super League, there are the Championship and League 1. The Championship currently has 14 clubs and League 1 has 11. The 2015 season marked the return of a promotion and relegation system between Super League and the Championship; from 2009 through to 2014 promotion between the Championship and Super League had been on a licensed, or franchised, basis. Promotion and relegation between the leagues now known as the Championship and League 1 has long existed, including during the 2009–14 period.\nFollowing the 2014 season, the professional leagues underwent a major reorganisation. Super League and the Championship were both reduced from 14 clubs to 12, and League 1 was expanded from nine clubs to 14. The season structures of both Super League and the Championship were radically changed, and that of League 1 was more modestly changed.\nWales became represented in the Championships starting in 2010 with the entry of South Wales Scorpions into League 1 and North Wales Crusaders in 2012. Toulouse Olympique of France played in the Championship in the past, and returned to the British league system in 2016, initially playing in League 1 and now in the Championship. The Toronto Wolfpack from Canada joined League 1 in 2017 and won the title in its inaugural season, thereby earning promotion to the Championship for 2018. All other clubs in both divisions are based in England, and of these, only London Broncos of the Championship and Newcastle Thunder, London Skolars, Gloucestershire All Golds, Hemel Stags, Coventry Bears and Oxford Rugby League of League 1 are based outside the heartlands.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Rugby League Challenge Cup remains as a knock-out competition, though entry has now been expanded to make it a pan-European tournament bringing in teams from France, Canada and the rest of the UK; Russian teams have previously featured. Amateur teams also have the chance to participate in the Challenge Cup and have been victorious over several Championship sides.\nNational Conference League.\nBARLA administer different amateur competitions which traditionally ran throughout the winter in the heartlands but have mostly switched over to a summer season. The leading competition is the National Conference League which consists of four divisions (Premier Division, Division One, Division Two and Division Three) of up to 14 teams each. Other major amateur leagues include the Yorkshire Men's League, North West Men's League, Pennine League, Cumberland League, Barrow &amp; District League and the Hull &amp; District League. Teams from these regional leagues can apply for election to the National Conference League if they meet minimum criteria.\nThe Rugby League Conference, which ran until 2011, was mostly composed of teams outside the heartlands. It has subsequently been replaced by a series of regional leagues across England, Scotland and Wales. Successor leagues in England include: Conference League South, Midlands Rugby League, North East Rugby League, South West Rugby League, East Men's League, South Premier, London &amp; South East Men's League.\nDefunct competitions.\nAt various times English clubs have either competed in a national Championship with a Second Division and sometimes a Third Division as well or had separate county leagues for Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nThere were also county cups for Yorkshire and Lancashire between 1905 and 1993. The Regal Trophy and BBC2 Floodlit Trophy were two other knock-out tournaments. A Trans-Pennine Cup was played for a short-time but it was replaced by the National League Cup.\nThe Rugby League Charity Shield was a one-off match at the beginning of each season between 1985 and 1995. It was contested by the Champions and the holders of the Challenge Cup.\nThe rugby union county championship was continued as a rugby league County Championship after the 1895 great schism. Teams representing Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumberland / Cumbria and sometimes Cheshire and Northumberland &amp; Durham took part in the championship. This continued as the Rugby League War of the Roses played between Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nThe Championship Cup was a cup competition for the Championship and Championship 1 (now League 1).\nNational teams.\nEngland.\nOn 5 April 1904, England played their first game, losing 9–3 to Other Nationalities in a 12-a-side match at Wigan. With the exception of 1975, England was represented by Great Britain in international tournaments, but since 1995 has competed as a standalone nation. Unlike Great Britain, an England side has never won the World Cup, and non-World Cup matches involving England were not deemed to have Test status, which applied only to the full Great Britain side.\nOutside of the World Cup, England are one of three automatic qualifiers to the Rugby League Four Nations, alongside New Zealand and Australia, finishing as losing finalists at the inaugural tournament in 2009. Regular tests against France have seen England go undefeated since 1981, with an International Origin series occasionally played against overseas players based in the Super League to provide stronger competition.\nBetween 1935 and 2004 England competed in the European Nations Cup. In recent years they had come to dominate this tournament, and in 2005 they withdrew to level the playing field, with a return planned for 2023.\nIn the reduced formats of the game, England took part in the defunct Rugby League World Sevens in 2002 and 2003, losing in the latter final to Parramatta Eels. The 2019 Rugby League World Cup 9s saw England reach the semi-final, losing to New Zealand at Bankwest Stadium, Sydney.\nA developmental England Knights team has been selected since 2002. Previously known as England A, the Knights consist of promising players who miss out on selection to the senior squad. An England Lionhearts squad is selected from the Rugby League Conference, competing annually with the other home nations in the Amateur Four Nations, as well as fixtures against other nations.\nGreat Britain.\nThe Great Britain side is also referred to as \"the Lions\" or \"the British Lions\". At international level the Women's Great Britain side is commonly referred to as the Great Britain Lionesses.\nEngland historically provided the vast majority of players for the Great Britain team, one of the major national teams playing rugby league. They compete against Australia for the Ashes, and New Zealand for the Baskerville Shield.\nThe first Great Britain match took place on 18 January 1908 when they beat New Zealand 14–6 at Headingley. Apart from the 1975 tournament, Great Britain took part in the Rugby League World Cup from its inception in 1954 until 1992, winning the tournament on three occasions: 1954, 1960 and 1972.\nGreat Britain also played in the Rugby League Tri-Nations until 2006 against New Zealand and Australia. Although Great Britain never won the tournament, they finished top of the table in 2005, losing to Australia in the final.\nIn 2007 Great Britain was replaced by separate teams for each of the home nations, returning only for a 2019 tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Two losses against the Kiwis in Auckland and Christchurch were book-ended by defeats against Tonga in Hamilton and Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby The whitewash attracted criticism from the British rugby league press, with the future viability of the team called into question.\nPlayer awards.\nThe main two awards are the Lance Todd Trophy which is awarded to the Man-of-the-Match in the Challenge Cup Final whether on the winning or losing side and the Man of Steel Award which is the annual award for the best player in Super League.\nThe Albert Goldthorpe Medal is an award that has been created by Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express to honour the leading players in Super League.\nThe Rugby League World Golden Boot Award is given to the international player of the year, as determined by a ballot of international rugby league writers and broadcasters. Until 2007, this was accompanied by the RLIF Awards which rewarded the best referee, coach, developing nations player, international newcomer, captain and a team of the year.\nDerbies.\nMany of the professional teams are separated by only a few miles but not all matches between teams from the same traditional county are considered derbies. There has been some debate as to whether St. Helens versus Wigan or Bradford versus Leeds is the biggest derby in English rugby league but there is only one same city derby in the Super League – Hull F.C. v Hull Kingston Rovers.\nSome of the teams involved no longer play in the same league and so derby games are either arranged as pre-season friendlies or take place as part of the Challenge Cup.\nJunior rugby league.\nRugby league is played at a school level in many schools in the heartlands; recently it has been introduced into some schools outside the traditional areas in particular in London and Hertfordshire.\nThe RFL uses two modified forms of rugby league created by ARL Development in Australia. Mini league (known as mini footy in Australia) is played by all children up to Year 4 of Primary School. It is designed to provide children with a safe environment, a firm knowledge of the laws of rugby league and a chance to practice the skills such as tackling, passing and common defensive and attacking tactics. Players up to and including Year 6 of Primary School play mod league. Mod league is a bridge between mini league and full contact rugby league. On completion of mod league, players make a move to full international rugby league laws.\nThe Champion Schools tournament is a national competition for secondary schools. In the 2005/06 academic year over 1,200 teams and 20,000 players competed in the Champion Schools tournament, making it the largest rugby league competition in the world. Eighty percent of participants are new to rugby league. The growth of the Champion Schools tournament led to the creation of the Carnegie Champion Colleges competition for Years 12 and 13. The regionally based competition was introduced in 2008 and started in January.\nBritish Amateur Rugby League Association runs the Gilette National Youth League as well as the Yorkshire combination, Hull Youth and Junior and London Junior League.\nSuper League and National League teams run academy sides to develop young talent. Players under the age of 21 years are eligible to play for the senior academy, the rules also permit three players over the age of 21 to play in academy matches. Junior academies are the second tier in the Youth Development system. Only players under the age of 18 years are eligible to play for the junior academy; no players over the age limit are allowed to play. Some of the better junior academy players may get experience in the senior academy and it is not uncommon for some players to play regularly in both junior and senior academies.\nStudent Rugby League.\nAlthough the game remains close to its working class origins, changes in social demographics and attitudes have allowed many working-class people to attend university where they have continued their association with the game.\nThe Student Rugby League was founded in 1967 when a team was created at Leeds University by Andrew Cudbertson, Jack Abernathy and Cec Thompson, other teams soon joined in areas of the United Kingdom which lay outside of the games traditional heartlands.\nThe first university game was between Leeds and Liverpool in 1968. A year later the Universities and Colleges Rugby League was formed after student pioneers fought hard to get the sport recognised in higher education. The first Oxford versus Cambridge University match took place in 1981. The varsity match has \"discretionary full blue\" status. The game is now played in over 70 universities.\nRugby league in universities has been an important vehicle for expansion of the game as players from outside the heartlands often first began to play at university level. Many continue to play after leaving university and this has led to the creation of teams in non-traditional areas such as London Skolars and Gloucestershire All Golds.\nDerivatives of rugby league.\nRugby league sevens is particularly popular with pub teams drawn from the regulars at a pub; it is often difficult for a single public house to form a full squad of 13 players and 4 substitutes.\nRugby league nines is the more common form of the shortened version of the game. The Carnegie Floodlit Nines, Middlesex 9s and the York International 9s are three of the best known rugby league nines tournaments in England. The York nines began in 2002 and the Middlesex nines a year later. All three competitions feature professional and amateur teams from England as well as teams from abroad.\nTouch Rugby is administered by Rugby Football League through a product known as Play Touch Rugby League.\nTry Tag Rugby are the RFL's official Tag Rugby League partners, running leagues in London, Yorkshire and the Thames Valley.\nWheelchair rugby league was first introduced to England in 2005. The first competitive league began in 2009.\nMasters Rugby League which uses modified rules to allow older players to continue playing has only recently arrived in England and is not widely played.\nStadiums.\nThere are 36 stadiums in England considered to be rugby league stadiums, most of these are shared with association football teams. The largest club venue is the Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford Bulls, and has a capacity of 27,500.\nThere is no national stadium for rugby league in England. Despite this Wembley Stadium is annually used as the venue of the Challenge Cup Final, and Old Trafford as the venue of the Super League Grand Final.\nThe Super League's Magic Weekend is used to promote rugby league to a wider audience. The Millennium Stadium, Murrayfield, Etihad Stadium, St James' Park, and Anfield have all be used to host the event. Elland Road will host the 2024 Super League Magic Weekend.\nPopularity.\nRugby league is the fourth most popular team sport in England. Historically, rugby league has been the second biggest spectator sport in England with 6.8 million spectators attending the 1948–1949 English season.\nRugby league is most popular in its traditional heartlands and, in those areas, interest in the sport can rival that of association football. Many large towns with rugby league traditions do not have football teams as a result of the monopoly on local interest: these towns include, Keighley, Castleford, Dewsbury, Batley and Wakefield.\nThe regions in which rugby league is played most are Cumbria, where the amateur version has a high participation rate, former traditional Lancashire regions Merseyside and Greater Manchester, Yorkshire and Cheshire. There is also significant schools participation in London. Many of the professional and semi-professional teams are connected by the M62 motorway and so the term \"M62 corridor\" is sometimes used to refer to the area where rugby league is most popular. An old survey from 1994 showed that back then, sixty per cent of people regularly attending rugby league lived in only four postal districts along the M62. The sport has since launched several expansion teams in the south.\nFifty per cent of viewers who watch rugby league on Sky Sports live in the South of England. Over 40% of active rugby league supporters are female. At the beginning of the 2006 season there were between thirty and forty female-only rugby league clubs running in England, not including clubs that have teams of both sexes. The majority of these clubs are located in Lancashire and Yorkshire.\nRugby league has for much of its history been banned in the armed forces and in many schools and universities, further stifling growth. These barriers have largely been dismantled since professionalisation of rugby union.\nThe 2006 Super League generated the highest weekly average attendance in the 11-year history of the competition. The average weekly attendance for the regular season stood at 9,026, generated by an aggregate attendance of 1,516,342 supporters. This is an increase on the 2005 season average of 8,887. The attendances are not evenly spread between clubs within Super League; whilst the best supported team, Leeds with average gates of 15,683, a couple of clubs failed to attract averages of above 5,000. Crowds at matches below the top flight can exceed 3,500, however most of the clubs in this division have attendances lower than this.\nAlthough attendances outside Super League can be quite low, many of the teams play in small towns and the attendance figures represent a large percentage of the local population; as far down as amateur level. An example is Saddleworth Rangers which represents a largely rural area to the East of Oldham towards the Pennines; however the club's stadium contains a covered seated stand and triple figure support for home games.\nCurrent trends.\nThe success of Super League in England and the return of competitive international matches with Australia and New Zealand have seen growth for the sport.\nThe ending of discrimination against rugby league resulting from professionalism in rugby union led to an increase in numbers in the amateur game, with many rugby union amateurs keen to try out the other code. In 2004 the Rugby Football League was able to report a 94% increase in registered players in just two years, whilst attendance figures for Super League matches rose 8% from the 2003 season.\nThe annual Champion Schools competition from 2003 onwards has increased the number of school teams from 300 to 1,500 and the participation levels to 25,000 from 6,000. Though these figures include participants from Wales. The number of participants involved in the 2011–12 Carnegie Champion schools tournament was a record 30,713 players across 1819 teams making it the largest rugby league competition in the world.\nWhilst rugby union was officially an amateur sport, many rugby union players came to play rugby league. In recent years this trend has reversed and some rugby league players have crossed codes to play union.\nExpansion by the governing body, the Rugby Football League sees continual growth in the south of England, notably the London area, which now boasts three professional clubs. These are, London Broncos, London Skolars and Hemel Stags. One of the prime vehicles for expansion has been the Rugby League Conference, a set of competitions for clubs in those development areas.\nMedia.\nPublications.\nIn 1989 George Moorhouse's \"At the George\" was shortlisted for the inaugural William Hill Sports Book of the Year.\nThere are two weekly rugby league newspapers, \"Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express\" with around 23,000 subscribers and League Weekly with around 11,000 subscribers. In and around the heartlands, these publications are stocked in newsagents but in the rest of England they are only available via subscription.

Professional black players first took to the professional rugby league pitch prior to the First World War. George Bennett became the first black player to play for Great Britain while it was another 44 years before Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to play association football for England. Clive Sullivan became the first black captain of the Great Britain team in 1972, 21 years before Paul Ince became the first black captain of England's association football team. Roy Francis was the first black coach of a leading club, almost half a century before the top flight of English association football would have a black British manager, a milestone also achieved by Ince (on 22 June 2008). Ellery Hanley earned the distinction of being the first black coach of any British national sporting team when he took charge of Great Britain in the home Ashes series of 1994.\nIn 1997 the Rugby Football League launched a thirteen-point action plan aimed at tackling racism and encouraging the development of rugby league in Asian and black communities. Despite the sport being popular in West Yorkshire and the North West, which both have large South Asian communities, the sport has little following amongst South Asian communities. The British Asian Rugby Association (BARA) was set up in 2004 to encouraging participation in rugby among British Asians.\nIn 2012, the Rugby Football League were awarded the Stonewall Sport Award in recognition of their work in embracing inclusivity and tackling homophobia. They also became the first UK sporting organisation to make the top 100 employers in the Stonewall Index that measures attitudes towards lesbian, gay and bisexual staff."

        "text": "Rugby league is a popular team sport played in Fiji since 1992.\nHistory.\nJoe Levula and Orisi Dawai were the first Fijians to play rugby league after they were recruited to play professionally for the Rochdale Hornets in 1961. Voate Driu and Laitia Ravouvou joined the club the next year, with numerous others following throughout the 1960s and 1970s. These players largely remained in Rochdale after their careers.\nIn 1992, a number of high-profile Fijian rugby union representatives converted to rugby league and entered the Rugby League World Sevens, for which they received lifetime bans from the Fiji Rugby Union. Under the guidance of Bob Abbott (from the Australian Rugby League), a six-team rugby league competition was established in Fiji later that same year. The competition used match payments to attract players from rugby union, with FJ$40 (AU$38) offered per win and FJ$10 per loss. The sport was supported by Sitiveni Rabuka, who served as President of the Fiji Rugby League (FRL) during that period.\nThe FRL aligned itself with the News Corp-backed Super League during the Super League war. Suva hosted the inaugural Super League World Nines in February 1996, which reportedly brought $1.3 million into the local economy. Under the Super League, the FRL grew from eight clubs with one team each to twelve clubs with two teams each. Abbott and the Australian Rugby League had meanwhile established a small competition in western Fiji.\n2001 was the last year in which payments were offered to rugby league players in Fiji.\nThe first women's club rugby league match in the country was played on 26 March 2016, between Bemana and the Coastal Roos.\nIn 2020, the Kaiviti Silktails entered the NSWRL's third tier Ron Massey Cup, with entry to the second tier New South Wales Cup guaranteed for 2021. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plans were delayed by one year. The team draws its players from Fiji's local competition.\nDomestic Competitions.\nVodafone Cup.\nThe Fiji National Rugby League runs the national domestic rugby league competition in Fiji. Known as the Vodafone Cup, the competition features 32 teams across two conferences, each with two zones. The competition was formed in 1998, and has been Fiji's top level rugby league competition ever since.\nTeams.\nThe FNRL Vodafone Cup is the top club competition for men's rugby league in Fiji.\nIt was previously divided into two conferences (East and West).

        "text": "Rugby league () is a comparatively minor sport in Scotland, dwarfed by the popularity of association football and rugby union, and to a lesser extent curling, ice hockey and shinty. With the introduction of rugby league into a small number schools and the formation of youth rugby league in Scotland it has seen juniors being signed to Super League clubs.\nHistory.\nIn 1895, there was a schism within the game of rugby in neighbouring England which saw the sport of rugby divided. Rugby union remained amateur and rugby league permitted payments to players. However, no such split took place in Scotland where the clubs continued to play rugby union. 14 Scottish players would cross over and play rugby league in England before amateurism was abandoned.\nThe history of rugby league in Scotland goes back to 1909 when the touring Australian team drew 17–17 with a Northern Rugby Football Union representative side at Celtic Park, Glasgow. A further match against the Australians followed at Tynecastle, Edinburgh in 1911, again an 11–11 tie. After this the Rugby Football League largely gave up on expansion north of the border.\nNonetheless, a number of Scottish rugby union players, particularly from the Border region, moved south to play for English clubs. The numbers were not nearly so great as with Welsh players (see Rugby league in Wales), and a Scottish national team was never seriously considered, though Scots did feature for \"Other Nationalities\" and were eligible for Great Britain.\nProbably the most famous figure in Scottish rugby league during this period was Dave Valentine, who captained Great Britain to World Cup victory in 1954.\nIn 1989, a Scotland students side was formed at the University of Aberdeen, and this proved to be the catalyst for the formation of a number of other clubs. The national team first played in 1995, and a domestic league followed in 1997.\nIn 2000 and 2002 the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final was held at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, the home of the Scottish Rugby Union. In 2000 Bradford Bulls defeated Leeds Rhinos 24–18, and in 2002 Wigan Warriors beat St. Helens 21–12. Both ties were played in front of over 60,000 spectators, by far the biggest rugby league events ever held in Scotland.\nGoverning body.\nScotland Rugby League is the governing body for rugby league in Scotland overseeing development and participation at all levels of the sport.\nCompetitions.\nSenior.\nThe Scottish National League is the highest tier exclusively Scottish rugby league competition and comprises four teams: Aberdeen Warriors, Ayrshire Storm, Easterhouse Panthers, and Edinburgh Eagles. The league is governed by Scotland Rugby League, despite this it listed as a BARLA fifth tier regional league in the British rugby league system. This allows for promotion and relegation between the different levels however there is no direct transfer and any promotion to higher levels of the pyramid is done by application to the Rugby Football League who operate the top three professional levels of the British system. Currently, no Scottish sides have played in the higher tiers of the pyramid.\nJunior.\nThe Saltire Schools Cup is a nationwide Scottish schools competition for boys and girls from S1–S4 school age groups. The National Youth League is competed for at under-17 and under-15 level.\nNational team.\nThere are two Scottish teams selected: \"Scotland\" and \"Scotland A\". The Scotland team is predominantly second-generation professional players, born and bred in England, whereas the Scotland A team (nicknamed \"the Bravehearts\") is selected from the domestic Scottish competition.\nScotland has participated in the Emerging Nations Cup (1995), in every World Cup since 2000, and European Nations Cup (since 2003) competitions.\nSince 2002, Scotland A has participated in the Amateur Four Nations competition and toured Italy, the Netherlands, and Serbia.\nPopularity.\nRugby league is a contracting sport in Scotland largely caused by the reduction in funding from the RFL, attracting stagnating interest. In addition to the four clubs in the Scottish National League, there are a small number of other clubs. The majority of the clubs are based in and around Glasgow, and Glasgow City Council provide funding for junior teams.\nMedia.\nThere are two weekly rugby league newspapers, \"Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express\" and \"League Weekly\", and two monthly magazines, \"Rugby League World\" and \"Thirteen Magazine\". These cover the sport worldwide and across the UK. These publications are usually only available by subscription in Scotland.\nBBC Sport own the rights to broadcast a highlights package called the \"Super League Show\" which was first broadcast in Scotland in 2008. Prior to this it had only been broadcast in the North of England. \"Rugby League Raw\" is not broadcast in Scotland despite the BBC owning the rights to do so.

        "text": "Rugby league is a sport played in Wales. The governing body of the game in Wales is the Wales Rugby League.\nThere is a long but sporadic history of rugby league in Wales (). Over the decades hundreds of Welsh players have played for the leading English clubs. Consequently, the national side, nicknamed the Dragons, have often been a very strong force in the international game.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nRugby football was an increasingly popular sport for Wales in the 1890s, and particularly in the south where its popularity surpassed that of association football. The Welsh coal miners shared the same working class ethos of the miners from the northern counties of England. The impending schism of 1895 tore apart the English rugby union and in the early 1900s, the shock waves were being felt in rugby worldwide, though there was little desire in Wales to embrace professionalism. Amateurism in Wales was seen as a means of holding together a community in which there were expectations by the public on their sportsman to not turn their back on international rugby. The Welsh took pride in the position rugby gave them in the sporting world, and therefore the Welsh Rugby Union saw little attraction in turning professional.\nNonetheless, many Welsh players signed for English clubs. The Northern Union's administrators began to ponder the possibilities of international competitions against an English representative side. The first attempt met with a lack of public interest, and the first scheduled Northern Union international, also became the first postponed Northern Union international. It was rescheduled for the 5 April 1904. The team opposing England was labelled Other Nationalities and consisted of Welshmen and a few Scots. The Other Nationalities proved too strong, defeating the English 9 - 3. In 1905, England gained back some credibility with a 21 - 11 win.\nIn 1907 a professional version of the \"All Blacks\" rugby team from New Zealand (nicknamed the All Golds by Australian press) toured England in what became the first set of international games played under the new NU rules. The All Golds had not played under the Northern Union rules and underwent a week of intensive training. The first Wales international league game took place at Aberdare on 1 January 1908 played against the All Golds. Wales went on to defeat New Zealand 9-8, the winning try scored by former Wales rugby union international Dai Jones.\nFirst Welsh Clubs.\nIn 1907, the Welsh Northern Union was formed in Wrexham, but the Northern Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the South of Wales and the WNU soon folded. In 1907 two Welsh clubs Ebbw Vale RLFC and Merthyr Tydfil RLFC joined the Northern Union and also competed in the Challenge Cup.\nIn the 1908-09 season, there were sufficient numbers of Welsh clubs to run a separate Welsh League section of the competition, alongside the Northern Union's Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues. The Welsh League lasted only two seasons before folding in 1910 after most of the competing teams disbanded.\nIn 1926, the RFL formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league.\nFrom 1949 to 1955 a Welsh league was run by the Welsh commission but it was disbanded due to lack of interest and finance. Founder members were Neath, Cardiff, Llanelli, Bridgend, Ystradgynlais, Aberavon, Amman Vale and Blaina.\nHarsh economic times in the 1980s meant that rugby union players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs \"went north\" to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living. This flow of players was halted when rugby union became professional in 1995.\nIn the early 21st century rugby league gained in popularity in Wales. Matches between teams in the Welsh Premier division generally draw crowds of around 300 spectators.\nWith the Rugby League Conference’s growth throughout England, the RFL and its WRL arm set up an amateur club, the Cardiff Demons who joined the Central South Division of the Rugby League Conference in 2001. The Demons, who were mainly made up of former players from the university UWIC rugby league club, were quite successful and instantly saw interest from other parts of Wales grow.\nIn 2002, two former students of Swansea University decided to set up a local club called the Swansea Bulls, now Swansea Valley Miners, with a view to playing friendly matches against the Demons and other touring clubs. Peter Thomas and Gareth Jones, both former Welsh Student RL team members, started an amateur team out of the Morriston R.F.C. ground with a mixture of university and local union players. Junior teams soon started playing league and one team, coached by Neville Price, was coached by the Bradford Bulls team coaches on a weekend tour.\nFirst All-Welsh Competition.\nThe following year in 2003, the RLC expand creating the Welsh Premier division (now the South Wales Premiership). The inaugural competition had six open-age sides.\nThe record attendance for any rugby league game in Wales was set in 2005 with 74,213 attending the Challenge Cup final in Cardiff.\nWales Rugby League achieved governing body status in 2005 and employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006.\nThe Rugby Football League (RFL) took an entire round of Super League matches to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on the weekend of 5–6 May 2007. This was called Millennium Magic.\nIn 2012 the North Wales Conference was formed.\nIn recent years, due to the increase in popularity of league in Wales, there have been efforts to present the South Wales Premiership and North Wales Conference as first tier competitions within Wales and not just a fifth tier UK league. As of 2023, winners of both sides will play in the first all Welsh grand final for a place in the Challenge Cup, previously only available to South Welsh teams.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rugby Football League were the governing body for rugby league in the UK. They were formed as the Northern Rugby Union in 1895.\nIn 1907, the \"Welsh Northern Union\" was formed in Wrexham, but the Northern Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the South of Wales, which is the heartland of Welsh rugby union, and the WNU soon folded.\nIn 1926, the newly renamed RFL formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league.\nThe Wales Rugby League was formed in 1995 and recognised at that time as the governing body of rugby league in Wales by the Rugby Football League, the British Amateur Rugby League Association and the Welsh Sports Council. It employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006.\nWales became the 12th full member of the Rugby League International Federation following a meeting of the Federation board in Melbourne in May 2010.\nWelsh professional clubs.\nThere have been various attempts to introduce professional rugby league to Wales throughout the 20th century. Merthyr Tydfil and Ebbw Vale joined for the 1907/08 season; followed closely behind Aberdare, Barry, Mid-Rhondda and Treherbert joined in 1908/09. The 1908/09 season saw the first Welsh League, played alongside the Northern Union League.\nAberdare, Barry, and Mid-Rhondda dropped out after that season, with Treherbert following the next year. Merthyr Tydfil lasted until 1910/11, and Ebbw Vale was the last of these to leave, after 1911/12. The next Welsh club was Pontypridd, who joined in 1926/27; only to dropped out after 8 games of the 1927/28 season. A Cardiff club participated in the 1951/52 season, but disbanded after that season.\nFollowing the example of Fulham F.C. (who founded the RL team that is now London Broncos), Cardiff City F.C. decided to enter a team for the 1981/82 season. The Blue Dragons, as they were known, shared Ninian Park with the Bluebirds until the 1983/84 season, when the club went into liquidation. They were then moved to Bridgend for the 1984/85 season, where they placed on the bottom of the table, and were expelled after the season for failing to obtain a home ground. Another attempt to establish a professional rugby league club was made in the 1990s. South Wales finished 6th in the Second Division in 1996, and, because of small crowds, withdrew from the league before the following season.\nThere are now two professional rugby league clubs in Wales. The Crusaders Rugby League team, based in Wrexham, played in the Super League competition up until 2011. After going into administration they have become North Wales Crusaders. The second club is Llanelli-based West Wales Raiders established in 2017 following the demise of the South Wales Ironmen side which were based in Merthyr Tydfil. Both teams currently play in League 1.\nCurrent RFL and BARLA teams.\nThe following is a list of current Welsh rugby league clubs along with the league they play in:\nCompetitions and League System.\nSenior.\nClub rugby league in Wales is played in a full British league system operated by the Rugby Football League. The South Wales Conference and North Wales Conference are the highest tier exclusive Welsh division of the league system and are currently 5th tier in the league pyramid. Wales currently has one professional club which competes in the RFL, North Wales Crusaders.\nJunior.\nWales's junior competition is the Welsh Conference Junior League. In 2011 there was a North Wales Under 12 league. In the Conference Youth League there were two Welsh sides: North Wales Crusaders and CPC Bears.\nNational team.\nWales participated in the first ever rugby league international when they beat New Zealand 9-8 in Aberdare in 1908.\nThe national side, nicknamed the \"Dragons\", have often been one of the stronger sides in international rugby league and have also provided a number of players for the Great Britain team.

        "text": "Rugby league () is a team sport played in Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.\nHistory.\n\"First appearances in Ireland\" \nIn May 1934 Wigan beat Warrington 32–19 in an exhibition match in Dublin. Twenty years later, in May 1954, Warrington were again defeated by Halifax in both Belfast (34–15) and Dublin (23–11).\n\"First clubs and Modern Beginnings\"\nModern-day Rugby league in Ireland really began in 1989 when Brian Corrigan founded the Dublin Blues Rugby League, consisting mostly of rugby union players who wanted to stay fit over the summer. The Blues competed against touring teams from Britain, scoring a number of victories over British amateur opposition.\nIn early 1995, the British Rugby Football League development arm financed the position of a Development Officer for Ireland, providing a boost to the development of the game. \nA student's framework was also established with teams representing Ireland at the Student's Rugby League World Cup in Australia in 1992 and the UK in 1996 comprising Ireland based and UK based players. In 1996 the tournament was based in Warrington, England and several members of the Irish national champion Dublin Blues represented the Ireland Student Team against USA, Western Samoa, New Zealand, Japan and Wales. These included Phelim Comerford, Gavin Lee,Gavin Gordon Robert McDonnell, Paul Ryan, Damien Murphy, Dara MacCarthy (Top Try Scorer 1996/97) and Sean Cleary. \nIn 1995 Ireland formed its first competitive team to play against the USA in Washington DC on St. Patrick's Day. Ireland won 24–22.\nIn 1996, the inaugural Ireland \"State of Origin\" series was established between Northern Ireland and the Republic where representatives of the club teams engaged in the All-Ireland competition played for each region over a 3 match competition. The inaugural winner was the Southern team. Some of the players involved in the State of Origin series from both regions over the next few years included some of the original players with Rugby League in Ireland: Eric Doyle, Phelim Comerford, Rickey Smith, Innes Gray, Brian Carney, Sean Cleary, Gavin Gordon, Conor O'Sullivan, Garret Molloy, Mick Molloy, Alan Cuffe, Rody Corrigan, Phelim Dolan, Dan McCartney, Mark Cashen and Mick Browne.\nCompetitive matches were established between teams in Leinster and Ulster: Schoolboy matches were played between Dublin and Belfast schools, Open Age Clubs competed against each other in the All-Ireland Challenge Cup. Teams included Belfast Wildcats and Bangor Vikings from Ulster. From Leinster there were Dublin-based Dublin Blues, North Side Saints, Tallaght Tigers, Churchtown Warriors, Seapoint Sharks and Bray-based East Coast Panthers. From Munster the Cork Bulls were formed. Northside Saints and Cork Bulls had a number of successes, but the long-established Dublin Blues were always pre-eminent and there or thereabouts when it came to the trophy presentations.\nThe modern-day Rugby League Ireland was formed in 2001 initially in Leinster and Munster conferences, prior to this the competition was known as Ireland Rugby League, though after a season the league reverted to a national competition for two seasons before the conferences were reintroduced for 2004.\nIn 2006 the Leinster and Munster conferences were abandoned in favour of an all-Ireland league, but conference play was reintroduced for the 2007 season, this time on a north–south basis, below the Elite division.\nFor 2008 two national divisions operate, the Carnegie League and the Emerald Rugby National Conference.\nIn 2009 the Emerald National Conference has been replaced by the Emerald League run on a merit league basis.\nIn 2010 the Provincial Conferences were re-instated with the Leinster, Munster and Ulster Conferences. A total of 17 teams competed during the season.\nThe Conference Champions were Ballynahinch Rabbitohs in Ulster, Dublin City Exiles in Leinster, and Treaty City Titans in Munster.\nIn 2011 an academy was set up in Limerick where talented players would be identified to sign with Super League clubs, 4 were eventually signed across St Helens R.F.C., Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos.\nThe national team.\nThere are two Ireland national rugby league teams – Ireland and Ireland A. Ireland is the primary team which is made up of Irish players who compete in leagues across the globe whereas Ireland A is made up of players who play in the amateur Irish Elite League only. Irish players are also eligible for the Great Britain national team.\nIreland also has a strong students team who competed in the 2008 Students world cup and finished 2nd in the student's 4 nations tournament in 2009. Ireland finished 2nd again in the student's 4 nations tournament in 2023 beating Wales and Scotland in a strong showing for the team.\nGoverning body.\nIn Ireland the governing body is Rugby League Ireland (RLI).\nMedia.\nThere are two weekly rugby league newspapers in the UK Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express and League Weekly and two monthly magazines, Rugby League World and Thirteen Magazine. Most of their content covers the sport in Britain, Australia and New Zealand but Irish rugby league is also covered. These publications are usually only available by subscription in Ireland.\nInternational rugby league magazine covers all rugby league internationally and has featured Ireland's domestic season, road to the world cup and interviewed Luke Ambler.\nA rugby union publication called Emerald Rugby covers rugby league in Ireland each month.\nBBC Sport own the rights to broadcast a highlights package called the Super League Show which was first broadcast in Northern Ireland in 2008. Prior to this it had only been broadcast in the North of England. Rugby League Raw is not broadcast in Northern Ireland despite the BBC owning the rights to do so. The BBC covers the Rugby League Challenge Cup from the rounds in which the top clubs enter.\nBBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra carry commentary from a selection of Super League matches each week.\nLive Super League and National Rugby League games are shown on Sky Sports Arena with highlights also being shown on the channel. From the 2022 season, 10 live Super League games per season will be shown on Channel 4, the first time the league will be shown on terrestrial television. Championship games are shown on Premier Sports, with one game a week being aird.\nSetanta Sports Ireland broadcast highlights of the 2005 and 2006 pre-season Dublin challenge matches, and the 2005 European Nations Cup, on its Sports Weekly and Sports Monthly programmes.\nManchester based Channel M show some National League and amateur rugby on their Code XIII programme.\nChallenge Cup heritage.\nSince its formation in 1997, winners of the Irish Elite League have been eligible to play in the Rugby Football League's Challenge Cup.

        "title": "Rugby league in France",
        "text": "Rugby league has been played in France since 1934. As with rugby union, rugby league was introduced by the English and the heartland of the game is in the south of France.\nDuring the Second World War, in association with the French Rugby Federation (FFR), the sport was banned by the Vichy government, an act from which the code has struggled to recover. There has been a recent resurgence of the sport following the admission of Catalans Dragons and Toulouse Olympique to the professional RFL system, with Catalans a mainstay in the Super League who most recently made the Grand Final in 2023.\nIn 2012, there were approximately 30,000 active participants.\nHistory.\nIntroduction of the sport to WWII.\nRugby football was introduced into France by the British in the early 1870s. It began to flourish quickly in the poorer, more rural south. The French rugby clubs remained aligned with the Home Nation unions when rugby split into Rugby Union and Northern Union (later renamed Rugby League) in 1895.\nAllegations of professionalism and on-field violence in internationals led to France's suspension from the rugby union Five Nations Championship in 1931. Following development work by both Harry Sunderland (on behalf of the Australian Rugby League) and the British Rugby Football League, the Australian and British Test teams played an exhibition game at Stade Pershing in Paris in late December 1933. An earlier exhibition match between the two teams had been attempted to be played in Paris during the 1921-22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, but this had been blocked by the FFR. Then in 1934, Jean Galia took a French team that had never played rugby league to Yorkshire and Lancashire in England. The French Rugby League was formed on 6 April 1934.\nWith France's continued suspension from the Five Nations Championship preventing its players from participating in quality international competition, many began to consider the newly introduced 13-man code. With rugby league's acceptance of professionalism and spectator-friendly rules, the French viewed it as a modern and innovative game, and it grew quickly in popularity. Within five years, the number of rugby league clubs was approaching the number of rugby union clubs. By 1939, the French league had 225 clubs and the national side beat England and Wales to take the 1938-39 European Championship, their first. In the same year, three leading rugby union clubs – Narbonne, Carcassonne and Brive – switched to rugby league.\nThe invasion of France by Germany in May 1940 divided the country into Occupied France in the north and a southern pro-Nazi Vichy France, the latter of which roughly corresponded to the rugby-playing heartlands. The Vichy Government under Philippe Pétain associated rugby league with the pre-war socialist government, the United Kingdom and General Charles de Gaulle. Some of the French Rugby Union's senior administrators took advantage of their close relationship with the new regime to have rugby league outlawed as a \"corrupter\" of French youth. All funds as well as grounds and equipment belonging to the French Rugby League Federation were confiscated and handed over to rugby union. The figure of assets stripped has been estimated at two million 1940 French francs, none of which was ever returned. In addition, rugby league players were forced to switch to rugby union or other sports or quit sport altogether.\nThe federation was reinstated in September 1944, but the damage caused by the Vichy Government's actions proved to be long-lasting and rugby league struggled to regain its pre-war momentum.\nPost-war to the present.\nOn 10 July 1947, a \"gentleman's agreement\" was signed between the Ligue Française de rugby à treize (Paul Barrière as representative), the French republic and the French rugby union for division of the Ligue Française de rugby à treize in two parts: a Federation française de jeu à treize as the governing body of the amateur game and a Ligue de rugby à XIII as the governing body for the semi-professional game. Although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from using the word rugby in its title from 24 April 1949 until 26 June 1991, having to use the name Jeu à Treize (\"Game of Thirteen\"). Rugby league remained banned in schools and was limited to 200 professional players under this dubious arrangement.\nAfter the war the French game was re-established and the French became one of rugby league's major powers. France was the driving force behind the establishment of the Rugby League World Cup following the war. The first Rugby League World Cup was held in France in 1954; the final at Parc des Princes was narrowly lost by France 12-16 to a young, underdog Great Britain. France played major international series against Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. In 1951 and 1955, the French national team toured Australia and won both Test series 2-1; these squads are still regarded as two of the strongest sides ever to tour Australia.\nThe French maintained an excellent record in international rugby league until the 1980s, triumphing over Australia again in the home 1967-68 series and finishing as runner-up to Australia in the 1968 Rugby League World Cup. The Chanticleers also defeated Australia in the home 1978 Test series by 2 Tests to nil - a feat not repeated over Australia by another international team until the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations series win by New Zealand. Their competitiveness against Australia, Great Britain and New Zealand began to decline in the 1980s and they have yet to recover their former strength, with their last win over one of those teams being in 1990 against Great Britain.\nThe original proposal for the Super League in 1995 was for two French clubs, with both Paris and Toulouse being proposed. This was subsequently reduced to one, after much discussion among clubs. In February 1996, a French team, Paris Saint-Germain was formed to take part in the otherwise English Super League. The players being drawn from the French league. It was abandoned in October 1997, partly because Paris was not in the southern heartland of French rugby league and partly because the players had the double burden of playing for both Paris and their original club.\nIn 1998, XIII Actif were formed under the Chairmanship of French rugby league historian Robert Fassolette, to put pressure on the French government over the Vichy banning of the sport and the return of stolen assets. The French Minister of Sport commissioned an enquiry, which found in favour of XIII Actif but nothing concrete.\nThe Court then ruled that only the French rugby league federation could take action under its former name - a name it had been forced to change.\nProfessional rugby league returned to France in February 2006 when Perpignan-based club Catalans Dragons joined Super League. They provided French rugby league with a major boost by demonstrating their prowess before nearly 85,000 people at Wembley in the Final of the 2007 Rugby League Challenge Cup. In 2018 they won the RL Challenge Cup, beating Warrington Wolves 20 - 14 before a 50,672 crowd at Wembley.\nIn 2022, France were awarded hosting duties for the 2025 Rugby League World Cup. However, in 2023, they withdrew as hosts.\nGoverning body.\nSince 26 June 1991 the governing body for rugby league in France has been the Fédération Française de Rugby à XIII (i.e. formerly Ligue Française de Rugby à XIII then, Fédération Française de Jeu à XIII). The Federation is a founding member of and a full member of the Rugby League International Federation (i.e. IRLB Jan. 1948) and of the Rugby League European Federation (i.e. May 2003).\nCompetitions.\nThe French Rugby League Championship has been the major rugby league tournament for semi-professional clubs in France since the sport was introduced to the country in the 1930s. The championship is divided into several divisions; the top league being Elite One Championship, below that is the Elite Two Championship. There are several lower and regional divisions below them. The premier knock-out cup is the Lord Derby Cup and there is the Coupe Falcou for National Division One and Federal clubs.\nAt its height, the French Championship maintained teams from the big cities of Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux and Toulouse, as well as the passionate smaller rugby league towns of Carcassonne, Avignon, Lezignan, Albi, Villeneuve and Perpignan.\nFrench teams in the RFL.\nFrench teams may apply to the RFL to play in tiers one, two, or three of the British rugby league system (providing they meet certain criteria) as this is generally considered a higher standard of rugby league.\nIn addition French teams also take part in the Rugby League Challenge Cup, with Catalans Dragons (formerly known as Union Treiziste Catalan), Toulouse Olympique, Limoux Grizzlies, and Pia having done so.\nIn terms of league membership, Catalans Dragons play in the Super League, and have done so since 2006. Toulouse Olympique also bid for a Super League franchise in 2009 but were rejected. They were however accepted in the second-tier Championship, and played two mostly unsuccessful seasons in that league before returning to the French league in 2012. Toulouse Olympique later returned to the British league system, beginning play in the third-tier League 1 in 2016 and earning promotion to the Championship for 2017. The city of Toulouse maintains a presence in the French leagues through Toulouse Olympique Broncos, which have been the official reserve side for Toulouse Olympique since being taken over by that club in 2012.\nIn 2021, Catalans and Toulouse made history as both sides won the League Leaders' Shield for the Super League and Championship respectively. This marked the first time that a French side had won either division. Toulouse later went on to win the Million Pound Game, thus gaining promotion to the Super League. Toulouse were relegated in 2022.\nTeams that have played in RFL leagues are summarised below:\nPopularity.\nRugby league is most popular in the south of France. The game struggles for attention in the national media, but it is covered by regional outlets in the south. However, the introduction of Catalans Dragons into Super League in 2006 and Toulouse Olympique into RFL Championship in 2009 has seen increased coverage with articles appearing in national newspapers such as L'Équipe, Libération and Le Figaro. It has also contributed to the rise in playing numbers to the current number of approximately 30,000.\nThe Men's national team.\nLocally, the French national rugby league team are often nicknamed \"les Bleus\", after the colour of their home jersey or as \"les Tricolores\". They have competed in every World Cup and Rugby League European Cup, as well as playing in other tournaments such as the Victory Cup.\nIn 2009, it was announced that France would enter the Tri-Nations tournament as a fourth team (necessitating its renaming to the Rugby League Four Nations), playing alongside Australia, New Zealand and England. The introduction of Catalans Dragons into the Super League and recent strong performances from the international side led to this decision. Until the tournament's suspension in 2017, the winner of the Rugby League European Cup qualified as the fourth team when the competition was held in the northern hemisphere and the winner of the Pacific Cup was the fourth team when it was held in the southern hemisphere. 2009 remains the only year France has played in this tournament.\nThe French territory of New Caledonia had its own rugby league team from 2003 to 2006, which was run by the Fédération Francaise de Rugby à Treize.\nThe Women's national team.\nThe France women's national rugby league team, also known as the Chanticleers ( for the Anglophone media) or locally as Les Tricolores, represents France in Women's rugby league. They are administered by the French Rugby League Federation.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nUnlike, for instance, the BBC, France Television don't offer any program to the French public about Rugby League. This has been a real issue for the game. Explanations usually given are the low number of participants in France but also pressure which would be made by the Union authorities on the French Public Television Group.\nIn the early 2000s, Orange TV showed every Catalans Dragons home match live. Selected games from the Elite Championship were also broadcast live on Orange TV and summaries of each match Elite 1 were available to subscribers. They also broadcast some of Toulouse Olympique's home games live. Orange TV had also secured to rights to broadcast Super League, the Four Nations and the European Cup in 2009.\nIn 2010, Direct 8 gained the rights to four international matches involving France: a test match against England on 12 June and the three French games of the 2010 European Cup. This marked the first time rugby league has been shown on French free-to-air television for at least two decades.\nAfterwards, in the 2010s, Rugby League was confined to the pay television again: Beinsport has been broadcasting the NRL games and televised the Catalan Dragons Super League matches with an interruption in 2019.\nIn the early 2020s, some Elite 1 games are televised by a local channel Vià Occitanie; this is a free-to-air channel in the South of France but they are also available on the internet and via the triple play internet devices. Therefore, they offer, indirectly, a nationwide coverage of the domestic championship.\nPresently, French clubs have to fund the broadcast of their own games (e.g., Dragons Catalans) or to televise their own matches themselves via the social networks or Youtube.\nRadio.\nRadio Marseillette has rugby league debate and news every Saturday from 10:00 to 12:00. They also have exclusive live commentary of all Catalans Dragons home matches and Toulouse Olympique home matches. They also have commentary on some Elite League games.\nRadio France Bleu Roussillon carries commentary on every Catalans Dragons away match played in the UK.\nPress.\nThe French national mainstream media barely follow the game. Very occasionally, some articles about the sport are published in newspapers such as Le Monde, Le Figaro or the national Sport newspaper L'Équipe.\nNevertheless, there is undoubtedly a French specificity : the Weekly Rugby Union magazine Midi Olympique has a one-page section devoted to Rugby League. However, only two local newspapers genuinely cover the game ; L'Indépendant ( based in the South of France) and la Dépêche du Midi ( based in the South west of the country)."

        "title": "Rugby league in Greece",
        "text": "Rugby league is a team sport that is relatively new to Greece.\nHistory.\nThe Greek national team was formed in 2003 by Greek Australians. Rugby league was subsequently introduced to Greece in 2006. The first match played in Greece was contested by the Olympus Eels and Attica Tigers, with the teams consisting of a mixture of local rugby union players and Greek Australians. A few days later on 28 October 2006, Athens hosted an international match against , which Greece won 44–26.\nThe initial attempt to find a Greek RL Federation, started by Colin Mylonas, in 2003. Mylonas and his associates spent a lot of money until 2007, but they failed to form a Greek-based Federation. Colin Mylonas was involved with the continued development of the game until 2010. This included Greece playing in the 2008 University Rugby League World Cup after Russia pulled out. Greece was made up of 10 Australian based players with Greek heritage and 10 players from Greece were flown out to Australia. They achieved great success beating France in the plate Final. In the same tournament, Greece beat Scotland Ireland and came very close in beating England only losing on the bell. This put Greece on the map in playing rugby league. Other achievements included winning the Mediterranean Cup in 2010 played in Sydney beating Italy in the final, in front of 3000 people. Greece also played Fiji in Sydney in 2009 losing but gaining respect as a nation on the rise.\nColin Mylonas in 2010 had decided to withdraw from the organisation due to differences in the direction of the Greek Rugby League.\nIn 2012, Anastasios Pantazidis, Konstantinos Tzevelekos, Ioannis Mavros, Matthew Ashill and Iordanis Bilikaidis have become the first Greek coaches to gain their Level 1 qualification after completion of a two-day course in Nikaia, North of Piraeus, the port area of the capital, Athens. It was organised following co-operation between the Greek rugby league committee and the Serbian Rugby League Federation.\nThe Hellenic Federation of Rugby League (HFRL) was founded in 2013 by Anastasios \"Tasos\" Pantazidis. The body was recognised by an Athens court and was therefore accorded observer status within the RLEF in August 2013. In February 2014, the HFRL was granted affiliate member status by the RLEF.\nIn April 2016, the HFRL was suspended from the RLEF following a year-long investigation for \"wilfully acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the RLEF and international rugby league.\" The HRFL was expelled from the RLEF in August 2016 for failing to meet membership requirements. The HFRL continued to organise a domestic competition through the Hellenic Federation of Modern Pentathlon (HFMP) with the recognition of the Ministry of Culture and Sports. Meanwhile, the RLEF ran a separate, recognised competition in the 2016/17 period.\nIn March 2017, the Greek Rugby League Association (GRLA) was recognised by the RLEF as the official governing body for rugby league in Greece, and was granted observer status. The conflict between the HFRL/HFMP and the RLIF continued until August 2022 when the GRLA was finally recognised as the official body for the sport by the Greek government.\nIn December 2017, national team captain Stefanos Bastas became the first Greek domestic player to sign a professional playing contract when he secured a one-year deal with the Hemel Stags.\nGreece competed at the delayed 2021 Rugby League World Cup in which it was their first time qualifying for the tournament, they had a very hard draw coming up against host nation England , eventual runners up Samoa and France who have competed in international Rugby league for over 50 years - led by captain Billy Magoulias along with other established NRL stars lachlan Ilias and Peter Mamouzelos they performed valiantly especially against the French - with a stunning try from Greek Centre Nick Mougios on the final siren.\nAlthough the Greek side failed to win a match , they performed strongly with many semi professional players, young talent and nrl stars sprinkled in to try and help the team perform credibly. \nCompetitions.\nHFRL clubs.\nThe domestic XIII competition for 2017/18.\n9's Teams.\nhttp://www.rugbyleague.gr/omicronmualphadeltaepsilonsigma-teams.html\nPromitheas, AEKK and Pegasus, participated in a regional 2012–2013 championship of Athens.\nIn the 2013/2014 Promitheas, AEKK, Pegasus, Aris and Knights participated in the A' Division. Knights won the championship. In the B' Division, Neapoli, AEKK B', Promitheas B', Aris B' and Pegasus B' participated. Nepoli won the championship.\nFor the 2014/15 season, there were ten teams taking part:\nDivision 1: Rhodes Knights, AEK Kokkinias, Aris Petroupolis, Pyrrihios Aspropyrgou (1st team) and Pegasus Neos Kosmos. Pegasus won the championship. \nDivision 2: Neapoli Lakonias, Argos Wolves, Haidari Lions, Pyrrihios Aspropyrgou ('B' team) and Promitheas Rentis.\nFor the 2015/16 season, a new formation was planned.\nSouth Group: AEK Kokkinias, Pyrrihios Aspropyrgos and Agios Thomas. Pyrrihios won the tournament.\nNorth Group: Filippos Vereea and 2 teams from Thessaloniki. Finally, the tournament did not operate. As a result, Pyrrihios was named 2015–2016 Greece Champions.\nTwo RL 9's tournaments took place: a) in Nikaea, Piraeus (AEK Kokkinias won vs Pyrrihios and Agios Thomas) and b) in Thessaloniki (Agios Thomas won vs Lions/Kavala, Pyrrihios and Thessaloniki).\nIn 2016–2017 season, four teams participated in the XIII tournament: Pyrrichios Aspropyrgou, Aghios Thomas Goudi, A.O. Kavala and ASP Chalkidonikos http://www.rugbyleague.gr/epsilonpiiotasigmaetamuepsilonsigma-deltaiotaomicronrhogammaalphanuomegasigmaepsiloniotasigma--official-tournaments.html\nIn the 9's tournaments, five teams participated (Promitheas, Pyrrichios, St. Thomas, Nemesis, and Kavala). Pyrrichios won 2 of the cups and St. Thomas 1.\nIn 2017–2018 season, three teams participate in the XIII tournament: Pyrrichios Aspropyrgou, Promitheas Rendi and A.E.K.. http://www.rugbyleague.gr/epsilonpiiotasigmaetamuepsilonsigma-deltaiotaomicronrhogammaalphanuomegasigmaepsiloniotasigma--official-tournaments.html\nIn the 9's tournaments, five teams participate (Promitheas, Pyrrichios, A.E.K., Nemesis, Kavala. A.E.K. won 1 cup and Promitheas 1.\nAn unofficial 7's tournament was also played on 9 February 2013. Participating teams apart from Promitheas and AEK PK included the newly formed team \"Neapoli Lakonias\" that was created in Peloponnese in 2013. Promitheas won the tournament.\nNational team.\nThe first representative game involving Greece was played in 2003 against New Caledonia with Greece winning 26–10. The first representative game played in Greece was played in 2006 with Greece defeating Serbia 44–26 in Athens. These teams were not recognised by the Greek sports Authorities. In 2011 a touring GB Student \"Pioneers\" team played a game vs an unofficial \"national\" team consisting of players from the two Rhodes teams in Rhodes island. The Pioneers won. In October 2013 the Greece National Team (under the authority of the newly formatted HFRL) played an international against Hungary in Budapest. The Greek team was a mixture of local players from the fledgling Greek national competition and heritage players from Australia. Greece won the game 90–0.\nIn 2014, Greece participated in the RLEF European Championship C. Greeks won the tournament (32–18 vs Malta and 68–16 vs the Czech Rep.).\nIn 2014, Greece won the Balkan Cup in Belgrade, Serbia (58–4 vs Bosnia/Herzegovina and 50–22 vs Serbia).\nIn 2015 Greece withdrew from the RLEF European Championship C in Malta, due to financial reasons. Greeks played the home match vs Spain (lost by 4–76). That was the first Greek National team consisted only by domestic players.\nAfter the recognition of the sport by the Ministry of Culture and Sports in 2016, the Hellenic federation of Modern Pentathlon, formed a rugby league committee. As a result, the first recognised by the country's highest sport authority National Team, played twice vs Italy in L'Aquila and in Nikaea Piraeus. The opponent LIRFL is the only RL governing body recognised in Italy by the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI).\nThe Greek Men’s side made history by advancing to the final 16 of the delayed 2021 Rugby League World Cup , they had a very hard group with host nation England and eventual runners up Samoa in their pool and France who have played international rugby league for over 50 years.\nA women's national team was established in 2019 and played in the 2022 Rugby League Women's European Championship B."

        "title": "Rugby league in Italy",
        "text": "Rugby league is a team sport played in Italy.\nHistory.\nRugby league was established in Italy prior to the 1950s, during which they played a host of other European teams.\nJean Galia's efforts in the mid-1930s to persuade his fellow countrymen in France to adopt rugby league soon attracted the attention of a trainee commercial lawyer and rugby union player in Turin, Vincenzo Bertolotto. But an exhibition game suggested for Rome did not materialise.\nBut after the Second World War, discontent with the policies of the Italian rugby union in refusing to strengthen their game to put it on a level with France, led to thoughts of alternatives and the Italian Rugby League was launched in 1950 after several years of talks between then RFL secretary, Bill Fallowfield, and a group of Italian rugby union dissidents.\nThe first game in Italy, an exhibition match in Turin by two French sides, was attended by over 4,000 fans. A local resident, Dennis Chappell, once of Wakefield helped to foster the \"rebels\", among them one Vincenzo Bertolotto, then an elder statesman of Italian rugby at 38 years old.\nTogether, they organised a six-game tour to England and Wales which included a game against a \"South Wales 13\" at the Brewery Field in Bridgend, future home of Celtic Crusaders. Around 2,500 attended to see South Wales win comfortably 29-11 with Ystradgynlais' Les Lewis notching a hat-trick of tries.\nThe Italians went on to lose all of their matches but on returning home, a Turin-based side joined the French league.\nThe 1950s were a high point in international rugby league, after which a few European teams would lose interest. Despite playing host to the World Champions twice in 1960 when Australia defeated Italy 37-15 in Padua and defeated Italy again 67-22 at Treviso, by 1962 the game had died out due to pressure on players from the Italian Rugby Union threatening to ban anyone caught playing rugby league. It would be left to two pioneering Australians to get the game back up and running when international rugby league began to expand again in the late 1990s.\nIn January 1960 at the end of their 1959–60 Kangaroo Tour, the Australian national rugby league team played two internationals against an Italian representative team. The first game, played on 23 January at the Stadio Appiani in Padua in front of 3,500 curious fans, saw the Kangaroos defeat Italy 37–15. The second game played the next day at the Stadio Omobono Tenni in Treviso, saw Australia win 67–22 in front of 3,105 fans.\nItalian rugby league national team was revived in 1995 in Australia through the passion of a couple of enthusiasts by the names of Domenic (Mick) Pezzano and John Benigni. Both, were determined to have a rugby league team representing their origins compete again on the world stage, with a team formed with athletes from Australia and some from Italy. This dream was soon realised when the Italian team was invited to play in the 1995 World Sevens, which was Italy's first game since the 1960s. Pezzano coached the Italian team in the 1995 Coca-Cola World Sevens in Sydney and 1996 Super League Nines in Fiji. Other Coaches of the Italian National Team have been; David Riolo, David Penna, Craig Salvatori, Carlo Napolitano, Cameron Ciraldo and Leo Epifania.\nItaly went on to record their first win, in their first year and play many other international tournaments such as the Super League World Nines and the 1997 World Sevens to name a few. There were also a number of one-off international appearances against a Lebanese Sevens team, a Lebanese 13 a side team in a promotional match for the Mediterranean Cup and in 2004 when Italy played Greece in Sydney.\nIn 2006 the Federazione of Italia Rugby League (FIRL) was founded. The Federazione of Italia Rugby League was officially moved to the \"official observer\" status by the Rugby League European Federation from an unranked position on 15 April 2008.\nGoverning bodies.\nFederazione Italiana Rugby League (FIRL) is the governing body for rugby league in Italy and has had \"full member\" status with the Rugby League European Federation since 2017.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe Italian Rugby League Championship is an amateur rugby league competition called the r-Evolution League that began in 2010. There are three conferences, north, central and south.\nNational teams.\nThe Italy men's national team were winners of the European Championship B in 2008 and 2009. They made first World Cup appearance in 2013. The wheelchair rugby league national team made their first World Cup appearance in 2017 where they finished fourth in the tournament. The women's national team won the Mediterranean Cup in 2017, defeating Lebanon 22–0 in Jounieh."

        "text": "Rugby league is an emerging full-contact team sport in Malta. The first game played at Marsa in 2005 by a largely Australian-Maltese touring team from the East-coast of Australia. The Maltese team opened with a successful 366 victory over England Lionhearts and featured one local Maltese player, Robert Bonavia.\nHistory.\nThe Maltese Rugby League Association (MRLA) was formed in April 2004 at the Russian Club in Strathfield, Australia.\nMalta made their international debut on 25 September 2004 when they defeated British Defence Forces at Melita Stadium, Sydney, Australia.\nMalta's first rugby league international played on home soil was on Saturday October 2005 against England Lionhearts at Marsa Sports Complex, Marsa.\nThe first domestic rugby league match in Malta was on Saturday 13 October 2007 between San Giljan Dragons and Birkirkara Warriors at Floriana Stadium. (Match played in nines format).\nGoverning body.\nThe Malta Rugby League (MRL) is the official governing body of rugby league in Malta. The MRL is an Affiliate Member of the Rugby League European Federation (RLEF) and recognised by the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The MRL is also a member of the Kunsill Malti ghall-iSport (KMS) - the national organisation responsible for supporting, developing and promoting sport throughout Malta and Gozo.\nThe organisation was formed in 2008 following the merger of the now defunct Maltese Rugby League Association (formed 2004 in Australia) and the local Kumitat Nazzjonali ta Rugby League f’Malta (2006), in a move that was designed to homogenise Maltese rugby league’s structure and further its European dimension.\nFull European integration occurred in 2011 when the remaining Australian-based Directors resigned, paving the way for locals to take their place. A nine-person Board oversees MRL policy, with an operations manager from each club responsible for the day-to-day running of the sport.\nCompetitions.\nIn October 2007 the first domestic rugby league competition, the Malta Rugby League Nines, was contested with fixtures at Floriana Stadium, Floriana. Participating teams were the San Giljan Dragons, Mosta Titans, Sliema Broncos, Qormi Sharks, Birkirkara Warriors and the Siggiewi Storm along with the British Royal Logistics Corps. A Malta selection were crowned champions after defeating the Royal Logistics Corps in the final.\nBetween 2009 and 2010, the MRL Championship took place with only four games played between \"North\" and \"South\". There is also a Wheelchair rugby league championship and an MRL Academy.\nPopularity.\nThe match against England Lionhearts was partly the catalyst for continued rugby league development on the Maltese Islands and has helped set up a domestic competition within Malta.\nA crowd of approximately 750 were in attendance for the first rugby league match in Malta played at Matthew Micallef St John Athletic Stadium, Marsa.\nThe MRL's Australian links lie in the form of Maltese Heritage Rugby League that enables the foundation to promote the legacy across Australia, promoting and developing rugby league within the Maltese community. Maltese Heritage RL has teams catering for 12-year-olds through to seniors, via Academy, U16s, U18s and the Open Age Maltese Heritage RL team.\nThe national team.\nThe Malta national rugby league team is made up of local rugby league players from Malta and Heritage players from England and Australia. The team is nicknamed the \"Knights\".\nMalta XIII is a national representative team for the Republic of Malta. Players must satisfy international eligibility criteria or be a resident of Malta or Gozo. Eligible players of Malta XIII can be selected for Malta Knights."

        "text": "Rugby league is a team sport that is played in Serbia, which now has almost 1000 registered players nationwide, many of which are juniors. Belgrade and Novi Sad are the two main bases for the sport, producing most of the country's players. The most successful Serbian club side are the Dorćol Spiders who have won the most premierships. The other club Red Star Belgrade who defeated Dorćol in the deciding game to claim the minor premiership.\nHistory.\nRugby league was introduced into Serbia in 1953, by then secretary of the Yugoslavian Sport Association, Dragan Maršićević. The first rugby league match in Serbia was held in Belgrade on November 26, 1953, between French students and Selection Provence. The game was part of an attempt by the French Rugby XIII Federation to stimulate interest in the sport in Serbia.\nThe first rugby league club formed in Serbia was Partizan, on November 1, 1953, followed a couple of months later by Radnički. The two teams played their first match on April 26, 1954, with Partizan winning 21-11. In 1961, the Yugoslav national team played their first and only match against a French amateur XIII, with the team going down 13-0.\nWhile rugby league was played in Serbia, Croatia played the rival code of rugby union and Yugoslav authorities demanded that Serbian clubs switch to rugby union to unite Yugoslavia under one form of rugby football in 1964.\nRugby league officially returned to Serbia in 2001, with the formation of the Serbian Rugby League Federation at meeting held in Kruševac. Journalist Slaviša Milenković was voted in as president of the new federation. The inaugural Serbian Rugby League Championship was held on November 10, featuring teams Donji Dorćol Belgrade, Morava Belgrade, Novi Sad and Beli Orao Kruševac. Belgrade's Dorćol team won the event.\nDorćol is champion for the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 years. In late 2015 the European Rugby League federation granted Serbia a donation from their funds which in turn helped in producing at least 4 more junior clubs and having a flow on effect in other Serbian regions.\nIn 2013, Serbia helped spread the sport to the Serbian enclave of Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially Banja Luka and Doboj.\nIn October 2016 Serbia has two remaining world cup qualifiers to contest against Wales in Llanelli and against Italy in Belgrade. The match against a prestigious opponent like Wales will be the most important game Serbia has played to date.\nMajor clubs in Serbia include Dorcol Spiders and Red Star Belgrade (Crvena Zvezda).

They won Czech Republic in Prague and their captain Radoslav Novaković lifted the Slavic Cup. The Serbian team played without Serbian origin players from UK or Australia.\nOn October 28, 2006, Serbia played Greece in Athens an historic match as it was the first Rugby League match on Greek soil. Greece was at an advantage in this match, as 10 out of their 17 players were Australian-based Greeks. Although Serbia lost the match 44-26, they played well against a team that included much more experienced players. The Serbian players said it was an honour to play against Salford City Reds player Michael Korkidas. However, this did not stop the Serbian players from being as physical as possible against Korkidas. This match was watched by 250 spectators in Athens. The low crowd was due to Greek Rugby Union trying to stop the game from being played, it was not advertised.\nBelgrade hosted the first U16 European Nations Cup from 27 June to 3 July. Serbian boys made great upset by beating Russia 22-10 in the first match of their pool. In the second round, England (later winners of the Cup) won Serbia 46-0 and in 3rd place playoff Serbia lost to European Celts 22-20.

In 1993 a rural Georgian rugby union club team defected to the Russian Rugby League. The club and all of its players were banned from playing rugby union in the future.\nDespite these previous endeavours rugby league was effectively unknown in Georgia until late 2004 when a French-based rugby enthusiast Paata Tsintsadze established the Georgian National Rugby League Federation (GNRLF). In June 2004 the GNRLF was incorporated, and recognised by the State Sports Ministry. Nodar Andghuladze was the first Chief Executive Officer and David Kilassonia the coaching manager.\nTsintsadze presented to the European Federation his proposal and plans for the GNRLF after which it was agreed that the GNRLF be recognised as the governing body for the sport in Georgia. Furthermore, Georgia became active participants in the European Federation's meetings and activities from then on.\nEarly in 2005, the GNRLF team set the ambitious goal of sending the national team, which had not yet been played a game, to the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\nOn 5 September 2005 the GNRLF were told that official observer status of the GNRLF would be withdrawn with immediate effect and given to the new Georgian Rugby 13 (GR13) organisation. Despite RLEF's decision to recognize the newly founded GR13F instead of the former GNRLF as official observers of the code in Georgia, the latter showed reluctance in handing over the under 16 matters to the GR13. This ultimately meant that Georgia were unable to attend the youth world championship.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body for rugby league in Georgia was the Georgian Rugby League Federation. It was founded in 2004 by former France rugby union player, Paata Tsintsadze.\nNational team.\nThe Georgia national rugby league team represented Georgia in . The national squad was entirely from Georgian-based rugby union players. Despite there having been no domestic rugby league the team attracted relatively large crowds for international matches, in the range of 10,000 spectators. However, they were expelled from the 2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifiers for forfeiting a game in Russia, due to their players playing rugby union at the time and subsequently stopped playing the game and were expelled from the Rugby League International Federation and Rugby League European Federation."

A group of Australian-born rugby league players with Lebanese heritage, mostly from inner-city Sydney formed a team with a view to entering the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. They were accepted into the qualifying tournament on the agreement that they would aim to develop rugby league within the country they represent. They subsequently went on to win the qualifying competition, earning their place by defeating Italy and Morocco of the Mediterranean group before travelling to Florida to defeat the USA, winners of the Pacific group.\nIn 2002 a domestic league was set up in Lebanon, initially with four university-based teams. Players from the domestic competition now feature in the national team. A team composed entirely from Lebanese domestic players, known as \"Lebanon Espoirs\" has been formed.\nIn 2011, Lebanon nearly qualified for 2013 Rugby League World Cup but lost to Italy who became the 14th and final nation to qualify for the event.\nIn 2011, the government of Lebanon promised to increase its support and funding for rugby league.\nGoverning body and competitions.\nThe Lebanese Rugby League Federation is based in Safra, Lebanon.

In addition to the national team, a representative team of South Africans living in the United Kingdom was formed in 2004 called the Wild Dogs (now defunct).\nHistory.\nRugby league in South Africa has a long and turbulent history, consisting of no less than three administrations over 40 years that attempted to establish the game of rugby league in South Africa. None, certainly the earlier attempts, were very successful.\nThe first attempted expansion of the code into South Africa was primarily put together by the English and encouraged by the French for the purpose of expanding the game into new nations, that would inevitably bring more tests to the English and French shores, ensuring a lucrative future. At least, that was the plan; however it was not to be, the South African public did not take to the sport and the expansion plans were stopped prematurely causing a third scheduled match in London to not be played.\nThe second attempted expansion was a strange double act in the 1960s consisting of two separate factions, known as the National Rugby League and South African Rugby League. Each fought for their own survival until the RLIF laid down the law that saw the NRL effectively shut down and its clubs moved to the SARL. All was looking good for SARL until a South African representative team toured Australia and were embarrassingly beaten.\nIn 1991 the South African Rugby Football League was established to promote amateur rugby league.\n1998's World Club Challenge between the British and Australian champions was mooted as a showpiece fixture at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. However this didn't eventuate.\nSince 2009, several South Africans have made their mark in the Australian rugby league. Notably, Jarrod Saffy has played for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Allan Heldsinger for the Redcliffe Dolphins, and Willie Bloem for the Canberra Raiders. In 2010, the Sydney Roosters signed South African rugby union junior, JP Du Plessis. The National Rugby League (NRL) has expressed intentions to recruit more South African talent in the future.\nThe Sydney Roosters have successfully signed four South African rugby union players, a strategic move underscored by Peter O'Sullivan's commitment to personally bring them to Bondi. Similarly, the Melbourne Storm have ventured into recruiting talent from South Africa, expanding their roster with players from the rugby-rich nation. This initiative reflects the growing interest in South African athletes within the Australian rugby league scene.\nIn 2011 a host of changes were implemented by the remaining clubs, the first of which was to elect a representative board and establish a Commercial Entity to take the sport forward. The result is a new National Club Championship as well as several international tours next year. The South African Senior Side also played in the Rugby League World Cup Qualifier in 2011 and will hope to build in 2012 towards a strong showing in the 2012 and 2013 international seasons.\nThe South African Students will be competing in the Rugby League Students World Cup in July 2013 in England.\nNational Club Competitions.\nThere are currently three competitions in South Africa, the Rhino Cup, the first division, consisting of 4 teams, the Protea Cup, the second division, consisting of 8 and the Western Province Rugby League, the third division, consisting of 8 teams.\nThe competition started in 2009 with only four teams from all provinces, with the Ermelo Tomahawks winning. In 2010 and 2011, the Rhino Cup was held with the Middelburg Tigers and the TUKS Reds coming out the victors. In 2012, there was no Cups held, instead, there were derby matches on different provinces; Western Cape, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng. In 2013, the Rhino Cup was reinstated and the Protea Cup and the Western Cape Cup was added as well. The TUKS Rugby League took the Rhino and Protea Cups in the 2013-14 season."

        "text": "Rugby league football () is a participation and spectator sport in Canada.\nHistory.\nGames related to rugby football have been played in Canada since the 19th century, with the first Rugby Union being established in 1861. However, the rugby league made little headway in the country, where rugby union and later Canadian football were the dominant field sports. In 1928 the Great Britain Lions, Britain's national rugby league team, visited Canada on their way home from a tour of Australia and New Zealand. According to the Imperial Rugby League Board, a domestic competition using rugby league rules was held in Canada the following year.\nFrom the late 19th century Canadian unions adopted rule changes, generally similar to changes made in the United States, which created the sport known as Canadian football. Through the 20th century football gained in popularity, displacing other codes. With support declining, the Nova Scotia Rugby Union, which governed the sport in Nova Scotia and the Maritimes, decided to adopt the rugby league code in hopes of saving rugby from the incursion of Canadian football. The switch was first discussed in 1945, but the lack of a rule book precluded any action. The switch was finally agreed upon in 1946, and the switch was made the following season.\nWith the exception of Halifax schools, which had adopted football, all competitions in the Maritimes, – the senior level, Maritime, high school, and university competitions – made the switch to rugby league. Unlike most rugby league competitions, the NSRU continued to be recognized by the Canadian Rugby Football Union, and all players remained amateur. Though attendance and participation increased in the first year, it did not last, and football continued to increase in popularity throughout the Maritimes. The universities all switched to football by 1955, and the senior league shrank to just four teams. Rugby league continued to be played in many Nova Scotia high schools until 1959, and was still played elsewhere in the Maritimes into the 1960s, but disappeared thereafter.\nRevival.\nIn the 1980s interest in amateur rugby league returned, and in 1986 a new competition, the Tri-Counties Rugby League, was established. Four teams competed in its first year, three from Canada, and one from the U.S., the New York-based Adirondacks club. Later, the Canada national rugby league team was formed, and participated semi-regularly in international competition from 1987–2000. The team competed in the 2000 Emerging Nations Tournament, but afterward went dormant as the governing body folded. Thereafter Canada's rugby league participation dwindled, though there were two regional rugby league nines tournaments as recently as 2003, one in Ontario and one in Manitoba.\nIn 2010, a new organization, Canada Rugby League, was formed with the intention of reviving the national team and building a new domestic competition. Under the CRL the national team played international games several times in 2010, including the American National Rugby League's annual \"War at the Shore\" event, hosting the Colonial Cup, and competing in the Rugby League Atlantic Cup in Jacksonville, Florida. Two domestic teams, the Toronto City Saints and the St. Catharines Bobcats, were established, and are set to be joined by two new teams in 2011. Super League teams St Helens R.F.C. and Salford City Reds have also formed partnerships with Canadian rugby league, and \"Rugby League Review\", one of the leading rugby league magazines around the world came on board as a sponsor of Canadian rugby league. Setanta Sports will broadcast rugby league matches in Canada. Canada won its first international match of the revival era on July 31, 2011 defeating Jamaica 40-10 in Markham, Ontario.\nIn 2016, the 2025 Rugby League World Cup was jointly awarded to Canada and the United States, however both later withdrew.\nIn 2017, Toronto Wolfpack was formed as an expansion club of the British rugby league system, and competed for four seasons until the COVID-19 pandemic, entering the league system in League 1 and seeing two promotions in three years to finish in the Super League.\nPost-covid, the Wolfpack formed their own competition within North America after the failed North American Rugby League.\nClub competition.\nThere are currently three (known) provisional competitions in Canada, the Ontario Rugby League Competition, the British Columbia Rugby League Competition, and the Alberta Rugby League Competition, all are amateur.\nCanada attempted to launch the professional North American Rugby League along with the USA in 2021, however this never materialised. In 2023, Toronto Wolfpack, Canada's only professional club (who previously had completed in the British rugby league system) organised the Canada Cup, an international league for all of North America."

        "text": "Rugby league is a team sport which is growing in popularity in the West Indies.\nPopularity.\nParticipation.\nRugby league participation in the Caribbean has only been possible as recently as 2005, with the introduction of the JRLA National Preimership. Despite the sports early beginnings, it has proved to be a large success, surpassing the most optimistic hopes of the games administrators.\nThe sport is most popular among young male adults. Currently, Jamaica is the only country to have a competition and enough interest to sustain future events. However, there are plans to bring similar competitions to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.\nCurrent Trends.\nPlans to run the first Caribbean rugby league competition had to be brought forward 12 months in 2005 because of the large amounts of interest shown in the sport. The sport in Jamaica is making good in roads which consists of 5 teams split into two divisions in the National Premiership.\nThe National Team.\nThe West Indies rugby league team (nicknamed \"The Wahoos\") represents the Caribbean and the West Indies region in the sport of rugby league.\nHistory.\nThe West Indies were first introduced to Rugby League with the formation of the West Indies Rugby League Federation in 2003. One of the first things the WIRLF did was to find and invite league players from England who had a Caribbean background to join the West Indies team in future representative competitions.\nThe first games to be played by the West Indies team was the Middlesex Nines in 2004. Later in 2004 and 2005 they would also compete in the York Nines competition. The first thirteen-a-side game the West Indies played was against the South African Wild Dogs in London, September 24, 2004.\nDuring 2005 the first local rugby league competition in the Caribbean took place in Jamaica, which is being hailed as a huge success for the WIRLF. The competition consists of the Vauxhall Vultures, Duhaney Park Sharks, Olympic Angels and the Jamaica Defence Force Warriors.\nJamaica Rugby League Association National Premiership.\nThe JRLA National Premiership currently (2006) consists of five teams:\nEach team currently has a team playing in the Open Division competition.\nAll the teams (Sharks, Angels, Warriors, Knights and Vultures) are based within the nation's capital of Kingston. There are many players who are from adjoining parishes such as St Catherine and St Andrew. For further information visit Jamaica Rugby League Association"

        "title": "Rugby league in the United States",
        "text": "While rugby league has been played in the United States since 1954, with Australia and New Zealand playing games there on their return from the Rugby League World Cup in France, serious attempts to start the sport in the United States began only in the late 1970s. The establishment of a national team and a domestic competition in the late 20th century has seen more recent progress.\nThe United States national rugby league team has participated in international competition since 1987. In 1998, the country's first domestic competition, the AMNRL, was launched as a semi-professional league, predominantly based in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, and affiliated to the Rugby League International Federation, the sport's world governing body. In 2011, a new domestic competition, the USARL, began.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGames related to rugby football (now rugby union) were played in the United States in the early 19th century. During this time the sports had no fixed rules, and were particularly popular in universities and college preparatory schools in the Northeastern United States. The sport of American football evolved from these intercollegiate games.\nMeanwhile, in Huddersfield, England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favored strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. Many Northern English industrial towns tended to be poorer, the working class players often working in industries that had long hours of manual labour for which they would not get paid for time off. Amateur status for players in these towns was therefore not just financially difficult, but also physically demanding due to the nature of their work. In 1895 this resulted in the formation of a break-away professional sport, rugby league, the rules of the two codes of rugby (union and league) would themselves diverge. The bulk of the clubs conforming to the new sport consisted of Northern English towns. Whilst the new form of rugby was taken to countries such as New Zealand, Australia, and France, American rugby continued to be played solely under rugby union rules. The sport was eclipsed by American football and was confined to California by the time of the 1920 Olympics.\nIn 1939, the Californian Rugby Football Union wrote to the governing body of rugby league, the Rugby Football League, to tell them they wanted to switch from rugby union and affiliate to the RFL. In June 1939, the RFL made plans to send a delegation out to California but were unable to do so due to the outbreak of World War II.\n1950s and 60s: Introduction.\nOne of the earliest attempts to introduce rugby league to the United States was in 1953, when Mike Dimitro, a wrestling promoter and former UCLA football all star and NFL Rams player (1947 draft), was asked to organize a tour of Australasia by an American rugby league side. The team was given a huge schedule that included 26 matches against Australian and New Zealand sides. None of the 22 American players had ever played rugby league prior to the tour, and they presented themselves in American football-like attire early on in the tournament. The side won only six games as well as drawing two.\nTheir second match of the tour, against a Sydney side, drew a crowd of 65,453 to the Sydney Cricket Ground. After a consistent lack of competition, crowds were good but never reached the same heights. In turn, the tour did not bring any benefits to American rugby league, but Mike Dimitro did not give up, he was able to organize two exhibitions against Australia and New Zealand in California that did not turn out to be a big success. An American side also made a short tour of France in early 1954, including a match against the France national team in Paris. France beat the United States 31–0.\nMike Dimitro was still optimistic of developing the game in the United States, but his bid to host a Rugby League World Cup in the 1960s failed.\n1970s to 90s: Attempts to organize the sport.\nIn the 1970s former American football player Mike Mayer founded the United States Rugby League with the intention of forming the country's first professional rugby league competition. Between 1976 and 1978, Mayer secured franchising rights from the British Rugby Football League and attempted to attract funding from British and Australian promoters to help establish a twelve-team professional competition. The proposed league would have chiefly relied on attracting American football players who could not make it in the National Football League. However, Mayer was unable to find sufficient financial backing, and the league never got off the ground.\nIn the 1980s interest in amateur rugby league began to grow. In 1986 a new competition, the Tri-Counties Rugby League, was established with three teams in Canada and one from the United States, the New York state-based Adirondacks club. In 1987 the Australian state teams of Queensland and New South Wales played a fourth exhibition match following the three 1987 State of Origin series matches in Long Beach, California. The result of this match was not to be included in official statistics, but in recent years the New South Wales Rugby League and media organizations based in that state have added the win to their tally. Promoters claimed the match drew 10,000 spectators, but detractors said it drew only about 7,000 and was not a financial success.\nMeanwhile, Mayer had continued to promote rugby league. His efforts resulted in establishing a national team to play a match against Canada in 1987; this would be the U.S.' first international match since the 1950s. The following year he was involved in promoting an exhibition game between the English teams the Wigan Warriors and the Warrington Wolves at County Stadium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wigan defeated Warrington 12–5, in front of a crowd of 17,773.\nIn 1991 \"Rugby World\" TV promoter John F. Morgan of Lake Placid, NY was petitioned by Rugby League Australia to bring a U.S. team to the Sydney 7s and in 1993 Morgan created the American Patriots who became a novel hit at the event. Morgan also acquired the TV rights to ARL competitions and aired them on his \"Rugby World\" TV program from 1991 to 1995. He also attempted to launch League in the U.S. and convinced the RFL to send an Ireland Team to the U.S. for St. Patrick's Day matches in 1995 and 1996. The games were staged at RFK Stadium and televised live by ESPN2 in 1995 and delayed in 1996. In 1992 former St George Dragons player David Niu moved to Philadelphia and began to introduce rugby league to the Glen Mills Schools, where he was employed as a teacher. Soon after, he was contacted by Morgan and they set about building a U.S. national team with Niu as player coach to compete in international tournaments for the first time. Morgan also hosted a few U.S.-Canada matches and a U.S.-Russia match at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco in 1996. Niu took over for Morgan after the 96 season. Under Niu's leadership the United States competed in the Super League World Nines (1996, 1997), Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament (2000 and Victory Cup (2003, 2004) competitions.\n1997–2011: Formation of Super League America, the country's first governing body.\nIn the mid-1990s, rugby league promoters including Australian-American Niu worked to promote the game domestically, and in 1997 the first rugby league organizing body, Super League America (later renamed America National Rugby League (AMNRL)), was formed, with Niu as its head. Super League America was recognized as the official governing body for the sport by the Rugby League International Federation, and was in charge of organizing the national team and establishing a domestic competition. The domestic competition kicked off in 1998 and was contested by six team; the Glen Mills Bulls (later the Aston Bulls), the New Jersey Sharks (later the Bucks County Sharks), the New York Broncos (later the New York Knights), the Philadelphia Bulldogs (now the Philadelphia Fight), the Boston Storm, and the Pennsylvania Raiders, with Glen Mills winning the inaugural championship. Boston and Pennsylvania later dropped out of the league, while the remaining four teams continued to play under the guidance of Super League America. In 2000, Super League America announced a reorganization; the league headquarters were moved to Jacksonville, Florida, with Jacksonville-based marketing executive Steve Gormley serving as the organization's new president. Niu would serve as CEO and maintain the northeastern branch in Philadelphia. The organization was renamed the United States Rugby League, and set its sights on expanding into the Southeastern United States and attracting British rugby league teams to Florida for training camps and international competitions. The USRL was successful in entering the U.S. national team into the Rugby League World Cup qualification process for the first time, as they participated unsuccessfully in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup qualifying tournament. However, a dispute involving the British Rugby Football League led to financial difficulties and internal strife within the USRL.\nFlorida has hosted rugby league games in the past, the state was the host to 1999 North Pacific Qualification Tournament, where the U.S. beat both Japan and Canada to meet Lebanon for the right to play in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Orlando's ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex hosted the Tomahawks's test against England, for the latter's 2000 World Cup warm up game. It ended 110–0 to the away team. In 2001, Florida was also host to the Sunshine State Challenge, where the United States competed against Huddersfield, Halifax and Leeds, the miniature tournament drew a crowd of 6,700.\nIn 2005, an exhibition match was played in Phoenix, Arizona, to help promote rugby league outside the heartland. Plans were announced to start a west coast competition called the WAMNRL in Summer 2011.\nIn 2006, a new team joined the AMNRL from Boston, which played an exhibition match in 2005. Teams from New Haven (Connecticut) and Jacksonville (Florida) also joined the 2006 competition. A Chicago team is also going through various stages of development with possible inclusion in the USARL in the future.\n2006 saw further expansion as the league added a first Southern club in Jacksonville Axemen, while further Northeastern clubs were added in New Haven Warriors, and the Boston Braves. The Fairfax Eagles joined the competition in 2007, and the Boston Thirteens joined in 2009. Another founder member, the Bucks County Sharks, suspended operations in 2010, while the Pittsburgh Vipers were added.\nIn 2009, a new professional rugby league competition, the National Rugby League USA (NRLUS), was announced. The new league was to include administrators and talent from the AMNRL, and was intended to begin play in 2010. However, the league had not gotten off the ground, and officials announced their hopes that play would begin in 2011, citing the late 2000s recession as a factor in the league's lack of progress.\nIn November 2010 the U.S. announced a strategic plan to grow the sport in the country with grass roots development, expansion and world cup qualification in sight.\n2011–14: USARL schism.\nThe start of 2011 saw a schism in American rugby league, with seven sides leaving the AMNRL to form a new competition, the USA Rugby League. The departing clubs cited a lack of club input and stability in the administration of the AMNRL as the main reason for forming the new competition. The departing clubs were New Haven Warriors, Jacksonville Axemen, Philadelphia Fight, Boston Thirteens, Pittsburgh Sledgehammers, Washington DC Slayers and Fairfax Eagles. The New Jersey Turnpike Titans and Rhode Island Rebellion were new teams that came into being as a result of the USA Rugby League's formation and served as founding clubs to the new competition.\nIn retribution, the AMNRL used its position as the RLIF sanctioned U.S. body to overlook any USARL affiliated players from selection for U.S. national representative football. This enticed several players to abandon their local USARL club in the hope of representing the national team, such as Apple Pope.\n2011 saw the creation of the American Youth Rugby League Association. The sole concern of AYRLA is introducing the sport to American youth. Since 2011, the American Youth Rugby League Association has created and administered summer camps and clinics in addition to a Middle School Flag Competition, A U23 Tackle Competition, A Training School Program (youth prison), a U23 Representative Side dubbed the 'AYRLA Americans', and a High School Competition. Also AYRLA has created coaching courses that are geared for Americans and American youth. The American Youth Rugby League Association is responsible for the first American in history to be brought through a rugby league youth development program to play for a first grade side.\nIn 2012, the AMNRL reached a partnership agreement with Grand Prix Rugby to broadcast and finance the sport within the United States, in the lead up to the 2013 Rugby League World Cup.\n2014–present: AMNRL collapse and USARL control.\nDuring this period, the USARL looked to consolidate its domestic competition while the AMNRL struggled domestically, with only New York Knights and Connecticut Wildcats maintaining regular competition under the AMNRL banner. In 2014, the USARL announced the formation of a Southern conference, with the Atlanta Rhinos and Central Florida Warriors among participating teams, while the Brooklyn Kings joined the Northeastern conference. Meanwhile, the AMNRL competition failed to materialize in 2014 and, following the end of David Niu's long association with the sport, the AMNRL ceded their RLIF membership and folded as an organization, with the USARL being accepted as the sole governing body for the sport in November 2014 and the few remaining AMNRL teams being accepted into the USARL competition.\nIn 2016, the U.S. was awarded the 2025 Rugby League World Cup along with co-host, neighbors Canada. However, plans for the World Cup to be held in the U.S. and Canada were scrapped on December 4, 2018, due to financial concerns and that the location of the 2025 Rugby League World Cup would be determined by a new bidding process in 2019.\nCurrent expansion franchises as of the 2020s include the Chicago Stockyarders and Cleveland Rugby League. The USARL as of 2021 plans to expand in all formats of the game such as Wheelchair rugby league, Masters Rugby League and Women's rugby league.\nIn 2021, a break-away competition was form, the North American Rugby League (NARL). However, to date, only one match of the competition was ever played.\nIn 2022, The Commission for Rugby League in the United States (USARLC) was established and claimed that it had the agreement of the International Rugby League (IRL) to become the governing body for rugby league in the United States. The IRL issued a statement refuting the claim made by USARLC stating that they (IRL) had had no contact with USARLC and that USARL remains the sole IRL member in the United States.\nAustralia's National Rugby League competition will commence its 2024 season with a double-header at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the Sydney Roosters to face the Brisbane Broncos, and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to take on the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\nNational competitions.\nAMNRL (1997–2014).\nTracing its origins to 1997, the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) was the United States' oldest rugby league competition. Eleven teams competed in the 2010 AMNRL season, with seven departing after the season to form the USA Rugby League, currently the only domestic rugby league competition in the United States.\nBefore the split and decline of the AMNRL, it had announced various plans for expansion. The Chicago Stockyarders team had announced it would be embarking on a full exhibition schedule for 2011, and had future plans to join the AMNRL. The AMNRL had also planned a four- to six-team competition for Hawaii in partnership with the Hawaii Rugby League; teams in the development were Kona, Maui, Harlequins, Spears, Islanders, and University of Hawaii. On June 10, 2011, the Utah Avalanche of Salt Lake City, Utah, announced they were joining the AMNRL as a developing team. To date, they have not yet aligned with the new USA Rugby League Other plans for a Western American National Rugby League and development in other areas had been announced at various times.\nUSARL (2011–present).\nThe USA Rugby League was announced on January 12, 2011. It was formed by seven teams formerly in the AMNRL, and became a competitor m and competition to the AMNRL. It held its inaugural season during the Summer of 2011, and in 2014 became the sole competition in the US following AMRL's collapse.\nRegional competitions.\nLonestar Rugby League.\nThe Lonestar Rugby League (LRL) is a four team rugby league competition planned in Texas.\nMidwest Rugby League.\nThe Midwest Rugby League (MWRL) is a rugby league long discussed competition in the Midwest United States. In 2009 an organization named Midwest Rugby League was formed to promote rugby league in the Midwestern United States, and to operate the Stockyarders team from 2010 onwards. There has been significant difficulty establishing clubs close enough to Chicago to operate regular matches.\nUnsanctioned competitions.\nNorth American Rugby League.\nThe North American Rugby League (NARL) is an unsanctioned rugby league club competition in North America. At launch, the league announced fourteen teams; twelve from United States and two from Canada. An inaugural season was planned for 2021 but was deferred until 2022 due to increased health and safety needs regarding COVID-19 and insurance and travel costs. The league will now launch with six foundation teams, five from the United States and former professional Super League member club Toronto Wolfpack from Canada. The first season was supposed to kick off on May 21, 2022, but failed to do so. A pre-season game was played in June and an announced start for September for the competition with even more reduced sides. This also failed to start.\nChampionship Rugby League.\nThe Championship Rugby League (CRL) was introduced in December 2022. It was not affiliated with USARL. It began play in December 2022 and played through April 2023. It ceased operations at that point.\nRugby League United.\nFounded in February 2023, Rugby League United is based in the Northeastern United States. It is not affiliated with USARL DC Cavalry won its championship in August 2023.\nParticipation.\nAccording to estimates in 2022, there were 700 rugby league players in the United States.\nYouth rugby league.\nIn 2011 The American Youth Rugby League Association was formed as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization. The goals of the American Youth Rugby League Association otherwise known as AYRLA are dedicated to introducing the sport to youth throughout the United States. AYRLA has formed a partnership with Rugby League Clubs in the U.S. most Notably the Rhode Island Rebellion and the Philadelphia Fight, in efforts to launch youth competitions and clinics in schools and towns, utilizing players coaches and administrators of local club's to run the day to day programs.\nThe American Youth Rugby League Association have created Middle School, U23 and High School Competitions. Additionally AYRLA has created and assist run summer camps and clinics. For a history look here "

Founded in 1945, and folded in 1992 (1991–92 Winer Broker YUBA League), it was run by the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia. With a total of 16 European-wide trophy winners and 11 finalists, the Yugoslav First Basketball League was one of the strongest European national domestic basketball leagues of all time.\nAlthough each of the former Yugoslav countries now have their own national domestic leagues, the six nations also now take part in the ABA League (commonly known as the Adriatic League), which was founded in 2001; and which is, the closest basketball league in existence today, that is similar to the former Yugoslav First Federal Basketball League.\nHistory.\nAfter the end of Second World War in Yugoslavia in 1945, there arose a need for athletic development in the fledgling nation. Post-WW2 Yugoslavia was (with the exception of major cities such as Belgrade, Ljubljana, Zagreb, and Sarajevo) for the most part lacking in competitive opportunities in sports. In response to this, 1945 and 1946 saw an explosion of new clubs and leagues for every sport, the basketball league being part of this phenomenon.\nThe very first competition under the newly formed Yugoslav Basketball League in 1945, drawing parallel to the Yugoslav First League (of football), was more or less a nationwide affirmation of unity. Instead of individual clubs competing in the usual fashion, there were only eight teams. Six representing each state within Yugoslavia, one representing the province of Vojvodina, and the last representing the Yugoslav People's Army.\nOnly in the 1970s did the basketball culture of Yugoslavia truly come to enjoy recognition as the top nation in basketball. Breaking away from the dominance of the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav league gave rise to stars that would go on to win multiple Basketball World Championships and European Basketball Championships. After a decade of dominance, the 1980s saw a disappointing slump of talent in the Yugoslav Basketball League.\nOnce again the world witnessed a sleeping giant come awake in the early 90s as Yugoslavia won two straight European Basketball Championships and a World Basketball Championship. This momentum was swiftly halted by the ethnic strife which broke out in 1991. Clubs from SR Slovenia and SR Croatia withdrew from the league so that the 1991–92 season, the competition's last, was contested without them. The country got divided into five successor republics, each founding their own basketball federations with the exception of Serbia and Montenegro, which retained the name Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the YUBA League.\nDespite all these changes, the joint league of clubs from the former Yugoslavia proved to be a winning league format formula, so on 3 July 2001, the Adriatic League was founded. It features teams from all the former Yugoslav states, and it exists alongside scaled-down versions of the individual national domestic leagues of each of the former Yugoslav states.\nPlayoff finals.\nPlayoffs, as a way of determining the Yugoslav First Basketball League champion following the regular season, got instituted in 1981 ahead of the 1981–82 season.\nSource: official website archive"

Before the round of 23 August, the two teams were tied on 10 points, with one match left to play and all other teams out of contention. Yorkshire travelled to Taunton to play Somerset and, after the first day was rained off, Somerset had to bat on a rain-affected pitch.

        "text": "Jim Sullivan (2 December 1903 – 14 September 1977) was a Welsh rugby league player, and coach. Sullivan joined Wigan in June 1921 after starting his career in rugby union. A right-footed toe-end style (rather than round the corner style) goal-kicking , he scored 4,883 points in a career that spanned 25 years with Wigan, and still holds several records with the club today.\nHe made a combined total of 60 appearances at representative level with England, Wales, Great Britain and Other Nationalities, and his 26 appearances with Wales was still a record for many years after his death. He also represented Wales in British baseball. Sullivan went on to have the rare distinction of playing all three codes of baseball played in Britain the inter-war years. He played both Welsh and English baseball before the two codes were unified in 1927 and continued playing baseball in the latter 20s and 30s, primarily for the Everton and St Margarets baseball clubs in Liverpool. In the mid-1930 he also played American baseball for Manchester Blue Sox and Greenfield Giants.\nEarly life.\nSullivan was born at Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales. He attended St Alban's School, and joined his hometown rugby union team Cardiff at the age of 16. He made his début against Neath in October 1920, and went on to make 38 appearances for the club. In December 1920, 26-days after his seventeenth birthday, he played for the Barbarians in a match against Newport, becoming the youngest player to represent the team. His performances attracted the attention of several rugby league clubs, including Wakefield Trinity, Hull FC, Huddersfield and Wigan. While playing for Cardiff, Sullivan served an apprenticeship to become a boilermaker. He was also a British baseball player, and appeared for Wales in a match against England in 1921.\nRugby league career.\nIn June 1921, Sullivan turned professional and joined rugby league side Wigan, reportedly signing a 12-year contract for a fee of £750. He made his début in August 1921, converting five goals in a 21–0 victory over Widnes. He made his first representative appearance in December 1921, playing for Wales in a 16–21 defeat against Australia.\nJim Sullivan played , and scored 4-conversions in Wigan's 13-2 victory over Oldham in the Championship Final during the 1921–22 season at The Cliff, Broughton on Saturday 6 May 1922, played , and scored 4-conversions in the 22-10 victory over Warrington in the Championship Final during the 1925–26 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Saturday 8 May 1926. played , and scored 2-conversions, and a drop goal in Wigan's 15–3 victory over Salford in the Championship Final during the 1933–34 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 28 April 1934, and played in the 12–5 victory over Dewsbury in the Championship Final second-leg during the 1943–44 season at Crown Flatt, Dewsbury on Saturday 20 May 1944 (Joe Jones having played in the first-leg).\nJim Sullivan played , and scored 4 conversions in Wigan's 20–2 victory over Leigh in the 1922–23 Lancashire Cup Final at the Willows in Weaste, Salford on Saturday 25 November 1922, played , and scored a conversion in the 11–15 defeat by Swinton in the 1925–26 Lancashire Cup Final at The Cliff, Broughton on Wednesday 9 December 1925, played , and scored a conversion in the 2–5 defeat by Swinton in the 1927–28 Lancashire Cup Final at Watersheddings, Oldham on Saturday 19 November 1927, played , and scored a conversion in the 5–4 victory over Widnes in the 1928–29 Lancashire Cup Final the Willows, Salford, on Saturday 24 November 1928, played , and scored 2-conversions in the 12–21 defeat by Salford in the 1934–35 Lancashire Cup Final at Station Road, Swinton, on Saturday 20 October 1934, played , and scored 2-conversions in the 7–15 defeat by Salford in the 1935–36 Lancashire Cup Final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 19 October 1935, played , and scored a conversion in the 2–5 defeat by Salford in the 1936–37 Lancashire Cup Final at Wilderspool, Warrington on Saturday 17 October 1936, and played and scored 5-conversions in the 10–7 victory over Salford in the 1938–39 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1938–39 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 22 October 1938.\nOn 14 February 1925, he landed 22 goals against amateurs Flimby &amp; Fothergill in the Challenge Cup, which is still a record. He toured with the Great Britain Lions three times (1924, 1928 and 1932) and was captain on the last occasion. He top-scored on all three tours. He refused what would have been a record fourth trip, in 1936, for personal reasons.\nFor twenty years, he dominated at , representing Great Britain (28 times), Wales (26), Other Nationalities (6), British Empire (1), Glamorgan (1) and Glamorgan and Monmouthshire (12). He was Wales' most capped player for over 70 years before his record was surpassed by Ian Watson in 2010. During the Second World War, he played infrequently for Wigan, as he chose to appear as a guest for a number of other clubs, including Dewsbury, Keighley and Bradford Northern. His last season before retiring was in 1945–46 – the season when the peacetime league resumed – and played his last game against Batley in February 1946.\nWhen he removed his Wigan jersey for the last time, he had made 774 appearances and amassed 2,317 goals and 4,883 points for the club. These figures are still unchallenged. He scored a club record of 161 goals in 1934-35 and a record total of 204 goals in 1933-34 (including representative games). He had won three league Championships, two Challenge Cups and three Lancashire Cups.\nAppearance record.\nSullivan holds the world record for the most first team appearances in the sport of Rugby League. In his 25 year career, Sullivan made 928 first team appearances, a figure unmatched anywhere in the world.\nCoaching career.\nHaving been captain-coach at Wigan since 1932, Sullivan continued managing the team after retiring as a player in 1946, creating one of the club's greatest sides by winning a record five championships and a brace of Challenge Cups.\nSullivan was the coach in Wigan's 8-3 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1948–49 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 1 May 1948, in front of a crowd of 91,465.\nIn 1952 he joined St. Helens, overseeing their rise. Sullivan was the coach in St. Helens' 10–15 defeat by Huddersfield in the 1952-53 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 25 April 1953, in front of a crowd of 89,588, and was the coach in the 13-2 victory over Halifax in the 1955 -56 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 28 April 1956, in front of a crowd of 79,341.\nSullivan was the coach in St. Helens' 44–22 victory over Hunslet in the Championship Final during the 1958–59 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 16 May 1959.\nHe later returned to Wigan as coach in 1961, but left months later due to ill health.\nJim Sullivan died in his home town of Cardiff on 1 November 1977 at the age of 73. He was one of the inaugural inductees of the British Rugby League Hall of Fame in October 1988. He is also an inductee of the Wigan Hall of Fame, and the St Helens Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Winged Foot Golf Club",
        "text": "Winged Foot Golf Club is a private golf club in the northeastern United States, located in Mamaroneck, New York, a suburb northeast of New York City. The club was founded in 1921, by a group largely made up of members of The New York Athletic Club, and opened in June 1923. Winged Foot's name and logo are taken directly from a sculpture in the lobby floor of the New York Athletic Club in Manhattan.\nWinged Foot has two 18-hole golf courses, the West and the East, both of which were designed by A. W. Tillinghast. The West Course is a par 72 that measures ; it has a course rating of 76.4 and a slope of 140. The East Course is a par 72 that measures ; it has a course rating of 73.6 and a slope of 140. \"Golf Digest\"' ranked the West Course 8th and the East Course 65th in its 2009-10 listing of \"America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses\".\nIn 2019 Winged Foot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the last course Tillinghast designed that was complemented by a Clifford Charles Wendehack clubhouse.\nHead professionals at Winged Foot.\nWinged Foot member Tommy Armour won three major titles: the 1927 U.S. Open, 1930 PGA Championship, and the 1931 Open Championship.\nClaude Harmon, Sr. was the head professional at Winged Foot G.C. when he won the 1948 Masters and collected a check for $2,500. He was the last club professional to win a major championship. Previously, Winged Foot head professional Craig Wood won the 1941 Masters and U.S. Open, the first time any golfer won those two titles in the same year.\nMajor championships held at Winged Foot.\nWinged Foot's West Course has hosted the U.S. Open six times and the PGA Championship once. The East Course has hosted the U.S. Women's Open twice and the U.S. Senior Open.\nWinged Foot Golf Club has also hosted the U.S. Amateur twice; in 2004, the tournament was contested on both courses. The 1949 Walker Cup was played on the West Course.\nIn January 2013, the United States Golf Association announced that Winged Foot Golf Club would host the 120th U.S. Open in 2020. With its sixth U.S. Open, only Oakmont Country Club and Baltusrol Golf Club have hosted the tournament more times.\nFor USGA championships, the West Course has been typically set up at par 70. In this configuration the converted par five ninth hole becomes one of the longest par fours in major championship history. The par five twelfth is the sixth longest hole in major championship history.\nOgilvy's 2006 winning score of five-over-par and Irwin's seven-over in 1974 represent two of the highest major championship 72-hole scores in the modern era of golf. Julius Boros' winning score of 293 (+9) in the 1963 U.S. Open (at The Country Club near Boston), played in gusty winds, represents both the highest aggregate score and highest score in relation to par during this era.\nOn January 9, 2023, it was announced Winged Foot will host the U.S. Open for a seventh time in 2028, the first since 2006 at the course with ticketed spectators."

The game is followed by \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2007\" (\"Ricky Ponting International Cricket 2007\" in Australia and New Zealand and \"Yuvraj Singh International Cricket\" in India).\nDetails.\nThis game is the follow-up to \"Brian Lara Cricket '99\" (also known as \"Shane Warne Cricket '99\" in Australia and New Zealand). It contains the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Africa and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. These two competitions are licensed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and contain official player names, faces, kits, badges and sponsors. All other modes are unofficial as the rights for these belong to EA Sports and therefore some players and kits are made up; for example Graham Thorpe becomes \"G Thrip\" and Shane Warne becomes \"S Worde\". The only correct names in these modes are Brian Lara himself, (shown as \"B Lara\"), and Australian Captain Ricky Ponting (similarly shown as R Ponting). The game is also first to include licensed bats such as the Kookaburra Diablo and the GM Purist. The game takes the perspective of the normal cricket TV coverage, other views and displays in the game also try to emulate TV coverage of cricket, for example Hawk-Eye, an electronic system used to track cricket balls as they are bowled is featured in the game.\nGame modes.\nThere are a few types of cricket that can be played in the game. Test match, Test series, One Day match, World Cup, ICC Champion's Trophy and practice mode. Along with the types of cricket there are several difficulty settings. Slog mode, village, county and test. With each difficulty bowling and batting decreases in ease. The game also offers the player to construct their own team from cricketers already in the game, and to construct their own \"Career Players\" who gain experience with each match. There is also a \"Classic XI\" mode, which has famous cricketers of the past such as W.G. Grace, Imran Khan and Jim Laker.\nChallenges.\nThere are also a challenge mode in the game, where the player can take on cricketing challenges based on notable cricket matches from the past. The player can either recreate or rewrite history, depending on the team they choose to play as. These include such matches as \"The birth of The Ashes\", the 1933 Bodyline test match, Garfield Sobers' six sixes, and the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup final. There are 10 challenges in total.\nReaction and criticism.\nReaction from critics was very good with ratings averaging around 7.5 out of 10."

        "text": "Richard Charles Nolan (March 26, 1932 – November 11, 2007) was an American football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL), and served as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints.\nEarly years.\nIn his youth, Nolan was the starting quarterback at White Plains High School. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Maryland, where he was converted to running back and safety. He received honorable-mention All-American honors as a senior. He was a key contributor to the school's 1953 championship team.\nProfessional career.\nIn the NFL, he played for a total of nine seasons (1954–62) in the defensive halfback, safety, and defensive back positions. He was selected in the fourth round (41st overall) of the 1954 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. On May 10, 1958, he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals. He returned to the Giants in 1959.\nOn April 27, 1962, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in a three-team deal, with the Green Bay Packers acquiring kicking specialist Allen Green and the Giants obtaining a draft pick from the Packers. He reunited with former teammate Tom Landry, who used Nolan as a \"player-coach\". When Nolan was injured halfway through his first season, he became the Cowboys' defensive coordinator.\nCoaching career.\nNolan was on the Cowboys' staff for six years, the last year being the season in which the Cowboys played in the Ice Bowl. Landry came up with the \"flex defense\", a 3-4 alignment that Nolan would utilize for his head coaching career. On January 19, 1968, he was hired as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. With a focus on defense that featured future Hall of Famer Dave Wilcox alongside Skip Vanderbundt and defensive end Cedrick Hardman to go with a line ready to protect quarterback John Brodie, the Niners soon became a threat in the NFC. He would coach there for eight seasons from 1968 through 1975, noted for developing the defense and taking the team to three straight NFC West division titles (1970–72), twice missing the Super Bowl by only one game (1970–71). The playoff victory over Minnesota in 1970 was the first playoff win for the 49ers since 1949. Brodie was named MVP after the 1970 season, the first player to win the award in team history. \nNolan was hired to coach the linebackers for the New Orleans Saints in 1977. When Hank Stram was fired at the end of the season, Nolan was promoted to head coach on February 6, 1978, becoming the 6th head coach in the twelfth season of the franchise. He coached the Saints from 1978–80 going 15–29. He was the first Saints head coach to win more than five games in a season. They went 7–9 in 1978, with quarterback Archie Manning having his first Pro Bowl selection on the strength of his first 3,000 yard season as a pro. With three games to go in the 1979 season, the Saints were tied for first in the NFC West with Los Angeles at 7-6, having gone from 0-3 to winning seven of the next ten. They cratered from there, with a 35–14 lead versus the Oakland Raiders at home unraveling into a 42–35 loss (with 21 coming in the final quarter). They lost the following week to San Diego before a victory over the Rams had them finishing 8–8, which was their first .500 season in team history. They had five Pro Bowl selections, most notably with Manning, Chuck Muncie, and Wes Chandler. Nolan was fired by the Saints in 1980 after an 0–12 start on November 26, a season that saw Chuck Muncie traded four weeks in. His last game was on November 24 of that season, a 27–7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on \"Monday Night Football\" at home, where fans took to throwing paper airplanes. Upon the dismissal, GM Steve Rosenbloom stated Nolan was \"a man of character, class and dignity.\" The Saints finished the 1980 season 1–15, as interim coach Dick Stanfel won only one of his four games, a 21–20 victory over the New York Jets in week 15.\nHis alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park, interviewed Nolan for the head coach vacancy created when Jerry Claiborne left for Kentucky, but ultimately, chose Bobby Ross, instead.\nNolan holds the dubious distinction of being the head coach of the Arena Football League's San Antonio Force in 1992, the only team in Arena history to be shut out, 50-0 by the Orlando Predators on June 13, 1992\nNolan was well known for wearing business suits while coaching, as did many other coaches during his era. The NFL has since disallowed this practice in most circumstances due to the league signing exclusive apparel deals with sportswear companies (specifically Reebok and Nike). The league made an exception after Nolan's death in 2007, allowing Nolan's son Mike, coach of the San Francisco 49ers and Jack Del Rio, coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, to wear suits in the elder Nolan's honor."

He was born in Halmstad in south-west Sweden and played in the Sweden men's national handball team between 1964 and 1972. He is better known as being the coach for the Swedish team from 1988 to 2004.\nHis nickname was \"Bengan\", a common nickname in Sweden for people named Bengt. He was recognisable by his Halmstad dialect way of speaking. He invented a special tactic known as \"Gurkburken\" (\"The Gherkin Jar\"), which he pronounced with his distinguished dialect.\nDuring his time as a coach the Swedish national team (occasionally known as the \"Bengan Boys\"), won several international championships, including two World Championships (1990 and 1999), four European Championships (1994, 1998, 2000 and 2002) and three silver medals at the Olympic Games (1992, 1996 and 2000).\nHe was succeeded as national coach by Ingemar Linnéll.\nJohansson died on 8 May 2022, at the age of 79. He suffered from Parkinson's disease."

        "title": "1954 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1954 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the fifth World Cup in FIFA history. The game was played at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, on 4 July 1954, and saw West Germany beat the heavily favoured Golden Team of Hungary 3–2. Earlier in the group stage, Hungary had defeated West Germany 8–3.\nThe 1954 final is often listed as one of the greatest matches in World Cup history, and also one of its most unexpected upsets. Beyond football, some historians ascribe the match a lasting impact on both German and Hungarian post-World War II history, contributing in West Germany to a sense of regained international recognition after the lost Second World War and denazification, and in Hungary to discontent with the communist-authoritarian regime in the run-up to the 1956 Hungarian revolution. In Germany, the 1954 final is known as the Miracle of Bern (German: \"Wunder von Bern\", ).\nThe win earned Germany its first of four World Cup titles, with the other titles to follow in 1974 and 1990 as West Germany, and in 2014 as reunified Germany. West Germany was the third country to win a World Cup, following Uruguay (1930 and 1950) and Italy (1934 and 1938), although, different from Uruguay and Italy, West Germany won its maiden title as a guest rather than host. For Hungary, the second place in 1954 remains the best World Cup result to date, jointly with finishing runners-up in 1938. The 1954 tournament is the only FIFA World Cup thus far in which two teams from Central Europe contested the final, with another Central European team, that of Austria, finishing third in the competition.\nBackground.\nHungary.\nHungary's legendary \"Golden Team\" – also known as the \"Mighty Magyars\" – was the favorite to win the 1954 World Cup. In the five years prior to the final, it had remained unbeaten in 31 games (32 if counting a match against East Germany in 1952 that is not considered an official international). Hungary was also the reigning Olympic Champion and winner of the Central European International Cup in 1953. In 1953, Hungary had defeated England 6–3 at Wembley, becoming the first team outside the United Kingdom and Ireland to beat England on home soil, and had thrashed England 7–1 in Budapest just before the World Cup. Hungary did not have to play qualifiers for the 1954 World Cup, as opponent Poland withdrew for lack of prospects.\nThe players of the Hungary national team were full-time professionals. Most played for the army club Budapest Honvéd FC, or for MTK Budapest FC, which, in the 1950s, was run by Hungary's secret police. Several members of the Golden Team were well known and highly regarded for their skills, including forwards Sándor Kocsis and Ferenc Puskás, attacking midfielder Nándor Hidegkuti, half-back József Bozsik, outside forward Zoltán Czibor and goalkeeper Gyula Grosics. Coach Gusztáv Sebes, who was also Hungary's Deputy Minister for Sport, and MTK coach Márton Bukovi are credited with developing further the rigid WM formation that was standard in European football in the early 1950s. \nInnovations included pulling Hidegkuti – who was nominally listed as centre-forward – back into midfield to create space for the inside forwards, Puskás and Kocsis; employing Bozsik as deep-lying playmaker, with the other half-back, József Zakariás, covering for Bozsik; requesting full-backs to assist in attack and wingers to assist in defence; and introducing flexible positional play that created confusion among opponents used to fixed roles and strict man-marking.\nWest Germany.\nThe three German entities emerging from the Second World War – West Germany, East Germany and the Saar protectorate – were not admitted to FIFA until late 1950. As a result, Germany missed the 1950 FIFA World Cup. In the early 1950s, Sepp Herberger – resuming the role as national team coach that he had already occupied between 1936 and 1942 – built the West German team around a nucleus of players from the club 1. FC Kaiserslautern, the German champions of 1951 and 1953, led by veteran playmaker Fritz Walter. \nThe players were semi-professionals (\"Vertragsspieler\"), who often worked in a second job or owned a business to support their incomes. Prior to the 1954 tournament, West Germany had played only a few friendly internationals and a short qualifying campaign (against Norway and the Saar). This lack of international exposure left both national and foreign observers unclear about the quality of the German team. \nHerberger advocated clear roles in defence but permanent positional switches in attack – dubbed the \"Herberger whirl\" – to unseat the opponents' defenders.\nRoute to the final.\nHungary.\nIn the first stage, Hungary and West Germany were drawn into the same group (2). Hungary opened the World Cup with a 9–0 win over South Korea. It then played Germany, winning 8–3, and therefore qualified for the quarter-finals. In the game, Puskás suffered an ankle hairline fracture from a foul by German central defender Werner Liebrich that made Puskás miss the quarter- and semi-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Hungary beat co-favorites Brazil – runners-up of the 1950 World Cup – with 4–2, despite Puskás' absence. The hard-fought, grueling match became famous as the Battle of Berne. In the semi-finals, Hungary defeated defending World Cup champions Uruguay 4–2 after extra time. Also this match is regarded a classic for the high quality of both sides' attacking game. Kocsis scored twice in both the quarter- and semi-finals.\nFrom a statistical perspective, on the eve of the 1954 World Cup final, the Hungarian team held the highest Elo score for a national side to that date. Its rating was surpassed only in 2014 by Germany.\nWest Germany.\nWest Germany first played Turkey, winning 4–1. In the subsequent 3–8 loss to Hungary, Herberger rested several key players and played others out of position (for example, Fritz Walter as central striker instead of playmaker). The main purpose was to preserve energy for the upcoming decider against (once more) Turkey. However, by sparing his strongest eleven, Herberger may have obscured the real strength of the German team to its subsequent opponents, including Hungary. Germany won the decider against Turkey 7–2.\nWest Germany went as outsider into both its quarter- and semi-final matches. In the quarter-finals, West Germany beat highly regarded Yugoslavia – the Olympic silver medalists of 1952 – with 2–0. The team then went on to defeat Austria in the semi-finals, with an unexpectedly lopsided score of 6–1.\nPre-match.\nTeam preparations.\nDuring the tournament, the Hungarian team took residence in a hotel in the town center of Solothurn. This had several repercussions. As Hungary's semi-final against Uruguay was decided only after extra time, the team missed the return bus from Lausanne, and had to organize private cars that arrived only late at night. The evening before the final, a village fair took place in front of the hotel that lasted until the early morning hours and disrupted the players' sleep. Further, Herberger's assistant Albert Sing checked into the hotel, from where he reported about the Hungarian team preparations.\nBy contrast, the German team resided in the tranquil lake town of Spiez, where it was unaffected from such disturbances. The \"Spirit of Spiez\" became proverbial in Germany for describing the team's morale and comradeship.\nLineups and tactics.\nPuskás returned to the Hungarian squad for the final, despite doubts about his fitness. Further, Sebes replaced the customary right winger László Budai with Mihály Tóth, as he considered Budai too exhausted after the semi-finals. He also placed left winger Czibor on the right in the first half (switching with Tóth), to exploit Czibor's speed against Germany's left fullback Werner Kohlmeyer. Other than this, Sebes fielded his standard formation.\nThe German team had evolved in the course of the tournament, finding its final formation only in the semi-finals. In particular, central defender Liebrich and right winger Helmut Rahn secured places in the starting lineup only after strong performances in the quarter-finals against Yugoslavia. In the final, Herberger had Hidegkuti marked by a midfielder, Horst Eckel, to prevent Hidegkuti from pulling Liebrich out of the defence when he dropped deep into midfield. He also instructed left winger Hans Schäfer to cover Bozsik when Hungary was attacking, to help Fritz Walter – who normally would have been Bozsik's marker – preserve energy and concentrate on organising the German game.\nConditions.\nThe match was played in heavy rain, conditions that the German side had christened \"Fritz Walter weather\", as Walter was known for playing his best football in the wet. In addition, the German team was equipped with boots supplied by Adidas that featured hitherto unknown, exchangeable, screw-in studs. The boots could be adapted to any weather, enabling the German players to wear their regular footwear despite the adverse conditions.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nPuskás put his team ahead after only six minutes, when Bozsik intercepted a pass from Liebrich and found Kocsis with a through ball. Kocsis' blocked shot fell to Puskás, and Puskás scored from close range. Czibor added a second goal for Hungary a mere two minutes later, exploiting a misunderstanding in the German defense: Kohlmeyer secured a through ball from Bozsik but wrong-footed goalkeeper Toni Turek with a back pass, who failed to control the ball. Czibor sprinted in between and put the ball into the empty net.\nWest Germany came back quickly. In the 10th minute, Fritz Walter played Rahn free on the left wing, who crossed low and hard into the center. The ball went through the legs of right fullback Jenő Buzánszky, Zakariás lunged for the ball but could only deflect it, and forward Max Morlock converted from close range. Eight minutes later Morlock dribbled through the Hungarian defense, but center back Gyula Lóránt cleared for a corner. Fritz Walter played the corner short, Buzánszky cleared for another corner. The second corner kick came long and high, finding Rahn, who leveled the score.\nHungary took control after the equalizer and came to several good chances. In the 23rd minute, left fullback Mihály Lantos chipped the ball into the box, Kocsis headed on to Hidegkuti, but Hidegkuti's volley was saved spectacularly by Turek. Four minutes later, Hidegkuti fired another shot from the edge of the penalty box that hit the goal post. Only towards the end of the first half did West Germany come to more chances. In the 42nd minute, Fritz Walter found Schäfer in the penalty box, who dribbled past Lóránt and forced a save at full stretch from Grosics. The loose ball fell to Rahn, but Buzánszky cleared on the goal line.\nHungary came out attacking in the second half and created plentiful chances. Two minutes after the restart, Bozsik played Puskás free in the penalty box, but Puskás fired the ball straight at Turek. In the 54th minute, Kohlmeyer cleared twice on the goal line from Tóth, and three minutes later Kocsis headed a cross by Tóth against the cross bar. \nIn the 67th minute, Turek saved a shot by Puskás with his foot, and in the 78th minute he left the goal line to block a through ball from Bozsik ahead of the onrushing Czibor. Hidegkuti picked up the loose ball but shot into the side netting. West Germany's first good chance of the second half came in the 72nd minute when Fritz Walter played Rahn free after a corner kick, and Rahn's powerful shot from the edge of the penalty box was saved by Grosics.\nWith six minutes left, Schäfer dispossessed Bozsik and played a high cross into the penalty box. Rahn picked up Lantos' short clearance, feinted a pass to center forward Ottmar Walter that wrong-footed the Hungarian defenders, moved into the penalty box, and drove the ball hard and low past Grosics for the third German goal. Two minutes later, Puskás appeared to have leveled the score once more when he converted a through ball from Tóth flicked on by Kocsis, but the attempt was ruled offside. In the final minute of the game, Czibor had another chance to equalize, but his shot from close range was again stopped by Turek.\nThe whistle soon thereafter ended not only the match, but also the Golden Team's unbeaten run.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nStatistics.\nA match analysis by the website \"spielverlagerung.de\", produced 60 years after the game based on data extracted from Herbert Zimmermann's live radio commentary, shows Hungary ahead in most categories, except goals scored. Hungarian superiority was especially pronounced during minutes 20–40 and 45–70, while West Germany had good phases towards the end of the first and second halves.\nThe analysis also suggests that many Hungarian attacks went through the centre, in most cases orchestrated by Bozsik, who played numerous accurate through balls to Hungary's forwards. By contrast, the German team attacked almost exclusively from the wings, with Fritz Walter playing a key role as ball distributor and flexible offensive player generating numerical superiority in select portions of the pitch.\nFurther, the data point to an excellent defensive performance by Liebrich, who – according to Zimmermann's commentary – blocked six shots, intercepted nine passes, and won all of his 10 one-on-one duels.\nControversies.\nRefereeing decisions.\nSeveral calls by the English referee William Ling came under scrutiny after the final. These included:\nDoping allegations.\nImmediately after the match, rumors emerged that the German team had taken performance-enhancing substances. Several members of the team fell ill with jaundice, presumably from a contaminated needle, and of them, winger Richard Herrmann, died just eight years later of cirrhosis, at the age of 39. Members of the team later claimed they had been injected glucose, and the team physician Franz Loogen said in 2004 that the players had only been given Vitamin C before the game. \nIn 2010, of the Humboldt University of Berlin challenged the validity of these claims, stating: \"Vitamin C is not injected. This is very unusual. They could have just eaten an orange instead.\" As the co-author of a study conducted by the University of Leipzig, he also hypothesized that the German players, unbeknownst to them, may have been injected with Pervitin (methamphetamine) – a stimulant given to soldiers in World War II.\nIn 2013, the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" publicized details from the finished, 800-page study, in which Eggers and his team stated that the use of amphetamines became \"normal\" in German football from the end of the 1940s, and reaffirmed their previous claim that an unspecified number of players of the 1954 team received injections of Pervitin. In an interview with \"Der Spiegel\", Eggers also claimed that the German Football Association hampered their research by not allowing the team to access their archives.\nIn any case, doping was not illegal in 1954, with doping controls introduced by FIFA only in 1966.\nRadio commentaries.\nAs television was available only in a few homes or public places in 1954, the radio reports by György Szepesi and Herbert Zimmermann were the main vehicles for transmitting the World Cup final live to the Hungarian and West German populations. Both commentaries became legendary for their passionate, emotional reporting styles, and are sometimes credited with contributing to the charged atmosphere in both countries after the final.\nSzepesi – who later became the chairman of the Hungarian Football Federation – had been a household name in Hungary since his report of the Golden Team's 6–3 victory over England in 1953. He started his commentary of the World Cup final with cautious confidence, reinforced after Hungary's opening goal: \"Puskás shoots... GOAL... A WONDERFUL GOAL! ... There is the lead. Öcsi's [i.e., Puskas'] foot is fine, this one could see with this shot. ... And now: calmly, boys, just as we played at the 8–3\". Doubts started creeping in after Germany shortened the lead – \"the clouds are piling up in front of the mountains... hopefully this is not a bad sign\" – and grew stronger at half time – \"it will be even more difficult than the matches before, more difficult perhaps than against Brazil and Uruguay\".\nSzepesi's doubts gave way to desperation with Germany's winning goal – \"dear listeners, Rahn's shot is in the goal, in the right corner, six minutes before the end... The boys are standing there, distraught. The crowd screams. Six more minutes. The Hungarian team has played brilliantly – I cannot say anything else. My tears are flowing, but believe me, the boys gave it all.\" – and Puskás disallowed equalizer – \"Puskás, you have the ball!!! SHOT!!! GOAL!!! ... OFFSIDE, offside; Griffiths indicated offside, my listeners, Griffiths has given offside – oh what a pity... what a pity\". At the final whistle, Szepesi was fighting for composure: \"end of the game. West Germany's team is World Champion. Dear listeners, it is hard for me to say anything, believe me... But let's recognize that the West Germans were very fair and won deservedly. ... We have been unbeaten for four years. Now we have lost. This is not a tragedy, my listeners... this is a defeat in a football match\".\nBy contrast, Zimmermann kept expectations low at the outset, and continued in this vein after Hungary took the lead: \"this is a great day, this is a proud day – let's not be so presumptuous to think it would have to end successfully\". A measure of pride entered his voice after Germany's first – \"today it is no 3–8. Today it is not a B-team. Today Germany's strongest squad is playing\" – and second goal – \"we have equalized, against Hungary, the technically most gifted squad that one knows!\". Self-esteem grew as the match progressed – \"six minutes still to play in Bern in the first half. Score: 2–2. This is more than what we dared to hope in our wildest dreams\" – including after Buzánszky cleared Rahn's shot on the goal line: \"now, dear Hungarians, we have to say: now you have been lucky\". When Turek stopped Hidegkuti's volley from close range, Zimmermann famously called him a \"god\" and \"devil\" in the same sentence: \"shot – saved by Turek! Turek, you are a dare-devil, Turek, you are a football god!\". \nProverbial in Germany are Zimmermann's description of the winning goal – \"Bozsik, time and again Bozsik, the right half-back of the Hungarians, with the ball. He has lost the ball this time, to Schäfer... Schäfer has crossed, header... cleared. From the deep Rahn ought to shoot – Rahn shoots - GOAL!! GOAL!! GOAL!! GOAL!! ... Goal for Germany! ... Call me crazy, call me mental, I believe also football laymen should have a heart!\" – and his jubilation at the end of the match: \"Over! Over! Over! ... Over! The game is over!\". Zimmermann also complimented the Hungarian team: \"Next to them stand the Hungarians... the Hungarians, calm, collected. Kudos to these boys, who can lose so gracefully, who have demonstrated to be true World Champions: when they once get beaten, they carry the defeat with dignity.\"\nPost-match and aftermath.\nReaction in Hungary.\nThe loss came at a shock to Hungarian public. Spontaneous demonstrations erupted in Budapest and were directed not only against the team, but also the communist-authoritarian regime controlled by general secretary Mátyás Rákosi, which had used the Golden Team's prestige to boost its own reputation. Goalkeeper Grosics characterized the post-match atmosphere in Hungary as follows:\nSebes was severely criticized for the team's selection and tactics, and blamed the negative reaction in part on Szepesi's emotional radio report. Sebes achieved that Szepesi was temporarily removed from commenting football matches for the Hungarian State Radio. The authorities revoked player privileges, such as the tacit approval of smuggling Western goods back to Hungary. Grosics – who some Hungarians blamed for the third German goal – was accused of espionage and treason, put temporarily under house arrest, and transferred against his will from Budapest Honvéd FC to the provincial team FC Tatabánya.\nReaction in Germany.\nThe unexpected win evoked a wave of euphoria throughout Germany, which suffered from a lack of international recognition in the aftermath of World War II, and where expressions of national pride were still tainted with the recent past. Some publicists described the 1954 victory as a turning point in post-war German history, notably Arthur Heinrich and Joachim Fest. In Fest's words:\nThe World Cup final was also the first time since the Second World War that the Germany national anthem was played at a global sporting event.\n\"Mighty Magyars\" and \"Heroes of Bern\" after 1954.\nHungary's Golden Team remained largely intact until the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1956, except that coach Sebes was replaced with Bukovi in early 1956. After the revolution, Puskás, Czibor and Kocsis emigrated and, ultimately, continued their careers in Spain, playing for Real Madrid (Puskás) and FC Barcelona (Czibor and Kocsis), respectively. At the 1958 FIFA World Cup, only four players from the Mighty Magyars still featured – Bozsik, Budai, Grosics, Hidegkuti – but were unable to repeat earlier success. In the 1960s and beyond, Hidegkuti, Puskás, and Lóránt became prominent international coaches, managing clubs such as Panathinaikos (Puskás), Fiorentina (Hidegkuti), and Bayern Munich (Lóránt). Lóránt's admission to the German Sport University Cologne was arranged by Herberger. Several other Golden Team members had success as coaches in the domestic Hungarian league.\nThe West German players became instantaneously famous in Germany as the \"Heroes of Bern\". Several received lucrative offers to play abroad, but none accepted, continuing instead as semi-professionals in German clubs. Herberger overhauled the national team after the tournament. Hence, of the winning 1954 side, only Eckel, Rahn, Schäfer, and a 37-year old Fritz Walter still played at the 1958 World Cup, reaching the semi-finals. Few of the 1954 World Champions went into coaching; an exception is Liebrich, who is credited with saving his home club Kaiserslautern from Bundesliga relegation in 1965 – with Lóránt becoming Liebrich's successor in the following season. Some players had difficulties to cope with fame, and struggled at times with economic problems and alcoholism.\nIn 1990, after the downfall of the Iron Curtain, the German Football Association invited the surviving members of Hungary's 1954 team to join celebrations for Fritz Walter's 70th birthday. In the years that followed, both teams organized annual get-togethers, which Grosics described as follows:\nIn January 2015, the last surviving of the Golden Hungarian team, Jenő Buzánszky, died. The last surviving player from the match, Horst Eckel, died on 3 December 2021."

        "text": "The 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification was a series of tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 1994 FIFA World Cup featured 24 teams with one place reserved for the host nation, United States, and one place for the defending champions, Germany. The remaining 22 places were determined by a qualification process, in which 147 teams, from the six FIFA confederations, competed. Most of the successful teams were determined within these confederations, with a limited number of inter-confederation play-offs occurring at the end of the process.\nFifteen teams withdrew: Liechtenstein, Cuba, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Myanmar and Western Samoa, and three teams were excluded: Yugoslavia and Libya due to UN sanctions, and Chile for the El Maracanazo cheating incident during 1990 qualification. \nA total of 130 teams played at least one qualifying match. A total of 497 qualifying matches were played, and 1446 goals were scored (an average of 2.91 per match).\nThe first qualification match, between Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, was played on 21 March 1992, and the Puerto Rican forward Marcos Lugris scored the first goal in qualification. Qualification ended on 17 November 1993, when European qualification ended and the OFC–CONMEBOL play-off match was played. Eighteen of FIFA's twenty-four top-ranked countries eventually qualified.\nQualification process.\nThe draw was made in New York on 8 December 1991 at Madison Square Garden.\nFor the first time, three teams qualified from the African zone, because of its performance in the previous tournament. The 24 spots available in the 1994 World Cup were distributed among the continental zones as follows:\nUEFA, AFC and CAF have a guaranteed number of places, whereas the number of qualifiers from other confederations is dependent on play-offs between OFC's first-placed team and CONCACAF's second-placed team and the winner of this fixture against CONMEBOL's fourth-placed team.\nAfter the first round of 1994 FIFA World Cup finals, the percentage of teams from each confederation that passed through to the round of 16 was as follows:\nTiebreakers.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a league format, the method used for separating teams level on points is the same for all Confederations. If teams are even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams will be ranked by:\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a home-and-away knockout format, the team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time are played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out.\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\nQualification for AFC teams consisted of two rounds. Round one saw the teams divided into 6 groups, each team playing the others in their group twice. The winner of each group then went into a final group where they played each other once.\nThe qualification process began with 29 national teams vying for two spots. Saudi Arabia and Korea Republic qualified.\nCAF.\nQualification for CAF teams also consisted of two rounds. Round one saw the teams divided into 9 groups, each team playing the others in their group twice. The winners of these groups then went into three final groups where they played each other twice.\nThe qualification process began with 40 national teams vying for three spots. Nigeria, Morocco and Cameroon qualified.\nCONCACAF.\nThere were three rounds of play for CONCACAF teams. Mexico and Canada received byes and advanced to the second round directly. The remaining teams were divided into Caribbean and Central American zones. In the Caribbean zone, 14 teams played in knockout matches on a home-and-away basis to determine three winners advancing to the second round. In the Central American zone, the six teams were paired up to play knockout matches on a home-and-away basis. The winners advanced to the second round.\nIn the second round, the eight teams were divided into two groups of four teams each. They played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the final round.\nIn the final round, the four teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner qualified. The runner-up advanced to the CONCACAF–OFC intercontinental play-off. Mexico took the guaranteed spot and Canada qualified for the play-off.\nCONMEBOL.\nNine CONMEBOL teams entered the competition (Chile was banned by FIFA due to the 1989 Maracanazo incident). The nine teams were divided into two groups. The teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. Group A had one guaranteed place and one play-off spot, while Group B had two spots for the finals. Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia qualified automatically and Argentina qualified for the play-off.\nOFC.\nQualification for OFC teams consisted of two rounds. Seven teams entered initially and were divided into two groups, but Western Samoa withdrew. The two group winners then played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The winner advanced to the CONCACAF–OFC intercontinental play-off. Australia won the tie and advanced.\nUEFA.\n38 were initially involved in UEFA qualifying, but Liechtenstein withdrew and Yugoslavia was suspended.\nThe thirty-six teams were divided into six groups: one group of five teams, four groups of six teams each, and one group of seven teams.

        "title": "Tony Taylor (baseball)",
        "text": "Antonio Nemesio Taylor Sánchez (December 19, 1935July 16, 2020) was a Cuban baseball second baseman who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, and Detroit Tigers from 1958 until 1976. He batted and threw right-handed and also played third base and first base.\nTaylor was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Giants in 1954 and played for three of their minor league affiliates until 1957, when the Chicago Cubs drafted him in that year's Rule 5 draft and promoted him to the major leagues. After spending two seasons with the organization, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1960, the same year he was selected twice as an All-Star. He was subsequently dealt in mid-1971 to the Detroit Tigers, who released him after two seasons. He returned to the Phillies and played his last game on September 29, 1976.\nEarly life.\nTaylor was born in Central Alava, Matanzas Province, on December 19, 1935. He was of American descent through his father, who died in 1957. His mother's parents were Chinese; they changed their name to Sánchez upon arrival in Cuba. \nTaylor's younger brother, Jorge, also played baseball with a minor league affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds in 1960. Taylor also had a sister (Estrella). He started playing baseball when he was seven or eight years old. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Giants in April 1954.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor posted a career .261 batting average with 75 home runs and 598 RBI in 2195 games.\nTaylor signed at age 18 as a third baseman in the New York Giants organization. He debuted in the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs in 1958; he was their starting second baseman in 1958 and 1959.\nTaylor had a small role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place on June 30, 1959, when the St. Louis Cardinals played the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Stan Musial was at the plate facing Bob Anderson with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, the ball evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called \"ball four\", but Anderson and Sammy Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball, which would mean the ball was actually strike two. While Delmore was embroiled in an argument with Anderson and Sammy Taylor, Musial ran for second base. Seeing that Musial was running to second, third baseman Alvin Dark retrieved the ball, which briefly wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark recovered it. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore produced a new baseball and gave it to Sammy Taylor. When Anderson saw Musial trying for second, he took the new ball from Sammy Taylor and threw it towards Tony Taylor covering second base, and the ball went over the latter's head into the outfield. Meanwhile, Dark threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see the throw and he was declared out when the tag was made.\nTaylor was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Cal Neeman for Don Cardwell and Ed Bouchee early in the 1960 season. Despite the fact that Philadelphia was a mediocre team, Taylor established himself and was named to the National League All-Star team that year.\nA solid and dependable performer, Taylor set a Phillies team record by playing 1,003 games at second base (later broken by Chase Utley), and his six steals of home ranks him second on the Phillies' all-time list.\nTaylor appeared on a live satellite broadcast feed on July 23, 1962, in the first live transatlantic broadcast, relayed by Telstar in the 20 minutes that it orbited over the Atlantic Ocean. As lead-in filler before a speech by President John F. Kennedy, a 90-second clip of a game between the Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, featuring Taylor hitting a ball pitched by Cal Koonce to right fielder George Altman, was captured and broadcast live to Europe.\nIn 1963, Taylor hit .281 and collected career highs in runs (102) and hits (182), and the next season, he made the defensive play that saved Jim Bunning's perfect game. In 1970, he hit a career-high .301 average with 26 doubles, nine triples and nine homers.\nTaylor was dealt from the Phillies to the Detroit Tigers for minor-league right-handed pitchers Carl Cavanaugh and Mike Fremuth on June 11, 1971. He helped them to a division title a year later. A free agent before the 1974 season, he signed again with the Phillies and became a valuable utility man and pinch hitter for his final three major league seasons.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring as a player, Taylor became a major league coach for the Phillies from 1977 to 1979, and again from 1988 to 1989. In the intervening time, he was manager in the organization's minor league system and a roving instructor. He served as a minor league coach with the Giants starting in 1990. Two years later, he became minor league coordinator of the Florida Marlins, before becoming their major league coach from 1999 to 2001, and again in 2004.\nTaylor was enshrined in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981. He was subsequently inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Wall of Fame in 2002, and the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame two years later.\nTaylor died on July 16, 2020, at the age of 84. He had suffered a stroke one year before at the conclusion of an event for retired players at Citizens Bank Park, and died due to complications arising from it."

        "title": "Rafael Araújo (basketball)",
        "text": "Rafael Paulo de Lara Araújo (; born August 12, 1980) is a Brazilian former professional basketball player. He played for three years in the National Basketball Association.\nCollege career.\nAfter attending Padre Anacleto High School in São Paulo, Araújo went to the United States to play college basketball, attending Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona. In his freshman season (2000–01), he averaged 12.1 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. Araújo later explained that AWC coach Kelly Green gave him $400 to get his visa and establish himself in Yuma, despite coaches being forbidden to do so. As a sophomore, he tallied 17.9 points and 10.7 rebounds per game, leading the Matadors to a 28-3 record and a top ten national ranking among junior colleges. He was named Region Most Valuable Player and 2nd Team NJCAA All-American. At the same time Araújo was drafted for the Brazil national basketball team at the 2002 World Championships, as NBA player Nenê could not attend the tournament.\nAfter finishing his junior college career, Araújo moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where as a junior (2002–03), he averaged 12.0 points and 8.9 rebounds per game (second in the Mountain West Conference). In his senior season, Araújo led BYU in scoring (18.4 points per game), rebounding (10.1 rebounds per game), steals (43 total), and blocked shots (25). He was named Co-Player of the Year in the Mountain West Conference, sharing the honor with Air Force's Nick Welch. He was named 2nd Team NCAA All-American by \"Basketball Times\" and Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press.\nWith his size and strength, the 6-foot-11, 295-pound Araújo impressed many pro scouts during his senior season. On December 6, 2003, he dominated a tough Oklahoma State team, totaling 32 points and 17 rebounds in BYU's 76-71 upset victory. He concluded his collegiate career with a 24-point, 12-rebound performance in the Cougars' 80-75 loss to Syracuse in the NCAA Tournament.\nControversy.\nDuring the 2002 World Championships in Indianapolis, Araújo tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. He was given a 24-month suspension from international play. He was subsequently found clean during tests while a player at BYU, and the NBA did not test players for steroid use. Araújo explained that the tests went positive because at the time he consumed a dietary supplement containing androstenedione, but he could still play because he was only suspended by FIBA, who does not sanction college basketball.\nAraújo was involved in multiple on-court incidents during his senior season at BYU. On March 6, 2004, Araújo was reprimanded by the Mountain West Conference (MWC) for hitting UNLV guard Jerel Blassingame during an 89-88 win. Six days later on March 12, in a 54-51 loss to Utah, Araujo was charged with a technical foul for elbowing the Utes' Andrew Bogut in the head in the MWC Tournament.\nProfessional career.\nThe Toronto Raptors selected Araújo with the eighth pick in the 2004 NBA draft, making him the first college senior drafted that year, one pick ahead of future NBA finals MVP Andre Iguodala. His NBA career was mostly disappointing with him seeing limited action as a rookie, averaging 3.3 points and 3.1 rebounds in 12.5 minutes per game. He set a career-high with 14 rebounds against the Sacramento Kings on January 5, 2005. Days later, on January 9, he scored a career-high 14 points against the Golden State Warriors. He later matched that total against the Kings on November 25, 2005.\nIn the 2005-06 season, he again struggled through a disappointing year and had trouble getting playing time, averaging 11.6 minutes a game, 2.3 points, and 2.8 rebounds while shooting a dismal 36.6% from the field. Shortly after that season, Toronto GM Rob Babcock was fired, and it was rumored that the firing, in part, had to do with the drafting of Araújo. The player claimed he did not play much with the Raptors because then-coach Sam Mitchell held a grudge against Babcock, and thus he did not want to put Babcock's draft pick on the court.\nOn June 8, 2006, Araújo was traded to the Utah Jazz with an undisclosed amount of money for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley. Many viewed this as a new beginning for Araújo, a chance for him to change the direction of his career. He worked hard in Utah, dropping his weight from 295 pounds to 275 in an effort to improve his athleticism. He also expressed much interest as he already played in Utah during college. However, he did not fit in well in Utah's offense, which was already set with Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur in the frontcourt, and Araújo played sparingly during the 2006-07 season. He averaged 2.6 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 28 games, averaging only 8.9 minutes per appearance.\nAraújo's rookie contract expired after the 2006-07 season, and Jazz owner Larry H. Miller said publicly that he liked Araújo and hoped he could return to the team the following season. Araújo's final NBA game was played in Game 5 of the 2007 Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs on May 30, 2007. Utah will lose the game 84 - 109, with Araújo recording 7 points, 4 rebounds and 1 steal. San Antonio thus won the entire series 4 - 1.\nAraújo played for Utah in the 2007 Rocky Mountain Revue, but the Jazz signed 7-foot-1 Kyrylo Fesenko during the offseason, filling the roster spot that Araújo held previously. With that opportunity gone, and his NBA career likely over, Araújo signed a 1-year, $500,000 contract to play for Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia. Araújo claimed that despite the easy adaptation, his lack of European passport and Spartak's underperformances led him to leave.\nAraújo was in training camp with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for 2008 but was waived before the 2008-09 season. He claimed that this happened because of the arrival of Kevin Love, and because Araújo was not in top shape due to an injured knee.\nAfter a brief and failed stint at the Shanghai Sharks, in January 2009, Araújo signed with Brazilian club Flamengo for the 2009 season. The details of his contract were not revealed. He became the star of the club's team alongside Marcelinho Machado. Six months later, at the end of the 2009 season, he signed a deal with Paulistano for the 2009-10 season, and in June 2010 he transferred back to Flamengo signing a two-year contract. For his second stint at Flamengo, Araújo, for numerology reasons, changed the spelling of his nickname to \"Bàbby\" and his jersey number from 55 to 66.\nAraújo made headlines in January 2011 by shattering a glass backboard with a powerful dunk during a game in the FIBA Americas League. Video of the play was widely circulated across the Internet.\nIn June 2011, he signed a deal with Franca Basquetebol Clube. In 2012, Araújo decided to retire, though he was open to return to basketball if he had a good proposal.\nIn October 2012, Araujo returned to basketball, signing with Mogi das Cruzes. He moved to Pinheiros in 2014.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "Charles Francis Fox (October 7, 1921 – February 16, 2004) was an American manager, general manager, scout, coach—and, briefly, a catcher—in Major League Baseball. As manager of the National League West Division champion San Francisco Giants in , he was named \"Manager of the Year\" by \"The Sporting News\".\nEarly career.\nBorn in New York City, Fox appeared in only three games as a Major League player—garnering three hits in seven at bats for a career batting average of .429—with the 1942 New York Giants. However, Fox would spend another 33 years at the Major and Minor League level as a player, manager, scout and coach for the Giants, who relocated to San Francisco in 1958.\nFox spent more than a half-century in professional baseball, including stints as manager of the Montreal Expos and Chicago Cubs as well as the Giants.\nBorn in the Bronx, he broke into big-league baseball in an unusual way. \"I was 14, selling newspapers near the Polo Grounds with 24 cents in my pocket,\" he once recalled, \"when a couple of tough kids came at me. I put up my dukes, and two Giants coaches saw me handling myself pretty good. They complimented me and asked if I could catch. I lied -- I said I could. They gave me a mitt and told me to help their pitchers in practice. \"After a couple of hours, they handed me $5, as much as I made in a month hustling newspapers. That did it. From then on, I dreamed and worked only toward my goal of becoming a Giants catcher.\"\nFox finally made it, late in 1942, for three games, going 3-for-7 at the plate in his only major-league playing action, before going into the Navy for three years of service during World War II.\nHe then began a career as a player-manager of Giants' minor-league clubs, including stops at Triple-A Tacoma and Phoenix. During his time in the minors, Fox helped develop, among others, a young, strapping first baseman named Willie McCovey. \"I knew Charlie ever since I signed as a 17-year-old kid -- he was kind of instrumental in the Giants signing me,\" McCovey said Tuesday. \"I met Charlie when he was still playing. ... We all grew together. He coached me on a couple of clubs. He was easy to play for, a fiery guy.\"\nFox spent eight years as manager of the Giants' Class C St. Cloud Rox team in the Northern League, scouted from 1957 to 1963, then managed the Giants' Triple-A Tacoma affiliate in the Pacific Coast League in 1964 before coming to the Major Leagues as a San Francisco coach under Herman Franks in 1965. He returned to the PCL to pilot the Giants' Phoenix affiliate in 1969–70 until he was summoned to San Francisco on May 24, 1970, to replace Clyde King as the manager of the MLB Giants. The Giants were stalled in fifth place in the NL West at 19–23 (.452), and had just lost a 15-inning game to San Diego, 17–16, the day before. Under Fox, the 1970 Giants recovered to go 14 games over .500 and finish third, 16 games behind Cincinnati.\nMajor League managerial career.\nFox led the Giants to the NL West title in 1971. \nIn a year known as “The Year of the Fox\", Charlie Fox led a team of aging stars and rising youngsters to a Western Division title with a 90–72 record. The Giants got off to a fast start, winning 37 of their first 51 games, and enjoyed a -game margin over the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 31. The energy and raw talents of youngsters like outfielders Bobby Bonds, Gary Matthews and Garry Maddox and shortstop Chris Speier melded nicely with the experience and wisdom of veterans Juan Marichal, Willie McCovey, and Willie Mays. Bonds smashed 33 home runs and 102 RBI. Meanwhile, pitching ace Marichal continued his domination over batters, notching 18 wins. In addition, Willie Mays, who was now 40-years old, slugged four home runs in his first four games. His production didn't let up as he went on to set a National League career record for runs scored in June. Despite such steady play, the team began to wear down near the end of the season. On September 1, San Francisco still held a comfortable, eight-game edge over the Dodgers. Then they withstood a furious assault by their in-state rivals during the pennant stretch. They saw their nine-game lead on September 4 dwindle to one game by the 25th. It wasn't until the final game of the season that the Giants clinched the Division title on Marichal's 5-1 gem over the San Diego Padres. \nThe Giants salivated at the chance to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the best-of-five 1971 National League Championship Series. They had beaten the Pirates 9-out-of-12-games and seemed likely candidates to win the pennant. The Giants jumped out of the gate full-steam ahead in the series opener, beating the Pirates, 5–4, in front of 40,977 fans at Candlestick Park. Willie McCovey and Tito Fuentes fueled the attack, ripping two-run homers in the fifth inning. However, the Giants would lose the next three games, as the Pirates would advance to the World Series in four games.\nSubsequently, they made a series of bad trades and fell from contention thereafter. On June 27, 1974, after compiling a record of 348–327 (.516), Fox was replaced as manager by former stalwart Giants catcher Wes Westrum.\nIn 1976, he joined the front office of the Montreal Expos as a special assignment scout and served as the club's \"emergency\" manager when Karl Kuehl was fired on September 4. After winning only 12 of 34 games to close out the season, Fox was named as the general manager and was later succeeded on the field by Dick Williams. He held the GM title in Montreal through the 1978 season.\nFox, however, was destined to serve another term as an interim manager. In 1983, while working as a special assistant to Chicago Cubs general manager Dallas Green, Fox took over from embattled skipper Lee Elia on August 22 and managed the Cubs for the final 39 games of the season, winning 17 and losing 22. In 1984, he was replaced by Jim Frey. Later on he coached under Green in with the New York Yankees, and scouted for the Houston Astros.\nFox's career major league managing record was 377–371 (.504).\nFox served in other various capacities, from general manager to scout, with the Expos, Cubs, New York Yankees and Houston Astros.\nFox died at age 82 in Stanford, California, and his remains were interred in Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery, Colma, California."

        "title": "American National Rugby League",
        "text": "The American National Rugby League (AMNRL) national governing body for rugby league in the United States from 1997 to 2014. \nThe organization was responsible for running the domestic club competitions and the United States national rugby league team in addition to other responsibilities during its time of operation\nThe organization was founded by Australian former professional player David Niu and throughout its existence gained recognition from the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) as the governing body for the sport in the United States.\nThe domestic competition began with six teams competing and grew to eleven teams by 2010, with plans for westward expansion. \nOn January 12, 2011, a schism occurred with seven teams departing the AMNRL to form the USA Rugby League (USARL), a rival governing body. \nIn the years that followed, the AMNRL suffered from competition with the USARL, and did not host a domestic competition after the 2013 season, though it continued to organize international team games. \nThe organization folded in 2014, with USARL becoming the recognized body for rugby league in the USA.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe roots of the American National Rugby League date to 1997, when Super League America was formed to organize a national team, establish an amateur domestic competition, and build the sport in the United States. The organization was initially established by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in an attempt to spread rugby league to the United States. The organization was run by former professional player David Niu, who had come to Philadelphia in 1992 and had been active in promoting the sport there. Super League America's domestic competition began its inaugural season in 1998, and was contested by six teams all in the Northeastern United States: the Glen Mills Bulls (later the Aston Bulls), the New Jersey Sharks (now the Bucks County Sharks in the USARL), the New York Broncos (now the New York Knights in the USARL), the Philadelphia Bulldogs (now the Philadelphia Fight in the USARL), the Boston Storm, and the Pennsylvania Raiders. The Boston and Pennsylvania teams soon dropped out; the others later formed the core of the AMNRL. Super League America organized the domestic competition in 1998 and 1999; the Glen Mills Bulls were declared league champions in both years.\nIn December 1999, Super League America announced a reorganization. The league headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida, with Jacksonville marketing executive Steve Gormley made the organization's new president; David Niu would serve as CEO and maintain the northeastern branch. The organization was renamed the United States Rugby League, and set its sights on expanding into the Southeastern United States and attracting British rugby league teams to Florida for training camps and international competitions. The USRL was successful in attracting foreign teams and advanced the U.S. national team to the Rugby League World Cup qualifiers for the first time; however, it was soon beset by internal strife.\nComplications over a deal with the British Rugby Football League led to a dispute that bankrupted the USRL. In the midst of the dispute, in May 2001 the five domestic teams announced they would form a new organization, the American National Rugby League, with Niu as its head. Later that year Gormley sold the USRL's assets to the Rugby Football League, leaving the AMNRL as the sole rugby league body in the United States.\nGrowth.\nThe AMNRL was affiliated with the Rugby League International Federation, the sport's world governing body, through Super League America. Expansion of the domestic league became a major goal for the organization, and new teams were added every few years. The Wilmington Vikings (later the New York Raiders) joined the competition in 2002, bringing the number of teams back up to six. The following year the Connecticut Wildcats of Norwalk, Connecticut and the Washington D.C. Slayers joined.\nIn 2006 the league expanded once again to include the Jacksonville Axemen, the New Haven Warriors, and the Boston Braves. After the end of the season, however, the Boston Braves folded, and two charter teams, the Media Mantarays and the Philadelphia Fight, announced they were merging. The Fairfax Eagles joined the competition in 2007, and the Boston Thirteens joined in 2009. Another charter franchise, the Bucks County Sharks, suspended operations in 2010, while the Pittsburgh Vipers were added.\nIn 2010, the AMNRL entered into a relationship with the Star Group to rebrand the league, its assets, and its teams. In 2012, the AMNRL entered into a partnership arrangement with Grand Prix Entertainment to promote and grow the game in the USA, in return for ownership of the league and TV rights to World Cup matches in 2013. This led to complications regarding the ownership of the league.\nExpansion plans.\nThe AMNRL announced various plans for future expansion at different times. Beginning in 2001 the league announced plans for a Western American National Rugby League (WAMNRL) to develop the sport on the West Coast of the United States. The AMNRL has revisited these plans several times since.\nIn 2009 league officials announced the creation of a new, fully professional league, the National Rugby League USA (NRLUS), which originally hoped to launch in 2010. The AMNRL would serve as an amateur and semi-professional feeder league for the new competition. However, the new league never got off the ground, with officials blaming the Great Recession.\nAMNRL/USARL split and collapse.\nOn January 12, 2011, seven teams announced they were breaking with the AMNRL to form a new league, the USA Rugby League (USARL). Officials cited the lack of club involvement in the AMNRL's decision-making as the reason for the split; the USA Rugby League implemented a constituency which involved member clubs in its administration. The departing teams were the Boston 13s, the D.C. Slayers, the Fairfax Eagles, the Jacksonville Axemen, the New Haven Warriors, the Philadelphia Fight, and the Pittsburgh Vipers (later the Pittsburgh Sledgehammers). Five of these teams (all except Fairfax and Pittsburgh), along with three new teams, participated in the USARL's inaugural 2011 season.\nThe AMNRL struggled over the next few years due to the competition from the USARL. The RLIF stepped in to work with the leagues toward an ultimate goal of reunification, but were unable to find a solution. The AMNRL put its domestic competition on hiatus after the 2013 season, though it continued to organize games for the national team, including the U.S.'s first ever appearance at the Rugby League World Cup in 2013, in which the Tomahawks reached the quarter-finals. The split between the leagues cost the U.S. its automatic qualification to the 2017 World Cup. In August 2014, the AMNRL announced it would cease operations to end the rift and allow the USARL to seek status as the national governing body.\nDomestic competition.\nSeason structure.\nFrom 1998 through 2013, member teams of the domestic competition competed in a Grand Final for the league championship. The winning team received the \"Ferrainola Cup\", named for American rugby league promoter Sam Ferrainola. Beginning in 2011, the AMNRL season consisted of an eight-round, seven-game regular season followed by a playoffs series culminating in the Grand Final. All six teams advanced to the playoffs, which consisted of a three-round single-elimination tournament, with the Grand Final winners receiving the championship title.\nOne of signature events in the AMNRL's domestic schedule was the War at the Shore. The event, held annually in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, generally consisted of full 13-a-side and rugby league sevens games between AMNRL teams, local and national representative sides, and developmental teams.\nTeams.\n \n \n \nSix teams played in the 2011 season. Four of these teams, the Aston Bulls, the Connecticut Wildcats, the New York Knights, and the New York Raiders, played in the AMNRL the previous season. The Bucks County Sharks, who did not compete in the 2010 season, also rejoined the league in 2011. A sixth team, the Delaware Vipers, were announced in April 2011 and played during the season. Ostensibly based in Wilmington, Delaware, the AMNRL considered them successors to the Media Mantarays, who played in the competition from 2000–2006.\nIn 2011 the AMNRL launched a Hawaii-based competition in partnership with the Hawaii Rugby League. The AMNRL dubbed this the \"Pacific Conference\", while the East Coast-based competition was named the \"Atlantic Conference\". Teams listed in the Pacific Conference as of July 16, 2011 are the Hawaii Islanders, Honolulu Titans, Kalihi Raiders, Marist Marauders, Maui Voyagers, and Tama Suma Ie. However, as of that time, only the Marist, Maui, Tama Sulu, and Kalihi teams had played games, and had not played consistently.\nIn addition, other teams competed in AMNRL-sponsored tournaments. The Chicago Stockyarders played two rugby league nines games in 2010. On June 10, 2011, the Utah Avalanche of Salt Lake City, Utah, announced they were joining the AMNRL as a developing team. The Avalanche were formed in early 2011 and were previously aligned with the USARL, playing in a USARL rugby league nines tournament in Philadelphia in May. In June 2011 they announced they were re-aligning with the AMNRL.\nOn November 26, 2011 the AMNRL announced that the Northern Virginia Eagles, formerly the Fairfax Eagles, would be reforming and joining the competition. In the new year the AMNRL released its 2011 review and announced its \"Road to the 2013 Rugby League World Cup\" which includes launching teams and competitions in the East, Midwest, West and Southwest. A further two teams were announced to be joining the league on January 13 – the Las Vegas Warriors and Colorado Blizzard were announced to be part of a Western Conference as well as new teams forming from Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nFormer teams.\nNote Delaware Valley Mantarays merged with Philadelphia Bulldogs in 2006. The AMNRL considers the Delaware Vipers to be successors to the Mantarays.\nStatistics and awards.\nLeague records.\nLargest victory: Jacksonville Axemen 90 – 8 Philadelphia Fight (2006)\nMost Valuable Player Winners.\nAt the conclusion of each season, the title of Most Valuable Player is awarded to the individual who accumulates the most points via a voting system that is undertaken after every game. Each official at the conclusion of a regular-season fixture awards either three, two or one points for the most deserving players on game day; these points are then added up to determine the MVP. Performance is not only measured by individual feats but also the influence that player has had on the performance of his respective team.\nEvery season to date has seen an individual awarded the MVP excluding the 2005 season where both Andrew Webster and Erik Hollingsworth were awarded the Most Valuable player after they finished with equal points."

        "title": "Pine Valley Golf Club",
        "text": "Pine Valley Golf Club is a golf course in Pine Valley, Camden County, in southern New Jersey. It was ranked the number one course in \"Golf Magazine\"'s 100 Top Courses in the U.S. and the World in 2012, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2023. It is a private club, and non-members can play only if invited and accompanied by a member. Pine Valley is currently ranked number one in \"Golf Digest\" America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses.\nHistory.\nPine Valley was founded in 1913 by a group of amateur golfers from Philadelphia. They purchased 184 acres (0.7 km²) of rolling, sandy ground deep in the pinelands of southern New Jersey, and gave George Arthur Crump, who knew the area from hunting expeditions, the opportunity to design the course.\nThe site was challenging and the project became something of an obsession for Crump, who sold his hotel in Philadelphia and plowed his money into the course. Marshlands had to be drained and 22,000 tree stumps had to be pulled with special steam-winches and horse-drawn cables. This was all done at a time when many golf courses were still built with minimal earth moving, and the course was called \"Crump's Folly\" by some.\nThis was Crump's first and only golf course design, but he brought together celebrated architects such as A.W. Tillinghast, Hugh Wilson, George C. Thomas Jr., Walter Travis, and H.S. Colt to help him create the course. Crump set himself some idiosyncratic principles: no hole should be laid out parallel to the next; no more than two consecutive holes should play in the same direction; and players should not be able to see any hole other than the one they were playing. He also felt that a round of golf on his course should require a player to use every club in the bag.\nThe first eleven holes opened unofficially in 1914. In 1918, when Crump died (reportedly penniless), four holes – #12, #13, #14, and #15 – were incomplete; they were finished in 1922.\nPine Valley later spread to 623 acres (2.5 km²), of which 416 acres (1.7 km²) remain virgin woodland. Since Crump's death, alterations have been made by several other leading golf course designers. The club also has a ten-hole short course designed by Tom Fazio and Ernest Ransome III.\nIn April 2021, the New Jersey Office of Attorney General's Division of Civil Rights filed a complaint claiming the club violated the law by banning women from becoming members, restricting access to women, and preventing women from owning homes on club land. A settlement was reached in May 2023, in which the club agreed to end discriminatory employment and housing practices, and educate their employees about the state's civil rights law. The club had already begun allowing women members during the investigation. In addition to these changes, the club also agreed to pay $100,000 to the Division of Civil Rights, and spend another $100,000 to create scholarships supporting the participation of women in golf\nDiscover the Power of Golf: Unleashing Your Potential\nGolf is a club-and-ball sport played on a course where players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes in as few strokes as possible. It is a challenging sport that combines physical skills, mental focus, and strategic thinking. Golf has gained popularity worldwide and is enjoyed by both amateurs and professionals.\nWhy Golf is So Hard\nMost professional athletes agree that golf is one of the hardest sports to play. While football, soccer, basketball, and chess have their own unique challenges, golf combines physical, mental, and strategic elements into one demanding sport. The precision needed to hit the ball accurately, the mental focus required to make strategic decisions, and the physical endurance to complete a round make golf a truly challenging activity.\nIs Golf Expensive?\nGolf is often considered a luxury activity and can be relatively expensive to pursue. Engaging in the sport usually requires joining a golf club or course, which can have high membership fees. Additionally, golf equipment, such as clubs, balls, shoes, and attire, can be costly. However, there are more affordable options available, such as public golf courses and second-hand equipment, making the sport accessible to a wider range of enthusiasts.\nStay Updated with Golf News\nKeeping up with the latest golf news, gear, instruction, and style is essential for any golf enthusiast. There are various sources that provide comprehensive coverage of golf tournaments, players, and courses. Some popular websites and channels include Golf Digest, ESPN Golf, NBC Sports Golf, and CBS Sports Golf. These platforms offer live coverage, interviews, highlights, statistics, predictions, and results.\nGolf Courses in Austin, Texas\nAustin, Texas, is home to several excellent golf courses where enthusiasts can hone their skills and enjoy the game. One notable course is the Butler Pitch &amp; Putt, known for its laid-back atmosphere and beautiful surroundings. It offers a great place for golf practice and even features a beer garden for players to relax after their rounds. Other golf courses in Austin provide diverse challenges and stunning scenery, making the city a great destination for golf lovers.\nPGA Tour and Golf Rankings\nThe PGA Tour is one of the most prestigious golf tours globally, featuring top professional golfers competing in various tournaments. The tour provides real-time live scoring, player stats, standings, and fantasy games. Official World Golf Rankings determine the rankings of professional golfers based on their performances in these tournaments. CBS Sports, ESPN, and Golf.com are popular platforms that provide the latest news, scores, and projections for golf enthusiasts.\nIn Conclusion\nGolf is an exciting and challenging sport that combines physical skill, mental focus, and strategic thinking. Despite its reputation for being an expensive activity, there are affordable options available for enthusiasts to enjoy the game. Staying updated with the latest golf news, gear, and instruction is important for any golf lover. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced golfer, the sport offers a unique experience and can be enjoyed in various locations, including the beautiful golf courses in Austin, Texas.\nThe Course.\n\"Pine Valley Slope, Rating, and Yardage as of 2023\"\nIn \"The Complete Golfer\", course architect Robert Trent Jones wrote that Pine Valley \"is frequently alluded to as the most difficult course in the world, and this reputation is justified. To my way of thinking, it also possesses more classic holes than any other course in the world.\" Johnny Miller wrote that \"There are no weak holes. Every single one is a masterpiece. There is a surprise around every corner, 18 unique and beautiful challenges.\"\nMembership.\nPine Valley Golf Club is a highly exclusive club. Membership is by invitation only from the board of directors. The only way a guest is allowed into the club is if they are invited and accompanied by a member, and they must have low handicaps to play the course.\nThe club voted on April 30, 2021 to remove all gender-restricted language from their bylaws after learning of the investigation by the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights.\nPrior to this women were only permitted to play the course on Sunday afternoons.\nThere are about 930 members spread throughout the world, and the list is a closely guarded secret. Notable members of the club have included George H. W. Bush, Sean Connery, Ben Crenshaw, Tom Fazio, Robert Trent Jones Jr., Connie Mack, Bob McNair, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Dan Quayle, Brian L. Roberts, Jay Sigel, George C. Thomas Jr., and A. W. Tillinghast.\nTournaments at Pine Valley.\nPine Valley hosted the Walker Cup, an amateur competition between teams from the United States and Great Britain &amp; Ireland, in 1936 and 1985.\nIn 1962, Pine Valley was the venue for an edition of Shell's Wonderful World of Golf, a match between Gene Littler and Byron Nelson.\nThe club admits spectators for one day in late September every year to watch the Crump Cup, a nationally recognized tournament featuring elite mid-amateur players.\nThe club will host the 2034 Curtis Cup.\nCrump Cup.\nThe Crump Cup is an invitational golf tournament for amateurs. The first tournament was held in 1922. It is named for George Arthur Crump, and is played on the grounds of Pine Valley Golf Club, which Crump founded. The format for the four days is two rounds of stroke play, qualifying, followed by two rounds of match play. The final round has traditionally held on the last Sunday in September. Jay Sigel has won the event the most times, with nine victories between 1975 and 1993.\nSince at least the 1970s, the public can, on the day of the final round, tour the golf course and view tournament play. This is the only day each year on which the public has access to the grounds of the club. Visitors park at the nearby Clementon Amusement Park, where a local youth athletic association charges $25 per car. Yellow school buses then take fans on a five-minute ride down a secluded side road, away from amusement park, and unload in a gravel parking lot in the woods. Visitors are not allowed to bring in cameras, video recorders, or cell phones. Admission is for the afternoon only.\nAwards and rankings.\n\"Pine Valley Awards and Rankings\""

        "text": "The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2005 were held from January 28 to February 13 in Bormio, Italy. The women's competition was held in neighboring Santa Caterina.\nBormio previously hosted the World Championships in 1985; other host cities in Italy include Cortina d'Ampezzo (1932, \"1941 (unofficial)\", and 1956 (Winter Olympics)), Val Gardena (1970), and Sestriere (1997).\nIn northern Italy, Bormio is a regular stop on the World Cup circuit, usually for a men's downhill in late December. The \"Pista Stelvio\" is among the longest and most challenging downhill courses in the world, with a vertical drop exceeding .\nThese were the last World Championships to use the traditional combined (K) format (one downhill run and two slalom runs). Starting in 2007, the world championships switched to the \"super-combined\" (SC) format (one run each of downhill &amp; slalom) for the combined event.

        "title": "Playoff (golf)",
        "text": "A playoff in the sport of golf is how a tie is resolved at the end of a match or competition, often by means of an extra hole, or holes, being played until a winner emerges.\nPlayoffs are a standard occurrence in match play and professional stroke play tournaments to determine a winner in the event of a tie at the completion of normal play. There are two types of playoff that are used: aggregate playoff and sudden death. They are usually played directly after completion of the final round, with the exception of 18 hole aggregate playoffs which may be held the following day.\nIn many amateur stroke play tournaments, and particularly in club competitions, competitors may not be readily available and other methods are used to determine the winner, such as scorecard count-back, whereby the player with the lowest cumulative score over the last 18, 9, 6, 3 or 1 hole(s) is declared the winner.\nIn 1976, the Pepsi-Wilson Tournament on the Japan Golf Tour, set a record for the longest sudden-death playoff on any men's professional tour. It took Peter Thomson 14 holes to defeat Graham Marsh, Brian Jones and Shozo Miyamoto. This record still stands today.\nSudden death.\nSudden death is the most common playoff format in stroke play tournaments and even more so in match play tournaments. The tied participants play one extra hole at a time, with those still tied for the lowest score moving on to the next hole until a winner has been determined. All regular PGA Tour and European Tour tournaments use this system (except for The Players Championship starting in 2014), as does the Masters Tournament. The PGA Championship also used the sudden death format from 1977 to 1999. A player who wins in matchplay after \"n\" playoff holes is said to have won \"at the \"(18+n)\"th hole\" — or \"\"(36+n)\"th hole\" in the increasingly rare case of a 36-hole match.\nMany supporters, including veteran golfer Kenny Perry, support this type of play, feeling that it is best to let momentum decide the match. Tiger Woods, when interviewed immediately after his 2008 U.S. Open victory at Torrey Pines, stated that \"as a player who's playing well, you want to go more holes. The better player usually wins in more holes. That's how I've always approached it. The more holes you give me, if I'm playing well, I want more holes. Not just one hole, or even three.\" Others, such as professional golfer Chris DiMarco, claim that it is not fair to gruel through 72 holes and lose the tournament on one bad swing in sudden death.\nAggregate playoff.\nThe aggregate playoff is the oldest playoff format in strokeplay tournaments, with the lowest cumulative score in a series of holes, most commonly three, four, or eighteen holes. This is widely considered to be the fairest way of deciding a winner, as one bad shot does not eliminate all chances of winning, and is used in the four men's major championships. One flaw of this system is shorter variants, used in two majors and The Players Championship, held immediately after the tournament, take longer to complete than sudden death, meaning that a tournament may risk not being over before sunset. In contrast, a full 18-hole playoff is held the next day. Should there still be a tie after the set number of holes, then sudden death is normally played.\nThe four men's majors originally used an 18-hole (or 36-hole) format. The men's U.S. Open changed in 2018 to a two-hole aggregate playoff. The Open Championship used this format until 1985, when it was reduced to four holes. The three-hole format is used for the men's PGA Championship (originally 18 holes, changed to sudden death in 1977, and adopted the three hole in 2000), The Players Championship, and the other three USGA-sanctioned tournaments for professionals, the U.S. Women's Open, U.S. Senior Open (both were 18-hole playoffs before shortened to three in 2007, and two in 2018), and the U.S. Senior Women's Open. The Masters Tournament used the 18-hole format until 1976 (the first sudden-death playoff was in 1979). The first playoff in The Masters in 1935 was contested over 36 holes, when Gene Sarazen overcame Craig Wood.\nThe Open Championship was the first major tournament to adopt the shortened aggregate playoff system when a 4-hole playoff was introduced in 1985. However it was not invoked until Mark Calcavecchia, Greg Norman and Wayne Grady tied at Royal Troon in 1989. Calcavecchia came out on top to win his only major title. Since 2000, the PGA Championship has made use of a 3-hole playoff, having previously used sudden death. Three-hole playoffs were expected to be used in the 2016 Summer Olympics if there were a tie in medal positions, but were not necessary. The 2020 Summer Olympics tournament playoffs used sudden death to break medal ties."

        "title": "Carnoustie Golf Links",
        "text": "Carnoustie Golf Links is in Carnoustie, Angus, Scotland. Carnoustie has four courses – the historic Championship Course, the Burnside Course, the Buddon Links Course and a free-to-play short, five-hole course called The Nestie. Carnoustie Golf Links is one of the venues in the Open Championship rotation and has hosted golf's oldest major on eight occasions (1931, 1937, 1953, 1968, 1975, 1999, 2007, 2018), as well as the Senior Open Championship in 2010 and 2016 and the Women's British Open in 2011 and 2021.\nHistory.\nGolf is recorded as having been played at Carnoustie in the early 16th century. In 1890, the 14th Earl of Dalhousie, who owned the land, sold the links to the local authority. It had no funds to acquire the property, and public fundraising was undertaken and donated to the council. The original course was of ten holes, crossing and recrossing the Barry Burn; it was designed by Allan Robertson, assisted by Old Tom Morris, and opened in 1842. The opening of the coastal railway from Dundee to Arbroath in 1838 brought an influx of golfers from as far afield as Edinburgh, anxious to tackle the ancient links. This led to a complete restructuring of the course, extended in 1867 by Old Tom Morris to the 18 holes which had meanwhile become standardized. Young Tom Morris won a major open event there that same year. Two additional courses have since been added: the Burnside Course and the shorter though equally testing Buddon Links.\nCarnoustie first played host to The Open Championship in 1931, after modifications to the course by James Braid in 1926. The winner then was Tommy Armour, from Edinburgh.\nLater Open winners at Carnoustie include Henry Cotton of England in 1937, Ben Hogan of the USA in 1953, Gary Player of South Africa in 1968, Tom Watson of the USA in 1975, Paul Lawrie of Scotland in 1999, Pádraig Harrington of Ireland in 2007 and Francesco Molinari of Italy in 2018. The 1975, 1999 and 2007 editions were all won in playoffs.\nThe Championship course was modified significantly (but kept its routing used since 1926) prior to the 1999 Open, with all bunkers being rebuilt, many bunkers both added and eliminated, many green complexes expanded and enhanced, and several new tees being built. A large hotel was also built behind the 18th green of the Championship course.\nThe Amateur Championship was first hosted by Carnoustie in 1947; the winner was Willie Turnesa. The world's oldest amateur event has returned three times since: 1966 (won by Bobby Cole), 1971 (won by Steve Melnyk), and 1992 (won by Stephen Dundas).\nThe British Ladies Amateur was first hosted by Carnoustie in 1973, and also in 2012.\nThe Senior Open Championship was held at Carnoustie for the first time in 2010, with Germany's Bernhard Langer winning. The Women's British Open was held here for the first time in 2011; the winner was Yani Tseng.\nCarnoustie is one of the three courses hosting the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, an autumn event on the European Tour; the others are the Old Course at St Andrews and Kingsbarns.\nThe Golf Channel's reality series \"The Big Break\", in which aspiring golfers compete for exemptions on professional tours and other prizes, filmed at Carnoustie in 2005. As that year also saw the Ryder Cup at The K Club in Ireland, that year's show was based around a US v Europe theme, with the two teams competing for European Tour exemptions.\nIn North America, the course is nicknamed \"Car-nasty,\" due to its famous difficulty, especially under adverse weather conditions. Carnoustie is considered to be the most difficult course in the Open rota, and one of the toughest courses in the world.\nThe 1999 Open Championship is best remembered for the collapse of French golfer Jean van de Velde, who needed only a double-bogey six on the 72nd hole to win the Open—and proceeded to score a triple-bogey seven, tying Paul Lawrie and 1997 champion Justin Leonard at 290 (+6). Lawrie won the four-hole aggregate playoff and the championship.\nThe Open Championship was once again contested at Carnoustie in July 2007. The eight-year absence was far shorter than the lengthy 24 years it took to return to Carnoustie, between 1975 and 1999. Harrington triumphed over García in a four-hole playoff. The 18th hole once again proved itself among the most dramatic and exciting in championship golf. Harrington had a one-shot lead over García as he approached the final hole in the fourth round, but proceeded to put not one but two shots into the Barry Burn, on his way to a double-bogey 6. García, playing in the final pairing of the day, reached the 18th with a one-shot lead over Harrington, but bogeyed the hole after missing a putt from just under ten feet away, setting up the playoff. In the four-hole playoff, which ended on the 18th, Harrington took no chances with a two-shot lead on the 18th; his bogey was enough to defeat García by one shot.\nThe Open Championship returned to Carnoustie in 2018, where Francesco Molinari became the first Italian major winner, and Europe's third consecutive Open champion at Carnoustie. Molinari's final round was a bogey-free 69, which saw off challenges from several players including past champions Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\nOn 17 January 2014, Carnoustie Golf Links appointed its first-ever female chairman, Pat Sawers.\nCarnoustie Golf Links won the title of World's Best Golf Course 2019 at the World Golf Awards, Abu Dhabi.\nThe Open Championship.\nThis is a list of The Open Championship champions at Carnoustie Golf Links:\nThe Women's British Open.\nWinners of the Women's British Open at Carnoustie Golf Links.\nThe Senior Open.\nWinner of The Senior Open Championship at Carnoustie Golf Links.\nCourse.\nChampionship Course.\nChampionship scorecard (as of August 2021): \nLengths of the course for previous Opens (since 1930):\nLength of the course for Women's British Open\nLength of the course for Senior Open Championship"

        "title": "Blind cricket",
        "text": "Blind cricket is a version of the sport of cricket adapted for blind and partially sighted players. It has been governed by the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) since 16. So far, five Blind World Cups have been held: New Delhi, India (1998); Chennai, India (2002); Islamabad, Pakistan (2006), and India (2018). In 2012, the first Blind World Cup T20 was held in Bangalore, India. Blind cricket relies on common use of the 'sweep shot', in order to provide maximum chance of the bat hitting the ball.\nHistory.\nBlind cricket was invented in Melbourne in 1922 by two blind factory workers who improvised the game using a tin can containing rocks. The Victorian Blind Cricket Association was founded shortly after, in 1922, and the first sports ground and clubhouse for blind cricket was built at Kooyong, Melbourne in 1928.\nThe world's first test cricket match for the blind was played in 2000 between Pakistan and South Africa, in which Pakistan defeated South Africa by 94 runs.\nSouth Africa won the first world championship in 1998, defeating Pakistan in the finals; Pakistan consecutively won the next two championships, defeating South Africa and India in the finals in 2002 and 2006. In 2014, the championship was won by India, defeating the two-time winner Pakistan.\nRules.\nThe rules of blind cricket are based on the standard laws of cricket with some essential modifications.\nWBCC international playing rules are codified in 25 clauses, first ratified in 2005.\nThere are a total number of 11 players in each team: at least four players who are totally blind (classified as B1) and three partially blind players (B2), and up to four partially sighted players (B3).\nIn terms of playing equipment, the major adaptation is the ball, which is significantly larger than a standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings to provide audible cues. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it. The wicket (stumps) is also larger, made of metal tubes painted in fluorescent colours, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players to touch it in order to correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling.\nVarious other modifications to the rules apply. Verbal signals are widely used both by umpires and players: in particular, the bowler must shout 'Play!' as he releases the ball. The delivery is required to pitch at least twice when bowled to a completely blind batsman (once when bowled to a partially sighted batsman), but must not be rolling. Totally blind batsmen cannot be out due to being stumped, and must be found to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce.\nWorld Blind Cricket Council (WBCC).\nThe WBCC was established in 1996 during an international cricket meeting held in New Delhi, India in September 1996. The WBCC was set up with the objective of promoting and administering the game of blind cricket globally.\nToday the WBCC has 10 full members namely Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and Nepal.\nGeorge Abraham of India is the founding Chairman of the WBCC. Under his leadership, the inaugural Blind Cricket World Cup was held in New Delhi in November 1998. Seven countries participated.\nPeter Donovan of Australia took over as chairman in 2004. In November 2008, George Abraham was re-elected as president of the WBCC.\nBlind Cricket World Cup.\nThe first World Cup Cricket for the blind competition was held in New Delhi, India. The tournament was named &amp; designated as, \"Kanishka World Cup Cricket for the Blind\", because of the sponsorship by Hotel Kanishka of Ministry of Tourism Government of India, as informed by the then Director Administration, Retd. Lt. Col Sardev Singh from the Indian Army and his daughter Rakhee who was volunteering for this tournament. Further to this, a major portion of the expenses for stay &amp; important events held for all the teams; management /players were borne by Hotel Kanishka. A suite was also provided for meetings &amp; management to work from within the hotel. The match resulted in South Africa winning against Pakistan in the final. India and Australia were the two semi-finalists.\nThe second World Cup was held in Chennai, India in December. Pakistan defeated South Africa in the finals.\nThe third World Cup was held in Islamabad, Pakistan defeated India, under the leadership of Aga Shaukat-Ali, the founder of Pakistan Blind Cricket Council.\nOn 7 December 2014, India defeated Pakistan in the final at Cape Town, South Africa.\nOn 20 January 2018, India defeated Pakistan in the final at Sharjah.\nT20 Blind Cricket World Cup.\nThe first T20 Blind Cricket World Cup was held at Aditya Academy Ground in Bangalore, India in 2012. India defeated Pakistan by 29 runs in the final.\nOn 12 February 2017, India defeated Pakistan in the final at Bengaluru, India.\nOn 17 December 2022, India defeated Bangladesh at Bengaluru, India.\nRegional organizations.\nBritish Blind Sport.\nThe founding members of the British Blind Sport organisation were cricketers, and the association is the administrative body for the sport within the United Kingdom.\nBlind Cricket New South Wales (BCNSW).\nBlind Cricket New South Wales (BCNSW) is the home of blind cricket in New South Wales.\nCricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI).\nStarting 2011, Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI) is in place of Association for Cricket for the Blind India (ACBI) set up in 1996. George Abraham is the founder of the registered voluntary body. Its objectives are to use competitive cricket to teach the blind to look at life positively, gain in confidence and strive to be winners rather than dependents; and to use the game as a medium to transmit the message of ability and talent to the society. The ACBI organised the first two Blind Cricket World Cups in 1998 and 2002.\nCABI is the apex body that organizes and conducts cricket for blind across India. CABI is a sports initiative of Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled. It is a registered Non Profit Organization, affiliated to the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC). Conferred the hosting rights of the First Ever T – 20 World Cup in Bangalore in November /December 2012.\nThe primary goal of CABI:\nPakistan Blind Cricket Council (PBCC).\nIn 1997, Agha Shoukat Ali laid the foundation for the development of cricket for the blind in Pakistan named 'Pakistan Blind Cricket Council' (PBCC). Agha Shoukat Ali, the founder and life and soul of cricket for the blind in Pakistan, also represented the country in August 1996 the first International Conference on Cricket for the Blind which was held in Delhi, India, in which seven countries from all over the World participated. The Pakistan Blind Cricket Council is registered and affiliated with the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) and is its permanent member. The PBCC attends all the International Conferences and is playing its part practically.\nFrom 1997 onwards many registered clubs have come into existence and are affiliated with the Pakistan Blind Cricket Council. Cricket is now played regularly in schools among the blind. Tournaments are regularly organized in different cities of the country so that the blind may be able to meet, exchange information and have some fun. Rules similar to 'sighted cricket' are observed for cricket for the blind whenever it is played and efforts are being made to spread this all over the country.\nIn 2002 Government of Punjab allocated 45 Kanal space for the construction of Cricket stadium and facilities for PBCC. On construction it will be the first Cricket stadium built for Blind Cricketers.\nVictorian Blind Cricket Association (VBCA).\nThe Victorian Blind Cricket Association (VBCA) is the home of blind cricket in Victoria. Blind cricket was invented in Melbourne in 1922. The world's first sports ground and clubhouse for blind people was developed at Kooyong, Victoria in 1928 and is still used today as the home of the VBCA.\nThe Association now has four clubs with approximately 70 vision-impaired and blind members and several volunteers.\nCurrent clubs:\nThe Victorian Blind Cricket Association is located in the Charlie Bradley Pavilion, at the rear of 454 Glenferrie Road, Kooyong VIC 3144 (opposite the Kooyong Tennis Stadium Kooyong Stadium). Games are played on Saturday afternoons from October through to March and spectators are most welcome.\nThe VBCA provides an important role in the community by developing and providing opportunities for people who are blind or vision impaired to enjoy the recreational and social benefits of cricket. Additionally, the VBCA participates in cricket matches against sighted opposition in keeping with the philosophy of integration and working to remove barriers and isolating influences of having limited vision.\nThe ongoing aims and objectives of the VBCA are as follows:\nRegional competitions.\nAustralia.\nBlind cricket is widely played in Australia, with teams playing regular fixtures in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, as well as in the Australian Capital Territory. Every two years State cricket teams meet for the Australian Blind Cricket Championships. The 31st National Blind Cricket Championships was held in Queensland in 2012.\nEngland v Australia.\nThe first blind cricket \"Ashes\" competition was held in England in August 2004. Five one-day matches were played, with England winning the Ashes by three games to two. \nA return series of five matches was held in Sydney, Australia, in December 2008, resulting in a controversial 3–0 victory for England. Australia was victorious in a 2012 contest but England regained the ascendancy in 2016.\nIndia.\nSamarthanam Trust for the Disabled &amp; Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI organizes state, zonal, national and international level cricket tournaments for the blind. The state level cricket tournaments are organized to select the best state team to participate in their respective zones (north, east, west and south). Zonal matches are held by Samarthanam and CABI by identifying local partners, including private and government bodies which affiliate with the organizers, lending their support to the tournament. The winners of the zonal matches play league matches to qualify for the finals.\nPakistan.\nThe first regular match for the blind was played in Karachi in 1978 between Lahore and IDA RIEU School, Karachi. During this period several matches were played at school level.\nThe PBCC has organized eight (8) major National Tournaments besides Two Double-Wicket Tournaments since it is established in 1997.\nSouth Africa.\nBlind Cricket South Africa (BCSA) is the governing body for blind cricket in South Africa. It was founded in 2008 with the aim of promoting and developing the sport of cricket for the blind and visually impaired in the country.\nThe organization oversees regional activities throughout the country, including in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, and the Free State. These regional activities include leagues, tournaments, and training programs for blind and visually impaired cricketers.\nBlind cricket in South Africa has grown significantly since the formation of BCSA, with increasing numbers of players and teams participating in regional and national competitions. The organization has also established partnerships with other cricketing bodies, including Cricket South Africa, to further promote the sport.\nIn addition to its regional activities, BCSA has also participated in international blind cricket tournaments, including the T20 World Cup Cricket for the Blind.

        "text": "Silver King (January 11, 1868 – May 21, 1938), born Charles Frederick Koenig, was an American Major League Baseball player from 1886 through 1897. During his ten-year career, spent primarily as a pitcher, King played for the Kansas City Cowboys (1886), St. Louis Browns (1887–1889), Chicago Pirates (1890), Pittsburgh Pirates (1891), New York Giants (1892–93), Cincinnati Reds (1893), and Washington Senators (1896–97). \nNewspapers in St. Louis, Missouri, gave him the nickname Silver King, referring to his prematurely gray hair and shortening his German surname.\nEarly life.\nA native of St. Louis, Koenig broke into baseball at age 18, playing for St. Joseph in the Western League.\nCareer.\nKing was an unusual pitcher for his time. Gripping the ball with unusually large hands, he delivered the ball without a windup. He was also one of the first pitchers in major league history to employ a sidearm delivery. The unconventional methods worked, as he went on to pitch 3,190 innings, winning 203 games with 1229 strikeouts and a 3.18 earned run average in 397 games. His strong fastball enabled him to become a notable strikeout artist; he finished among the league's top 10 in that category six times.\nKing's best season came in 1888, when he led the Browns to their fourth consecutive American Association championship. That year, King led the league with 585 innings pitched in 66 games, 45 wins, and a 1.64 ERA. In 1890, he jumped to Chicago of the Players' League and added another ERA title while winning 30 games. On June 21, 1890, King threw a no-hitter for Chicago, the only one in the league's one-year history. (King lost 1–0, and pitched only eight innings in the loss, so this game is not officially recognized by MLB as a no-hitter.)\nPersonal life and death.\nAfter baseball, King returned to St. Louis. and went to work for his father's business.\nHe died in 1938, at age 70, and was buried at New St. Marcus Cemetery in St. Louis.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

        "text": "The Denmark national cricket team () represents Denmark in international cricket. They have been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1966, and have previously been a part of the ICC's High Performance Programme.\nDenmark played in the inaugural edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League, starting in August 2019, as a result of finishing in Division Three of the now defunct World Cricket League.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nCricket has been played in Denmark since the mid-19th century, with the first club being formed in 1865 by English railway engineers. The first organised match was played the following year between two teams of English players, with the first matches involving Danish players taking place in 1866. The game expanded greatly over the following twenty years, with 30 new clubs being formed in 1883.\nSeveral touring sides from England and Scotland visited the country in the early part of the 20th century, including the famous Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1933, an attempt to organise the first international match against the Netherlands failed, and the Danish national side did not play their first match until 1954, against Oxford University, the year after the current Danish Cricket Federation was formed.\nThey then began to play against other national sides, primarily the Netherlands, who they first played in 1955. They played their first match against Scotland in 1961.\nICC membership.\nDenmark became an associate member of the ICC in 1966, drawing their international against Scotland that year. They played Bermuda for the first time in 1969 and drew their first match against Ireland in 1970. They finally picked up their first international win against the Netherlands in 1972.\nThey played their first matches against Canada in 1974, losing a three-day match but winning the limited overs match. They played home internationals against East Africa and Sri Lanka, beating East Africa. They toured East Africa the following year, drawing with both East Africa and Kenya.\nThey took part in the first ICC Trophy in 1979, reaching the semi-final where they lost to Sri Lanka. They did not take part in the 1982 tournament. In 1983, Ole Mortensen became the first Danish player to play county cricket. Denmark returned to the ICC Trophy in 1986 and finished third after beating Bermuda in the third place play-off.\nIn 1989, Denmark hosted Australia for two one-day matches. They lost the first match in Brøndby by 45 runs and lost the second in Copenhagen by 54 runs. They fared better at home against Canada that year, winning twice against them. After playing both home and away against Bangladesh in 1990, they played in the ICC Trophy, reaching the second round.\nDenmark again played in the ICC Trophy in 1994, finishing tenth in the tournament after losing to Namibia in the plate final. They played their first matches against France in 1995, and hosted the first European Cricket Championship in 1996, finishing third. They finished fifth in the following years ICC Trophy and were runners up in the European Championship in 1998.\nIn 1999, Denmark took part in the NatWest Trophy for the first time. The following year, they took part in the ICC Emerging Nations Tournament in Zimbabwe, where they finished fourth, and the European Championship, where they finished last, without winning a game. The following year, they took part in the ICC Trophy in Canada, finishing eighth. The MCC toured Denmark in 2002, and Denmark won all three matches. They won just one match at that year's European Championship, finishing fifth ahead of Italy.\n2000-2017.\nThe Netherlands visited Denmark in 2003, winning both matches. Denmark played a two match series against Ireland later in the year, losing both matches and missing out on qualification for the ICC Intercontinental Cup. They again finished last in the European Championship the following year. In 2005, they played their final match in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy, losing heavily to Northamptonshire at Svanholm Park before taking part in the 2005 ICC Trophy, where they again finished eighth.\nIn 2006, Denmark again took part in the European Championship, finishing fourth after winning only against Italy. At the end of that year, it was announced that they would join the ICC's High Performance Programme from 1 April 2007.\nIn August 2007, Denmark registered a win over Bermuda, an ODI playing country, and towards the end of October 2007 they played in Kenya against domestic teams and Kenya A. Denmark, led by Freddie Klokker who scored consecutive centuries in all their matches, clean swept the Kenyan sides and Kenya A. Denmark bowled, batted and fielded exceptionally well.\nIn November 2007, Denmark took part in Division Two of the World Cricket League. In finishing fourth, they qualified to compete in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. However, they eventually came last of the twelve teams, meaning they were relegated to Division Three of the World Cricket League. They next competed in the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 5th to be relegated to the Division Four.\nIn November 2013, they competed in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE where they finished in last place, failing to win a game.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Denmark and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nIn September 2018, Denmark qualified from Group A of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier to the Regional Finals of the tournament.\nDenmark played their first T20I match against Jersey on 16 June 2019.\nSince April 2019, Denmark has played in the 2019–2022 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the active players who have played for the Denmark in the past 12 months and the forms in which they have played, or any players who have been selected in the team's most recent List A or T20 squad.

        "title": "Golf at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Golf is officially recognized as first featuring in the Summer Olympic Games programme in 1900 and 1904, although the 1900 events were not regarded as being part of the games at the time. A golf tournament was to have been held in 1908, but it was cancelled less than two days before it was scheduled to start. Two golf tournaments were also to have been held in 1920, but were cancelled due to a lack of entries.\nAt the IOC session in Copenhagen in October 2009, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to reinstate the sport for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The International Golf Federation is the governing body for golf at the Olympic Games. Qualification is based primarily upon the Official World Golf Ranking (men) and Women's World Golf Rankings, with the top 15 of each gender automatically qualifying (with a limit of four per country), and then the highest ranked players from countries that had not yet already qualified two players.\nMedal table.\nSources:\nEvents.\nA men's individual tournament was planned for the 1908 London Games, but a dispute amongst representatives of England and Scotland over the format led to British golfers boycotting, leaving 1904 gold medallist George Lyon of Canada as the only remaining entrant. He was entitled to claim the gold medal but declined.\nTwo golf tournaments were planned at the 1920 Antwerp Games, but were cancelled due to a lack of entries.\nSince its reintroduction, Olympic golf competitions have consisted of men's and women's individual stroke play. There has been calls for the IGF and the IOC to consider adding a match play tournament, a team tournament, and/or to open up the Olympic tournament to more golfers, possibly by using a different qualifying system than the World Golf Ranking.\nParticipating nations.\n22 golfers competed in 1900. The 1904 tournament featured 77 golfers. Albert Lambert was the only golfer who competed both times; a total of 98 different golfers competed throughout the brief history of Olympic golf before it was brought back in 2016."

        "title": "Clifford Robinson (basketball, born 1966)",
        "text": "Clifford Ralph Robinson (December 16, 1966August 29, 2020) was an American professional basketball player who played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Selected in the second round of the 1989 NBA draft, he played the first eight seasons of his career with the Portland Trail Blazers, followed by stints with the Phoenix Suns, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, and New Jersey Nets. Robinson received the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1993 and was selected as an NBA All-Star in 1994. He played college basketball for the UConn Huskies.\nCollege basketball career.\nRobinson played four seasons at the University of Connecticut beginning in 1985. The Huskies won the 1988 National Invitation Tournament championship, and he was named to the all-tournament team. Robinson was later named to UConn's All-Century men's basketball team. On February 5, 2007, Robinson's number \"00\" was retired at Gampel Pavilion during halftime of a UConn basketball game against Syracuse as part of the \"Huskies of Honor\" ceremony which recognized personal accomplishments of 13 former players and 3 coaches.\nProfessional basketball career.\nPortland Trail Blazers (1989–1997).\nRobinson was selected with the 36th overall pick in the second round of the 1989 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. Robinson played for the Trail Blazers for eight seasons. Portland made the playoffs each year he was on the team, and played in the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. Robinson won the Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1992–93 after averaging 19.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and a career-best 1.99 blocks per game. He was an All-Star with the team in 1994. Following Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference finals against the Utah Jazz, Robinson performed a victory dance that he later told press was named the \"Uncle Cliffy\". The nickname stuck with Robinson for the rest of his career. Following a game against the Golden State Warriors on February 22, 1995, Robinson was forced to end his 461 iron man streak of consecutive games played since the start of his career. This streak stands as a franchise record for the Trail Blazers.\nPhoenix Suns (1997–2001).\nRobinson signed with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent on August 25, 1997, where he remained for four more seasons. The highlight of his tenure with the Suns was registering a career-best 50 points against the Denver Nuggets on January 16, 2000. He became the oldest player in NBA history to register his first 50-point game, aged 33 years and 2 months.\nDetroit Pistons (2001–2003).\nRobinson was traded to the Detroit Pistons on June 29, 2001, in exchange for Jud Buechler and John Wallace.\nGolden State Warriors (2003–2005).\nRobinson was traded to the Golden State Warriors on August 21, 2003, along with Pepe Sánchez, in exchange for Bob Sura. Although he played all 82 games during the regular season, it would be the first season in his career where he would not participate in the NBA playoffs.\nNew Jersey Nets (2005–2007).\nOn February 14, 2005, Golden State traded Robinson to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks. He played with the Nets for two more seasons until he was released by the team in July 2007. Robinson then retired.\nSuspensions.\nRobinson was arrested for marijuana possession and driving under the influence in February 2001 and received a one-game suspension. Robinson was also suspended for five games in February 2005 while playing for Golden State, and was suspended for five games during the NBA playoffs on May 12, 2006 for violating terms of the league's drug policy for the second time in two seasons.\nRetrospective.\nRobinson held career NBA per-game averages of 14.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.05 steals, and 1.03 blocks. As of March 2024, his 1,380 NBA games played is the 14th-highest total in NBA history. \nRobinson was one of only two players drafted in the 1980s that was still active in the league in 2007, with the other being Kevin Willis. He played in the NBA playoffs in all but one of his 18 seasons in the league. \nAt 6'10\", he was the tallest player to make more than 1,000 three-pointers until he was surpassed by Dirk Nowitzki and Rashard Lewis. As of 2019, Robinson was one of seven players to record 1,300 steals and 1,300 blocked shots in his ABA/NBA career; the others are Kevin Garnett, Julius Erving, Bobby Jones, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson and Ben Wallace.\nPost-NBA endeavors.\n\"Survivor\".\nRobinson was a contestant in the of the American reality television series \"Survivor\" (filmed in 2013 and broadcast the following year). Although he did not initially plan to reveal his identity, he was recognized by another contestant. He was the fifth contestant of the season to be voted out, finishing in 14th place.\nBasketball diplomacy.\nIn 2014, Robinson was named to a team assembled by Dennis Rodman as part of his \"basketball diplomacy\" effort in North Korea with the job of playing an exhibition match against the Northern Korean Senior National Basketball Team to celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong-un. The team also included Kenny Anderson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, Sleepy Floyd, Charles D. Smith, and four \"streetballers\".\nCannabis entrepreneurship.\nDuring his post-basketball life, Robinson became an entrepreneur in the cannabis industry, selling assorted cannabis products under his \"Uncle Cliffy\" brand name. He was also an advocate for the legalization of cannabis, supporting efforts to reform cannabis laws in the states of Oregon and Connecticut. During his time in the NBA, Robinson used cannabis to help relieve pain and anxiety, and to avoid the undesirable side effects caused by pharmaceutical drugs. He partially attributed the longevity of his NBA career to his use of cannabis.\nRobinson appeared in the 2019 Netflix film \"Grass Is Greener\", which examines the history of cannabis prohibition in the United States.\nPersonal life.\nOn September 21, 2003, Robinson married Heather Lufkins on the island of Barbados. His son Isaiah Robinson played basketball for the Jefferson High School Democrats in Portland and for the Houston Baptist Huskies.\nHealth issues and death.\nRobinson suffered a stroke in March 2017 that paralyzed the left side of his body, but he soon recovered much of his arm and leg movement. He had a tumor removed from his jaw in March 2018.\nIn March 2019, Robinson underwent surgery for cancer. He died of lymphoma on August 29, 2020, at the age of 53."

        "title": "1957 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1957 Tour de France was the 44th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 27 June to 20 July. It was composed of 22 stages over .\nThe 1957 Tour was the first win for Jacques Anquetil, who won the Tour five times over his career.\nThe French national team was very successful in the 1957 Tour de France; not only did they provide the winning cyclist, they also won the team classification, and almost every daily team classification. They lost only one cyclist (the previous year's winner Roger Walkowiak), and had the stage winner 12 times. They had Forestier winning the points classification, and Bergaud second in the mountains classification. Only once they did not have the yellow jersey for the leader in the general classification, when Barone took it after the seventh stage.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe Tour organisation had a conflict with the French television, and as a results there had almost been no live television coverage of the 1957 Tour de France. At the last moment the organisers and the television agreed on how much the television would pay for the right to cover the Tour, and the race was broadcast.\nFor the other journalist, the conditions improved: a mobile press room with modern communication equipment was installed, so the journalists had the best conditions to report.\nThe cut-off time, which had been set at 10% of the winner in 1956, was reduced to 8% of the winner in 1957. In the seventh and eighth stage it would be 10% of the winner, while in stages 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18 the cut-off time would be 12% of the winner. In each stage, if the number of cyclists removed from the race would be more than 15% of the cyclists that started the stage, the cut-off time would be increased by 2%. The goal of this reduction in cut-off time was to make the race tougher.\nFor the first time since the introduction of the national team format in 1930, the riders were allowed to have advertising on their jerseys.\nTeams.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe route of the 1957 Tour de France contained many mountains, so mountain specialists Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes were considered favourites. Gaul, had requested to ride in the Dutch team, but this was not allowed.\nLouison Bobet and Raphael Géminiani, two important French cyclists, did not race in 1957, so the French team needed new stars. The team was then built around young Jacques Anquetil, who had broken the hour record earlier that year.\nThe riders who had been favourites in previous years had stopped (Fausto Coppi), had lost their greatness (Hugo Koblet), or had chosen not to participate (Louison Bobet). As a result, there was no outspoken favourite.\nRoger Walkowiak, who had won the previous edition, had not shown good results since. Charly Gaul had lost the 1957 Giro d'Italia when he was almost sure of winning it, so he was not considered to be in great form. Gastone Nencini, who won the 1957 Giro, was not considered constant enough. The Spanish team was considered the best Spanish team ever, but they were more favourite for the mountain classification than for the general classification. And the Belgian team was focussed around Jan Adriaensens.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1957 Tour de France started on 27 June, and had two rest days, in Thonon-les-Bains and Barcelona, although the second rest day had a short time trial of less than 10 km. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 10.\nEvery stage had a winning cyclist (the cyclist who crossed the finish line first, or in case of a time trial who took the shortest time to complete the course) and a team that wins the daily team classification (the team of which the three best cyclists had the lowest accumulated time). The cyclist who wins the stage therefore is not always part of the team that wins the daily team classification. In 1957, the split stages were numbered differently: the third stage consisted of the team time trial and the stage from Caen to Rouen but they were not called 3a and 3b; the fifteenth stage was only the stage from Perpignan to Barcelona, and the short individual time trial was referred to as the time trial between stage 15 and 16, without number.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by André Darrigade, who had also won the first stage in the previous edition. The first stages were run in hot weather, and many cyclists had to give up. After six stages, there were only 83 cyclists remaining, from the 120 that started.\nIn the second stage, Darrigade's teammate Privat took over the yellow jersey. The Luxembourg favourite, Charly Gaul, abandoned on that stage due to sickness.\nIn the fifth stage, French cyclist Jacques Anquetil took the lead in the general classification, so in the sixth stage he wore the yellow jersey for the first time in his career. It was too early in the race to defend that jersey, so two days later he allowed regional cyclist Nicolas Barone to take the yellow jersey. One day later the French national team took back the yellow jersey, when Jean Forestier took the lead by 15 minutes.\nIn the ninth stage, Spanish climber Bahamontes abandoned. In stage 10, the first mountain stage, Anquetil took the lead back. Although Gastone Nencini won the stage, Anquetil was only one and a half minute behind, which was enough. In the second mountain stage the riders remained calm, as the French team was superior and dominated the race.\nIn the second part of the fifteenth stage, a short time trial of 10 km, Anquetil won his first time trial in the Tour de France.\nIn the Pyrenées from stage 16 to stage 18, the attack on Anquetil's leading position did not take place. In stage 16, the weather had turned bad, with coldness, rain, hail and fog, which made the course dangerous. Several cyclists fell: Nello Lauredi broke his wrist and abandoned the race, and Stanislas Bober had to abandon due to a shoulder injury. The main victims of the bad weather were reporter Alex Virot and his motor cyclist René Wagner, who fell from their motor; Virot died on the spot, and the motor cyclist on the way to the hospital. It was the only accident that Wagner ever had in his career.\nBefore stage 18, the French team had the first three places in the general classification with Anquetil, Forestier and Mahé. In stage 18, the last mountain stage, Anquetil was in good shape, and he attacked early on. But in the food zone he missed his food bag, and some time later he was out of energy. Several cyclists passed him, but later in the stage Anquetil got help and finished only two and a half minutes after the winner Nencini.\nMarcel Janssens and Adolf Christian were in the leading group, while Forestier and Mahé lost considerable time, so Janssens and Christian took the podium places. Anquetil was still leading, and nobody doubted that he would win the race, especially because there was still an individual time trial coming up, Anquetil's specialty. And indeed, Anquetil won that time trial with a margin of more than two minutes.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 120 cyclists that started the 1957 Tour de France, 56 finished the race.\nThe points classification in 1957 was calculated in the same way as since the introduction in 1953, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1957, this was won by Jean Forestier with 301 points. Over 22 stages (including two split stages), this meant that his average stage finish was approximately place 14.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1956: there were three types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Gastone Nencini won this classification.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the French team, with a large margin over the Italian team. The Luxembourg/Mixed team finished with only one cyclist, so they were not included in the team classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.Nicolas Barone won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 12. This prize was won by Jean Stablinski.\nAftermath.\nJacques Anquetil would later win the Tour de France four more times.\nFrom 1960 to 1967, the \"Alex Virot award\" was given to the most loyal cyclist, named after the journalist who died during the 1957 Tour de France."

        "text": "Paul Dee Dean (August 14, 1912 – March 17, 1981), nicknamed \"Daffy\", was an American Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. Born in Lucas, Arkansas, he pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals (1934–1939), the New York Giants (1940–1941), and the St. Louis Browns (1943).\nDean played several years of baseball alongside his better-known brother, Jay. Because of his brother's nickname, \"Dizzy\", Dean also had a nickname, \"Daffy\", but this did not reflect his personality as he was considered quiet and serious. The nickname was mainly a creation of the press.\nDuring his rookie season (at the age of 22), Dean pitched a no-hitter on September 21, 1934, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Dizzy (who had pitched a three-hit shutout in the first game) would say afterwards: \"Shoot! If I'da known Paul was gonna pitch a no-hitter, I'da pitched me one too.\" Paul finished the year with a 19–11 record to help St. Louis win the National League pennant. Combined with his brother becoming the only NL pitcher in the live-ball era to win 30 games, the brothers bettered Dizzy's prediction that \"me 'n' Paul are gonna win 45 games\" by four wins. In the World Series, he and his brother won two games apiece, combining for a 4–1 record, 28 strikeouts and a 1.43 ERA, as the Cardinals took the series against the Detroit Tigers in seven games.\nThe following year, Dean won 19 games again. He got injured, however, and pitched ineffectively for the rest of his career.\nDean is featured prominently in some versions of Abbott &amp; Costello's Who's on First? comedy sketch. In the sketch Abbott is explaining to Costello that many ballplayers have unusual nicknames including Dizzy Dean, his brother Daffy Dean and their \"French cousin Goo-fay Dean\". The fictitious French cousin's name is \"goofy\" pronounced with an exaggerated French accent.\nDean served in the United States Army during World War II.\nDean died at age 68 in Springdale, Arkansas, from a heart attack.\nIn the 1952 biographical film about Dizzy Dean, \"The Pride of St Louis,\" Paul was portrayed by actor Richard Crenna."

        "text": "Golf Digest is a monthly golf magazine published by Warner Bros. Discovery through its TNT Sports unit. It is a generalist golf publication covering recreational golf and men's and women's competitive golf. The magazine started by John F. Barnett in 1950 in Chicago, moved to Connecticut in 1964 and was sold to The New York Times Company in 1969. The Times company sold their magazine division to Condé Nast in 2001. The headquarters of \"Golf Digest\" is in New York City relocated from Connecticut. On May 13, 2019, Discovery, Inc. acquired \"Golf Digest\" from Condé Nast, in order to integrate with GolfTV.\nCourse rankings.\n\"Golf Digest\" produces a biennial ranking of the world's best golf courses.\nSince 1965, \"Golf Digest\" has produced biennial rankings of \"America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses\". The courses are voted on by a panel of several hundred golf experts. The magazine also produces lists of the best new courses, the best golf resorts, the best courses in each U.S. state and best American golf courses for women. Before the \"Greatest\" rankings were introduced in 1985, \"Golf Digest\" produced lists called at different times \"America's 100 Most Testing Courses\" and \"America's 100 Greatest Tests of Golf\". Alongside the \"100 Greatest Courses\" ranking, and using the same methodology, \"Golf Digest\" publishes a list of \"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\". In this context, \"public\" means a golf course that is open to play by the public, as opposed to a private club—not necessarily a course operated by a governmental entity. In addition to its national rankings, \"Golf Digest\" also ranks courses at a state level.\nThe magazine also compiles a list of the leading courses outside the United States. This is created using information from national golf associations, plus votes by the same panelists supplemented by some additional ones with international knowledge.\nIn 2010, \"Golf Digest\" produced its inaugural ranking of \"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\". In creating the ranking, the magazine used nominations and evaluations by its panel of over 100 female raters as well as the woman-friendly criteria established by the editors. Those criteria included: at least one tee less than 5,300 yards; at least two sets of tees with USGA slope and course ratings for women; run-up areas to most or all greens and minimal forced carries for those playing from the forward tees.\nRecognition.\nIn 2009, \"Golf Digest\" was nominated for a National Magazine Awards by the American Society of Magazine Editors in the Magazine Section in recognition of the excellence of a regular section of a magazine based on voice, originality and unified presentation.\nFemale representation.\nIn April 2014, \"Golf Digest\" was widely criticized when, after neglecting to picture a female golfer on their cover for six years, they chose to picture model Paulina Gretzky in a revealing outfit as their May 2014 cover. The move was \"particularly frustrating\" to LPGA golfers. LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan issued a statement echoing the concerns expressed by LPGA players. In the October 2014 edition, U.S. Women's Open winner Michelle Wie appeared on the cover.\nIn May 2016, the magazine again featured a female celebrity in the cover, Paige Spiranac (who was, at the time, a professional golfer), which was criticized by veteran golfer Juli Inkster."

        "title": "International Basketball League",
        "text": "The International Basketball League (IBL) was a semi-professional men's basketball league featuring teams from the West Coast of the United States. In 2010 the Albany Legends became the first team in the Northeastern United States to join. The IBL also sometimes featured teams from China and Japan which temporarily relocated to the United States for the IBL season. The IBL season typically ran from the end of March through July.\nHistory.\nFounded by Portland area sports promoter Mikal Duilio, the league featured rules designed to create a fast-paced, high-scoring brand of basketball. Duilio first began planning for the league with a series of test games in Portland and Seattle in November 2003. These games featured a mixture of traditional college and NBA rules, plus two rules created specifically for the league:\nThe test games proved popular and resulted in the founding of the IBL in August 2004. Founded with eight teams, the league expanded to 17 by the start of the season in April 2005. Each team played approximately 20 regular season games, most of them centered on their home region, with the teams with the two best records playing in a championship game at the end of the season. The Battle Creek Knights won the inaugural title by going undefeated in the regular season and beating the Dayton Jets in the finals.\nIn the league's first year, the up-tempo rules resulted in the average team scoring 126.9 points per game, nearly 30 points more than the NBA team average in 2004–05, and slightly higher than the NBA record for points per game by a team in a single season, set by the Denver Nuggets in 1981–82.\nIn 2010, the league launched a winter season which saw nine different teams compete. Four teams played an entire schedule and thus made them eligible for the playoffs.\nIn July 2011, Duilio sold the league to Vancouver, Washington, businessman Bryan Hunter. Sharleen Graf was appointed as the league's new commissioner.\nIn March 2014 the IBL ceased operation as an independent entity and combined with the West Coast Basketball League (WCBL). Teams were split into an 'International Conference' and 'Continental Conference' based on geography. The owner of the NBA over the past decade has actively been internationalizing the game by recruiting potential international players and expanding overseas markets."

        "title": "2004 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2004 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 2003–04 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. This season's NBA Finals was contested between the Western Conference playoff champion Los Angeles Lakers and the Eastern Conference playoff champion Detroit Pistons. The Lakers held home court advantage, and the series was played under a best-of-seven format.\nAlthough the Lakers, headed by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, were considered the heavy favorites, the underdog Pistons handily won the series in five games. The series is commonly referred to as a \"five-game sweep\" due to the fact that Detroit dominated in each of their four wins while the Lakers barely managed to win Game 2 in overtime. This marked the Pistons' fifth championship victory overall as a franchise (including two NBL championships: in 1944 and 1945 as the Fort Wayne Pistons) as well as its first NBA title since two 1989–90 NBA championship seasons which was nearly fifteen years prior. The series ultimately featured the perceived underdog Pistons dominating a Lakers team composed of four future Hall of Famers.\nPistons' owner William Davidson became the first owner in American sports history to win two championships in one calendar year; eight days earlier, his Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames to win the NHL Stanley Cup Finals in seven games.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers had won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 but lost to the eventual champions, the San Antonio Spurs, in the Western Conference Semifinals in 2003 to end their streak at three. The Spurs beat the Lakers in 6 games.\nIn the 2003 offseason, the Lakers made major changes with initially varying results. Needing to find a point guard and a power forward to defend against Tim Duncan and the Spurs, the Lakers signed veteran stars Gary Payton and Karl Malone for well below market value; they also hoped to give both veterans their first championship ring. The Lakers were afterwards considered the favorites to win the NBA title.\nDuring the regular season, after starting the season 18–3, the Lakers were afflicted by numerous injuries and stumbled to a 56–26 record to finish the season with the second seed in the Western Conference.\nThe Lakers breezed past their first-round opponent, the Houston Rockets, headlining a matchup between Shaquille O'Neal and a young Yao Ming. They defeated the squad 4–1 but then lost the first two games in their series against the Spurs before a dramatic comeback that saw them win 4–2. They then faced the Minnesota Timberwolves and league MVP Kevin Garnett. The Lakers won the series 4–2 to advance to the Finals.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe Pistons won two back-to-back championships in 1989 and 1990, but with retirements and departures of several stars, they faded from relevance. The team hired former star Joe Dumars as general manager of the team in 2000, and he began stockpiling draft picks and trading players. He landed defensive stalwart Ben Wallace and guard Richard Hamilton by trading established stars in controversial trades, signed Chauncey Billups who was considered an underachiever, and drafted Tayshaun Prince with the 23rd pick in the 2002 draft. He was named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2003 for returning the Pistons to prominence.\nThe Pistons made another major—perhaps, riskier—coaching change, firing head coach Rick Carlisle, who had led the Pistons to consecutive Central Division titles, 100 regular season wins, and had received the NBA Coach of the Year Award in 2002. In his place, Dumars hired legendary coach Larry Brown, who had most recently led the Philadelphia 76ers to the NBA Finals in 2001 against the Lakers.\nIn a three-team trade involving the Boston Celtics and Atlanta Hawks at the trade deadline, Dumars traded Chucky Atkins, Lindsey Hunter, Bobby Sura, Željko Rebrača, and other considerations for guard Mike James and forward Rasheed Wallace, who had been traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Hawks and then to the Pistons at the trade deadline. They proved to be the final pieces of the championship team. Lindsey Hunter would rejoin the Pistons a week later after being waived by the Celtics and be partnered with Mike James to create a formidable guard tandem off the bench dubbed \"The Pit Bulls\". They became the first team in NBA history to hold five consecutive opponents under 70 points, and finished the season with a 54–28 record and the third seed in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Pistons easily overcame the Milwaukee Bucks 4–1 but struggled against the defending conference champion New Jersey Nets. After splitting the first four games of the series, the Nets won Game 5 in Detroit in triple overtime to take a 3–2 series lead back to New Jersey. After falling behind by 12 early in Game 6, the Pistons stormed back in the second quarter and held on for an 81-75 victory to force a seventh game. The Pistons never trailed after the midway point of the first quarter and cruised to a 90–69 win to take the series.\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, a match up with the 61-win, Carlisle-led Indiana Pacers, the Pistons faltered in the final 90 seconds of Game 1, falling 78–74. In Game 2, Rasheed Wallace almost squandered a Detroit lead. With Detroit clinging to a 69–67 lead with under 30 seconds to play, Billups recovered the basketball after a Jermaine O'Neal blocked shot of Rasheed Wallace. Jamaal Tinsley stripped Billups and found Reggie Miller open down the court for what appeared to be the tying lay-up. As Miller approached the basket, Tayshaun Prince ran in from the left wing and blocked Miller's lay-up as it left his fingertips. Richard Hamilton recovered the loose ball before it went out of bounds and was fouled by Tinsley. Hamilton would make three free throws in the game's final 15 seconds to seal the victory 72–67 and tie the series. The Pistons rode the momentum of Game 2, including dominant wins in Games 3 and 5, to a 4–2 series victory, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years.\nRegular season series.\nThe teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nThe Finals were played using a 2–3–2 site format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with home court advantage. This format was only used in the Finals; all other playoff series were held in a 2–2–1–1–1 format (the team with home court advantage starts).\nThe Pistons became the fourth team to sweep the middle three games since the NBA started using the 2-3-2 format in 1985, but the first to do so at home; the previous three times this had occurred, it was done by away teams (1990 Pistons, 1991 Chicago Bulls, 2001 Lakers). This feat would later be accomplished by two more teams (the 2006 and 2012 Miami Heat, both on their home floor) before the Finals reverted to 2-2-1-1-1 format in 2014.\nThis was the first Finals series to be played on a Sunday–Tuesday–Thursday rotation since 1990, the last year CBS had the NBA's national television contract. NBC switched to a Wednesday-Friday-Sunday rotation in 1991, which was used through 2003, save for Monday games in 1999 and 2000 (and a potential Tuesday game in 1999, had that Finals reached Game 7). It is also the last series to have Game 1 be played on a Sunday. Since 2005, Game 1 has been played on a Thursday each year, with the exceptions of 2011, 2012, 2020, and 2021.\nFeatures.\nThe NBA heavily publicized the series as it has done with all other NBA Finals series. There was a sentiment among fans that the Pistons were the clear underdogs, and many described the series as a David vs. Goliath match-up. The Lakers had a lineup of Stars such as Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O'Neal—their offensive capability was expected to overpower Detroit's defensive-based game plan.\nPayton and Malone also added to the publicity of the Finals. Perennial All-Stars who had both previously reached the Finals, Payton had led the Seattle SuperSonics there in 1996, while Malone had led the Utah Jazz there in 1997 and 1998. However, the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls denied them championship rings a total of three times. By the time of Jordan's second retirement in 1998, the two veterans were aged and failed to lead their teams deep into the playoffs. It would be Malone's final chance to win a championship, as he would retire before the subsequent season.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nConsidered to be a stunning upset by most of the NBA world, the Detroit Pistons managed to defeat the Lakers with imposing defense. Defensively clamping down on everyone but Bryant and O'Neal, the Pistons managed to hold everyone else to a total of 16 points. O'Neal recorded 34 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers.\nThe Pistons trailed the Lakers 41–40 at halftime, but by the fourth quarter the Pistons had opened up a 13-point lead; they would not trail for the rest of the game. The Pistons outscored the Lakers 47 to 34 in the 2nd half as they got the road win in Los Angeles. Chauncey Billups recorded 22 points, 4 assists, and 3 steals to fuel his team towards the win.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, the Lakers had an 8-point lead at halftime, 44–36. However, in the third quarter, the Pistons scored 30 points, cutting the deficit to 68–66. Detroit took the lead on a Lindsay Hunter three-pointer, 71–68. However, the Lakers went on a 7-0 run to regain the lead with 7:00 remaining in the fourth quarter. With 47 seconds remaining, Ben Wallace made a putback to give the Pistons a 6-point advantage. The next play, Kobe Bryant missed a 3-pointer but O'Neal was there to grab the offensive board and made an and-1 to cut the deficit to 3. The Pistons led by three points with 10.9 seconds remaining in the final period. Coach Brown wanted to foul a Lakers player where they could get only 2 points rather than 3. However, the Pistons' veterans only wanted to intentionally foul O'Neal. Kobe Bryant's 3-point shot with 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter would force overtime, where the Pistons would make only one two-point field goal (compared to Los Angeles scoring ten points). Afterwards, on the team bus back to the airport, Billups told the Pistons' players and coaches, \"We're not coming back to L.A.\"\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, the Pistons were on fire to start. They started the game on a 10–2 run. At halftime, the Pistons led by seven, 39–32. The Pistons beat Los Angeles by 20 in their first NBA Finals appearance together at The Palace of Auburn Hills since 1990 to take a 2–1 lead in the series. The 68 points scored by the Lakers set a franchise record for the lowest number of points scored in a playoff game. Tayshaun Prince and the Pistons' defense were able to hold Kobe Bryant to 11 points on 4/13 (.308%) shooting, with Bryant going scoreless in the first half.\nGame 4.\nAgain, the Pistons defeated the Lakers, although this time by eight, to take a 3–1 series advantage.\nO'Neal scored 36 for the Lakers and Bryant scored 20 but shot 32 percent from the field.\nKarl Malone would play his last game, as a knee injury would not allow him to dress in Game 5.\nGame 5.\nIn Game 5, the Pistons won their first championship since 1990, and Larry Brown finally won a professional title. The Pistons defense had overcome the high-scoring Laker offense, winning the game by 13, winning the series 4–1, and also ending a long Laker dynasty that lasted for many years. The Pistons' 100 points was the first (and only) time either team scored triple digits in the series. The game saw the end of Phil Jackson's first run as the coach—he returned in the 2005–06 season—and saw O'Neal, Payton, and Malone's last games in Laker uniforms.\nThis game also marked the end of Karl Malone's third and final attempt at winning an NBA championship. He went 0–3 in the NBA Finals.\nBroadcast notes.\nThe games were broadcast on ABC by Al Michaels and Doc Rivers. This was the first of two NBA Finals assignments for Michaels, better known as the voice of \"Monday Night Football\" at the time, while Rivers departed the booth after the series to become head coach of the Boston Celtics. Rivers was replaced by Hubie Brown the following season. Rivers would not return to the broadcast booth until 2023, where he and Doris Burke replaced Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson on the lead broadcast team alongside Mike Breen; Van Gundy and Jackson were laid off by the network after the 2023 NBA Finals. However, Rivers' second stint in the booth only lasted until January 2024 when the Milwaukee Bucks hired him as head coach.\nBrent Musburger and Jack Ramsay broadcast the Finals nationally on ESPN Radio. The finals were shown on Sky Sports in the UK and Ireland. In Canada, Leafs TV and RDS (in French) simulcast ABC, and Azteca 13 broadcast the Finals in Mexico.\nTo promote the series, the NBA used The Black Eyed Peas' song \"Let's Get It Started\", which it had also used throughout the 2004 NBA Playoffs.\nAftermath.\nThe Pistons won 54 games the following season, earning the second seed in the Eastern Conference. They returned to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. The Pistons would continue their run of Eastern Conference superiority in the ensuing three years; losing in the Conference Finals each time. After a particularly painful loss to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in the 2007-08 season, management would finally break up the core of the team and enter a period of losing seasons.\nThe Lakers' collapse became apparent in the days following the Finals. Head coach Phil Jackson abruptly resigned, Shaquille O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat, where he eventually won a championship in 2006; Gary Payton was dealt to the Celtics, and Karl Malone was left unsigned, which subsequently resulted in Malone's retirement following the start of 2004–05 NBA season. The 2004–05 season was a tough one for the Lakers as they won just 34 games and missed the playoffs. Jackson returned to the Lakers in the following offseason; despite penning a book dubiously entitled: \"\", in which he voiced disdain for Kobe Bryant; calling him 'uncoachable'. Jackson and Bryant would quickly bury the hatchet once the season began; the duo, in the ensuing years would appear in three more NBA Finals in 2008, 2009, and 2010, winning the latter two."

The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments. The ATP has used a computerized system for determining the rankings since August 23, 1973.

Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP, of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.\nThe current world number one is Novak Djokovic.\nRanking method.\nSince the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments. Lower-ranked players who are not eligible for some or all of the top tournaments may include additional ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, and also ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit tournaments. Players who qualify for the year-end ATP Finals also include any points gained from the tournament in their total, increasing the number of tournaments counted to 19.\nATP singles ranking.\n1973–1982; \"ATP ranking's average system as introduced on 23 August 1973\".\n1983–1989; \"ATP ranking's average system with bonus points for beating top ranked players\".\n1990–1999; \" ‘Best of 14’ ranking system, where a player’s best 14 results in the events counted\".\n2000–2008; \" ‘Best of 18’ ranking system, where a player’s best 18 results in the events counted\".\n2009–2019; \" A new point scale for ATP rankings to the ‘Best of 18’ ranking system\".\n2020–2021; \" ‘Best of 24-month’ ranking system from Aug 23, 2020 to Aug 9, 2021 for the pandemic-impacted seasons\".\n2022–present; \"Normal ATP’s ranking system over a 52-week period restored since August 2021\".\nATP records and distinctions.\nNovak Djokovic has spent the most weeks as world No. 1, a record total weeks. Roger Federer has a record 237 consecutive weeks at No. 1. Djokovic also holds the record for the most year-end No. 1 finishes, achieving the feat for eight years (including the pandemic-shortened season). Pete Sampras held the year-end No. 1 ranking for a record six consecutive years.\nCarlos Alcaraz is both the youngest world No. 1 (19 years, 4 months), and the youngest year-end No. 1 (19 years, 7 months). Djokovic is both the oldest world No. 1 () and the oldest year-end No. 1 ().\nFederer is the player with the longest time span (14 years) between his first and most recent dates at No. 1 (February 2004–June 2018), while Rafael Nadal is the only player to hold the top ranking in three different decades, spanning 11 years and 5 months (2008–2020). Djokovic has the longest time span (12 years) between his first and last year-end No. 1 finish (2011–2023), and is the only player to be ranked No. 1 at least once in a year for 13 different years. \nTwo players, Ivan Lendl and Marcelo Ríos, have reached No. 1 without previously having won a major singles title. Lendl reached No. 1 on February 21, 1983, but did not win his first Grand Slam title until the 1984 French Open. Ríos reached No. 1 on March 30, 1998, but retired without ever having won a Grand Slam title, making him the only No. 1 player with that distinction.\nFederer holds the record of wire-to-wire No. 1 for three consecutive calendar years. Since 1973 when the ATP rankings started, there have been 13 years in which one player held the top spot for the entire year: Jimmy Connors in 1975, 1976, and 1978; Lendl in 1986 and 1987; Pete Sampras in 1994 and 1997; Hewitt in 2002; Federer in 2005, 2006, and 2007; and Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. In contrast, 1999 saw five players hold the No. 1 ranking (the most in any single year): Sampras, Carlos Moyá, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Andre Agassi, and Patrick Rafter.\nPrior to 2009, Federer accumulated the most year-end ATP ranking points in any season, with 8,370 points in 2006. Since the introduction of a new point scale for the ATP rankings from 2009, Djokovic achieved the same feat with 16,585 ranking points in 2015 season. Djokovic also holds the record of 16,950 ranking points on 6 June 2016, the most ATP points ever accumulated by any player.\nJohn McEnroe held the No. 1 ranking a record 14 times, Sampras and Djokovic are the only two other players to have held it 10 or more times, with 11 and 10 stints respectively. Rafter spent the least time at number 1 (one week).\nYear-end No. 1 players.\nThe ATP year-end No. 1 (ATP Player of the Year), in recent decades, has been determined as the player who ends the year as world No. 1 in the ATP rankings. Prior to the early 1990s this was not always the case, in some instances the \"ATP Player of the Year\" and the Year-end No. 1 in the rankings were different players (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1989). Novak Djokovic holds the ATP record of eight year-end No. 1 finishes. Overall, 18 players have achieved the year-end No. 1 ranking, only four of them (Lendl, Federer, Djokovic, Nadal) have done so in non-consecutive years. Six players have stayed at No. 1 in the ATP rankings for every week of the calendar year. Connors and Federer have done so in three years, Connors non-consecutively and Federer consecutively.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005",
        "text": "The Bangladeshi cricket team toured Sri Lanka for three One Day International cricket matches and two Test cricket matches in August and September 2005. The Bangladeshi team was coming off a moderately successful tour of England, as they had pushed Australia close in one ODI and beat them in another. However, they had still lost five out of six matches in the NatWest Series, both of the Test matches, and remained at the bottom of both the ICC Test Championship and ICC ODI Championship. The hosts Sri Lanka, meanwhile, were undefeated in home ODI tournaments since February 2004, and in home Test series since March 2004, both against top-ranked Australia. Their win in the Indian Oil Cup a month before this series saw them into second place in the ODI Championship, but they are only ranked sixth in Tests.\nMatches played.\nSri Lanka Cricket XI v Bangladesh, 28 August.\nSri Lanka Cricket XI won by ten wickets\nA slow start by openers Rajin Saleh and Javed Omar cost Bangladesh dearly in the warm-up match against a side of Sri Lankan fringe players at Moratuwa, along with an inability to take wickets. The pair added 59 for the first wicket, but never really got off the mark, and when Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran dismissed Omar and Aftab Ahmed in quick succession things started to look tricky. The other players were forced to make runs quickly, and two run outs followed as a result. In the end, it was the experienced all-rounders Mohammad Rafique and Khaled Mashud who ensured that Bangladesh set a somewhat competitive target of 236. However, Avishka Gunawardene and Upul Tharanga both made centuries, and the Bangladeshi bowlers were thoroughly hit around. Sri Lanka made their way to 236 for 0 in just 36.1 overs of the possible 50. To add insult to injury, Mashrafe Mortaza suffered a back spasm and was ruled out of the first ODI.\nCricinfo scorecard\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nBangladesh won the toss in the first of three matches, and under cloudy skies they chose to bowl first, putting faith in his newly composed seam bowling attack of Tapash Baisya and Syed Rasel with the new ball. However, the pair leaked runs during the first eight overs, and the score was 51 for 0 when Baisya ran in to bowl his fifth over of the day and Bangladesh's ninth. However, Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled by an inswinging delivery from Baisya for 25, and that slowed Sri Lanka down. Baisya even bowled a maiden over as the Sri Lankans chose to wait out the middle overs and set the platform for big hitting at the end - which worked perfectly.\nAftab Ahmed, the batsman used as an all-rounder with his medium pace in ODIs, got a bit of movement in the conditions, and that helped him to take two wickets - those of Tharanga and Kumar Sangakkara. However, he also bowled five wides in the process, and one of them even went to the boundary for four runs. Ahmed conceded 55 runs off his ten overs, and the two wickets did not help Bangladesh much, as Mahela Jayawardene and Russel Arnold helped themselves to boundaries as the innings neared a close. Spinner Mohammad Rafique toiled for Bangladesh, but could only get one wicket for plenty of runs, although a stumping chance went begging earlier on. Arnold was run out at the end of the 43rd over, though, and Manjural Islam Rana got a wicket with his last delivery of the day, as the new batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan swept a top edge to Syed Rasel down the leg side. The wickets slowed Sri Lanka down somewhat, but only temporarily, as Jayawardene quickly got on top of the bowling again. In the final over of Sri Lanka's innings, three wickets fell, Jayawardene eventually being run out having added 50 runs in an hour. Sri Lanka closed on 269 for 9.\nA crowd of a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three boundaries in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time it was all too late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted to block out the overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.\nCricinfo scorecard\n2nd ODI.\nUpul Tharanga made another big score as Sri Lanka once again batted Bangladesh out of the game. The left-hander, who had a disappointing run in the Indian Oil Cup a month earlier, now hit plenty of boundaries into the off side, as he and Sanath Jayasuriya flayed the Bangladeshi pacers Tapash Baisya, Syed Rasel and Nazmul Hossain. Admittedly, Tharanga had a slice of luck early on, as Manjural Islam Rana dropped him at slip on 13, but he never failed from there. In the opening 15 overs, Tharanga and Jayasuriya added 100 runs, before Jayasuriya finally edged a short-pitched ball behind to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud. A slower period followed, as number 3 Dilshan was more cautious against the seam bowlers, spending an hour at the crease but only making 27. Tharanga, however, accumulated singles well off the spinners, keeping the run rate well above five an over to end with 105 before Rana got his revenge - Tharanga came down the pitch to Rana, but missed the ball, and was stumped by Masud.\nThe Bangladeshi bowlers bowled patiently, but the poor start had cost them badly, and it went from bad to worse when Nazmul limped off in his seventh over. He was eventually substituted for Tushar Imran, while Aftab Ahmed took over his bowling duties. Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go. Sangakkara eventually fell to Rafique, and in the next over Syed Rasel got rid of pinch hitter Dilhara Lokuhettige for 2, only to see Mahela Jayawardene, the man of the last match, come in to partner Atapattu. The pair added 43 from the last 26 balls, Atapattu recording a whirlwind 53 while Jayawardene closed on 23.\nThe chase was never really on for Bangladesh, who kept their run rate steadily above 4 an over but had to see the required rate explode to nearly nine an over. When that happened in the 28th over, and the score was at 121 for 2, the Bangladeshis tried to hit out, and duly lost three wickets to Dilshan's off spin. Shahriar Nafees was first to fall to Dilshan's spin, having made his second ODI fifty in six games, while Rafique and Ashraful followed shortly afterwards. Forced onto the back foot with the score 140 for 5, Bangladesh put on substitute Tushar Imran, who joined in a partnership of 71 with Bashar in 13 overs. However, the pair scored too slowly to have any chance of winning, instead just trying to save face. Sri Lanka saved their pace bowlers again, opting for Dilshan, Upul Chandana and even the medium pace of Mahela Jayawardene, as they used eight of their eleven possible bowlers in the innings.\nCricinfo scorecard\n3rd ODI.\nBangladesh failed to convert a promising start into a competitive total in the third and final ODI of the series, as Maharoof and Lokuhettige conceded 46 runs off the eight opening overs, despite bowling in friendly conditions with plenty of clouds. Lokuhettige was especially expensive, and was duly taken off for Dilhara Fernando, who got the breakthrough for Sri Lanka as Javed Omar was out lbw to Fernando. That started the slide. Maharoof continued from the other end, inducing catches from the bats of Rafique and Shahriar Nafees, and suddenly Bangladesh were staring down a familiar hole, the score 51 for 3 at the end of 10 overs.\nComposure would be required from Aftab Ahmed and Mohammad Ashraful, but the pair lasted only one over, Fernando bowling a slower ball to Ashraful which he could not get bat on and was lbw for 0. Aftab Ahmed saw off six more balls before he, too, was lbw, misreading the line of a ball from Maharoof, and captain Bashar completed the procession by edging to Sangakkara for 1. In 26 deliveries, Bangladesh had only scored seven runs, and they had lost six wickets in the process. The primary task for Bangladesh now were to survive 48 overs (their innings had been shortened slightly due to bad light), but even that was too much of a challenge, as the spinners Upul Chandana and Tillakaratne Dilshan shared the four last wickets, all caught, to see Bangladesh all out for 108.\nThe chase of 106 - again cut down due to rain - was led by Avishka Gunawardene, who saw off the opening bowlers with relative ease, taking Rasel for runs while defending more against the experienced Baisya - who dug out two wickets, those of Tharanga and pinch-hitter Lokuhettige. However, he did not get any further wickets, and Bangladesh were put to the sword by Gunawardene before Rafique and Mahmud calmed him down as he neared fifty. After four overs without boundaries, Gunawardene brought up his fifty with one edged through third man, before pulling a short ball straight to Tushar Imran who held the catch comfortably. Yet, Sri Lanka still needed 22 runs for the victory, with seven wickets in hand and one of their most experienced batsmen in Kumar Sangakkara at the crease. In the 21st over, Sangakkara levelled the scores with two big leg side shots that went for four, before calling a risky single that had Thilan Samaraweera run out for 18. Nevertheless, it was all too late, as Sangakkara wrapped it up by hitting a single to midwicket.\nCricinfo scorecard\nSri Lanka Development XI v Bangladeshis, 7–9 September.\nMatch drawn\nSri Lanka's Development XI, strengthened by internationals Thilan Samaraweera and Gayan Wijekoon who was picked to get match practice before the Tests, dominated the three-day, 12-a-side game with Bangladesh, but could not force a victory. Winning the toss and bowling first, the Development XI got off to a good start, with Tharanga Lakshitha taking two wickets. Bangladesh crashed to 90 for 6, but Javed Omar fought back with an uncharacteristically quick 81, and he was also helped by Tapash Baisya who made 54. Nevertheless, Gayan Wijekoon and 19-year-old leg spinner Gihan Rupasinghe took three wickets each, as Bangladesh were all out for 197. Bangladesh then put in a lacklustre bowling effort, conceding 48 extras - 25 in no-balls - while Shantha Kalavitigoda, wicket-keeper Gihan de Silva and left-hander Jeewan Mendis made fifties. Four wickets from Syed Rasel helped little, as the Development XI made their way to 412. Bangladesh survived out the last day for a draw, however, despite crashing to 92 for 4, thanks to fifties from Mohammad Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed. \nTest series.\n1st Test.\nBangladesh were given their eighth innings defeat in ten Test matches by Sri Lanka, losing after seven sessions of play in Colombo, despite a promising start. They lost Shahriar Nafees early, as he was bowled between bat and pad by Lasith Malinga, but Javed Omar made a gutsy 30, and Habibul Bashar got his second successive Test half-century, as Bangladesh made their way to 155 for 2.\nThen, Bangladesh lost their heads. Ashraful attempted a big heave off Herath, but was caught by Dilhara Fernando in the deep. Two overs later, Tushar Imran was bowled by Herath, but the killing blow came with the next delivery. A throw from close in ran out Habibul Bashar - he had managed to get his bat over the line, but it bounced up and did not touch the ground when the ball hit the stumps. Bangladesh had lost three wickets for one run, and more was to come, as Muttiah Muralitharan and Herath took one wicket each within the space of six deliveries. At 158 for 7, Bangladesh batted for face, and debutant Syed Rasel tried with a streaky 19. He was last out, stumped off Herath, who ended with four for 38. In return, Sri Lanka played a bit more sedately, and none of their batsmen passed fifty in the 44 overs in their innings on day one, yet they only trailed 28 runs with seven wickets in hand.\nSri Lanka continued on their merry path in the second innings, as Mohammad Rafique and Enamul Haque toiled for the better part of the morning and afternoon sessions to little reward. A slow pitch rewarded gritty batting, as shown by Thilan Samaraweera's four-hour 78. Fifties also came from Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan - the latter was last out, missing an attempted pull shot as the ball from Rasel clattered into his stumps, bowled for 86. Rafique had cleaned up the lower order earlier, removing Chaminda Vaas, Herath and Muralitharan en route to his sixth five-wicket-haul of his career, but Dilhara Fernando had lasted for 30 minutes with Dilshan when Rasel broke through. With the score 370 for 9, Sri Lanka didn't bother to send the rabbit Lasith Malinga in to bat, and Marvan Atapattu declared.\nBangladesh were sent in to bat, and Lasith Malinga took one wicket in three expensive opening overs, but Shahriar Nafees and Habibul Bashar took the fight to the Sri Lankan seam bowlers. With the score 35 for 1 after 7 overs, Atapattu brought on off spinner Muralitharan - who had quietly taken three for 42 in the first innings - and he immediately delivered. His third ball to Shahriar was left alone, and clattered into the opener's stumps - out for 13. Mohammad Ashraful only lasted one ball, trapped lbw by the doosra. Rain then provided relief for the Bangladeshis, as the second day's play was ended prematurely, but they looked to struggle to another innings defeat.\nIndeed, the third day became a nightmare. On a typical Sri Lankan turning track, Muralitharan finished with the fine figures of six for 18, as the Bangladeshis were bamboozled. Habibul Bashar started the procession with the ninth delivery of the day, which he edged to wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara, and from then on, only Khaled Mashud lasted for more than half an hour. He was also the only one to get into double figures, as Bangladesh were all out for 86, their lowest Test score of their five-year Test history to date.\nCricinfo scorecard\n2nd Test.\nBangladesh competed for half a session in the second Test, before crashing to a familiar innings defeat - their 24th in 40 Tests. In that first half-session, however, they showed a great deal of seam bowling competence. Their new ball bowlers Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain took two wickets each as Sri Lanka's top order struggled. It was Sri Lanka who had chosen to bat, but the Bangladeshis got some movement with the ball early on, and after Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya had added 28 for the first wicket, Shahadat struck in the sixth over.\nFirst, he bowled a ball that Atapattu found prudent to leave alone, and nearly knocked down the off-stump of the Sri Lankan captain. Two balls later, a ball moving away from the batsman found the outside edge, and Atapattu was gone for 11. Jayasuriya was nearly run out in the next over, before perishing lbw, and Rasel and Shahadat then got two balls to nip back in and crash into the batsmen's stumps. In the space of 13 overs, Bangladesh had taken four wickets for 48 runs - only the second time in their five-year history that the first four wickets of their opponents had fallen for less than 50.\nThilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan battled well, however, adding 69 before lunch, although Dilshan benefitted from a dropped catch by Mohammad Ashraful. Ashraful and Bangladesh were to pay the highest price for this let-off. After lunch, the seamers were nowhere near as effective, and Dilshan plundered runs with ease. Bangladesh's spinners, Mohammad Rafique and Enamul Haque jnr were ineffective as Dilshan and Samaraweera passed milestones with ease. The 100 partnership came up shortly after lunch, and then fifty for each individual, and Dilshan reached 133 not out by the end of the session, the partnership having added 220 for the fifth wicket - needing 14 in the evening session to overcome the previous Sri Lankan Test record for the fifth wicket, set against Bangladesh at the very same ground three years earlier.\nThey passed that record shortly after tea, and went on to add 280, before Dilshan nicked behind to Khaled Mashud and a stroke-filled three-and-a-half-hour innings came to an end. He recorded his highest Test score of his career to date, with 168. Samaraweera was out four short of his highest Test score, making 138, as Bangladesh got two wickets with the new ball - yet Sri Lanka had turned 48 for 4 to 449 for 7 in the space of two and a half sessions. Chaminda Vaas added insult to injury, smacking ten fours and a six to bring up 61 before the close of play, and he would begin the second day 13 short of his highest Test score.\nRasel ended that dream for Vaas, though, as the Sri Lankan dragged the ball into his stumps to be bowled for 65. Sri Lanka, once again, declared without giving Lasith Malinga the chance to bat, leaving Bangladesh 457 to hit for first-innings parity. It started well, as Javed Omar and Shahriar Nafees added 16 in 5 overs, but Shahriar edged a delivery from Malinga into the diving keeper's hands, and Habibul Bashar came in for a short visit at the crease. He managed 18, before he was caught off Dilhara Fernando, and Fernando went on to take three wickets as Bangladesh crawled to 80 for 4 at lunch. Only Mohammad Ashraful had passed 20 of the top five, but he did survive a close lbw shout on 14 due to Fernando bowling a no-ball.\nAshraful went on after lunch, making 42 before a slower ball from Fernando ended his 43-run stand with Aftab Ahmed, and after that, wickets fell quickly. Muttiah Muralitharan added three to his series tally, which now stood at 12, and eight people were caught in the Bangladeshi innings, which lasted 45.4 overs. It would have been even less but for a determined half-hour between Mashud and Enamul - the pair added 25 in 9 overs before Mashud was stumped shortly after tea. Bangladesh were asked to follow on, and once again gave up catches - Nafees Iqbal had been promoted to opener, and made 30 quickly, before giving up a leg side catch to Sangakkara. Earlier, Javed Omar and Habibul Bashar had been out to expansive shots for low scores, and once again it was down to Ashraful. He recorded 21 runs in the evening session, at an unusually slow pace, while Shahriar Nafees were left to hit the big shots, taking eight fours off the Sri Lankan bowlers as he moved to 51. Two balls before the close of play, however, he edged to Samaraweera at slip, giving Muralitharan another wicket, and Bangladesh closed on 131 for 4, still 135 short of Sri Lanka's first innings score.\nBangladesh's resistance lasted for 26.4 overs on the third morning, very similar to their effort in the first Test. Vaas broke through first, removing Ashraful and nightwatchman Shahadat in successive overs, as Bangladesh's last recognised batting partnership was in with the score 139 for 6. Aftab Ahmed and Khaled Mashud held out for 11 overs, but Rangana Herath took the wicket of Aftab and the last two batsmen, leaving Bangladesh all out for 197 - an improvement by 27 runs in the loss margin, but still a comprehensive defeat."

        "text": "The Sinhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground (SSC Cricket Ground) (; ) is one of the most famous cricket grounds in Sri Lanka, and the headquarters of Sri Lanka Cricket, the controlling body of cricket in Sri Lanka. The ground is sometimes described as \"the Lord's of Sri Lanka\", It hosts the most domestic finals and is an important international cricket venue. The ground staged its first Test in 1984 against New Zealand and its first One Day International in 1982 against England. The Sri Lankan team has an impressive record here. Out of 38 Tests played at the SSC , Sri Lanka has won 18 matches, and drawn 14, with only 6 losses.\nHistory.\nIn 1899, a combined school cricket team, composed mainly of cricketers from Royal College, S. Thomas' College and Wesley College beat Colts Cricket Club by a one run. A decision was made to form an all-Sinhalese club, and thus Singhalese Sports Club was founded. The club leased land in Victoria Park with sandy soil and covered with cinnamon trees.\nIn 1952 the club leased another and moved to its present location in Maitland Place, which had been used as an aerodrome by the allied forces in World War II.\nGround.\nThe pavilion of the ground was built in 1956 with the sponsorship of Donovan Andree, a leading nightclub entrepreneur. A giant scoreboard and sightscreens were built in the mid-70s. Later the current scoreboard was built. The ground also has a media center and commentary box with modern facilities. Various sponsors including Lankabell, Seylan Bank and HSBC have built stands bearing their brands. There are two grass embankments for the spectators.\nHighlights.\nIn 1992 Australian tour of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka lost the SSC Test match to Australia by 16 runs after being set a target of only 181 runs. This is one of Sri Lanka's narrowest defeats in Test cricket. Shane Warne took three wickets in thirteen balls; this was his first notable performance in Test cricket.\nIn the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship, Mohammed Ashraful of Bangladesh become the youngest cricketer to score a Test hundred, one day before his 17th birthday. However Bangladesh went on to lose the match by an innings and 137 runs.\nChaminda Vaas took 8 wickets for 19 runs in 2001–02 against Zimbabwe, the best bowling performance in a One Day International match. The Zimbabwean total of 38 was the lowest team innings total in ODIs at that point of time.\nKumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene shared a partnership of 624 runs against South Africa in 2006–07 season, the highest partnership for any wicket in Test and first class cricket.\nGround Figures.\nKey.\nUpdated 5 February 2024\nICC Champions Trophy matches.\nThe 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was held in Sri Lanka.

        "text": "The Adelaide Equestrian Festival (AEF) is an annual three-day event held in the eastern Adelaide Park Lands, which border Adelaide city centre. It was known as the Australian International Three Day Event until 2022. A CCI5* event, the top rating by the Fédération Équestre Internationale, it comprises dressage, cross-country, and show-jumping and is usually staged in late April. \nHistory.\nThe Adelaide International Horse Trials was created in 1997 to replace the Gawler Horse Trials that had been staged in Gawler, north of Adelaide, since 1954. In its period as the Gawler Trials, it was a successful competition and was selected to host the Eventing World Championship in 1986. On this occasion the Australian Post Office issued a special set of commemorative postmarked covers featuring a set of four stamps called Horses of Australia.\nThe new 1997 event in the East Parklands began with a CCI3* (3-star) rating, but was subsequently upgraded to CCI4* in 2002, becoming the only such event in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn 2004, it was known as the Mitsubishi Adelaide International Horse Trials, being sponsored by Mitsubishi.\nIn 2007, to celebrate its 10th anniversary and better reflect its international focus, the event was renamed the Australian International Three Day Event, and was held at the end of November each year. From 2011 the Australian International became part of the FEI (Fédération Équestre Internationale) Classics series of events, for three years sponsored by HSBC.\nIn 2019, the event was upgraded to CCI5* status.\nIn 2022 the event was renamed the Adelaide Equestrian Festival and held in April each year. \nGovernance.\nThe AEF is owned and run by Adelaide Horse Trials Management Inc., and is supported by the South Australian Government through the South Australian Tourism Commission.\nEvent.\nThe event is held throughout the East Parklands in separate stages over three days. It is classified as a CCI5* by the international governing body FEI, meaning that it is highest level of eventing competition under the FEI banner. it is one of seven in the world, with the other taking place in the UK, France, Germany, and the US.\nThe event is unique in being held in a city-centre, taking place in the Adelaide Park Lands.\nThe dressage phase is held on Friday on the arena in front of the heritage-listed Victoria Park Grandstand. The cross-country phase is held on Saturday across the park lands and attracts the most spectators. The course starts in the arena in front of the grandstand, crosses Wakefield Road to Ityamai-itpina / King Rodney Park (Park 15) and then crosses Bartels Road into Rymill Park / Murlawirrapurka (Park 14) and then returns to the arena again. The cross-country course has been designed by Michael Etherington-Smith, who has designed courses for the Olympics in 2000 and 2008 and other CCI5* events, and more recently, by Australian Wayne Copping. The water jumps in Rymill Park are regarded as some of the most challenging in international competition. The final show-jumping phase is held on Sunday in the main arena in Victoria Park / Pakapakanthi (Park 16).\n, the event is used to select the Australian team for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. \nSee also.\nOther five-star events include:"

        "title": "Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" was a walk-off home run hit by New York Giants outfielder and third baseman Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca at the Polo Grounds in New York City on October 3, 1951, to win the National League (NL) pennant. Thomson's dramatic three-run homer came in the ninth inning of the decisive third game of a three-game playoff for the pennant in which the Giants trailed 4–1 entering the ninth and 4–2 with two runners on base at the time of Thomson's at-bat.\nThe game was seen by millions of viewers across America and heard on radio by millions more, including thousands of American servicemen stationed in Korea, listening on Armed Forces Radio. The dramatic victory to secure a pennant was intensified by the cross-town rivalry between the Giants and Dodgers and by a remarkable string of victories in the last weeks of the regular season by the Giants, who won 37 of their last 44 games to catch the first-place Dodgers and force a playoff series to decide the NL champion. The Giants' late-season rally and 2-to-1-game playoff victory, capped by Thomson's moment of triumph, are collectively known in baseball lore as \"The Miracle of Coogan's Bluff\", a descriptor coined by the legendary sports columnist Red Smith.\nThe phrase \"shot heard round the world\" is from the 1837 poem \"Concord Hymn\" by Ralph Waldo Emerson, about the first clash of the American Revolutionary War, and has been popularly applied to several dramatic historical moments.\nBackground.\nThe principal National League (NL) contenders in 1951 were the New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers quickly pulled into first place, and widened their lead as the season progressed. On August 11, with a -game lead over the second-place Giants, they appeared certain to face the New York Yankees in the World Series. \"Unless [the Dodgers] completely fold in their last 50 games\", wrote an Associated Press writer, \"they're in.\" The Phillies, games back, faded from contention; but the Giants won 16 straight games from August 12 to August 27, cutting the Dodgers' lead to six games. By September 20, they had pulled to within games, still a prohibitive margin with only ten days remaining in the season; but the Giants won all of their final seven games, while the Dodgers lost six of their last ten. The two teams concluded the regular season deadlocked with records.\nThe NL used a three-game playoff at that time to break ties for the pennant. The Dodgers won the coin toss to determine the playoff schedule; they elected to play the first game at home and the second (and third if needed) at the Polo Grounds, reasoning that after a likely win in Brooklyn, they would need to win only one of two at the Giants' park. Nevertheless, in game one at Ebbets Field, the Giants, with Jim Hearn on the mound, defeated the Dodgers' Ralph Branca 3–1, thanks to home runs by Bobby Thomson and Monte Irvin. In game two at the Polo Grounds, with the Yankees team in attendance as spectators (another version has the Yankees at Game Three but leaving before the fateful home run to beat the traffic), the Dodgers tied the series, winning 10–0 on home runs by Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges, Andy Pafko, and Rube Walker, who was catching in place of an injured Roy Campanella. Clem Labine pitched a six-hit shutout against Sheldon Jones. The 1–1 deadlock set up the deciding third game at the Polo Grounds on October 3.\nThe game.\nFor game three, Sal Maglie was on the mound for New York, while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe. In the first inning, Robinson singled in Pee Wee Reese for the game's first run. A Giants rally in the second inning, initiated by Whitey Lockman's single, fizzled when Thomson, trying to stretch a single into a double, failed to notice that Lockman had not advanced to third base, and was tagged out by Robinson. The score remained 1–0 through the sixth inning. In the seventh inning, Irvin led off with a double for the Giants. He was bunted over to third, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.\nIn the top of the eighth, the Dodgers came back with three runs. With Reese and Duke Snider on third and first after back-to-back singles, a Maglie wild pitch allowed Reese to score and Snider to advance to second. Robinson was walked intentionally to set up a double play, but Pafko's ground ball to third bounced off the heel of Thomson's glove; Snider scored and Robinson took third. Billy Cox added another single to score Robinson, making the score 4–1 in favor of the Dodgers. Newcombe set down the Giants in order in the bottom of the eighth, while Larry Jansen did the same in relief of Maglie in the top of the ninth.\nNewcombe had pitched a complete game on September 29, four days earlier, in Philadelphia, followed by innings in relief the following day during the last game of the regular season. According to some accounts, after eight innings on only two days' rest he attempted to take himself out of the game, but Robinson demanded that he continue: \"You go out there and pitch until your arm falls off!\" Newcombe himself insisted that he never asked to be relieved—a version corroborated by Snider and Pafko.\nGiants shortstop Alvin Dark singled off Newcombe to start the bottom-ninth rally. At that point, the Dodgers made a crucial defensive mistake: With no outs, a runner on first, and a three-run lead, the normal strategy would be to position the infield for a possible double play; but first baseman Gil Hodges played behind Dark — apparently guarding against a highly unlikely steal attempt — leaving a large gap on the right side of the infield. Don Mueller, batting left-handed, hit a single through that gap, advancing Dark from first to third. Instead of a rally-killing double play, the Dodgers found themselves facing the potential tying run at the plate with two runners on base, nobody out, and Irvin, with 121 regular-season RBIs, at bat; but Newcombe got Irvin to chase an outside pitch and foul out to Hodges. (Sportswriter Bud Greenspan and others have argued that, had the Dodger infield played Mueller at double-play depth, Irvin's pop-up would in all likelihood have been the season-ending third out.)\nLockman followed with a double down the left field line, driving in Dark and advancing Mueller to third. Mueller slid awkwardly into the base, injuring his ankle, and was replaced by pinch runner Clint Hartung. With Thomson coming up, Dodgers manager Chuck Dressen finally pulled the exhausted Newcombe. In the bullpen, where Branca and Carl Erskine were warming up, coach Clyde Sukeforth noticed that Erskine — who had been troubled by arm problems all season — was bouncing his curve balls short of the plate, and advised Dressen to use Branca in relief. That decision has been continually second-guessed by fans, sportswriters, and baseball historians: Branca had lost six of his last seven decisions, and gave up a game-winning home run to Thomson in the first playoff game. Dressen's options, however, were severely limited: the only other available pitchers with crucial-situation experience were Clyde King, who was sidelined with biceps tendonitis; Preacher Roe, who was left-handed; and Labine, who had pitched a complete game the day before. Nevertheless, it was the second questionable decision by Dressen that inning.\nThomson was now at bat, with first base open and Willie Mays (soon to be named the NL Rookie of the Year) on deck. Mays had gone 0-for-3 with two strikeouts against Branca in the first playoff game; but Dressen was unwilling to put the winning run on base, and worried that a veteran pinch hitter might be brought in to bat for Mays if he did so. In a third controversial decision, Dressen elected to pitch to Thomson rather than walk him intentionally. Thomson later recalled that as he left the on-deck circle, Giants manager Leo Durocher turned to him and said, \"If you ever hit one, hit it now.\"\nBranca's first pitch was a called strike on the inside corner. His second was a fastball high and inside, intended as a setup for his next, a breaking ball down and away; but Thomson connected strongly, driving the ball down the left field line. The ball landed in the lower-deck stands near the left field foul line for a game-ending, three-run home run. Thomson ran the bases, then disappeared into a mob of jubilant teammates gathered at home plate. The stunned Dodger players began the long walk toward the visitors' clubhouse under the center field bleachers; Robinson turned to watch Thomson, making certain that he touched every base, before following his teammates off the field.\nLater, after the celebrations had calmed down, a delegation of Dodgers—Reese, Snider, Roe, and Robinson—visited the Giants' locker room to offer their congratulations. \"I just want you to know that we didn't lose the pennant,\" Robinson told them. \"You guys won it.\"\nThomson's role in the game.\nBefore hitting the game-winning home run, Thomson was involved in several crucial plays throughout the game in all three facets of hitting, fielding, and base running.\nAt the plate, he went 3-for-3 and batted in four of the Giants' five runs. He erased both Dodger leads in the game, tying it at 1–1 with a sacrifice fly in the seventh, and, of course, winning it with his home run in the ninth.\nThomson was also involved in several plays that hurt the Giants. His base running error in the second inning ended a potential rally for the Giants, who were trailing 1–0 at the time. Gordon McLendon, who was broadcasting the game on the Liberty radio network, drew comparisons between Thomson's mistake and Merkle's Boner, which cost the Giants the pennant in 1908, and Red Smith structured his game report around that play.\nAfter Thomson tied the game with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Dodgers scored three runs in the top of the eighth to go ahead 4–1. Two of the Dodger runs scored on balls hit towards Thomson, one deflecting off his glove into foul territory, and the other passing him into left field. Red Smith commented on the latter hit by asking—and answering—the rhetorical question, \"Where does [Billy Cox's] hit go? Where else? Through Thomson at third.\"\nAfter both teams went down in order in the next inning, it was under these circumstances that Thomson stepped to the plate in the ninth inning with one out, two runners on, and the Giants trailing by two runs.\nThe broadcasts.\nSeveral television and radio broadcasters captured the moment for baseball fans in the New York City area and nationwide.\nRuss Hodges.\nThe best known live description—\"arguably the most famous call in sports\"—was delivered by Russ Hodges, who was broadcasting the game on WMCA-AM radio for Giants fans. His call captured the suddenness and exultation of the home run:\nBroadcasts were not routinely taped in 1951, and no one at any of the local radio or television stations was recording the game. The WMCA call survives only because a Brooklyn-based fan named Lawrence Goldberg asked his mother to tape-record the last half-inning of the radio broadcast while he was at work. In later years, Hodges told interviewers that Goldberg was a Dodgers fan who made the tape \"so he could hear the voice of the Giants weep when Brooklyn won\". In fact, Goldberg had been a Giants fan since childhood.\nIn 2020, the Library of Congress inducted Hodges' broadcast into the National Recording Registry for \"cultural, historical and aesthetic importance to the nation’s recorded sound heritage.\"\nErnie Harwell.\nHodges' broadcasting partner, Ernie Harwell, called the game for the team's television flagship WPIX; the independent station's broadcast was also carried nationally on the NBC network, the first coast-to-coast live telecast of a Major League Baseball game. Harwell's description was not recorded; he later recalled saying simply, \"It's gone!\" almost at the moment Thomson's bat struck the ball—and then watching in dismay as the ball began to sink. \"I said to myself, 'If that ball drops into Pafko's glove, I'm in deep trouble.' \" As the ball disappeared into the lower deck, he recalled, no further commentary was necessary. \"The pictures took over.\"\nRed Barber.\nDodgers announcer Red Barber, calling the game for WMGM-AM radio, straightforwardly said, \"Branca pumps, delivers – a curve, swung on and belted, deep shot to left field—it is—a home run! And the New York Giants win the National League pennant and the Polo Grounds goes wild!\" Barber was openly critical of Hodges' call, labeling it \"unprofessional\".\nGordon McLendon.\nOnly local Giants fans heard the famous Hodges call live. Most listeners heard McLendon's call on the Liberty Broadcasting System, which carried the game nationally. McLendon's account (complete with a similarly enthusiastic yell of \"The Giants win the pennant!\")—preserved on Harwell's \"Audio Scrapbook\"—remains the only professionally recorded broadcast account of the entire third game.\nOther.\nThe game was also broadcast on radio by Al Helfer for the Mutual Broadcasting System, by Buck Canel and Felo Ramírez for a Spanish language network, and by Nat Allbright in a studio re-creation for the Dodgers' secondary network in the South. Harry Caray, then an announcer with the St. Louis Cardinals, called the game for a St. Louis radio station. Pittsburgh Pirates announcer Bob Prince was in the WMCA booth with Hodges and may have also participated in broadcasting the game.\nAftermath.\n\"New York Herald Tribune\" sportswriter Red Smith titled his October 4 column \"The Miracle of Coogan's Bluff\", and began it with what has been called \"the greatest lede ever written\":\nAnother sportswriter, \"The Washington Post\"'s Shirley Povich, wrote that \"Hollywood's most imaginative screenwriters on an opium jag could not have imagined a more improbable windup of the season that had started in April and had its finish today in the triumph of Bobby Thomson and the Giants.\"\nThe Giants lost the ensuing World Series to the Yankees in six games.\nSukeforth resigned his position as bullpen coach in January 1952, after 19 years with the Dodgers. He denied that his role in the final inning of the Shot game had any bearing on his decision to leave. Some historians have since speculated otherwise, based on Dressen's post-game reply to why he brought in Branca: \"Sukeforth said he was ready.\" Sukeforth told a journalist in 2000—the last year of his life—that \"everybody knows the manager is responsible for decisions.\" He added, \"It didn't matter what anybody said ... Branca was the only one who could come in when that big guy [Newcombe] couldn't go any further.\"\nIndividual recollections of Thomson's home run continued to emerge decades after the event. In the 1990s, Thomson received a letter from a Marine who had been stationed in Korea in 1951:\nIn the fall of 2001, surviving members of the 1951 Giants and Dodgers, including Thomson and Branca, met at Coogan's Bluff, overlooking the site of the long since demolished ballpark, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the game.\nThomson's baseball legacy rests almost completely on the Shot, despite his other notable accomplishments, such as eight 20-home run seasons and three All Star selections. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me\", he told a reporter toward the end of his life. \"It may have been the best thing that ever happened to anybody.\"\nOrigin of the phrase.\nAccording to baseball historian Jules Tygiel, \"[t]he phrase ['shot heard 'round the world'] was in the air\", having been used literally or in a slightly deviated form in connection with the 1935 Masters and a Jackie Robinson home run just three days prior to Thomson's home run to force the playoff series. The day after the game, October 4, 1951, the \"New York Daily News\" ran a front-page game recap under the headline, \"The Shot Heard 'Round the Baseball World\". and a \"New York Times\" editorial that same day called Thomson's homer \"the home run heard round the world.\" According to Tygiel, the \"two phrases merged in the popular memory\" and quickly spread to other media, and \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" soon became the most popular epithet for Thomson's homer. It is a direct reference to a line in Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem \"Concord Hymn\" to describe the opening shot of the Battle of Concord.\nIn addition to a historical and literary reference, the phrase can also be seen as a sign of the times. Tygiel reads it as a reflection of \"American postwar arrogance\", and sportswriter Eric Neel considers it as an example of many sportswriters of the time displaying a \"Cold War feel for the apocalyptic\" in their writing—dramatizing sports through war and battle metaphors. As a matter of fact, the very same day that Thomson hit his home run, the Soviet Union set off an atomic bomb test, which created the juxtaposition of the \"'unrepeatable, communal joy' of […] Thomson's gallop around the bases and the collective fear inspired by an escalating atomic race\" in the next day's newspapers.\nThat being said, the nickname may have simply emerged and stuck as a result of extended media coverage. This three-game series was \"the first baseball ever televised on a truly national basis\", as coast-to-coast cable had just been installed. Moreover, the game was broadcast nationally on the radio and to \"hundreds of thousands of American military personnel stationed 'round the world' who heard 'the shot' on Armed Forces Radio.\"\nThe circumstances of the Giants winning the 1951 N.L. pennant are also referred to as the \"Miracle of Coogan’s Bluff\", which was used as the headline in the \"Herald Tribune\" the day after the game. However, \"Shot Heard ‘Round the World\" stuck as the primary epithet for Thomson's home run.\n\"Miracle of Coogan’s Bluff\" has also been used to describe the Giants' 1951 season as a whole. The team overcame a seemingly insurmountable deficit of 13 games in the National League standings on August 11 to force the three-game playoff series against the Dodgers.\nSign stealing by the Giants.\nIn ensuing years, rumors began to circulate that during the second half of the 1951 season, the Giants engaged in systematic sign stealing—stealing the finger signals transmitted from catcher to pitcher that determine the pitch to be thrown. The Associated Press reported the rumor in 1962, but with no specifics, and based on an anonymous source. In 2001, many of the 21 Giants players still alive at the time, and one surviving coach, told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that beginning on July 20, the team used a telescope in the Giants clubhouse behind center field, manned by infielder Hank Schenz and later by coach Herman Franks, to steal the finger signals of opposing catchers. Stolen signs were relayed via a buzzer wire connected from the clubhouse to telephones in the Giants dugout and bullpen—one buzz for a fastball, two for an off-speed pitch. \"Every hitter knew what was coming,\" said pitcher Al Gettel. \"Made a big difference.\" Joshua Prager, the author of the \"Journal\" article, outlined the evidence in greater detail in a 2006 book.\nAlthough backup catcher Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed Rube Walker's fastball sign to Thomson from the bullpen, Thomson repeatedly insisted that he was concentrating on the situation, and did not take the sign. Branca made no public comment at the time. \"I made a decision not to speak about it,\" he said. \"I didn't want to look like I was crying over spilled milk.\" Later he told \"The New York Times\", \"I didn't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew what was coming, he had to hit it ... Knowing the pitch doesn't always help.\" In another interview, Branca pointed out that luck and circumstance were involved as well; had the coin toss gone the other way, Thomson's Shot would not have been a home run at Ebbets Field—nor would the game-winner he hit in the first playoff game have been a homer at the Polo Grounds.\nWhether the telescope-and-buzzer system contributed significantly to the Giants' late-season 37–7 win streak remains a subject of debate. Prager notes in his book that sign stealing was not specifically forbidden by MLB rules at the time and, moral issues aside, \"...has been a part of baseball since its inception\". Sign stealing using optical or other mechanical aids was outlawed by MLB in 1961.\nArtifacts.\nSome of the artifacts from the historic moment have been preserved. Thomson's game bat and shoes are the centerpieces of an exhibit dedicated to the Shot at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The exhibit is one of the Hall's most popular attractions, according to curators.\nThomson's game jersey is most likely in the collection of Dan Scheinman, a collector who owns a small minority stake in the Giants. In 2005, he bought two 1951 jerseys—one home and one road—from Thomson, who told him that he had worn them in the World Series, but could not remember whether he had worn the home jersey for the Shot game. Scheinman has said that he is \"about 90 percent\" confident that the home jersey is indeed the one Thomson was wearing when he hit the Shot: The Giants almost certainly wore the same uniforms for the Series—which began the day after the Shot game—that they used during the second half of the season (as did the Yankees), and Scheinman's jersey displays distinct puckering around the numbers, probably as a result of steam pressing, that is visible in photos of Thomson taken during and immediately after the Shot game. According to a professional textile conservator, such puckering cannot be mimicked or reproduced, and would not repeat itself in exactly the same pattern on a different jersey.\nThe location of the ball is unknown. Documentary filmmaker and author Brian Biegel attempted unsuccessfully to authenticate a vintage baseball, autographed by several 1951 Giants, that his father had purchased at a thrift store for four dollars, and believed to be Thomson's home run ball. He chronicled the project in his 2011 book \"Miracle Ball\", followed by a documentary film of the same name.\nLegacy.\nThe Shot game placed second on ESPN's \"SportsCentury\" ranking of the Ten Greatest Games of the 20th Century, behind the 1958 NFL Championship Game. \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked Thomson's home run fifteenth on its list of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History.\nThe event was recreated in Don DeLillo's story \"Pafko at the Wall\", subtitled \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\", originally published as a folio in the October 1992 issue of \"Harper's Magazine\" and re-released in 2001 as a novella. DeLillo recreates the game through the perspective of various witnesses, among them Frank Sinatra, Jackie Gleason and J. Edgar Hoover. The story grew into DeLillo's 1997 novel, \"Underworld\", in which the fate of the ball is a central focus of subsequent events spread across decades.\nIn her memoir \"Wait Till Next Year\", about her childhood as a Dodger fan, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin writes that \"From that moment to this, Bobby Thomson and the Brooklyn Dodgers would be forever linked, the mere mention of his name calling forth in every Dodger fan instant recognition, comradeship, a memory of where they were, how they felt. I now live in the town of Concord, Massachusetts, not far from the Old North Bridge, where the American Revolution began. Whenever I take visitors to see the monument, and stand before the marble shaft, reading that lovely inscription which commemorates 'the shot heard round the world,' I think privately of Bobby Thomson's home run.\""

        "title": "Arthur Gore (tennis)",
        "text": "Arthur William Charles Wentworth Gore (2 January 1868 – 1 December 1928) was a British tennis player.\nHe is best known for winning three singles titles at the Wimbledon Championship and was runner-up a record 5 times (shared with Herbert Lawford). He also won gold medals at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England, winning the Men's Indoor Singles and the Men's Indoor Doubles (with Herbert Barrett). He also competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. Gore's Wimbledon win in 1909, at age 41, makes him the oldest player to date to hold the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles title.\nCareer.\nHe played his first tournament at London Athletic Club in 1887, and his first title came at a grass court tournament in Stevenage in August 1888. Gore won the singles title at the Scottish Championships in 1892 and successfully defended the title in the Challenge Round in 1893. In 1894 he won the North London Championships on grass, an event at that tournament that he won five times (1894, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1906). He won the singles title at the Kent Championships on two occasions; in 1900 by defeating Harold Mahony in the final in straight sets and in 1906 against A.L. Bentley, also in straight sets. In 1900 and 1908 he won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, played at the Queen's Club in London. In May 1908 he won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, played at the Queen's Club in London, defeating New Zealander Anthony Wilding in the Challenge Round in four sets.

Cook relied on a heavy sinker, which he threw more than 70% of the time and induced ground balls at an average 64% of the time. His sinker was considered by many hitters like trying to hit an anvil falling, as it bottomed out at the end. His response to his style of pitching had always been: \"I'm a pitch to contact guy, I may not be a flashy pitcher because I don't get the K's. I work quick and I make hitters make contact on my sinker and induce the ground ball\".\nHis repertoire also included a curveball, a changeup and a cutter he added in 2010."

        "text": "James Forrester (born 9 February 1981 in Oxford) is a former English rugby union player who played at number eight for Gloucester Rugby.\nForrester is a tall, agile, talented number eight with excellent ball handling skills and an eye for the try line, as his impressive try tally for Gloucester Rugby demonstrates. Born in Oxford, he learnt his rugby at school and as a mini/junior with Bicester Rugby Club. During his time at St Edward's School, Oxford, he also developed his game and although disappointed at missing out on an England U18 Group Schools cap in 1999, he had more than made up for it by the end of that year when he signed for Gloucester Rugby. Whilst at Gloucester he started in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Rugby, and the 2003 Powergen Cup Final in which he scored a try when Gloucester defeated Northampton Saints.\nIn 2003 Forrester was named PRA Premiership Young Player of the Year as well as Sports Writers Young Player of the year. He was also named in the 37 man training squad for the 2003 World cup before a wrist injury and surgery ruled him unavailable.\nHaving played for England U21 he made his England A debut against Wales in Bristol during 2002 and in June of that year also played for an England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham, scoring a memorable 65-metre try and outstripping Jonah Lomu in the process.\nHe was also capped by the England Sevens squad in 2002, playing in the opening World Series tournament in Dubai and two others and was man of the match with two tries, when England A thrashed Scotland 78–6 in March 2003. He was considered an outside chance for Clive Woodward's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad but was ultimately left out.\nUnfortunately, injury has affected his career and he required an elbow operation in 2002–03 and then dislocated his shoulder in 2003–04 in the England A match against France A. In the summer of 2004 he signed a three-year contract to stay at Kingsholm. In 2005 he sneaked his first England cap, against Wales in the RBS 6 Nations, coming on as a blood replacement for Joe Worsley. His second cap came as a replacement in November 2005 against Samoa. Forrester has shown his versatility, in that he has played in all three back-row positions plus centre, including in Gloucester Rugby's 16–24 defeat in the Zurich Premiership wildcard final against Saracens on 14 May 2005. The week previously he scored 2 tries from centre against Newcastle.\nOn Sunday 21 May 2006 Forrester clinched the European Challenge Cup for Gloucester Rugby with a superb try in extra time at The Stoop. Forrester made an impressive start to the following season scoring 3 tries in 3 games, one of which was against Harlequins at The Stoop again. After a horrific injury towards the end of this season at Ashton Gate Stadium he missed the entire 2007/08 season. On 10 October 2008, it was announced on the Gloucester rugby website that he was to retire with immediate effect as a consequence of this injury.\nIn late 2008 Gloucester awarded Forrester a Testimonial dinner.\nIn 2009, Forrester relocated to Singapore with his family where he coached Singapore Premiership team Wanderers to victory, 4 years in a row 2013–2016. Additionally he took up the role of Head Coach for the Singapore Rugby Union Men's 15's &amp; 7's.\nIn 2013 led Singapore to promotion from division two with a win against a very strong Malaysian side in the final.\nIn 2014 led Singapore to victory over UAE a team who had finished 2nd in Asia 2 years before. This win guaranteed our place in Div 1 for next year. Unfortunately Singapore had no opportunity to gain promotion as IRB changed the league structure the following year.\nIn 2011, Forrester launched his own fitness business, UFIT. Initially starting with boot camps, personal training and nutrition consultancy. Later, he opened two Crossfit boxes in Singapore, Crossfit Bukit Timah and Crossfit Tanjong Pagar.\nIn 2015, UFIT Bootcamps merged with its largest bootcamp rival in Singapore, OZFIT, culminating in UFITs SHEFIT brand. Later that year UFIT opened its 4th facility UFIT One north.\nIn 2016, UFIT Clinic was born, offering physiotherapy, rehabilitation and sports psychology to clients in Singapore. The most recent addition to UFIT's offerings is UFIT Education &amp; UFIT Academy. UFIT Education trains and develops fitness professionals and offers schools and businesses the opportunity to upskill.

He won the 1984 Canada Cup with Team Canada.\nPlaying career.\nAfter a junior hockey career for the Ottawa 67's in the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League, Wilson was drafted in the first round, sixth overall, in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft. He then played 14 seasons with the Chicago Black Hawks and two years for the San Jose Sharks in the National Hockey League. He was the first captain in Sharks history, serving two years before retiring after the 1992–93 season.\nWilson played 14 seasons in Chicago and still ranks as the club's highest-scoring defenceman in points (779 — sixth overall), goals (225 — 12th overall) and assists (554 — third overall). Wilson is fifth all-time in games played (938) for Chicago. He also led all Blackhawks defencemen in scoring for 10 consecutive seasons (1980–81 through 1990–91). In 1982, he was awarded the James Norris Memorial Trophy, as the League's top defenceman. That year, he had 39 goals and 85 points, which are still the Blackhawks single-season records for goals and points by a defenceman.\nHe was selected to eight NHL All-Star Games (seven with Chicago and one with San Jose). While with Chicago, Wilson was named as an NHL First Team All-Star in 1982 and twice was named as an NHL Second Team All-Star (1985 and 1990).\nWilson agreed to waive his no-trade clause and was acquired by San Jose from Chicago just before the Sharks first season (1991–92) for prospect Kerry Toporowski and San Jose's 2nd round choice in the 1992 NHL draft. Wilson brought instant credibility and respect to the young franchise. He played two seasons for the Sharks, scoring 48 points (12 goals, 36 assists) in 86 games.\nOther career highlights include serving as the franchise's first team captain (1991–93), being the team's first representative in an All-Star Game (1991–92), playing in his NHL-milestone 1,000th game on November 21, 1992, (77th player in League history) and twice named Sharks nominee (1992 and 1993) for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy (for leadership and humanitarian contributions both on-and off-the-ice).

Before that, he had been one of two eligible Norris Trophy winners (along with Randy Carlyle) outside of the Hall of Fame.\nRetirement and executive career.\nIn 2004, Wilson was named to the Positive Coaching Alliance's National Advisory Board. PCA, established at Stanford University in 1998, tries to create a positive character-building experience by using sports to teach life lessons. The \"win-at-all-costs\" mentality is de-emphasized in PCA.\nWilson was inducted into the Chicago Sports Hall of Fame in September 1999. He also serves on the NHL's board of directors for the alumni association.\nIn October 1998, the Ottawa 67s honored his career by retiring his No. 7 sweater. Known as an offensive defenceman, he recorded 295 points in 194 OHL games with the 67s from 1975 to 1977. In addition, during the same weekend of activities in his hometown, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame.\nThe San Jose Sharks hired Wilson as general manager on May 13, 2003, replacing Dean Lombardi, who had been dismissed on March 18. As general manager, Wilson was credited with building the Sharks into a perennially competitive team, reaching their first Stanley Cup Finals in 2016. On April 7, 2022, Wilson stepped down from the position permanently to focus on his health, having been on medical leave since November 26, 2021, following two months of a non-COVID-19 related persistent cough; assistant general manager Joe Will filled in for the remainder of the season. On July 5, 2022, still dealing with his undisclosed illness, Wilson retired, with former San Jose Shark Mike Grier replacing him as general manager.\nHe spent a further year away from hockey before resuming his career in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins on September 6, 2023 as Senior Advisor of Hockey Operations.

He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers, earning national college player of the year honors from the Associated Press (AP) and United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) as a senior in 2003. West was a two-time NBA All-Star (2008 and 2009) and a two-time NBA champion (2017 and 2018).\nHigh school and college career.\nWest attended Garner Magnet High School in Garner, North Carolina and Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia. As a senior in 1998–99, he earned first-team all-state honors playing for Hargrave.\nIn his freshman season at Xavier, West was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team after leading the A-10 in rebounding (9.1) and finishing fourth on the Musketeers in scoring (11.7).\nIn his sophomore season, West led Xavier in scoring (17.8 ppg), rebounding (10.9 rpg, tops in A-10 and fourth nationally) and blocks (2.1 bpg). He recorded five 20-point, 20-rebound games throughout the 2000–01 season as he earned his first A-10 Player of the Year award.\nIn his junior season, West was named the A-10 Player of the Year and the league's Defensive Player of the Year, while also winning A-10 Tournament MVP honors.

In addition, he became just the third player in Xavier history to surpass 2,000 points and only the second to eclipse 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds, joining Tyrone Hill.\nIn October 2007, \"Sports Illustrated\" released \"Sports Illustrated: The Basketball Book\", which featured West on its NCAA All-Decade Team for the decade beginning in 2000. He was joined by Connecticut's Emeka Okafor and three Duke players, Jay Williams, J. J. Redick and Shane Battier.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Hornets (2003–2011).\nWest was drafted by the New Orleans Hornets with the 18th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. After recording modest production in his first two seasons, in 2005–06, West enjoyed a breakthrough as he averaged 17.4 points and 7.4 rebounds with a .512 FG% in 74 games. That year, he finished second in the voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, behind Boris Diaw of the Phoenix Suns. He also saw some time at center, due to the team's lack of a true big man and demonstrated an ability to perform under pressure, as he converted three game-winning jump shots.\nIn 2006–07, West ended the season averaging 18.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game. Despite missing 30 games due to an elbow injury, West recorded five games of 30 or more points and 13 games of 20 or more points.\nWest again increased his statistical production in 2007–08, and was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, along with teammate Chris Paul. Paul later stated that he would rather not play with a power forward in the league other than West, because \"he's not in it for the spotlight, all he cares about is getting buckets [scoring].\" West reinforced his desire to be a team player in a 2008 postseason interview, saying that he does not care about being overlooked but would rather \"play and be as effective as possible\" when he is out on the court.\nIn 2008–09, West repeated as an all-star and posted a new career high by scoring 21.0 points per game.\nOn March 25, 2011, during one of the Hornets' last games of the season against the Utah Jazz, West came down awkwardly after a dunk. The event occurred with 22.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter.

In June 2015, he opted out of his contract with the Pacers to become a free agent.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2015–2016).\nOn July 17, 2015, West signed with the San Antonio Spurs. He made his debut for the Spurs in the team's season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on October 28, recording 8 points and 2 rebounds off the bench in a 112–106 loss. On January 6, 2016, West, starting in place of LaMarcus Aldridge, recorded season-highs of 18 points and 13 rebounds in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular-season games dating to 2014–15.\nGolden State Warriors (2016–2018).\nOn July 9, 2016, West signed with the Golden State Warriors. West emerged as a key bench player for the Warriors, particularly for his skilled passing abilities. Throughout January and February 2017, West missed 14 games with a non-displaced fracture in his left thumb. On March 29, 2017, West recorded a season-high 15 points and a game-high plus-23 in a large comeback win against the San Antonio Spurs. The Warriors finished the season as the first seed in the West with a 67–15 record. Following a 129–115 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals over the Spurs, the Warriors were undefeated in the first three playoff series, reaching their third straight NBA Finals series. West played in every playoff game, as the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–1 in the 2017 NBA Finals. The Warriors' 16–1 playoff record was the best ever postseason winning percentage in NBA history.\nOn July 25, 2017, after winning his first championship ring, West re-signed with the Warriors for one more year, with expectations to retire after the 2017–18 season. On January 8, 2018, in a 124–114 win over the Denver Nuggets, West became the 127th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 regular-season games. After reaching that milestone, he noted that he might consider signing again for the 2018–19 season, saying, \"It all depends on how my body feels. Right now I feel good.\" After winning his second NBA Championship, West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons on August 30, 2018.\nExecutive career.\nIn November 2018, West became the first Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Historical Basketball League (HBL), a college basketball league set to launch in 2020. The HBL later changed its name to The Professional Collegiate League, with West explaining that the organization produces a more equitable system to \"challenge the exploitation at the collegiate basketball level. ... Predominantly young black men, working, not being paid for their labor, and that labor being directly, monetarily beneficial for everyone but them.\"\nPersonal life.\nWest is the son of Amos and Harriet West. He and his wife Lesley have one daughter, Dasia, and one son, David Benjamin.\nWest is very interested in education, \"black history, philosophy and various societal issues\". He also loves to make mixtapes for his teammates, saying that it is a healthy habit that keeps him \"in the house and off [his] feet\".\nWest has a Xavier \"X\" tattooed on his arm which displays, on either side, \"My life, my way\".\nPolitical views.\nIn mid-2019, West appeared as a panelist and commentator on \"The Young Turks\" political news program to discuss Juneteenth.\nIn a July 2020 interview with \"Black Agenda Report\", West lamented the lack of understanding about China among Americans and denounced anti-China foreign policy hawks as \"warmongers.\" Regarding the NBA's rift with China following Daryl Morey's tweet supporting the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, West stated that the Hong Kong issue is more complicated than how it is portrayed in the American media, and that he contacted NBA players to caution them about being used as political pawns against China, stating: \"I got on the phone with a bunch of NBA guys, and I was like 'Don't let them pull you into this bullshit, because it's the Iraq war-, weapons of mass destruction-type propaganda again.\" Regarding the manner in which China is presented in the American media, West stated: \"As people in the world, as Americans and people in American society, we have been misled.\"\nConcerning American politics, West expressed support for Medicare for All and stated that American society needs a fundamental restructuring in order to combat police brutality, food deserts, and discrimination against black people in the healthcare industry. He stated that America has an \"imperial lust that we haven't been able to get rid of,\" adding that \"it has put us behind other nations in the fact that nations are united internally against the imperial wishes of the United States.\" West praised China for its improvements in poverty elimination, education, and life expectancy, and stated that China has \"built their society in a way to defend itself against the constant imposition of Western imperialism. And in the midst of all of that, they have still been able to eke out some of the greatest advancements in human history. ... They've done it without war, they've done it without invasion, they've done it without bombing and blowing people up.\" He elaborated further that China demonstrates \"there could be a functioning society outside of the control of the Western imperial power structure.\""

        "text": "The Major League Baseball draft (officially the Rule 4 draft; also known as the First Year Player Draft) is the primary mechanism of Major League Baseball (MLB) for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on a lottery where the teams who did not make the postseason in the past year participate in a state-lottery style process to determine the first six picks, starting in 2023. The team possessing the worst record receives the best odds of receiving the first pick. Until 2022, it was determined by the previous season's standings, with the worst team selecting first.\nThe first amateur draft was held in 1965. Unlike most sports drafts, the first-year player draft is held mid-season, in July since 2021. Another distinguishing feature of this draft in comparison with those of other North American major professional sports leagues is its sheer size: under the current collective bargaining agreement, the draft lasts until 20 rounds in addition to, since 2021, compensatory picks. It lasted up to 40 rounds until 2019. In contrast, the NFL Draft lasts for only seven rounds (260 selections), the NHL Entry Draft lasts for seven rounds (224 selections), the MLS SuperDraft lasts for only three rounds (87 selections), and the NBA draft lasts for only two rounds (60 selections).\nOn March 26, 2020, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached a deal that included the option to shorten that year's draft to five rounds, and halve the 2021 draft to 20 rounds. On March 10, 2022, after the two entities came to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement, the first round order will be based firstly on a lottery participated by 18 non-postseason teams that determines the first six picks in the draft, starting with the 2023 edition, and secondly on the results of playoff teams. Subsequent rounds will be determined by the preceding season's win-loss records for the first 18 selections in each round, followed also by playoff finishes.\nBefore the draft.\nMajor League Baseball has used a draft to assign minor league players to teams since 1921. In 1936, the National Football League held the first amateur draft in professional sports. A decade later, the National Basketball Association instituted a similar method of player distribution. However, the player draft was controversial. Congressman Emanuel Celler questioned the legality of drafts during a series of hearings on the business practice of professional sports leagues in the 1950s. Successful clubs saw the draft as anti-competitive. Yankees executive Johnny Johnson equated it with communism. At the same time, Pulitzer Prize-winning sports columnist Arthur Daley compared the system to a \"slave market.\"\nPrior to the implementation of the first-year player draft, amateurs were free to sign with any Major League team that offered them a contract. As a result, wealthier teams such as the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals were able to stockpile young talent, while poorer clubs were left to sign less desirable prospects.\nIn 1947, Major League Baseball implemented the bonus rule, a restriction aimed at reducing player salaries, as well as keeping wealthier teams from monopolizing the player market. In its most restrictive form, it forbade any team which gave an amateur a signing bonus of more than $4,000 from assigning that player to a minor league affiliate for two seasons. If the player was removed from the major league roster, he became a free agent. The controversial rule was repealed twice, only to be re-instituted.\nThe bonus rule was largely ineffective. There were accusations that teams were signing players to smaller bonuses, only to supplement them with under-the-table payments. In one famous incident, the Kansas City Athletics signed Clete Boyer, kept him on their roster for two years, then traded him to the Yankees just as he became eligible to be sent to the minor leagues. Other clubs accused the Yankees of using the Athletics as a de facto farm team, and the A's later admitted to signing Boyer on their behalf. Finally, it was the bidding war for Rick Reichardt, who signed with the Los Angeles Angels for the then outrageous bonus of $200,000, (about $1.8 million today) that led to the implementation of the draft.\nMajor League clubs voted on the draft during the 1964 Winter Meetings. Four teams—the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets—attempted to defeat the proposal, but they failed to convince a majority of teams, and in the end only the Cardinals voted against it.\nThe draft.\nMLB player transactions are governed by \"The Official Professional Baseball Rules Book\", within which, Rule 4 governs the \"First-Year Player Draft\". Due to its place in the rules book, MLB's amateur draft is sometimes referred to as the \"Rule 4 draft\"; there is also a distinctly different Rule 5 draft.\nMajor League Baseball's first amateur draft was held on June 8–9, 1965, in New York City. Teams chose players in reverse order of the previous season's standings, with picks alternating between the National and American Leagues. With the first pick, the Kansas City Athletics took Rick Monday, an outfielder from Arizona State University.\nOriginally, three separate drafts were held each year. The June draft, which was by far the largest, involved new high school graduates, as well as college seniors who had just finished their seasons. Another draft was held in January, which typically involved high school players who graduated in the winter, junior college players, and players who had dropped out of four-year colleges. Junior college players were required to wait until their current season was completed before they could sign. Finally, there was a draft in August for players who participated in amateur summer leagues. The August draft was eliminated after only two years, while the January draft lasted until 1986.\nInfluence of the draftee's age.\nEarly on, the majority of players drafted came directly from high school. Between 1967 and 1971, only seven college players were chosen in the first round of the June draft. However, the college players who were drafted outperformed their high school counterparts by what statistician Bill James called \"a laughably huge margin.\" By 1978, a majority of draftees had played college baseball, and by 2002, the number rose above sixty percent. While the number of high school players drafted has dropped, those picked have been more successful than their predecessors. In a study of drafts from 1984 to 1999, \"Baseball Prospectus\" writer Rany Jazayerli concluded that, by the 1990s, the gap in production between the two groups had nearly disappeared. In October 2011, Jazayerli presented another research study which included an analysis of those players drafted since 1965, but instead of breaking them into college or high school draftees, he segregated them by their age on draft day. In the study published in \"Baseball Prospectus\", which included a follow-up article of the financial benefits, Jazayerli concluded that the very young players return more value than expected by their draft slots. In Jazayerli's study he looked at the statistics and broke draftees into five distinctive groups based on their age and being drafted in the early rounds. Jazayerli's defined a “very young” player as those who are younger than 17 years and 296 days on draft day. Since the inception of the draft, the youngest player ever drafted in an early round is Alfredo Escalera. Escalera was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the eighth round of the 2012 draft at 17 years and 114 days. Jazayerli's study does not clearly demonstrate the influence of the player's age when drafted in a late round.\nEconomic impact.\nInitially, the draft succeeded in reducing the value of signing bonuses. In 1964, a year before the first draft, University of Wisconsin outfielder Rick Reichardt was given a record bonus of $200,000 ($1,798,722 today) by the Los Angeles Angels. Without competition from other clubs, the Athletics were able to sign Rick Monday for a bonus of only $104,000. It would take until 1979 when USC pitcher Bill Bordley received a bonus higher than Reichardt's.\nPlayer salaries continued to escalate through the 1980s. In 1986, Bo Jackson became the first draftee to sign a total contract (signing bonus and salary) worth over $1 million ($ today). Jackson, a Heisman Trophy-winning football player for Auburn University, was also the first overall choice in the National Football League draft, and was offered a $7 million ($ today) contract to play football for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nHigh school players possessed additional leverage, as they had the option of attending college and re-entering the draft the next year. Agent Scott Boras routinely exploited this advantage to increase the contracts of his clients. In 1990, Boras client Todd Van Poppel signed a $1.2 million ($ today) contract with Oakland Athletics, after committing to play for the University of Texas. The following year, Boras negotiated a $1.55 million ($ today) contract for Yankees first round pick Brien Taylor, who had said he would attend junior college if he did not receive a contract equal to Van Poppel's. By June 2009, a figure as high as $15 million was floated for collegian pitcher Stephen Strasburg.\nIncreasingly, teams drafted based on whether or not a player was likely to sign for a particular amount of money, rather than on his talent. This became known as a \"signability pick\". Before the 1992 draft, team owners unilaterally decided to extend the period of time a team retained negotiating rights to a player from one year to five. In effect, the rule prohibited a high school draftee from attending college and re-entering the draft after his junior or senior seasons. The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a legal challenge, but Major League Baseball argued that, since the Players Association did not represent amateur players, it was not necessary for the union to agree to the change. An arbitrator ultimately decided that any change to draft articles must be negotiated with the Players Association.\nMedia exposure.\nThe first-year player draft has historically had far less media exposure than its counterparts in the other leagues for three primary reasons:\nThe 2007 draft was the first to be televised live, on June 7, 2007. The draft coverage took place at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida. Since the 2009 draft, the first round of the draft has been broadcast annually on MLB Network live and in prime time from its studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, with ESPN simulcasting the first round since 2020. Since the 2021 draft, the event takes place during All-Star Weekend.\nProcedures and rules.\nEligibility.\nTo be drafted, a player must fit the following criteria:\nDraft order.\nFrom the 2023 draft, as part of the new collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the general draft order in the first round will be based on a lottery participated by 18 teams which did not make the postseason in the past season to determine the first six picks in the draft, with the three worst clubs having an equal chance of winning the top overall pick, and secondly by the finishes of playoff clubs, i.e., Wild Card Game losers down to the World Series winner. Additionally, within each playoff group, teams will be sorted by revenue-sharing status and then reverse order of winning percentage. In each subsequent round, the first 18 selections are still determined by the preceding season's standings and the remaining picks are also based on the postseason clubs' results. Revenue-sharing recipient teams are limited to receiving lottery picks in two consecutive drafts and non-recipients can get one of the top six selections in a single draft year only. Also, a lottery-ineligible, non-postseason club can only select 10th overall or lower. The 2022 CBA ratified the draft's reduction to 20 rounds.\nThe order was the reverse order of the previous year's standings, until 2022. If two teams finished with identical records, the previous year's standings of the two teams was the tiebreaker, with the team having a worse record receiving the higher pick.\nNegotiating rights.\nPrior to 2007, a team retained the rights to sign a selected player until one week prior to the next draft, or until the player enters, or returns to, a four-year college on a full-time basis. This was known as the \"draft and follow\" procedure.\nSince 2012, the deadline for signing a drafted player is July 15. A selected player who enters a junior college cannot be signed until the conclusion of the school's baseball season. A player who is drafted and does not sign with the club that selected him may be drafted again at a future year's draft, so long as the player is eligible for that year's draft. A club may not select a player again in a subsequent year, unless the player has consented to the re-selection.\nA player who is eligible to be selected and is passed over by every club becomes a free agent and may sign with any club, up until one week before the next draft, or until the player enters, or returns to, a four-year college full-time or enters, or returns to, a junior college. In the one-week period before any draft, which is called the \"closed period\", the general rule is that no club may sign a new player.\nThe 2022 CBA reinstated the draft-and-follow option for players drafted after the 10th round who opt to attend junior college and are eligible to sign with their drafting clubs before the following draft.\nCompensatory picks.\nCurrently, teams can earn compensatory picks in the draft based on departing free agents who reject a Qualifying Offer from their respective team. A qualifying offer is defined as a one-year contract worth the average value of the top 120 player contracts for that year (in 2015, the value of the qualifying offer was $15.8 million). The 2013 draft saw major changes to the compensation rules. This was implemented as part of the previous CBA between MLB and its players' union, which took effect with the 2012 season.\nPre-2013 rules.\nBefore the 2013 draft, free agents were ranked by the Elias Sports Bureau based on their previous two years of playing, and against players of similar positions. Players were categorized as either Type A or Type B, or fell into the category of all other players. Below is a description of each free agent class and the compensation the free agent's former team received when the player signed with a different team.\nTo earn a compensatory pick, a free agent must have been either signed before the arbitration deadline in early December, or offered arbitration by their former team but still signed with another team.\nCompensatory picks that one team gave another via this method were the highest available pick that team had, with the exception of picks in the top half of the first round. These picks were protected from being used as compensation. If a team that picked in the top half of the first draft signed a Type A free agent, they would give up their second-round pick. If a team owed two other teams draft picks via Type A free agents, the team whose departing player had a higher score got the higher-ranked pick. A team could not lose picks it earned via compensation. The post-2012 rules for this aspect of the draft are similar, except that the \"Type A\" and \"Type B\" designations no longer exist (see below).\nThe order of the supplemental round between the first and second rounds, a feature that remains in place in 2013 and beyond, is determined by inverse order of the previous year's standings. Under pre-2013 rules, Type A picks were made first, and then the order reset for all the Type B compensation picks.\nIn a feature that did not change with the old CBA in 2012, teams can also earn compensation for unsigned picks from the previous year's draft. If a team doesn't sign a first or second round pick, they will get to pick at the same slot plus one the following year. For example, if the team with the No. 5 pick does not sign that player, they would have the No. 6 pick the following year. The regular draft order would continue around those picks. For compensation for not signing a third round pick, teams would get a pick in a supplemental round between the third and fourth rounds. If a team fails to sign a player with one of these compensated picks, there is no compensation the following year.\nCurrent rules.\nFor the 2012 draft, the previous \"Type A\" and \"Type B\" designations remained in place, but the CBA included special provisions that modified the statuses of 11 players who were Type A free agents under the 2007 CBA. Six of these were \"Modified Type A\"—meaning that the signing team did not forfeit a draft pick, but the player's former team received a compensatory pick in the same position it would have earned under regular Type A rules. The remaining five were \"Modified Type B\", with compensation identical to that for other Type B free agents.\nSince the 2013 draft, free agents are no longer classified by \"type\". Instead, a team is only able to receive compensation if it makes its former player an offer at least equal to the average of the 125 richest contracts. However, if a player is traded during the final season of his contract, his new team will be ineligible to receive any compensation.\nStarting with the 2023 draft, the 2022 CBA provides for the awarding of compensatory draft picks under the following:\nOther changes from 2012.\nThe previous CBA introduced other significant changes to the draft.\nBonus pool.\nFrom the 2012 draft on, each team is allocated a \"bonus pool\" from which it can offer initial contracts to its drafted players. Each team's pool is based on its draft position and number of picks, plus the amount spent in the previous year's draft. For the 2012 draft, these pools ranged from $4.5 million to $11.5 million. If a team goes over its threshold by 5 percent or less, it must pay a \"luxury tax\" of 75% on the amount over the threshold. Teams that go 5 to 10 percent over must pay a 100% tax on the excess, and will lose their next first-round pick. A team that goes 15 percent over can lose its next two first-round picks, in addition to the \"luxury tax\". These excess picks will go to smaller-revenue teams via a yet-to-be-reported formula. Uniquely, these compensatory picks can be traded—marking the first time MLB has allowed trading of draft picks. However, all previous rules against trading of regular picks, or picks awarded as free agent compensation, remain in force.\nNew signing rules.\nTeams can no longer offer major league contracts to their draft choices—only minor league contracts are available. The only exception is for drafted players who have scholarships in other sports. Also, the date for signing new picks has moved from mid-August to mid-July. However, the deadline was moved to early August in 2021 to compensate for the new date of the MLB Draft."

        "text": "Andrei Viktorovich Markov (; born 20 December 1978) is a Russian-Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. Nicknamed \"the General\", Markov formerly played from 2000 to 2017 with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He holds both Russian and Canadian citizenship.\nPlaying career.\nMarkov was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. After being considered one of the best defencemen in Russia in 2000, he came over to North America and split time with the Canadiens and their then-minor league affiliate, the Quebec Citadelles of the American Hockey League (AHL). After rounding out his defensive game, he became a regular in the Canadiens' starting line-up and was widely considered to be their most complete defenceman.\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Markov played in his native Russia with Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague (RSL).\nMarkov signed a four-year contract with the Canadiens on 28 May 2007, keeping him with the team through the 2010–11 season. He had a career year in the 2007–08 season, and was selected to his first NHL All-Star Game as a starter, in Atlanta.\nOn 1 October 2009, Markov suffered a lacerated ankle injury after colliding with teammate Carey Price's skate and was initially expected to be out of the Canadiens' lineup until February 2010. Markov made a full recovery almost two months ahead of schedule and returned to action on 19 December 2009, when the Canadiens faced the New York Islanders. Markov ended up jump-starting the Habs' offence with two goals in his return en route to a 3–0 victory. During the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins on 30 April, Markov suffered a leg injury after being hit by Matt Cooke.\nOn 16 July 2010, Markov became a Canadian citizen. During the 2010–11 season, he played only seven games, earning three points (one goal and two assists). On 13 November 2010, Markov suffered a knee injury in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes and underwent surgery 8 December 2010, missing the remainder of the season.\nOn 23 June 2011, Markov signed a three-year contract with the Canadiens. On 10 March 2012, he played in his first game in over a year, tallying an assist in a 4–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. On 23 June 2014, Markov re-signed with the Canadiens to a three-year contract worth an annual average value of $5.75 million. On 15 September 2014, Markov was named an alternate captain for the Canadiens, along with P. K. Subban, Tomáš Plekanec and Max Pacioretty, sharing the leadership duties of a Canadiens squad currently without a team captain. On 18 September 2015, it was announced that Markov and Brendan Gallagher would serve as alternate captains for Max Pacioretty.\nOn 26 July 2017 it was announced that Andrei Markov would not be returning to Montreal Canadiens for the 2017–2018 season after spending his entire NHL career with the team and playing 990 games over 16 years. Two days later, on 28 July, it was announced that Markov had agreed to a two-year deal with the KHL's Ak Bars Kazan. Markov's team would go on to win the Gagarin Cup in his first season in the KHL.\nOn 16 April 2020 Andrei Markov announced his retirement from professional hockey."

        "text": "The Cayman Islands national cricket team is the team that represents the British overseas territory of the Cayman Islands in international cricket. The team is organised by the Cayman Islands Cricket Association, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2002, having previously been an affiliate member since 1997.\nThe Cayman Islands debuted internationally at the 2000 Americas Cricket Cup in Canada, and later that year were invited to appear in the 2000–01 Red Stripe Bowl (the West Indian domestic limited-overs competition), where matches had list-A status. During the early 2000s, the Caymans often competed with Bermuda as the third-best team in the ICC Americas region, behind Canada and the United States. When the U.S. was suspended from the 2005 Intercontinental Cup, they were replaced by the Cayman Islands, with the team being afforded the opportunity to make its first-class debut.\nIn 2006 and 2008, the Cayman Islands played in the Stanford 20/20 tournament (where matches had full Twenty20 status). In the World Cricket League (WCL), Cayman Islands debuted in Division Three in 2007 but subsequently fell as low as Division Six before the WCL was abolished. The Caymans currently play in ICC Americas regional qualification tournaments.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Cayman Islands and any other ICC member after 1 January 2019 are eligible for T20I status.\nHistory.\nThe Cayman Islands became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1997 and played their first tournament three years later when they played in the ICC Americas Championship in Canada. They finished fourth in the tournament, their only win coming against Argentina. Later in the year, they played their first List A matches as part of the 2000–01 Red Stripe Bowl in the West Indies. They played against Bermuda, Guyana, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands in the first round, losing all their games.\nThe Cayman Islands gained associate membership of the ICC in 2002, a year in which they finished third in the Americas Championship in Buenos Aires, Argentina after recording wins against Argentina, the Bahamas and Bermuda. The 2004 Americas Championship served as a qualifying competition for the 2005 ICC Trophy, and a repeat of their third-place finish from 2002 would have qualified them for that tournament. Wins against Argentina and the Bahamas meant they could only finish fourth however. This did qualify them for a place in a repêchage tournament in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They finished fifth in that tournament after beating Kuwait in a play-off match.\nLater in 2005, the Cayman Islands took part in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, a tournament for ICC associate members with first-class status. They lost both their first round matches to Bermuda and Canada, thus not qualifying for the semi-finals. In 2006, they first played in the inaugural Stanford 20/20 tournament. They beat the Bahamas in the preliminary round, but lost to Trinidad &amp; Tobago in the first round proper.\nIn August 2006, they finished third in Division One of the ICC Americas Championship after wins against Argentina and Canada. This qualified them for 2007 Division Three of the World Cricket League, which was played in May/June 2007 in Darwin, Australia. After beating Hong Kong and Tanzania in the first round, they lost to Argentina in the semi-finals, and to Papua New Guinea in the third place play-off, thus finishing fourth in the tournament. In 2009 they again placed in 2009 Division Three in which they came 5th thus relegating to Division Four. Like Argentina their bad run continued and again finished fifth only winning over Argentina. In 2012, they managed to stop the fall, finishing fourth in 2012 Division Five.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Cayman Islands and other ICC members from 1 January 2019 have been full T20I matches. \nThe Cayman Islands played their first T20I match against Canada on 18 August 2019, after finishing second in the Southern sub region qualification group and advancing to the Regional Final of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Americas Qualifier tournament.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Cayman Islands\n\"Last updated 4 October 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Cayman Islands\nMost T20I wickets for Cayman Islands\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2288.

The outdoor tournament was confirmed once the Östermalm Athletic Grounds were completed in late 1911, with the plans modified to have both indoor and outdoor tournaments.\nSix countries sent players for the covered court competitions, with representatives from Sweden, Great Britain, Denmark, France, Australasia and Bohemia appearing. Included in this lineup was Australasia's only competitor, the New Zealander Anthony Wilding, who was also the reigning Wimbledon gentlemen's champion. The indoor knockout competition started on 5 May, and continued as expected until the semi-final round where Wilding was beaten by Britain's Charles P. Dixon. The British player met Frenchman André Gobert in the final, but Gobert was victorious over the Englishman in straight sets. Wilding took the bronze medal in a playoff against another British player, Arthur Lowe.\nThe outdoors tennis competition saw seventy players enter from twelve nations. However, Great Britain did not enter any competitors as the dates of the outdoor competition clashed with the 1912 Wimbledon Championships despite attempts by the British authorities to convince the Olympic organizing committee to change the dates. Other noted tennis players including Anthony Wilding, André Gobert and Arthur Gore refused to compete at the Olympics and instead attended Wimbledon. The gold and silver medals in the gentlemen's singles ended up being decided between two South Africans, with Charles Winslow and Harold Kitson playing each other. Winslow won the match and the gold medal, 7–5, 4–6, 10–8, 8–6. The duo also competed as a pair in the gentlemen's doubles and took the gold medal, beating the Austrians Felix Pipes and Arthur Zborzil. Marguerite Broquedis of France defeated Dorothea Koring of Germany in the ladies' singles for the gold medal. In the mixed double Koring teamed up with Heinrich Schomburgk to win the gold, the duo defeating Sigrid Fick and Gunnar Setterwall of Sweden in the final.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 82 tennis players (69 men and 13 women) from 14 nations (men from 14 nations - women from 6 nations) competed at the Stockholm Games:"

        "title": "Devon White (baseball)",
        "text": "Devon Markes Whyte (formerly and commonly known as Devon White, born December 29, 1962), nicknamed \"Devo\", is a Jamaican-born American former professional baseball center fielder, best known for his defensive ability at that position. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Milwaukee Brewers. He currently serves as the first base coach for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, but was briefly called up to the Blue Jays as first base coach in 2022.\nEarly life.\nBorn as Devon Whyte in Kingston, Jamaica, his family immigrated to the United States when he was nine years old. However, the paperwork had their family name misspelled as \"White\". His last name was legally changed back to its original spelling in 2003 at the behest of his children, but throughout his baseball playing career, he was known as \"Devon White\" and continues to sign autographs with that spelling. His daughter, Davellyn Whyte, played two seasons of professional basketball in the WNBA.\nWhite attended Park West High School in Manhattan, New York City. White was primarily a basketball player in high school and only began playing baseball after watching New York Yankees and Mets games on television with his father. White received a scholarship offer to play both college basketball and college baseball for the Oklahoma State Cowboys.\nBaseball career.\nCalifornia Angels.\nWhite was drafted by the California Angels in the 6th round of the 1981 draft. He made his major league debut in the late stages of the season for California, but he did not establish himself as a major leaguer until , when he played a full season and hit with power and ran the basepaths with speed. In fact, he hit 24 home runs and stole 32 bases that season; he managed to steal at least fifteen bases and hit fifteen home runs before the All-Star break, and no rookie would do so again until 2022. In , only his second full season, he won his first of seven Gold Gloves.\nOn September 9, 1989, he became one of the few players in baseball history to get on first base then score by stealing second base, third base, and home.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn December 2, , he was traded with Willie Fraser and Marcus Moore to the Toronto Blue Jays for Junior Félix and Luis Sojo.\nWhite won two World Series and five Gold Gloves with the Toronto Blue Jays. With a .336 batting average in his post-season career with the Blue Jays, compared to a .270 regular season average with Toronto, White consistently upped his game to help Toronto reach playoff success.\nIn 1992, White collected 3.9 Defensive Wins Above Replacement, which led the major leagues.\nIn Game 3 of the 1992 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, White was the central part of one of the most famous plays in World Series history. With David Justice batting and runners on first and second base, Justice hit a fly ball which White chased down and caught while jumping into the wall. White then threw the ball to second baseman Roberto Alomar who threw to John Olerud at first to try to double up Terry Pendleton, but Pendleton had already been called out for running past Deion Sanders. Olerud promptly threw the ball to third baseman Kelly Gruber who chased down Sanders, diving and clipping him on the heel with his glove. However the umpire, Bob Davidson, did not see the tag, and called Sanders safe, which cost the Jays the second triple play in World Series history. After the game, Davidson watched the replay and admitted he missed the call.\nWhile playing for the team, White appeared on Canadian children's television show \"Under the Umbrella Tree\", in uniform in what was then known as The Skydome talking with characters Jacob Bluejay and Iggy Iguana, in 1993 episode Baseball Fever.\nFlorida Marlins.\nAfter the 1995 season, White signed with the Florida Marlins and won another World Series in , although he only hit .215 in the playoffs that year.\nLater years.\nHe later played with the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Milwaukee Brewers before retiring in . On April 11, 2000, while leading off for the Dodgers as the first batter in the first game at Oracle Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) in San Francisco, White recorded the first base hit in the ballpark's history, off Giants pitcher Kirk Rueter.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 1941 games over 17 seasons, White posted a .263 batting average (1934-for-7344) with 1125 runs, 378 doubles, 71 triples, 208 home runs, 846 RBI, 346 stolen bases, 541 bases on balls, .319 on-base percentage and .419 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In 49 postseason games including three World Series, White batted .296 (56-for-189) with 27 runs, 12 doubles, 4 triples, 3 home runs, 20 RBI, 7 stolen bases and 19 walks.\nCoaching career.\nIn January 2017, White was hired by the Blue Jays organization to be the hitting coach of the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. In July 2022, White was called up to the Blue Jays as the interim first base coach for incumbent Mark Budzinski who was on bereavement leave.\nPersonal life.\nA cousin of White's, Jayden Hylton, also plays baseball."

        "text": "The 2005–06 UEFA Champions League was the 51st season of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, the UEFA Champions League and the 14th since it was rebranded from the European Cup in 1992. 74 teams from 50 football associations took part, starting with the first qualifying round played on 12 July 2005.\nThe tournament ended with a final between Arsenal and Barcelona at Stade de France, Paris, on 17 May 2006. Barcelona won 2–1 with Juliano Belletti scoring a late winner. Arsenal had taken the lead through a Sol Campbell header in the 37th minute, despite Jens Lehmann being sent off in the 18th minute. Samuel Eto'o brought Barcelona back on level terms in the 76th minute before Belletti scored the winner five minutes later.\nThe defending champions were Liverpool and as they did not qualify by their league position, UEFA gave them special dispensation and allowed them to defend their title from the first qualifying round of the competition. They made the group stage and progressed but were eliminated by Benfica in the first knockout round. From the following season, UEFA reserved a berth in the group stage for the defending champions regardless of their league position.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 74 teams from 49 of the 52 UEFA member associations participated in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic league, Andorra and San Marino). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2004 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1999–2000 to 2003–04.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations may have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nSince the title holder group stage spot was not used as originally intended and was vacated, while extra team (Liverpool) was added to the First qualifying round, the following changes to the default access list were made:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season qualified via league position shown in parentheses. Liverpool qualified as title holders. (TH: Champions League title holders).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nQualifying rounds.\nFirst qualifying round.\nTitle-holders Liverpool, as well as 23 league champions from countries ranked 27 or lower on the 2004 UEFA ranking, were drawn against each other and played two matches, home and away, with the winners advancing to the second qualifying round. Though they finished fifth in the Premier League in 2004–05 (usually only four English teams are allowed in), Liverpool were granted a special exemption by UEFA as the holders, whereby they were placed into the first qualification round.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe 12 winners from the first qualifying round, 10 champions from countries ranked 17–26, and six second–placed teams from countries ranked 10–15 were drawn against each other and played two matches, home and away, with the winners advancing to the third qualifying round.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe 14 winners from the second qualifying round, six champions from countries ranked 11–16, three second–placed teams from countries ranked 7–9, six third–placed teams from countries ranked 1–6, and three fourth–placed teams from countries ranked 1–3 were drawn to play 2 matches, home and away, with the winners advancing to the group stage and losers advancing to the first round of the UEFA Cup.\nGroup stage.\n16 winners from the third qualifying round, 10 champions from countries ranked 1–10, and 6 second-placed teams from countries ranked 1–6 were drawn into 8 groups of 4 teams each. Normally two teams from the same association cannot be drawn in the same group. The only exception is Liverpool because of their abnormal qualification as title holders because not having finished in the top four of the English league, Liverpool were not given \"association protection\" in the tournament (for group stage, the only team from the same association they could be drawn with was Chelsea, as the rest were in the same seeding pot). The top 2 teams in each group advanced to the Champions League knock-out stage, while the third-placed teams advanced to the Round of 32 in the UEFA Cup.\nTiebreakers are applied in the following order:\nReal Betis, Villarreal, Udinese, Thun, and Artmedia made their debut appearance in the group stage.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds."

        "title": "Italy national cricket team",
        "text": "The Italy national cricket team is the men's team that represents the country of Italy in international cricket. They have been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1995, having previously been an affiliate member since 1984. The Italy national cricket team is administered by the Italian Cricket Federation.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest mention of cricket in Italy is of a match played by Admiral Nelson's sailors in Bayside, NY in 1793 during a stop in Naples harbour. Around the end of the 19th century, several combined cricket and association football clubs formed, including the world-famous A.C. Milan, which was originally the \"Milan Cricket and Football Club\" and the first Italian football team Genoa Cricket and Football Club, which was originally the \"Genoa Cricket &amp; Athletic Club\". But these clubs soon forgot about cricket and concentrated on football. Cricket started to be revived after the Second World War. Cricket flourished in Rome in the 1960s at a superb field which looked across to St. Peter's dome from Villa Doria Pamphili. The Australian and British embassies, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the Commonwealth War Graves Association, the Venerable English College and Beda College fielded teams which competed for the Rome Ashes there until, in the 1970s, the Villa became a public park.\nWhen cricket resumed in Rome on other grounds at the end of the 1970s, four of the Villa Doria Pamphili-era players formed in 1980 the Doria Pamphili Cricket Club: the Italian-Sri Lankan Francis Alphonsus Jayarajah, the Italian-Indian Massimo da Costa, the Australian Desmond O'Grady and the Syrian Issam Kahale\nIn the same period, some cricket was played in the northern part of Italy with the Milan Cricket Club being formed in the 1970s and Euratom CC in the 1980s.\nModern history.\nThe \"Federazione Cricket Italiana\" (Italian Cricket Federation) was formed in 1980, and they became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1984, and were promoted to associate member in 1995.\nThe first record match by the Italy national team was touring their first UK Tour in August 1984 and played a week of cricket against local London clubs, the first losing against Enfield CC, but ending on a high with their first win in the last match against North Middlesex.\nThe first international match played by the Italy national team was a draw against Denmark in 1989.\nAfter years of matches against neighboring nations such as France and Germany, in 1996, Italy took part in the first European Championship in Denmark, finishing seventh after beating Israel in a play-off. They took part in the ICC Trophy for the first time in the 1997 tournament and performed poorly, finishing joint last out of the 22 participants. They finished fifth in the following year's European Championship.\nIn 1999, Italy took part in a quadrangular tournament in Gibraltar also featuring France and Israel. They won the tournament, beating the hosts in the final. They finished fifth in Division One of the European Championship the following year and were due to participate in the 2001 ICC Trophy, but pulled out at the last minute due to a dispute over the eligibility of four players.\nThe 2002 European Championship saw Italy finish sixth in Division One, relegating them for 2004 to Division Two, which they promptly won. This qualified them for the repêchage tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They finished seventh in that tournament after beating Zambia in a play-off.\nThey took part in Division One of the European Championship in 2006, finishing fifth. In May–June 2007, they travelled to Darwin, Australia, to take part in Division Three of the World Cricket League. They finished seventh after beating Fiji in a play-off, and played in Division Four of the World Cricket League in 2008 to come third and remained in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four. With a second place finish there, they were promoted to 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 4th to remain in 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. They had a chance of reaching the 2015 Cricket World Cup, if they finished in the top two in the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, and then in the top two of the 2013 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. An encouraging start to this tournament witnessed wins over Oman (9 wickets) and United States (8 runs), followed by defeats, narrowly to Ireland (2 wickets) and more comprehensively against Kenya (7 wickets). After finishing last in this tournament they were relegated to Division Four in 2014.\nIn November 2013 they competed in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE, their highest level of competition to date. They finished 9th place with victories over the US, and higher-ranked opponents in UAE and Namibia.\n2018–present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Italy and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.\nIn September 2018, Italy qualified from Group B of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier to the Regional Finals of the tournament.\nItaly played their first T20I against Germany in May 2019.\nFrom August 2019, Italy will play in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nIn 2023, it was reported that Italy had pursued a strategy of recruiting professional cricketers from Australia and England to play in the regional final of the 2022–23 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier. The recruits have only tenuous connections with Italy but meet ICC regulations by virtue of holding Italian passports.\nSquad.\nItaly's squad for the 2023 ICC T20 World Cup Europe Regional Final in July 2023 included the following players:\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Italy\n\"Last updated 28 July 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Italy\nMost T20I wickets for Italy\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2178.

He saw increased playing time during the season as a result of a brawl between the Pacers and Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, that caused small forward Ron Artest to be suspended for the remainder of the season and shooting guard Stephen Jackson to be suspended 30 games. Jones was a DNP-CD in seven games. He scored a career-high 27 points on 10-of-14 shooting while going 6-of 9-from three-point range on November 28, 2004, against the Seattle SuperSonics.\nPhoenix Suns (2005–2007).\nJones was traded by the Pacers to the Phoenix Suns on August 25, 2005, in exchange for a 2008 second-round draft pick.

The Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference championship for the third year in a row, as Jones and teammate LeBron James joined Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Heinsohn, and Frank Ramsey (all from the Boston Celtics) as the only players in NBA history to reach seven consecutive NBA Finals. Facing the Golden State Warriors in the Finals for the third straight year, the Cavaliers lost the series in five games. Jones played in 48 games, starting 2, for the Cavaliers during the 2016–17 season while averaging 2.8 points, 0.8 rebounds and 7.9 minutes a game.\nJones' final NBA game ever was Game 4 of that 2017 Finals series against the Warriors on June 9, 2017 where Cleveland would win the game 137–116 with Jones playing only the last 2 minutes of the game and recording no stats.\nExecutive career.\nPhoenix Suns (2017–present).\nOn July 19, 2017, Jones was named the Director of Player Personnel for the Phoenix Suns, effectively ending his 14-year NBA career. On October 8, 2018, Jones was named an interim general manager for the Phoenix Suns alongside assistant general manager Trevor Bukstein after firing the previous general manager, Ryan McDonough. During the 2018–19 season, he orchestrated two trades for the Suns to acquire more veteran players to help improve the team's play: trading Trevor Ariza for Kelly Oubre Jr. in December 2018 and Ryan Anderson for Tyler Johnson in February 2019. On April 11, 2019, the Suns removed the interim tag from Jones' title, naming him the team's general manager, with Bukstein remaining as assistant general manager.\nDuring the 2019 off-season, Jones orchestrated changes that appeared questionable on the surface, such as firing head coach Igor Kokoškov after only one season (albeit hiring Monty Williams soon afterward), executing multiple trades in the 2019 NBA draft, including T. J. Warren to the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations, trading down from the 6th pick to pick up both Dario Šarić and the 11th draft pick (Cameron Johnson) from the Minnesota Timberwolves, and trading a late 2020 first round pick to the Boston Celtics for Aron Baynes and the 24th pick (Ty Jerome), and even picking up Ricky Rubio in free agency via trading multiple picks and players with the Memphis Grizzlies to free up more salary. Despite the mixed reception, Jones' moves would help the Suns achieve their best record in five seasons, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit U.S. shores in 2020, with a 26–39 record before the season was suspended. When the season resumed in the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Suns managed to finish with an 8–0 run in Orlando, with their only significant roster change adding G League guard Cameron Payne.\nWith the surprising improvement in the bubble, Jones orchestrated another major trade in November 2020, this time trading Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque, and a protected 2022 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Abdel Nader and All-Star point guard Chris Paul. Jones looked to bolster team depth in the delayed 2020 NBA draft period by selecting Jalen Smith at pick 10 and picking up Jae Crowder, E'Twaun Moore, Langston Galloway, and Damian Jones in the shortened 2020 free agency period in the hopes of ending their decade-long playoff drought. The Suns wound up making the 2021 NBA playoffs for the first time since 2010. Because of the Suns' dramatic improvement, Jones earned the 2020–21 NBA Executive of the Year Award. The Suns would reach the 2021 NBA Finals, but lost the series in 6 games to the Milwaukee Bucks.\nAfter the following season provided the franchise their best regular season record (which included signings of players like JaVale McGee and Bismack Biyombo to improve their center depth), Jones was promoted from general manager to President of Basketball Operations and general manager (through acting team governor Sam Garvin) on November 28, 2022.\nPersonal life.\nJones is a Christian. He and his wife Destiny have a son named James Dylan Jones and two daughters named Jadynn Alyssa Jones and Jodie Marissa Jones. Jones's nicknames include \"Champ\", \"J. J.\" and \"JHoops\" (pronounced Joops). The James Jones Legacy Foundation was founded in 2009. He is also a managing partner of the consulting firm Jones and Jones Strategic Consulting. Jones previously owned an urban redevelopment company called James Jones Ventures. He began hosting an annual basketball camp called JHoops Live in 2009. He also runs a camp called Crew 22 Training Camp. Jones appeared on the television show \"Kitchen Nightmares\" in 2010.\nJones's uncle, Ricky Gutiérrez, played in Major League Baseball. Jones's aunt, Lisa Jones played basketball at the University of Miami from 1988 to 1990. His cousin Mionsha Gay also played at the University of Miami. His aunt, Hope Jones, and his cousin, Shelnita Jackson, played basketball at Barry University. Jones's father Jay Lee played at Southern University while his uncle Mitchell Lee played at the University of Minnesota and his cousin Shawn Brailsford played at Marshall University.\nJones was previously the secretary-treasurer of the NBA Players Association (NBPA)."

        "text": "John Christopher Brown (August 15, 1961 – December 26, 2006) was an American third baseman in Major League Baseball during the 1980s, most notably with the San Francisco Giants.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Jackson, Mississippi, Brown was a graduate of Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, California, where he played high school baseball with Darryl Strawberry. The 1979 Crenshaw High Cougars baseball team was the subject of Michael Sokolove's \"The Ticket Out: Darryl Strawberry and the Boys of Crenshaw\".\nBrown was selected by the Giants in the second round (44th overall) during the 1979 amateur draft.\nProfessional baseball career.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nAfter a steady climb through the Giants minor league system, Brown made his major league debut for them in 1984 as a September call-up. In his first full season in 1985, Brown batted .261 with 16 home runs and 61 runs batted in (RBIs) for the last-place Giants, made the All-Rookie team, and finished fourth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting; Brown also led the NL in times being hit by pitch (11). In 1986, Brown batted .317 and made the NL All-Star team after hitting nearly .350 in the season's first half. The same season, he was involved in an infamous brawl.\nAt the end of 1986, he complained of shoulder soreness. That offseason, an examination by Dr. Frank Jobe in Los Angeles discovered that there was indeed a serious problem, and surgery was performed that winter. The following season, with Brown hitting a paltry .242 after 38 games, the Giants sent him packing on July 5 along with Keith Comstock, Mark Davis, and Mark Grant in a midseason trade to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Kevin Mitchell, Dave Dravecky, and Craig Lefferts.\nSan Diego Padres and Detroit Tigers.\nBrown's play declined further as the year progressed, and he ended the year with a .237 average; the Giants went on to win the NL West division, and the Padres finished in last place. After dropping to a .235 average in 1988 for San Diego, Brown was dealt to the Detroit Tigers and was out of baseball by 1989 at the age of 28. In his career, he batted .269 with 38 home runs, 184 RBIs, 164 runs, 410 hits and 21 stolen bases in 449 games.\nLife after baseball.\nAfter retirement, Brown lived in Houston, Texas, with his wife Lisa and their two children, Paris Brown and Gordon Pickett. In 2004, Brown worked in Iraq driving an 18-wheel truck delivering diesel fuel for Halliburton. He took fire on numerous occasions, including in a convoy that was attacked on April 9, 2004, in which six Halliburton drivers and one soldier were killed, and another driver was kidnapped and later released. By 2006, Brown had returned to the United States.\nBrown died at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston on December 26, 2006, nearly a month after he suffered burns in a fire at a vacant house he owned in Sugar Land, Texas. He was 45 years of age."

        "title": "East Africa cricket team",
        "text": "The East Africa cricket team was a multi-national cricket team representing the countries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. Their first game was against Rhodesia in 1951. East Africa appeared in the 1975 World Cup and the 1979, 1982 and 1986 ICC Trophies. In the last two of these Kenya was represented in its own right, so that East Africa was effectively a Ugandan, Tanzanian and Zambian team.\nEast Africa was an associate member of the ICC from 1966 to 1989, after which its place was taken by East and Central Africa.\nHistory.\nCricket in the area began following British colonisation in the late nineteenth century. Most games were played on an 'officials vs settlers' basis initially, with no inter-territorial games being played. After the influx of Indian labourers into Africa to build the region's railway network the popularity of cricket expanded and by the end of World War II was one of the most played sports in the area. Consequently, the East Africa Cricket Conference was founded in 1951 as the governing body for cricket in the region. It administered the inter-colonial matches between its initial three member countries of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika. Later that year a combined team of the East African countries hosted a tour by the Rhodesian cricket team. \nEast Africa's next recorded match was in 1956 against a visiting Pakistani XI. Under the captaincy of Denis Dawson (brother of South African test player Ossie Dawson) the East Africans were defeated in a 3-day match by 8 wickets. The next year in a match against the touring Sunder Cricket Club the East Africans were defeated by 9 wickets. In 1958 a South African team of non-European players toured the region and played one match against East Africa in Nairobi. This time captained by Malcolm Ronaldson, a former first-class player for Eastern Province, East Africa was beaten in the three day match by the South African Non-Europeans by 7 wickets.\nEast Africa played several touring teams in the 1960s. In 1962 they played two games against the Commonwealth XI cricket team. In the first in Nairobi (10 to 12 February 1962) the East Africans were beaten by 20 runs. The match was best remembered by a fast paced unbeaten century by Basil D'Oliviera in the Commonwealth team's second innings. In the second match in October, also in Nairobi, the Commonwealth team beat East Africa by 118 runs. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured in 1963/4 playing three games in Uganda, one in Tanganyika and seven in Kenya. One of the games was against the East African team in Kampala where the MCC won by an innings and 71 runs. In August 1967 India toured and played one 3-day first-class match. India won by 8 wickets. An International XI of English first-class players visited in 1968 and played a 3-day match against East Africa in Nairobi. The match was drawn.\nEast Africa toured England in June and July 1972, playing 18 matches against domestic teams, including a six-wicket victory against North Wales. None of the matches had first-class status. The MCC toured East Africa again in 1973/74. In December 1973 they played two matches in Zambia followed by two more in Tanzania then four in Kenya. Their one match against the full East African team, which had first-class status, resulted in a 237-run victory for the MCC. \nEast Africa were invited to participate in the inaugural Cricket World Cup in 1975. Before the tournament began the teams participation was in doubt after Tanzania threatened to withhold players from touring England in protest of the British &amp; Irish Lions rugby team touring Apartheid South Africa in 1974. The inclusion of East Africa was seen as an important feature of the world cup due to a team from Africa being seen as necessary to signify the tournament as truly worldwide. The two strongest cricketing nations in Africa, South Africa and Rhodesia, selected players based on race and were excluded as part of a sporting boycott resulting in East Africa representing the continent. There were three notable omissions from the East African squad when it was announced, Basher Hassan, Dudley Owen-Thomas and John Solanky. All three were first-class cricketers playing county cricket in England but were born in East Africa (Solanky's first-class debut was for East Africa against the MCC in 1963/64 before emigrating to the UK). The selectors made a point of picking a squad that was currently living and playing in East Africa. The team played several warm up games against Somerset, Wales and Glamorgan. Their only victory was a three wicket win over Glamorgan on 5 June 1975, two days before their first match of the world cup. The team struggled and lost all three of their matches against New Zealand, India and England.\nIn 1978 the Minor Counties Cricket Association toured Kenya with seven matches there, two of which were against East Africa. The first was a 60 over match where the Minor Counties won by 8 wickets. A scheduled 3-day match was abandoned without any play.\nKenya broke away from the East Africa team in 1981 to join the ICC as an associate member in their own right. In 1989, East Africa was reconfigured as East and Central Africa (representing Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Malawi)."

        "title": "George Hall (baseball)",
        "text": "George William Hall (March 29, 1849 – June 11, 1923) was a professional baseball player who played in the National Association and later the National League. Born in Stepney, England, Hall later immigrated to the U.S. He made his professional debut on May 5, 1871. While playing for the Louisville Grays, he was banned from Major League Baseball after an 1877 gambling scandal.\nEarly career.\nPrior to the inception of professional leagues, Hall played for the Brooklyn Atlantics. He commenced his professional career with the Washington Olympics of the National Association in , hitting .294 in 32 games. He played for the Baltimore Canaries in and seasons, hitting .336 and .345 respectively. Playing mostly center field up to this point, he shifted from center to right field the following year when he played for the champions, the Boston Red Stockings. After just one season with the Red Stockings, he moved on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics, where he had another good season at the plate, hitting .299, with four home runs, which placed second in the league behind Jim O'Rourke's six.\nNational League.\nAfter the 1875 season, the National Association folded, which left room for a new league to begin. In , the National League came into existence, the first official \"Major League\". Hall's team, the Athletics, followed that movement with very little success, finishing seventh out of eight teams. One of the bright spots that year for the Athletics was the hitting prowess of their star hitter, Hall. He led the team in almost all major hitting categories including a .366 batting average, 51 runs scored, and a league leading five home runs. On June 17, 1876, he became the first Major League baseball player to hit two home runs in one game. Those five home runs stood as the single season home run record until Charley Jones hit nine in .\nFor the baseball season, Philadelphia had been expelled from the league for refusing to go on a western road trip, late in the 1876 season, for financial reasons, so Hall moved on to play for the Louisville Grays. Again, he had an excellent season, hitting .323, scoring 51 runs, and hitting 8 triples. Surprisingly, after appearing in the league leaders for home runs the last two seasons, he did not hit one in 1877.\nPossible first cycle.\nSome baseball researchers attribute Hall as being the first major league player to hit for the cycle. In a game against the Cincinnati Red Stockings on June 14, 1876, Hall had five hits. Contemporary newspaper accounts agree that four of the hits were a home run, a single, and two triples; there is disagreement as to if the remaining hit was a double (which would complete the cycle) or another triple. The first undisputed major league cycle is attributed to Curry Foley of the Buffalo Bisons of the National League in 1882.\nGambling scandal and banishment.\nOn October 26, 1877, Louisville club vice president Charles Chase confronted Hall and fellow Gray Jim Devlin with charges that they threw some road games in August and September. Both admitted only to throwing non-league games, one of which was an exhibition game in Lowell, Massachusetts, on August 30, and another in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 3. The admissions also implicated teammates Al Nichols and Bill Craver. Newspapers nicknamed Hall \"Gentleman George\". Hall claimed that he and Devlin helped in losses to the Cincinnati Reds on September 6 and to the minor league Indianapolis Blues on September 24‚ but he argued that since the Reds were about to be suspended and the games nullified‚ it amounted to an exhibition game. As a result of the scandal, all four players were banned for life from Major League Baseball.\nHall died in Ridgewood, New York, at the age of 74. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Kenny Washington (American football)",
        "text": "Kenneth Stanley Washington (August 31, 1918 – June 24, 1971) was an American professional football player who was the first African-American to sign a contract with a National Football League (NFL) team in the modern (post-World War II) era. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins.\nEarly life.\nKenneth Stanley Washington was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the city's Lincoln Heights neighborhood. His parents, Marian Lenàn and Negro league baseball player Edgar \"Blue\" Washington, separated when he was two years old. Kenny Washington was raised by his grandmother Susie Washington, his uncle Rocky, the first black uniformed lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), and his aunt-in-law Hazel. Washington was a star in both baseball and football at Abraham Lincoln High School, where he was nicknamed \"Kingfish\" after a character in the radio show \"Amos 'n' Andy\". He led both teams to city championships in the same calendar year.\nCollege career.\nWashington attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a member of both the Bruins' baseball and football teams. As a baseball player, Washington was rated better than his teammate Jackie Robinson. One story has it that Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher wanted to offer Washington a contract to play for the team, but only if he went to Puerto Rico first, which Washington refused to do.\nIn football, his position was tailback, and he often passed as much as he rushed. Washington rushed for 1,914 yards in his college career, a school record for 34 years. He was one of four African American players on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team, the others being Woody Strode, Robinson, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the four backfield players that year. This was a rarity to have so many African Americans when only a few dozen at all played on college football teams. The Bruins played eventual conference and national champion USC to a 0–0 tie with the 1940 Rose Bowl on the line. It was the first UCLA–USC rivalry football game with national implications. UCLA teammates have commented how strong Washington was when confronted with racial slurs and discrimination.\nWashington was the first Bruin to lead the nation in total offense and became the first consensus All-American in the history of the school's football program in 1939. Despite these achievements and the fact that he also doubled as a defensive back, he was named to second-team All-America selection instead of the first and was omitted from the East–West Shrine Game that year. These slights were the source of much outrage among media outlets which blamed them on racial discrimination.\nAccording to \"Time\" magazine's coverage of the 1940 College All-Star Game, Washington was \"considered by West Coast fans the most brilliant player in the US last year.\" He starred in the 1940 film \"While Thousands Cheer\".\nProfessional football.\nAfter graduation, George Halas, who coached the College All-Star Game, indicated interest in Washington for his Chicago Bears team, but was unable to convince the league to permit integration. Instead, Washington coached football at UCLA and joined the LAPD. From 1940 to 1945, Washington played for the Hollywood Bears of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League, where he was the league's highest-paid player. He earned all-league recognition each year, including his first year when he suffered a knee injury that prevented him from being conscripted for the war. Ezzrett Anderson and Washington's UCLA teammate Strode were also on that team. In 1945, he did serve in the military on the USO tour as a type of sports ambassador, visiting with troops and playing in exhibition games.\nWhen the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles, the team sought to play in the publicly owned Los Angeles Memorial Coliseuma decision which created immediate pressure that the team be racially integrated, since black taxpayers as well as white had paid for construction of the facility. The terms of the Coliseum’s lease would end up being a determining factor in signing of Washington and the re-integration of the NFL. The Rams backfield coach Bill Snyder would later state that “I doubt we would have been interested in Washington had we stayed in Cleveland.” \nThe \"Los Angeles Tribune\" was especially outspoken in its push for the Rams to sign Washington, thanks to its African-American sports editor, William Claire \"Halley\" Harding, a former professional athlete and member of the debate team at Wiley College. As a result, the team signed Washington on 1946, followed by Strode on . Following Washington's signing, parallels were drawn to Jackie Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers by some in the media.\nWhile the signings of Washington and Strode are notable as they marked the re-entry of African-Americans into the NFL, both of these players had already passed their athletic peaks (Strode was 31). At age 27, prior to his first NFL season Washington underwent surgery in both knees (his fifth knee surgery overallas a child he contracted rickets and was once hit by car), having torn cartilage removed from his left knee and what was characterized in the press as \"a growth\" from his right. Washington would play for the Rams for three seasons despite his injuries, producing a productive tenure with the team. Washington was the league leader in yards per carry in his second season, and even scored a 92-yard touchdown, which remains the Rams team record for the longest run from scrimmage. While his career in the NFL did not reach the statistical heights of his college career, his entry into the league is still of great importance due to the precedent it set of allowing African Americans into the modern NFL. When he retired in 1948, 80,000 people attended his final game and the entire stadium gave him a standing ovation.\nLater years.\nWashington was a Republican in his younger years and strongly supported Richard Nixon's 1950 U.S. Senate campaign. The night before Nixon's victory over Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, the candidatea great football fanspent the evening at Washington's south Los Angeles home playing music and trying to relax. However, in the 1960 presidential election, Washington voted for John F. Kennedy instead of Nixon and tended to vote for Democrats for the rest of his life, but he never declared a political party affiliation.\nAfter retirement from football, Washington returned to the LAPD. He also worked for a grocery store chain and a whiskey distributor, and was a part-time scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, where his son Kenny Jr. played. Thanks to his connections from when he had worked at movie studios during his undergraduate years, he was also chosen for a few film roles, including \"Rope of Sand\" (1949), \"Pinky\" (1949), and \"The Jackie Robinson Story\" (1950).\nDeath.\nWashington died of heart and lung problems at the age of 52 in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery.\nLegacy.\nFor his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, Washington was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \"Court of Honor\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956 and his number 13 jersey was the first to be retired at UCLA. He was posthumously inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame. His \"alma mater\" Abraham Lincoln High School has annually awarded the Kenny Washington Trophy to the school's best football player since 1949.\nOne legacy of Washington's and Strode's experience in the NFL – paralleled in 1946 by racial trailblazers Marion Motley and Bill Willis in the rival All-America Football Conference – was that Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, saw that blacks and whites could coexist in a violent sport without much disruption, and decided that Major League Baseball could be integrated as well. He signed Washington's and Strode's UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers in 1947.\nHowever, for many years, Washington was ignored by the NFL and the story of professional football's postwar integration received little attention. One reason is because for most of the 20th century, baseball was by far the top sport in the U.S., and another was that his NFL career was a short three years. Neither Washington nor Strode has been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although both Marion Motley and Bill Willis of the AAFC's and NFL's Cleveland Browns have received that honor. Lincoln High School renamed their stadium after Washington, and every year since 2011 holds a memorial football game on the anniversary of Washington's death."

He reached the major league club in 1980. Traded to the Braves on June 30, 1982, he enjoyed his winningest seasons while with that organization, going 15–8 and 14–8 in 1983 and 1984 respectively. His most successful seasons were spent with the Montreal Expos, where he went 28-21 with a 2.80 ERA between 1987 and 1989.\nSlender at , , he received extensive press coverage for both on-field and off-field controversies. He was arrested for cocaine possession in his native Dominican Republic in January 1984 and spent three months in prison although his ultimate sentence was only a fine of $1,000. He did not rejoin the Braves until May 1984. He often drew the ire of his opponents, using an imaginary finger gun to shoot opponents and would pound the baseball into the ground. While it is customary for pitchers to walk back to the bench after completing an inning, he would run full speed to the dugout (gold chains and long, curly locks bouncing) after an inning-ending strikeout. He eventually added the \"Pascual pitch\" (his version of the \"eephus\") to his repertoire. He was also involved in more than one beanball incident, most notably an August 12, 1984 brawl with the San Diego Padres where he hit the Padres' Alan Wiggins with his first pitch leading off the game, inciting each San Diego pitcher in the game to throw at him each time he came to bat. He had just received his driver's license and earned the nicknames \"Perimeter Pascual\" and \"Wrong-Way Perez\" after missing a start on August 19, 1982, while circling Atlanta's Interstate 285 (a beltway) three times looking for Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, he ran out of gas and arrived at the ballpark 10 minutes late.\nReleased by the Braves on April 1, 1986, he missed the entire 1986 season. After signing a minor league contract with the Expos in 1987, he joined them in August and finished the 1987 season 7–0 with an outstanding 2.30 ERA. His last winning season came the following year when he went 12–8 and posted a 2.44 ERA with the Expos.\nPérez threw a five-inning rain-shortened no-hitter against the Phillies on September 24, 1988. It was the first no-hitter in Veterans Stadium history. Pérez allowed one walk, and another Phillies baserunner reached on an error. Umpire Harry Wendelstedt waved off the game after a 90-minute rain delay after the game was stopped by rain with one out in the top of the sixth. However, due to a statistical rule change in 1991, no-hitters must last at least nine innings to count. As a result of the retroactive application of the new rule, this game and thirty-five others are no longer considered no-hitters.\nHe was granted free agency in November 1989 and signed with the Yankees. Through 1990 and 1991, he started only 17 games for the Yankees and compiled records of 1–2 and 2–4 respectively. Prior to the 1992 season, he was suspended by Major League Baseball for one year for violating the league's drug policy, a suspension that ended his career. His career record was 67–68.\nTwo of his brothers, Mélido and Carlos, were also major league pitchers, as was a cousin, Yorkis.\nHe also was married for 16 years to Maritza Madera Gross and had two daughters, Mariel Gross and Roxanna Gross.\nPascual first made his trademark peek through the legs to check the runner on first in 1979 in the Dominican League.\nDeath.\nPérez was found dead in his bedroom in San Gregorio de Nigua, Dominican Republic, on November 1, 2012, after being hit on the head repeatedly with a hammer in an apparent robbery. He was also stabbed in the neck."

        "title": "Kōshien baseball tournament",
        "text": "In Japan, Kōshien (甲子園) generally refers to the two annual baseball tournaments played by high schools nationwide culminating at a final showdown at Hanshin Kōshien Stadium in Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan. They are organized by the Japan High School Baseball Federation in association with Mainichi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring (also known as \"Spring Kōshien\") and Asahi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Championship in the summer (also known as \"Summer Kōshien\").\nBoth of these nationwide tournaments enjoy widespread popularity similar to that of NCAA March Madness in the United States, arguably equal to or greater than professional baseball. Summer qualifying tournaments are televised locally and each game of the Spring and Summer tournaments at Kōshien are televised nationally on NHK alongside the TV channels associated with the newspapers organizing the tournaments. The tournaments have gone on to become national traditions, and large numbers of frenzied students and parents travel from their hometowns to cheer for their local team. It is common to see players walking off the field in tears after being eliminated from the tournament by a loss, especially during the Summer Tournament, since it symbolizes the third-year players' retirement from high school baseball.\nThe star players of the championship team achieve a degree of celebrity status. For players, playing at Kōshien becomes a gateway to playing at the professional level. Due to the recruiting practices of Japanese high schools, top prospects often play on strong teams that were able to reach the final tournament at Kōshien. Many professional baseball players first made their mark at Kōshien, including Eiji Bandō, Sadaharu Oh, Koji Ota, Suguru Egawa, Masumi Kuwata, Kazuhiro Kiyohara, Hideki Matsui, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, Masahiro Tanaka, Yusei Kikuchi, and Shohei Ohtani.\nBackground.\nThere are two main tournaments:\nIn addition, there is a separate and less well-known Meiji Jingu Baseball Tournament held each year in November at Jingu Baseball Stadium in Tokyo. Beginning with the 2002 tournament, the region of the winning school receives one extra bid in the following Spring tournament at Kōshien; this bid is typically given to the winning school as a matter of respect. \nParticulars.\nIn the week preceding the tournament in spring and summer, teams who have won a spot in the tournament each hold a 30-minute practice on the grounds of Hanshin Kōshien Stadium. This is mainly to help the players adjust to the environment of the stadium. In the summer, due to scheduling conflicts with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball, the Tigers are forced to host their home games at Osaka Dome (in the distant past, the Tigers used to make a road trip every year during this period to allow the tournament to take place). This period was also called (\"shi no ro-do\", lit. \"the Road Trip of Death\") due the difficulties the team had to endure.\nIn addition, teams are able to practice during the tournament at public and private facilities made available in Nishinomiya, and neighboring Osaka, Amagasaki, and Kobe.\nUsually, first-year students are not selected to take part in Spring Kōshien, so in their three years of high school, players have five chances to go to Kōshien.\nNotable events and accomplishments.\nSpring-Summer champions.\nKnown in Japanese as 春夏連続優勝 (\"haru-natsu renzoku yuusho\") or Spring-Summer champions, this signifies the winning of both the \"senbatsu\" (Spring) and \"senshuken\" (Summer) tournaments in a calendar year. To date, this has been accomplished eight times:\nParticipation of overseas teams.\nBefore World War II, teams from Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria, which were all part of the Japanese Empire at the time, participated in the tournaments (in the spring only Taiwan took part). The first overseas teams to participate were Pusan Commercial School of Korea and Dalian Commercial School of Manchuria in the 1921 Summer Kōshien. Foreign teams have made it as far as the championship game, but have never won the tournament. The last tournament including foreign teams was the 1940 Spring Kōshien.\nSix-time Kōshien participants.\nCurrently, the maximum number of times a player can appear in Kōshien is five. However, under the former secondary school system, a player could appear more than five times. Here are two examples.\nMakeshift Kōshien.\nThe tournament was suspended due to the war from summer 1941 until spring 1946, with the exception of a \"Promote the Fighting Spirit\" tournament held by the Ministry of Education in 1942 at Kōshien. The number of teams was only 16 compared with 23 at the previous tournament, but each region held qualifying tournaments and sent teams to the national tournament. The military theme was prevalent at the tournament, with military slogans posted on the scoreboard, and traditional Japanese kanji characters replacing trendy English letters on the players' uniforms. The tournament proceeded smoothly and Tokushima Commercial (Tokushima) won the championship. However, since this tournament differed from past Summer Kōshiens hosted by Asahi Shimbun, it is not counted as an official Kōshien tournament.\nSacred \"Dirt of Kōshien\".\nIn the 1937 Summer Kōshien, Kumamoto Tech (Kumamoto) advanced to the championship game, but lost. After the game, Kumamoto Tech player Tetsuharu Kawakami grabbed a handful of dirt from the playing field of Kōshien Stadium and put it in his uniform pocket as a memento. Some years later, in the 1949 Summer Kōshien, after Kokura High (Fukuoka) lost to Kurashiki Tech (Okayama) in the semifinals, Kokura pitcher Kunio Fukushima scooped up some Kōshien dirt and took it home. This has become known as the original scooping of . Since then, as a memento of their fleeting time on the hallowed grounds of Kōshien, players from the losing teams take home a pouch of the precious soil.\nAt the 1958 Summer Kōshien, Shuri High (Okinawa) became the first school to represent Okinawa (then under U.S. government rule) in a Kōshien tournament. They were eliminated in their first game by Tsuruga High (Fukui). After the game, they collected souvenirs of dirt and took them home. However, due to health regulations of the Ryūkyū government they were not allowed to keep the dirt, and it was confiscated. Some Japan Airlines flight attendants heard about this, and had a sea stone lying outside Kōshien Stadium sent to Shuri. Even today this \"Monument of Friendship\" lies in the yard of the school as a reminder of the first trip to Kōshien by a team from Okinawa.\nDisqualifications.\nIn the past, if a scandal was uncovered at a high school chosen to participate in the Kōshien, the school was forced to withdraw from competition in the tournament. A team's participation in the tournament was affected even by scandals not related to team members. However, recently, such unrelated incidents have had less effect on a team's participation.\nDisqualifications from Kōshien based on circumstances other than scandals have also occurred. In the 1922 summer tournament, Niigata Commercial High School's disqualification was based on a star player's illness.\nTerminology for champions from different regions.\nThe Shirakawa Barrier and the Tsugaru Strait.\nFor the first eight-plus decades of the Kōshien tournament, no team north of the Kantō region won a championship. This phenomenon became known in the high school baseball world as the Shirakawa Barrier after the actual fortification by that name, which was built near the border between the Kantō and Tōhoku regions in Shirakawa, Fukushima during the Nara Period (710–794).\nAt the 2004 Summer Kōshien, South Hokkaidō representative Komazawa University Tomakomai High (Komadai Tomakomai) took the title, and in one bound leaped over not only the Shirakawa Barrier but also the Tsugaru Strait separating Hokkaidō from Honshū. On the plane carrying the team and championship flag back home, at the moment the plane crossed the Tsugaru Strait, the passengers joined in unison for a celebration cheer.\nDespite Komadai Tomakomai becoming the northernmost team to win a Kōshien championship, the championship flag did not actually pass through the Shirakawa Barrier on land, leading many fans (especially in the Tōhoku region) to consider the barrier unbroken. It was finally broken in 2022, when Sendai Ikuei (Miyagi) beat Shimonoseki Kokusai (Yamaguchi) to become the first Tōhoku school to win a Kōshien championship.\nIn 2005, Komadai Tomakomai won a second straight Summer Kōshien title, becoming the first to do so since Kokura Secondary (Fukuoka) in 1947–48. This title was tainted after the tournament, however, by reports of repeated incidents of physical punishment of one of the players, including once during the tournament, by the baseball club advisor (a 27-year-old school faculty member). Besides a reprimand for withholding the report until after the tournament, the High School Baseball Federation did not punish Komazawa Tomakomai. However, the report drew widespread attention to the issue of physical punishment in youth sports in Japan. It is believed that such physical punishment probably goes heavily underreported, due to cultural tendencies.\nPassing Hakone and Fording the Tone River.\nIn the early days of the Kōshien tournament, western Japanese teams won the majority of the tournaments and were thus seen as stronger than eastern teams. The metaphorical barrier keeping the championship flags in western Japan was Hakone, which, like Shirakawa, was a strategic checkpoint during the Edo period (1603–1868) requiring official passes to pass through.\nTechnically, the first \"passing of Hakone\" occurred when Keio Futsūbu (Tōkyō) won in the summer of 1916, the second Summer Kōshien. However, the tournament and high school baseball itself were far from the eventual heights of their popularity at the time, and 33 years passed before a Kantō team won another championship; that victory by Shōnan High (Kanagawa) in the summer of 1949 is regarded as the first passing of Hakone.\nThe first passing of Hakone in the spring was achieved in 1957 by Waseda Jitsugyō (Tōkyō), which was led by pitcher and future pro baseball legend Sadaharu Oh.\nThe championship flags made their way farther north into Kantō in 1962, when Sakushin Gakuin (Tochigi) became the first school to win both the Spring and Summer tournaments in one calendar year. To reach Tochigi, the flag had to \"ford the Tone River,\" a major waterway that roughly divides the region into northern and southern halves.\nSince then, Kantō teams have won championships more frequently, and as a result, these terms have fallen out of use.\nCrossing the Kanmon Straits.\nRefers to a championship by a team from Kyūshū. The first team to \"cross the Kanmon Straits\" between Honshū and Kyūshū was Kokura Secondary in the 1947 Summer Kōshien. Coincidentally, Kokura Secondary repeated as champions in 1948, a feat not matched until Komadai Tomakomai did it in 2004 and 2005, also becoming the first team to bring the title to their region.\nPassing Mount Aso.\nWhen a team from the southern half of Kyūshū wins a tournament, the championship flag must pass Mount Aso in Kumamoto. The first team to \"pass Mount Aso\" was Seiseikō High (Kumamoto) in the 1958 Spring Kōshien. This has not yet been achieved in the Summer Kōshien.\nCrossing the ocean.\nWhen a team from Okinawa wins a tournament. The first to \"cross the ocean\" was Okinawa Shōgaku (Okinawa) in the spring of 1999. The first summer crossing occurred when Kōnan (Okinawa) won the 2010 Summer Kōshien.\nInto snow country.\nWhen a team from the Hokuriku region wins a tournament. To date, no team has achieved this. Fukui Commercial High (Fukui) in the 1978 Spring Kōshien and Seiryō (Ishikawa, alma mater of Hideki Matsui) in the 1997 Summer Kōshien reached the semifinals. More recently, Nihon Bunri (Niigata, Niigata) reached the finals in 2009, and made an amazing comeback—down to their final strike with nobody on base in a 10–4 ballgame, they mounted a five-run rally and put the winning run on first base before finally succumbing, 10–9. Seiryō reached the finals in 2019, ultimately losing 5–3 to Riseisha (Osaka).\nAppearances in popular culture.\nSome of the most famous appearances of high school baseball in popular culture are in the manga and anime series \"Touch\", \"H2\" and \"Cross Game\" by Mitsuru Adachi, \"Ace of Diamond\" by Yuji Terajima, and \"Major\" by Takuya Mitsuda. Those series follow the struggles of different high school teams' bids to make it to the Kōshien tournament.\nAn unusual appearance is in the series \"Princess Nine\", where a private girls' high school forms a baseball team and struggles against systemic bias in the Japan High School Baseball Federation and within their own school in order to make a serious bid at making it to and winning at Kōshien. More recently, the Manga work \"Karin´s Mound\" (花鈴のマウンド Karin no maundo) also entertained the idea that the Girl's National High School Championship would be also played at Kōshien Stadium, which has happened in the real world since 2021. In the long running baseball video game series \"Pawapuro Series\", it is known that at least three female players (two pitchers and one catcher, until 14) made their name in Kōshien in the main series' original story line (Success Mode) and turned active players in the NPB, through one of them retired later and become a coach and lecturer in Baseball academy.\nThe manga and anime Big Windup! by Asa Higuchi is about high school baseball. It follows the story of a first-year pitcher and his team's struggles to get to Kōshien. It won the Kodansha Manga Award in 2007.\nIn the finale of the anime \"Zipang\", radio broadcast of the \"patriotic\" 1942 summer tournament is playing in the background when Kadomatsu meets his grandfather back in the past.\nIn the \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" supernatural action manga, after an exchange event between two jujutsu schools is interrupted by enemies, a decision is made to finish it with an impromptu friendly baseball tournament, which takes place in a chapter titled \"Jujutsu Koshien\". This title was also preserved for the associated episode of the anime adaptation."

He played as a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball between 1995 and 2004.\nBorn in Alabama, he played high school baseball in Pickens County, Alabama with Terry Pearson. He played college baseball at Auburn University for the Auburn Tigers.\nFrom 1996–2003, Sullivan was one of the Cincinnati Reds's most durable relief pitchers, and was looked upon as a clubhouse leader. He set a club record by pitching at least 100 innings of relief every season from 1998-2001. His best season came in 1999, a year in which the Reds won 96 games but did not make the postseason after losing a one-game playoff to the New York Mets. That season, Sullivan set or tied career highs in saves (3), appearances (79), innings pitched (113.2) and ERA (3.01).\nSullivan used a unique sidearm delivery when pitching. Like many \"submarine pitchers\" (as they're sometimes called), he developed back problems, which resulted in multiple trips to the disabled list toward the end of his career.

        "text": "The 1966 Tour de France was the 53rd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 21 June and 14 July, with 22 stages covering a distance of .\nLucien Aimar was a domestique of 5-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil. Aimar joined a breakaway in the middle of the tour and ended up on the leader board. Anquetil then began helping Aimar win the Tour, to make sure and deny it to his then-enemy Raymond Poulidor. After stage 18 Aimar's victory was certain barring disaster. Anquetil rode hard that day to ensure it and then quit the race.\nThe points classification was won by Willy Planckaert, and the mountains classification by Julio Jiménez. The team classification was won by .\nDuring the Tour, word spread that there was going to be a dope test, and all the riders but Raymond Poulidor, the darling of French cycling fans, left their hotels. The other riders staged a strike in protest during stage nine dismounting and walking their bicycles. Eventually they started riding again, but only after arguing with officials.\nTeams.\nAs in the years before, the 1966 Tour de France was run with trade teams; each trade team consisted of 10 cyclists, and at least six of them needed to have the same nationality.\nInitially, there would be only two Belgian teams, but one month before the Tour it was decided that three Belgian teams would be fielded, with the Smiths team being the late addition. Shortly after this, a medical test showed Felice Gimondi, winner of the 1965 Tour de France, could not defend his title because he was physically not fit; his team then decided not to start at all, so the number of teams was back to thirteen.\nThe organisers then invited the Italian team (headed by Italo Zilioli and Franco Balmamion) to replace Salvarani, but at the last moment they refused. Thirteen teams started, for a total of 130 cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1966 Tour de France started on 21 June, and had two rest days, in Luchon and Turin. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nRudi Altig won the first stage with a small advantage. In the next stages, no big time differences were made, so Altig was able to defend his lead until the mountains.\nThe first mountains were in the tenth stage. A group including Lucien Aimar and Jan Janssen gained time on pre-race favourites Jacques Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor, and Tommaso de Pra won the race and became the new leader. The next stage, Lebaube became the leader, and Kunde took over in the twelfth stage.\nIn the time trial in the fourteenth stage, Anquetil was defeated by Poulidor. Kunde remained the leader, with Janssen in second place. In the sixteenth stage, Julio Jiménez escaped in the Pyrenées, and he was followed by a group including Janssen, Anquetil and Poulidor, but without Kunde. Jiménez stayed away, but Janssen became the new leader.\nEven though the seventeenth stage included two mountain climbs, it was not considered too difficult, because these climbs were located in the first half of the stage. The cyclists made the climbs in one large group, but in the descent, a large group escaped. They were chased by teammates Anquetil and Aimar, and when most of the escapees were caught, Aimar continued on his own, and surprised Janssen by this. Janssen lost time on Aimar, and Aimar became the new leader.\nIn the eighteenth stage, Janssen wanted to attack, but Aimar and Anquetil stayed close to him. Poulidor, sixth in the general classification, managed to escape, but Anquetil led the chase on him. The next day, Anquetil left the race, sick and no longer able to win himself.\nJanssen managed to win back some time on Aimar in the final time trial, but it was not enough, and Aimar became the winner of the Tour. Janssen became the first Dutch cyclist to reach the podium in the general classification in the Tour de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1966 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points led the classification and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave \"stars\". The cyclist with the most \"stars\" in all stages lead the \"star classification\". Rudi Altig won this classification. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 16. This prize was won by Julio Jiménez."
