        "title": "NCAA basketball championships (Philippines)",
        "text": "The NCAA basketball championships are the basketball championships of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) (NCAA). There are two tournaments, usually held at the same time, the seniors' tournament for male collegiate students, and the juniors' tournament for male senior high school students. If a school wins both championships in one season, it said that they have won the \"double championship.\"\nThe tournament commences with a double-round robin of eliminations, where the four teams with the best records advance to the semifinals, with the two top seeds clinching the twice-to-beat advantage. The winners in the semifinals meet in a best-of-3 finals series, in order to determine the champion.\nThe championship is continually contested since the NCAA's foundation in 1924, except during World War II, during the mid-1960s when scandals rocked the association, in 1980 when the tournament was aborted by the Basketball Association of the Philippines, and from 2020 to 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe athletic nicknames of the different teams variously came from the school's founders, or from a distinct quality that separated a school from the others.\nNotably, the first champion of this event was crowned in 1925, 14 years before the U.S. NCAA tournament was instituted.\nTournament format.\nSince 1997, all member schools have fielded their varsity teams in a double round elimination tournament, where the schools play each other twice. The four teams with the best records advance to the crossover semifinals, popularly known as the Final Four.\nThe two top teams have a twice to beat advantage. The lower ranked teams need to win twice against the higher ranked teams to advance to the best-of-three finals, where the first team to reach two wins becomes the NCAA basketball champion.\nGroup stage sweep.\nIf any event a team finishes the group stage undefeated, that team will advance outright to the finals. The third and fourth seeds will have a sudden-death game to determine the opponent of the second seed. Then, the winner of the sudden-death match between the second seed and third/fourth seed advances to the finals to face the first seed. Previously, the first seed holds a twice to beat advantage in the finals (the finals would not be a best of three affair), until 2008, the finals was in a best-of-three series even if a team swept the group stage. Since 2010 the team who sweeps the group stage will automatically go to the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage and a 1-0 edge over their opponent, their opponent needs to beat them thrice while the team who sweeps the 2-round elimination will just have to beat their opponents twice.\nPrevious formats.\nPrior to 1997, when the NCAA had, for most part of its history, six teams, it employed a split season format. The winner of the first round (the team with the highest standing) would notch the first Final berth, while the winner of the second round would notch the second Final berth.\nIf a team manages to have the best overall record, yet fails to win either round, that team will play the winner of the second round in a playoff game, to face the winner of the first round in the Championship game. The games of the Championship round are all single-elimination matches, until the 1980s when the Championship game was expanded to a best-of-three series.\nIf a team manages to win both rounds (not necessarily a sweep), the Championship round will be omitted, and that team will be declared outright champions.\nIn cases of tie, a playoff game will be played to determine which team won the round. If more than two teams are tied, each team will play the teams they are tied with once. If for example, a team won the first round, and is tied with another team for first place at the second round, a playoff game will be played to determine which team wins the round. If the team that won the first round wins in the playoff game, the Championship round will be omitted, since the team won both rounds. If the other team wins, a Championship round will held, since two different teams won the two rounds.\nThe 2021 tournament, held in early 2022, was in a special format used only for that season. There was only one round of eliminations, and a play-in tournament was held for teams that finished third to sixth; after that, the regular Final Four format was used.\nHistory.\nSome of the Letran team players were products of their Varsity High School Team namely: Ted McKinney, Ramon San Juan, William Alberto and were also part of the 1976 National Inter-Secondary Champion Team that was held in Baguio City wherein they beat their NCAA rival San Beda College with the score of 52-51\nIt was a double victory for the Muralla-based cagers as they dominated in winning the Jrs and Srs NCAA Basketball Championship that year. They were also declared the General Champion by the NCAA Management for winning most of the events that the NCAA has provided. It was very sweet for the Knights for getting that award as it was their first time dominating all events.\nNCAA basketball champions.\nBasketball, as the most popular sport in the Philippines, receives the most attention from the press and the sports-minded public. As a result, the NCAA Seniors Basketball championship is the most coveted title among the NCAA events.\nSan Beda has the most Seniors basketball title a record 22 times, followed by Colegio de San Juan de Letran with 20 and the Ateneo de Manila (now with the University Athletic Association of the Philippines) is third with 14.\nThere is a separate division for high school student-athletes, the Juniors division. San Beda High School has the most titles with 23 while the Malayan High School of Science (formerly Mapúa High School) won 22.\nSan Beda University leads the overall tally with 45 basketball titles, followed by Letran with 33. Among defunct members, Ateneo has the most championships, with 23.\nThe current champions are the San Beda University Red Lions (seniors), and the Letran Squires (juniors).\nDouble Championships.\nWhen a school wins both the Juniors (or Midgets pre-1925) and Seniors tournament at the same season, the school is said to have won the double championship.\nAs of 2023, only seven schools were able to win the double championship:\nAteneo de Manila University, San Beda College and San Sebastian College-Recoletos have the most double championships with six apiece. San Beda College also has the most consecutive double championships with five.\nAwards.\nBeginning in NCAA Season 98, the men's tournament was held from October to December, then the juniors' tournament from January to March the following year.\nScoring records.\nLim Eng Beng of the De La Salle Green Archers currently holds the most points scored in an NCAA seniors' game when he scored 55 points in the 1974 season as he led De La Salle Green Archers to the championship. He scored an average of 32 points in that season which remains the all-time record in average points per game in Philippine Men's NCAA.\nIn 2009, Joshua Saret of the Jose Rizal Light Bombers scored 89 points against Angeles University Foundation to shatter the all-time high mark set by ex-teammate Keith Agovida at 82 points on September 5, 2008, against Malayan Science HS.\nPrior to their record-breaking feats, Letran Squire Marlon Bola Bola held the single-game record of 71 points in 1970.\nSeniors' scoring leaders.\n Notes:"

        "text": "National Olympic Committees that wish to host an Olympic Games select cities within their territories to put forth bids for the Olympic Games. The staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid. Since the creation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, which successfully appropriated the name of the Ancient Greek Olympics to create a modern sporting event, interested cities have rivaled for selection as host of the Summer or Winter Olympic Games.\n51 different cities have been chosen to host the modern Olympics: three in Eastern Europe, five in East Asia, one in South America, three in Oceania, nine in North America and all the others in Western Europe. No Central American, African, Central Asian, Middle Eastern, South Asian, or Southeast Asian city has ever been chosen to host an Olympics.\nDue recent changes at the Olympic Charter,the host city decisions have been made at IOC Sessions between seven to eleven years from the games; for example, the 2020 Summer Olympics were awarded to Tokyo on 7 September 2013, the 2022 Winter Olympics were awarded to Beijing on 31 July 2015, the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2028 Summer Olympics were awarded to Paris and Los Angeles jointly on 13 September 2017, the 2026 Winter Olympics were awarded to Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo on 24 June 2019. The last host city decision was the 2032 Summer Olympics who were awarded to Brisbane on 21 July 2021.\nIOC – IPC co-operation.\nEven with completely different stories, but with common goals, the approach to the Paralympic Games that began in the late 1980s and progressively evolved into a joint organization made during the 2000 Summer Paralympic Games was the bridge to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed in June 2001, an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games starting from the bid process for the 2008 Summer Paralympics.\n However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) and Athens 2004 Organizing Committee (ATHOC) instead chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\" for both events.The agreement was adjusted in 2003 and their first extension was signed in June 2006."

Unlike the WSOP events that followed it, which are decided using a freeze-out tournament, the 1970 champion was decided from a vote by the players. Jack Binion invited the best seven poker players in America to his Binion's Horseshoe casino in Las Vegas, Nevada to decide who was America's best poker player.\nAfter a cash game session, Johnny Moss was voted the best in the world by \"Amarillo Slim\" Preston, Sailor Roberts, Doyle Brunson, Puggy Pearson, Crandell Addington, and Carl Cannon. Moss was awarded a silver cup rather than a bracelet, which was not established as the prize until 1976.\nAccording to an apocryphal legend, two votes were taken to determine the best player in the world. In the first, the players were asked to vote for the best player, and, the story goes, each voted for himself. In the second vote, they were asked to vote for the second-best player, and Moss won the vote and was awarded the title."

        "title": "Donald Ross (golf course architect)",
        "text": "Donald James Ross (November 23, 1872 – April 26, 1948) was a professional golfer and golf course designer. Ross was born and raised in Scotland but moved to the United States as a young man. Ross designed dozens of courses across North America and is generally regarded as one of the top golf course designers of all time.\nEarly life.\nRoss was born in Dornoch, Scotland. Ross got his first job at the Royal Dornoch Golf Club, where he played while growing up, working as a greens keeper. Ross started his career by being an apprentice to Old Tom Morris at St Andrews in Scotland around 1899. \nProfessional career.\nWith the help of an American agronomy student, fellow Scotsman Robert White from St. Andrews, Ross decided to move to America. Ross invested all his life savings to move to the United States and walked off the boat with only $2. After his year long apprenticeship he went back to the Royal Dornoch Golf Club where he honed his playing abilities while also taking care of the greens and making clubs.\nRoss learned several skills related to golf throughout his life such as greens keeping, club making, golf pro, and architect. Later in 1899, with the encouragement and support of Harvard astronomy professor Robert W. Willson, he obtained his first job in America at Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts. In 1900, he was appointed as the golf professional at the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, where he began his course design career and eventually designed four courses. He then began running a substantial practice with summer offices in Little Compton, Rhode Island. At its height, Donald J. Ross and Associates, as his practice was known, oversaw the work of thousands of people. However, Ross always kept up his professional golf standing.\nRoss won three North and South Opens (1903, 1905, 1906) and two Massachusetts Opens (1905, 1911). He also finished fifth in the 1903 U.S. Open and eighth in the 1910 Open Championship. As his fame grew, he began to teach and play less and to focus on golf course design.\nWhile working at the Oakley Country Club, Ross had left an impression on the president of the Boston Athletic Association at the time, Edward E. Babb. During an exchange in 1910 between Babb and Joseph L. Wyckoff, a business partner of stationary maker White &amp; Wyckoff in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Wyckoff remarked that he wished to find a man who \"really knew about the laying out a golf course\" for the Mount Tom Golf Club, today known as Wyckoff Country Club. Babb introduced Wyckoff to Ross later that year, bringing him back to the course, where he suggested key changes, but was unable to prepare plans as he had just signed a two-year contract as professional for the Essex County Country Club. Completing this contract he returned to Holyoke in 1914 where he was put up in a house built for him by Wyckoff, who as an executive committee member of the Massachusetts Golf Association, saw himself as a patron of Ross, and offered him financial backing to move from being both an architect and golf pro, to focusing his career mainly in golf course architecture. It is unknown what duration or regularity Ross lived in Holyoke, as he travelled often, even spending time designing a course in Cuba during his tenure in Manchester that previous year, though a \"Boston Herald\" article still placed him in Holyoke in 1919. He would work with the Mount Tom Club for many years, welcoming Holyoke neighbors visiting his winter home in Pinehurst, completing a full redesign of the Mt. Tom course by 1922, and later serving as a pallbearer for Wyckoff following his death in 1931. Ross's work in Holyoke would remain largely untouched until the construction of I-91 in 1965 left only 5 fairways of his design today.\nAlthough Ross was a competitive golfer, he is primarily known for his work as a course designer. In his time as a designer he is credited with roughly 400 course designs or redesigns between 1900 and 1948. Some of his early work was in Virginia and includes Jefferson Lakeside Country Club and Sewell's Point Golf Course. He also designed the Municipal Golf Course at Asheville, North Carolina in 1927. Ross also designed Whippoorwill Country Club, in Armonk, New York; however, Charles Banks was hired by Whippoorwill to redesign the course in 1928. He also designed a 9-hole course in northern New York, known as the Schroon Lake Municipal Golf Club in 1918. He designed the Hope Valley Country Club in Durham, North Carolina in 1927.\nIn the 1930s, he revolutionized greenskeeping practices in the southern United States when he oversaw the transition of the putting surfaces at Pinehurst No. 2 from oiled sand to Bermuda grass. Ross also designed the course at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina. Currently, Sedgefield Country Club is one of only three regular Donald Ross designs on the PGA Tour.\nDesign elements.\nWhat allows a Donald Ross golf course to stand out is the design principles and elements he used. He displayed great attention to detail. Often he created challenging courses with very little earth moving; according to Jack Nicklaus, \"His stamp as an architect was naturalness.\" Some of his designs include the \"turtleback\" greens, a Ross double plateau, and The Punchbowl. The route the golfer had to take was an important decision Ross had to make and he favored very clear routes that would not require much walking. When he would design a par-4 hole, he favored an uphill short hole. Ross often created holes which invited run-up shots but had severe trouble at the back of the green, typically in the form of fall-away slopes. All of these exemplify his naturalness design philosophy which did not require intense earth moving, he simply let the lay of the land dictate what each and every hole should be. Ross would go into designing a new course with the thought to \"make each hole present a different problem. So arrange it that every stroke must be made with a full concentration and attention necessary to good golf. Build each hole in such a manner that it waste none of the ground at my disposal and takes advantage of every possibility I can see.\" His most widely known trademark is the crowned or \"turtleback\" green, most famously seen on Pinehurst No. 2, though golf architecture writer Ron Whitten argued in \"Golf Digest\" in 2005 that the effect had become exaggerated compared to Ross's intention because greenkeeping practices at Pinehurst had raised the center of the greens.\nDeath.\nRoss died while completing his final design at Raleigh Country Club in North Carolina. He is buried in Newton Cemetery in Newton, Massachusetts.\nResults in major championships.\nDNP = Did not play&lt;br&gt;\nWD = Withdrew&lt;br&gt;\nCUT = missed the half-way cut&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place&lt;br&gt;\nYellow background for top-10"

        "title": "The Skeleton Key",
        "text": "The Skeleton Key is a 2005 American Southern Gothic supernatural horror film directed by Iain Softley, written by Ehren Kruger, and starring Kate Hudson, Gena Rowlands, John Hurt, Peter Sarsgaard, and Joy Bryant. The narrative follows a New Orleans hospice nurse who begins a job at a Terrebonne Parish plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house, its former inhabitants, and Hoodoo rituals and spells that took place there.\nPlot.\nCaroline Ellis, a hospice aide, quits her position at a nursing home and is hired as the caretaker of an isolated plantation house in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. The aging matron of the house, Violet Devereaux, needs help looking after her husband Benjamin, who was mostly paralyzed by an apparent stroke. At the insistence of the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall, Caroline accepts the position.\nAfter Ben attempts to escape his room during a storm, Caroline investigates the house's attic, where Violet said Ben suffered his stroke; she uses a skeleton key which Violet gave her. She discovers a secret room filled with ritual paraphernalia. Caroline confronts Violet, who reveals that the room used to belong to two African American servants who were employed at the house 90 years before. The servants, Mama Cecile and Papa Justify, were renowned hoodoo practitioners; they were lynched after conducting a ritual with the owners' two children, from whom Violet and Ben later bought the house. Violet tells Caroline that they keep no mirrors in the house because they see reflections of Cecile and Justify in them. Caroline borrows a phonograph record from the attic: \"Conjure of Sacrifice,\" a recording of Papa Justify reciting a hoodoo ritual.\nCaroline surmises that Ben's stroke was caused by hoodoo, but believes that his paralytic state is a nocebo effect induced by his own belief, rather than something supernatural. Taking advice from her friend Jill, Caroline visits a hidden hoodoo shop in a nearby laundromat, where a hoodoo woman gives her tools and instructions to cure Ben. After she conducts the ritual, Ben regains some ability to move and speak and he begs Caroline to get him away from Violet.\nCaroline tells Luke she is suspicious of Violet, but he remains skeptical. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a hoodoo defense; supposedly, no one who means one harm can pass a line of brick dust. She asks one of the proprietors, a blind woman, about the \"Conjure of Sacrifice\", which she learns is a spell wherein the caster steals the remaining years of life from the victim. Increasingly convinced of hoodoo's authenticity, Caroline fears that Violet will soon cast the spell on Ben.\nCaroline discovers that Violet is unable to pass a line of brick dust laid across one of the house's doorways, confirming her suspicions. She incapacitates Violet and attempts to escape the house with Ben, but the front gate is chained shut. Caroline hides Ben on the property and enters Luke's office for help. Luke, revealed to be Violet's accomplice, brings Caroline back to the house. Caroline escapes, gets into a fight with Violet, and violently pushes her down the stairs, breaking her legs in the process. With strategic use of brick dust, Caroline flees to the attic, calls 9-1-1 and Jill for help, and casts what she believes is a protective spell. Violet, having caught up with her, reveals she actually trapped herself inside a protective circle. Violet pushes a full-length mirror at Caroline, which reflects the original owner's daughter, then Violet, and lastly Mama Cecile. A recording of the \"Conjure of Sacrifice\" plays, and the two switch bodies.\nViolet (revealed to be Mama Cecile, who had been occupying Violet's body through the Conjure) wakes up in Caroline's body, and force-feeds Caroline (now in Violet's body) a potion that induces a stroke-like paralytic state like Ben's. Luke (actually Papa Justify) arrives upstairs, revealing that Mama Cecile and Papa Justify have been conducting the Conjure of Sacrifice on new people since their supposed deaths; they had swapped places with the two children just before the lynching. Because hoodoo is supposedly only effective on those who believe in it, Cecile and Justify had to wait for Caroline to come to believe in hoodoo through her own investigation.\nEmergency services arrive the next morning and take Caroline and Ben away, trapped in the paralyzed dying bodies; when Jill arrives, \"Luke\" tells her that the Devereauxes left the house to Caroline, ensuring that Cecile and Justify will continue to occupy the house.\nProduction.\n\"The Skeleton Key\" was filmed at the Felicity Plantation, located on the Mississippi River in Saint James Parish, Louisiana.\nRelease.\n\"The Skeleton Key\" was released in the U.S. on August 12, 2005, after having received an earlier release date of July 29, 2005 in the United Kingdom. It grossed $92 million worldwide. In the U.S., it took in $16.1 million in its first weekend, reaching number 2 at the box office; the total US gross was $47.9 million.\nReception.\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 37% of 149 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Thanks to its creaky and formulaic script, \"The Skeleton Key\" is more mumbo-jumbo than hoodoo and more dull than scary.\" Metacritic rated it 47/100 based on 32 reviews.\nMost of the reviews were mixed. Roger Ebert's review wrote, \"\"The Skeleton Key\" is one of those movies that explains too much while it is explaining too little, and leaves us with a surprise at the end that makes more sense the less we think about it. But the movie's mastery of technique makes up for a lot.\" \"The Guardian\"s Peter Bradshaw awarded the film three out of five stars, noting: \"It's a pretty thankless role for poor John Hurt, and there are some plot holes. But there's some shrewd satire of racism as the modern south's persistent, dirty little secret and screenwriter Ehren Kruger's third act conjures up a neat little shiver.\" Carina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film, calling it \"tightly plotted and suspenseful enough to keep you guessing until the satisfying, unexpected end, which is worth suspending disbelief for,\" adding that \"Hudson holds her own among impressive company. Not that Hurt has a whole lot to do other than grab an occasional wrist and recoil at his face in the mirror, and the usually measured Sarsgaard oversells it a bit, but Rowlands takes to the part like a fly to a shucked oyster.\"\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" criticized the film for its plot, describing it as \"enjoyably inane,\" and also noted that the film \"indulges in almost every conceivable regional and [Southern Gothic] genre cliché.\" \"USA Today\" wrote that the film \"employs intriguing camera angles to heighten some of the suspense. It's too bad the movie goes over the top and falls apart in the last third.\" Stephanie Zacharek wrote in \"Salon\": \"Softley, working from a script by Ehren Kruger, puts so much care into layering moods and textures that he doesn't always scoot the action along as briskly as he should.\" In \"The Seattle Times\", Moira McDonald wrote that the film is \"occasionally scary but more often silly.\" In her review for \"The Austin Chronicle\", Marjorie Baumgarten wrote: \"Director Softley again shows his gifts for creating atmospheric milieus...Yet the movie, overall, lacks tension and suspense. In \"Film Journal International\", Edward Alter wrote that, \"Iain Softley (\"K-Pax\") and cinematographer Dan Mindel make the most of the setting,\" but concluded that the film was, \"a paint-by-numbers supernatural thriller that's more interesting for its locations than for its story.\"\nConnie Ogle in \"The Miami Herald\" wote \"it's reasonably entertaining despite an abundance of haunted-house cliches, the usual inexplicable scary-movie behavior, and an almost-naked John Hurt.\" Jennie Punter in \"The Globe and Mail\" called the film, \"stylishly made but disappointingly lightweight.\" Writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", Jessica Reeves called the film \"serviceable but ultimately disappointing\". In his annual film guide, Leonard Maltin rated the film mediocre, stating that it was \"well-produced and occasionally suspenseful, but populated by unpleasant characters and a story that moves too slowly.\" In the annual \"DVD &amp; Video Guide\", Marsha Porter wrote, \"A few good scares can't compensate for a sluggish pace, and the climactic twist comes as a surprise only because it doesn't make sense.\""

        "title": "Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium",
        "text": "The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi &amp; District Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. It was established in 1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.\nIn a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.\nOn 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: \"It was Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant and many others could make India proud.\" Arun Jaitley has also been credited with turning the stadium into a modern facility, increasing its seating capacity and building better facilities for players during his tenure as DDCA president. The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi. After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the \"Feroz Shah Kotla Ground\".\nAs of 2024, the India national cricket team had been undefeated for over 37 years in Test matches. India's 11-year unbeaten run in ODIs was brought to an end during New Zealand's tour of India in 2016-17 where New Zealand defeated India by 6 runs.\nHistory.\nThe first Test match at this venue was played on 10 November 1948 when India took on the West Indies.\nRecords.\nIn 1952, playing against Pakistan, Hemu Adhikari and Ghulam Ahmed were involved in a record tenth wicket stand of 111 runs – a record that still stands. In 1965, S Venkataraghavan, in his debut series, demolished the New Zealand line up with figures of 8 for 72 and 4 for 80. In 1969–70, Bishen Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna combined to spin India to a famous seven wicket win over Australia, the duo picking 18 wickets between themselves.\nIn 1981, Geoff Boycott surpassed Gary Sobers' world record test aggregate.\nIn 1983, Sunil Gavaskar hit his 29th test ton in this ground to equal Don Bradman's then record tally of 29 centuries.\nIn 1999, Anil Kumble took all 10 wickets in an innings against Pakistan, to become only the second bowler to achieve this feat after Jim Laker.\nIn December 2005, Sachin Tendulkar scored his 35th test century against Sri Lanka to break Sunil Gavaskar record of the most test centuries.\n2009 Dangerous pitch.\nOn 27 December 2009, an ODI match between India and Sri Lanka was called off because pitch conditions were classed as unfit to host a match. Based on match referee's report of the match, the ground was banned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for 12 months. International cricket returned as stadium at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nIndian Premier League.\nSince 2008 the stadium has been the home of the Delhi Capitals (formerly Delhi Daredevils) of the Indian Premier League.\n2017 Smog incident.\nDuring the second day of third test of Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2017-18 at Delhi, smog forced Sri Lanka cricketers to stop play and wear anti-pollution masks, a rare sight in terms of play interruptions. Cricketer Lahiru Gamage reported to have shortness of breath. Nic Pothas, coach of Sri Lankan cricket team, reported that cricketer Suranga Lakmal had vomited regularly due to severe pollution effect on the Delhi ground. There was a haltage of play between 12:32pm to 12:49pm, which caused Indian coach Ravi Shastri to come out to consult with the on-field umpires. BCCI president C. K. Khanna accused the Sri Lankan team of making fuss while Indian spectators called the team \"melodramatic\". On day 4, India's Mohammed Shami was also seen vomiting on the field.\nFollowing the match, both participating countries criticised the choice to play the Test in Delhi with the high levels of pollution. The Sri Lanka manager Asanka Gurusinha said that both teams were using oxygen cylinders in their dressing rooms due to breathing difficulties, and suggested the use of air-quality meters in future fixtures. President of the Indian Medical Association, KK Agarwal, said that playing in such conditions could result in lung and heart disease, and recommended the inclusion of atmospheric pollution as a factor in the assessment criteria for a match.\nStatistics.\nIndian cricket team have won 10 test matches here until date out of 18 test matches.(Matches which have loss or win)\nVarious format records.\nTest record.\nThe highest test score on this ground is by the West Indies, when they scored 644–8 in 1959 and 631 all out in 1948. The next highest score was made by India scoring 613–7 in 2008. The most runs scored here is by Dilip Vengsarkar (673 runs), followed by Sunil Gavaskar (668 runs) and Sachin Tendulkar (643 runs). The most wickets taken here is by Anil Kumble (58 wickets), followed by Kapil Dev (32 wickets) and R Ashwin (27 wickets).\nODI record.\nODI Cricket World Cup.\nThis stadium has hosted One Day International (ODI) matches when India hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023.\nTwenty20 internationals.\n2016 ICC World Twenty20.\nThe ground was selected to host matches in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Three matches from Group A were scheduled to be played here as well as one semi-final. The first ever Twenty20 International held at the ground was a Group A match between England and Afghanistan.\nIndian cricket team matches.\nThe ground hosted a T20I match on 1 November 2017 between India and New Zealand, the first ever Indian International Twenty-20 at this ground and also the last international match for Ashish Nehra. On the eve of his farewell game, the DDCA renamed one end of the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground as \"Ashish Nehra End\" for one day, making Nehra the second bowler in cricket history, after James Anderson (cricketer), to have bowled from an end named after him.\nThe first match of the Bangladesh tour of India 2019–20, the T20I in Delhi, was the 1,000th men's Twenty20 International match was played on 3 November 2019. Bangladesh won the match by seven wickets, to record their first ever victory against India in the format.\nAccessibility.\nRoad: Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg\nbus stops : Ambedkar stadium bus stop, Delhi gate bus stop, Saheed park bus stop, Ambedkar stadium terminal, Darya Ganj, Darya Ganj Golcha Cinema\nDelhi Metro: Delhi Gate Metro Station\nIndian Railways: Tilak Bridge railway station (TKJ)\nAir: Indira Gandhi International Airport"

        "text": "The Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground is a cricket ground located in the city of Nagpur.\nThe ground is known as the VCA Ground and belongs to the Central Zone. The first match was played here in October 1969. As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted nine Tests and 14 ODIs.\nIt has been replaced by a new stadium called Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium as an international cricket stadium. It continues to be used by the Vidarbha and Uttar Pradesh cricket teams.\nSunil Gavaskar scored his only one day century here against New Zealand in the 1987 Reliance World Cup.\nIn 1995, during the 5th ODI between India and New Zealand, a wall in the East Stand collapsed, killing 9 people and injuring 70 others.\nHistory.\nThe tenth Test venue in the country, the Vidarbha Cricket Association-managed ground, probably the only international venue where you can walk straight into the ground from the road, has always made headlines for various reasons.\nChetan Sharma takes the first Cricket World Cup hat-trick in history, with the wickets of Ken Rutherford, Ian Smith and Ewen Chatfield in Nagpur. All three were bowled.\nSunil Gavaskar got his only one-day, and World Cup, century here when India won by a huge margin against New Zealand in their final league encounter of the 1987 Reliance World Cup. This is the second best ground for Sachin Tendulkar when it comes to centuries. \nSachin Tendulkar has three here after four in Chepauk.\nThe pitch was just like any other docile pitch, until the BCCI-appointed pitch committee recommended the re-laying of the wicket in 1999. It took a while for the wicket to assume the true shape that it was designed to.\nThe unique thing about this wicket is the 30-inch deep double-brick layer (normally there is a 15-inch brick layer) which facilitates extra pace and bounce. This was a factor when Australia conquered the 'final frontier' as they beat India handsomely in the third Test to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\nThe local critics were up-in-arms at how the curator ignored the home team's cause and prepared a fast wicket that helped the opposition fast bowlers. But the curator insisted that he had simply followed the instructions of the pitch panel. Today Nagpur is one of the only grounds to assist genuine fast bowlers in pace and movement and several first-class games in the 2004/05 season ended within three days as the medium-pacers reaped rich rewards."

        "text": "Indian Cricket was a cricket yearbook published by \"The Hindu\" from 1946–47 to 2004. There was no 2003 issue and so there are 57 editions in all. During most of its run it was the principal annual of its kind in India. The editions were originally dated by the season covered (e.g., 1946–47) but, since the 1962 edition, the date is the calendar year of publication.\n\"Indian Cricket\" was founded in 1946–47 under the editorship of S. K. Gurunathan who continued in that role until his death in 1966. He was succeeded by P. N. Sundaresan, sports editor of \"The Hindu\" and Indian cricket correspondent of \"Wisden Cricketer's Almanack\". G. Viswanath edited the most recent issues.\nThe first edition was only 104 pages long, whereas the 2004 edition had 1240 pages. The early issues were paperbacked and then a hardbacked standard edition was issued from 1972.\n\"Indian Cricket\" was largely inspired by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". It had the same page size as Wisden and replicated many of Wisden's usual features. It included domestic cricket matches in India and matches played by Indian teams abroad. Match details included brief reports and full scores. There was a detailed statistics section on domestic cricket, India in Test cricket, a small section on Test cricket abroad and obituaries. From its inception, \"Indian Cricket\" had a \"Five Cricketers of the Year\" award, based on Wisden. From 1952, there was a \"special portrait\" section that profiled a notable ex-cricketer.\nFrom 1957–58 to 1964–65, there was a rival publication called \"The Indian Cricket Field Annual\" edited by Dicky Rutnagur. This also contained full scores of all first-class matches in India and a biographical section on current players. Anandji Dossa was the statistical editor of this publication."

Teams raced in the first and third heats in the order of the draw. The second heat was raced in order of ranking after the first heat, and the fourth heat is raced in order of the ranking after the first three heats. Total time for the four heats determined the final rank.\nQualification.\nThe qualification was based on the results of pilots, with other members of a bobsleigh crew being selected by their National Olympic Committees. In the two man event, the top 22 pilots from the World Cup 2005–2006 season, the top four from the European Challenge Cup, and the top two from the North American Challenge Cup all qualified, subject to limits on number of crews per NOC. The four man event qualification was identical except that the World Cup season qualifies only 20 pilots. The two-woman event allowed the top 15 pilots from the World Cup 2005–2006 season. NOCs may not have selected other pilots than those who were within the qualifying limits, though if more than two pilots have qualified the selection was made by each individual NOC.\nThe host nation is guaranteed at least one crew in each event. In addition, all five of the Olympic continents must be represented, with at least one crew in a men's event and one crew in the two woman event. Each nation is limited to two bobsleighs in each event.\nParticipating NOCs.\nTwenty two nations contributed bobsleighs to the events. "

        "text": "In 2001, during the centennial celebration of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, Minor League Baseball tasked baseball historians Bill Weiss and Marshall Wright to develop a list of the top 100 best minor league baseball teams of the century. Their list includes 69 distinct franchises from across the United States and in Canada and Mexico. There are representatives from every decade of the century.\nWeiss and Wright developed a statistical formula to evaluate teams. First, a rating was given to each league. They assigned 100 points for Triple-A leagues down to 20 points for Class D leagues. The equivalent classifications of each league were used to adjust for changes in the minor league structure since 1900. Next, individual teams were graded based on winning percentage and total wins in order to assess each team's strength against its league and its season-long performance. The combination of these three metrics resulted in a statistical list of the century's top teams. Weiss and Wright further took into account intangibles such as winning a pennant, significant achievements, or reputation in creating their final list.\nOf the 69 franchises to make the list, 14 appeared more than once. The Baltimore Orioles took 6 places on the list, the most of any team, followed by the Ft. Worth Panthers and Toronto Maple Leafs (5), Newark Bears and San Francisco Seals (4); Kansas City Blues, Los Angeles Angels, and St. Paul Saints (3); and Charlotte Hornets, Columbus Senators/Red Birds, Houston Buffaloes, Indianapolis Indians, Memphis Chicks, and Milwaukee Brewers (2). Thirty leagues are represented on the list. The league with the most entrants is the International League with 17. The other top leagues are the American Association (13); Pacific Coast League (10); Eastern League and Texas League (8); California League, Western Association, and Western League (4). Thirty-one teams competed at the Double-A classification level, the most of any class, followed by Class A (24); Class C (12); Class B (11); Triple-A (10); Class D (7); Class A1 and independent (2); and Class A-Advanced (1). Twenty-seven teams competed in the 1920s, the most of any decade, followed by the 1940s (16); 1930s (13); 1900s and 1950s (10); 1910s and 1980s (6); 1970s (5); 1990s (4); and 1960s (3)."

        "text": "John Brian Moore (born March 3, 1958) is an American former professional basketball player. Moore played college basketball for The University of Texas at Austin under head coaches Leon Black and Abe Lemons from 1975 to 1979. He spent his entire NBA career playing point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, save one game for the New Jersey Nets. A rare illness caused Moore to have his career put on hold in early 1986.\nCollege career.\nMoore started all 112 games of his four-year college career at Texas. He finished his career as Texas' all-time career assists leader, with 714, and remains second all-time in assists per game, averaging 6.38 assists over the course of his four years as the Longhorns' point guard. His per-game average of 8.34 assists as a senior remains a UT men's basketball record. Moore also posted a double-figure scoring average in each of his four seasons. He received first-team All-Southwest Conference (SWC) honors following his senior season.\nAs a junior, Moore helped guide the Abe Lemons-coached 1977–78 Longhorns basketball team to a 26–5 overall record (then tied with Jack Gray's 1947 Final Four team for the most wins in a single season in school history), a share of the Southwest Conference championship, and the 1978 National Invitation Tournament championship. The following season, Moore helped Texas win a share of the SWC championship for the second consecutive year, defeat a school-record three AP-ranked teams, advance to the 1979 NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed, and finish the season with an overall record of 21–8, giving the Longhorns their first back-to-back seasons of 20 or more wins in 31 years.\nNBA career.\nMoore was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1979 NBA draft as the 43rd overall pick, then the second-highest NBA draft position for any basketball player in UT history.\nOver 520 games in his NBA career, Moore averaged 9.4 points, 7.4 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 1.96 steals per game, and a field goal percentage of 46.0.\nMoore recorded 20 assists during three games in his career, once during the playoffs, making him one of only seven players to record 20 assists or more in a playoff game. He also had two games of nine or more steals in a game, being one of only 50 different players to record nine or more steals in a game.\nMoore is one of ten players to have his number (\"00\") retired by the Spurs.\nCoaching career.\nMoore made his coaching debut in the 2010–11 season with the Austin Toros of the NBA D-League as an assistant coach.\nIn December 2012 Moore was named head coach of the Corpus Christi Clutch of the American Basketball League. 10 of 12 teams did not survive the first ABL season of 2013, including the Clutch.\nIn the Fall of 2013 Moore was named head coach the South Texas Stingrays, an expansion team in the ABA. Team majority owner Marlon Minifee (who also owns the Texas Fuel) decided not to bring back the Stingrays to Brownsville for 2014–15, opting to form a new team: Central Texas Swarm (now known as the Am-Mex Swarm). Moore is currently head coach of the Swarm."

        "title": "Lob (tennis)",
        "text": "A lob in tennis involves hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court. It can be used as an offensive or defensive weapon.\nHistory.\nA lob is usually hit when an opponent is standing near the net, waiting to volley. The ball should pass over the opponent and into the open court behind. A good offensive lob cannot be reached by the opponent, yet it is low enough and has enough pace and spin so that the opponent can not run back and chase it down. It can win the point outright, although with some risks involved. Topspin greatly enhances the effectiveness of an offensive lob but also makes the stroke more difficult. When executing the lob, players usually hit the ball at an angle between 0 degrees (flat) and 45 degrees (diagonal). Some players, such as Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Andy Murray and Lleyton Hewitt, have developed good offensive lobs.\nA defensive lob requires the opponent to retreat to the \"baseline\" and prolongs the point. When a player is out of court, playing a defensive lob can buy time to run back and adopt a better defensive position.\nAn unsuccessful lob is susceptible to being smashed.\nIn doubles, spin or slice is applied to the lob, so it will go over the head of a player at the net and bounce away from the baseline player.\nSome players are able to manipulate a lob so that it appears the shot is overhit, but dips enough to fall within the baseline, often deceiving the opponent. This is created by generating a great amount of backspin, slicing or cutting the ball over the head of the other player. This shot, which can also be hit with tremendous topspin, is called a \"moon volley or moon lob.\nThe lob was introduced by Frank Hadow, the second Wimbledon champion, using the technique to defeat Spencer Gore.\nGrass courts dominated the early Grand Slams, with three of the four major tournaments featuring the soft surface of the natural ground. Because of this, the ball could always touch the grass on the field, and later on, in a match, such coverings became torn resulting in poor bounces. This made the majority of players to prefer to serve as well as volley to avoid bad bounces. Initially, there were two significant styles of playing tennis.\nThere was Australia's style, as well as, American style. The Aussies were proponents of the \"one grip fits all\" philosophy, and stripped tennis down to its bare basics. The rule insisted that if one had to use \"one grip for all,\" it needed to be the continental grip. In addition to that continental grip, their primary tactic was to serve and volley, but they also applied the backhands. Their weakest area was the forehand.\nThe second evolution was the reverse forehand lob. This lob became associated with the tennis player Pete Sampras. Sampras, even today, remains cemented among the legendary for his huge serve. The reverse forehand lob was a newly designed passing shot, for this the forehand became a stable of the current passing shot. This shot was to be either a short hit, a sharp crosscut, or maybe hit deep up the line.\nMost of the tennis court offers a lot of space near the baseline, and this has led the majority of players to stand at the baseline and attempt the standing back lob. This maneuver was mostly for the defensive players, as they used it to strike the ball faster, as well as, at sharp angles, mainly during the 1970s.\nThe windshield-wiper forehand can also provide a lob shot in tennis. During the old days, the forehand was often accompanied by a high follow-through. Used by players such as Pete Sampras, it reached its novelty in the 1990s but became the staple in the 2000s. \nThe next type of lob that appeared on the tennis scene was called the \"squash shot forehand,\" it was a defensive lob, and it was great during its day. Today this shot offers a solution to the sole forehand. In the old days, the \"Recovery slice backhand\" lob was used to approach the net. In addition to that, it was more offensive shot. Today it is used to recover.\n\"The swinging volley,\" was an innovation of Lendl’s. It employed strong topspin forehands and even more of the volley. It is also used today by players such as Roger Federer but was more common in the 1980s. Big servers used it the most.\nThe \"kick serve\" lob has been in use for the relatively extended period. Though it has little fame, it is still used to have the ball \"kick\" over the opponents head during serving."

        "text": "WWE WrestleMania 21, also known simply as WrestleMania 21 or Wrestlemania XXI, is a professional wrestling video game released exclusively for the Xbox in 2005. It was published by THQ and developed by Studio Gigante based on the WWE pay-per event of the same name though it does feature the Wrestlemania XX event and not its namesake. It is also the successor to \"Raw 2\". The game was the last WWE game released on the original Xbox. \"WWE Wrestlemania 21\" was the last game to be released by Studio Gigante.\nGameplay.\n\"WWE WrestleMania 21\" includes superstars from WWE Raw 2 and new wrestlers, including: Charlie Haas, Jackie Gayda, Lance Cade, René Duprée, Shelton Benjamin, and Eugene. The game features a new reversal system dubbed the \"Pro Reversal System\". This feature allows for simpler functionality with reversing an opponent's move.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"WrestleMania 21\" was first announced by THQ just before E3 2004, stating that the game would be replacing the \"Raw\" video game series. Microsoft accidentally sent an older broken version of the game to the disc manufacturer resulting in gamers being unable to connect to the Xbox Live service upon release until a downloadable patch was made available soon thereafter. Because it is now impossible to download the latest update from Xbox Live, the Platimum Hits (silver disc) version contained the latest patch. A number of game-breaking bugs were fixed and gameplay adjustments were made.\nReception.\nDespite an upgrade in visuals, and a fully voiced career-mode, the game was met with very mixed reception due to its gameplay. Rather than being an upgrade of a pre-existing game engine, it was virtually built from the ground up, as well as containing numerous glitches that crippled the gameplay experience. In their review of the game, GameSpot mentioned that the hit detection was horrible. Other problems included a slow and unresponsive AI taking away from the difficulty, or drastically decreasing the length of a match. A Create-a-Wrestler mode lacked a variety of moves, and items for the wrestler being created. While specialty matches are included within the game, they are only playable in 1 on 1. Among other problems, VideoGamer.com mentioned that the game had sloppy controls. IGN gave the game a rating of 6 out of 10, praising the high quality visuals, but like other reviews took issue with the flaws in the gameplay."

        "title": "Steve Price (rugby league, born 1974)",
        "text": "Steven John Price (born 12 March 1974) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s primarily as a . An Australian international representative, he retired as Queensland's most capped State of Origin forward. Price captained Sydney club, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs (with whom he won the 1995 and 2004 premierships) as well as New Zealand NRL club, the Warriors.\nBackground.\nBorn in Dalby, Queensland, Price grew up in Toowoomba, where he attended Harristown State High School. Price was spotted playing rugby league for the Newtown Lions club in Toowoomba and was signed to the New South Wales Rugby League premiership club, Sydney's Canterbury Bulldogs in 1993.\nPlaying career.\nCanterbury-Bankstown.\nDuring the 1994 NSWRL season Price made his first grade debut for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at Belmore Sports Ground on 3 July against the Balmain Tigers. It was a great rookie year for Price as his side finished the regular season as minor premiers on top of the ladder and eventually going on to reach the 1994 Grand Final which they lost to Mal Meninga's Canberra Raiders. The disappointment of losing the Grand Final did not last long for Price, as the following year in the 1995 season, Canterbury reached their second consecutive Grand Final to come up against the Manly Sea Eagles. Price was named on the starting line-up and as a headgear-wearing second-rower scored the first try of the game which the Bulldogs eventually won 17–4, giving Price his first taste of premiership victory. The experience of finals football so early in his career was a positive for Price as he established a reputation as an effective front rower/prop and second rower with a high work rate.\nDuring the 1998 season Price made his debut for Queensland in game one of the 1998 State of Origin series, scoring a crucial try on debut in a match that Queensland would go on to win by 1 point with a conversion after the siren. He would retain his spot for the following two matches of series in which Queensland were victorious two games to one. His performance at representative level was then awarded with the highest honour for an Australian player as he was announced in the 1998 Kangaroos squad. In the same year Steve Price and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs made a terrific finals run where, after finishing the season in 9th position, they won four must-win matches to make it all the way through to the 1998 NRL Grand Final against the Brisbane Broncos which they lost 38–12.\nWhen Bulldogs captain Darren Britt left the club at the end of 2001, coach Steve Folkes opted for Price to captain the side for 2002. He proved to be a great captain and the Bulldogs finished the 2002 season with 20 wins, 1 draw and only 3 losses, although they would not play in the finals due to the salary cap breach. 2003 was another strong year for Price as he was awarded Player of the Year by magazine Rugby League Week; he also captained the sides to 18 regular season wins and a semi-final berth which they lost to the Sydney Roosters. In 2004 Price had a stellar performance playing for Queensland and was awarded the Ron McAuliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series.\nDuring the transfer period in 2004 it was announced that it would be his last year with the Bulldogs after ten years of service, as he was signing with the New Zealand Warriors for 2005. Price could not have gone out in better style as the Bulldogs finished second on the ladder, missing out on the minor premiership by points difference. Price's fairytale ending was then shattered when he tore his medial ligament the week before the Grand Final. His side played well without their inspirational captain and went on to win 16–13 to send Price out with another Grand Final success, even though he did not compete in the final game.\nNew Zealand Warriors.\nWhen Price left Canterbury, who had appeared in the finals consistently and performed very well, he went to join the Warriors who had experienced their worst ever season in 2004, finishing 14th of 15 teams and winning only 6 games all year. Price was immediately appointed captain of the squad and clearly made an impact as the team remained competitive in all of their matches. In the opening match of the 2005 State of Origin series Price was named man of the match. The Warriors had a good chance to make the finals; however, a four-match losing streak late in the season removed those chances and they finished the 2005 season 11th, a slight improvement from the previous year.\nEven at the age of 33 and after 13 years playing professional football, the 2007 season proved to be one of his career bests. In Round 14 Steve Price broke his own record of 'metres gained by a forward' playing against the Cronulla Sharks. Price's previous record was 272 metres; he eclipsed this by gaining 306 metres from 33 hit-ups. Seven weeks later in round 21 Price broke his own record again, this time against the Sydney Roosters where he ran for a total of 323 m. The Warriors finished the regular season strongly, sitting at the top end of the ladder on 4th position, although they struggled to perform come finals time and dropped out of the competition in the second week of the finals losing to the North Queensland Cowboys. However, Price's own personal performance throughout the year was duly recognised as he was awarded the Captain of the Year &amp; Prop of the Year titles at the 2007 Dally M Awards. He ran 4,515 metres with the ball in 2007, more than any other forward in history.\nIn August 2008, Price was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad. He did not, however, play in the World Cup Final due to tearing his calf in the final training session before the Final which Australia lost to the Kiwis.\nPrice was eligible for England and New Zealand; however, he has stated he will not switch his allegiance from Australia.\nIn April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009.\nOn Sunday 3 May 2009 Price confirmed he would extend his NRL career to a 17th season after signing a one-year contract with the New Zealand Warriors. Already the NRL's oldest player in 2009, Price was 36 at the start of the 2010 season. He was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009. In State of Origin 3, 2009, Price was involved in a fight with Brett White, in which he was knocked unconscious by a right hook from White, and while unconscious, he was lifted up by the jersey and dropped on his head by Justin Poore.\nPrice was replaced as the Warriors club captain for the 2010 season by Simon Mannering, in a move described by the club as building for the future.\nOn 6 April 2010, Price announced his retirement from rugby league at the conclusion of the 2010 NRL season.\nOn 29 June 2010, Price announced his immediate retirement. This was due to a heel injury that he picked up during the off-season. This injury did not heal correctly and resulted in three operations, meaning that he would be unable to take to the field at all during the 2010 NRL season. This meant that although 2010 would be his final season as a professional rugby league player, he would not play a single game.\nPost-playing career.\nPrice graduated from the Southern Cross University with a Masters in Business Administration in 2010 as the Outstanding Young Alumnus of the Year.\nIn the 2011 New Year Honours, Price was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rugby league. The award citation read: \"He began the role (as captain) following the club's worst-ever season and helped rebuild it to become one of the league’s best.\" \"He played a mentoring role to less experienced players. In 2006 he led the team with honesty and integrity while it was investigated by the National Rugby League over salary cap breaches, and in 2007 he was awarded Captain of the Year and Prop of the Year at the Dally M Awards.\" \"Mr Price has been described as 'the most loved Australian in New Zealand sporting history'.\"\nPersonal life.\nPrice is the father of Giants Netball player Jamie-Lee Price and Penrith Panthers NRL player Riley Price."

It was the 106th year of the Stanley Cup being contested.\nThe Sabres were led by captain Michael Peca, head coach Lindy Ruff and goaltender Dominik Hasek.

The Stars defeated the Sabres four games to two to win their first Stanley Cup, becoming the eighth post-1967 expansion team to earn a championship, and the first team based in the Southern United States to win the Cup.\nThe series ended with a controversial triple-overtime goal in game six, when replays showed that Stars forward Brett Hull scored with his skate in the crease. Although the Sabres protested later, the league stated that the goal had been reviewed and was judged as a good goal, since Hull had maintained possession of the puck as it exited the crease just before he shot it.\nBackground.\nBuffalo defeated the Ottawa Senators 4–0, the Boston Bruins 4–2, and Toronto Maple Leafs 4–1 to advance to the Finals.\nDallas defeated the Edmonton Oilers 4–0, the St. Louis Blues 4–2, and the Colorado Avalanche 4–3 to advance to the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe opening game was in Dallas and it was the visiting Buffalo Sabres who struck first, winning 3–2 in overtime. Dallas led 1–0 on a power play goal by Brett Hull, but Stu Barnes and Wayne Primeau scored 5:04 apart in the third to give Buffalo a 2–1 lead. Jere Lehtinen tied the game in the final minute of the third period, but Jason Woolley scored at 15:30 of overtime to give the Sabres the series lead.\nGame two.\nWith three seconds left in the period, Dallas center Mike Modano tripped Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek, and a number of scrums broke out as time expired. Dallas winger Joe Nieuwendyk fought Buffalo center Brian Holzinger in the circle to the right of Hasek. These were the first fighting majors in three years in the final round, and it was also Nieuwendyk's first fighting major in five years in either the playoffs or regular season.\nAfter the scoreless opening period, the teams traded goals in the middle frame. Craig Ludwig's first goal in 102 playoff games gave Dallas its first lead of the game in the third period, but Alexei Zhitnik tied it 71 seconds later. Brett Hull scored on a slap shot, a one-timer on a pass from Tony Hrkac, from the top of the circle to Hasek's left with 2:50 remaining in the game, but Buffalo had an excellent chance to tie the game with Derian Hatcher being assessed a high-sticking minor 19 seconds later. During the power play, Buffalo pulled Hasek for a 6-on-4 attacking advantage, but the Stars were able to kill the penalty, and Hatcher scored an empty-netter just three seconds after emerging from the penalty box. The empty net goal sealed the win for Dallas, and evened the series at one game apiece. Mike Modano left the game with approximately ten minutes to play after suffering a broken wrist.\nGame three.\nThe series shifted to Buffalo for games three and four. It was the visiting Dallas Stars turn to win one on the road, winning 2–1. With Modano hampered by his wrist injury, and Hull leaving the game with a groin injury, Joe Nieuwendyk's two goals, including his sixth game-winner of the playoffs, led Dallas to the win.\nGame four.\nFacing a two games to one deficit in the series, the Sabres came through with a 2–1 victory on Dixon Ward's game-winning goal in the second period.\nGame five.\nWith the series tied at two games apiece and returning to Dallas, Ed Belfour made 23 saves to shut out the Sabres, and move Dallas within one win of the Stanley Cup.\nGame six.\nThe series shifted back to Marine Midland Arena for game six, where the Dallas Stars would seek their first Stanley Cup, while the Buffalo Sabres would fight for a win to extend the series to a seventh and final game.\nDallas, which allowed the first goal in the earlier two games played at Marine Midland Arena, took a 1–0 lead on one of its few scoring chances in the first period when Lehtinen scored his tenth goal of the playoffs at 8:09. The Sabres tied the game with their first goal since the third period of game four when Barnes' wrist shot eluded Belfour with 1:39 to play in the second period.\nThe game remained tied at one through the third period and the first two overtime periods, despite several chances by both teams to score. At 14:51 of the third overtime period, Brett Hull scored to end the series and win Dallas their first Stanley Cup. Joe Nieuwendyk was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs.\nIt was the longest Cup-winning game in Finals history, and the second-longest Finals game overall, after game one of the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals, which ended at 15:13 of the third overtime.\nThis was the first time since 1994 that the Stanley Cup Finals did not end in a sweep. It is the Stars' only Stanley Cup win, while Buffalo has not returned to the Finals since. It was the Sabres' second Stanley Cup Finals appearance; the first was a loss to Philadelphia in 1975. It was the third appearance for the Stars' franchise, and their first since moving to Dallas from Minnesota in 1993.\nHull's series-ending goal.\nIn the third overtime, Jere Lehtinen took a shot from the left circle that was stopped by Dominik Hasek. Brett Hull was not in the crease for the first shot. The rebound came near Hull's left skate, which Hull used to kick the puck to his stick, which was just outside the crease. His left skate entered the crease just before his second shot went in and ended the series.\nWhen league commissioner Gary Bettman was on the ice to hand out the trophies, Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff returned to his bench and began screaming at Bettman to explain why the goal had not been reviewed. In the Sabres' locker room, players who had seen the replays were infuriated. Hasek recalled, \"My first reaction was 'Let's get back on the ice.' But it's 2 o'clock in the morning and I look at everyone and it's like, 'I'm already out of my pants. It's impossible.'\"\nNHL Director of Officiating Bryan Lewis said after the game that the goal had been reviewed, just as every goal that season had been, and the officials in the video review booth had determined that since Hull was deemed to have been in possession of the puck throughout the play, he was allowed to shoot and score a goal, even though one skate had entered the crease before the puck. Hasek and Hull later became teammates on the Detroit Red Wings Stanley Cup winning team in 2002.\nAmong Sabres fans, both the game and the play itself are often simply referred to as \"No Goal\".\nTeam rosters.\nBolded years under Finals appearance indicates year won Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1999 Stanley Cup was presented to Stars captain Derian Hatcher by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Stars 2–1 triple overtime win over the Sabres in game six.\nThe following Stars players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1998–99 Dallas Stars\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC.

Under the U.S. TV contracts that would take effect beginning next season, ABC would take over for Fox as the NHL's network television partner.\nAftermath.\nThe following year, the Dallas Stars returned to the Stanley Cup Finals. They faced the New Jersey Devils, but lost in six games. The Sabres lost in the first round to the Philadelphia Flyers in five games."

        "title": "Tinkoff (cycling team)",
        "text": "Tinkoff () was a Russian-registered professional cycling team from Russia and previously Denmark. It competed in the UCI World Tour. The team was owned by former Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis from 2000 until 2013 and Russian banker Oleg Tinkov from 2013 until it closed in 2016, who provided the team's last sponsor, Russian Tinkoff Bank.\nFounded in 1998 as home-Jack &amp; Jones, the team started in cycling's second division. In 2000 it moved into the top division, now known as the UCI World Tour. Since 2000, under differing sponsor names (Memory Card–Jack &amp; Jones and CSC–Tiscali), the team rode the Tour de France. It has won the overall classification in all three of the Grand Tours. In the 2008 Tour de France, Carlos Sastre won the general classification, Andy Schleck won the young rider classification, and the team won the overall team classification, and Ivan Basso won the 2006 Giro d'Italia, as well as finishing third and second in the 2004 and 2005 Tour de France. In addition, the team has won many major classics, including 6 Monuments.\nThe team won the UCI ProTour's team classification each year from 2005 through 2007, and the team classification in the 2010 UCI World Ranking.\nIn March 2015 the team confirmed that Riis had been removed from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March.\nPhilosophy.\nWhen Bjarne Riis took over in winter 2000, he hired the former Danish Ranger Corps soldier B. S. Christiansen as advisor and they gave CSC a distinct philosophy and training methods. The team works with four values: communication, loyalty, commitment and respect, with the aim of improving teamwork. The team rides for the rider in the best shape on the day, and separates the function of team captain (the rider making decisions) and team leader (the rider trying to win) to avoid pressure on a single rider.\nThe team staff go on yearly outdoor education trips, physical challenges under pressure. According to B.S. Christiansen, the camps teach people \"that they can achieve their goals by cooperating. They have to perform their very best under the worst possible circumstances, where every action has a consequence\". Bobby Julich, one of the riders, said that \"those days in the bush bonded us much closer and given [sic] us the strategies to work as a team in any racing situation\".\nHistory.\nThe company behind the team, initially named Professional Cycling Denmark, was created in autumn 1996 by former amateur cycling world champion Alex Pedersen, Finn Poulsen (representing Bestseller), Torben Kølbæk and Johannes Poulsen (from Herning CK), and Bjarne Riis (then a Team Telekom rider). The team was built on the team license of Danish amateur team Herning CK, with headquarters in Herning, Denmark, with the goal of being picked for the 2000 Tour de France.\nhome–Jack &amp; Jones: 1998–1999.\nThe team was assembled for 1998 with Alex Pedersen and Torben Kølbæk as sports directors. The team started with 11 riders, a mix of first-time professionals with Danish veterans Brian Holm and Jesper Skibby who had competed in the Tour de France several times, Skibby having won stage 5 in 1993. The main sponsors were a Danish real estate agency (home a/s), and a clothes manufacturer (Jack &amp; Jones, a brand owned by Bestseller) and the budget was around €1,000,000 for 1998, including secondary sponsors. The team rode its first season in 2nd Division races, and during the first month both Christian Andersen and Jesper Skibby had minor wins. Holm quit the team in April 1998.\nThe doping scandal in the 1998 Tour de France didn't affect the team directly, but Riis, who was part of the peloton in the Tour de France, was branded a doping cheat in the Danish media in early 1999. He sold his stock in Professional Cycling Denmark.\nThe team finished 32nd best of 1998, and with an increased budget of €2,400,000 combined, the number of riders was increased to 14, with riders of a higher standard. In terms of races won, 1999 was the most successful season until 2005: with 26 UCI victories the team was promoted to the 1st Division. In September 1999 Belgian rider Marc Streel was tested with a hematocrit level of 53.4, a value above 50 being an indicator of EPO doping, and he was fired Home stopped sponsoring the team from the end of the season, citing doping.\nMemory Card–Jack &amp; Jones: 2000.\nFor 2000, Memory Card A/S, a Danish producer of memory cards, stepped in as co-sponsor and Danish cyclist Bo Hamburger was brought in as captain. The 2000 season did not have as many wins as in 1999 but the calibre was higher and the team took part in the 2000 Tour de France.\nIn April 2000 Nicolai Bo Larsen was tested with a 51 hematocrit level, but wasn't fired, as he had been tested with a 47 level the day before. The morning after his result of 51, he again tested 47%. However, the apparent double standards harmed its image in Denmark and Jack &amp; Jones did not prolong sponsorship, despite Bo Larsen's later being acquitted of doping by a medical report.\nIn fall 2000, Riis took over Professional Cycling Denmark and the team. After 2000 the contract with Jack &amp; Jones expired, and Riis did not continue working with Memory Card due to their financial difficulties.\nCSC–Tiscali: 2001–2002.\nCSC (Computer Sciences Corporation) and the European Internet provider World Online took over as sponsors in a combined sponsorship of €4,500,000. World Online was bought by the Italian telecom giant Tiscali and the team changed on 1 July 2001 to CSC-Tiscali.\nIn April 2001, Bo Hamburger tested positive with a newly developed method which distinguished natural EPO from synthetic EPO used in doping by determining the percentage of basic EPO. The first test showed 82.3 which was above the maximum of 80 imposed by the UCI, but as his secondary tests showed both 82.4 and 78.6 he was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2002. Bo Hamburger was released from his contract with CSC-Tiscali in September 2001.\nThe team gained international prominence after signing Laurent Jalabert before 2001, following his many years with the Spanish ONCE team of Manolo Saiz. Jalabert said that, \"I wanted to retire with a French team, but nobody gave me a good offer, so I went with CSC instead\". At the time, CSC was sponsored by the French bike manufacturer Look, which is associated with Jalabert. The team also signed American Tyler Hamilton, formerly of U.S. Postal. The 2001 season was a breakthrough with Jalabert's win of the King of the Mountains competition and a stage on Bastille Day at the Tour de France. The season ended with Jalabert winning the 2001 Clásica de San Sebastián.\nIn 2002 Hamilton came second in the Giro d'Italia despite a broken scapula. The team also nearly won the team time trial at the 2002 Tour de France, thwarted by a flat tire. Jalabert again won the King of the Mountains and repeated his victory at the Clásica de San Sebastián. He retired at the end of the season.\nTeam CSC: 2003–2008.\nIn 2003, Riis changed Professional Cycling Denmark to Riis Cycling. Tiscali ceased sponsorship, and Riis Cycling was unable to find a new co-sponsor, hence the team changed CSC-Tiscali to Team CSC and continued 2003 on a reduced budget. The headquarters moved from Herning to the headquarters of one of the sponsors, the Danish insurance company Alm. Brand in Lyngby, a Copenhagen suburb.\nHamilton stepped up to be the team leader in 2003, with the goal of winning the Tour de France. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in form when he broke his collarbone in a pile-up on stage 1 of the Tour. He lost a lot of time. He made it up by winning a stage and finishing fourth, while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages.\nIn 2004 Hamilton switched to the Swiss team, Phonak, citing lack of support from Riis. The team brought on Ivan Basso from Fassa Bortolo to join Carlos Sastre in competing for Grand Tour wins. Basso had been a former winner of the maillot blanc in 2002. In the 2004 Tour de France, Team CSC had a very successful Tour, with Basso winning a mountain stage and reaching the podium in Paris with his third place finish. Bjarne Riis and Team CSCs efforts in the 2004 Tour were made into the cycling movie \"Overcoming\".\nFollowing an off-season marred by financial difficulties that resulted in wage cuts for a number of riders, the 2005 spring season was the strongest yet for CSC, with wins by Julich and Jens Voigt. Julich's victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leader's jersey in the new UCI ProTour. This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro d'Italia, one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso, though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by a stomach ailment.\nMidway through the 2005 Tour de France, CSC extended sponsorship until 2008 at a higher level, enabling Riis to renew the contract with Basso for an additional three years. Basso got second place in the tour and Zabriskie won in the prologue. Julich won the Eneco Tour and Carlos Sastre came second. Nicki Sørensen won a stage of the Vuelta a España. Team CSC won the 2005 ProTour, with Julich as the #8 ranked individual rider of the year, the highest placed rider in the team.\nUntil 2009, the team used Cervélo bikes and Shimano components. The arrangement with the small Canadian manufacturer worked well for CSC, as Cervélo's strength is time-trials, at which CSC has specialists.\n2006 season.\nIn 2006, with sponsorship for several years, the focus was to win all three Grand Tours, with Ivan Basso riding both Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, and Carlos Sastre the Vuelta a España. They had come second in the 2005 in the Tour and Vuelta, respectively. The team had several time trialists, including Zabriskie, who had won time trials at the Giro and the Tour, Julich, as well as Fabian Cancellara. Others included Jens Voigt and Stuart O'Grady from Australia, the only sprinter name in the team.\nThe first victory of the 2006 UCI ProTour season was in the prologue of Paris–Nice by Julich. The spring was plagued with injuries hitting a third of the team, most notably O'Grady. Cancellara won the time trial at Tirreno–Adriatico and then Paris–Roubaix. Fränk Schleck won the Amstel Gold Race a week later.\nTeam CSC surprised by announcing that Sastre would ride the Giro as helper for Basso, that he would ride all three Grand Tours. 2005's winner Paolo Savoldelli was strongest in the first stages, and Jan Ullrich took a surprise win in the time trial ahead of Basso, but Basso dominated with three wins on mountain finishes and in the team time trial. Basso won by 9'18\".\nOn 30 June 2006, the Tour de France announced that Basso would not ride the 2006 Tour after apparent involvement in the Operación Puerto doping scandal. Sastre took over as captain and was the strongest in the favorite group on the last mountain stages, but a poor last time trial placed him fourth overall. The team scored two stage wins, the most impressive Fränk Schleck's win on Alpe d'Huez. Voigt had already won a flat stage after a long break.\nThe autumn was dominated by the Basso's involvement in Operación Puerto. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent, and the case against Basso was eventually dropped by the Federazione Ciclistica Italiana for lack of evidence, but without him authorizing a DNA test that could have cleared him conclusively. Basso adamantly denied being involved. (On 7 May 2007 Basso admitted involvement in Operación Puerto). Team CSC have since started an ambitious anti-doping program together with the Danish anti-doping expert Rasmus Damsgaard. Meanwhile, on the road, Voigt dominated the Deutschland Tour, winning overall and three stages, including a mountain finish and a time trial. Sastre came fourth in the Vuelta after starting in the lead when CSC won the initial team time trial. It was Sastre's fifth Grand Tour in a row.\n2007 season.\nNew rider Juan José Haedo gave the team a good start by winning early minor races. The classics season was a success by having O'Grady win Paris–Roubaix. Voigt managed to defend his victory in Tour of Germany. CSC won the UCI ProTour team competition for the third year in a row.\nSastre had a team dedicated to him for the Vuelta, while the team for the Tour was support riders and riders who could make individual results. This left the Giro without a clear rider for the general classification. Instead a youthful team was chosen, with the hope that Andy Schleck might win the youth competition. He won the youth competition and came second overall .\nFor the Tour, Cancellara followed up a strong showing in the Tour de Suisse with two stage wins and seven days in the yellow jersey. But doping returned when the race hit the mountains. Alexander Vinokourov tested positive and leader Michael Rasmussen was withdrawn by his team for \"internal code violations\". Sastre finished fourth.\nFor the Vuelta, Sastre again lost time in time trials, especially the first, but climbed to second place.\nBecause of the team's link to drug use (Riis admitted doping, and Basso was suspended until 2008), MAN Trucks dropped co-sponsorship midway through 2007.\nCSC–Saxo Bank: 2008.\nCSC announced that they would not renew the contract in spring 2008, meaning Riis Cycling A/S would need a new main sponsor from 2009. Mid-June, Riis Cycling A/S announced that Saxo Bank had entered a three-year contract as name sponsor, with immediate effect, so the team entered the 2008 Tour de France as Team CSC Saxo Bank. Carlos Sastre, having taken a lead of about two minutes on the final climb of L'Alpe D'Huez, won the Tour, and the team took the team classification.\nTeam Saxo Bank: 2009–2010.\nIt was announced 28 September 2008 that for 2009, IT Factory would be co-sponsor. However, the company went into receivership some two months thereafter. The team also began riding Specialized bicycles for the 2009 season.\nSaxo Bank–SunGard: 2011.\nAlthough Saxo Bank had previously announced that 2010 would be the last year they would sponsor the team along with SunGard as secondary sponsor. The 2011 name for the team was announced in August 2010 as Team Saxo Bank–SunGard, and the signing of 2 time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador on a two-year contract was also revealed. On 29 July 2010, Andy Schleck and his brother Fränk announced their departure from the team effective from the start of the 2011 season.\nOn 16 November 2011 it was announced that SunGard would no longer be a title sponsor after 2011.\nSaxo–Tinkoff &amp; Tinkoff–Saxo: 2012.\n2012.\nOn 25 June 2012 it was announced that the Russian Tinkoff Bank would join the team as co-sponsors for the rest of the 2012 season and through to the end of 2013. Saxo Bank also renewed their sponsorship through 2013, with the team's name thus becoming Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank.\nAlberto Contador returned from his doping suspension and won the General classification of the 2012 Vuelta a España This marked the first overall Grand Tour win since Andy Schleck's retroactive victory of the 2010 Tour de France.\n2013.\nFollowing the 2013 season Oleg Tinkov purchased the team from manager Bjarne Riis with the team renamed Tinkoff-Saxo.\n2014.\nIn March, the team announced the signing of Colombian rider Edward Beltrán on a 2-year contract, Beltran was promoted from Tinkoff-Saxo's affiliate amateur team, Nankang–Fondriest,\n2015.\nFor the 2015 season the team announced the major signing of Peter Sagan on a three-year contract, as well as: Pavel Brutt, Ivan Basso. and Robert Kišerlovski.\nIn March 2015 the team confirmed that Riis had been removed from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. Later that month it was announced that Riis' contract had been terminated with the agreement of both parties. Subsequently the team revealed its new management structure, with Riis' former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh, who was promoted to the role of head sport director.\nIn a December 2015 interview, Tinkov announced that he would sell the team at the end of the 2016 season, citing on the one hand a business decision to redirect Tinkoff Bank's marketing budget from sports sponsorship to TV advertising from 2017, and on the other a lack of support from other teams from his proposed reforms to the sport's business model.\n2016.\nIn February 2016 Tinkov said that although he was \"happy to talk to any buyer\", he expected that the most likely outcome for the team would be its disbanding at the end of the year. However in July 2016 he said that he was planning to return to the sport after \"a few seasons off\", once Chris Froome retires from competition, with the aim of winning the Tour de France.\nNational, continental and world champions.\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2010\n2011\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016"

        "text": "Jack Edwin Hamilton (December 25, 1938 – February 22, 2018) was an American professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB), from –, for the Philadelphia Phillies, Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, California Angels, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox.\nProfessional career.\nOriginally signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a free agent, Hamilton debuted in MLB as a starting pitcher for the Phillies in 1962 and posted a 9–12 record with an earned run average of 5.09. Pitching for the Mets on May 4, 1966, Hamilton tossed a one-hitter against the Cardinals in St. Louis; the one hit being a bunt single by opposing pitcher Ray Sadecki. He showed more promise pitching out of the bullpen, and spent most of his career as a relief pitcher until his retirement in 1969, although he was converted back to a starting pitcher for the 1966 and 1967 seasons. In 1967, Hamilton was traded by the Mets to the Angels. \nTony Conigliaro beaning incident.\nOn August 18, the Angels were playing the Boston Red Sox in a game that would have important implications for the American League (AL) pennant race. While facing outfielder Tony Conigliaro, Hamilton hit him with a pitch on his left cheekbone that fractured both his cheekbone and eye socket, and severely damaged his retina. Conigliaro nearly died, and the damage to his vision kept him off the field the remainder of the year and all of 1968. Conigliaro made a promising-but-brief comeback in 1969–1970, until his vision problems returned, which eventually forced his early retirement from baseball in 1975 at age 30. \nHamilton retired in 1969, finishing his career with the White Sox.\nPersonal life.\nJack was born on December 25, 1938, in Morning Sun, Iowa, the son of Cecil and Myrtle Baird Hamilton. When Jack retired, he and his wife Jan got into the restaurant business opening eateries in various cities including his hometown of Morning Sun, IA. He and his wife moved to Branson in 1986 and he was owner of Jack &amp; Tommy’s and the Pzazz Restaurants. In Branson, Jack had a restaurant called Jack and Tommy’s. When that closed he started Pzazz which was in business for nearly 30 years. Pzazz was located in four different locations in Branson including Pointe Royale, and the top of the Plaza towers.”\nHamilton lived in Branson, Missouri, with his wife, Jan. Together, they had a son and two daughters. After his retirement from baseball, Hamilton owned and operated several restaurants in Iowa and Southwest Missouri. He died on February 22, 2018, at age 79."

Hulcy Middle School, and thereafter on to Dallas Carter High before transferring to Hillcrest High. Thomas grew up in Dallas, and after graduating from Dallas's Hillcrest High School, he attended Texas Christian University, where he led the NCAA Division I in scoring and rebounding in the 1994–95 season with 28.9 PPG and 14.6 RPG, becoming only the third player in history to accomplish this feat (the other two being Hank Gathers and Xavier McDaniel).\nNBA career.\nMiami Heat (1995-1997).\nThomas began his NBA career with the Miami Heat from 1995 to 1997. In his rookie season, he started 42 of his 74 games played. On December 10, 1995, he set a then career high with 29 points, along with grabbing 15 rebounds, in a loss to the Sacramento Kings. The following season, he only played 18 games before suffering a stress fracture in his right ankle, which required surgery. He would miss the rest of the season. During his rehab, Thomas, along with Sasha Danilović and Martin Müürsepp, were traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Jamal Mashburn.\nDallas Mavericks (1997-1998).\nThomas's playing career with Dallas was short. He only played 5 games before suffering another stress fracture in the same ankle he had previously injured. This placed him on the injured list for the remainder of the season. Then-coach and general manager Don Nelson went out of his way to hire Thomas as an assistant coach. In the offseason, Thomas decided to become a free agent, signing with the New York Knicks.\nNew York Knicks (1999–2005).\nThomas played seven seasons with the New York Knicks from 1999 to 2005, during which the team went to the playoffs four times, including two trips to the Eastern Conference Finals (1999 and 2000) and one trip to the NBA Finals (1999). On March 28, 1999, Thomas was disqualified, and later fined $5,000, for a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman during a 99-91 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. In the 2001 NBA Playoffs, Thomas averaged 14.4 points and 11.2 rebounds while starting all five games in a 2-3 first round series loss against the Toronto Raptors. His best personal success perhaps came in the 2001-02 NBA season, where he started all 82 regular season games and averaged 13.2 points and 9.1 rebounds a game. Also during this season, and the following, Thomas scored a career high 33 points, on March 17, 2002 and then on November 8, 2002.\nPhoenix Suns (2005–2007).\nThomas played two seasons with the Phoenix Suns from 2005 to 2007.\nSeattle SuperSonics (2007–2008).\nOn July 20, 2007, Thomas, along with the Suns' first-round draft choices in 2008 and 2010 (which became Serge Ibaka and Quincy Pondexter), was traded by the Suns to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for a conditional second-round draft choice and an $8 million trade exception.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2008–2009).\nThomas was traded by the Sonics to the San Antonio Spurs on February 20, 2008, for Francisco Elson, Brent Barry, and a 2009 first-round draft pick.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2009–2010).\nOn June 23, 2009, Thomas was traded along with Bruce Bowen and Fabricio Oberto to the Milwaukee Bucks for Richard Jefferson.\nChicago Bulls (2010–2011).\nOn July 26, 2010, the Chicago Bulls announced that they had signed Kurt Thomas. Because of injuries to the Bulls' starting center Joakim Noah and power forward Carlos Boozer, Kurt Thomas saw some significant playing time, including 37 starts. When Noah and Boozer came back, he experienced minimal playing time with Ömer Aşık playing in front of him on the bench. Although his playing time was slim during this span, Kurt Thomas won the appeal of Chicago fans with some emphatic highlights which were referred to as \"Turning back the Clock\" and eventually earned him the nickname \"Big Sexy\". Thomas averaged more than 20 minutes per game during the 2010-11 season along with 4.1 points and 5.8 rebounds.\nPortland Trail Blazers (2011–2012).\nOn December 11, 2011, the Portland Trail Blazers signed Thomas for the shortened 2011-2012 season. Though terms for the deal were not disclosed officially, it was reported to be a two-year contract.\nReturn to the Knicks (2012–2013).\nOn July 16, 2012, Thomas and Raymond Felton were traded to the New York Knicks for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, the rights to Kostas Papanikolaou and Giorgos Printezis, and a second round draft pick. On April 12, 2013, the Knicks waived Thomas."

        "title": "Antoine Wright (basketball)",
        "text": "Antoine Domonick Wright (born February 6, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player who last played for Rain or Shine Elasto Painters of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He attended preparatory school at Lawrence Academy at Groton; in 2002, he led the Spartans to an Independent School League Basketball Championship. After his junior year at Texas A&amp;M University, he was selected 15th overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the Nets, the highest pick from the Big 12 Conference that year and in Texas A&amp;M University history until Acie Law was drafted 11th in the 2007 NBA Draft. Wright played his first five seasons of professional basketball in the NBA. He has since played overseas and in the NBA D-League.\nEarly years.\nWright was born in West Covina, California to Wanda Wright. He attended the Lawrence Academy prep school in Groton, Massachusetts, where in his three seasons he started 115 games and amassed 1800 points, 500 rebounds, 350 assists, 170 steals and 200 blocked shots. His career single game highs were 50 points, 14 rebounds, and 8 assists.\nAs a sophomore (1999–2000), Wright averaged 20 points per game, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists, helping his school to a 15–12 record and earning him All-ISL and team MVP honors. The following year, his junior season, the team improved to a 23–2 record and Number 11 state ranking behind Wright's average 23.0 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. He was named MVP of the 2001 playoffs and earned All-ISL and All-Scholastic honors.\nIn his senior year, Wright, who averaged 26.5 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists, was again named the MVP of the playoffs and earning All-ISL and All-Scholastic rankings as his team reached a Number 7 state ranking. Wright was named the Number 1 prep shooting guard in the country by ESPN.com, who also ranked him the Number 4 overall prospect. He was also named third-team Parade All-American. He was also dismissed from the High School months before graduating for disciplinary reasons.\nWright joined the USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team in 2002, with the team earning a bronze medal for their 4–1 record; Wright averaged 6.8 points per game, 4.4 rebounds per game, and a team second best 2.4 steals per game. The medal qualified the team for a berth in the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championships. He recorded tournaments bests of 10 points in the USA's preliminary round victory over the Dominican Republic and seven rebounds in their semifinal loss to Venezuela.\nWright was heavily recruited, entertaining scholarship offers from schools including Arizona, Maryland, Connecticut, UNC, Texas and Arizona State University. He chose to attend Texas A&amp;M University and play under coach Melvin Watkins, primarily to show his loyalty to the coaching staff who had noticed him long before the other schools began wooing him.\nTexas A&amp;M University.\nFreshman year (2002-2003).\nAntoine Wright had a phenomenal season in his first year at Texas A&amp;M University, becoming the consensus Big 12 Conference Freshman of the year. Leading the Aggies with 6.6 rebounds per game, .7 blocks per game, 1.3 steals per game, and 2.3 three-pointers made per game, Wright's 14.5 points per game made him the second-highest scorer on the team, and one of only five freshmen in the nation to average 14.0 points and 6 rebounds. He had eight games where he scored more than 20 points, and 10 additional games where he scored 10 or more points. He scored a season-high 25 points in games against Miami and Texas. His best game, however, came against Kansas State University, in which he scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds.\nSophomore year (2003-2004).\nDespite a tough year for the Aggies, who lost all 16 of their conference games, Wright who started in 26 of the 28 games in which he played, was named an Honorable Mention All-Big 12 player. He led the Aggies in scoring (13.5 points per game), three-point field goals (47) and blocked shots (98). Against Grambling, Wright scored a career-high 32 points, including 5 3-pointers. He recorded a career-high 12 rebounds against Kansas while also scoring 24 points. In the Big 12 Tournament, he scored 22 points in a game against Missouri.\nAfter Coach Watkins was pressured to resign during the Big 12 Tournament, Wright seriously considered transferring to a different school or entering the draft early. He met with new coach Billy Gillispie, who told him that he needed one great year to become a first round draft pick, and vowed to help Wright attain that goal. Wright was still not completely convinced, until, after returning late from a weekend trip to Atlanta, Georgia, Gillispie suspended him for breaking the rules. As he watched his teammates complete their off-season workouts without him, he noticed that the players were beginning to look tougher and better, and Wright decided to stay and join them.\nJunior year (2004-2005).\nAs a junior, Wright ranked fourth in the Big 12 in scoring, with 17.8 points per game, and led the league in three-point completion percentage (.447). His 36 steals were a team high, and he blocked 22 shots, second only to Joseph Jones for the Aggies. He tied his career-high 32 points in a game against Colorado, including making all 11 of his free-throw attempts. Against Texas Tech he scored 29 points, converting 7 of his 8 three-point attempts. These accomplishments made him the first Aggie to be named to First Team All-Big 12 by the Associated Press.\nWith Wright's assistance, under new coach Gillispie the team exhibited a dramatic turnaround, earning an invitation to the NIT. The team made it to the NIT quarterfinals, their best postseason performance since 1982, when they lost in the NIT quarterfinals. Wright scored 21 points on 7-for-12 shooting in their quarterfinal loss to St. Joseph's.\nAggie legacy.\nWright chose to leave the Aggies after his junior year to join the 2005 NBA draft. His 1,338 career points rank tenth on the Texas A&amp;M all-time leading scorer list, while his 181 three-point field goals place him second, and his 50 blocks put him in 11th place of all Aggie basketball players.\nAlthough Wright was projected before the draft as a consensus top 12 pick, the New Jersey Nets actually selected him as the 15th overall pick, making him the third Aggie draft pick in 29 years. This was the first time an Aggie had been taken in the first round of the NBA draft since Sonny Parker in 1976 and also set the mark for the highest an Aggie had ever been drafted, beating Parker's 17th pick. That record would be broken two years later when the Atlanta Hawks drafted Acie Law with the 11th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft\nNBA career.\nNew Jersey Nets.\nDuring his first season as a professional basketball player, Wright played in thirty-nine games for the Nets, averaging 1.8 points, 0.8 rebounds, 0.3 assists, and 9.5 minutes per game. He was forced to sit out the beginning of the season on the inactive list, but began gaining minutes as the season progressed, eventually becoming part of the rotation. Although Wright was drafted for his jump shot, he shot only 35% from the field.\nWright's 2006–07 season began much better, as he became a big part of coach Lawrence Frank's rotation. After starter Richard Jefferson injured his ankle against the Miami Heat, Wright took his place in the starting lineup. He was averaging 28.2 minutes per game and chipping in 8.5 points per game, and 4.5 rebounds per game off the bench.\nAn ankle injury caused Wright to miss eight games in the 2007–08 season.\nDallas Mavericks.\nWright was part of a trade that sent Jason Kidd, Malik Allen, and himself to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Devin Harris, DeSagana Diop, Trenton Hassell, Maurice Ager, Keith Van Horn and future draft picks.\nHe scored a career-high of 24 points over 39 minutes in the 109–106 victory against the Indiana Pacers on November 25, 2008.\nToronto Raptors.\nThe Toronto Raptors acquired Antoine Wright and Devean George from the Dallas Mavericks and a sign and trade for Hedo Türkoğlu from the Orlando Magic on July 9, 2009. It was a four-way deal sending Jerry Stackhouse (who was bought out and released immediately) and substantial cash from Dallas to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Dallas Mavericks received Shawn Marion and Kris Humphries along with Nathan Jawai from the Toronto Raptors, and the Orlando Magic got a trade exception.\nSacramento Kings.\nOn July 23, 2010 Antoine signed by the Sacramento Kings. However, after 7 games, on November 29, 2010 was waived by the Kings.\nPost career.\nIn 2021, he was charged along with seventeen former players in a fraud case involving trying to bilk the NBA's Health and Welfare Benefit Plan out of nearly $4 million. \nInternational career.\nJiangsu Dragons.\nOn December 31, 2010, he signed with the Chinese team Jiangsu Dragons.\nClub Baloncesto Estudiantes.\nOn August 9, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with the Spanish team Club Baloncesto Estudiantes.\nGuaiqueries de Margarita.\nOn April 26, 2012, Wright signed with Guaiqueries de Margarita of the LPB of Venezuela.\nAmeriLeague.\nOn October 6, 2015, Wright signed with the upcoming AmeriLeague to play on the following season. However, the league folded after it was discovered the founder was a con-artist.\nRain or Shine Elasto Painters.\nOn February 20, 2016, Wright was announced by the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters to be the team's new import for the 2016 PBA Commissioner's Cup, replacing an injured Wayne Chism. However, on March 9, 2016, Wright was released by the Elasto Painters after under-performing for the team, leading the team to a 1–3 win–loss record during his 4 games with the club."

Anderson was named Big Ten Pitcher of the Year in .\nAnderson was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft and signed by scout Steve Lemke. In the season, he became the first player from the Staten Island Yankees to become a New York Yankee. (Wily Mo Peña was the first Staten Island alum to make it to the majors, but he did it with the Cincinnati Reds.) The \"Baby Bombers\" retired Anderson's #19 on July 14, 2003, in tribute. That day was also proclaimed \"Jason Anderson Day\" in Staten Island. Anderson earned his first major league win that year in 22 appearances with the Yankees, but midway through the year, he was traded to the New York Mets in a deal that brought Armando Benítez to the Yankees.\nIn the season, Anderson was designated for assignment by the Mets, and the Cleveland Indians claimed him off waivers. He only pitched one inning for the team all year, giving up five runs, and in the next year, he rejoined the Yankees, making the major league roster after Paul Quantrill and Mike Stanton were designated for assignment.\nThe San Diego Padres claimed Anderson off waivers from the Yankees on February 15, .

        "text": "The PGA Grand Slam of Golf was an annual off-season golf tournament contested from 1979 until 2014 when the tournament was cancelled. It was contested by the year's winners of the four major championships of regular men's golf, which are the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship. It was one of several invitational events for leading male golfers held each year after the PGA Tour and the European Tour seasons had concluded. The competition was organized by the PGA of America and the prize money did not count toward the PGA Tour money list.\nThe tournament was staged since 1979 with a couple of short breaks. Beginning in 1991, it was played as a two-day, 36-hole stroke play competition, except in 1998 and 1999, when it was played at match play. From 1979 to 1990, it was played as a one-day, 18-hole stroke play competition. If a player won more than one major in a calendar year or a player declined the invitation to play, the PGA of America filled the four-man field by inviting the former major winner(s) with the best overall finishes in that year's majors.\nInitially the PGA Grand Slam of Golf was played at a different golf course each year, but from 1994 to 2006, it was played at the Poipu Bay Golf Course in Koloa, Hawaii on the island of Kauai. The tournament in Hawaii allowed the event to be televised in prime-time American television with live coverage because of the time difference.\nIn 2007, the tournament moved to the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda and it was played in mid-October, reflecting the earlier end to the main part of the PGA Tour season after the introduction of the FedEx Cup. In 2009, the event stayed in Bermuda but moved to the Port Royal Golf Course.\nThe final prize fund was $1.35 million, of which $600,000 went to the winner. This was the lowest first prize some of the competitors had played for all year, but on the other hand there was a guaranteed $200,000 for coming in last. From 1991 to 2005, the prize fund was $1 million, of which $400,000 went to the winner. In 2006, the purse was $1.25 million, with $500,000 going to the winner.\nIn the 2004 tournament at Poipu Bay Golf Course, Phil Mickelson shot a 59 in the second round.\nThe 1986–90 tournaments were played at Kemper Lakes Golf Club in Hawthorn Woods, Illinois, site of the PGA Championship in 1989.\nThe event was to be moved to Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California for the 2015 contest, but on July 7, 2015 the PGA announced that the 2015 event will not be played at the course due to outcry over comments that course owner Donald Trump made about Latino immigrants. After being unable to find a suitable replacement venue, the 2015 event was canceled.\nIn March 2016, the event was discontinued altogether after the PGA of America concluded it no longer fit in \"today's golf landscape.\"\nWorld Series of Golf.\nThe year's four major champions in a 36-hole event was previously applied at the original \"World Series of Golf,\" played from 1962 through 1975 at the South Course of Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. Held in early September, Jack Nicklaus won four of the fourteen events, including the first two, and was runner-up in six. All editions had a winner's share of $50,000, a substantial prize in its early years, significantly more than a major. The event changed to a limited field PGA Tour event in 1976 and continues as the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.\nResults.\n\"Note: a=alternate\"&lt;br&gt;\nb=Mike Ditka replaced Curtis Strange due to illness.\nMultiple winners.\nFive golfers have won the event more than once:"

        "text": "Matthew Garrett McCoy (born October 14, 1982) is a former American football linebacker. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at San Diego State.\nMcCoy has also played for the New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks.\nEarly years.\nMcCoy attended Tustin High School in Tustin, California. He set the school record for quarterback sacks with 18.5 sacks as a junior. As a senior, he broke his own record with 23 sacks and was named \"High School Defensive Player of the Year\" by the Orange County Register.\nCollege career.\nMcCoy played college football at San Diego State University where he won All-Mountain West Conference honors. He finished his career with eight sacks, 270 tackles (26.5 for losses), four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, four pass deflections, and a blocked kick.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nMcCoy was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft as a project linebacker whom Eagles personnel felt they could develop. McCoy was expected to contribute to special teams, but did not contribute in his rookie season. Going into 2006, he was named the weakside linebacker starter by Defensive Coordinator Jim Johnson. Initially he had been praised as having great speed, sideline to sideline pursuit abilities and a high motor, as well as described as a \"ball hawk\". He had an injured shoulder later in the year that prevented him from playing as well as he had during the first 6 weeks of the season, and ultimately led to his benching in favor of rookie Omar Gaither. Matt McCoy finished the season with 66 tackles, 2 sacks, 3 forces fumbles, and 5 tackles for loss.\nAt the beginning of the 2007 season, McCoy was listed as a back-up linebacker and a starter on special team kickoffs. In the team's Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, McCoy was flagged for unnecessary roughness after a late hit on punter Chris Kluwe. The following day, he was cut in favor of practice squad linebacker Akeem Jordan. When asked about the penalty's effect on the transaction, head coach Andy Reid said Jordan was more the reason for the move.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nAfter being let go by the Eagles, McCoy was signed by the New Orleans Saints on November 3, 2007. He appeared in four games with the team, recording two solo tackles.\nMcCoy was not tendered a contract by the team as a restricted free agent the following off-season, making him an unrestricted free agent.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn March 4, 2008, McCoy signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nAfter being inactive for the 2009 regular season opener, McCoy recorded one tackle against the Buffalo Bills on September 20. He was released by the Buccaneers on September 26 when wide receiver Mario Urrutia was promoted from the practice squad. He was re-signed on September 29, when Urrutia was waived. McCoy was released again on October 13, to make room for newly signed wide receiver Yamon Figurs. He was re-signed on November 11.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn March 16, 2010, McCoy signed with the Seattle Seahawks."

        "title": "Steve Fisher (basketball)",
        "text": "Stephen Louis Fisher (born March 24, 1945) is an American former basketball coach. Fisher served as the head coach for the Michigan Wolverines, with whom he won the national championship in 1989, and was an assistant at Michigan, Western Michigan University, and the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association. From 1999 to 2017, Fisher was head coach for the San Diego State Aztecs.\nFisher attended Illinois State University, where he was a reserve guard on the Redbirds team that advanced to the Final Four of the 1967 NCAA College Division basketball tournament.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nFisher moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1982 and took an assistant coaching job at the University of Michigan after having served as an assistant coach at Western Michigan University since 1979. In 1989, during the final week of the regular season, Michigan head coach Bill Frieder agreed to take the coaching job at Arizona State University beginning the next season. Frieder intended to coach Michigan through the end of the 1989 NCAA tournament. However, when he told athletic director Bo Schembechler of his intentions, Schembechler ordered Frieder to leave immediately and named Fisher as interim head coach. When announcing the promotion of Fisher, Schembechler famously said, \"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team. A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan.\"\nInitially, Fisher was not expected to retain the position after the season. However, Fisher led the Wolverines to an improbable NCAA championship that season, thanks to a strong performance by forward Glen Rice. Schembechler hired him as the school's permanent head coach a week after the championship game. Fisher hired Brian Dutcher as Assistant Head Coach. Michigan credits the 1988–89 regular season to Frieder and the NCAA tournament to Fisher. Because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the timing of Fisher's hiring, he is the only person to win the NCAA Men's Division I national championship without having ever experienced a loss as the team's head coach.\nThe next two seasons of the Fisher era were struggles. However, in 1991, Fisher signed one of the most talented incoming freshman classes of all time. High school stars Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Ray Jackson, Jimmy King, and Juwan Howard all signed with Fisher and Michigan, forming what became known as the \"Fab Five\". Together, they helped lead the Wolverines to the national title game in their freshman year, only to lose to Duke. As sophomores, they again reached the title game, this time losing to North Carolina. In that game, Webber was called for a technical foul with 11 seconds remaining in the game when he signaled for a timeout when the Wolverines had none left.\nAfter the title-game loss to the Tar Heels, Webber went pro; Rose and Howard followed after an elite eight loss to the eventual National Champion Arkansas Razorbacks. The Wolverines would not reach the same heights until 2013, although they reached the postseason each of the next five seasons and won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament.\nIn October 1997, Michigan fired Fisher as a result of an off-court scandal (\"see section below\").\nFisher was out of coaching for the 1997–98 season before taking a job as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings.\nIn 1999, Fisher took over as coach of a San Diego State program and brought Brian Dutcher with him. The school had suffered losing records in 13 of the previous 14 years. In the season before he arrived, the Aztecs had won just four games, but within two seasons Fisher had brought the team up to a .500 record, and led them to a 21–12 record and an NCAA Tournament appearance in year three of his regime. He has since led them to seven other NCAA tourneys, and five appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\nEd Martin scandal.\nIn 1997, after it was revealed that Maurice Taylor had visited Ed Martin, a retired Ford electrician and University of Michigan booster, the school launched an investigation. After the investigators questioned Fisher's role in arranging complimentary tickets for Martin, Fisher was fired a week before practice began for the 1997–98 season.\nLater, additional facts surfaced that further damaged the program's reputation. In 2002, an indictment unsealed in a Detroit federal court charged Ed Martin with running an illegal gambling operation and money laundering. Additionally, it claimed that Martin gave Webber $280,000 in illicit loans while Webber was in high school and college, with another $336,000 allegedly going to three other former Wolverine players – Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock. Martin ultimately pleaded guilty, but died in February 2003.\nAs a result of the revelations, Michigan imposed its own sanctions on the basketball program in 2002, vacating its two Final Four games from the 1992 NCAA Tournament and its standing as the tournament's runner-up. It also vacated the entire 1992–93 season, as well as every game from 1995–96 to 1998–99. Michigan also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002–03 season, and removed the banners hanging in Crisler Arena that commemorated their post-season appearances and removed references to the named players' records. The move came because the payments may have compromised the four players' amateur status. The NCAA accepted Michigan's sanctions, and additionally placed the school on probation until 2006. It also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from the four players until 2013.\nThe discoveries did not impact Fisher's career with San Diego State (and no new allegations have occurred in conjunction with that program). Fisher denied any knowledge of the Martin misconduct. The NCAA ultimately faulted Fisher for allowing Martin access to his players (though his ties to Michigan dated to the Frieder era), but otherwise cleared him of wrongdoing.\nSan Diego State.\nIn 1999, Fisher took over the basketball program at San Diego State University. The Aztecs had not been to the postseason since their NCAA appearance in 1985.\nIn his third year, Fisher led the Aztecs to their first Mountain West Conference tournament title, and finished with a 21–12 record and continued the upward surge of the program. They returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since that 1984–1985 team. During the 2002–2003 season (his fourth year), Fisher's Aztecs returned to the postseason when they hosted an NIT first-round game against UCSB. The Aztecs earned their first ever Division I postseason win. After two rebuilding seasons (2003–2004 and 2004–2005), the Aztecs returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2005–2006, Fisher's seventh season. That year, the Aztecs began a 10-year streak of 20+ win seasons while capturing their first ever Mountain West Conference regular season championship, and winning their second Mountain West Conference tournament championship.\nIn 2009, the Aztecs earned a school-record 26 victories and reached the semifinals of the NIT. It was their third consecutive trip to the NIT, and fourth consecutive postseason appearance. In the 2009–2010 season, the Aztecs won another 20+ games and the Mountain West tournament, earning their third NCAA tournament berth under Fisher. In 2010–2011, the Aztecs, ranked #25 in the preseason AP poll and were ranked #4 late in the season, the highest ranking in school history. The Aztecs received three first-place votes in the coaches' poll at one point, spending nearly the entire season in the top 10 and winning their first-ever NCAA tournament game en route to a Sweet 16 berth. They set a school record in the 2010–11 season with 34 wins. That said, they had only three losses, the first two against Sweet-16 team BYU (whom they beat in MWC tournament championship game) and their third to eventual NCAA champion UConn.\nOverall Fisher has guided SDSU to the NCAA Tournament in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and the postseason NIT in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2016 to go along with twelve 20-win seasons (eleven consecutive from 2005–present). Additionally, under Fisher, the Aztecs have won or shared six MWC regular season titles (2006 outright, 2011 shared with BYU, 2012 shared with New Mexico, 2014 outright, 2015 shared with Boise State, 2016 outright), and won four MWC tournaments (2002, 2006, 2010, 2011). Since the 2005–2006 season, Steve Fisher has led the Aztecs to eleven consecutive post-season appearances, including six consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances—the first time the Aztecs have done this as a Division I team.\nJust ten head coaches have won the NIT as well as the NCAA tournaments. The others are Nat Holman (who did it in the same year), John Calipari, Vadal Peterson, Nolan Richardson, Bobby Knight, Adolph Rupp, Joe B. Hall, Al McGuire, Dean Smith, and Jim Calhoun.\nSteve Fisher won his 300th game as SDSU head coach on January 31, 2014, against Colorado State University.\nOn October 29, 2015, SDSU dedicated the basketball court at Viejas Arena to Fisher, naming it Steve Fisher Court.\nOn April 10, 2017, Fisher reportedly informed SDSU of his intent to retire, which was followed by a formal announcement the following day that confirmed his retirement.\nHead coaching record.\n^\"Michigan vacated its two 1992 Final Four games and its status as tournament runner-up. Official record is 24–8.\"\n^^\"Entire season, including postseason tournament appearances, later vacated by the school.\"\n\"Michigan total record includes games subsequently vacated by the school.\""

        "title": "Baseball scorekeeping",
        "text": "Baseball scorekeeping is the practice of recording the details of a baseball game as it unfolds. Professional baseball leagues hire official scorers to keep an official record of each game (from which a box score can be generated), but many fans keep score as well for their own enjoyment. Scorekeeping is usually done on a printed scorecard and, while official scorers must adhere precisely to one of the few different scorekeeping notations, most fans exercise some amount of creativity and adopt their own symbols and styles.\nHistory.\nSportswriter Henry Chadwick is generally credited as the inventor of baseball scorekeeping. His basic scorecard and notation have evolved significantly since their advent in the 1870s but they remain the basis for most of what has followed.\nAbbreviations and grammar.\nSome symbols and abbreviations are shared by nearly all scorekeeping systems. For example, the position of each player is indicated by a number:\nThe designated hitter (DH), if used, is marked using a zero (0).\nScorecards.\nScorecards vary in appearance but almost all share some basic features, including areas for:\nUsually two scorecards (one for each team) are used to score a game.\nTraditional scorekeeping.\nThere is no authoritative set of rules for scorekeeping. The traditional method has many variations in its symbols and syntax, but this is a typical example.\nIn the traditional method, each cell in the main area of the scoresheet represents the \"lifetime\" of an offensive player, from at-bat, to baserunner, to being put out, scoring a run, or being left on base.\nOuts.\nWhen an out is recorded, the combination of defensive players executing that out is recorded. For example:\nReaching base.\nIf a batter reaches first base, either due to a walk, a hit, or an error, the basepath from home to first base is drawn, and the method described in the lower-righthand corner. For example:\nAdvancing.\nWhen a runner advances due to a following batter, it can be noted by the batting position or the uniform number of the batter that advanced the runner. This kind of information is not always included by amateur scorers, and there is a lot of variation in notation. For example:\nExample.\nThe scorecard on the right describes the August 8, 2000 game between the Milwaukee Brewers and San Francisco Giants, played at Pacific Bell Park, in San Francisco. The scorecard describes the following events in the top of the 1st inning:\nOne hard and fast rule of baseball scorekeeping is that \"every\" out and \"every\" time a baserunner advances \"must\" be recorded. The scoring can get a little more complicated when a batter who has reached base, is then \"moved up\" (advances one or more bases) by his own actions or by the actions of a hitter behind him. This is demonstrated in the Giants' first inning:\nStranded baserunners might be notated as being \"LOB\" (Left On Base) for that inning, with a number from 1-3 likely at the bottom of the inning column. For example, if two runners are left on base after the 3rd out, the scorekeeper might note \"LOB:2\", then at the end of the game calculate a total number of LOB for the game.\nA more complicated example of scorekeeping is the record of the bottom of the 5th inning:\nProject Scoresheet.\nProject Scoresheet was an organization run by volunteers in the 1980s for the purpose of collecting baseball game data and making it freely available to the public (the data collected by Major League Baseball was and still is not freely available). To collect and distribute the data, Project Scoresheet needed a method of keeping score that could be easily input to a computer. This limited the language to letters, numbers, and punctuation (no baseball diamonds or other symbols not found on a computer keyboard).\nScorecard.\nIn addition to the new language introduced by Project Scoresheet, a few major changes were made to the traditional scorecard. First, innings of play are not recorded in a one-per-column fashion; instead all boxes are used sequentially and new innings are indicated with a heavy horizontal line. This saves considerable space on the card (since no boxes are left blank) and reduces the likelihood of a game requiring a second set of scorecards.\nThe second major change is the detailed offensive and defensive in/out system, which allows the scorekeeper to specify very specifically when players enter and leave the game. This is vital for attributing events to the proper players.\nLastly, each \"event box\" on a Project Scoresheet scorecard is broken down into three sections: before the play, during the play, and after the play. All events are put into one of these three slots. For example, a stolen base happens \"before the play\" because it occurs before the batter's at-bat is over. A hit is considered \"during the play\" because it ends the batter's plate appearance, and baserunner movement subsequent to the batter's activity is considered \"after the play\".\nLanguage.\nThe language developed by Project Scoresheet can be used to record trajectories and locations of batted balls and every defensive player who touched the ball, in addition to the basic information recorded by the traditional method. Here are some examples:\nIn the \"before the play\" slot:\nIn \"during the play\" slot:\nIn the \"after the play\" slot:\nReisner Scorekeeping.\nProject Scoresheet addressed a lack of precision in the traditional scorekeeping method, and introduced several new features to the scorecard. But while the Project Scoresheet language continues to be the baseball research community's standard for storing play-by-play game data in computers, the scorecards it yields are difficult to read due to the backtracking required to reconstruct a mid-inning play. Hence, despite its historical importance, the system has never gained favor with casual fans.\nIn 2002 Alex Reisner developed a new scorekeeping method that took the language of Project Scoresheet but redefined the way the event boxes on the scorecard worked, virtually eliminating the backtracking required by both Project Scoresheet and the traditional method. The system also makes it easy to reconstruct any mid-inning situation, a difficult task with the other two systems (for this reason it was originally promoted as \"Situational Scorekeeping\").\nScorecard.\nA Reisner scorecard looks like a cross between a traditional and Project Scoresheet scorecard. It has a diamond (representing the field, as in the traditional system) and a single line for recording action during and after the play (like Project Scoresheet's second and third lines). The diamond in each event box is used to show which bases are occupied by which players at the start of an at-bat. Stolen bases, pickoffs, and other \"before the play\" events are also marked on the diamond, so that one can see the \"situation\" in which an at-bat took place by simply glancing at the scorecard.\nComputer Generated Scorecards.\nWith the advent of online baseball event application programming interface feeds, it is now possible to have software generate and update a scorecard in real-time. Such scorecards can include a level of detail and precision which would not be practical for a human keeping score manually. "

While at Auburn, Mitchell was a four-time All-SEC selection and was named a second-team All-American in his 1977–78 season. He also became Auburn's all-time leader in scoring (2,123 points) and rebounding (996), after leaving for the NBA. He remains the all-time leading rebounder and is second in all-time scoring only to Chuck Person. Mitchell's number 30 jersey was retired on January 19, 2013, at the Auburn Arena.\nProfessional career.\nMitchell was drafted with the 15th pick in the first round, of the 1978 NBA draft, by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He started his NBA career with the Cavaliers but played most of his career for the San Antonio Spurs. Mitchell was a 6'7\" and 234 lb. small forward, with career averages of 19.8 points per game, 5.6 rebounds per game, 1.3 assists per game, a .493 field goal percentage, and a .779 free throw percentage. He was known for his mid-range jumpshot and ability to play well under pressure in the postseason.\nMitchell was an All-Star in 1981 and was in the top ten in scoring four times, and the top ten in minutes played three times. During the 1983 NBA Playoffs, Mitchell and the Spurs reached the Western Conference Finals, where Mitchell led the Spurs in scoring with 25.7 points a game, while adding 10.3 rebounds a game, as the Spurs were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Among other career highlights, he led the Spurs in scoring for the 1984–1985 season, which marked the only season in which George Gervin played on the Spurs and did not lead the team in scoring over an entire year. Mitchell averaged 22.2 points per game, to Gervin's 21.2 per game.\nMitchell averaged 19.8 points per game over the course of his NBA career. His 9,799 total points scored for the San Antonio Spurs is seventh highest in franchise history, behind Gervin, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Tony Parker, James Silas, and Manu Ginóbili.\nFrom 1988, until a short return to the Spurs during the 1990 playoffs, Mitchell played in Italy, with Basket Brescia.

        "text": "David Cash Jr. (born June 11, 1948) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from 1969 to 1980, most prominently as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates where, he was a member of the 1971 World Series winning team and, with the Philadelphia Phillies where he became a three-time All-Star player. He also played for the Montreal Expos and the San Diego Padres. After his playing career, Cash spent several years as a minor league hitting coach and manager for several major league organizations.\nCareer.\nCash was born in Utica, New York and attended Thomas R. Proctor High School. His MLB career started modestly, as he played in only 82 games over his first two seasons, though he still hit a very respectable .306 in 271 at-bats. Cash established himself as a solid singles hitter and a good defensive second baseman in his time in Pittsburgh. He was the Pirates' primary second baseman from 1971 to 1973, but his playing time was reduced somewhat by military service commitments and by the presence on the team of veteran second baseman Bill Mazeroski and rising star Rennie Stennett. After the 1973 season, with Stennett ready to play regularly and another excellent young second baseman (Willie Randolph) in their minor league system, the Pirates traded Cash to the Phillies for pitcher Ken Brett.\nWith the Phillies from 1974 to 1976, Cash became a true everyday player, missing only two games over three seasons. He made the All-Star team each year, and batted .300 or better with over 200 hits in both 1974 and 1975.\nAfter the 1976 season, Cash signed as a free agent with the Expos. He had a good season in 1977 but a disappointing year in 1978, and by 1979 had lost his job as the Expos' starting second baseman. He finished his career as a part-time player with the Padres in 1980.\nCoaching.\nIn 2006, Cash was hired to be first base coach for the Baltimore Orioles.\nIn 2007, he was hired to be the Manager of the Utica Brewmasters in the New York State League established in 2007 in his hometown of Utica, New York. During the team's first game ever, Cash was ejected by the homeplate umpire for arguing balls and strikes.\nIn 2008, Cash was hired as the hitting coach for the Sussex Skyhawks in the CAN-AM League.

        "title": "Australia women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Australian women's national cricket team (formerly also known as the Southern Stars) represent Australia in international women's cricket. Currently captained by Alyssa Healy and coached by Shelley Nitschke, they are the top team in all world rankings assigned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the women's game.\nAustralia played their first Test match in 1934–35 against England. The two teams now compete biennially for the Women's Ashes. A rich history with New Zealand stretches back almost as far while strong rivalries have also developed more recently with India and the West Indies, manifesting predominantly via limited overs cricket. In the 50-over format of the game, Australia have won more World Cups than all other teams combined—capturing the 1978, 1982, 1988, 1997, 2005, 2013 and 2022 titles. They have achieved similarly emphatic success in Twenty20 cricket by winning the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020 and 2023.\nIn 2003, Women's Cricket Australia (WCA) and the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) merged to form a single governing body, known as Cricket Australia (CA), which remains to this day. CA has expressed a major goal of the organisation is for cricket to be Australia's leading sport for women and girls, citing the performance and exposure of the national team—which is heavily dependent on its increasingly professional domestic structures, namely the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) and the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL)—as a key factor to achieving such an aspiration.\nA survey conducted by TrueNorth Research in April 2020 showed the national women's cricket team have the strongest emotional connection with Australian sports fans.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nOrganised cricket has been played by women in Australia since no later than 1874 when the first recorded match took place in Bendigo. Competitions have existed at state level since the early-1900s and at national level since 1931–32. The Australian Women's Cricket Council (AWCC) was formed in March 1931 to administer and develop the game at the national level. The original members of the AWCC were Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. South Australia and Western Australia joined in 1934, while ACT and Tasmania affiliated in 1977 and 1982 respectively.\nEngland became the first international women's cricket team to visit Australia, touring in the summer of 1934–35 to compete in a series against an Australian team captained by Margaret Peden. Three Test matches—the first-ever involving women—were played during the series which received significant public and media interest. Men, in particular, were eager and curious to see the women play. The famous SCG barracker Yabba was quoted at the time: \"The ladies are playing alright for me. This is cricket, this is… Leave the girls alone!\" Following two losses, Australia eked out a draw in the third Test at the MCG with the spin bowling duo of Anne Palmer and Peggy Antonio proving to be among the team's standout performers.\nAfter raising their own funds to travel to the United Kingdom, the Australian women's team embarked on a maiden overseas voyage in 1937. They proceeded to play 16 tour matches across England including three Tests—the first resulting in a narrow win which saw leg spinner Peggy Antonio dominate with the ball again while Kath Smith played a crucial all-round role. With the series level at 1–1, the third Test was played at The Oval and attracted a crowd of over 6,000 people. The match ended in a draw. Soon after Australia's landmark tour, the momentum of the burgeoning women's game was halted by the events of World War II.\n1947–1958: Wilson era.\nInternational cricket resumed toward the end of the 1947–48 season when Australia visited New Zealand for the first time, comprehensively defeating the hosts in the only Test of the tour. The following summer, England returned to Australian shores and suffered their first series loss. Having already affirmed herself as a star of the team with a ten-wicket haul and an innings of 90 against New Zealand, all-rounder Betty Wilson led Australia to a 186-run victory in the first Test of the 1948–49 series over England, claiming match figures of 9/62 as well as scoring a century.\nAustralia's 1951 tour of England included one of the closest finishes to a women's Test match in the 20th century. The second Test, played in Worcester, was a tight battle as the Mollie Dive-led Australian team overcame a 39-run first innings deficit to successfully chase down a target of 160 on the final day of play with two wickets in hand. Though Wilson contributed key runs and wickets as anticipated, it was ultimately the all-round performance of fast bowler Norma Whiteman (who finished the match with a defiant knock of 36 not out) which guided the team across the line. Both players were also standouts in the Third test, though England nevertheless triumphed by 137 runs to end the three-match series at 1–1.\nEngland's next tour of Australia produced several notable milestones, particularly during the first Test of the drawn 1957–58 series. The match, played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne, marked the first time international cricket was broadcast on Australian television. Betty Wilson was once again an inimitable force throughout the topsy-turvy contest, which ultimately ended in a draw, becoming the first player to take ten wickets and score a century in the same Test. In another historic breakthrough, Faith Thomas made her debut in the match, becoming the first Indigenous person to represent Australia in any national sporting team.\n1958–1973: Establishment of the IWCC.\nAustralia became a member of the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) at its inception in 1958, helping to form the governing body alongside England, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Africa. Lack of funds and low public interest throughout the 1960s caused the women's game, once again, to decline. The on-field fortunes of the Australian team were simultaneously grim, as they finished the decade with a streak of eleven winless Test matches.\nSuccess continued to elude Australia throughout the early-1970s, culminating in their first-ever Test mach loss to New Zealand. However, the broader development and support of women's cricket began to soar once more due to the pivotal roles of a handful of dedicated players and administrators, especially through their efforts in schools and junior clubs. Among the devoted contributors was Mary Allitt, who captained the national team for the 1963 tour of England and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in June 2007. Upon her passing in 2013, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said Allitt helped to \"pave the way for today's elite players\" and that she \"holds a significant place in the history of women's cricket.\"\nOne of the longest-serving players and administrators for women's cricket during this period was Lorna Thomas. Retiring as a cricketer in the late 1950s, Thomas took up team management which included overseeing four tours abroad. After almost a lifetime's involvement with the game, she retired from her position as manager of the New South Wales and Australian teams in the 1970s and was awarded an MBE for services to cricket.\n1973–1991: Introduction of One Day cricket.\nThe team attracted sponsors with the help of the first World Cup in 1973, which served as an introduction to the One Day International (ODI) format for women's cricket. Australia finished the tournament as runners-up, losing to host nation England in the final. The number of tours, both overseas and at home, increased soon thereafter. Healthy finances allowed for investment in more suitable training and coaching, and these initiatives were vindicated with the team achieving global domination by the 1980s.\nIndia paid a maiden visit in 1976–77, playing one Test match in Perth which resulted in Australia's first victory in the longest form of the game in nearly two decades, marking the beginning of the team's turnaround. The following year, at the 1978 World Cup, Australia defeated England in the final to claim a breakthrough world championship. Captain Margaret Jennings led the team in its triumphant campaign while Sharon Tredrea had a significant impact with bat and ball throughout the tournament which was held in India before crowds of up to 40,000 people.\nAustralia successfully defended their crown at the 1982 World Cup, held in New Zealand, by beating England in the final again. Making their ODI debuts at the start of the tournament, batter Jill Kennare was the leading run-scorer for the team while Lyn Fullston took the most wickets of all players. A talented all-rounder who also represented her country in netball, Fullston was a notable embodiment of two Australian team member archetypes: the prolific left-arm orthodox spinner (paralleled by several successors, including Shelley Nitschke and Jess Jonassen) and the elite dual-sport athlete (further exemplified by the likes of Ellyse Perry and Jess Duffin).\nA dogged English team toured in 1984–85, pulling ahead early in a five-match Test series with a come-from-behind five-run win. Not only did Australia respond resoundingly throughout the remainder of the summer to wrap up a 2–1 series victory, it would take more than 20 years to pass before England would record another Test match victory against their arch-rivals. The fifth Test, played at Queen Elizabeth Oval, saw Australian captain Raelee Thompson—in her last season with the national team—take 5/33 on the first day of play to help set up a seven-wicket win for her country. Jill Kennare and Denise Emerson were key performers with the bat throughout the series.\nAustralia completed a three-peat at the 1988 World Cup, defeating England in the final by eight wickets. Despite recording the significant achievement on home soil at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the match was played in front of just 3,000 people. In another indicator of the development that lay ahead for the women's game, the rate of scoring during the tournament was typically very slow compared to modern ODI standards—in the final, for example, England scored a mere 7/127 from 60 overs while Australia chased down the target in the 45th over.\n1991–2005: Clark era.\n1993 World Cup.\nThe decade-long global dominance of Australia had undoubtedly petered out by the 1993 World Cup when the team finished the group stage in third place, thus failing to qualify for the final. The ultimate blow arguably occurred in their last pool match, suffering a brutal ten-wicket loss to New Zealand after being bowled out for 77. In many respects, however, it also signified the start of an even more fruitful chapter in the team's history. While several core group members, such as Lyn Larsen and Denise Annetts, retired from international cricket at the conclusion of the tournament or soon after, the next generation of stars had already begun to cement themselves at the top level—most famously Belinda Clark and Zoe Goss. The following year, Goss also helped spark an unprecedented amount of attention around the women's game when she dismissed Brian Lara during a charity match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nBy 1995, with Clark having taken the reins of captaincy in the previous year, more cornerstones of a soon-to-be-ominous outfit had been added in batter Karen Rolton and coach John Harmer. A biomechanics expert by trade, Harmer advocated for an exciting and enjoyable approach from his players: \"After my first tour of New Zealand, I took them aside and said, \"'This is so boring, sitting here, watching you lot play. You're scoring at 1.5 an over. That's not cricket. Make runs, take wickets, make the play and do it with a smile on your face.\"'\" In another shift for the game, the inaugural Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) season was held in the summer of 1996–97. Superseding the Australian Women's Cricket Championships which had taken place in a two-week tournament format since 1930–31, the annual WNCL competition enabled a much greater amount of cricket between the country's state teams in order to better develop players and maximise their chances of achieving success at international level.\n1997 World Cup.\nAustralia completed one of their most devastating line-ups ever with the emergence of fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick. Having drifted in and out of the team during the early and mid 1990s, Fitzpatrick found the beginning of a rich and extensive vein of form just in time for the 1997 World Cup in India. The Australians went through the group matches of the tournament undefeated, thrashing teams regardless of their historical strength on the world stage. Not only did they defeat Denmark by 363 runs (which included a record innings of 229 not out by Belinda Clark) and bowled out Pakistan for 27, they also chased down totals set by England and South Africa with half-an-innings to spare. The knockout stage proved to be more closely contested, though Australia nevertheless accounted for India and then New Zealand to reclaim the world championship. The final, played at Eden Gardens, attracted an estimated crowd of at least 50-60,000 people. Triumphant captain Clark has cited the scenes in the aftermath of the match as a career highlight: \"Our victory lap is still etched in my memory, because we were being cheered like a home team. For us to win there was extremely special.\"\nThe returning champions would be paraded around the SCG for a lap of honour during the 1997–98 New Year's Test, after which it was revealed they were going to have to pay for their trip. \"There was a levy that we were supposed to pay after the 1997 World Cup, around about $1800 each,\" Fitzpatrick explained in a retrospective interview, \"but because of all the media around what we'd done, a Bendigo publican stepped forward and said \"'nope, that's not good enough'\" and said he'd pay it. So, this guy we'd never met wiped the debt for all of us. It was fantastic.\" Clark concurred: \"I've never met him, but this guy clearly said \"'this isn't right\"' and paid all our invoices, which we thought was awesome.\" The following year, the Commonwealth Bank became a sponsor of the national women's team after the daughter of CEO David Murray participated in a school clinic (run by Belinda Clark) and became enamoured with cricket. The partnership between the Commonwealth Bank and women's cricket in Australia continues to this day.\n\"The Women's Ashes\".\n64 years into a fierce rivalry, Test series between Australia and England were officially designated as \"the Women's Ashes\" in 1998, derived from the name of the male equivalent. Under the new moniker, the series immediately witnessed a new feat when Joanne Broadbent became the first Australia woman to score a Test double century. Surprisingly, her innings of 200 lasted as a national team record for less than three years, surpassed by Michelle Goszko during the 2001 Women's Ashes. In a further unexpected twist, Karen Rolton topped Goszko's benchmark of 204 merely two weeks later with a then-record score of 209 not out.\nIn late 2001, Women's Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricket Board made the decision to trial the integration of the two organisations, following similar recent initiatives by New Zealand Cricket and the England and Wales Cricket Board. The merger was completed in 2003, resulting in the governing body now known as Cricket Australia, and has been regarded as a positive influence on women's cricket, providing more financial support and gathering more exposure for the sport.\n2005 World Cup.\nAustralia's next major triumph occurred at the 2005 World Cup in South Africa. Having lost the final of the 2000 World Cup in a nail-biter against host team New Zealand, they proceeded to go undefeated in what was a successful campaign of redemption. Shelley Nitschke and Lisa Sthalekar proved to be invaluable all-round additions to the team, while Karen Rolton became the first player to score a century in the knockout stage of a Women's Cricket World Cup by making 107 not out in the final against India. The victory was among the last few appearances Belinda Clark made for Australia, retiring as the country's most prolific scorer in Women's ODIs later that year. She went on to have arguably an even greater impact off the field, serving as an executive for Cricket Australia and helping to transform top-flight women's cricket from an amateur sport into a professional one. Reiterating her distinguished standing in the game, the pre-eminent individual award in Australian women's cricket was named in Clark's honour in 2013.\n2005–2015: Introduction of Twenty20 cricket.\nRolton captaincy.\nThe IWCC was officially integrated with the International Cricket Council (ICC) after the 2005 World Cup, promising to result in \"greater media exposure and publicity\" for the women's game than ever before. Later that year, Australia's 15-match undefeated streak in Tests against England was broken when they lost by six wickets in Worcester. The team's tour of the United Kingdom concluded in Taunton by playing in their first-ever Twenty20 International (T20I) fixture. An innings of 96 not out by Karen Rolton helped the Australians to recover from 3/6, successfully chasing down a target of 153 with seven wickets in hand and 14 balls remaining.\nFollowing the retirement of Belinda Clark, the unsurprising appointment of Karen Rolton as the new Australian captain occurred in early 2006. Rolton's tenure oversaw a challenging transition period in the team's history as the careers of several players from the '90s zenith line-up came to a close—in particular, Cathryn Fitzpatrick made her last appearance for Australia in the final of the 2006–07 Quadrangular Series. Fitzpatrick retired as the world's leading wicket-taker in Women's ODIs at the time and as her country's second-most prolific wicket-taker in Women's Tests behind Betty Wilson. Searching to fill the immense void left by the departure of their premier fast bowler, selectors looked to the future by turning to a 16-year-old Ellyse Perry who would play her first ODI for the team in July 2007. Headlines around Perry's record-breaking debut age were quickly followed up with news of her debut for the national women's soccer team just two weeks later, though interest in the young all-rounder reached a new high in February 2008 when she delivered a Player of the Match performance against England in her maiden T20I.\nAustralia hosted the 2009 World Cup and entered the tournament as favourites, but their performance fell well short of expectations and the team finished in fourth place. Later in the year, at the inaugural Women's T20 World Cup held in England, they were defeated by the host nation in the semi-finals. The following month, Karen Rolton made her last appearance for Australia during the only Test of the 2009 Women's Ashes. After making a duck in the first innings, Rolton compiled 31 on the third day of play to become the only Australian woman to score 1,000 career runs in Test cricket. The match ended in a draw despite a commanding innings of 139 by Jodie Fields, who had already assumed the captaincy from Rolton at the conclusion of the World Twenty20 tournament.\n2010 World Twenty20.\nThe fortunes of the team proceeded to turn around completely within ten months, culminating in triumph at the 2010 World Twenty20 tournament, held in the West Indies. Australia defeated New Zealand in a thrilling final which was ultimately clinched by Ellyse Perry's fielding off her own bowling on the last delivery. Opposition batter Sophie Devine struck a powerful straight drive back down the pitch, threatening to result in a match-tying four runs, but Perry instinctively stuck out her right foot and successfully stopped the ball from reaching the boundary. Following Australia's maiden T20 world title, the prospects of the team became even brighter with Meg Lanning's inclusion during the summer of 2010–11. A prodigious batting talent, Lanning became the country's youngest-ever centurion at 18 years and 288 days by scoring 104 against England in just her second ODI appearance.\nCoach Fitzpatrick era.\nIn early 2012, Shelley Nitschke claimed a fourth-consecutive Belinda Clark Award (presented annually to the team's best player) soon after her retirement. Then, in May, Cathryn Fitzpatrick was appointed as Australia's new head coach. Fitzpatrick's stint at the helm was an extremely productive one which resulted in successful campaigns at the 2012 World Twenty20, the 2013 World Cup and the 2014 World Twenty20 tournaments. Due to timely contributions with the bat, Jess Duffin garnered a reputation as a big game performer during the first two of the three events, earning Player of the Final honours on both occasions. Meanwhile, Lisa Sthalekar capped off a stellar career with a fairytale ending at the 50-over championship in India, incidentally her country of birth. Adopted at three weeks old by an American family, Sthalekar overcame unlikely odds to become the second woman to take 100 career ODI wickets for Australia. She was also the first player in the world to achieve the double of 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in Women's ODIs.\nAhead of the 2013 Women's Ashes, the series structure was changed to a points-based system where matches would include ODIs and T20Is alongside the traditional Test format. England would go on to win convincingly on home soil, and they would retain the trophy more controversially in their expedited Australian tour of 2013–14. Despite winning both limited overs legs of the series, Australia still missed out on regaining the trophy due to losing the Test match, prompting a tweak to the points system for future editions. In the latter portion of the series, an injured Jodie Fields was temporarily replaced as captain of the T20I team by 21-year-old Meg Lanning. This replacement became permanent ahead of the T20 championship in 2014.\nAlong Australia's journey to achieving a World Twenty20 three-peat, Lanning would blast 126 runs against Ireland to set a new world record for the highest score in Women's T20Is. Two months later, she was named captain of the national team in all three formats. The appointment was reported as a \"messy\" handover from incumbent Fields who subsequently retired from international cricket despite urges from Australian selectors to reconsider. More leadership changes soon followed as Cathryn Fitzpatrick decided to step down from her role as head coach in March 2015.\n2015–present: Beginning of the professional era.\nMott appointed coach.\nAhead of the 2015 Women's Ashes, Matthew Mott was appointed as the team's new coach. Australia won the series for the first time since the introduction of the points system, set up by an impressive Test win at the St Lawrence Ground. Jess Jonassen starred with the bat while Ellyse Perry tore through the English line-up with the ball on the last day of play to help record a 161-run victory. Back home, increased investment in the game began to take hold with the establishment of the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL). Domestic women's T20 cricket in the country had previously been played via the Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup in which state squads were drawn from the seven-team WNCL competition. Cricket Australia made the strategic decision to pivot and expand to a women's T20 equivalent of the eight-team model that had already been introduced to the men's game in the form of the Big Bash League (BBL), aiming to further heighten the profile and professionalism of elite-level female cricket.\nDespite initial promising signs, the Mott–Lanning regime was soon on shaky ground after the team suffered shock defeats at two major events in as many years. They lost a tightly contested final to the West Indies at the 2016 World Twenty20, and were then unceremoniously knocked out of the 2017 World Cup via a semi-final upset at the hands of India. Australia's troubles were exacerbated by a shoulder injury to Lanning, who missed several games of the latter tournament and would undergo surgery soon after, sidelining her for six months.\nLandmark pay deal, Southern Stars moniker discontinued.\nWith Lanning set to miss the 2017–18 Women's Ashes, Rachael Haynes stepped in as acting captain and the team retained the trophy via an inconsistent performance across the drawn series. As part of the series, the first-ever women's day/night Test was held at North Sydney Oval, which ended in a draw. The match was also particularly notable for Ellyse Perry's record-breaking innings of 213 not out, the highest score by an Australian in women's Tests.\nContinuing to overhaul its approach to the women's game, Cricket Australia announced in June 2017 that the Southern Stars moniker—an official title of the team for several years—would be discontinued, thereby mirroring the nickname-free national men's team. Then, in August, CA announced it would increase total female player payments from $7.5 million to $55.2 million, with the deal hailed as the biggest pay rise in the history of women's sport in Australia. The on-field performance of the national team began to skyrocket in the wake of this watershed moment.\nAdditionally boosted by the return of their captain, Australia quickly embarked on an extended winning streak in ODI matches and T20I series. They proceeded to win the 2018 World Twenty20, held in the West Indies, with a comprehensive defeat of England in the final which followed a dominant bowling and fielding display throughout the campaign as well as a Player of the Tournament performance by wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy. The gap between the Australians and other cricketing nations appeared to have widened even further by the following year when they crushed England in the 2019 Women's Ashes. Underlining the lopsided nature of the series, several individual records were achieved such as Ellyse Perry claiming the best-ever bowling figures by an Australian woman in ODIs, and Meg Lanning setting a new record for the highest score in a Women's T20I innings for the second time in her career.\n2020 T20 World Cup.\nAustralia quickly turned their attention to the 2020 T20 World Cup, to be held on home soil, which was scheduled as a standalone event from the men's counterpart. With the final fixtured at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a media campaign urging fans to \"Fill the MCG\" ensued. Although this generated a great deal of public interest in the campaign, it also placed a heavy weight of expectation on the team, given that they still had to win their way through to the last night of the tournament. An early loss to India, a scare against underdog Sri Lanka, and a mounting list of injuries to key players ensured Australia's road to the final would not be easy. At one stage, their fate rested entirely on favourable weather, with their must-win semi-final encounter at the SCG against South Africa threatening to be washed out. The rain-reduced match, which was interrupted by several delays, eventually went ahead with Australia claiming a narrow victory and booking their place in the final.\nProducing their best performance of the campaign in the championship decider, Australia defeated India by 85 runs to claim their first T20 World title on home soil. Following an onslaught by the team's batters, the bowling unit led by Jess Jonassen and Megan Schutt restricted the opposition to a low total with the support of a flawless team effort in the field. Beth Mooney's consistent run-compiling form earned her the Player of the Tournament award. A record women's cricket crowd of 86,174 was in attendance for the final which media outlets described as a \"landmark night\" and a \"game changer\". Later in the year, in acknowledgment of the history-making occasion, the national women's cricket team won The Don Award—widely considered the highest honour in Australian sport which is awarded to the athlete or team judged to have most inspired the nation through their performance and example. Son of Sir Donald Bradman and namesake of The Don Award, John Bradman presented the award to the team, saying: \"I have no doubt that my dad would have been absolutely thrilled with this result.\" Greta Bradman added: \"I was there when the team won the T20 World Cup, and it was an emotional day. My grandfather would be so proud of where cricket is today and would be thrilled to know that the whole team is being awarded The Don Award.\"\nAfter a hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia returned to the international cricket stage by hosting New Zealand in September 2020. During the tour, they recorded their 21st-consecutive ODI victory, equalling the world record set by the Ricky Ponting-led Australian men's team in 2003. On 4 April 2021, they managed their 22nd-consecutive ODI victory (again beating New Zealand) to claim the record outright. The streak extended to 26 victories before coming to an end via a two-wicket loss at Great Barrier Reef Arena in the last ODI of India's 2021–22 tour.\n2022 World Cup.\nThe only Test of the 2021–22 Women's Ashes, played at Manuka Oval, ended in a \"dramatic draw\" and was hailed for its \"thrilling finish\". Seven Network analyst Lisa Sthalekar called it \"the greatest Test match that I have been... involved in\", while Fox Cricket commentator Isa Guha described it as \"one of the greatest Test matches in Ashes history\". Having set England an unlikely target of 257 runs from 48 overs on the final day of play, Australia rallied late and took 6/26 in less than six overs to be one wicket away from sealing the win with a mere 13 balls remaining in the match. The visitors managed to survive through to stumps, twelve runs short of a winning total, hence both teams falling just short of victory while also narrowly escaping defeat. Australia proceeded to close out the series with a 12–4 score line, wrapping it up with three consecutive ODI wins and depriving England of a single victory for the entire tour.\nIn the following two months, Australia went through the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup undefeated, culminating in a 71-run win against England at Hagley Oval. With the team claiming a seventh 50-over title and winning 40 of 42 ODIs since their shock semi-final exit in 2017, \"cricket.com.au\"'s Laura Jolly said the triumph was \"the crowning moment of a five-year journey of redemption\". In the championship decider, Alyssa Healy recorded the highest score in a World Cup final innings with 170 runs from 138 balls.\nNitschke appointed coach.\nIn May 2022, Matthew Mott departed to take on the head coach role of the England men's limited overs team. Shelley Nitschke was subsequently elevated from her assistant coach position to interim head coach. Australia then went undefeated throughout the T20 tournament at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, beating India in the final at Edgbaston by nine runs. The following month, Nitschke was confirmed as the permanent head coach of the team. Australia recorded 24 victories throughout the year—their only loss occurred in December during a five-match T20I tour of India, wherein the hosts won the second game of the series via a Super Over.\nAustralia completed another hat-trick of world titles by defeating South Africa in the championship decider of the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup, played at Newlands Cricket Ground. Beth Mooney was named Player of the Final (an honour she also earned six months earlier at the Commonwealth Games), while Ashleigh Gardner was named Player of the Tournament for her all-round performance. Arguably the most memorable moment of the campaign came in the semi-final against India when Australia pulled off a \"remarkable fightback with the ball\" to secure a five-run victory which Meg Lanning described as \"one of the best wins I have been involved in.\"\nUniform.\nFor most of the 20th century, the typical playing attire for female cricketers included skirts or culottes worn with long socks. This deviation from the men's game, in which trousers were standard issue, ended in 1997. The existence and subsequent extinction of the now-infamous culottes, paired with the players previously having to pay out of their own pocket for the unfortunate fashion trend, has been cited as a symbol of the shift from the amateur to professional era in women's cricket.\nThe uniform of the Australian women's team now usually closely resembles that of the national men's team—classic cricket whites and a baggy green cap for Tests, the iconic canary yellow outfit for ODIs (though a predominantly green design was worn for a period in the early 2000s), and often a mostly black ensemble for T20Is—with the main differences found in subtle tapering to better fit the female form where necessary, as well as relevant changes to sponsor logos. An additional small difference can be spotted on the coat of arms (which appears on the baggy green among other items of apparel), wherein the colours of the scroll and the \"Australia\" motto are reversed from red and gold for the men's team to gold and red for the women's team.\nIn February 2020, for the first time, the team wore an Indigenous-themed uniform design (featuring artwork created by Aboriginal artists) in a T20I match against England.\nPlayers.\nFormer players.\nCommonly known players include Meg Lanning,Belinda Clark, Cathryn Fitzpatrick, and Ellyse Perry. Clark and Fitzpatrick are both in the ICC hall of fame, as Lanning, Clark and Perry all captained Australia.\nFor a list of all players in ICC hall of fame, see ICC Cricket Hall of Fame\nNational captains.\nThe current national captain of Australia is Alyssa Healy and the current vice captain of Australia is Tahlia McGrath, but they have been many appointed captains for Australia over the years.\nCurrent squad.\nA minimum of 18 players are offered a Cricket Australia women's contract each year. The program is conducted over a twelve-month period in which the athletes attend approximately three camps per year at the National Cricket Centre and undergo specialist training sessions within their home state.\nIndividual programs are developed for each squad member by the women's team head coach in consultation with the state coaches and the player. The player progress is monitored via testing, coach state visits, training diaries and communication with the athlete's coaches (state and satellite) by the head coach with assistance from the Australian team support staff and relevant state coach.\nThe table below lists the players awarded a national women's team contract with Cricket Australia on 8 April 2024, as well as any active player to make an appearance for the team within the last 12 months. Players not named on the initial list can be upgraded during the following twelve-month period by accruing twelve national team selection points to earn a contract—appearances at Test level are worth four points, while ODIs and T20Is are worth two each.\nKey\nCoaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff of the Australian women's cricket team includes:\nSource:\nSelection panel.\nThe members of the current National Selection Panel for the Australian women's cricket team are:\nSource:"

        "title": "Bob Berry (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Bob Berry (born November 29, 1943) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played eight seasons in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens and Los Angeles Kings between 1968 and 1977. Bob was elected to play in two NHL all star games. He has also served as a head coach in the NHL for the Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues between 1978 and 1994. He has two sons Bradlee and Brock. His grandson Bodie is following in his grandpa footsteps wearing his jersey #18 and playing junior hockey. \nPlaying career.\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Berry began his junior hockey career with the Peterborough Petes of the OHA before deciding to attend Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal where he would play three years of collegiate hockey in the OQAA (now CIS). In 1966 Berry joined Canada's National Hockey Team and was later signed by the Montreal Canadiens to his first professional contract in 1968 at age 25. With the Canadiens having a deep roster at left wing, Berry would only manage to suit up for two games with the Canadiens in 1968-69. He spent the following year playing in the AHL for the Montreal Voyageurs and the Canadiens eventually sold his rights to the Los Angeles Kings in 1970 giving him a better opportunity to earn a spot on an NHL roster. Berry joined the Los Angeles Kings the following year in 1970-71 and registered 63 points in 73 games in his rookie season, placing him only 9 points back of eventual Calder Trophy winner Gil Perreault of the Buffalo Sabres. In 1972-73 Berry scored a career high 36 goals with the Kings and was selected to play in his first NHL All-Star game on January 30, 1973 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Berry was selected to play in the All-Star game again the following year at the Chicago Stadium. He finished his NHL career with 350 points in 541 regular season games.\nCoaching career.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nAfter retiring as a player in 1978 with the AHL's Springfield Indians, he returned to Los Angeles to become the eighth head coach in Kings history in 1978-79. He led the Kings to the Stanley Cup playoffs in each of his three seasons behind the bench. However, in each of those years from 1978–79 to 1980–81 they were defeated in the opening round of the playoffs. Berry eventually resigned as head coach at the end of the 1980–81 campaign after the Kings posted a 43W–24L–13T record and lost to the New York Rangers in the preliminary round. Despite his lack of success in the playoffs, Berry is credited with giving rise to the famed \"Triple Crown Line\" during his tenure as head coach, putting Marcel Dionne, Charlie Simmer and Dave Taylor on the same line for the very first time in a game at Joe Louis Arena in 1979 vs. the Detroit Red Wings.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nHe moved on to take the head coaching assignment in his hometown of Montreal replacing Claude Ruel behind the Canadiens bench to start the 1981–82 NHL season. Despite winning 46 and 42 games respectively in his first two years at the helm, His Canadiens were eliminated in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1981–82 (by the Quebec Nordiques) and in 1982–83 (by the Buffalo Sabres). This would mark the fifth straight season he would lose in the first round of the playoffs as a head coach. With the team playing below .500 in his third year behind the bench in 1983–84, he was eventually fired by the Canadiens and was replaced by Jacques Lemaire 63 games into the season. To date, he is the last non-interim Canadiens coach who was not fully bilingual in English and French, though he spoke French well enough to have a simple conversation.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nHe was named the 9th head coach in Pittsburgh Penguins history on June 4, 1984 a mere 5 days prior to the 1984 NHL Entry Draft that was held at the Montreal Forum in which Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Eddie Johnston selected Mario Lemieux 1st overall from the Laval Voisins of the QMJHL. Even though\nBerry's new team drafted their future franchise player, he inherited a Penguins team that had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons. That streak continued under his guidance for the next three seasons as the Penguins missed reaching the playoffs for the fifth straight year in 1986-87. He was eventually relieved of his head coaching position at the end of the 1986–87 NHL season on April 13, 1987.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nHe returned to coaching for the 1988–89 NHL season after a two-year hiatus, this time joining the St. Louis Blues coaching staff as an assistant with Joe Micheletti under head coach Brian Sutter. He finally got a taste of playoff success behind the bench as his team defeated the Minnesota North Stars in the opening round of the playoffs 4–1. The Blues then faced their rival, the Chicago Blackhawks in round 2 but lost that series in five games.\nThe Blues qualified for the playoffs in the following three seasons. However, they were unable to advance past the second round in either of those years. Berry was appointed assistant GM of the Blues under GM Ron Caron in the summer before the start of the 1992–93 season. The Blues then hired former St. Louis defenceman Bob Plager to take over the head coaching duties. After the Blues got off to a slow start Plager stepped down after a 6–4 victory over Berry's former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, on October 30, 1992. He took over the head coaching duties after Plager's departure and from there he helped the Blues reach the playoffs once again in the spring of 1993. The Blues swept the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round, and he finally made it to the second round of the post-season as a head coach in the NHL. However, his post-season success, as well as the Blues,' was short lived as Berry's team was knocked out in the second round by the Toronto Maple Leafs in a hard fought 7 games series that went the distance. He remained on as head coach of the Blues the next season with Ted Sator joining the fold as an assistant. The Blues made the playoffs once again but were swept in the first round by the Dallas Stars. The St. Louis Blues then named Mike Keenan head coach to start the 1994-95 NHL season with Berry and Sator staying on staff as associate coaches. It remained status quo for the Blues with Keenan and Berry behind the bench as they failed to advance past the second round the following two seasons. 1995–96 would be his final season behind the Blues bench.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nIn San Jose, his was hired on as an assistant under head coach Darryl Sutter to replace the departed Roy Sommer, teaming up with former Calgary Flame tough guy Paul Baxter who was already in place as Sutter's other assistant. He spent two seasons in San Jose as an assistant under Sutter before retiring as a coach in 1999-2000.\nFront office.\nHe currently serves as a pro scout for the Chicago Blackhawks. He has also served as a pro scout in the NHL for the Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues and Ottawa Senators."

        "title": "Colorado Cricket League",
        "text": "The Colorado Cricket League is a non-profit, eight-clubs with 9 teams cricket organization based in the state of Colorado. The league was formalized in 1985.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played in the United States of America since the early 1700s. Cricket has been played in Colorado since the mid-1800.\nColorado cricketers Colin McHattie (Secretary), C. Srinivasan (Treasurer) and Dan Ruparel (President), founded what is now known as the Colorado Cricket League. Ruparel has remained active with the league and the Littleton Cricket Club, McHattie is in Texas and Srinivasan in India. They received endorsements from the five teams that played cricket at that time: The Boulder Cricket Club, The Colorado Cricket Club, The Denver Cricket club, The International Cricket Club of CSU, and The Pakistan Cricket Club. None of these clubs are in existence today, except the CSU Cricket Club (see below) has the most direct roots to its predecessor.\nGames were initially played on grassy pitches, which were often uncut with a jute mat laid on top. In 1994 the league switched to concrete-based, carpeted wickets. Neutral umpires were introduced in 1985.\nThe catalyst that spurred the creation of the Colorado cricket League in 1985 was for hope and expectation to have our players to try out for the US National Cricket team by participating in tournaments in Kansas and Oklahoma, which were part of the USACA's former Central Zone. Unfortunately due to politics the trials were a farce. A year later, the Colorado cricket League pulled out of the USACA in protest, leading a number other leagues to do the same for the same reason - politics.\nPrior to 1985, the \"league\" was comprised on 5 team from Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Games were scheduled by the team captains calling each other to schedule games for the following weekend. If the team was busy with a game with another team or with a community social event, then a verbal commitment was made to play the next available weekend.\nThe captain would then call a representative of another side to get a match scheduled for that weekend. If it worked, a match was played, otherwise the team would end up either playing an intra-squad practice or game and wait for the following weekend.\nUpon formalizing the League, schedules were drawn up, standards were created where initially 35 over per inning matches were played. This was changed to 35 in the second year (1986); and in 1992, 40 overs per inning was adopted. One other important modification was adopted - that of neutral umpires. With 5 teams in the league, there was always an idle side. The idle team were responsible to send their more senior players, who it was expected, knew the rules the best, to umpire the matches.\nOver the years since then the league has made major strides - hosting invitationals, festivals and tournaments and has played in tournaments in California, Utah, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma.\nChampionships.\nCCL participates in the Central Western region's annual championship. In 2004 CCL won the plate trophy. In 2006 CCL took second place. Afan Sheriff represented Central West and was declared MVP of the western conference tournament.\nOrganization.\nIn 1985 CCL was officially incorporated as a non-profit organization. The league runs a cricket tournament which takes place from May to September each year and involves approximately 300 players.\nClubs and teams.\nThe CCL is made up of eight clubs and nine teams.\nTennis Cricket.\nMascarenhas Raymond is credited for being the person to introduce the TennisBall Cricket League in CCL in 2005 that many players enjoy till today. In 2008 Rockers team won the league format of this tournament.\nIn 2010, Orchard won the tournament, while Spartans were runners up.\nWebsite.\nIn 2004 two of the league's members, Michael Doig and Jarrar Jaffari, recognized the need for a central repository for tracking schedules, scorecards, standings, teams and players. Realizing that the web would be most efficient they set about programming and designing the CCL Official Website, driven by the popular PHP language and MYSQL database. The idea was to design a website that would allow a small group of cricket enthusiasts to easily manage a dynamic cricketing portal. This was achieved due to the steadfast dedication of Doig and Jaffari.\nToday the CCL boasts detailed news analysis and statistics of each of its games dating well back into the 1990s. It can be proud that it stands strong and well above many cricketing leagues on the planet for its comprehensive coverage and passion."

        "title": "Beamer (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball, without bouncing, passes above the batsman's waist height. This kind of delivery is dangerous, as a batsman will be expecting the ball to bounce on the pitch. The failure to bounce makes it much harder to avoid the ball or to hit it with the bat. It is usually an accident caused by the ball slipping from the bowler's hands at delivery, but they have been bowled deliberately, an act highly contrary to the Laws of Cricket and the sportsmanship expected of the players.\nThis type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty is an immediate no-ball and, in Twenty20 and one-day matches, a free hit. The use of beamers is governed under Law 41.7. The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match), as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Fast bowlers, particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques, are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers, albeit accidentally.\nA beamer may not necessarily be bowled with intent. It may be due to sweaty hands or a wet ball, causing a slipped release from the hand. It is also possible that the bowler attempts to bowl a yorker which goes askew.\nA bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces, called a bouncer. These are easier to play or avoid than beamers, as beamers do not land on the pitch and are illegal, batsman's are caught by surprise and the technique of batting, using feet and body movement to meet the ball after it pitches does not apply.\nAbdur Rehman, a Pakistani spin bowler, bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh, and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legitimate ball, despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.\nShoaib Akhtar, Pakistani fast bowler, admitted that he bowled a beamer against Mahendra Singh Dhoni on purpose."

        "title": "List of Super Bowl champions",
        "text": "The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums. Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\nBefore the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast. Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games. \nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \nThe 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. Only two franchises have ever won the Super Bowl while hosting at their home stadiums: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.\nSuper Bowl championship games.\nNumbers in parentheses in the table are Super Bowl appearances as of the date of that Super Bowl and are used as follows:\n Indicates a team that made the playoffs as a wild card team (rather than by winning a division).\nConsecutive wins.\nEight franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:\nAlthough no franchise to date has won three Super Bowls in a row, several have had eras of sustained success, nearly accomplishing a three-peat:\nConsecutive losses.\nThree franchises have lost consecutive Super Bowls:\nConsecutive appearances.\nThe Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins (1971–1973) and New England Patriots (2016–2018) are the only other teams to have at least three consecutive appearances. All three teams with three or more consecutive Super Bowl appearances are in the AFC East division. Including those three, 11 teams have at least two consecutive appearances. The Dallas Cowboys are the only team with three separate streaks (1970–1971, 1977–1978, and 1992–1993). The Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos, and New England Patriots have each had two separate consecutive appearances. The Kansas City Chiefs are the most recent team to appear in consecutive Super Bowls, playing in Super Bowl LVII and Super Bowl LVIII. The full listing of teams with consecutive appearances is below in order of first occurrence; winning games are in bold:\nSuper Bowl rematches.\nThe following teams have faced each other more than once in the Super Bowl:\nSuper Bowl records by team.\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of wins, followed by the total number of appearances, and finally by the number of points scored by the team throughout all appearances. Included in the table are all of the team names that each franchise has had since the 1966 season, a.k.a. the start of the Super Bowl era.\nTeams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories.\nEight teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning. In descending order of number of appearances and then years since their last appearance, they are:\nTeams with no Super Bowl appearances or long active droughts.\nFour current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL). The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season. Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts (as of the end of the 2023 season, after Super Bowl LVIII):"

        "title": "Junior ice hockey",
        "text": "Junior ice hockey is amateur-level ice hockey for 15- to 20-year-old players. National Junior teams compete annually for the IIHF World Junior Championship. The United States men's national junior ice hockey team are the defending champions from the 2024 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nHockey Canada.\nThere are four levels of Junior hockey in the Canadian Club System: 1. Major Junior, 2. Junior A, 3. Junior B, and 4. Junior C. Not all teams playing in Canadian Junior leagues are based in Canada. , there were approximately twelve US-based teams playing in various Major Junior and Junior A leagues in Canada.\nIn 2023, BC Hockey announced plans to restructure its Junior framework following the departure of its only Junior A league. Its three Junior B leagues (PJHL, KIJHL and VIJHL) were re-styled as \"Junior A Tier 2\", with plans to promote some to \"Junior A Tier 1\" following an independent evaluation. It was expected that those teams promoted to \"Junior A Tier 1\" would eventually apply for membership in the CJHL, an association of Junior A leagues governed by Hockey Canada and its regional branches. BC Hockey expected the evaluations to be completed during the 2024—25 season.\nMajor Junior.\nMajor Junior is the highest level of Junior ice hockey in Canada. There are three Major Junior leagues that collectively make up the Canadian Hockey League (CHL):\nThe championship teams from each league, as well as a pre-selected host team, compete for the Memorial Cup in a national championship tournament.\nMajor Junior players become ineligible to play college hockey in the United States, because they are considered to be professionals by the NCAA. Major Junior players retain their eligibility for Canadian universities however, and all three leagues have scholarship programs for players.\nThe CHL places a cap of three 20-year-old players per team, and allows up to four 16-year-olds on each roster. While 15-year-old players were formerly permitted to play a limited number of games per season at the CHL level, they are now permitted to play only if they are deemed exceptional by Hockey Canada. , seven players have qualified under this rule: centre John Tavares in 2005, defenceman Aaron Ekblad in 2011, centre Connor McDavid in 2012, defenceman Sean Day in 2013, centre Joe Veleno in 2015, centre Shane Wright in 2019, and forward Connor Bedard in 2020. CHL teams are currently permitted two \"imports\" (players from outside Canada and the US) each.\nUp until 1970, the leagues that were classified as Major Junior and \"Junior A\" today were both part of Junior A. In 1970 they were divided into \"Tier I Junior A\" or \"Major Junior A\" and \"Tier II Junior A\". In 1980, the three Major Junior A leagues opted for self-control over being controlled by the branches of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and became Major Junior hockey, Tier II Junior A became the top tier of hockey in the CAHA and became Junior A hockey.\nJunior A.\nJunior A (Junior AAA in Québec; Tier 1 in British Columbia) hockey is one level below Major Junior. It is governed by the respective regional branches of Hockey Canada. The CJHL is an association of nine Junior A leagues: AJHL, SJHL, MJHL, SIJHL, NOJHL, OJHL, CCHL, LHJQ, and MHL. The national championship is the Centennial Cup. Unlike Major Junior players, Junior A players retain their NCAA eligibility and may go on to play college hockey in the US.\nIn 2023, the BCHL withdrew from the Hockey Canada framework, and thus became an independent league. In response, BC Hockey announced plans to restructure its Junior framework, which included an opportunity for some Junior B teams (styled \"Junior A Tier 2\" by BC Hockey) to be promoted to Junior A (styled \"Junior A Tier 1\" by BC Hockey) and eventually seek membership with the Canadian Junior Hockey League. The league expected the evaluations to be completed during the 2024—25 season.\nJunior B.\nJunior B (Junior AA in Québec; Tier 2 in British Columbia) was created in 1933, to differentiate between teams eligible for Memorial Cup competition and those who were not. The major championships across Canada are the Sutherland Cup in Southern Ontario, the Barkley Cup in the Ottawa District, the Coupe Dodge in Quebec, the Don Johnson Cup in the Atlantic Provinces, and the Keystone Cup that represents all of Western Canada, from British Columbia to Northwestern Ontario.\nJunior C.\nJunior C (Junior A in Québec) generally consists of local competitions, but is considered competitive in some regions, and serve as seeding or farm-teams for Junior B teams. Ontario Junior C Hockey has six rounds of best-of-seven playoffs (up to 42 games per team) for the Clarence Schmalz Cup which was first awarded in 1938. The Ontario Junior C playoffs are played for between six of the Province's seven different regional leagues. In Quebec and West of Manitoba, Junior C hockey tends to be an extension of the local minor hockey system and is sometimes called Juvenile or House League. In Ontario, Manitoba, and the Maritimes, Junior C is run independently of minor hockey systems, though with the same mostly recreational purpose.\nUSA Hockey.\nJunior ice hockey in the United States is sanctioned by USA Hockey. The top level is Tier I, represented by the United States Hockey League. Tier II is represented by the North American Hockey League. There are several Tier III and independently sanctioned leagues throughout the country. Some US-based teams play in Canadian leagues outside of the USA Hockey framework.\nTier I.\nThe United States Hockey League (USHL) is currently the only Tier I league in the country, consisting of teams in the central and midwestern United States. The USHL provides an alternative to the Canadian Hockey League, which pays its major junior hockey players a stipend, for players who wish to maintain NCAA eligibility for later in their career.\nWhile playing in the USHL, all player expenses are paid for by the team; no membership or equipment fees are charged. Unlike major junior teams, free-college stipend does not exist. Historically, professional leagues have drafted less directly from USHL teams, although this trend has shifted in recent years, coinciding with the USNTDP moving to the USHL in 2009-10. In the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, 17 of the 44 players drafted out of the USHL played for the USNTDP. Those 44 draft picks were 16 more than any of the three leagues in the Canadian Hockey League, and included 9 first round picks (8 of which came from the USNTDP) and 7 second round picks.\nFor most of its existence the USHL was considered inferior in quality of play to the major junior levels. But it continued to improve and as of 2019 about 21 percent of NHL players had played USHL in their career. Between 80 and 90 percent of USHL players continued into NCAA hockey.\nTier II.\nCurrently, the North American Hockey League is the only USA Hockey-sanctioned Tier II league in the United States. The NAHL consists of teams spread across the western two thirds of the United States with a significant concentration of teams in the central and southwestern parts of the United States, although the league began to expand to east coast as of 2015. In October 2016, the Tier III United States Premier Hockey League, a league predominately located on the east coast, applied to USA Hockey for approval of a Tier II league to begin in the 2017–18 season, however, the league was denied that December and decided to operate its Tier II league independently.\nThe NAHL, like the USHL, provides young players an alternative to major junior hockey, although the skill level is considered significantly lower than major junior hockey and typically filled with those who would not or did not make the roster of a Tier I team. Unlike Tier I, the NAHL does not pay for all players' expenses, such as room and board, but there is no tuition cost to the player as in Tier III.\nTier III.\nIn addition to paying for room and board, players at the Tier III level pay a fee or tuition, commonly ranging from $4,000 to $9,500. This is for all accounts and purposes an amateur level, although some players go directly to NCAA Division I schools. Most Tier III players are looking to increase their skills in hopes to move up to Tier II or I, while other players go directly to NCAA Division III, ACHA and CHF schools.\nPrior to July 2011, USA Hockey split Tier III into Junior A and B divisions. USA Hockey currently has one sanctioned Tier III league, the North American 3 Hockey League\nIndependent leagues.\nSome Junior ice hockey leagues operate outside the framework of governing bodies such as Hockey Canada and USA Hockey, typically due to disagreements with governing bodies over player recruitment policies and finances. These leagues are sometimes referred to as 'unsanctioned', 'rogue' or 'outlaw' leagues due to their lack of sanctioning or oversight from an outside governing body.\nSince 2006, the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League has operated as an independent league in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. The league widely recruits players from outside of North America.\nIn late 2016, the United States Premier Hockey League, an organization composed of several USA Hockey Tier III Junior as well as many youth hockey leagues, applied for a Tier II league. The Tier II status was denied in December 2016 but the USPHL moved forward with the new league anyway, creating the National Collegiate Development Conference. In response, the USPHL has removed all their junior level leagues (the NCDC and the Tier III-level Premier and Elite Divisions) from USA Hockey sanctioning since the 2017–18 season.\nIn 2022, the Eastern Hockey League, which was operating two Tier III leagues, also left USA Hockey sanctioning.\nIn 2023, the Junior A British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) withdrew its membership with Hockey Canada and became an independent league.\nEurope.\nIn Europe, Junior teams are usually associated with a professional team, and are used by professional teams to develop their own prospects. One example of this is the J20 SuperElit league in Sweden or the Minor Hockey League in Russia.\nThe lack of an amateur draft in Europe means that the onus is on the teams to sign the most talented young players they can get, and the presence of an affiliated junior team provides a place for young players who are not yet ready for the rigours of the professional game to develop. However, not all players on a European junior team are necessarily property of their professional club, and may elect to sign elsewhere.\nAt the World Hockey Summit in 2010, nations in Europe expressed concern about the number of junior players leaving to play in North America, despite the improved talent level and the increasing popularity of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships. Slavomir Lener, a director with the Czech Ice Hockey Association, felt that Junior-aged players were enticed to play in North America before maturation, with a negative effect on the development of the player and the European system. He stated that of the 527 Czech Republic players who went to North American Junior hockey, only 22 of them played more than 400 NHL games. He sought to establish a European system that was competitive enough to deter players from entering into the CHL Import Draft."

        "text": "Robert Edward Montgomery (born April 16, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player and television sports commentator. Nicknamed \"Monty\", he played his entire career in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher, and also played six games at first base, for the Boston Red Sox from 1970 to 1979. He batted and threw right-handed.\nMontgomery signed for the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1962 and played for seven of their minor league affiliates until 1970, when the Red Sox promoted him to the major leagues. There, he served as the team's backup catcher behind future Hall of Fame inductee Carlton Fisk. He spent the next nine years with the Red Sox and played his last game on September 9, 1979. Montgomery is notable for being the last major-league player to bat without wearing a helmet.\nPersonal life.\nMontgomery was born on April 16, 1944, in Nashville, Tennessee. Baseball played a huge role in his family; his father frequently took part in sandlot ball, while his brother Gerald played for several minor league affiliates of the Boston Red Sox. Montgomery attended Nashville's Central High School. Although he actively participated in three sports, he was most inclined to baseball, playing in the outfield, at first base and pitching.\nUpon his graduation from high school. Montgomery was signed by George J. Digby, a renowned scout who worked for the Boston Red Sox organization.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nMontgomery began his professional baseball career for the Olean Red Sox, a minor league baseball team that were members of the New York–Penn League. Playing both third base and the outfield, he batted .273, enough to earn him a promotion to the Class-A Waterloo Hawks of the Midwest League in the following season. It was here that Montgomery was encouraged by manager Len Okrie to switch positions to catcher, in order to improve his chances of being promoted into the major leagues.\nBoston Red Sox (1970–1979).\nIn , Major League Baseball made it compulsory for all players to wear batting helmets, although active players like Montgomery were allowed to continue batting without one per a grandfather clause. Montgomery opted to utilize this privilege, choosing to strengthen the inside of his cap with protective lining instead. Consequently, Montgomery was the last major league player to bat without wearing a helmet when he played his final game on September 9, 1979.\nIn 387 career games, he compiled a .258 batting average with 23 home runs and 156 runs batted in.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter his playing career, Montgomery spent fourteen seasons (1982–1995) as the color commentator for Red Sox telecasts on WSBK-TV and NESN (1985–1987). Montgomery now owns and operates Big League Promotions which manufactures game boards using professional sports licensing.\nHe has also served as a color analyst for telecasts of the minor-league Pawtucket Red Sox and Portland Sea Dogs on NESN and Cox Sports."

        "title": "Delivery (cricket)",
        "text": "A delivery or ball in cricket is a single action of bowling a cricket ball toward the batter. Once the ball has been delivered, batters may attempt to score runs, with the bowler and other fielders attempting to stop this by getting the batters out. When the ball becomes dead, the next delivery can begin.\nDuring the play of the game, a member of the fielding team is designated as the bowler and bowls deliveries toward the batter. Six legal balls in a row constitutes an over, after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the pitch toward the batter standing at the opposite wicket at the other end of the pitch. Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or over the wicket, is knowledge of which the umpire and the batter are to be made aware.\nSome forms of cricket limit the number of legal deliveries that may be bowled in each innings; for example, 100-ball cricket has a maximum of 200 legal deliveries in the game (unless there is a tie). Every delivery in a cricket match is notated by the number of completed overs that have occurred before that delivery, as well as which delivery in the current over that delivery is; for example, \"Over 14.2\" indicates that 14 overs have been completed and the second delivery of the 15th over is the one under consideration. Since illegal deliveries do not count towards the progression of an over, a set of consecutive illegal deliveries (and the legal delivery that follows them) will have the same notation. Illegal deliveries generally occur when a bowler bowls from too close to the batter, or delivers the ball out of the batter's reach.\nLegal and illegal deliveries.\nAll deliveries are either legal (also known as fair, valid, or \"one of the over\"), illegal, or in rare circumstances, called dead and invalidated. \nIllegal deliveries.\nAn illegal delivery always results in the batting team being awarded one run in addition to any other runs scored off the illegal delivery, does not count towards the completion of an over, and is divided into two categories: wides and no-balls. No-balls are considered a more serious infraction than wides, with the batters being shielded from most methods of dismissal, and in some competitions result in the batting team being awarded two additional runs and/or a \"free hit\" on the next legal delivery (on a free hit delivery, the batters have the same protections against being dismissed as on a no-ball).\nWides.\nA delivery is called wide if it is so far out of reach of the striker that it can not be hit by the striker through the use of a normal cricket stroke. Note however that a delivery may not be called a wide if the striker changes their positioning before the ball is bowled in such a way that they bring the ball within their reach. \nNo-balls.\nA delivery can be called a no-ball for various reasons, which may pertain either to the actions of the bowler or the other players on the fielding team. The most common reasons a no-ball occurs are because the bowler either fails to keep some part of his front foot behind the popping crease when bowling the ball, or bowls the ball and it reaches the striker above the waist without having bounced before reaching the striker.\nTypes of delivery.\nDeliveries can be made by fast bowlers or by spin bowlers. Fast bowlers tend to make the ball either move off the pitch (‘seam’) or move through the air (’swing’), while spinners make the ball ’turn’ either toward a right-handed batter (as in the case of off spin and left-arm unorthodox spin) or away from him (as in the case of leg spin and left-arm orthodox spin).\nThe ball can bounce at different distances from the batter, this is called the \"length\" of the delivery. It can range from a bouncer (often bouncing as high as the batter's head) to a yorker (landing at his feet).\nThere are many different types of delivery that a bowler can bowl. These deliveries vary by: technique, the hand the bowler bowls with, use of the fingers, use of the seam, how the ball is positioned in the hand, where the ball is pitched on the wicket, the speed of the ball, and the tactical intent of the bowler.\nTactical considerations.\nThe variations in different types of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length, are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal. Throughout an over, the bowler will choose a sequence of deliveries designed to attack the batter's concentration and technique, in an effort to get him out.\nThe bowler also varies the amount of loop and pace imparted to various deliveries to try to cause the batter to misjudge and make a mistake. As the crease has a width, the bowler can change the angle from which he delivers to the batter in an attempt to induce a misjudgement.\nUsually, the bowler decides what type of delivery to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batter and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, since he has a unique view of the batter and may be able to spot weaknesses of technique.\nAnother piece of information important for the bowlers to consider prior to their deliveries is the state of pitch. The pitch is a natural ground and its state is subjected to variation over the course of the cricket, some of which are multi-day events such as test matches. Spinners find an old pitch, one that has been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that has not come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.\nThe batter's anticipation of the delivery.\nWhile a bowler, with the use of variations in their delivery aims to target the concentration of batters as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batter, as emphasised by Jodi Richardson. Richardson reveals the world class batter's dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batters' anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the ball leaving the bowler's hand and reaching the batter's crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean Müller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence. The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batters in cricket. They revealed that experienced batters possessed a unique ability which enabled them to adjust their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon their reading of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batters use while on the crease is referred to as 'advance information' by Richardson. Moreover, Müller's research outlined that the presence of this 'advance information' was not as evident among the lesser skilled batters in comparison to the experienced ones.\nControversies and debate involving deliveries.\nUnderarm bowling.\nUnderarm or lob bowling was the original cricket delivery style, but had largely died out before the 20th century, although it was used until 1910 by George Simpson-Hayward, and remained a legal delivery type. On 1 February 1981, when Australia was playing New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, and New Zealand needed six runs to tie the match from the final ball. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain, ordered the bowler (his brother Trevor) to bowl underarm, rolling the ball along the ground to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batter (Brian McKechnie) any chance of hitting a six from the last ball to tie the match.\nAfter the game, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rob Muldoon, described it as \"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket.\" At the time, underarm deliveries were legal, but as a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as \"not within the spirit of the game.\" The 2000 \"Laws of Cricket\" declares that an underarm delivery is illegal \"unless otherwise agreed before the match\".\nSuspect bowling actions.\nA recently retired cricketer who was greatly embroiled in controversy and under scrutiny from critics over his method of executing deliveries was the Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Michael Selvey describes the accusations placed on the bowler in relation to his widely disputed bowling action and delivery, stating the Australian prime minister's reference to the Sri Lankan as a 'chucker.' The controversy linked to Muralitharan's delivery emerged in 1995, when the umpire of the test match between Sri Lanka and Australia deemed Muralitharan's delivery as illegal on the suspicion that he was throwing the ball. Selvey acknowledges this as the factor sparking an 'international cricket incident,' with critics and some extremists going as far as insisting on the exclusion of all of the Sri Lankan's accomplishments throughout his career from the records of cricket. However, Suresh Menon takes an adamant stance on the topic of the controversy surrounding the spinner by displaying appreciation for Muralitharan's actions. Menon suggests that investigation into Muralitharan's deliveries led to the revelation of imperfections present in the bowling action and deliveries of the previously considered 'picture-perfect' fast bowler, Glenn McGrath. This was made possible with the usage of technology and its replacement of the earlier system, which Menon refers to as 'the naked eye.' Eventually, it was declared legal for the bowlers to bend their arm fifteen degrees for deliveries in cricket.\nComparison to baseball.\nA delivery or ball in cricket is analogous to a \"pitch\" in baseball. The word \"ball\" in cricket usage does not imply anything about the accuracy of the , unlike baseball's usage of \"ball\" to indicate a pitch outside the strike zone. The closest cricket equivalent of a baseball \"ball\" is a wide."

        "title": "Bruce Weber (basketball)",
        "text": "Bruce Brett Weber (born October 19, 1956) is a former men's basketball head coach at Kansas State University. Prior to his tenure at Kansas State, Weber was the head coach at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois.\nWeber won conference championships and conference coach of the year awards at each of the three schools where he served as head coach. He guided his teams to a combined total of 13 NCAA tournaments in 24 seasons, including an appearance with Illinois in the championship game of the 2005 NCAA tournament. Weber was the consensus national coach of the year in 2005.\nCoaching.\nEarly career.\nWeber began his coaching career with a brief stint as a graduate assistant coach at Western Kentucky University during the 1979–80 season under head coach Gene Keady. In 1980, Weber moved to Purdue University along with Keady. He remained an assistant coach at Purdue for 18 seasons before becoming the head coach at Southern Illinois University in 1998.\nSouthern Illinois.\nIn his five seasons at Southern Illinois, Weber led the Salukis to consecutive Missouri Valley Conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances in 2002 and 2003, including a Sweet Sixteen finish in 2002.\nUniversity of Illinois.\nOn April 30, 2003, Weber was hired by Illinois to replace Bill Self, who had departed from Illinois to take the head coaching job at Kansas.\n2003–04 season.\nThe Illini played a tough early season game against North Carolina on December 2 in Greensboro, and were tied at 69 with just six minutes to go. Illinois eventually lost the game 88–81, but it proved to be a good test for the young team with no seniors in the starting lineup. Weber faced his toughest test after starting the conference schedule with an even 3–3 mark. He changed many doubters' minds by winning the remaining ten games on the conference schedule, winning the Big Ten title outright for the first time since 1952. The Illini finished second losing to Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament championship game. They received a bid as a #5 seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament, defeating Murray State and Cincinnati in the first two rounds to reach the Sweet Sixteen. A 72–62 loss to top-seeded Duke ended their tournament run, but capped a solid first season for coach Weber.\n2004–05 season.\nThe 2005 season opened with high expectations and the return of all the team's starters. On December, 1 the Illini defeated the number-one ranked team, Wake Forest, 91–73, at Assembly Hall. Weber sported a glowing orange blazer for the game, and Assembly Hall was painted orange by the 16,618 fans wearing school colors. The pressure grew for Weber as the victory vaulted the Illini to the top spot in the polls the following week, a spot they would carry for the rest of the season. Regular season perfection and their 29–0 record ended on the last game of the regular season, however, as Illinois lost a 12-point, second half lead to Ohio State and lost on a last second shot to the Thad Matta-coached Buckeyes, 65–64. The Illini won the Big Ten regular season and Tournament titles.\nIn the 2005 NCAA tournament the team received the overall #1 seed, and top seed in the Midwest Regional. Illinois defeated Fairleigh Dickinson and Nevada in the first two rounds in Indianapolis. In the Sweet Sixteen, Weber led the Illini to a victory over his alma-mater, Milwaukee, then defeated Arizona in an amazing comeback to advance to the Final Four. After leading Illinois to a win over Louisville in the Final Four, Weber could not deliver the Fighting Illini their first national championship, falling 75–70 to North Carolina in the National Championship game.\nWeber coached the team to the best record in school history, finishing 37–2, and tying the NCAA record for most wins in a season. Weber won many coaching awards after the season, including the Naismith Award and the Henry Iba Award.\n2005–2012.\nDespite losing three starters to the NBA, the Illini finished the 2005–06 season with a 26–7 record and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2006–07 season had a disappointing start, including the first three-game losing streak in Weber's tenure. However, the Illini rebounded to finish 23–11 and again qualify for the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2007–08 season marked the first time during Weber's tenure that the Illini did not qualify for a postseason tournament, finishing the season with an overall record of 16–19, 5–13 in the Big Ten.\nThe team improved markedly the following year, however, finishing 24–10, 11–7 in the Big Ten and returning to NCAA tournament.\nAfter a 10–0 start to the 2011–12 season, Weber's Illini went 7–15, finishing the season with a 17–15 record.\nOn March 9, 2012, one day after the Illini lost its Big Ten tournament opening-round game to Iowa, Weber was relieved of his duties. During his nine-year tenure as Illinois coach, Weber amassed a Big Ten record of 89–64, and an overall record of 210–101. At the time of his firing, his overall win percentage with Illinois (67.5%) stood as second only to Bill Self in the modern era and his 210 wins were the third-most in school history, behind only Lou Henson and Harry Combes.\nKansas State University.\nOn March 31, 2012, Weber was hired as head coach at Kansas State University, replacing Frank Martin, who had departed to become head coach at South Carolina. \nIn his first season at K-State, Weber led the Wildcats to 27–8 record and tied for the Big 12 Conference title with a 14–4 conference mark. The title was K-State's first regular-season conference championship since 1977. Weber was named the 2013 Big 12 Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year. His first season at KSU ended with an upset loss in the second round of the NCAA tournament to LaSalle, 63–61, in Kansas City's Sprint Center. The team finished ranked #12 in the nation in the AP Poll and #20 in the Coaches Poll. Senior Rodney McGruder was named first-team all-conference.\nShortly after the end of Weber's first season, starting point guard Ángel Rodríguez and two other players announced their intentions to transfer. Kansas State's roster was further thinned when incoming freshman Neville Fincher was declared ineligible for the 2013–14 season, and incoming point guard Jevon Thomas was declared ineligible for the fall semester.\nWeber started his second season at Kansas State 0–1, but finished the non-conference schedule with an 8-game winning streak and a 10–3 record. In its first conference game, Kansas State upset #6 Oklahoma State and earned a #25 ranking in the following week's AP Poll. The team finished the regular season with a 20–12 record, 10–8 in the Big 12, and returned to the NCAA tournament for a school-record fifth straight season.\nWeber's third season at Kansas State ended with a 15–17 record (8–10 in Big 12 play), and the school did not advance to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2009. The losing record was only the second for Weber in his first 17 seasons as a head coach. Following the season, Weber's squad saw the transfer and departure of six scholarship players, including Marcus Foster, Jevon Thomas, Nigel Johnson, Tre Harris and Malek Harris. The following season, Weber's Wildcats finished the 2015–16 season 17–15, 5–13 in Big 12 play.\nIn 2016–17, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament and finished with a 21–14 (8–10) record. In 2017–18, the team improved to 25–12 (10–8) and advanced to the Elite Eight of the 2018 NCAA tournament, including a 61–58 win over Kentucky in the Sweet Sixteen. The team received a #19 national ranking at season's end in the Coaches Poll.\nIn 2018–19, the team tied with Texas Tech for its second regular-season Big 12 Conference title under Weber, with a 14–4 conference record. For the third consecutive season, Kansas State was invited to the NCAA tournament. After an upset first-round loss in the NCAA tournament, the team finished with a 25–9 record and a #18 national ranking in the AP Poll, and #19 ranking in the Coaches Poll. Two players from the team were named first-team all-conference: Dean Wade and Barry Brown Jr.\nAfter winning two conference titles and making five NCAA tournament appearances in his first seven seasons at KSU, Weber's final three teams posted losing records: 11–21 in 2020, 9–20 in 2021, and 14–17 in 2022. The day after a loss to West Virginia in the Big 12 tournament, Weber announced his resignation from Kansas State. \nWeber's tenure with Kansas State concluded with two conference co-championships and five NCAA Tournament appearances, including an appearance in the 2018 Elite Eight. At the time of his resignation, he ranked third on K-State's all-time total wins list, behind only Jack Hartman and Tex Winter, and 11th in overall winning percentage.\nNational team.\nIn the summer of 2019, Weber coached the United States national under-19 team at the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup in Heraklion, Greece. His team won the tournament championship with a 7–0 record.\nPost-Coaching Career.\nWeber joined Big Ten Network as a studio analyst in 2022 and occasionally serves as a color commentator.\nPersonal.\nWeber was born in Milwaukee to Louis and Dawn Weber, growing up with two sisters and two brothers. Weber attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and played college baseball for the Milwaukee Panthers. He graduated from UWM in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in education. Weber added a master's degree in education administration and physical education from Western Kentucky University in 1981. He is married to Megan Weber, and has three daughters – Christy, Emily, and Hannah."

        "title": "Baseball (1983 video game)",
        "text": " is a video game from Nintendo. It was released December 7, 1983, after the July 15 launch of the Famicom in Japan. In 1984, it was ported to the VS. System arcade as VS. Baseball with additional graphics and speech, becoming a number one hit in Japan and North America that year. It was localized as a Nintendo Entertainment System launch game in North America in 1985, and in Europe in 1986. \"IGN\" said the universal appeal of the American sport made \"Baseball\" a key to the NES's successful test market introduction, and an important piece of Nintendo history. The game was also competing with Sega's arcade hit \"Champion Baseball\", released earlier in 1983.\nGameplay.\nAs in real baseball, the object of the game is to score the most runs. The game supports one player versus a computer opponent, or two players. Each player can select from one of six teams.\nThough lacking a license of official team names, their initials in the game correspond to the Japanese Central League or the American Major League Baseball teams in their respective regions. The only gameplay difference between teams is the uniform colors.\nDevelopment and release.\nShigeru Miyamoto recalled that in 1983, he \"personally really wanted there to be a \"Baseball\" game\" for the Famicom, and was \"directly in charge of the character design and the game design\". The Famicom had only three launch day games on July 15, 1983, and \"Baseball\" was released on December 7totaling seven games by 1984.\nAt the 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the Manhattan initial test market, the game was featured prominently among 17 total games. It was demonstrated on a large projector screen, by real Major League Baseball athletes who played the video game and signed autographs for fans. Because the video game industry was so young and had crashed in America in 1983, and because some other NES launch games like \"Clu Clu Land\" have abstract fantasy themes that are not instantly recognizable by a new audience, the presence of a traditional American pastime was said to be an instantly relatable aid to the system's introduction.\nIt was ported to the arcade VS. System as \"VS. Baseball\" in 1984, competing with Sega's popular \"Champion Baseball\" (1983).\nReception.\nIn Japan, copies of the original Famicom version of \"Baseball\" were sold. Worldwide, copies were sold for Famicom and NES.\n\"Game Machine\" magazine named \"VS. Baseball\" as Japan's most successful table arcade cabinet of June and July 1984. In the United States, \"VS. Baseball\" topped the arcade software conversion kit charts for several months in 1984: the \"RePlay\" charts from September through October to November, and the \"Play Meter\" charts from October to November. \"Play Meter\" also listed it as the top-grossing arcade game in December 1984. In Europe, it had become a very popular arcade game by 1986.\nIn 2007, \"IGN\" gave \"Baseball\" a 5.5 out of 10, noting its depth of pitching, its two-player support, \"its still-intact sense of fun\", and its important place in Nintendo's history. The review said that the 1985 test market launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System had \"heavily relied upon\" \"Baseball\", due to the globally recognizable status of the sport. The review summarized that \"the NES came out a winner—thanks, in part, to \"Baseball\"\".\nIn 2006, \"GameSpot\" gave \"Baseball\" a 4.2 out of 10, stating that while it was easy to play, the \"bare-bones\" replica of the sport \"hasn't withstood the test of time\".\nIn 2020, historian Ken Horowitz said \"VS. Baseball\" (1984) lacks certain features of the competing Sega's \"Champion Baseball\" (1983), but has superior multiplayer capabilities.\n\"Baseball\" was a significant source of inspiration for Namco's \"\" (1986) for Famicom, which became the \"R.B.I. Baseball\" series."

        "title": "Dan Johnson (baseball)",
        "text": "Daniel Ryan Johnson (born August 10, 1979) is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for six teams, over ten seasons, as well as one season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), but never held a Major League starting job for an entire season. He is perhaps best known for hitting a dramatic two-out, two-strike home run for the Tampa Bay Rays in the bottom of the ninth inning of the last game of the 2011 season, also known as Wild Card Wednesday. That home run tied the game, which the Rays eventually won, sending them to the playoffs. His clutch hitting for the Rays, along with his red hair and beard, earned him the nickname \"The Great Pumpkin\".\nAlso within his extensive Minor League Baseball career that began in 2001, Johnson has won a Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in two different Triple-A leagues. He won the Pacific Coast League MVP in 2004 and the International League MVP in 2010.\nIn 2016, Johnson signed with the Rays organization, entering spring training as a knuckleball pitcher.\nHigh school and college.\nJohnson graduated from Blaine High School, in Blaine, Minnesota in 1997. He then attended Butler University for his freshman year, when he was named All-Conference in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference. He transferred to a junior college, and finally ended up at the University of Nebraska, where he helped the Cornhuskers make a College World Series appearance, and earned All-American honors.\nMLB career.\nOakland Athletics.\nJohnson played his rookie season with the Athletics in , batting .275 with 15 home runs and 58 RBIs. He struggled early in , batting .237 before being demoted to the A's Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Sacramento River Cats, in July. He returned to the A's roster on August 31, and finished the season with a .234 batting average, 9 home runs, and 37 RBIs. It was later discovered that he suffered from double vision due to getting suntan lotion in his eyes, and he was able to clear up the problem for the season.\nJohnson was expected to be the A's starting first baseman in 2007, but suffered a torn labrum in his hip late in spring training and missed the first three weeks of the season. He returned April 25 and proceeded to get a hit in 16 of his first 18 games. He was named American League co-Player of the Week with teammate Jack Cust for the week of May 7–13. After the hot start, Johnson fell into a slump that lasted the rest of the season and plummeted his batting average to .236. His worst month was July, in which he batted just .156 (10-for-64 in 19 games) with two home runs and eight runs batted in. On April 9, , Johnson was designated for assignment.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn April 18, 2008, he was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays. However, five days later he was again designated for assignment. He was subsequently outrighted to Triple-A Durham three days later. On September 9, Johnson was called up by the Rays from Durham. He entered the game as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning, and hit a home run against the Boston Red Sox, tying the game. The game was viewed as pivotal in the AL East Division race, as the Rays would go on to win in extra innings, keeping the Red Sox from claiming the division lead that night. The Rays would not relinquish first place for the remainder of the season, and went on to win their first division title in franchise history en route to an American league pennant and an appearance in the World Series.\nHe batted .192 with a .276 on-base percentage for the 2008 season.\nYokohama Baystars.\nJohnson signed a one-year contract for $1.2 million with the Yokohama Bay Stars of the Japanese Central League where he batted .215 in the 2009 season.\nBack to Tampa Bay.\nOn January 11, 2010, Johnson signed a 1-year $500,000 major league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. Johnson was called up from Durham to the Rays in August 2010. On August 28, he hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning against the Boston Red Sox. He batted just below the Mendoza line for the 2010 season, with a .198 batting average. He had 23 RBIs, 22 hits in 111 at bats, 3 doubles, and 7 home runs.\nOn April 8, 2011, with the Rays trailing 7–6 against the Chicago White Sox and two men on, Johnson hit the first pitch from Matt Thornton off the top of the Miller Lite Bullpen Sports Bar fence for a three-run home run, which would later prove to be the game-winner as Tampa Bay beat Chicago 9–7.\nOn May 20, 2011, Johnson was designated for assignment, and then recalled on September 14, 2011.\nOn September 28, 2011, with the Rays tied with the Boston Red Sox in the American League wild card race in the final game of the season, Johnson hit a pinch-hit home run with two outs and two strikes in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game against the New York Yankees. It was the first hit for Johnson since April 27. The Rays went on to win the game in extra innings, and coupled with a loss by the Red Sox, clinched the AL Wild Card.\nJohnson was honored by MLB for his Game 162 home run with the GIBBY (Greatness in Baseball Yearly) 2011 Moment of the Year Award This Year in Baseball Awards. Bill Chastain wrote, \"Many baseball experts have called the final night of the 2011 season the best in baseball history.\" The seat at Tropicana Field in the right field corner where the home run ball landed (Section 140, Row T, Seat 10) is now colored white and known as the Dan Johnson seat.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn February 1, 2012, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He also received an invitation to spring training. He played for the Charlotte Knights, Triple-A affiliate of the White Sox.

        "title": "Equestrian events at the 1968 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Equestrian competitions at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico featured team and individual competitions in show jumping, eventing, and dressage. Mexico City proved a challenging site since it was 2,300 meters above sea level, resulting in 30% less oxygen in the air. The horses at the 1955 Pan American Games, which was also held in Mexico City, arrived a few weeks before the Games to adjust, but had difficulty in the competition. However, racehorses that competed at the same location and who were shipped in the day before, and left the day after the race, performed fine. It was discovered that although horses would adjust immediately to the high altitude during the first few days after arrival, they showed weakness and decreased performance around Day 10, which continued to Day 20. Therefore, nations were advised to ship in horses 3–4 weeks before the competition, which would allow them time to recover from the long travel, as well as adjust to the difference in altitude. Argentina, Ireland, and the USSR were the first to ship horses over, who arrived mid-September. France and Germany were the last countries to send their horses, who arrived 28 September 20 days before the competition was to start.\n125 entries (including 22 women) from 18 nations competed: Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, German Democratic Republic (GDR), France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Soviet Union, Switzerland, and the USA. The youngest participant was Yevgeny Kuzin from the Soviet Union at 20 years old, while the oldest rider was Lorna Johnstone from Great Britain at 66 years old.\nThe 1968 Games timed the equestrian events manually and electronically, but for the first time the electronic time was considered official.\nDisciplines.\nShow jumping.\n51 riders from 16 countries contested the team and individual competitions. The 14 obstacle course for the team competition had 17 efforts, and was measured at 631 meters in length. However, only 4 of 87 rounds were within the 96 second time, prompting some to believe that the course was incorrectly measured and was really 693 meters in length. The individual competition consisted of 3 courses. The first was a 750-meter course. Round B was similar to a puissance course, with its major obstacle being a 1.70 meters high and 2.20 meters wide oxer. Round C was a 370-meter jump off.\nThe Irish Team had tough luck this year, after their first rider on course, Diana Conolly-Carew, was eliminated. Due to miscommunication, the Irish chef de’équipe was told that his entire team had been eliminated. Therefore, the horse of second rider Ada Matheson was sent back to the stable, so was not ready when she was called, eliminating her from the competition. The final rider, Ned Campion, later rode, but with two of the riders eliminated the team was also eliminated.\nThe Canadian show jumping team won the final event of the Mexico City Olympics when it captured the Team Show jumping contest at the Estadio Olympico which guaranteed a \nworldwide television audience. Canada would not win their next Summer Olympics gold medal until 1984.\nDressage.\n8 full teams competed in the dressage event, with 3 riders to a team. Additionally there were 2 individual riders from Mexico, making a total of 26 riders from 9 nations competing. The 1968 Games Grand Prix dressage test had 33 movements and lasted 12 minutes 30 seconds. It was judged by men from Chile, France, and the Netherlands, since none of these countries had riders competing. Germany and the USSR had 2 riders each in the top 4, earning them gold and silver team medals. Josef Neckermann and his mount Mariano were in first after the Grand Prix with 948 points, well ahead of Ivan Kizimov and Ikhor (908 points) and Reiner Klimke and Dux (896 points). These three riders, along with 4 others that made it into the ride-off for individual medals, performed a shortened (6 minute, 45 second) test. However, Kizimov rode a great test for 664 points, compared to Neckermann's 598, allowing him to pull ahead for the individual gold medal.\nEventing.\nThe eventing cross-country at the 1968 Olympic Games was notoriously difficult, and today would not be acceptable for competition. Originally Oaxtepoc was chosen as the site for the cross-country course, but between the footing (very rocky) and the climate (hot and humid), the organizers decided to move the course to the golf club of Avandaro in the Valle de Bravo. Although it was at higher altitude (1,800 meters vs Oaxtepoc's 1,450 meters), it had a mild climate with a cool breeze. However, it was also known for intense rainfall from October to March, a fact that was ignored and which resulted in very serious difficulties for the competitors.\n30 of the 49 riders managed to complete Mario Becerril's 35 obstacle course before a heavy rain fell. Although it lasted only 30 minutes, the penultimate obstacle, a 2 meter wide stream, became 12 meters in width and flooded the entire take off point for the horses. In addition to the trouble caused by that fence, there were two equine fatalities which occurred before the rain: the USSR's Ballerina and the Irish eventer Loughlin. When all horses had completed, Jean-Jacques Guyon, Jim Wofford and Pavel Deev were in the top three with less than a 10-point margin between them.\nThe show-jumping phase also took its toll, after Wofford fell off Kilkenny and dropped into 6th. Deev was in contention for individual gold, but jumped the wrong fence and was eliminated. This allowed Guyon to move up to the gold medal spot, followed by British rider Derek Allhusen on Lochinvar and American Michael Page on Foster.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:"

        "title": "Chris Guccione (tennis)",
        "text": "Christopher Luke Guccione ( ; born 30 July 1985) is an inactive Australian professional tennis player from Greenvale, Victoria. He has won five ATP Tour doubles titles, and reached career-high rankings of singles world No. 67 in April 2008 and doubles world No. 38 in November 2014.\nPersonal life.\nGuccione is of Italian descent on his father's side. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. He is married to Andra Kucerak, with whom he has two children.\nTennis career.\nGuccione is coached by countryman and former ATP professional Anthony Lane. Guccione is noted for his good service; he hit 50 aces in a three-set qualifying match at Wimbledon in 2005. The good service has led fellow Australian player Mark Philippoussis to call him a \"Wayne Arthurs clone\". He is a serve-and-volley player. Despite these strong assets in the game he has still yet to win any ATP titles and very rarely makes it past the first round of major tournaments. During his career, he has won 5 ATP Challenger Series: hardcourt victories in Burnie and Canberra in 2005, clay court victories in 2006 at Quito and Medellín, and a victory on hardcourt at Aptos in 2009. \nHe has had greater success as a doubles player, often partnering with fellow Australians Carsten Ball and Sam Groth. Guccione has represented his country in several Davis Cup ties, compiling a winning record. In a 2011 tie against Switzerland, for example, he teamed with Lleyton Hewitt to beat the Olympic gold medal-winning team of Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.\n2004.\nGuccione burst onto the scene at the 2004 Medibank International tournament, where he defeated former World No. 1 (and then-World No. 3) Juan Carlos Ferrero 6–3, 7–6. At that time Guccione was not even ranked in the top 400. Despite this momentous victory, he lost to world no. 32 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7–6, 7–5 in the second round. In the Australian Open he won his first round match against Australia's Alun Jones 6–3, 7–6, 6–2. He was eliminated in the next round by American Robby Ginepri 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In November, he won the first singles tournament of his career in Berri, South Australia. He defeated fellow Australian Robert Smeets in straight sets 6–4, 6–4 in the final. \n2005.\nGuccione's first tournament of the year was the Australian Open. He played world no. 12 Guillermo Cañas and lost in straight sets 6–4, 6–2, 7–6. In February, Guccione won his first Challenger title of his career in Burnie, defeating Gouichi Motomura of Japan 6–3, 7–5. In April 2005 at Canberra, he won another Challenger title after he defeated Germany's Lars Uebel 7–5, 6–1 in the final. His next tournament was the French Open. It was his first French Open of his career. Despite this, he defeated Spain's Santiago Ventura in the first round 6–3, 2–6, 6–1, 3–6, 6–2. He was knocked out in the second round by home-favourite Paul-Henri Mathieu 6–3, 6–4, 6–4. He did not participate in any more grand slams in 2005. \n2006.\nIn January 2006 Guccione managed to once again defeat Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Medibank International. In February 2006, Guccione won the deciding fifth and final rubber against Switzerland's George Bastl in the Davis Cup. He continued this Davis Cup success in April at Kooyong in Victoria when he defeated his more experienced opponent, Max Mirnyi, in the opening Quarter-final tie against Belarus. Despite winning all but one of his 2006 Davis Cup matches, Guccione was dropped from the Australian Davis Cup Team to make way for the returning Mark Philippoussis. \n2007.\nGuccione began his 2007 season in Adelaide with a wildcard entry at the Next Generation Adelaide International. There, he beat world number 93, Amer Delić 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, world number 58 Benjamin Becker 7–5, 6–3, and world number 42 Arnaud Clément 7–6, 7–6. Reaching his first ATP quarterfinal—the only Australian to do so in Adelaide—Guccione continued his run and upset number 2 seed and world number 18 Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals 1–6, 6–3, 7–6 to reach his first ATP semifinal. In the semi-finals, he defeated another first-time semifinalist, 92nd ranked Juan Martín del Potro 5–7, 6–3, 7–5, to reach his first ever career ATP tour final, where he lost to Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the final 6–3, 6–7, 6–4, ending his run of victories over top-100 ranked players at five.\nAfter success at the Adelaide International Guccione reached a ranking of 107 in the world. Guccione began his second tournament of 2007 in the Medibank International beating Rafael Nadal in the first round. Leading 6–5 with Nadal to serve, Nadal withdrew due to an injury.\nGuccione was unable to continue his success into the Australian Open, losing in the first round to Belgian Olivier Rochus 3–6, 7–6, 7–6, 6–7 9–7. Guccione's 2007 season then turned disastrous, not recording one win for over a month, Guccione then qualified for Las Vegas through a lucky loser handout. Guccione then qualified for the American double Tennis Masters Series, Indian Wells and Miami but was unable to get past the first round in both tournaments.\nAt the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, Guccione's first round match was against Great Britain's Alex Bogdanovic. Guccione won in straight sets 7–6, 6–4, 6–4. Chris Guccione's 2nd round match was against the 6th seed Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Guccione squandered a 2 sets to 0 lead, losing the match in 5 sets.\n2008.\nPrior to the AO Series 2008, John Newcombe lashed out at Guccione for his lack of match fitness, saying that \"with his height and his serve, he could be fucking lethal out there\"\", and for not realising his considerable potential: \"he should be top-30 in the world and trouble anyone if he was properly fit.\"\nGuccione's 2008 AO campaign commenced at the 2008 Next Generation Adelaide International with a win over Wayne Odesnik. However, Guccione was unable to defend his 2007 runner-up points at the Next Generation Adelaide International, succumbing to second seed Paul-Henri Mathieu in the second round.\nGuccione responded with a run at the Medibank International in Sydney. Guccione won his first match against qualifier world number 138 Alberto Martín. Despite Lleyton Hewitt's fantastic record against compatriot Australians, Guccione knocked him out in the second round. Showing signs of the form from the 2007 Next Generation Adelaide International, Guccione scalped world number 14 Tomáš Berdych and world number 32 Radek Štěpánek storming his way to the final against Dmitry Tursunov. However, his dream run came to a halt as he was edged out. Guccione was unable to replicate his form at the 2008 Australian Open, losing to Hyung-Taik Lee in straight sets.\nThe American Tennis Tournament Series kick started at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships, Memphis, and Guccione defeated world number 117 Robert Kendrick and world number 54 Thomas Johansson. The Sydney rematch against world number 34 Radek Štěpánek in the quarter-finals went in favor of Stepanek.\nGuccione failed to qualify for the Indian Wells Masters tournament. However, in the Sunrise challenger, a warm-up tournament for the Miami Masters, Guccione recorded his best ever win against world number 12 Fernando González in the semifinals. However, he was unable to continue his form as he failed to qualify for the Miami Masters. Despite this, Guccione rose to his highest career singles ranking of 67 on 7 April.\nFollowing Guccione's U.S. stint, he returned to Australia for the Oceania qualifying Davis Cup tie against Thailand. Guccione opened the tie against Thai number 1 Dani Udomchoke and was taken to 5 sets before winning.\nHowever Guccione was unable to carry on the momentum he had created over the past couple of months, losing in the first round of 7 of his next 8 tournament appearances including first round losses at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Guccione finished the year ranked 96.\n2009.\nGuccione's 2009 season started in poor fashion, losing to American Amer Delić in the first round of qualifying at the inaugural Brisbane International. Guccione had been upset prior to the commencement of the tournament after he had been shunned of a main draw wildcard in favor of younger players Bernard Tomic and Brydan Klein. After his match Guccione was too distraught to talk to the media.\nHowever the following week at the 2009 Sydney International, Guccione bounced back with an impressive 6–3, 6–4 win over 6th seed Tomáš Berdych before going on to lose in the following round to eventual finalist Jarkko Nieminen, 7–6, 6–3.\nDespite falling out of the top 100 after his loss in Sydney, Guccione went on to win his first match at the Australian Open since he made his debut in 2004, defeating Nicolas Devilder of France 6–4, 6–2, 6–4 before losing in four sets to 7th seed Gilles Simon in the second round.\nGuccione teamed up with Lleyton Hewitt in March 2009 to play Thailand in the 2nd round of the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone. After Hewitt lost to Danai Udomchoke in the 4th rubber, it was left to Guccione to defeat Kittiphong Wachiramanowong in the deciding match. He won 6–3, 7–5, 7–6, sending Australia into a 3rd round clash against India in May.\nGuccione and George Bastl beat Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich in doubles 7–5, 7–6, to win the final of the Israel Ramat HaSharon Challenger tournament in May 2009. He had reached the third round of the Cincinnati masters, defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first round and world number 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second. Guccione lost to Tomáš Berdych in the third round 4–6, 3–6, and then suffered an Achilles injury on the foot while playing doubles at Washington which affected his preparations before the US Open. He lost in the first round in singles to Pablo Cuevas. At the same tournament he reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal partnering fellow Australian Carsten Ball as alternate pair where they lost to top seeds the Bryan brothers.

        "title": "Enforcer (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Enforcer is an unofficial role in ice hockey. The term is sometimes used synonymously with \"fighter\", \"tough guy\", or \"goon\". An enforcer's job is to deter and respond to dirty or violent play by the opposition. When such play occurs, the enforcer is expected to respond aggressively, by fighting or checking the offender. Enforcers are expected to react particularly harshly to violence against star players or goalies.\nEnforcers are different from pests, players who seek to agitate opponents and distract them from the game, without necessarily fighting them. The pest's primary role is to draw penalties from opposing players, thus \"getting them off their game\", while not actually intending to fight the opposition player (although exceptions to this do occur). Pests and enforcers often play together on the same line, usually the fourth line.\nNational Hockey League.\nAt present in the National Hockey League (NHL), teams generally do not carry enforcers on their roster, as their general lack of hockey skills makes them a liability, and the trend away from fighting further reduces their usefulness. Enforcers can play either forward or defense, although they are most frequently used as wingers on the fourth forward checking line. Prized for their aggression, size, checking ability, and fists, enforcers are typically less gifted at skill areas of the game than their teammates. Enforcers are typically among the lowest scoring players on the team and receive a smaller share of ice time. They are also not highly paid compared to other players, and tend to move from team to team.\nEnforcers are nevertheless often popular on their teams. John Branch wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"The enforcer, sometimes mocked as a goon or euphemized as a tough guy, may be hockey's favorite archetype. Enforcers are seen as working-class superheroes—understated types with an alter ego willing to do the sport's most dangerous work to protect others. And they are underdogs, men who otherwise might have no business in the game.\" \nJohn Scott's reputation as an enforcer and fan favorite helped him earn enough fan votes to secure a spot in the 61st National Hockey League All-Star Game, despite having been demoted out of the league at the time of his election. He unexpectedly played a key role in his division's victory by scoring two goals, where fan response also led to him being named the most valuable player of the tournament. Fighting skills can allow insufficiently talented or smaller players to play in leagues where their hockey skills alone would not have otherwise granted them admission.\nEnforcers sometimes take boxing lessons to improve their fighting. Some players combine aspects of the enforcer role with strong play in other areas of the game. Tiger Williams, Bob Probert, Chris Simon, and Tom Wilson are examples of enforcers who showed an occasional scoring flair, with Williams and Probert playing in the midseason All-Star Game. Terry O'Reilly once scored 90 points in a season, being the first player to finish in the top ten regular season scorers while amassing at least 200 penalty minutes, and later became captain of the Boston Bruins.\nSometimes enforcers can do their job by virtue of their reputation. Clark Gillies was among the best fighters in the NHL during his prime, but over time he rarely had to fight because opponents respected and feared him enough that they would not go after his teammates. Some skilled players, such as legends Gordie Howe and NHL all-star Jarome Iginla are also capable fighters and can function effectively as their own enforcer. A \"Gordie Howe hat trick\" is a player scoring a goal, assisting on a goal, and being involved in a fight during a single game.\nChanging role.\nIn the 1970s, the Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers were known respectively as the \"Big Bad Bruins\" and \"Broad Street Bullies\", for stocking up on grinders and enforcers.\nThe role of the enforcer has diminished since rule enforcement changed following the 2004–05 NHL lockout to increase game speed and scoring. With a decrease in fighting, teams are less inclined to keep a roster spot available for a one-dimensional fighter who is a liability as a scorer and defender. This has led to a decrease in the number of players whose predominant role is enforcer.\nInstead, more well-rounded players are expected to contribute aspects of the enforcer role. Intimidation and fighting continue to be utilized as a strategy in the NHL. In the 2007–08 NHL season fights occurred in 38.46% of the games, up from 33% the season before, which was just below the pre-lockout fighting level of 41.14% of games in the 2003–04 season. The frequency has steadily declined over time, from 1.3 fights per game in the late 1980s to 0.5 in 2012. Major penalties for fighting declined by 25% annually in the first half of the 2011–2012 season.\nSummer 2011 enforcer deaths.\nAnother possible reason for the decline in fighting and the use of the enforcer role is greater awareness of the risks from head trauma and resulting chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and the mood alteration that is associated with the condition. During the summer of 2011, three NHL enforcers died. Derek Boogaard died at the age of 28 from an accidental mixture of painkillers and alcohol. Rick Rypien died at the age of 27 from what was later confirmed as a suicide. Wade Belak was found dead at the age of 35 in his Toronto hotel room in circumstances that caused a newspaper's police source to categorize his death as a suicide. A year earlier in July 2010, Bob Probert died of an apparent heart attack in his mid-40s. Later tests indicated brain damage and CTE from his years of fighting.\nRetired enforcer Georges Laraque has suggested that the National Hockey League Players' Association provide counselling to enforcers. Sports journalist and writer Roy Macgregor opines that in light of recent tragic events there should be more done about it, including eliminating the role altogether. \"New York Times\" sportswriter John Branch covered Boogaard's death and the \"epidemic\" of chronic traumatic encephalopathy that has come as a result of frequent head trauma sustained by hockey enforcers."

        "title": "1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 48 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball. It began on March 11, 1982, and ended with the championship game on March 29 in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. A total of 47 games were played.\nNorth Carolina, coached by Dean Smith, won the national title with a 63–62 victory in the final game over Georgetown, coached by John Thompson. James Worthy of North Carolina was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThis tournament was the first to eliminate the national third-place game, which had been held every year since the 1946 tournament. It was also the first tournament to be televised by CBS after it acquired the broadcasting rights from NBC. Gary Bender and Billy Packer (also from NBC Sports) called the Final Four and National Championship games. In addition, it was the first tournament to include the word \"Men's\" in its official title, as the NCAA began sponsoring national championships in women's sports (including basketball) in the 1981–82 school year.\nThis was the last NCAA tournament to grant automatic bids to the winners of ECAC regional tournaments for Northeastern Division I independents organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference, a loose sports federation of Northeastern colleges and universities. The practice had begun with the 1975 tournament to ensure that Northeastern independents would not be excluded, but was discontinued when all remaining Northeastern independents formed new conferences or joined existing ones after this season.\nFor the first time since 1966, the tournament field did not include UCLA.\nChampionship game.\nThe 1982 NCAA Division I Men's Championship Game was between the Georgetown Hoyas and the North Carolina Tar Heels. Both teams had Hall of Fame coaches, Dean Smith for the Tar Heels and John Thompson for the Hoyas. As for players, five future NBA All-Stars were included between the two sides—the Hoyas featured center Patrick Ewing and Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, while the Tar Heels answered with forward James Worthy, forward and center Sam Perkins, and young guard Michael Jordan. This also marked the only NCAA championship game to feature three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players (Jordan, Ewing and Worthy) chosen in 1996 on the occasion of the NBA's 50th anniversary.\nThe championship matchup was tightly contested throughout, with no team ever leading by more than a few points, and 15 lead changes in the game overall. With slightly over a minute to go, Floyd scored to put Georgetown on top, 62–61. During the ensuing timeout, Smith predicted that Georgetown would heavily guard Worthy and Perkins and drew up a play that would work the ball around to Jordan and then met Jordan's eyes and told him to not be afraid to shoot if he was open. When the ball was worked around, Jimmy Black found Jordan on the left wing, and he rose and hit a jumper with 17 seconds to go to put Carolina back on top, 63–62. Georgetown did not call timeout but immediately pushed the ball up the court. However, guard Fred Brown mistook Carolina's James Worthy for a teammate and passed the ball right to his opponent. Worthy was fouled by Eric Smith with two seconds to go. He missed both free throws, but with no timeouts left (Georgetown coach John Thompson, in a questionable move, used his last one before Worthy's free throws rather than save it to set up a final play) the Hoyas' last desperation shot fell short. On the other hand, Dean Smith's decision to draw up a play for Jordan, rather than Worthy or Perkins, is often regarded as a brilliant coaching move.\nAside from the dramatic finish in the final minute, the 1982 NCAA championship game is today primarily remembered as being the stage on which several eventual basketball legends were introduced to a national audience, particularly North Carolina's Jordan and Georgetown's Ewing, both 19-year-old freshmen at the time of this game. Both had outstanding games - Jordan with 16 points including the game-winner, and Ewing with 23 points and 10 rebounds (but also a few goaltends on blocks that John Thompson supported for intimidation purposes). Jordan and Ewing would go on to have more memorable clashes in the National Basketball Association with the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks respectively, and both would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.\nThe real star of the 1982 title game, and a third player in this game who would eventually be inducted to the pro basketball Hall of Fame, was Carolina's James Worthy. Worthy scored a game-high 28 points, showing the blazing speed and some of the same authoritative drives to the basket that later became familiar sights during his career with the powerful Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s. Beyond these three legendary players, two other outstanding pro players of the 1980s and early 90s appeared in this 1982 game: Georgetown's Sleepy Floyd, who went on to an All-Star career in the NBA (including a still-standing record for most points in a quarter and in a half for a playoff game) and Carolina's Sam Perkins, who distinguished himself over a durable NBA career lasting 17 seasons.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1982 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)"

        "title": "Felipe López (baseball)",
        "text": "Felipe López (born May 12, 1980) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball infielder.\nHigh school career.\nIn 1998, López graduated from Lake Brantley High School in Altamonte Springs, Florida where he set school records by hitting .521 with 15 doubles, five triples, seven home runs, 28 runs batted in and 34 stolen bases in his senior year. He was also voted Florida's Player of the Year, was a \"USA Today\" All-USA selection, and was rated by \"Baseball America\" as the best defensive high school shortstop in the country.\nProfessional career.\nToronto Blue Jays (2001–02).\nLópez was a 1st round pick of the Toronto Blue Jays (8th pick overall) in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He made his Major League debut on August 3, 2001, and played second base and shortstop part-time.\nCincinnati Reds (2003–06).\nOn December 1, 2002, the Blue Jays traded the switch-hitting Lopez as part of a four-team trade with the Cincinnati Reds, Oakland A's, and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Toronto Blue Jays sent him to the Cincinnati Reds, who sent pitcher Elmer Dessens to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks sent first baseman Erubiel Durazo to the Oakland Athletics, who, in turn, sent minor league pitcher Jason Arnold to the Blue Jays.\nAfter backing up Barry Larkin during the and seasons, López earned the starting job in . López's first season as the Reds' regular shortstop was his breakthrough. He hit 23 home runs and stole 15 bases while compiling a .291 batting average with a .352 on-base percentage. He was selected to the 2005 National League All-Star team.\nWashington Nationals (2006–08).\nLópez was traded by the Reds on July 13, 2006, to the Washington Nationals along with Austin Kearns and Ryan Wagner for Gary Majewski, Bill Bray, Royce Clayton, Brendan Harris, and Daryl Thompson, a minor league prospect. In 2006, he tied for the Major League lead in errors at shortstop, with 28, and had the lowest fielding percentage (.954).\nWhen first traded to the Nationals, López's original jersey number was 7, however when Damian Jackson was traded, he turned in his number 7 for Jackson's previous jersey number 2.\nIn , he had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL shortstops, .957, and often found himself switching between the position of shortstop and second base. This switch was due to the recovery of the Nationals original shortstop, Christian Guzman, who had injured himself in 2005, though he later gave the position back to Lopez after sustaining yet another injury during the 2007 season.\nOn April 24, 2008, López hit a grand slam to give Washington a 7–3 lead en route to a 10–5 victory over the Mets. On July 31, 2008, López was released by the Nationals.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2008).\nLópez was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals on August 5, 2008.\nHe debuted August 6 when the Cardinals played the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played left field and recorded a single in his first at bat, finishing the game 1 for 3. Lopez closed out the season batting .385 with the Cardinals and brought his season average up to .283. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\nArizona Diamondbacks (2009).\nOn December 12, 2008, López signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Lopez hit two home runs in his first two at-bats in his first game with the Diamondbacks, which is the first time that has happened since Richie Sexson in 2005 with the Seattle Mariners. Lopez and teammate Tony Clark were also the first players to hit a home run from both sides of home plate on Opening Day in a 9–8 win over the Colorado Rockies.\nLopez hit lead-off for The Diamondbacks, and posted a .305 average through 84 games, as well as 6 Home Runs, 25 RBI, and 44 runs.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2009).\nOn July 19, the Milwaukee Brewers acquired López in exchange for minor league outfielder Cole Gillespie and pitcher Roque Mercedes. He went 4 for 4 in his debut with the Milwaukee Brewers.\nIn 2009, Lopez tied for the Major League lead in errors by a second baseman, with 17.\nSecond stint with St. Louis Cardinals (2010).\nOn February 27, 2010, López signed a one-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals. López' base salary will be $1 million plus performance incentives of $1.2 million.\nOn April 17, 2010, López started against the New York Mets at shortstop, was moved to third base, and then pitched in the 18th inning of the game. Although the Cardinals eventually lost the game in the 20th inning, López pitched a scoreless inning, giving up only one hit and a walk. He then went on the DL, and came back and took over as the starting third baseman for the Cardinals after David Freese had a season ending foot injury. He eventually became the backup when the Cardinals acquired Pedro Feliz.\nOn September 21, 2010, López was released by the St. Louis Cardinals because he wasn't fitting in with the team's focus on younger players.\nBoston Red Sox (2010).\nLópez was claimed by the San Diego Padres, but he rejected the claim to become a free agent and signed with the Boston Red Sox, because he would not feel a part of the team as he would be ineligible for the Padres post-season roster. On September 28 López made his debut with the Red Sox.\nTampa Bay Rays (2011).\nOn February 2, 2011, López signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays with an invite to spring training. On May 3, the Rays designated him for assignment to make room on the 25-man roster for Evan Longoria coming off the disabled list. He had his contract purchased on May 22 when Reid Brignac was placed on the bereavement list.\nOn June 12, 2011, López was designated for assignment again when Elliot Johnson was activated from the 15-day disabled list.\nReturn to Milwaukee (2011).\nLopez was traded back to the Milwaukee Brewers on July 28, 2011, for cash considerations. On August 21, after recording a .182 batting average in 51 plate appearances for Milwaukee, he was designated for assignment. After the 2011 season, he elected for free agency.\nExternal links.\n, CPBL"

        "title": "United States at the 2006 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The United States sent 204 athletes to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Chris Witty, a four-time Olympian, who competed in both Summer and Winter games, and won a gold medal in speed skating at the 2002 Games, served as the flag bearer at the opening ceremonies. Speed skater Joey Cheek, who won gold in the 500 m and silver in the 1000 m, was the flag bearer at the closing ceremonies. One athlete, Sarah Konrad, became the first American woman to compete in two different disciplines at the same Winter Olympics – biathlon and cross-country skiing.\nWhile the United States' total medal count was down from the 2002 Winter Olympics, there were many highlights to the Games. Pete Fenson led the U.S. Curling team to a bronze medal, their first curling medal ever won. Speed skater Shani Davis became the first athlete of African descent from any country to win an individual gold medal. He won gold in the 1,000 m and followed that with a silver medal in the 1,500 m. Ice dancers Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto won America's first figure skating ice dancing medal in 30 years.\nMedalists.\nThe following U.S. competitors won medals at the games. In the by discipline sections below, medalists' names are bolded.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe American alpine ski team fell short of its self-proclaimed goal of eight medals, earning only two in Turin, both gold. Bode Miller, who won two gold medals at the 2005 World Championships, failed to medal in Turin, but the men's team still earned a gold medal, as Ted Ligety took a surprise victory in the combined. The other medal came from Julia Mancuso, who put together two strong runs to win the women's giant slalom.\nMen\nWomen\nBiathlon.\nThe top finish from the U.S. biathlon team came from Jay Hakkinen, who was 10th in the men's individual event.\nMen\nWomen\nBobsleigh.\nShauna Rohbock and Valerie Fleming, bronze medalists at the 2005 World Championships, had four strong runs to earn the United States' only bobsleigh medal in Turin.\nMen\nWomen\nCross-country skiing.\nTwo skiers, Kikkan Randall and Leif-Orin Zimmermann, were suspended due to health reasons for the first five days of competition after showing abnormally high values of hemoglobin in their blood. Randall eventually was cleared to compete, participating in the women's relay and finishing 53rd in the 10 kilometre classical race.\nDistance\nMen\nWomen\nSprint\nMen\nWomen\nCurling.\nIn the men's event, Pete Fenson, who led his team to 4th place at the a 2006 World Championships, started inconsistently, with a 2–2 record that included a win over the defending gold medalists from Norway. A stretch of four straight wins, however, guaranteed them a spot in the medal round going into a final round-robin game with Canada. The Americans lost that game, meaning they would face Canada again in the semifinals. They also lost this second meeting, but recovered to win the United States' first ever curling medal by beating Great Britain 8–6 in the bronze medal game.\nOn the women's side, Cassandra Johnson, the 2005 World Championship silver medalist, struggled winning only two games and finishing well short of the mark needed to make the medal round.\nSummary\nMen's tournament.\nTeam\nRound-robin\nDraw 1\n\"Monday, February 13, 9:00\"\nDraw 3\n\"Tuesday, February 14, 14:00\"\nDraw 6\n\"Thursday, February 16, 14:00\"\nDraw 9\n\"Saturday, February 18, 14:00\"\nDraw 12\n\"Monday, February 20, 14:00\"\nDraw 2\n\"Monday, February 13, 19:00\"\nDraw 5\n\"Wednesday, February 15, 19:00\"\nDraw 8\n\"Friday, February 17, 19:00\"\nDraw 10\n\"Sunday, February 19, 9:00\"\nSemifinal\n\"Wednesday, February 22, 19:00\"\nBronze medal game\n\"Friday, February 24, 13:00\"\nWomen's tournament.\nTeam\nRound-robin\nDraw 1\n\"Monday, February 13, 14:00\"\nDraw 3\n\"Tuesday, February 14, 19:00\"\nDraw 6\n\"Thursday, February 16, 19:00\"\nDraw 9\n\"Saturday, February 18, 19:00\"\nDraw 12\n\"Monday, February 20, 19:00\"\nDraw 2\n\"Tuesday, February 14, 9:00\"\nDraw 4\n\"Wednesday, February 15, 14:00\"\nDraw 7\n\"Friday, February 17, 14:00\"\nDraw 10\n\"Sunday, February 19, 14:00\"\nKey: The hammer indicates which team had the last stone in the first end.\nFigure skating.\nThe American figure skating team won two medals in Turin, both silver. Sasha Cohen led the ladies' singles event after the short program, but an early fall in the free skate left her in second place. In the ice dance, the team of Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto sat just sixth after the compulsory dance, but moved up the standings in the original dance, claiming the second silver medal. Michelle Kwan, an Olympic medalist in Nagano and Salt Lake, planned to compete in Turin, but pulled out due to a severe groin strain. Emily Hughes competed in place of Kwan.\nIndividual\nMixed\nFreestyle skiing.\nThe American freestyle skiing team in Turin boasted several medalists from previous Olympics, including 1998 aerials gold medalist Eric Bergoust. Two other skiers had won gold medals at the World Championships, Jeremy Bloom and Hannah Kearney. Despite this strong roster, the U.S. team won just a single medal in Turin, as Toby Dawson rose from 6th place in qualification to take bronze in the men's moguls. Kearney's failure to even advance from the qualifiers in the women's moguls was considering one of the team's disappointing performances.\nMen\nWomen\nIce hockey.\nThe U.S. men's team, which won a silver medal on home ice in Salt Lake City, had a poor start when they suffered a surprising 3–3 tie against Latvia. They did rebound with a win over Kazakhstan, but further losses to Slovakia, Sweden and Russia meant that the Americans finished fourth in their group, with the lowest point total of any team advancing to the medal round. In their quarterfinal against undefeated Finland, the Americans quickly fell behind 2–0, but managed to tie the game early in the second period. However, the Finns again took a two-goal lead later in the second, and while the Americans managed to score once more, they could not get closer than a 4–3 loss.\nThe women's team, also defending silver medalists, had a very strong round-robin showing, winning their three games by a combined score of 18–3. In the semifinals, the U.S. team played Sweden, with the Americans taking a 2–0 lead early in the second period. However, the Swedes then rallied, scoring twice to tie the game, and holding off the American attack and forcing a shootout to decide the game. Swedish goaltender Kim Martin stopped four American shooters, while Pernilla Winberg and Maria Rooth scored for Sweden. The American women bounced back from this loss in the bronze medal game, beating Finland 4–0.\nSummary\nMen's tournament.\nRoster\nGroup play\nQuarterfinal\nThe Roster for Men’s ice hockey is missing Bret Hedican, Defenseman\nWomen's tournament.\nRoster\nGroup play\nSemifinal\nBronze medal game\nLuge.\nTony Benshoof was in position to win America's first singles luge medal after the first two runs, but two slower efforts on the final two runs left him in fourth place. Courtney Zablocki had a similar story in the women's event, with a pair of slow runs dropping her well off the medal pace after being in contention for bronze early.\nMen\nWomen\nNordic combined.\nTodd Lodwick, who had the United States' best Nordic combined performance in Olympic history in Salt Lake City, finished in the top 10 in both individual events, with his 8th place in the Individual Gundersen the best showing for the U.S. in Turin.\nShort track speed skating.\nApolo Anton Ohno became the fourth US Winter Olympian to win three medals in a single games, taking gold in the 500 metres to go with two bronze medals. The only other American to make an 'A-Final' in Turin was Rusty Smith, who set an Olympic record time in the quarterfinals of the 1000 metres, but ended up fourth in the final.\nMen\nWomen\nSkeleton.\nZach Lund, considered the U.S.'s primary medal threat in the skeleton events, did not compete in the games after testing positive for finasteride. Lund contested the test at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but had his claim rejected. His ban was reduced from two years to one, but this still left in ineligible in Turin. In Lund's absence, the best finishes were a pair of 6ths, from Eric Bernotas and Katie Uhlaender in the men's and women's events, respectively.\nSki jumping.\nNo American ski jumper qualified for a final jump in Turin, though Alan Alborn advanced to the first round in both the large and normal hill events.\nSnowboarding.\nThe United States was the dominant nation in the Snowboarding events in Turin. The U.S. won seven medals, easily the most of any country, including three golds, from Shaun White and Hannah Teter in the men's and women's halfpipe and from Seth Wescott in men's snowboard cross. Lindsey Jacobellis was poised to give the Americans a fourth gold medal in the women's snowboard cross, but fell on the final hill while attempting a grab, was passed, and ended up with silver.\nFreestyle\nMen\nWomen\nParallel\nSnowboard cross\nSpeed skating.\nThree American men combined to win seven medals in Turin. This included three for Chad Hedrick, who entered the Games attempting to equal Eric Heiden's record of five gold medals. Hedrick won his first event, the 5000 metres, but when the men's pursuit team lost to Italy, his chances were dashed. He did not manage a second gold, but did win a silver and a bronze. Hedrick was the source of some controversy when he called out teammate Shani Davis, who skipped the team pursuit in order to prepare for his specialty, the 1000 metres. Davis won this event to become the first ever Winter Olympic individual gold medalist of African descent. The third medalist was Joey Cheek, who won gold in the 500 metres, and was chosen to carry the U.S. flag in the closing ceremonies.\nDistance\nMen\nWomen\nTeam Pursuit"

        "text": "Robert Oran Evans (born September 7, 1946) is an American college basketball coach. He was most recently the associate head coach with the University of North Texas. Evans served as head men's basketball coach at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) from 1992 to 1998 and Arizona State University from 1998 to 2006.\nEarly years.\nEvans was born in Hobbs, New Mexico, the son of Gladys (née Spirlin), a home cleaner, and Oscar, a preacher and janitor. Robert was the fourth of seven children, all of whom would go on to graduate college.\nEvans played high school basketball at Hobbs High School under legendary coach Ralph Tasker. His senior year he was named co-captain. That year the team made it to the 1964 championship game and Evans was invited to the state all-star game in Albuquerque.\nEvans played junior college basketball at what is now Lubbock Christian University where he was named the school's first All-American. Both seasons he played at Lubbock Christian Evans was voted the teams’ best defensive player. In his second year with the team Evans was named team captain. In 1966 Evans earned his associate degree in Arts and Sciences. At Lubbock Christian Evans was teammates with Gerald Turner who would later become Chancellor of the University of Mississippi. Turner was instrumental in Evans’ hiring as head basketball coach in 1992.\nEvans transferred to New Mexico State University for the 1966–67 season where he was coached by Lou Henson. He was named team captain and led the Aggies to a 15–11 record and an NCAA tournament appearance. The next season Evans again captained the team to a 23–6 record and another NCAA tournament appearance. In 1967 Evans was selected NMSU's most outstanding athlete. In May 1968 Evans earned his bachelor's degree in education.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his graduation, Evans was hired as an assistant at New Mexico State under Henson. When Henson left for Illinois in 1976, Evans moved to Texas Tech and served for 14 years as an assistant under Gerald Myers. After two years as an assistant at Oklahoma State under Eddie Sutton, Evans was hired at Ole Miss as its first black coach in a major sport.\nEvans inherited a program that had been one of the dregs of the Southeastern Conference for decades. The Rebels had not had a winning season in SEC play since 1982–83, and had only finished in the top half of the conference twice in 59 years of conference play. After four years rebuilding the program, the Rebels shocked the SEC by winning consecutive West Division titles in 1997 and 1998 and notching the first 20-win seasons in school history. Ole Miss had been one of the few longstanding members of a \"power conference\" to have never won 20 games in a season.\nIn 1998, Evans moved to Arizona State, which was reeling in the wake of a point-shaving scandal. His tenure at Arizona State was not nearly as successful as his tenure at Ole Miss, with only one NCAA appearance in eight seasons He was fired after the 2006 season."

        "text": "Patrick Thomas Murphy (born November 28, 1958) is an American baseball coach and manager who is the manager for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously served as the interim manager of the San Diego Padres and head coach for college baseball teams including Arizona State University and the University of Notre Dame.\nPlaying career.\nMurphy attended Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and played college baseball for the Florida Atlantic Owls as a catcher and infielder. He also pitched on occasion. He was honored on FAU's 20th Anniversary Team as a pitcher and utility player and in 2008 was inducted into the school's Baseball Hall of Fame.\nMurphy signed a professional baseball contract with the San Francisco Giants in 1982 and played four years in the minor leagues for the Giants, San Diego Padres, and two independent teams.\nCoaching career.\nCollegiate coaching.\nMurphy served as the head baseball coach and assistant football coach for the Maryville College Fighting Scots in 1983. In 1985, he was hired as head baseball coach and assistant football coach for the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags. He was hired by the University of Notre Dame as the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team on July 11, 1987. Murphy guided the Fighting Irish to a 318–116–1 (.732) record in South Bend, including consecutive trips to NCAA regional finals in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\nMurphy was hired by Arizona State University (ASU) as the head coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils baseball team in 1995. The Sun Devils won the Pac-10 Conference championship in 2000 and consecutive Pac-10 championships in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Twice in that same decade, Murphy had teams finish in the Top 3 in the country; a feat matched by only ten other schools. Murphy's ASU teams were consistently present in the national Top 25, including a streak of 100 consecutive weeks in the polls that lasted from 2000 until the middle of 2005. Murphy led the Sun Devils to the postseason for nine straight seasons and 11 of 12. His teams set an NCAA record of not being shut out in 506 consecutive games between 1995 and 2004, shattering the previous streak of 349.\nMurphy became the youngest collegiate coach to reach 500 career victories in 1998. In 1998, he won \"Baseball America\"s Coach of the Year award and was Pac-10 Coach of the Year four times (2000, 2007, 2008 and 2009). He led ASU to the College World Series four times (1998, 2005, 2007, 2009).\nOn November 20, 2009, Murphy resigned in the middle of an investigation of Arizona State's baseball program. It was initially reported that the resignation was his own decision. However, in December 2009, \"The Arizona Republic\" reported that on the day of his resignation, Murphy had been given an ultimatum: resign or be fired. The NCAA's investigation found Murphy innocent of violations regarding student-athlete employment and recruiting, reprimanding him solely for treating investigators with a \"cavalier attitude\". The Arizona State athletic department was faulted for lack of institutional control, however, resulting in the baseball program being sanctioned and banned from postseason play in the 2012 season, as ASU was a repeat offender. Murphy's career record at ASU was 629–284–1.\nSan Diego Padres (2010–2015).\nIn February 2010, Murphy was hired by the San Diego Padres as Special Assistant to Baseball Operations.\nMurphy skippered the Padres' Northwest League affiliate, the Eugene Emeralds, as their manager for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, as the Emeralds had consecutive league-best overall season records.

In 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers wanted to hire Murphy as a major league coach on Craig Counsell's coaching staff; Murphy coached Counsell at Notre Dame. The Padres refused to allow him to join the Brewers, even though it would constitute a promotion.\nOn June 16, 2015, Murphy was appointed interim manager of the San Diego Padres after then-manager Bud Black was fired. Immediately after the 2015 season, the Padres announced that Murphy would not return as manager.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2015–present).\nAfter the 2015 season, the Milwaukee Brewers hired Murphy as bench coach for Craig Counsell's coaching staff; Murphy was Counsell's coach during his playing career at Notre Dame. On June 11, 2023, Murphy filled in as manager for an absent Craig Counsell, who missed the game due to his son's graduation. The Brewers won the game 8–6.\nFollowing the 2023 season, Counsell accepted the managerial position for the Chicago Cubs. On November 16, 2023, the Brewers promoted Murphy to serve as their new manager.\nPersonal life.\nMurphy's daughter married Pedro Álvarez in 2011.\nMurphy had a heart attack at a team workout in July 2020.

        "text": "Formula 1 97 (known as Formula 1 Championship Edition in North America) is a racing video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It is the sequel to the 1996 video game \"Formula 1\" and was based on the 1997 Formula One World Championship. This was the last Formula One game to be made by the Bizarre Creations team, who moved on to create the successful \"Metropolis Street Racer\" for the Dreamcast and \"Project Gotham Racing\" for the Xbox.\nFeatures and gameplay.\n\"Formula 1 97\" includes all the tracks from the season, including the cancelled Portuguese Grand Prix circuit. Drivers are included with the exception of Williams F1 driver Jacques Villeneuve, who is missing due to copyright issues, and the MasterCard Lola duo of Ricardo Rosset and Vincenzo Sospiri, whose team folded after failing to qualify for the opening race of the season.\nThe game includes a Grand Prix mode, which was designed to be technical and realistic, and an arcade mode, which was aimed towards a broader audience.\n\"Formula 1 97\" supports two-player racing through a split screen.\nDevelopment.\n\"Formula 1 97\" was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis. It uses the same game engine as the original \"Formula 1\". Psygnosis contacted ITV commentator Murray Walker and arranged a meeting with Bizarre Creations employees. Walker became impressed with development and signed an exclusive agreement with Psygnosis to record English-language commentary for a further two years.\nShortly after the initial release, Psygnosis announced that due to a licensing disagreement with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, Formula One Administration Ltd, and Giss Licensing BV, \"Formula 1 97\" would be repackaged and re-released with a different title and without the official Formula One logos.\nReception.\n\"Formula 1 97\" was a best-seller in the UK. In August 1998, the game's PlayStation version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nReviews for \"Formula 1 97\" were overwhelmingly positive. \"IGN\" stated the game is a \"significant jump\" from \"Formula 1\". \"GameSpot\" said \"Formula 1 CE is so much more than a racing game. It is a world-class simulation that offers such depth of gameplay, you'll think most other racing games are just \"Pole Position\" with a better graphics engine.\" Critics widely applauded the comprehensive Formula 1 licensing, numerous car setup options, realistic sound effects, and overall authentic Formula 1 feel. At the same time, the majority were enthusiastic about the arcade mode, saying it both opens the game up to players other than simulation fanatics and offers simulation fanatics a more relaxed way of enjoying the game. \"GamePro\" dissented on this point, contending that the arcade mode's \"power-slide-heavy style feels almost silly and lacks the oomph to attract arcade gamers.\"\nCritics laid the most praise on the controls in the Grand Prix mode, commenting that they are maximally accurate, realistic, and challenging yet fair and rewarding. \"GamePro\" summed up, \"If you have the skills, they come shining through, but rookies will have a tough time staying on the track.\" Most critics were also highly satisfied with the varied A.I. displayed by different drivers, saying it makes racing unpredictable and forces the player to pay close attention and continuously adjust their strategy rather than relying on a single method of overcoming opponents.\nMost critics also praised the detailed graphics. While they also noted a good deal of pop-up, \"GameSpot\" argued this was a necessary trade-off for the game's combination of high detail and absence of slowdown, and Kelly Rickards argued in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"Ironically, [the pop-up] adds realism as it's difficult to see far away in a real F1 car at speed.\"\n\"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said it was a big improvement in every regard over the previous game, and that the \"graphics engine is faster, running at 25 fps, even with a dozen cars on the screen. The increased detail is most apparent in Grand Prix mode. All the cars are now fully deformable, and stray bits of debris stay on the track. Prepare to be stunned.\"\nLegal issues.\nThe game was hit by legal wranglings with the FIA (Formula One's governing body) objecting to the use of the FIA logo on the game's packaging. The game was withdrawn from shops six weeks after its release. It was re-released without the offending logo, but the FIA were still unhappy. However, the FIA lost the court case, and the game continued to be sold without the logo. Another problem faced was the use of the name and image of then-Williams F1-driver Jacques Villeneuve, after he had copyrighted both. The game shows a silhouette for the driver's image. Murray Walker refers to him as \"Williams Numberone\" or \"The Canadian\", however on the game menu, they list him as Driverone Williams; this problem is easily sidestepped by the addition of a driver name edit function. The game also has unused voice clips for Jacques Villeneuve, that can be found via hacking methods. This idea proved popular and re-appeared in \"Formula 1 98\", but was not used for any of the following games. The driver name edit function is also used to enter codes to unlock the Aida, Adelaide, Silverstone (1960s look), a mirrored version of the original game's bonus track, and others, such as raining frogs and the cars having the ability to hover.\nAll alcohol and tobacco sponsors are censored, for example trackside adverts saying Faster instead of Fosters, since such advertisements were illegal in some countries."

Visual Science were hired to make the game. The game was then rushed for release to coincide with the final race of the 1998 Formula One World Championship. As a result of this, the game ended up being very poorly-received by various gaming publications. Despite this, the game was a best-seller in the UK.\nCircuits.\nThe game features 16 official Formula One circuits based on the 1998 Formula One World Championship plus 2 hidden tracks which can be accessed with cheat codes. One is based upon a Hippodrome, although it says \"Coloseum\" in the selection screen and the other one is a Stunttrack.\nTeams and drivers.\nThe game features all of the official teams and drivers that competed in the 1998 Formula One World Championship, although like with its predecessor, \"Formula 1 97\", Jacques Villeneuve's name and image are not featured due to him copyrighting both. The game refers to him as 'Williams Driver 1'.\nReception.\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. \"PlayStation Power\" gave it a review of 69%, noting that \"Psygnosis have managed to cock up the one uncockupable licence on the PlayStation\" and that it was far worse than both \"F1 '97\" and the original F1 game on the PlayStation.\nIn February 1999, \"Formula 1 98\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland."

For 52 years from 1905 until his death, Ferguson acted as the scorer and baggageman for Australia, England, West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand in 43 tours and 208 Test matches.\nHe is often credited with two of the most revolutionary innovations in scoring. He developed the radial scoring chart, which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs. Originally called \"Ferguson's charts\", they are now popularly known as \"wagon-wheels\". He was one of the first scorers to use a linear system of scoring which, unlike the conventional system, keeps track of the balls faced by a batsman and off a particular bowler. In order to record such details, including the times of significant events during an innings, he designed his own scoring books – \"which contain[ed] at least twice as much information as any other in the world\" – and had them printed at his own expense. At the same time he also filled in a conventional scoring book for official use. He retained his own scoring books.\nHe received the British Empire Medal in 1951. He scored for the West Indian cricket team in England in 1957 at the beginning of the tour, but had to give up during the tour after a bad fall. He died at his home in Bath, Somerset, a few weeks later. He published his autobiography, \"Mr Cricket\", a few months before his death."

        "text": "Matthew Francis Doherty (born February 25, 1962) is an American former college basketball coach best known for his time as head coach of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team. Prior to accepting the head coaching position at UNC he spent one season as head coach of the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball program.\nAs a college player, Doherty started on the 1981–82 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, which on March 29, 1982, won the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, defeating the University of Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team by a score 63–62. At UNC, Doherty played under the legendary college coach Dean Smith, and started alongside future National Basketball Association stars James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Kenny Smith, Brad Daugherty and Michael Jordan.\nPrior to being named the head coach at Notre Dame, Doherty served as an assistant coach first at Davidson, then at Kansas. After leaving UNC, Doherty would go on to become head coach of the Florida Atlantic Owls, and the SMU Mustangs.\nOutside of coaching, Doherty has also served as a college basketball commentator and as an NBA scout. His broadcast roles have included serving as a color commentator for various high school and college programs including Davidson. Doherty was most recently was the Atlantic 10 Conference's associate commissioner for men's college basketball, resigning in April, 2019. Doherty went on to his current role as an executive coach, keynote speaker and author of the book REBOUND: From Pain to Passion - Leadership Lessons Learned.\nEarly years.\nDoherty was born in East Meadow, New York. In his teenage years, he went to high school at Holy Trinity DHS in Hicksville, New York. Bob McKillop was his coach during his first two years at Holy Trinity. Doherty was the first freshman to make the varsity team at Holy Trinity.\nDoherty was on the 1980 Holy Trinity team that won the Class A New York state high school boys basketball championship.\nWhile at Holy Trinity, Doherty was named to the second team of the \"Parade\" All-America Boys Basketball Team, in 1979. Doherty was also a McDonald's All-American, playing in the 1980 game.\nIn October 1979, Doherty committed to playing for the Tar Heels. Other schools tried to recruit Doherty before he could legally sign his letter of intent, but North Carolina basketball staffers checked on Doherty, calling and visiting him until he could sign his letter of intent.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season.\nDoherty was a reserve small forward during his freshman year. He played all but nine games in the first half of his freshman year because of a fractured left thumb. In the 28 games he played in his freshman year, Doherty had 67 assists and averaged six points and three rebounds per game. He played in the 1981 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game loss against Indiana.\nSophomore season.\nIn the summer of 1981, Doherty played on the South team in the National Sports Festival.\nDoherty didn't start during his freshman year in part because of Dean Smith's reluctance to start freshmen. By his sophomore year, Doherty was chosen as a starting forward. He appeared on the November 30, 1981 \"Sports Illustrated\" issue previewing the 1981–82 season, announcing that season's North Carolina team as the preseason number one team according to the AP Poll. Smith's other upperclassmen starters for that team--James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and Jimmy Black—also appeared on the cover with Smith. (Michael Jordan, one of Smith's few freshmen starters, was omitted from the cover because Smith didn't allow media coverage of freshmen players before they played their first game.)\nDoherty made 71 of his 92 free throw attempts, converting .772 percent of his free throws; his free throw percentage was the best of any player on the 1981-82 team. He also had 105 assists and averaged 9.3 points and three rebounds per game. Doherty scored at crucial points of North Carolina's postseason; he scored the three winning free-throws in North Carolina's victory against Virginia in the 1982 ACC men's basketball tournament, and he was one of the high scorers of the 1982 NCAA East Regional semifinal game against Alabama. He was also an ACC All-Tournament Second Team selection.\nJunior season.\nDoherty led the 1982–83 team in assists, with 150 assists. He averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Doherty was also named the team's most outstanding defensive player that season.\nIn the 1983 ACC men's basketball tournament quarterfinal against Clemson, Doherty scored 28 points, the most points he scored in an individual game during his college career. He made the ACC All-Tournament Second Team for the second consecutive year.\nSenior season.\nBefore his senior season, Doherty played on the 1983 United States Select team.\nDoherty was a co-captain of the 1983–84 team, along with Perkins and Cecil Exum. Doherty was also this team's assist leader, with 124 assists. He averaged 9.8 points and four rebounds per game.\nIn his last ACC Tournament in 1984, Doherty was named as an All-ACC Tournament First Team selection. He also was on the ACC All-Academic team.\nAt North Carolina, Doherty was a four-year letterman. Doherty was the second person in ACC history to earn 1,000 points, 400 rebounds, and 400 assists over a collegiate career. In the four seasons Doherty played with North Carolina, the Tar Heels amassed a record of 117 wins and 21 losses and won the 1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nDoherty was the 1984 recipient of the Jim Tatum Memorial Award, an award given by the Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that honors athletes who also participate in community activities.\nDoherty graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1984 with a degree in business administration.\nAfter college.\nAfter graduating from UNC-Chapel Hill, Doherty entered the 1984 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the sixth round, with the 119th overall pick. Doherty ended up being cut by the Cavaliers on September 25, 1984. Doherty never played in the NBA.\nDoherty wanted nothing to do with basketball after seeing getting cut. He worked as a bonds salesman on Wall Street for three years, but hated it. Doherty admitted to quitting his Wall Street job at the press conference held shortly after he was named head coach of Notre Dame.\nDoherty moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he worked as an executive search consultant. Around the same time, Doherty did color commentary for North Carolina, Davidson, St. Francis (NY), and high schools in the Charlotte area.\nAssistant coaching career.\nDoherty started his coaching career with a Charlotte-based Amateur Athletic Union team, coaching alongside former multi-sport Tar Heel athlete Charles Waddell. Doherty coached Jeff McInnis before McInnis came to UNC-Chapel Hill.\nIn 1989, Doherty was hired as an assistant basketball coach at Davidson, where McKillop was the head coach. Doherty was an assistant coach at Davidson for three seasons.\nIn 1992, Doherty became an assistant coach at Kansas under Roy Williams, who had been an assistant to Smith during Doherty's years at North Carolina. Doherty was at Kansas for seven years. During Doherty's time at Kansas, the Jayhawks won four Big 8 and Big 12 titles and advanced to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament every year. Doherty was an active recruiter during his time at Kansas. Several of the players he coached there went on to play in the NBA, including, but not limited to, Paul Pierce, Drew Gooden, and Kirk Hinrich. Other Kansas players talked about how Doherty recruited them to the press. In an interview with the \"Lawrence Journal-World\", T.J. Pugh mentioned that, on separate occasions, Doherty sent him a single match with the note \"We think you and KU are a perfect match\" as well as an air sickness bag with the note \"We'll be sick if you don't pick Kansas\" written on it. Raef LaFrentz, speaking to \"USA Today\", mentioned Doherty drew him a cartoon called \"Jayhawk Slammer,\" featuring a player dunking over several people.\nCoaching career.\nNotre Dame.\nOn March 30, 1999, Doherty was named as the head coach of Notre Dame men's basketball, less than a month after John MacLeod resigned. Doherty had several offers to become a head coach, but at the advice of Roy Williams and Dean Smith he waited until he found a great fit and he felt Notre Dame was a great fit for an Irish Catholic kid from New York.\nDoherty and his only Notre Dame team had hopes of reaching the 2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. But with a regular season record of 16–13 and a quarterfinal loss to Miami in the 2000 Big East men's basketball tournament, Doherty's Notre Dame team did not receive a bid for the NCAA tournament. Instead, they accepted an invitation to the 2000 National Invitation Tournament. Doherty's Notre Dame team reached the NIT finals, falling to Wake Forest. Doherty's Notre Dame team finished their season with a 22–15 record.\nNorth Carolina.\nFirst season.\nBill Guthridge decided to retire at the end of the 1999–2000 North Carolina basketball season, on June 30, 2000. North Carolina basketball staff interviewed Roy Williams for the head coaching job after Guthridge's retirement. Roy Williams was mistakenly named as head coach by the \"Herald-Sun\" of Durham, North Carolina, before he could decide on the North Carolina coaching job. Williams decided to stay at Kansas. Other coaches, including John Calipari, had interest in the coaching vacancy, but Guthridge and Smith insisted they were looking for a coach with ties to North Carolina's basketball program. George Karl, Larry Brown, Eddie Fogler, Jeff Lebo, and Randy Wiel, all North Carolina basketball alumni, applied for the vacancy. Karl, Brown, and Fogler later took their names out of consideration. Dick Baddour, then the athletic director of UNC-Chapel Hill, was set on hiring Doherty. Doherty was named head coach of North Carolina on July 11, 2000. Doherty decided to take the job after a phone call with Jordan earlier that day. Jordan told Doherty the North Carolina coaching job might go to someone who didn't play or coach at North Carolina.\nDoherty asked if he could bring his own staff from Notre Dame with him to North Carolina, a request greenlighted by North Carolina's athletic director. Doherty brought his assistant coaches--Doug Wojcik, Fred Quartlebaum, and Bob MacKinnon—and his coordinator of basketball operations, David Cason, with him from Notre Dame. Doherty felt he was rewarding the loyalty of the people that worked with him at Notre Dame, and felt Smith would have done the same thing. Instead, Smith and North Carolina basketball staff at that time were upset Doherty replaced Guthridge's assistant coaches Phil Ford, Dave Hanners, and Pat Sullivan. Ford, Hanners, and Sullivan not only played for North Carolina (unlike Doherty's Notre Dame coaching staff), they were also involved in recruiting players prior to Doherty's arrival. Doherty later felt he was misled by North Carolina basketball staff. However, some coaches applauded Doherty for retaining his Notre Dame coaching staff when he became North Carolina's head coach. Two of Doherty's four administrative staff left only to work with Dean Smith and Bill Guthridge. Doherty ended up releasing another administrative staff member due to lack of loyalty. These moves created dissension with the program.\nDoherty's first public appearance as North Carolina's head coach was at North Carolina's annual Midnight Madness event, then called \"Midnight with Matt and the Tar Heels.\" Doherty received a standing ovation when he walked into Carmichael Auditorium in the team's warm-up clothing and shoes. He participated in some of the event's activities, including a three-point shooting contest and a 3 on 3 contest between the coaching staff and champions from UNC-Chapel Hill's intramural basketball teams.\nDoherty's first season began with a game against Winthrop. Doherty also received a technical foul by marching on the court and stomping his feet, in an attempt to get his team's attention. Fans in attendance applauded Doherty's technical foul.\nDoherty apologized for a loss against Kentucky. After the Kentucky loss, the Tar Heels went on an 18-game winning streak. During this streak, the Tar Heels won the 2000 Hardee's Tournament of Champions, held in the Charlotte Coliseum. Doherty, not pleased with the first half of the game against UMass, threw a chair in the Tar Heels' locker room at halftime. At a post-game press conference, Doherty said he needed to buy a new chair to replace the one he threw in the locker room.\nCurry Kirkpatrick, covering Doherty for his February 12, 2001 column in \"ESPN The Magazine\", included a quote Doherty made in a team huddle during the February 1, 2001 game against Duke in Durham, in which he mused that Duke had \"the ugliest cheerleaders in the ACC.\" Doherty's comment did not spark outrage on Duke University's campus, but Doherty still issued an apology after the article came out.\nDoherty received a technical foul during the March 4, 2001 game against Duke in Chapel Hill. Doherty motioned for crowd noise after receiving the technical foul.\nDoherty's Tar Heels shared the 2000–01 ACC regular season title with Duke. Doherty was the first men's basketball coach to win a regular season championship title in the ACC in his first season. He was also the first coach to play for, and then coach, teams ranked number one in the AP Poll. After the regular season ended, Doherty was named the Associated Press's National Coach of the Year.\nThe Tar Heels made it to the final of the 2001 ACC men's basketball tournament, but lost in the final to Duke. Later, the Tar Heels won an at-large bid to the 2001 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, but were eliminated in the second round by Penn State. They finished their season with a 26–7 record. Michael Brooker, who was a fifth-year senior during Doherty's first year as North Carolina's head coach, blamed a collective feeling of hubris among the players as well as the players not listening to Doherty and his coaching staff for their losses toward the end of the season.\nSecond season.\nDoherty feared coaching his second season at North Carolina. Several of Doherty's best players from his first season were gone. The combination of the lack of depth and inexperienced freshmen in the back court resulted in the Tar Heels crumbling to a record of 8–20, the most losses in school history. It was North Carolina's first losing season since 1961–62, Smith's first year. They also suffered only their second losing record in ACC play at 4–12; the 12 losses were six more than they had previously suffered in conference play. They finished in a tie for seventh in conference play after never previously finishing worse than fourth (and 36 consecutive years of finishing no worse than third). They also missed postseason play altogether for the first time since 1967, including a then-record 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tournament.\nThe \"ACC Area Sports Journal\" published an article about Doherty after Boone's transfer. Sources close to the North Carolina basketball program, including then-current and former students, talked to the writer of the article, David Glenn, under anonymity. These sources felt Doherty could be a good coach, but Doherty's approach to his relationships between the players and himself needed to change. One source thought Doherty's coaching style wasn't constructive and his anger at various situations spilled over into his criticisms of players.\nThird season.\nDoherty's third season started with the Tar Heels winning the 2002 Preseason NIT, defeating Roy Williams' Kansas in the process. Their five win run was the best start to a season since the 1998–99 season. After a game against Iona, Sean May broke his foot. Several losses, including a five-game losing streak, followed May's injury.\nThe regular season ended with North Carolina's first win over Duke since 2001. During the game, held in Chapel Hill, Doherty was involved in an altercation with Chris Collins, then an assistant coach for Duke.\nShortly after the regular season ended, the \"ACC Sports Journal\" published another piece by Glenn centered on continuing problems between Doherty and his players. A parent of a player cited in the piece did not trust Doherty and believed other players did not trust Doherty as well. The mother of David Noel told the \"Star-News\" Noel did not have problems with Doherty, but she heard other players were having problems with Doherty.\nThe Tar Heels accepted an invitation to the 2003 NIT. They lost in the quarterfinal to Georgetown. The Tar Heels finished their season with 19 wins and a then-second-most program high of 16 losses. (This record has been surpassed by the 17 losses from the 2009–10 season, and the 19 losses from the 2019–20 season.)\nAfter the Georgetown loss, Baddour talked to the players and some parents. The meetings lasted five days. Reporters were stationed near the Smith Center for news about Doherty's future. In the meetings, six players told Baddour they were thinking about transferring. Baddour concluded he had no choice but to remove Doherty from his post.\nOn April 1, Doherty was told that he would not be allowed to return as head coach due to an irreparable rift with his players. A press conference was set for that day to announce his departure. Given the choice of resigning or being fired, Doherty chose to resign. The basketball staff had prepared announcements for a resignation or a firing, depending on Doherty's decision. While UNC basketball alumni were skeptical of Baddour's decision to give Doherty two options, but Baddour convinced them Doherty's job prospects and financial situation would look better if Doherty was given the choice to resign. His resignation was announced at North Carolina's scheduled press conference. Doherty did not attend the press conference. His contract was bought out for $337,500.\nIn an interview with Jones Angell and Adam Lucas for the \"Carolina Insider\" podcast, Steve Kirshner, the senior associate athletic director of UNC Athletics, says he allowed the players to come to the press conference announcing Doherty's resignation. However, Kirshner didn't realize the players that attended the press conference were wearing street clothes until just before the press conference started. Kirshner felt the players’ clothing was misinterpreted in the press, sparking rumors the players had no respect for Doherty and forced him to resign.\nThe day after the resignation, \"Inside Carolina\"'s Thad Williamson reported that UNC officials were very concerned about the lack of a respectful environment in the program. In part because of this, three scholarship players had transferred—an unusually high number for any college basketball program, especially for one of UNC's stature. Several more were threatening to leave if Doherty had been allowed to stay on. Doherty had reportedly been given a year to make things more harmonious if he wanted to keep his job.\nTwo days after his resignation, Doherty conducted an interview with Jay Bilas for ESPN. In the interview, Doherty stated his resignation was mishandled. Doherty claimed Baddour and his assistants failed to attend any of Doherty's practices. A spokesperson for UNC-Chapel Hill, speaking on behalf of Baddour, denied the claims. Jawad Williams defended Doherty after his resignation; he believed any collegiate basketball coach would have issues.\nDoherty considered going back to Davidson to become an assistant coach again. Instead, he took the following year off, talking to Brown, Rick Carlisle, Don Nelson, Gregg Popovich, Tom Izzo, and Tommy Amaker about their coaching methods. He went to the Wharton School of Business and wrote a thesis about his professional and personal life. He also took classes at the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration and the Bell Leadership Institute in Chapel Hill. While attending business school, Doherty also wrote a column for \"Sporting News\" and did color commentary for ESPN, College Sports Television, and Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television. He also worked part-time as a scout for the New York Knicks.\nAccusations by Rashad McCants.\nIn an interview with ESPN, Rashad McCants claimed Doherty knew about fake classes that kept McCants eligible to play at North Carolina. Doherty denied the accusations on his Twitter account.\nFlorida Atlantic.\nDoherty was named head basketball coach of the Florida Atlantic Owls on April 18, 2005, taking over from Sidney Green, who was fired over a month earlier. Doherty was the fifth coach in FAU's history and the last coach to coach while FAU was in the Atlantic Sun Conference.\nHurricane Wilma damaged FAU Arena and forced Doherty's Owls team to practice at Bishop Moore High School and the Champions Sport Complex in Orlando, Florida. However, the Owls' season began on time, with a 74–78 loss to Colgate.\nA one-hour reality show on Doherty's season with FAU, \"The Season: Florida Atlantic University\", first aired on ESPN2 on January 30, 2006.\nIn Doherty's one year at FAU, the Owls achieved their best-ever conference record (14–6) and its third season winning record in school history.\nWhile at FAU, Doherty appeared on the ESPNU show \"The U\" as a March Madness analyst.\nSMU.\nAfter Jimmy Tubbs was fired for NCAA violations, the athletics department at Southern Methodist University began a search for Tubbs' replacement. The committee chose Doherty because of his recruiting abilities and his concern for his student athletes. Doherty was named head men's basketball coach at SMU on April 24, 2006.\nWhile at SMU, Doherty held a lecture on his time as North Carolina's coach at the Cox School of Business, as a case study in business failure. He also assisted in fundraising and planning for Crum Basketball Center, a practice facility for the men's and women's basketball teams. The center opened in February 2008. Before Crum Basketball Center opened, Doherty held his practices in a church gym.\nTo generate interest in the basketball program, Doherty went to various fraternities and events on SMU's campus and hosted his weekly radio show at Ten Sports Grill in Downtown Dallas, off SMU's campus. He also started a blog, MustangHoopsBlog.com, which was hosted on SMU's athletics site. The idea to start the blog came from Mark Cuban.\nDoherty's first year at SMU had some setbacks. He lost his best player, Bryan Hopkins, to eligibility. He had enough time to sign only one of his prospects, Cameron Spencer. However, later that season, Doherty achieved his one hundredth career victory as a coach with a win against Texas-Pan American. Doherty ended his first season at SMU with a 14–17 overall record and 11–3 non-conference record.\nDoherty's fifth season with the Mustangs, in 2010–11, was his most successful season on the court. The Mustangs' 20–15 overall record was the first 20-win season the Mustangs had since 1999–2000. The Mustangs also accepted their first post-season bid in over a decade; they advanced to the semifinals of the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. They were defeated in the semifinals by eventual tournament champions Santa Clara.\nAfter a 13–19 record set during the 2011–12 season, Doherty was fired from SMU on March 13, 2012. His overall record at SMU was 80–109. None of his SMU teams made it past the first rounds of the Conference USA men's basketball tournament. According to \"The Dallas Morning News\", Doherty received $500,000 for the remaining year left on his contract. Doherty released a statement to the press, acknowledging he was let go because of his overall record at SMU.\nAfter coaching.\nDoherty was hired in October 2012 as a scout for the Indiana Pacers.\nIn 2013, Doherty called college basketball games for ESPNU and later appeared on \"Tournament Countdown: The Experts,\" part of ESPNU's post-season college basketball coverage.\nIn August 2017, Doherty was hired as the Atlantic 10 Conference's associate commissioner for men's basketball. He resigned in April 2019.\nPersonal life.\nWhile Doherty was coaching at Davidson, he married Kelly Propst. They have two children, Tucker (born 1997) and Hattie (born 1999). Tucker played lacrosse at Bellarmine University and Hattie attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she competed as a rower."

        "title": "Callaway Golf Company",
        "text": "Callaway, legally Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp., is an American global sports equipment manufacturing company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. The company also produces clothing through its subsidiary \"Callaway Apparel,” and golf shoes, through its \"Cuater\" subsidiary. In 2021, the company purchased Topgolf, and thus also operates a chain of golf-related amusement and events centers.\nThe company sells its products through golf retailers and sporting goods retailers, through mass merchants, directly online, and through its pre-owned and trade-in services. Callaway markets its products in more than 70 countries worldwide. The company, based in Carlsbad, California, is the world's largest manufacturer of golf clubs.\nIn past years, Callaway marketed products under the \"Toulon Design\" and \"Odyssey\" putter brand's, acquired in 1997, as well as \"Top Flite\", \"Strata\" and \"Ben Hogan\" brands picked up following the bankruptcy of Spalding's former golf division in 2003.\nHistory.\nCallaway Golf Company was founded by former Burlington Industries textile president, Ely Callaway Jr. Callaway was raised in LaGrange, Georgia, and was a graduate of Emory University. He had previously been successful in the textile and wine industries, and was also an avid golfer. Among his favorite club brands was Hickory Sticks USA, which was known for producing clubs with hickory shafts and steel cores. At that time, Hickory Sticks was owned by Richard Parente, Dick De La Cruz, and Tony Manzoni. When Hickory Sticks started running low on funds, they began seeking investors and approached Callaway, who had just sold his vineyards for a $9 million profit. In 1982, he bought half of Hickory Sticks USA and the company was renamed \"Callaway Hickory Stick USA.\" In 1983, he became the company's president and moved its headquarters to Carlsbad, California where he could be found selling clubs out of his Cadillac. In 1984, Callaway bought the rest of the company for another $400,000. The company's name was changed to its present name in 1988.\nIn 1985, the company hired Bruce Parker as head of sales, who later became the company's Chief Merchant and, through his tenure with Callaway Golf as head of sales, was responsible for sales in excess of $3.0 billion. He was involved in all major decisions during the company's growth.\nIn 1986, Callaway hired a billiard cue designer, Richard C. Helmstetter, as a consultant. Helmstetter was named chief club designer that same year and introduced computer-controlled manufacturing machines. With his help and that of Glenn Schmidt, the company's master tool maker, the company developed the original Big Bertha driver using large-volume (190cc) steel clubhead. The Big Bertha driver grew to 290 cc in 1997.\nIn 1996, the company hired Roger Cleveland as chief club designer and in 2002, launched the Callaway Golf Forged Wedges, constructed from carbon steel with modified U-grooved faces.\nIn 1996, Callaway announced development of a new golf ball, under the leadership of Chuck Yash, the former head of Taylormade Golf. Callaway Golf spent three years developing the ball and a state-of-the-art production facility. The company invested $170 million in research and development, and construction of the production facility.\nCallaway Golf Company engineers, recruited from Du Pont and Boeing, used aerodynamic computer programs (first used by Boeing and General Electric) to evaluate more than 300 dimple patterns and more than 1,000 variations of ball cores, boundary layers, and cover materials to create the new Rule 35 ball. They settled on only two versions of the Rule 35 ball—choosing to develop a \"complete-performance\" ball rather than separate balls developed for spin, control, distance, and durability. Ely Callaway explained the company's product development objectives as follows: \"We have combined all of the performance benefits into one ball so players no longer need to sacrifice control for distance, or feel, or durability. Each Rule 35 ball contains a unique synergy of distance, control, spin, feel and durability characteristics. This eliminates confusion and guesswork in trying to identify the golf ball that is right for each individual golfer.\"\nIn 1997, Odyssey Sports was acquired, expanding Callaway's line of putters. This led to introduction of the Odyssey White Hot putter line in 2000.\nEly Callaway resigned as CEO and president in 1996, remaining as chairman of the board. Donald H. Dye was named CEO and president. Callaway also continued as president and CEO of Callaway Golf Ball Company. In 1998 he again became president and CEO of Callaway Golf Company, but died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2001. Ron Drapeau assumed his positions.\nIn 2003, Drapeau announced the company's intention to purchase Top-Flite Golf and its Ben Hogan Golf division soon after Top-Flite Golf filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Due to competition from Adidas, the acquisition cost Callaway Golf $169 million.\nOn November 8, 2004, Callaway Golf named chairman and chief executive William C. Baker president and COO, replacing Patrice Hutin.\nIn August 2005, George Fellows was named president and CEO of Callaway Golf. He retained this position until June 2011.\nIn 2012, Oliver \"Chip\" Gordon Brewer III was named CEO of Callaway. Callaway sold the Top-Flite brand to Dick's Sporting Goods, citing declining sales, and the Ben Hogan brand to Perry Ellis International, with Callaway retaining several trademarks, including Apex and Edge.\nIn 2017, Callaway acquired OGIO, a US-based bag and apparel brand, and TravisMathew, a California-based lifestyle and golf apparel brand.\nIn 2019, Callaway acquired German outdoor apparel company Jack Wolfskin.\nIn 2020, Joe Flannery was named Executive Vice President of Callaway.\nOn October 27, 2020, Callaway announced it will acquire Topgolf Entertainment Group for $2 billion.\nOn August 24, 2022, Callaway Golf Company announced plans to change its corporate name to Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp.\nEffective September 7, 2022, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. changed its ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange from \"ELY\" to \"MODG\".\nFinancial.\nIn February 1992, Callaway Golf went public on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of $250 million. By late 1997, it reached a market capitalization of over $3.0 billion.\nEndorsements.\nCallaway has maintained endorsement deals with many professional golfers who play on the world's leading tours, including Jon Rahm, Xander Schauffele, Sam Burns, Chris Kirk, Akshay Bhatia, Min Woo Lee, Danny Willett and Francesco Molinari. \nThey have also had commercial relationships with some of the legends of the sport including Arnold Palmer and Annika Sörenstam, and celebrities such as Justin Timberlake and Stephen Curry. After being endorsed by Callaway late in his career, Seve Ballesteros expressed his gratitude to Ely Callaway by giving him a vintage Rolex, one he had worn since he first signed with the watchmaker.\nAwards.\nOn December 8, 2005, Callaway Golf received the 2005 Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics, from the San Diego Better Business Bureau."

        "title": "Joe Smith (basketball)",
        "text": "Joseph Leynard Smith (born July 26, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player. A power forward, he played for 12 teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) during his 16-year career.\nBorn and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, Smith was the College Player of the Year at Maryland in 1995 and the No. 1 pick of that season's NBA draft, picked by the Golden State Warriors. He was named to the 1995–96 All-Rookie team. Smith was mobile throughout his career, as he was one of the most traded players in league history. In 1998, Smith was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers; he then played for the Minnesota Timberwolves (with a midway pitstop for the Detroit Pistons) until 2003. He later played for the Milwaukee Bucks, the Denver Nuggets, the 76ers again, the Chicago Bulls, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Atlanta Hawks, the New Jersey Nets, and the Los Angeles Lakers. Smith was on the active roster of 12 different teams, which was an NBA record shared with Jim Jackson, Tony Massenburg, Chucky Brown, and Ish Smith; until Ish played with the Denver Nuggets, his 13th team, in the 2022–23 season.\nSmith attended Maury High School and played at the University of Maryland.\nCollegiate career.\nSmith played for Maryland for two seasons. As a sophomore, Smith averaged 20.8 points and 10.6 rebounds a game, and was named to the AP NCAA All-America Team. On March 2, 1995, Smith scored a collegiate career high 40 points and made a game winning tip in shot during a 94-92 victory over Duke.\nNBA career.\nGolden State Warriors (1995–1998).\nIn the 1995 NBA draft, Smith was selected by the Golden State Warriors as the first overall pick, before fellow power forwards Kevin Garnett, Antonio McDyess and Rasheed Wallace, as well as guard Jerry Stackhouse. On November 30, 1995, Smith scored his highest single game point total of his rookie season, with 30 points in a 125-121 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On January 20, 1996, Smith grabbed a career high 20 rebounds, while also scoring 21 points, during a 110-102 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. At the end of the year, after starting all 82 games, Smith was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 1995–96 season and finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting to Damon Stoudamire and Arvydas Sabonis.\nThe following season, Smith would average a career best 18.7 points per game, second on the team only to Latrell Sprewell's 24.2 points per game. On January 8, 1997, Smith scored a career high 38 points in a 109-95 loss to the Vancouver Grizzlies. For the second season in a row, however, the Warriors would again miss the postseason, this time with a 30-52 record.\nSmith would play years for the Warriors before being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Brian Shaw for Clarence Weatherspoon and Jim Jackson midway through the 1997–98 season. The trade was engineered by Golden State as Smith had made clear his desire to return to the east coast, and he was approaching free agency (halfway through the final year of his 3-year rookie contract). Smith turned down a multi year $80+ million contract with the Warriors. He made a reported $61 million over his career.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (1999–2001).\nDespite a drop in production, Smith was seen still as a hot commodity in the free agency blitz that followed the strike in lockout 1998. In what seemed at the time like a bizarre move, Smith signed for very little money with the Minnesota Timberwolves. For the next two years, Smith played very productively at small forward alongside All-Star Kevin Garnett.\nTimberwolves salary cap scandal.\nFollowing the 1999–2000 season, it was discovered that Smith was involved in a salary cap-evading scandal involving Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor and general manager Kevin McHale. Smith was allegedly promised a future multimillion-dollar deal if he signed with the team for below market value, allowing the team to make some additional player moves in the short term. As part of the deal, Smith signed three one-year contracts for less than $3 million apiece, allowing the Timberwolves to retain his \"Bird rights\" and exceed the cap to re-sign him. At the end of the last one-year contract, Smith could have signed a new long-term contract that would have paid as much as $86 million.\nThe beginning of the end for the illicit deal came when Smith's agent, Andrew Miller, left the sports marketing firm helmed by Eric Fleisher and retained Smith and Garnett as clients. Fleisher sued, and details of the illegal contract came to light in discovery. NBA Commissioner David Stern severely punished the Timberwolves in response. He fined the team $3.5 million and voided all three short-term contracts—and with them, Smith's \"Bird rights.\" He also barred Taylor from having any role in the Timberwolves' operations until August 31, 2001, and forced McHale to take an unpaid leave of absence through July 31, 2001. More seriously in the long run, Stern stripped the Timberwolves of their first-round draft picks in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (though the 2003 and 2005 picks were ultimately returned).\nThe team still found success, culminating in 2004 when the Timberwolves finished with the best record in the Western Conference, and advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals.\nDetroit Pistons (2000–2001).\nJoe Smith was released by the Timberwolves and signed with the Detroit Pistons for the 2000–01 season as a backup. Smith produced good numbers for the Pistons and, at the end of the season, he re-signed with his former team the Timberwolves where he played for two more seasons until the end of the 2002-03 NBA season.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2003–2006).\nIn 2003, Smith and teammate Anthony Peeler were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Sam Cassell and Ervin Johnson. Smith spent three seasons with the Bucks. During the 2004 NBA Playoffs, Smith averaged postseason career highs of 13.2 points and 10 rebounds per game during a 4-1 first round loss to the Pistons.\nNBA journeyman (2007–2011).\nPrior to the 2006–07 season, Smith was traded to the Nuggets for Ruben Patterson, where he only played in 11 games before being traded, along with Andre Miller, back to the 76ers for former teammate Allen Iverson. Despite being considered an add-in on the deal, Smith averaged over 25 minutes per game with the 76ers, during the team's ultimately unsuccessful second-half battle to make the playoffs. For the 2007–08 season, Smith signed with the Chicago Bulls. Smith averaged over 11 points and 5 rebounds per game for the Bulls, but the team managed only 33 wins the whole season. Smith was traded in a three-team deal at the trade deadline to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nOn August 13, 2008, Smith was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team, six-player deal involving the Thunder, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Cleveland Cavaliers that sent Milwaukee's Mo Williams to Cleveland, Smith and Milwaukee's Desmond Mason to Oklahoma City, and Cleveland's Damon Jones and Oklahoma City's Luke Ridnour and Adrian Griffin to Milwaukee.\nThe Thunder traded Smith to the New Orleans Hornets along with Chris Wilcox and draft rights to DeVon Hardin on February 17, 2009 for Tyson Chandler but on February 18, 2009 the trade was rescinded after Chandler failed a physical with Oklahoma City.\nOn March 1, 2009, the Thunder bought out the remainder of Smith's contract and released him. Two nights later, he agreed to terms to rejoin the Cavaliers.\nOn August 25, 2009, he signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Hawks. On March 17, 2010, Smith became the 92nd player in NBA history to reach 1,000 games played, in a victory over the New Jersey Nets.\nOn September 10, 2010, Smith signed a deal with the New Jersey Nets.\nOn December 15, 2010, Smith was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-team trade involving the Nets and Houston Rockets. On January 2, 2011, Smith made his debut for the Lakers. Two days later, he scored his first points as a member of the team.\nCoaching career.\nSmith wound up participating in one of the Phoenix Suns' pre-draft practices on June 9, 2015 as someone to help out center Alex Len during practice. He was initially considered a candidate to take on one of the Suns' player development coaching roles, but he was ultimately not hired for the position.\nSmith continues to coach in the greater Atlanta area with the private coaching service, CoachUp.\nMusic career.\nSmith has recorded a solo rap album under the pseudonym 'Joe Beast'. Included on the album are tracks titled \"Murda Kapital\" and \"I Does This\". The album was produced in Oklahoma City, by Tommy Switch and Lorin Roberts, while Smith was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder."

He was best known for his role as Tarzan in the 1960s trilogy and as Junior in the \"Smokey and the Bandit\" trilogy.\nFootball career.\nHenry attended Bell High School in Los Angeles, where his play caught the attention of USC Trojans alum John Ferraro, who arranged for him to get a tryout at USC. He attended USC and was co-captain of the 1957 USC Trojans football team.\nActing career.\nHenry's most prominent role was as Tarzan in three 1960s movies \"Tarzan and the Valley of Gold\" (1966), \"Tarzan and the Great River\" (1967), and \"Tarzan and the Jungle Boy\" (1968) that were all filmed back-to-back in 1965. At the time, critics said the dark-haired, square-jawed, muscular Henry resembled classic illustrations of the apeman more than any other actor who had taken on the role. Henry turned down the lead of the subsequent \"Tarzan\" television series, which then went to Ron Ely.\nHenry is probably best known to movie audiences for playing Jackie Gleason's character's dim-witted son \"Junior\" in the highly popular \"Smokey and the Bandit\" comedies, starring Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.\nHenry portrayed a corrupt prison guard in \"The Longest Yard\" (1974). Henry played Sergeant Kowalski in \"The Green Berets\" (1968), Luke Santee in \"More Dead Than Alive\" (1968), and corrupt Sheriff \"Blue Tom\" Hendricks in \"Rio Lobo\" (1970). He also acted with Charlton Heston in three films: the football movie \"Number One\" (1969), \"Skyjacked\" (1972), and \"Soylent Green\" (1973).\nHenry played Lt. Col. Donald Penobscot in an episode of the television series \"M*A*S*H\". In another football-oriented role, he portrayed Tatashore, one of the members of the gang who kidnap Larry Bronco (Larry Csonka) in the \"One of Our Running Backs Is Missing\" episode of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\".\nPersonal life.\nHenry and his wife Cheryl Henry, were married in 1984. Together they had a daughter, Shannon Noble.\nIllness and death.\nAfter being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he retired from acting in 1988. Henry died on January 8, 2021, at the age of 84 at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, after years of complications from both Parkinson's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."

        "title": "Swimming machine",
        "text": "A swimming machine, also known as a resistance swimming apparatus], is a self-contained device powered by a pump, designed to facilitate stationary swimming for athletes or recreational users. This can be achieved by either propelling water past the swimmer or providing support for the swimmer, either within a water environment or on dry land.\nThere are multiple variants of a swimming machine including countercurrent machines, hybrid systems, pressure-driven machines, swim spas, and volume driven machines.\nHistory.\nCounter current swimming machines made their appearance in the 1970s. The world's first swimming machine was completed in the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen in East Berlin in 1976. It was used by the top athletes of East Germany. Initially, swimming machines were made in the form of pump-driven jetted streams, but received criticism since they created turbulence and an unnatural swimming environment. They were followed up in the 1980s by a propeller-and paddle-wheel-driven machines. These provided a smoother stream of water, thus a more natural swimming experience, and were more popular among consumers.\nHybrid Systems.\nHybrid systems are another strand of swimming machines available. They feature self-contained micro pools similar to the counter-current type but use a flexible tether to keep the swimmer in place and help the swimmer from hitting the side of their exercise area. These systems, being human-powered, need neither machinery nor electricity but have to be carefully designed to suppress wave formation. The second type allows a person to remain on dry land while simulating certain swimming strokes. Machines of the latter type, however, can not compensate for the weight of the body and the limbs and thus deprive the user of the benefits of exercise in an aquatic environment. However, the higher effort required by such machines, in the absence of the metabolic effects of immersing the body in water, makes these devices more effective than true swimming if one's purpose is to achieve weight reduction. Similar in purpose, but not qualifying as \"swimming machines\" since they require access to a swimming pool, are various tether systems. Resistance Swim Spas beat the current stainless steel swim spas.\nPressure-driven machines.\nPressure-driven swimming machines depend on one or more pumps. Discharge rates of 13 L/s (200 US gal/min) and more are possible, from motors of three or four horsepower (2 or 3 kW); power requirements are determined from pump curves, where the pump is selected to Ś volumetric flow, as pressure loss is relatively low as the water does not need to be lifted, but only overcome swimmer drag and other pressure losses within the system. One of the earliest models on the market, introduced in 1973, was the Badujet which is available only in the form of a bare propulsion system, to be installed into either an existing or newly built pool.\nAlso in this category of pressure-driven swimming machines are a number of swim spas, usually, fibreglass shells equipped with several pool pumps to set the water in motion. Seen as more convenient since they come pre-assembled, the quality of the swim has been criticized by indoor swimmers as being somewhat turbulent, as the strength of the current comes from the speed and pressure of the discharged water, rather than its volume. Contrary to this, triathletes and other sea swimmers have praised the system due to the turbulence created by the jets mimicking the behaviour of the sea, improving stamina and general fitness, and preparing them for unpredictable conditions they may face whilst they compete.\nSwim Spas, as the name suggests, are a combination of a spa (or hot tub) and an exercise pool. Single-zone models are typically a fibreglass pressure-driven exercise pool which has swim jets at one end, and one or more spa seats fitted with massage jets at the other. Swimmers and athletes have praised the integration of both a hot tub and swimming machine model since they can use it for exercising and recreational purposes.\nIn the 1980s, Monarch Spas developed the dual-zone swim spa, allowing the pumps and other equipment needed for the pool to also power a separate spa. One advantage of the modern dual-zone system is the ability to set different temperatures and use different chemicals in each pool area. The hot tub section can utilize bromine and provide a relaxing and therapeutic experience, while the swim zone can be kept cool for strenuous exercise using chlorine.\nVolume-driven machines.\nIn the 1980s, a new type of machine made its appearance. In an attempt to correct problems of turbulence and resulting discomfort from swimming against a jet of water, systems were devised to set the water in motion in a smoother fashion. The first, in 1984, was the SwimEx, developed by Stan Charren together with two MIT-trained engineers. This machine, consisting of a fiberglass pool with the machinery housed in an adjacent compartment, sets the water in motion by means of a paddlewheel and generates a steady stream of water as wide as the swimming pool itself.\nIn the late 1980s, the Endless Pool was developed by James Murdock. This machine places the water-moving equipment, a large propeller encased in a stainless steel box and powered by a remote hydraulic pump, and its stainless steel water circulation tunnels, inside the body of a vinyl-lined metal pool. Its stream of water is narrower than that of the \"SwimEx,\" though the swimming experience is comparable and equally smooth. Other companies have copied this system since it was introduced.\nAround the same time, the \"Swim Gym,\" a propeller-driven propulsion system became commercially available. The \"Swim Gym\" machine is encased within a large (10\" diameter) PVC tee which is then incorporated into the concrete wall of a swimming pool. It delivers a current equivalent to that produced by \"Endless Pools.\"\nIn 2008, SmartPools Sdn Bhd Malaysia launched its Laminar Propulsion system using drive train technology capable of moving up to 30,000 litres of water per minute at low pressure to create a non-turbulent, bubble-free, smooth flow and speed-adjustable swimming treadmill.\nHybrid Still Water Mini-Pools.\nA number of \"still-water\" mini-pools have been built, designed to be used in conjunction with various resistance-swimming tether systems. These human-powered devices combine the self-contained aspect of counter-current swimming machines with the lower priced and simplicity and freedom of movement of tether systems used in athletic training. They have major cost and energy-use advantages over mechanical swimming machines. They are often used for aerobic exercise, endurance and strength training, and for stroke practice. However, they cannot replicate open water conditions, in which the water courses at speed past the swimmer, so that for competition training their use has to be combined with open-water practice. One example of such a device is the \"Swimergy Swim System\", which also makes use of wave-reduction technology. \nEnergy Efficiency.\nSwim spas have significantly improved in energy efficiency, thanks in part to manufacturers like Wellis, who have pioneered eco-friendly innovations. Wellis swim spas feature advanced Scandinavian Insulation, efficient LED lighting, and a Smart Control System, allowing for remote adjustments. These innovations not only reduce energy consumption but also offer users convenience and lower operational costs, positioning Wellis at the forefront of sustainable swim spa technology."

        "title": "London United (basketball)",
        "text": "London United is basketball team from London, England, currently competing in English Basketball League Division 2. In 2006 they were elected into the professional British Basketball League to replace the London Towers as the sole representatives for the capital city. However, after achieving a Play-off place in their first season, the franchise fell into a financial crisis and withdrew but continued to field a team in the lower leagues of the English Basketball League.\nFranchise history.\nThe beginning.\nLondon United basketball club was formed in 2002 following a merger between two local teams, the Ealing Tornados and the North London Lords. Ealing Tornados were themselves a very successful team in the lower leagues, having won promotion after promotion since their foundation in 1999. When the merger took place at the end of the 2001–02 season, Ealing Tornados had just finished as runners-up in NBL Division 1 (Now known as EBL Division 2) behind the Derbyshire Arrows.\nFurther successes.\nPlaying as London United, the successes continued with promotion to EBL Division 1 achieved just a year later, in 2003. United spent 3 years in Division 1 with their biggest success coming in 2004-05 when they finished as runners-up, again pipped to the title by the Arrows. The logical progression for the club was to join the fully professional British Basketball League in July 2006. However the decision was hastened when the London Towers withdrew from the 2006-07 season, leaving London without a professional basketball team.\nThe big step up.\nFor owners Jack Majewski and David Schiller, the step-up meant finding a new venue, as well as recruiting more able players and finding corporate investments to fund the venture into the BBL. Jacks first step was to hire coach Tony Garbelotto to control the team on-court and bring in Chris Morris (who works closely with Tony Garbelotto running the highly successful Hackney Community College Basketball Academy programme based at SPACe) to run off-court operations. Majewski, Schiller, Garbelotto and Morris are the Club Directors. Sponsorship soon came, in the way of international money transferors MoneyGram, and a suitable venue was found at the Space Centre near Hackney. A mass influx of British players strengthened the ranks of United, with major signings including internationals Chris Haslam and Tarick Johnson.\n2006/07.\nLondon played their first BBL game on 30 September 2006 on the road at Leicester Riders. Despite trailing 73–52 at the end of the third quarter, a last gasp effort and a 29–6 run resulted in an 81–79 victory for the rookies. United's successful start to the 2006-07 season continued with another road victory one week later against veterans the Scottish Rocks, who were defeated 76–70. London United finished the 06/07 season qualifying for the BBL Play-Offs in 8th place with an 11/25 record. Here, they were defeated narrowly by BBL Champions Guildford Heat. Tarick Johnson finished as the BBL's top-scorer with over 800pts at an average of 23 per game. Johnson was also voted by BBL coaches into the BBL \"All-Star\" Team of the season.\n2007-present.\nIt was announced on 5 September 2007, just two weeks prior to the new season tipping-off, that London United's directors and the BBL had agreed to withdraw from the upcoming campaign. The Press Release stated that United's headline sponsor, MoneyGram, had endured financial difficulties of their own and were forced to withdraw their sponsorship. Without enough funds to compete, the club had no option but to 'park' the franchise for a year and work towards a return to the league for 2008–09. Following the shock announcement, the league was promptly reduced to 12 teams for the upcoming season, with rookies London Capital acting as the flagship for London basketball.\nHowever, this setback did not wipe out the London United brand from the London basketball landscape. London United Basketball re-established itself at Richmond upon Thames College in order to concentrate on developing young elite basketball players and subsequently joined forces with Spelthorne Atoms Junior Basketball Club to create an extensive Junior Programme under the London United Basketball Club umbrella which enabled the Club to reach all age groups from Under 10s through to Senior Level.\nIn the last two years London United won promotion in two consecutive seasons and is now playing in England Basketball League Division Two. On top of this, in 2010 the Men's team also won the National Shield.\nSeason-by-season records.\nNotes:"

        "text": "Three cities made the shortlist with their bids to host the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (also known as \"XXI Olympic Winter Games\" and the \"X Paralympic Winter Games\"), which were awarded to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on July 2, 2003. The other shortlisted cities were Pyeongchang and Salzburg. Although Bern was originally shortlisted along with Vancouver, Pyeongchang and Salzburg, a referendum held in September 2002 revealed that a majority of the citizens of Bern did not support pursuing the candidacy. There were four other cities vying for the hosting honour, that had been dropped by the International Olympic Committee: Andorra la Vella, Harbin, Jaca and Sarajevo.\nVancouver won the bidding process to host the Olympics by a vote of the International Olympic Committee on July 2, 2003 at the 115th IOC Session held in Prague, Czech Republic. Earlier in February, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games. In neighboring Washington state to the south, both the state legislature and Governor Gary Locke passed a resolution in support of Vancouver's bid, and sent it to the IOC.\nBidding process.\nEight cities applied to host the games. Those cities were (in the order of drawing the lots):\nEach city was required to answer a twenty-two question questionnaire.\nEvaluation.\nThe IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group, which evaluated the applications divided their recommendations into eleven areas.\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\nFour cities were named Candidate Cities: Bern, Pyeongchang (which both met the benchmark), Salzburg, and Vancouver (which both exceeded it). They made additional comments with respect to Bern and Pyeongchang. As for Bern, they felt the bid had significant organizational difficulties and the financial plan's feasibility was dependent on a popular referendum. As for Pyeongchang, the resort area of Yongpyong required further development.\nIn September, a referendum ended Bern's chances of winning.\nEach candidate city was required to answer a 199-question questionnaire.\nAfter the withdrawal of Bern, the IOC Evaluation Commission visited the three remaining cities on the following dates:\nElection.\nThere were two rounds of voting at the convention that decided which city would host the games. In the first round Pyeongchang received 51 votes, while Vancouver received 40 and Salzburg with only 26 votes, thus eliminating them in the first round. In the second and final round of voting, Vancouver received 56 votes to Pyeongchang's 53, which proved to be the difference in margin of victory and the closest vote for an Olympic city host since Sydney, Australia beat Beijing, China by 2 votes for the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nAcross Canada, and especially in the province of British Columbia, celebrations broke out amidst the announcement made by IOC President Jacques Rogge, as evidenced on the CBC, by the network's chief correspondent, Peter Mansbridge. While Vancouver and the rest of British Columbia celebrated, the mood was bittersweet in Toronto which had aspirations to host the 2012 Summer Olympics which were awarded to London. Canada's largest city has already lost bids to host the 1996 and 2008 Summer Olympics to Atlanta and Beijing. The announcement came the day after Canada celebrated its 136th anniversary, with Canada Day. With ice hockey being their pastime, some of the people at GM Place said that winning an Olympic Games is far greater than winning a Stanley Cup when they heard the announcement. Wayne Gretzky made this evident in Prague, as he served as an ambassador and contributor to the games and was part of the presentation team."

        "title": "Steve Roach (rugby league)",
        "text": "Stephen David Roach (born 24 April 1962), nicknamed Blocker or Blocker Roach, is an Australian former professional rugby league who played as a prop forward in the 1980s and early 1990s. His most famous catchphrase is \"Big Boppa\".\nHe made thirty-nine representative appearances for the Australian national team in Tests, World Cup and New South Wales State of Origin matches between 1985 and 1991. His football career was followed by a period as a commentator.\nBackground.\nRoach was born in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.\nClub career.\nRoach played his early rugby league for Wests Illawarra and was signed by the Balmain Tigers in 1982. He quickly advanced to first grade and in 1983 was part of the Balmain side which made the semi-finals for the first time since 1977. Between then and 1992 Roach played 185 first grade games for the Tigers. 1987 was almost completely wiped out for Roach due to a serious knee injury and though he returned to excellent form in 1988 he was cited for a tackle on Penrith's Chris Mortimer suspended for four weeks, missing the 1988 finals including the Grand Final loss to Canterbury. \nIn the 1989 club season his combination with Paul Sironen, Benny Elias and Wayne Pearce was one of the strongest packs in club rugby league history and the side dominated opposing forwards. In the 1989 Grand Final, after having led Canberra 12 points to 2 at half-time, the Tigers were run down. Roach and Sironen were replaced by coach Warren Ryan late in the 2nd half and when the game ultimately went into extra time they were unable to return and with their strikepower gone in the added period Canberra were able to overpower Balmain 19–14. In 1991 his club form showed some decline but he again managed national selection and his experience was vital to the improvement of a side needing reorganisation after they suffered a shocking start to the club season. After an ankle injury in 1991 he was also troubled by a knee injury in 1992 which would prove to be his last club season. \nRepresentative career.\nState representative honours first came his way in 1984 when he was called into the New South Wales Blues side for all three games of that year's State of Origin series. Thereafter barring injury (which ruled him out of the 1987 series) and his surprise omission in 1989 (which saw NSW suffer their second straight 3–0 defeat by Queensland), he was generally a regular Blues starter and he made 17 State of Origin appearances until Game 2 of the 1991 series. When Jack Gibson was New South Wales coach in 1989 and 1990, he reportedly threatened the NSWRL with resignation from the position if Roach was selected in the side, though the Balmain front rower was selected in 1990 and went on to win their first series since their 3–0 win in 1986.\nIn 1985, Roach became the 562nd player to represent Australia when he made his national representative début in the first Test in Brisbane against New Zealand. His excellent club form for Balmain in 1986 ensured his place on the 1986 Kangaroo tour where he appeared in two Tests and seven minor tour matches, though his tour was interrupted after he suffered a dislocated elbow in a match against St. Helens before the second Ashes test against Great Britain.\nCitations and despatches to the sin-bin in the 1989 club season may have contributed to his omission by State selectors from the Blues squad of that year however powerful club performances with his fellow representative Balmain forwards made him a certainty for the 1989 New Zealand tour where he played in all three Tests. On the 1990 Kangaroo tour Roach played in all five Tests against Great Britain and France and in five other minor tour games. In a Test match against New Zealand in Melbourne in 1991, Roach clashed famously with Kiwi forward Dean Lonergan and required 20 stitches. Early in the game the Kiwi forward had attempted a tackle on Roach but the pair accidentally clashed heads, leaving Roach requiring stitches and Lonergan convulsing on the ground, though both would return to the game.\nBlocker was dropped after the Australian's shock 24–8 loss to NZ in the Melbourne test but was chosen for the end of season tour of Papua New Guinea.. However, Roach suffered a broken ankle in the first match of the tour which would prove to be his last appearance in any game for the Kangaroos\nPlaying style.\nIn a game in 1990 against Manly at Brookvale Oval, he received a four-week suspension for backchatting the referee Eddie Ward, whom Roach patronisingly patted on the head after he was ordered from the field. Coming into physical contact with a referee is regarded as a serious offence and Roach was considered fortunate that no further action was taken, especially considering Roach had also verbally abused the touch judge on his way off the field, calling him a “(expletive) wombat\".\nPost-playing life.\nBy the end of the 1992 season Roach had written an autobiography, \"Doing My Block\" and he became a commentator with the Nine Network as well as making appearances on \"The NRL Footy Show\". After a disagreement with fellow Channel 9 commentators Paul Vautin and Peter Sterling he was sacked by the network and signed by the official rugby league radio broadcaster 2UE, before later moving to 2GB with Ray Hadley and his Continuous Call Team. He has made further television appearances on the Seven Network's \"Sportsworld\" and is one of a number of former players who appear in radio, TV and print ads for the Lowes menswear chain. After a 3-year stint as assistant coach with Manly, Roach was appointed to the coaching committee of his beloved Tigers – now the Wests Tigers. \nOn 23 June 2000, Roach was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league.\nIn February 2008, Steve Roach was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nIn 2011 Roach joined Network Ten's new Thursday night Rugby League show \"The Game Plan\".\nIn 2014, Roach was sacked by 2GB after a staff member filed a bullying complaint against him.\nIn 2016 he made a comeback to the Rugby League commentary box signing on with Fox Sports.\nIn 2018, Roach revealed that his nickname 'Blocker' actually came from his time employed as a Licensed Plumber where it was remarked by his colleagues that he would 'block' pipes that would subsequently require plumbing works to be conducted.\nIn 2019, he appeared regularly on Fox Sports panel show, 'Controversy Corner', as well as commentating for the network."

        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines swimming and diving teams represent the University of Michigan in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Swimming and Diving Championships. The men's and women's teams, which had been coached separately, were combined in August 2012 by the University of Michigan Athletic Department.\nThe program has won 12 NCAA Championships, the second-most in history, as well as 58 Big Ten Championships. It has produced 399 All-Americans, and 107 Olympians have been affiliated with the program.\nMen's swimming and diving.\nHistory.\nThe University of Michigan Men's Swimming and Diving team has a rich tradition of producing quality swimmers and being one of the nation's top programs. Men's swimming and diving has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1921. With 19 total national championships — 12 official NCAA championships and seven unofficial NCAA national championships — the Michigan men's swimming and diving team has won more national championships than any other varsity sport in the history of the university. In addition, Michigan holds 42 Big Ten Titles in its history with its most recent title coming in the 2020–21 season. The team has won more Big Ten titles than any other program. Michigan has enjoyed great success as of late, finishing as a top-10 team in the NCAA's nine out of the last ten seasons, with its best finish coming in the 2012–13 season, in which they won the national championship. Michigan's total of 19 national championships in Swimming and Diving is the most of any team in history.\nCoaching history.\nThe University of Michigan Men's Swimming program began in 1921 and has had nine coaches in its history. The current coach is Mike Bottom, who became head coach after the departure of Bob Bowman in 2008. In five years at Michigan, Bottom has compiled dual-meet record of 40-3-1 (25-1 against Big Ten opponents) while winning four Big Ten Championships (2009, 2011–13) and an NCAA Championship (2013). He is a three-time Big Ten Swimming Coach of the Year (2011–13) and was the 2013 CSCAA Swimming Coach of the Year.\nThe coaching history is as follows:\nNotable alumni.\nThis is a list of notable swimmers and divers who have been affiliated with the University of Michigan.\nWomen's swimming and diving.\nHistory.\nThe University of Michigan Women's Swimming program has been a varsity sport since 1974. The current coach is Mike Bottom, who took over in August 2012, when the men's and women's teams were combined. He took over the post from head coach Jim Richardson who had been head coach of the Women's swim team for 27 years. Richardson announced his retirement on May 16, 2012. His teams won 12 consecutive Big Ten Conference titles from 1987 to 1998.\nCoaching history.\nThe coaching history is as follows:\nNotable alumnae.\nThis is a list of notable swimmers and divers who have been affiliated with the University of Michigan.\nU-M in the International Swimming Hall of Fame.\nMichigan's rich history in swimming and diving is evidenced by the 18 former student-athletes and coaches enshrined in the International Swimming Hall of Fame, located in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Individuals may be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as a swimmer, diver, water polo player, synchronized swimmer, coach or contributor. Criteria for selection into the Hall of Fame include achievements at the Olympic, World Championship and national levels, as well as world records held. Athletes must be retired from competition a minimum of four years, or at least one Olympic quadrennial. Individuals who are neither competitors nor coaches may be elected as a \"contributor\" whose achievements and innovations have had a profound effect on swimming and/or its administration.\nClub Wolverine.\nAbout.\nThe USA club swimming team that is affiliated with University team is Club Wolverine. The college swimmers train with the Club Wolverine Elite Team during the summer, but Club Wolverine is a very diverse organization that goes beyond its affiliation with the university. Club Wolverine is a parent run swim team for swimmers of all ages and abilities. It is routinely ranked the #1 club in Michigan and one of the top clubs in the U.S. CW's focus is on the long-term development of swimmers from learn-to-swim (Cubs Group) to local, state, national and international competition.\nProfessional swimming.\nClub Wolverine has always had an impressive squad of professional swimmers including many international superstars in the sport. Most notably, Michael Phelps trained on Club Wolverine for the four years leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nSummer camps.\nThe Club Wolverine team in congruence with the University of Michigan Varsity Swimming program runs a week-long stay-away camp in the summer. This camp is intended to be for young, but competitive swimmers that are looking to improve their skills in an environment that provides relatively high intensity. These young swimmers are coached personally on technique, endurance and speed by the Coaching staff of the University's varsity team and by professional and college athletes themselves. Most young swimmers that attend the camps stay in the University dorms. Campers are given opportunities to have fun by playing games, watching movies, and meeting inspiring athletes at the autograph signing and game night."

        "title": "Smash (tennis)",
        "text": "A smash in tennis is a shot that is hit above the hitter's head with a serve-like motion. It is also referred to as an overhead. A smash can usually be hit with a high amount of force and is often a shot that ends the point. Most smashes are hit fairly near the net or in mid-court before the ball bounces, generally against lobs that have not been hit high enough or deep enough by the opponent. A player can also smash a very high ball from the \"baseline\", generally on the bounce, although this is often a less forceful smash.\n\"Smash\" commonly refers to the forehand smash; backhand smashes are rarer and more difficult to execute, especially for beginners, since they are basically high backhand volleys generally hit at an exact angle causing the ball to spin. Rod Laver and Jimmy Connors, both left-handers, were known for their very powerful backhand smashes. The forehand smash was first used in Tennis by Helena Rice on championship point in the 1890 Wimbledon Championships final.\nIn his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a fine overhead himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \"OVERHEAD—Schroeder just tops here, ahead of Rosewall and Newcombe.\nGrip and action.\nThe grip used for a tennis smash is usually a continental grip although some players use an Eastern grip. The swing is an upward throwing motion, making the execution of the shot almost identical to a serve. The main difference from a serve is position and footwork. The positioning and footwork are more similar to a volley which is usually hit with a strong forward weight transfer from inside the court. The smash can be executed with one or both feet on the ground.\nJimmy Connors invented and popularized the \"skyhook\", a version of the overhead smash in which the Eastern grip used to hit the ball further behind the body than is possible with a traditional overhead smash.\nPete Sampras (and before him Yannick Noah) popularized the \"jump smash\", where the player jumps and then hits the smash in mid-air. The shot is often also called a slam dunk, as in basketball."

        "title": "Tennis shot",
        "text": "In tennis, there are a variety of types of shots (ways of hitting the ball) which can be categorized in various ways. The grip you place on will help you have different types of shots, the lower your grip means that the ball is most likely going to be a ground stroke. According to William T. Tilden, \"All tennis strokes, should be made with the body' at right angles to the net, with the shoulders lined up parallel to the line of flight of the ball.\" The serve is the opening shot of a point. Groundstrokes are hit after the ball has already bounced, and can be either forehands or backhands depending on which direction the racket is swung relative to the body. A lob is a groundstroke hit well over the head of an opponent who is positioned at the net. A passing shot is a groundstroke that is hit out of reach of an opponent at the net far to his left or right. A \"cross-court shot\" is a shot hit from the left (or right) side of one player's court to the left (or right) side of the other player's court (from each player's own point of view), so that it crosses the lengthwise centerline of the court. A \"down-the-line shot\" is one that is hit more or less parallel to, and near to, one of the sidelines, so that it never crosses the centerline.\nShots hit during a point without the ball having bounced are called volleys, while shots hit just a split second after the ball bounces are called half volleys. A smash is hit with the racket well above one's head with great velocity. A drop shot is a groundstroke or volley that is hit lightly so that it barely goes over the net.\nA \"slice\" is a groundstroke or volley hit with backspin, while a \"topspin shot\" is a groundstroke or occasionally a volley hit with topspin.\nThus tennis shots can be categorized according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they are hit (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).\nAll shots that pass either over or around the net and land anywhere within the confines of the court, lines included (except for serves, which need to land inside the designated service box), are considered \"good\". Shots that touch the net and then land in their designated area are also considered \"good\", with the exception of serves. Serves that fall into the service box after touching the net are called \"service lets\", and the server simply serves again, without any impact on the scoring. \nServe.\nA serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to begin the point. The most common serve is used is an \"overhead serve\". It is initiated by tossing the ball into the air over the server's head and hitting it when the arm is fully stretched out (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The server may employ different types of serve: a flat, a top-spin, an American twist (or kick), or a slice serve. A severely sliced serve is sometimes called a sidespin. Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an \"ace\".\nForehand.\nThe \"forehand\" is struck from the dominant side of the body by swinging the racquet in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. It is called a forehand because the racquet is held in such a way that if one were to strike the ball without the racquet, it would hit the palm of your hand. This is the opposite side from a \"backhand\". It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.\nThere are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the \"Continental\", the \"Eastern\", and the \"Western\". The key differences between grips are the different angles they create between the angle of your palm and the angle of your racquet face. You are used to sensing the direction your palm is facing, so your palm makes the most intuitive basis for sensing the direction your racquet is facing. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a \"western\" grip. Few top players used the \"western\" grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the \"western\" forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to devastating effect against larger, more powerful players, and many female and young players use the two-handed stroke today.\nBackhand.\nThe \"backhand\" is struck from the non-dominant side of the body by bringing the racquet across the body (showing the \"back\" of your hand to the opponent) and swinging the racquet away from one's body in the direction of where the player wants the ball to go. It is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. It can be executed with either one or both hands. For most of the 20th Century it was performed with one hand, using either an \"eastern\" or a \"continental\" grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. The two-handed backhand was used more often since it allowed easy access to power and control. Players such as Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Andre Agassi have used this stroke to its highest potential to win many grandslams. Two hands give the player more power so it provides the player with an advantage on power-focused shots. However, one hand is useful in that it can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a deadly accurate slice backhand with underspin through the 1950s and '60s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.\nVolley.\nA volley is made in the air \"before\" the ball bounces, generally near the net or inside of the service line. Volleys consist of the forehand volley and backhand volley and are usually made with a stiff-wristed \"punching\" motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, once again generally in the vicinity of the net. From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber (the player hitting the lob) to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, the opponent may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot (hit over the player's head), to end the point. Finally, if an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it.\nOther shots.\nThe \"tweener\" is a rarely used shot in which a player hits the ball between his/her legs, generally with their back facing the net. Also known as the between-the-legs shot or the \"Gran Willy\" (after Guillermo Vilas, an early pioneer), it is generally performed when the player must run to recover a lob and has no time to turn back to face the net before attempting their return. The shot was pioneered in the 1970s by Guillermo Vilas and Yannick Noah, both of whom claimed to have invented it; later players to use it include Ilie Năstase, Boris Becker, Gabriela Sabatini (whose version was called the \"Sabatwini\"), Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Nicholas Kyrgios who helped popularize the shot. Forward-facing between-the-legs shots are also occasionally employed; they are sometimes called \"front tweeners\".\nThe \"Bucharest Backfire\" is an over-the-shoulder backward shot, generally used to recover lobs. Tennis writer Bud Collins named it in honor of Romanian player Ilie Năstase, who popularized it. Another seldom used shot is a behind-the-back shot, which, as its name suggests, is hit by crossing the preferred arm across his/her back without swinging. It is generally hit while stationary, and can occasionally be used as a volley shot. It is challenging to master as it is hard to predict where the ball may strike the racket, if not at all in most cases. Accurately hitting the ball to the desired location is also extremely hard to do.\nThe \"Bowl Smash\", also known as the \"Skyhook Smash\", or the \"Skyhook\", is a variation of the \"Bucharest Backfire\", showcased by Jimmy Connors. It consists on hitting a \"Bucharest Backfire\" while jumping, in order to recover lobs earlier, given the additional vertical reach provided by the jump. The player performing that shot may end up doing a full 360° spin in the process. Roger Federer and more frequently Rafael Nadal are known for performing this shot, even during official matches for the latter."

        "title": "Sabre (fencing)",
        "text": "The sabre (US English: \"saber\", both pronounced ) is one of the three disciplines of modern fencing. The sabre weapon is for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge and the back of the blade (unlike the other modern fencing weapons, the épée and foil, where a touch is scored only using the point of the blade).\nThe informal term sabreur refers to a male fencer who follows the discipline; sabreuse is the female equivalent.\nWeapon.\n\"The blade, which must be of steel, is approximately rectangular in section. The maximum length of the blade is . The minimum width of the blade, which must be at the button, is ; its thickness, also immediately below the button, must be at least .\"\nThe cross-sectional profile of the sabre blade is commonly a V-shaped base which transitions to a flat rectangular shaped end with most blade variants, but this is dependent on how it is manufactured. This allows the blade to be flexible towards the end. According to regulation, manufacturers must acknowledge that the blade must be fixed horizontally at a point from the tip of the blade.\nStandardised adult (size 5) blades are in length (excluding other components). At the end of the blade, the point is folded over itself to form a \"button\" which, when viewed end on, must have a square or rectangular section of no larger or smaller. The button must not be any more than from the end of the blade section.\nThe guard is full in shape, made in one piece and is externally smooth; the curvature of the guard is continuous without any aesthetic perforations or rims. The interior of the guard is fully insulated by either paint or a pad. The guard is designed to provide the hand adequate protection to ensure that injury does not occur which may hinder the performance of the fencer. Guards are dimensionally measured in section where the blade is parallel with the axis of the gauge.\nOn electrical sabres, a socket for the body wire is found underneath the bell guard. A fastener known as a pommel is attached to the end of the sword to keep the bell guard and handle on. It electrically separates the handle and the guard.\nThe conventional handle of the sabre is shaped so that it may be held so that the hand may slide down to gain further extension of the weapon relative to the fencer. Other grips which form various shapes are incompatible and impractical with sabre as they limit the movement of the hand, and are likely to be ergonomically incompatible with the guard.\nThe entire weapon is generally long; the maximum weight is , but most competition swords are closer to . It is shorter than the foil or épée, and lighter than the épée, hence physically easier to move swiftly and decisively. However the integrity of the sabre blade is not as strong as other weapons as it is more likely to break due to the design.\nElectrical sabre.\nLike other weapons used in fencing, the modern sabre uses an electrical connection to register touches. The sabreur wears a lamé, a conductive jacket, to complete the circuit and register a touch to a valid target.\nSabre was the last weapon in fencing to make the transition over to using electrical equipment. This occurred in 1988, 32 years (1956) after the foil and 52 years (1936) after the épée. In 2004, immediately following the Athens Summer Olympics, the timing for recording a touch was shortened from its previous setting, dramatically altering the sport and method in which a touch is scored.\nUnlike the other two weapons, there is very little difference between an electric sabre and a steam or dry (non-electric) one. The blade itself is the same in steam and electric sabres, as there is no need for a blade wire or pressure-sensitive tip in an electric sabre. An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or bayonet foil socket with the two contacts shorted together. The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any blade contact to be registered as a valid touch.\nEarly electric sabres were equipped with a capteur socket. The capteur was a small mechanical accelerometer that was intended to distinguish between a good cut and a mere touch of the blade against the target. In November 2019, the FIE announced their intention to re-introduce the capteur to sabre using modern accelerometer technology.\nTarget area.\nThe general target area for the discipline, that is, all areas where a valid hit may be scored, comprises the entire torso above the waist, the head, and the arms up to the wrist. The legs, hands and feet are excluded from the target area.\nA single circuit for the entire target area used in scoring systems is formed by multiple conductive equipment:\nBecause touches can be scored using the edge of the blade, there is no need for a pressure-sensitive head (the \"button\") to be present on the end of the blade. When fencing \"electric\" (as opposed to \"steam\" or \"dry\") a current runs through the sabre blade. When the blade comes into contact with the lamé, the electrical mask, or the manchette, current flows through the body cord and interacts with the scoring equipment.\nScoring.\nCentral judging apparatus.\nThe scoring apparatus or box aids the referee's final judgement. As for all electrical apparatus used in modern fencing, the referee must take into account the possibility of mechanical failure. Most sabre hits are registered by light signals placed on top of the sabre apparatus (red and green distinguishable for each fencer, with the light indicating the fencer who registered a hit) and accompanied by audible signal(s) consisting of either a short ring or a continuous note limited to two seconds.\nIn some circumstances a white signal is indicated when a fencer has hit off-target.\nLockout period.\nThe lockout period is the minimum amount of time between registered touches respective of the target area. This period is set into the electrical apparatus to aid judgement.\nRecent regulation adjustments to the \"functioning times of the scoring apparatuses\" following from the 2016 Olympic Games modified the registering times from 120 ms to 170 ms Scoring apparatuses with the new modification are marked with a magenta identification label bearing in black text \"FIE 2016\".\nChanging the lockout timing effectively changed the way with which the sabre was fenced, making it faster with greater emphasis on footwork. Although the essential nature of the game would remain the same, the strategies for attack and defense would need to be rethought.\nThe timing change was initially greeted with a degree of controversy, as many fencers were accustomed to having the longer timings. This made the techniques then employed vulnerable to fast stop-cuts (a hit made by the defender that lands whilst the attacker is still beginning an attack, also known as a skyhook) or (a second attack made by the original attacker after the first has technically finished). It was commonly regarded that the shorter timings would only encourage poor technique and an \"attack only\" mentality, negating much of the art of the sport.\nRemises and stop-cuts would not normally score a point, as a hit by the attacker would take priority. However, the hit made with priority may arrive too late under the shorter timings to register, and so the stop-cuts and remises would indeed score.\nAs a result of the narrower timings, the efficacy of attacks into preparation was increased, meaning that it was now more critical that the preparing fencer must already have begun an attack by the time the two fencers were in hitting distance of each other.\nThe techniques of how to parry and riposte have been extended. The solid parries, used extensively before the change of timings, would be supplemented by an additional step back by the defender to avoid the attacker remising (continuing to push their blade after their attack has technically done) or else the defence to be performed as a beat-attack, an extending arm that deflects the oncoming attack halfway through the extension before hitting the original attacker's target area.\nWith hindsight, the shorter timings seem to have encouraged a tightening and refinement of the original techniques with smaller, neater moves so that, on the whole, sabre fencing became faster and more precise than it had ever been before.\nRight of way.\nWhen both signals indicate, it rests upon the referee to decide which fencer scores the point. The decision is based on the concept of right of way which gives the point to the fencer who had priority, i.e. the attacking fencer. As with foil, the other right of way weapon, priority is gained in many ways, which can be broken down into active, passive, and defensive categories:\nIf neither fencer has 'right of way' in a double touch situation (typically, if both initiate the attack simultaneously in so far as the director can determine), the action is called a \"simultaneous attack\" and no point is awarded unless an attack is initiated first and is not parried or missed.\nRight of way rules were initially established to encourage fencers to use parries and other techniques in order to hit without being hit, as they would logically desire to do if they were using sharp swords. Subsequently, the rules of right of way have been altered simply to keep the strategy and technique of sabre interesting and (relatively) easy to understand.\nReferee.\nThe referee may halt the action for reasons such as a safety hazard, fencer injury, or violation of the rules. When the referee says \"halt\", no further action may score a point. For cases of rules violations, the referee may choose to either warn the offender or show him or her a penalty card. A warning has no scoring implication. Cards, on the other hand, have further penalties:\nThe referee will traditionally score the bout in French, but most non-French speaking referees tend to make calls in the relevant local language. However, in international competitions, the referees are required to use French. There are also associated hand motions the referees will make to indicate specific calls in order to bridge a potential language barrier. Most current referees are required to make calls both verbally and with the relevant hand motions to avoid any type of confusion.\nTechnique.\nAt sabre, it is generally easier to attack than to defend (for example, the timing favours remises) and high-level international sabre fencing is often very fast and very simple, although when required, top sabreurs do display an extended repertoire of tactical devices. In response to the relatively high speed of sabre fencing (sabre is the fastest sport in the world combat wise), the rules for sabre were changed to prohibit the forward cross-over (where the back foot passes the front foot) – it is now a cardable offence. Thus, the flèche attack is no longer permissible, so sabre fencers have instead begun to use a \"flunge\" (flying lunge). This attack begins like a flèche, but the fencer pushes off from the ground and moves quickly forward, attempting to land a hit before their feet cross over. Similarly, \"running attacks\" – consisting of a failed flèche followed by continuous remises – have also been eliminated.\nSabre defense comprises the three primary parries:\nand three secondary parries:\nAnother parry, lesser-known, but which works against opponents of the same handedness, is referred to as \"the Hungarian\". This parry is most useful when both fencers charge off the line towards each other. To perform the Hungarian, a fencer throws a \"prime\" parry when the opponent is within striking distance and sweeps upward into a \"quinte\" position, covering (in the process) nearly all target area, and performs the riposte as with a normal \"quinte\" parry. The Hungarian technique often works best if a step or angle is taken in the opposite direction of the \"prime\" parry. This technique will not work with two fencers of opposite handedness.\nIt follows from the nature of sabre parries (they block an incoming attack rather than deflecting it as in foil and épée) that they are static and must be taken as late as possible to avoid being duped by a feint attack, committing to a parry in the wrong line and being unable to change parry (which often involves completely altering the orientation of the blade while moving and rotating the wrist and forearm) to defend against the real attack quickly enough.\nCircles, such as Circle 3, 4, and 5, defend against stabs to the body, which an ordinary parry would not block. This is extremely useful, as it is highly versatile, covering much of the target area.\nThere are variations of the primary and secondary parries where the fencer uses their body along with the blade. The most popular is when the fencer jumps into the air and throws a \"Seconde.\" If done correctly, the defender can block an attack to the \"Tierce\" sector while taking advantage of the high ground. Another example is when the fencer squats to the floor and takes a \"Quinte\" to both make themselves a smaller target and block their only weak point.\nEach fencing weapon has a different tempo, and the tempo for épée and foil is rather slow with sudden bursts of speed. Sabre is fast throughout the entire touch. However, many coaches are urging pupils to slow down the pace by taking smaller steps instead of larger ones."

        "text": "Jose Ramos (born 1965), aka Pepe Ramos, is a Puerto Rican boxing manager and salesman.\nBiography.\nJose Ramos surfaced in the 1990s, after working as a salesman for Puerto Rican cookie brand Rovira Biscuits Corporation in the southern Puerto Rican city of Ponce, when he became famous in the boxing world as Félix Trinidad's career took off. Ramos, Trinidad and Félix Trinidad Sr. were united by a contract, and, in Ramos and Trinidad Jr.'s case, by friendship. Ramos and Trinidad Jr. met in 1991.\nRamos became vital to Trinidad's first era as a boxer, becoming an important link between the Trinidads and promoter Don King. Ramos helped work deals for Félix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya, Pernell Whitaker, Yori Boy Campas, Héctor Camacho and David Reid, among others. Ramos was in New York, New York, when the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred; Trinidad was scheduled to fight Bernard Hopkins at the Madison Square Garden on September 15 of that year. The fight took place on September 29 instead, and Trinidad lost by a twelfth-round knockout.\nTrinidad retired after one more fight, a win over Hacine Cherifi. Félix Trinidad Sr. also retired as a manager following his son's retirement. As a consequence, he decided to distribute his other boxers between his close associates, including Ramos. Among the boxers that Ramos received was Fres Oquendo, a Heavyweight contender at the time. Ramos received Oquendo after Oquendo had lost by a ninth-round knockout to David Tua. He received one dollar and an economical remuneration for a lawsuit that he established against Félix Trinidad Sr. in Chicago, Illinois. The lawsuit is still to be decided.\nRamos helped Oquendo get title shots against Chris Byrd, who beat Oquendo by a twelve-round decision for the IBF world Heavyweight title, and against John Ruiz, who knocked Oquendo out in the eleventh round for the WBA world Heavyweight title, the latter fight being also being held at the Madison Square Garden and becoming the first time two Latin Americans and two Puerto Ricans fought for a world Heavyweight championship.\nOquendo later wanted to terminate his contract with Ramos, which caused for a verbal fight to break out between the two in different Puerto Rican media, including newspapers.\nRamos is still the on contract manager of Oquendo, and he returned with Félix Trinidad Jr. for his fights against Ricardo Mayorga and Ronald Wright.\nTrinidad Jr.'s financial problems.\nRamos purchased about $63,000,000 dollars in bonds for the Trinidads during Felix Jr.'s career. These were bought as an investment, but when Puerto Rico hit a financial crisis during the mid-2010s, their value dropped as Puerto Rican bonds ratings were reduced to junk status, causing the Trinidads to lose the money invested by Ramos."

        "title": "Tennis strategy",
        "text": "Players use different strategies while playing tennis to enhance their own strengths and exploit their opponent's weaknesses in order to gain the advantage and win more points.\nPlayers typically specialize or naturally play in a certain way, based on what they can do best. Based on their style, players generally fit into one of three types, \"baseliners\", \"volleyers\", \"all-court players\". Many players have attributes of all three categories but, at times, may also focus on just one style based on the surface, or on the condition, or on the opponent.\nA \"baseliner\" plays from the back of the tennis court, around/behind/within the baseline, preferring to hit groundstrokes, thereby allowing themselves more time to react to their opponent's shots, rather than to come up to the net (except in certain situations). Many modern professional players employ this style most of the time.\nA \"volleyer\" plays nearer towards the net, preferring to hit volleys, whereby providing their opponent less time to react to their shots, rather than to stay/play from further back on the tennis court (except in certain situations). Many classic traditional players employed this style the best in the past.\n\"All-court players\" fall somewhere in between, employing both \"baseliner\" strategies and \"volleyer\" strategies depending on the situations.\nA player's weaknesses may also determine strategy. For example, most players typically have a stronger forehand shot and therefore they will favor the forehand, hence will re-balance their posture and re-adjust their position by \"running around\" a more logical backhand cross-court to enable them to hit an inside-out forehand instead. Or likewise, some players with a more dominant backhand shot and hence they will instead favor the backhand, thus will switch their stance, change their hand grip and with \"quick footwork\" hit a backhand down-the-line instead of a more convenient inside-in forehand.\nBaseliner.\nOffensive baseliner.\nAn offensive or aggressive baseliner tries to control and dictate play by hitting powerful groundstrokes for winners usually from the area of the baseline or behind it. An effective offensive baseliner can overpower many opponents; however, when going for winners, they can also produce many \"errors\" since they have to repeatedly and correctly execute some difficult strokes, such as down-the-line winners landing near the corner. Fatigue, loss of focus, mis-hitting the ball, and hesitating are some reasons for errors. Two great old-time players, R. Norris Williams and Ellsworth Vines, were famous for being unbeatable when their strokes were \"on\". However, they played with such little margin for error in making their strokes that when they were making more mistakes they could be beaten by other players. Another advantage of this strategy is that the player can weaken his opponent's confidence by successfully landing difficult shots which in turn may increase his own confidence.\nHard courts are generally considered to be the best surface for an offensive baseliner who often hit higher risk shots. However, offensive baseliners can often excel on both grass and clay courts as well. On grass, they can execute their \"winners\" and the fast, low bounce makes it harder for opponents to retrieve; whereas on clay courts, some offensive baseliners might like the slow and high bounce because it gives them a longer time to change their grip and foot-positions in order to set up for an offensive shot or winner. Offensive baseliners with height especially have an advantage on clay courts because the high bounces land in their hitting zones, allowing them to strike the ball cleanly and more powerfully such as Ana Ivanović. At 6'0\" (184 cm), she took advantage of the high bounces on the clay courts that led to back-to-back French Open finals in 2007, and a crown in 2008. Maria Sharapova, who is 6'2\"(188 cm), had the hardest hit backhand at the women's 2013 French Open, when she punished a first serve from Jelena Janković, producing a backhand return winner.\nSuccessful pioneers of this style include Steffi Graf and Monica Seles on the women's side and Andre Agassi and Jim Courier on the men's. Serena Williams is also known for excelling with this style. Maria Sharapova is another aggressive baseliner who excelled by generating powerful strikes on both wings, and was regarded as one of the best during her era. Novak Djokovic is also a notable offensive baseliner, with his powerful and precise backhand which is widely regarded as the best backhand in the men's game. Serena Williams is considered the greatest offensive baseliner in women's tennis history due to her powerful serve and powerful forceful groundstrokes.\nDefensive baseliner.\nA defensive baseliner, \"counter-puncher\" or \"retriever\", tries to return every ball and relies on the opponent making mistakes. The trademarks of a counterpuncher include consistent shots with low error rate, as well as precise placement that makes it hard for their opponent to execute an aggressive shot. Counterpunchers also have a tendency to anticipate and are usually equipped with extremely good passing shots, thus enabling them to turn many defensive situations into offence. The game of the defensive counter-puncher has more to do with physical endurance and willingness to get every ball back in play as well as mental determination to keep from getting bored or trying for too much. Their game plan often involves moving their opponents back to the court and outmaneuvering their opponents. One example is former world number one Caroline Wozniacki who moves her opponent around the court without going for high risk winners. While on defence, she gets every ball back and constantly mixes up the pace, to frustrate her opponents.\nWhile they tend to make relatively few errors because they do not attempt the complicated and ambitious shots of the aggressive baseliner, the effective counterpuncher must be able to periodically execute an aggressive shot, either using the pace given by their opponent or using precision and angle. Speed and agility are key for the counterpuncher, as well as a willingness to patiently chase down every ball to frustrate opponents. Returning every aggressive shot that the opponent provides is often the cause of further errors due to the effort required in trying increasingly harder and better shots. However, it is noted that for some faster players, including Gaël Monfils, Gilles Simon, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Murray, standing too deep behind the court can hinder their attacking abilities.\nAt lower levels, the defensive counter-puncher often frustrates their opponent so much that they may try to change their style of play due to ineffective baseline results. At higher levels, the all-court player or aggressive baseliner is usually able to execute winners with higher velocity and better placement, taking the counterpuncher out of the point as early as possible.\nMost counter-punchers often excel on slow courts, such as clay. The court gives them extra time to chase down shots and it is harder for opponents to create winners. However, some counter-punchers who have the ability to mix up their game and turn defense into offense, like Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray and Agnieszka Radwańska have excelled on faster courts like hard and grass as well as slower courts. Counter-punchers are often particularly strong players at low-level play, where opponents cannot make winners with regularity.\nVolleyer.\nAn aggressive volleyer has a great net game, is quick around the net, and has fine touch for volleys. \"Serve and volleyers\" come up to the net at every opportunity when serving, both as a tactical play or a strategic play. They are almost always attackers and can hit many \"winners\" with varieties of volleys, drop volleys, half volleys, smashes, touch shots, block shots, lobs, squash shots, etc. When not serving, they often employ the \"chip-and-charge\", chipping back the serve without attempting to hit a winner and rushing the net. The serve-and-volleyers' strategies and tactics are to put pressure on the opponent to try to hit difficult passing shots. This strategy is extremely effective against pushers.\nServe-and-volleyers benefit from playing on fast courts, such as grass or fast concrete. The quick bounce and faster pace of play give them an advantage because opponents have less time to set up for a passing shot. However, the number of serve-and-volley players is decreasing in today's professional tennis, because this strategy requires more experience to master and defeat other playing styles (as well as changes in racquet technology that have improved players' passing shots). In addition to this, there has been a trend toward the slowing down of tennis surfaces over the past few years. The serve-and-volley technique works better on faster surfaces because the volleyer is able to put more balls away without the baseliner being able to chase them down. Although serve and volleyers may be a dying breed, there are still some great players who employ this tactic. The Frenchman Michaël Llodra has been considered by many to be the best pure serve and volleyer of today's game. Other notable volleyers of the past and present, includes Jack Kramer, Pancho Gonzales, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Patrick Cash, Patrick Rafter, Richard Krajicek, Tim Henman, Goran Ivanišević, Mark Philippoussis, Greg Rusedski, Mario Ančić, Ivan Ljubičić, Taylor Dent, Mardy Fish, Nicolas Mahut, Rajeev Ram, Ivo Karlović, Milos Raonic, John Isner, Dustin Brown, Pierre-Hugues Herbert, Maxime Cressy, Łukasz Kubot, Mischa Zverev. \nBill Tilden, the dominant player of the 1920s, preferred to play from the back of the court, and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who rushed the net – one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him. In his book \"Match Play and the Spin of the Ball\", Tilden propounds the theory that \"by definition\" a great baseline player will always beat a great serve-and-volleyer. Some of the greatest matches of all time have pitted great baseliners such as Björn Borg, Mats Wilander, Andre Agassi against great volleyers such as John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras.\nSome players, such as Feliciano López, Tommy Haas, Roger Federer and Andy Roddick will only employ this strategy on grass courts or as a surprise tactic on any surface. Roger Federer uses this commonly against Rafael Nadal, to break up long rallies and physically taxing games.\nAll-court player.\nAll-court players, all-rounders, all-courters, have aspects of every tennis style, whether that be offensive baseliner, defensive counter-puncher or aggressive serve-and-volleyer. All-court players use the best bits from each style and mix it together to create a truly formidable tennis style to play against. In game situations they are very versatile; when an all-court player's baseline game is not working, he/she may switch to a net game, and vice versa. All-court players have the ability to adjust to different opponents that play different styles more easily than pure baseliners and true volleyers with an adaptive change in strategies and tactics even during the gameplay. All-court players typically have the speed, determination and fitness of a defensive counter-puncher, the confidence, skill and flair of an offensive baseliner, as well as the touch, the agility around the net and the tactical thinking of an aggressive volleyer.\nHowever, just because the all-court player has a combination of skills used by all tennis styles does not necessarily mean that they can beat an offensive baseliner or a defensive counter-puncher or even an aggressive volleyer. It just means it would be more difficult to read the game of an all-court player.\nExamples of professional tennis players who could be considered as all-rounders are David Nalbandian, Tommy Haas, Feliciano López, Marcelo Ríos, Cédric Pioline, Carlos Moyá, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Michael Stich, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Rod Laver, Don Budge, Lew Hoad, Bill Tilden, Carlos Alcaraz, Ken Rosewall, Ellsworth Vines in men's singles and Daniela Hantuchová, Agnieszka Radwańska, Amélie Mauresmo, Justine Henin, Venus Williams, Martina Hingis, Kim Clijsters, Francesca Schiavone, Helen Wills, Suzanne Lenglen, and Gabriela Sabatini in women's singles.\nServing strategy.\nHolding serve is crucial in tennis. To hold serve, serves must be accurately placed, and a high priority should be placed on first serve percentage. In addition, the velocity of serve is important. A weak serve can be easily attacked by an aggressive returner. The first ball after the serve is also key. Players should serve in order to get a weak return and keep the opponent on the defense with that first shot. For example, following a wide serve, it is ideal to hit the opponent's return to the open court.\nThere are three different types of serves and each one of them can be used in different situations. One type of serve is the serve with slice. The slice serve works better when the player tosses the ball to the right and immediately hits the outer-right part of the ball. This serve is best used when you hit it wide so you get your opponent off the court.\nAnother type is the kick serve. To achieve a good execution, the player must toss the ball above the head and immediately spin the bottom-left part of the ball. Since the ball is tossed above the head, it is necessary for the player to arch correctly under the ball. This serve is best used as second serve because the amount of spin that is added to the ball makes it very safe. The kick serve is also effective when a change of rhythm is needed or when the opponent struggles with the high bounce that results from the effect.\nA third type of serve is the flat one. To execute this serve, the player must toss the ball right in front and immediately hit the middle-top part of the ball. This is usually a very hard serve and therefore risky. However, if the flat serve is executed with enough power and precision, it can turn into a great weapon to win points faster.\nDoubles strategy.\nThough strategy is important in singles, it is even more important in doubles. The additional width of the alleys on the doubles court has a great effect on the angles possible in doubles play. Consequently, doubles is known as a game of angles.\nThere are three basic doubles strategies:\nBoth-up strategy.\nThe ideal is both-up strategy, often called \"Attacking Doubles\" because the net is the \"high ground\", and the both-up strategy puts both players close to it, in a position to score because of their excellent vantage points and angles. A team in the both-up formation, however, is vulnerable to a good lob from either opponent at any time. To be successful with Attacking Doubles, teams must have effective serves and penetrating volleys to prevent good lobs and good overhead shots to put away poor returns.\nTeams that play attacking doubles try to get into the both-up formation on every point. When serving, their server follows most first serves to the net and some second serves. As a result, attacking doubles is also called \"serve-and-volley doubles\". When receiving, their receiver follows most second-service returns to the net.\nAt the professional level, attacking doubles is the standard, though slowly degrading, strategy of choice.\nUp-and-back strategy.\nAt lower levels of the game, not all players have penetrating volleys and strong overhead shots. So, many use up-and-back strategy. The weakness in this formation is the large angular gap it creates between partners, a gap that an opposing net player can easily hit a clean winner through if they successfully poach a passing shot.\nNonetheless, up-and-back strategy is versatile, with elements of both offense and defense. In fact, since the server must begin each point at the baseline and the receiver must be far enough back to return the serve, virtually every point in doubles begins with both teams in this formation.\nTeams without net games strong enough to play Attacking Doubles can still play both-up when they have their opponents on the defensive. To achieve this, a team would patiently play up-and-back for a chance to hit a forcing shot and bring their baseliner to the net.\nAustralian Doubles and the I-Formation are variations of up-and-back strategy. In Australian doubles, the server's partner at net lines up on the same side of the court, fronting the opposing net player, who serves as a poaching block and blind. The receiver then must return serve down the line and is liable to have that return poached. In the I-Formation, the server's net partner lines up in the center, between the server and receiver to be able to poach in either direction. Both Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are poaching formations that can also be used to start the point for serve-and-volley doubles.\nBoth-back strategy.\nBoth-back strategy is strictly defensive. It is normally seen only when the opposing team is both-up or when the returner is passing the net player on the return. This might be a good tactic when the opponent has a serve with a lot of pressure and an aggressive player at the net. From here the defenders can return the most forcing shots till they get a chance to hit a good lob or an offensive shot. If their opponents at net become impatient and try to angle the ball away when a baseliner can reach it, the defender can turn the tables and score outright. However this strategy leaves the volley court open to drop shots from the opposition."

        "title": "2005 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2005 Ashes series was that year's edition of the long-standing cricket rivalry between England and Australia. Starting on 21 July 2005, England and Australia played five Tests, with the Ashes held by Australia as the most recent victors. The final result was a 2–1 series win for England, who succeeded (for the first time since 1986–87) in their biennial attempt to win the urn.\nIn March, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said this Ashes series would be the closest since Australia's dominance began in 1989. Since 1989, when Australia started their winning Ashes streak, England had lost by more than one match in all but one of the series played, that of 1997. During that period, Australia were the pre-eminent side in the world, while England had dropped from being the top-rated in 1981 to sixth for much of the 1990s, reaching a low point in 1999 with a series loss to New Zealand leaving them bottom of the unofficial \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" rankings. However, since the previous series in 2002–03, England had improved on their fifth place in the official rankings, and were second before this series. Australia were still top-ranked, but England had won 14 and drawn three of their 18 previous Test matches since March 2004, and had won six successive series. Nonetheless, before the First Test some Australians, including fast bowler Glenn McGrath, were suggesting that a 5–0 win in the series for Australia was a serious possibility.\nOn the day after the series it was \"hailed as the most thrilling series ever\". Three matches in particular were very closely fought, with one match decided by a two-run margin, one match drawn with only one wicket remaining, and one match won by three wickets. The outcome of the contest was not decided until the last day of the series.\nAustralia won the first Test comfortably, but in the second Test at Edgbaston, considered to be one of the greatest of all time, England levelled the series with a two-run victory, the narrowest win in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England won the fourth Test in Nottingham (Trent Bridge) by three wickets, losing seven men in a chase of 129, after England enforced the follow-on after gaining a lead of 259 on first innings.\nThe fifth and final Test started on 8 September, at the Oval in London. It entered its final day with England batting in their second innings, 40 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand. Australia needed a win to force a 2–2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give the Ashes to England and end 16 years and eight series of Australian dominance. After a day of fluctuating fortunes, England established a lead of 341 after Kevin Pietersen's maiden century of 158 runs, and Australia batted for one over before the teams went off for bad light, and the match was declared a draw, ensuring the return of the Ashes to England.\nSquads.\na) Collingwood was added on 1 August for the second Test, but sent back to his county on 3 August.\nb) An injury to Simon Jones saw Anderson come into the squad for the fifth Test, while Tremlett was dropped because he was \"not on top of his game\" according to England's chairman of selectors David Graveney. Collingwood was also called up again.\nc) Clark was called up as cover for pace bowlers McGrath and Lee before the third Test.\nMatch details.\nFirst Test.\nThe first day of cricket at Lord's saw 17 of the total of 40 wickets fall, and though Australia lost 10 of them, the BBC saw it as \"advantage Australia\". Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and Steve Harmison shook up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers; the second ball of the match hit Justin Langer on the elbow but he went on to make 40 and top score for Australia. The pitch offered bounce and swing from the start, while Matthew Hoggard got a ball on line to swing between Matthew Hayden's bat and pad and into his off stump. Hayden was gone for 12, having, according to the BBC report, \"played nervously from the word go\". Australia still scored at a rate above 4.5 runs per over in the mini-session before drinks, which was taken when Harmison cut Ponting on the right cheek, and in his next over Harmison got his first wicket of the series as Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer was next to depart, having scored at above five an over when he top-edged a pull shot to Harmison at square-leg for 40 off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff, whose first over in Ashes cricket was a wicket maiden. In the next over, Simon Jones was brought on, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn caught behind for 2, and in the penultimate over before lunch Michael Clarke was lbw to Jones, leaving Australia five down after the first session of play.\nAdam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all played a part in getting Australia past 100, forging innings in the 20s, but Flintoff had Gilchrist for 26 before Warne and Katich added 49 for the seventh wicket. Harmison, coming back for a second spell, was wicketless in his first two overs but after drinks he took four wickets for seven runs in 2.2 overs as Australia were all out for 190. He finished with five for 43. Glenn McGrath was the not out batsman, ending with 10 runs, and he also opened the bowling with Brett Lee. England batted for six overs until tea without losing a wicket, scoring 10 runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length, reaped the rewards after tea. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip to become McGrath's 500th victim in Test cricket, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell survived six overs, adding seven runs before McGrath had them bowled in the 13th and 15th over respectively. With Flintoff bowled by McGrath in the 17th, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their top six batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones batted together to make England's highest partnership of the innings, adding 58 and, according to the BBC report, \"treating Jason Gillespie with some disdain\". A short ball from Lee was too much for Geraint Jones, though, and he fended it to wicket-keeper Gilchrist, out for 30. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries to bat out the over, but the last ball of Lee's next over was glanced to the keeper, and Giles was out for 11, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.\nEngland cut the deficit on the second morning, but were still bowled out before they could build a first-innings lead. Hoggard departed for a 16-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Warne to Hayden in the slips. Pietersen now started to attack, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before he was out caught by Martyn, a diving catch just inside the boundary, and England were nine down for 122, still trailing by 68. The English 10th wicket pairing of Simon Jones and Harmison added 33 after that, a stand that was the fifth-highest of the game thus far and which reduced Australia's lead to 35 runs. In the field, England started by having Langer run out for 6 in the fifth over, but Hayden and Ponting rebuilt to bat until lunch unbeaten.\nThough Hayden was bowled by Flintoff for 34 three overs after lunch, the batsmen from three to six all passed 40; it was to be the only time in the series that Australia accomplished this feat. Clarke needed an extra life to do it, but made England pay after Pietersen dropped him on 21, and thus the partnership was allowed to last for 34.3 overs, with 155 runs being scored. Flintoff was smashed to all corners, with 84 runs being scored off him in his 19 second-day overs, but in the last 10 overs England came back to take wickets. Started by an inside-edge from Clarke off Hoggard, which left Australia's 24-year-old batsman bowled for 91, and Australia lost a further three wickets for 24 runs before the end of the day. The Australian lead was still 314, twice England's first innings total and then some, and Katich was still batting, not out on 10.\nFour overs into the morning, specialist spin bowler Giles was involved in a dismissal for the only time in the match, having Lee run out for 8. However, Gillespie batted for an hour and 15 minutes, and took part in a 52-run stand with the recognised batsman, Katich before Simon Jones got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump, after having three catches dropped. The last-wicket partnership rubbed it in with 43 more runs before Katich was caught by Simon Jones off Harmison, but England were set what would be a world record 420 to win.\nThey started positively, riding some favourable umpiring decisions; Aleem Dar turned down four strong leg before wicket (LBW) appeals off Warne. Strauss and Trescothick could thus add 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a short ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got off the mark with a four with his second ball, before facing 24 dot balls in the next three-quarters of an hour. Meanwhile, wickets fell at the other end, as Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip after having taken him for 10 in the previous over, and Bell was out LBW to a ball that did not turn. Three overs later, Vaughan was bowled cleanly by Lee and Flintoff gave a catch to Gilchrist, England were five down for 119, and though Pietersen once again put on more than 40 runs with Geraint Jones, England still needed 301 for the last five wickets, which would mean five partnerships higher than England had managed all match.\nRain frustrated both Australia and neutral fans who wanted to see cricket played on the morning of the fourth day, but at 1545 BST the rain relented and the covers were taken off. Then, it took 10 overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last; Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones were all dismissed for ducks, and England could only cut 24 runs off Australia's eventual win margin of 239. Twenty-two of those fourth-day runs came from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after his first match.\nSecond Test.\nThe psychological battles before the match included many Australian statements to the press about how the pitch \"played into [their] hands\", that England had been \"spending too much time talking\", and that their top order had been \"taking bad options\". England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it would choose to bowl first and would win, as had happened in 12 of the 13 Tests at Edgbaston since 1991. England came out on top in the mind game after Ricky Ponting won the toss and put England in to bat; Jonathan Agnew of the BBC claimed \"it was clear that his decision had backfired\" once England started batting.\nEngland took advantage of being inserted and came back strongly, becoming the first team to hit 400 runs in a first day of Test cricket against Australia since 1938. The English scored at a pace above four an over in their opening partnership, helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match; during a warm-up (playing rugby), the paceman accidentally stood on a stray cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and missed McGrath's superior control and wicket-taking abilities in the match.\nThe English innings began with Marcus Trescothick hitting nine boundaries off Brett Lee, while Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie and Kasprowicz. Their 112-run partnership was the highest by England in the series thus far; the Australians had only surpassed that once, through Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke's 155 at Lord's. To add to Australia's woes, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, and eventually went on to make 90, being the second man out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2 after 32.3 overs.\nIn the next five overs, England lost both Ian Bell, who notched up his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee, but that did little to slow the scoring rate. 132 runs had been taken in the morning session; the afternoon yielded 157. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit ten fours and one six, and made a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff's 68 was scored off 62 balls, and Lee's 18 balls were taken for 26 runs, including two sixes.\nLee bowled 17 overs, and conceded 111 runs, but got the one wicket of Pietersen, who pulled to Simon Katich for 71 off 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7 with 24 scheduled overs remaining in the day. Then, Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in a 15-minute 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, to end with four for 116, but by that time England had gone past 400 and ended up with a total of 407 in just under 80 overs. Just as Australia's opening batsman walked out and prepared for their innings, the rain began to fall on Edgbaston, and play had to be stopped.\nEngland's total could have been significantly higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden drove Harmison's new-ball partner Hoggard to short mid-off for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ponting and Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Martyn was run out taking a single for 20, again by Vaughan. Langer and Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs in an hour and a half, but a couple of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity. The partnership between Langer and Adam Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.\nThe pair looked to close England's lead and batted unbeaten after tea for eight overs, but again the England bowlers intervened, this time in the shape of Simon Jones, who got plenty of reverse swing both ways and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's last four, which now included Kasprowicz, who had a batting average 10 runs higher than McGrath, were nevertheless all dismissed for single-figure scores, Flintoff taking the last two men LBW with the last two balls, although there was some argument about whether the first dismissal, that of Gillespie, should have been given. Meanwhile, Giles' return of 3/78, including Ponting, Clarke and Warne, was to be his best bowling figures all series.\nHowever, England got their 99-run lead and continued to build their lead before stumps were drawn. After Trescothick and Strauss had hit five boundaries in six overs and taken the second innings total to 25 for 0, Ponting brought on Warne in the seventh over, and Warne broke through with his second ball of the innings; his leg break came into the left-hander's stumps and broke them completely, and Strauss was bowled for 6. Nightwatchman Hoggard survived four balls to end the day, when England held a lead of 124 runs, with nine wickets in hand.\nThe third day saw a total of 17 wickets fall, with Warne and Flintoff being the leading performers for their sides. First up, Lee grabbed three wickets in 12 minutes: Trescothick slashed a wide delivery and got an edge to the keeper, captain Vaughan got his third single-figure score in the series as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and Hoggard edged to Hayden in the slips for 1.\nEngland had lost four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Bell and Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen survived what looked like an edge on the first ball he faced, and went on to make 20 before he was given out in a similar situation from Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted past the hour mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist.\nEngland's last recognised batting pairing, between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones, saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had suffered an injury to his left shoulder and looked in obvious pain, and Jones departed shortly after lunch. Giles lasted longer, batting through 45 minutes before he was caught by Hayden, and Harmison faced one delivery to leave England at 131 for 9.\nSimon Jones and Flintoff carried on, however. Jones managed 12 runs in his 42-minute stay at the crease while Flintoff took Lee for 33 off the 28 balls he faced from the Australian paceman. Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz, with his third over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no-balls. At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, with only the bowler and wicket-keeper inside the circle. However, Flintoff hit a six over them, too, and another of his sixes landed on top of the stands. Flintoff ended with 73, as the only man to pass 25 for England, before he was bowled by Warne. Warne finished with figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end.\nHayden and Langer started positively, taking runs off the occasional bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and by the 12th over, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were well on the way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He failed to make the hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no-ball, so there was a seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.\nHayden kept going, and his dismissal came in an over where Australia had taken eight runs from the first four balls; however, Simon Jones got the last laugh over Hayden, only to later be reprimanded and fined by the International Cricket Council for his celebrations. England kept on the pressure, getting three more wickets before the scheduled close of play; Giles getting two, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and an in-swinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.\nAn extra half-hour of play was allowed, as a result was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne \"took the attacking approach\", and took on Giles for 12 in one over. He ended on 20 not out overnight, as Warne and Clarke batted together for 40 minutes before Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slower ball that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. Mark Nicholas, in live commentary, described the delivery as \"...one of the great balls. Given the moment, given the batsman and given the match, that is a staggering gamble that has paid off for Harmison. He bowled it perfectly.\" England now needed two wickets on the fourth day, while Australia needed 107 runs for the victory.\nEngland were said to be \"on the brink of...victory\", but Australia came back thanks to two partnerships worth more than 40 to take themselves within three runs of a 2–0 series lead. First, Warne and Lee added 45 for the ninth wicket, before Warne trod on his own stumps after a full Flintoff ball and was out hit wicket. Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison, and Simon Jones dropped Kasprowicz with 15 left to get. With Australia edging towards victory, preferring singles to risky boundaries, England were now bowling aggressive short balls at the tail-enders, hoping for short catches or to surprise the batsmen with a yorker. With four runs needed to win, Lee drove Harmison's attempted yorker towards the boundary where it was fielded. The Australians crossed for a single, leaving three runs to win with the weaker batsman Kasprowicz on strike. Harmison delivered another short ball, which Kasprowicz fended and Geraint Jones took an athletic catch down the leg side. England appealed, and Kasprowicz was given out caught by Bowden. However subsequent replays suggested that the ball contacted Kasprowicz's glove while not in contact with the bat handle, rendering Bowden's decision technically incorrect. England were nonetheless declared victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series was thus level with three matches left.\nAfter a short engagement with his team in victory celebrations, the subsequent reaction of Flintoff to the winning dismissal was to console the despondent batsman, Lee – a gesture which was widely commented upon as indicative of the good sportsmanship and mutual respect between the teams which characterised the series.\nEngland's two-run victory was the narrowest win (by runs) in Ashes cricket history to date (there had been two Ashes Tests won by a margin of only three runs). It was also the second narrowest margin of victory in Test cricket history behind only the West Indies' victory by a single run over Australia in Adelaide in 1993, which was later matched by New Zealand's 1-run win over England in Wellington in 2023.\nThird Test.\nDay 1\nWith the series square after England's close win in the second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham, neither side could secure the series win after the third Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, so there was still all to play for. The match began with England winning the toss, and choosing to bat first, thus giving Shane Warne a chance to become the first man to take 600 Test wickets in England's first innings, and he did so by getting Marcus Trescothick out caught behind by Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist when he mistimed a sweep shot, earning Warne a standing ovation from the Old Trafford faithful.\nAfter naming an unchanged line-up, England were immediately faced by the pairing of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. There were doubts about whether they could play before the match started, because of the injuries they had sustained earlier, but they both passed fitness tests. Though Andrew Strauss succumbed in the tenth over, England lost no further wickets before lunch, and only one more before tea. There were many missed opportunities for Australia, who dropped Trescothick, Michael Vaughan (twice) and Ian Bell on the first day, which helped Trescothick and Vaughan to get a partnership of 137 before Trescothick was dismissed after lunch. Vaughan powered on, making his hundred after 206 minutes to become the first man in the series to get a century.\nHaving made 166 runs, an innings described as \"majestic\", Vaughan eventually hit Simon Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary, but had still made what was to be the highest individual score in the series. Together with Vaughan, Australia were also faced with a more defiant Bell, who had not passed 25 in his four first innings in the series, but made 59 before the day ended. Picking up where Vaughan left off, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed out the day for England with the scoreboard reading 341 for 5, with Lee adding two wickets to the tally before the end of the day.\nDay 2\nBell did not add to his overnight score, being given out caught behind in controversial circumstances, as replays indicated any contact with the ball involved neither bat nor glove. Following a brief rain interval England then lost two more wickets just before lunch, Andrew Flintoff after scoring a quick-fire 46 and Geraint Jones for 42. After lunch Australia quickly dispatched the remaining two wickets for just a further 10 runs, bowling England out for a score of 444, with McGrath finishing on his worst-ever Test figures of nought for 86.\nAustralia started their innings tentatively with Hoggard dropping a low catch from Matthew Hayden off his own bowling. Just before tea Australia lost their first wicket with Hayden out caught at short leg from Ashley Giles first over. After tea Australia lost another couple of wickets, Ricky Ponting caught for seven and Hayden given out lbw for 34. Gilchrist put on 30 before edging the first ball of Simon Jones' spell to Geraint Jones.\nThis brought in Michael Clarke who had been recuperating at the team hotel after damaging his back on the first day. Owing to this injury, Clarke needed Hayden to act as a runner. Warne made inroads with the bat, just as at Edgbaston four days previously, but Clarke only managed to add seven runs before being deceived by a reverse swinging delivery from Simon Jones. Warne and Jason Gillespie saw the day out with Warne finishing on 45 not out.\nThe day finished with Australia on 214 for 7, 230 behind and needing another 31 runs to avoid a follow-on. The score was adjusted from 210 overnight owing to an umpire failing to signal four byes.\nDay 3\nRain delayed the start of play until 16:00 BST, and even then only eight overs were possible before play was again suspended, although a further six overs were bowled later on before yet more rain meant that play was abandoned for the day. Australia had the better of the short day's play, adding 50 runs without loss to pass the follow-on target, although Warne was lucky to survive on two occasions thanks to errors by Geraint Jones: with Warne on 55, Jones missed a relatively straightforward stumping opportunity, and on 68 he was dropped after edging a ball from Flintoff. Australia closed on 264 for 7, still 180 in arrears, but England probably felt that they missed several opportunities to put the game beyond their opponents.\nDay 4\nHaving been hampered by a rain-shortened day three, the Australians were ready to put more wood to the ball on day four, and they did not disappoint. Warne continued his march towards his maiden Test century before holing out with a hook shot to a well-placed Giles at 90. Simon Jones mopped up the other two wickets to bowl Australia out for 302, Jones finishing the innings with a career best figures of six for 53.\nThe English opening partnership of Strauss and Trescothick began their response, scoring 26 before lunch. After lunch, Trescothick played on to be bowled after scoring 41 giving McGrath his first wicket of the match. Strauss put together a fine century, his sixth from just 17 matches, scoring 106 before getting out caught. Gilchrist missed two stumping opportunities to remove Bell and failing to hold a catch to remove Flintoff. Bell capitalised on Gilchrist's errors, partnering Strauss for 28 overs and recording a well-deserved 65. Geraint Jones also added a swift 27 with England more concerned about scoring quickly than staying at the crease, and England declared on 280 to give them a spell at Australia in the evening and a chance of winning the match the next day. McGrath recorded another five-wicket haul in an innings, but was expensive, giving away 115 runs. Warne, despite bowling 25 overs, failed to take a wicket, recording figures of 0/74.\nAustralia needed 423 to win, which would be a record fourth innings total to win a match. Australia saw out the last 10 overs without losing a wicket and put on 24 runs, leaving 399.\nDay 5\nEnglish hopes of a win were high, and 20,000 people were locked out of the stadium in addition to the 23,000 capacity crowd. Australia started the day needing 399 more runs from 98 overs if they were to claim an unlikely victory. The day started poorly for them with Justin Langer falling for 14 on the seventh ball of the day, nicking a ball delivered by Hoggard behind to Geraint Jones. Ponting narrowly survived being run out early on and this proved crucial in the context of the match as the momentum gradually swung in Australia's direction. At one point Australia racked up runs at such a rate that a win became a real possibility. Despite losing Clarke and Gillespie in quick succession to send the team to 264 for 7, Ponting battled on before eventually succumbing to Steve Harmison after seven hours at the crease to record the first Australian century of the series with a score of 156. This was good enough to earn Man of the Match honours.\nAfter the dismissal of Ponting, Australia were 354 for 9 with only four overs remaining, and another thrilling climax occurred with England having a real chance of snatching victory in similar fashion to the second Test. However, the unfancied pairing of Lee and McGrath handled the remaining 24 deliveries to finish on 371 for 9, 52 short of victory but sufficient to draw the game and leave the series tied at 1–1.\nFourth Test.\nDay 1\nGlenn McGrath was once again ruled out because of injury, this time to his elbow, and Australia also dropped the out-of-form Jason Gillespie, leaving them with a seam attack of Brett Lee, debutant Shaun Tait and Michael Kasprowicz. England, having been on top in the last two Tests, were unchanged.\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat, and they got off to a strong start. Boosted by no-balls from the seamers – a total of 18 before lunch – Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss scored runs quickly and easily, and enjoyed batting on a pitch which gave the bowlers no aid. They recorded their second 100-run opening partnership of the series, before Strauss was freakishly dismissed for 35, sweeping Shane Warne onto his boot and into Matthew Hayden's waiting hands at slip – a wicket confirmed by the third umpire. Michael Vaughan continued on his fine form from Old Trafford, though, punishing bad balls from Lee to go into lunch with his score on 14. Trescothick, meanwhile, rode his luck, as he was bowled off a no-ball on 55, much to Lee's displeasure. At lunch England were 129 for 1.\nOnly 3.1 overs were possible in the afternoon session, owing to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Tait, who used the cloud cover to good effect and swung the ball well. However, Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards the end of the day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket – that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.\nDay 2\nAustralia dismissed Pietersen at the beginning of the morning's play, edging a full outswinger from Lee through to wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist. But an unbeaten century partnership from Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones took England's score to 344 for 5 at lunch.\nAfter lunch, the pair continued to score quickly for another hour, and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit runs through the off side on the way to his highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones – including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off – saw England to 477 all out at tea.\nIn the evening session, England's bowlers, especially Hoggard, managed to find much more swing than the Australian bowlers had done, and ripped through the Australian top order. The first three wickets fell in a crucial period of 11 balls (although the third, which dismissed Damien Martyn lbw, was a poor decision – television replays indicated that the ball hit the bat before the body). By stumps Australia had been reduced to 99 for 5 to complete an excellent day for England.\nDay 3\nKatich and Gilchrist decided that attack was the best form of defence, adding 58 in only 8.5 overs in the morning, before England came back to take the next four wickets for the addition of only 18 runs, leaving Australia perilously placed at 175 for 9. Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Jones' bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.\nVaughan then gambled, by enforcing the follow-on on the visitors (the first time Australia had followed on in 17 years and 190 Tests, as they had not been made to follow on since facing Pakistan in Karachi in 1988). By lunch, Australia had reached 14 without loss in their second innings, and they powered on in the afternoon session, only losing Hayden and adding 100 more runs before tea. For England, the afternoon session was their worst of the match – to compound their misery, Simon Jones showed signs of injury, and Strauss dropped Justin Langer on 38.\nIn the evening session, England managed to take three wickets, but also dropped a catch and missed a stumping. Australia thus finished the day still 37 runs in arrears but with six wickets still in hand. Simon Jones also went off the field during the evening session with an ankle injury, and was taken to hospital for an ankle scan. While Jones was off the field receiving attention, substitute fielder Gary Pratt ran out Australia captain Ponting. As he left the field, Ponting expressed his displeasure to the England dressing room at their frequent use of subs (allegedly to keep their key bowlers fresh). Although this tactic was widely felt by commentators to be against the spirit of the game, there was no legal stipulation against it. In fact, Pratt was on the field owing to a genuinely serious injury to Simon Jones, and he never played international cricket again.\nDay 4\nDay Four began in earnest with Michael Clarke and Katich continuing their partnership from the previous day. However, Katich had already twice flirted with dismissal, saved only by chance both times. In the words of BBC cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, \"It's very much a game of chess – white-flannelled figures on green grass.\" The English and the Australians proceeded into a cold war for a good part of the morning, with England attempting to frustrate the Australian batting, but with the latter refusing to take the bait. England's lead slowly evaporated without a wicket falling, but Hoggard's taking of Clarke's and then Gilchrist's scalps on either side of the lunch break swung the initiative back into England's hands.\nThe injury to Simon Jones became somewhat obvious as the pacers struggled to capture the magic that Jones had created the previous day that had forced Australia to follow on. Despite this, the Australian run rate remained low as both sides stared each other down. Mistakes by Geraint Jones and Pietersen were quickly nullified by the dismissal of Warne for 45 and Kasprowicz for 19, and after a few overs' resistance, Tait was bowled middle stump for 4, leaving 129 for the English to chase after tea.\nEngland then proceeded to send the game into a nailbiter; Trescothick started the chase positively, scoring 27 from 22 balls, out of 32 scored while he was at the crease. Then English wickets fell quickly as Warne took three wickets: Trescothick, Vaughan (0) and Strauss (23). Lee dismissed Ian Bell (3) and at 57 for 4 England were in trouble. Flintoff (26) and Pietersen (23) then steadied the ship with an invaluable partnership of 46 before both fell in quick succession to Lee. Despite Geraint Jones' dismissal by Warne for 3, the partnership of Ashley Giles (7 not out) and Hoggard (8 not out) guided England home. Man of the match honours went to Flintoff, but more importantly this gave the English a crucial 2–1 lead heading back to London for the fifth and final Test, ensuring that they could not lose the series. However, with the Ashes going to Australia in the event of a drawn series, there was still all to play for at The Oval.\nFifth Test.\nTeam changes\nAustralia named Glenn McGrath, recovered from an elbow injury, to replace Michael Kasprowicz. England's Simon Jones did not recover from his ankle injury from the previous Test in time to be included in the England team, and was replaced after much speculation by all-rounder Paul Collingwood, in preference to specialist fast bowler James Anderson.\nDay 1\nThe final match to decide the fate of the legendary Ashes urn finally began, and the proverbial first blood was drawn by England as Michael Vaughan won his third toss of the series (much to the delight of the partisan Oval crowd). Vaughan elected to have his side bat first, and the English first innings got underway. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 82 for the first wicket, as England's batsmen looked to take on the Australians, but subtle spin variations bowled from Shane Warne yielded three wickets as England went to lunch on 115 for 3.\nWarne continued after lunch by taking the wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Strauss, before to falling to McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his second century of the series, before being dismissed by Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was thought, might wipe up to a day of action or more from the ledger.\nDay 2\nDay two began positively for the Australians, with Jones being bowled for 25 off Brett Lee, and Matthew Hoggard managing a meagre 2 before being dismissed by McGrath. However, Giles and Steve Harmison frustrated the Australians by taking the score past 370, before Warne trapped Giles lbw shortly before midday, leaving England all out for 373.\nThe Australian first innings got off to a solid start, with Justin Langer forging a 100 partnership with fellow opener Matthew Hayden – the first opening-partnership century of the series by the Australians. Langer played some blistering strokes off Giles' bowling in particular, but survived a sharp chance to Trescothick at first slip. The Australians were offered the light immediately after tea, despite the English protesting and wanting to bowl Giles. The Australians surprised many by accepting the umpires' offer – many thought that, given they needed to win the test to retain the Ashes, they would want to use as much time available for batting as possible – and the light never improved, with light rain coming down later. Thus, the day concluded with Australia 112/0, 261 runs behind England.\nDay 3\nAfter a delay for wet field conditions, the third day began with a flurry of action, as both Langer and Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays suggested should have been out, and shies at the stumps that just missed. However, no batsman was given out in the morning session, where only 14 overs of play was possible, owing to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.\nAfter lunch Hayden and Langer continued their solid batting, frustrating the England bowlers, with Langer reaching his 22nd Test century. Shortly afterwards, England gained a minor victory as Harmison dismissed Langer, who departed to a rapturous ovation. Ricky Ponting should then have been dismissed for a bat-pad catch off Giles, but Bowden turned down the appeal. Hayden also achieved three-figure success later in the day – his first century for over a year, while Flintoff's hostile and accurate bowling was rewarded with the wicket of Ponting, caught at slip by Strauss. With this wicket, Flintoff equalled Ian Botham's hitherto unique achievement of 300 runs and 20 wickets in an Ashes series. Flintoff had a later appeal for a catch behind turned down by Rudi Koertzen, despite it hitting the bat.\nThe Australian batsmen once again surprisingly ended the day early by accepting another offer of bad light, bringing a much-interrupted day to a close after only 45.4 overs. Thanks to dogged batting and at least four umpiring decisions in their favour on the third day, they finished 96 runs behind with eight wickets of their first innings intact.\nDay 4\nThe fourth day started brightly for England, Damien Martyn hooking a short ball from Flintoff straight into the hands of Collingwood, in the third over of the day, having added only one to his overnight score of nine. Further wickets fell, with an excellent knock by Hayden been brought to an end by Flintoff, who continued with impetus and trapped Katich lbw for 1, before Hoggard had Adam Gilchrist lbw with an inswinger at the stroke of lunch. Gilchrist, however, had added a quick 23 that could be vital, as Australia went into the pavilion 17 runs behind with four wickets in hand.\nHowever, it only took six post-lunch overs for England to end the Australian effort. Jones dropped a catch off Michael Clarke's bat, but it did not prove to be crucial, as Clarke was lbw to Hoggard in the next over. Warne and McGrath both went for ducks, caught off a mistimed hook and in the slips respectively. Finally Hoggard had Lee (6) caught in the deep and Australia were bowled out for 367. Flintoff finished with five wickets, the second five-for of his career, while Hoggard's four for 97 was his best return of the series.\nThus England, who had expected to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took a very quick wicket, that of Strauss, who was dismissed again by Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play, owing to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.\nDay 5\nThe fifth day began with the game still finely balanced. Ponting put his trust in his two proven wicket takers: McGrath and Warne. England batted well for 40 minutes, with Vaughan taking the game to the Australian bowlers, but McGrath produced two beautiful outswingers to dismiss him and Ian Bell (for a pair) with consecutive deliveries. McGrath appeared to have secured a hat-trick by having Pietersen caught by Ponting in the slips off the top edge of his bat, but despite a furious appeal, umpire Bowden correctly adjudged that the ball had hit Pietersen's shoulder. The Australian charge was diminished by a couple of uncharacteristic dropped catches by Hayden at slip off the bowling of Warne, and then Warne putting down a simple chance at slip off Lee, but Warne and McGrath combined to take four wickets before lunch, leaving England 133 runs ahead with five wickets remaining.\nThe afternoon session was anchored by Pietersen, the beneficiary of three dropped catches, who scored his maiden Test century, with obdurate support from Collingwood and Giles. The session saw only two wickets fall, Collingwood was caught acrobatically by silly mid-off Ponting for 10, and Jones (1) decisively bowled when he was deceived by a rapid Shaun Tait delivery. Pietersen was finally dismissed for 158, a superlative innings including 15 fours and 7 sixes, while Giles added 59 and Harmison was dismissed for a duck to bring Australia in to bat with fewer than 19 overs remaining.\nAs the Australians began their innings, it was clear that not enough time remained for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. Australia had scored just four leg byes in their second innings, making it the only innings in Test cricket history in which every run was an extra. With this fifth and final Test declared as a draw, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes they had lost in 1989 and securing a first series win since 1986–87.\nPietersen, having scored his maiden Test century at such a crucial point in the match and series, was voted Man of the Match by Channel 4 viewers. Flintoff was chosen by Australia coach John Buchanan as England's Man of the Series while England coach Duncan Fletcher selected Warne for Australia. The new Compton–Miller Medal for the overall man of the series (as selected by each side's chairman of selectors: Trevor Hohns and David Graveney) was also presented to Flintoff. Finally, the replica urn was presented to Vaughan, thus ending the series in favour of the home side.\nLegacy.\nPost-match reactions.\nImmediately following the final match, Elizabeth II sent a congratulatory memo to Michael Vaughan and the team, saying: \"My warmest congratulations to you, the England cricket team and all in the squad for the magnificent achievement of regaining the Ashes... both sides can take credit for giving us all such a wonderfully exciting and entertaining summer of cricket at its best.\"\nPolitical leaders like Prime Minister Tony Blair, Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also sent their congratulations. Blair stated that \"By bringing the Ashes back after so long, you have given cricket a huge boost and lit up the whole summer\".\nHoward added \"... Vaughan, his team, and all involved, should be proud of this achievement and the manner in which they have played during this extraordinary summer of excitement and tension.\"\n\"England's victory is historic, and I send hearty congratulations to the team... It has been impossible not to get caught up by the excitement and sense of good will in the past few days,\" stated Kennedy.\nOn the other end of the ledger, Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard (who was in New York for a UN summit and was given the bad news by an aide during a luncheon with the Asia Society) was gracious in his congratulations to England.\n\"Look, there's natural disappointment but it's a situation where you give credit to the team that won,\" Howard stated, noting that there would not be a national day of mourning. \"They will no doubt celebrate and that will be difficult for some, but that's the nature of these contests and we should not take anything away from England...They played very well. It's the best team that England has had for a very long period of time.\"\nEngland team parade.\nOn 13 September, England, along with their Women's Ashes-winning counterparts, were feted with a 90-minute bus tour from Mansion House to Trafalgar Square, where they were greeted by tens of thousands of Londoners and cricket fans in a celebration of their momentous achievements (to the surprise of Matthew Hoggard, who expected \"three men and a dog\").\nThousands of people also lined the streets along the parade route as the two buses made their way to Trafalgar Square. While the rest of the team simply enjoyed the sights, 5th Test Man-of-the-Match Kevin Pietersen sprayed champagne from the bus onto joyous revelers on the street, while wicketkeeper Geraint Jones held onto a Dalek doll with the words \"Australians exterminated\" attached to it.\nAt Trafalgar Square, the crowd was treated to a victory celebration for both England teams, and before the ceremony closed the square broke into a rendition of \"Jerusalem\", which had become an unofficial hymn for the team during the 5th Test. Interviews were carried out with all members of the men's team and Clare Connor, the captain of the women's team, by David Gower and Mark Nicholas, while the ceremony was broadcast live in the UK on BBC One, Channel 4 and Sky Sports News and around the world. Afterwards, the side was entertained by the Prime Minister as guests of honour at 10 Downing Street, then returned the urn to its sacred home at Lord's for safekeeping.\nAustralian criticism.\nAlmost immediately criticism began in Australia; \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" immediately took issue with the fact that not only was captain Ricky Ponting out-thought by his opposite number Vaughan but the side was too old and simply did not score the runs when they were needed. \"The Age\" of Melbourne criticised the team for opening their big mouths once too often, hitting at Australia's earlier whitewash boast. Psychological warfare, \"The Age\" went on to state, is great when it works but when it backfires those who are responsible ought to be brought to account.\nFormer fast bowler Dennis Lillee was particularly scathing. Writing in Perth's \"The West Australian\", he stated that all who perpetrated this \"disaster\" must be sacked and Shane Warne be appointed the captain in place of Ponting (because of how Warne had delivered time and again in the series). Losing to other sides is not the end of the world, stated Lillee, but losing the Ashes is.\nFormer captain Steve Waugh defended the side, calling it \"a very good side, a really experienced side. They will be disappointed but they will move on from it\" he said, but also conceding that the selectors were likely to ponder a few changes given that only three of the Australia team at The Oval were aged under 30. \"They'll have a couple of players in mind which they will bring in the side over the next couple of years\".\nAlong with Waugh, selector and former batsman David Boon defended their selections. \"Sometimes you're going to have to make a hard decision to keep a subtle rotation going through so you don't have mass retirements...But you've also got to pick the best cricket team you possibly can to represent your country\", he stated. \"If we keep producing cricketers who are 25 plus, they're mature, they're ready to play, they've still got a seven or eight-year career, then we're doing OK.\"\nPonting hits back, the axe falls.\nPonting was confronted by a large media pack shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport and said he wasn't aware of Lillee's comments. \"I'm not concerned about those things. As long as I am doing the right thing by everyone in my dressing room as the team and the coaching staff, well then that's all I can do... But as long as I am looking after the guys in my dressing room, then I'll be happy,\" Ponting stated, adding that he wished to remain captain.\nPonting also responded to Lillee's comments that Warne should be captain, and that he made more decisions than Ponting during the series: \"I like to talk to a lot of guys out on the field and use their ideas and thoughts. I'll go to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) and even Matty Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn... The way I think is not going to be right 100 percent of the time, but that's the way I do it. Warne has got a cricket brain as good as anybody around. But I wouldn't agree [he was the pseudo captain].\"\nRegardless, when the Australian side for the ICC Super Series was announced, three members of the Ashes-losing side were dropped: Damien Martyn was retained only for the ODI squad, while Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were dropped altogether. Brad Hodge, Stuart MacGill and Shane Watson were added in their places. While Cricket Australia officials assured that these omissions were not a signal that the Test careers of these three players were over, many experts said otherwise. However, all three players made successful returns to the Test team in early 2006. Lillee once again called for the replacement of Ponting as captain with Warne after the squad announcement, however this was once again rejected.\nEngland's epilogue.\nWith England's victory in the series, the top of the ICC Test Championship rankings ladder changed slightly as the English closed in on the top-ranked Aussies. In a BBC interview the week after the series, Simon Jones claimed that the English should one day be regarded as the best, despite statistics and the Test Championship rankings speaking otherwise.\n\"The Ashes series was talked about so much. People were wondering if England could do it and Glenn McGrath said Australia would win 5–0, but we beat them 2–1 and could have been 3–1 up after Old Trafford,\" Jones told the BBC. \"Australia are statistically the best side in the world, and rightly so. They've played so much great cricket over the past 10 years and built up an advantage on the points system... But I think that's changing and hopefully we will have the mantle one day.\"\nMeanwhile, as Pakistan and India prepared for the Ashes winners' visit in the winter, with the Pakistanis relishing the opportunity to test their mettle against the side that took down the Australians, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer stated, \"England have done well but they have still to create that aura of invincibility of the West Indies of the 1970s and 80s and Australia recently. The side which does well in all three departments will win the series and we have to be very disciplined against England, who have quality batsmen and bowlers.\" Pakistan would later defeat England at home with a 2–0 margin.\nFollowing their performances in the series both Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan were given the Freedom of the City in their home towns of Preston and Sheffield.\nOn 29 September, the Royal Mail issued a set of stamps commemorating the Ashes victory. The set included two first-class stamps and two worth 68 pence each, the cost of posting a letter to Australia.\nIn the 2006 New Year Honours, 11 of the 12 playing members of the England team were awarded the MBE, with captain Vaughan awarded the OBE, for their roles in the successful Ashes victory. There was some critical comment that the limited role of some did not warrant the honour.\nHowever, after the following series in which Australia regained the Ashes in a 5–0 whitewash, the English public began to criticise the celebrations of the previous year. This issue also flared up during the Test series when Warne commented on Paul Collingwood's MBE for scoring 17 runs during the 2005 series. Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott criticised the fact that the MBE had been awarded to the whole side when Warne, who had already taken over 600 wickets by then, had not been honoured."

        "text": "The 2011 Rugby World Cup, was the seventh Rugby World Cup, a quadrennial international rugby union competition inaugurated in 1987. The International Rugby Board (IRB) selected New Zealand as the host country in preference to Japan and South Africa at a meeting in Dublin on 17 November 2005. The tournament was won by New Zealand, who defeated France 8–7 in the final. The defending champions, South Africa, were eliminated by Australia 11–9 in the quarter-finals. The result marked the third time that the tournament was won by the country that hosted the event (following New Zealand in 1987 and South Africa in 1995).\nIt was the largest sporting event ever held in New Zealand, eclipsing the 1987 Rugby World Cup, 1990 Commonwealth Games, 1992 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 America's Cup. Overseas visitors to New Zealand for the event totalled 133,000, more than the 95,000 that the organisers expected. However, there was a drop in non-event visitors, meaning the net increase in visitors over the previous year was less than 80,000.\nThe games ran over six weeks, commencing on 9 September 2011 with the opening ceremony showcasing New Zealand's history and diverse cultures. The final was played at Eden Park in Auckland on 23 October 2011, a date chosen because it fell on a long weekend of New Zealand's Labour Day holiday.\nAfter speculation that the number of participating teams would be reduced to 16, the IRB announced on 30 November 2007 that the 2011 tournament would again feature 20 teams. Twelve teams qualified as a result of finishing in the top three in each pool in the 2007 tournament. The remaining eight berths were determined by regional qualifying tournaments. Of the 20 countries that competed in the previous World Cup in 2007, there was only one change – Russia replaced Portugal.\nHost selection.\nThree nations bid to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup – New Zealand, Japan, and South Africa.\nNew Zealand had co-hosted the first Rugby World Cup with Australia in 1987, and had been set to co-host the 2003 World Cup with Australia before a disagreement over ground signage rights resulted in New Zealand being dropped and Australia became the sole host. The 2011 New Zealand bid contained plans to enlarge the size of Eden Park and other stadiums to help increase the commercial viability of the bid.\nJapan was bidding to become the first Asian nation to host the first Rugby World Cup. Japan had the necessary infrastructure already in place, by virtue of its co-hosting the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nSouth Africa had hosted the tournament in 1995. The 2011 South African bid, led by former national captain Francois Pienaar, had strong support from their national government. South Africa had also won the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nThe IRB Council meeting in Dublin on 17 November 2005 announced that New Zealand had been selected after IRB inspections of each applicant host nation during June and July 2005.\nPreparations.\nCosts and benefits.\nThe event was expected to cost about NZ$310 million to run and to generate NZ$280 million in ticket sales. In Auckland, the city where many of the most important games took place, the costs to the local ratepayers alone was estimated at $102 million.\nTicket sales exceeding NZ$285 million, accommodation-related spending of another NZ$260 million, and NZ$236 million spent on food and drink was expected to provide a significant fiscal stimulus, of nearly 1.4% of the quarterly GDP.\nConcerns.\nIn the years between winning the bid and the staging of the event, New Zealand news media and social agencies cast aspersions on the nation's readiness and appropriate use of national funds for sports infrastructure, as has happened with most large, international, quadrennial, multi-location sporting events of recent decades such as the 2012 Olympics, 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Concerns were raised about the process of upgrading Eden Park to expand the capacity to the 60,000 required by the IRB. In late 2008 Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully said the remaining consent process might need to be overridden by legislation for the work to be completed on time.\nA July 2009 report by the Auckland Regional Transport Authority, released under the Official Information Act, warned of lack of readiness and complacency, despite the fact that \"the levels of patron movement and operational standard [needed for the RWC] are in reality significantly above what is currently delivered.\" The report was dismissed by Michael Barnett, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce CEO and planning co-coordinator for RWC events in Auckland, who characterised it as a case of \"a Wellington media organisation us[ing] an outdated report\".\nThe nation's largest hospitality workers' union, Unite, which represents 25% of hotel, restaurant and casino workers in New Zealand, demanded that workers share in windfall profits and said there was the possibility of a strike during the tournament.\nThe construction of Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium, known during the tournament as Otago Stadium, was a source of concern as the project was operating in a tight time frame. An April 2010 progress report stated that the project remained on target for completion prior to the Rugby World Cup, although there was a medium level of risk with some significant and potentially damaging concerns. If the project had not been completed on time, organisers would have reverted to Carisbrook as the backup option. Forsyth Barr Stadium was officially opened on 6 August 2011.\nDamage caused by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake forced the relocation of a number of cup matches, including the quarter-finals.\nWarm-up matches.\nThe 2011 Tri Nations Series was shortened to include only six games instead of the usual nine. It served as the primary preparation for the tournament for Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In the northern hemisphere, a series of friendlies played in August 2011 replaced the annual tours to the southern hemisphere. North American entrants Canada beat USA in two warm-up friendlies in August 2011.\nQualifying.\nTwenty teams competed in the 2011 World Cup. Twelve teams qualified by finishing in the top three of their pool in the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nTwelve of the nations at this tournament had competed in every previous Rugby World Cup – Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland, and Wales. All the other sides also had previous World Cup experience, except for Russia who appeared in a Rugby World Cup for the first time.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 20 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, qualified for the final tournament.\nVenues.\nThe 13 venues for the 2011 Rugby World Cup were confirmed on 12 March 2009. A number of the venues were redeveloped to increase capacity for the event. The Government considered passing a law bypassing the consent process to allow all the stadiums' redevelopment to be completed in time.\nDue to damage to Stadium Christchurch and many other facilities in Christchurch caused by the earthquake on 22 February 2011, it was announced on 16 March that the matches to be played in the city would be relocated. The two quarter-finals scheduled would be moved to Auckland, while the five pool matches moved to other centres.\nOn 10 November 2006, the New Zealand Government announced plans for Stadium New Zealand in Auckland. The proposal was to build the new stadium seating 70,000 on the waterfront. After much public outcry, and lack of support from the Auckland Regional Council, the proposal was dropped in favour of the redevelopment of Eden Park. The redevelopment of Eden Park's Southern and South Western stands was completed during 2010.\nDunedin's new stadium, Forsyth Barr Stadium (known as Otago Stadium during the tournament), was completed in August 2011 and was used instead of Carisbrook.\nDraw.\nSeeding of teams for the 2011 World Cup was based on their respective IRB World Rankings. The top four at the 2007 Rugby World Cup (South Africa, England, Argentina, and France) were not therefore allocated top pool spots, but \"the rankings are now very well established and provide us with a credible and succinct way of seeding teams for the rugby World Cup pool draw\", according to Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL) chairman Syd Millar.\nThe draw was conducted in December 2008 and used the World Rankings as of 1 December 2008, after the Northern Hemisphere Autumn internationals. The teams were placed into three bands depending on their seedings at the time, with one team from each band in each of the pools. The rankings and bands were therefore: New Zealand (1), South Africa (2), Australia (3) and Argentina (4); Wales (5), England (6), France (7) and Ireland (8); Scotland (9), Fiji (10), Italy (11) and Tonga (12).\nThe full draw and venues for the tournament were announced on 12 March 2009.\nThe opening match saw the hosts, New Zealand, take on Tonga.\nBy coincidence, the final match and third-place playoff match were between the countries which contested the same matches at the first Rugby World Cup, which were also held in New Zealand, in 1987.\nSquads.\nEach country was allowed a squad of 30 players for the tournament. These squads were to be submitted to the International Rugby Board by a deadline of 22 August 2011. Once the squad was submitted a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. There is also a stand-down period of 72 hours before the new player is allowed to take the field. Hence, a replacement player called into a squad on the eve of a game will not be permitted to play in that game.\nMatch officials.\nOn 8 April 2011, the IRB named ten referees, seven assistant referees and four television match officials to handle the pool stage games. Two of the seven assistants will also be reserve referees if required.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony for the 2011 Rugby World Cup took place at Eden Park in Auckland on 9 September 2011 at 19:30 (NZST). The ceremony featured a blend of traditional Māori and modern New Zealand culture, and began with a fleet of 26 waka entering the city harbour. It featured traditional haka and sipi tau dances in reference to the opening match between New Zealand and Tonga, and ended with a large pyrotechnics display.\nPool stage.\nThe first round, or pool stage, saw the twenty teams divided into four pools of five teams using the same format that was used in 2003 and in 2007. Each pool was a round-robin of ten games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four or more tries in one match scored a bonus point, as did a team losing by seven or fewer points.\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each pool advanced to the quarter-finals. The top three teams of each pool have automatically qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nIf two or more teams were tied on match points, the following tiebreakers would have applied:\nStatistics.\nThe tournament's top point scorer was South African Morné Steyn, who scored 62 points. Chris Ashton and Vincent Clerc scored the most tries, six in total.\nPlayers of the tournament.\nFollowing the completion of the Rugby World Cup, the IRB's Rugby News Service listed the Top 5 players of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. These players were:\nBroadcasting.\nSky Network Television, New Zealand's largest subscription television provider, was host broadcaster for the Rugby World Cup, transmitting all matches live and in high-definition coverage. Games were also available on free-to-air networks in New Zealand, but not all pool matches were screened live on free-to-air. Broadcasting rights were allocated throughout the world by the IRB, including highlights, free-to-air and pay-per-view."

        "text": "The Netherlands men's national cricket team (), usually referred as \"The Flying Dutchmen \" is a team that represents the Netherlands in men's international cricket and is administered by the Royal Dutch Cricket Association.\nCricket has been played in the Netherlands since at least the 19th century, and in the 1860s was considered a major sport in the country. Other sports – notably football and field hockey – have long since surpassed cricket in popularity amongst the Dutch, but today there are around 6,000 cricketers in the Netherlands. The first national association, the forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Cricket Association, was formed in 1890 and the Netherlands achieved Associate Membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1966.\nThe Netherlands have taken part in all eleven ICC Trophy/World Cup Qualifier tournaments, winning the competition in Canada in 2001 and finishing as runners-up thrice (in 1986, 1990 and 2023). The Netherlands also participated in the 1996, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2023 Cricket World Cups, and from 1995 onwards the national team entered the English domestic NatWest Trophy competition (and its successor, the C&amp;G Trophy). In 2004 they played first-class cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, drawing with Scotland in Aberdeen and then suffering from an innings defeat against Ireland in Deventer.\nThe Netherlands enjoyed full One Day International status from 1 January 2006 until 1 February 2014. They regained Twenty20 International status in June 2014, having played their first match in this format in 2008. The Netherlands regained their ODI status after the conclusion of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in March 2018. They had guaranteed this status before the tournament as a result of winning the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship and thus qualifying for the 2020–23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, and retained the status until the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Netherlands and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status. Scott Edwards is the current team captain.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nCricket was introduced to the Netherlands by British soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century. Further clubs came into existence in the 1870s. The Netherlands national team played their first game in 1881. They fielded 22 players against an Uxbridge Cricket Club XI, but still lost by an innings. The Dutch Cricket Union was formed in 1890, with 18 member clubs, four of which are still in existence today.\nThe first national tournament was held the following year, and was won by Haagsche CC. English touring teams then began visiting in 1890 including one in 1891 that featured the author of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nIn 1894, the Gentlemen of Holland were the first Dutch team to visit England. The tour included a game against the MCC at Lord's, which the MCC won by an innings and 169 runs. Tours by English sides continued for the rest of the 1890s, which also saw the emergence of Carst Posthuma, who was later the first Dutch player to play first class cricket. He took 2339 wickets at an average of 8.66 in his career in the Netherlands.\n1900s to 1910s.\n1901 saw another visit to England by the Gentlemen of Holland. They played five games on the tour, drawing two and losing the remainder. 1905 saw the first international game against Belgium, which finished in a draw. Cricket began a decline in popularity in the first decade of the 20th century, particularly amongst young athletes, due, in part, to the Dutch sympathizing with the Boers in the Boer War and therefore not being attracted to a game with links to England.\nIn 1910, the Dutch team visited Belgium to take part in an exhibition tournament, which also featured the MCC, Belgium and France. They lost to the MCC by 2 wickets, and to France by 63 runs, but beat Belgium by 116 runs.\nDuring World War I, in which the Netherlands remained neutral, large numbers of British officers were interned in the country, and many of these joined local cricket clubs. A team made up of these players even won the Dutch championship in 1918.\n1920s to 1940s.\nThe Flamingos, a Dutch touring side, was formed in 1921, and later made several tours of England. Tours by English teams also continued in this period. The 1930s are said to be the heyday of Dutch cricket. In 1934, the first Dutch women's league was formed, and the women's national team played two games against Australia in 1937, losing heavily in both. Cricket was of course curtailed after the German invasion in 1940.\n1950s to 1980s.\nThe 1950s saw visits to the Netherlands by Australia and the West Indies, in addition to their first match against Denmark. In 1958, the Cricket Board received a Royal Charter, and became the \"Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond\", a name which it retains to this day.\nIn August 1964, the Netherlands achieved their first victory against a Test-playing nation when they beat Australia by three wickets at The Hague. They were rewarded with associate membership of the ICC two years later.\nThe first two ICC Trophy tournaments, in 1979 and 1982, brought little success to the Dutch, who were eliminated in the first round in both tournaments. But in the 1986 tournament, they finished as runners-up to Zimbabwe. The same year, Paul-Jan Bakker became the first Dutch player to play county cricket. In 1989, the Dutch beat a strong England XI that included two future England captains, Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain, by 3 runs.\n1990s.\nIn 1990 the Netherlands hosted the ICC Trophy, the first such tournament outside England, and again finished runners-up to Zimbabwe. In 1991 they achieved a five-wicket win over a West Indies XI, followed in 1993 by a seven-wicket win over an England XI and in 1994 a nine-wicket win over a South Africa XI. In 1994 the Dutch finally qualified for the World Cup, after finishing third in that year's ICC Trophy. In the World Cup itself in 1996, they were eliminated in the first round, but performed with some credit in their game against England.\n1995 saw the Netherlands enter the NatWest Trophy for the first time. They took part in this tournament for ten years, and their best performance came in 1999 when they reached the fourth round, beating Durham along the way.\nThe Netherlands failed to qualify for the 1999 World Cup, as they could only manage sixth in the 1997 ICC Trophy. However, the country hosted one World Cup match, between Kenya and South Africa at Amstelveen.\nThe Netherlands competed in the first European Championship in 1996, coming second. They have competed in every tournament since, winning in 1998 and 2000.\n21st century.\n2000–2009.\n2001 finally saw the Netherlands win the ICC Trophy, beating Namibia in the final in Toronto. They thus qualified for the 2003 World Cup. They again failed to progress beyond the first round in the tournament, but recorded their first one-day international win over Namibia during the tournament. Feiko Kloppenburg (with 121) and Klaas-Jan van Noortwijk (134 not out) scored the first two One Day International centuries in the side's history.\nIn the 2005 ICC Trophy, the Netherlands finished 5th, qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and gaining one-day International status until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. Their first one-day international with this new status was scheduled to be against Kenya in March 2006; however this match was cancelled due to a Kenyan tour of Bangladesh. Instead their first ODI with this status (and their twelfth overall) came against Sri Lanka; this was their first ODI at home. However Sri Lanka won the two match series 2–0, with a then-record ODI score of 443–9.\nThe Dutch played their first Intercontinental Cup match of 2006 against Kenya in Nairobi in March. The game was drawn, but the Netherlands gained six points for a first innings lead. In August, the Netherlands competed in Division One of the European Championship. They beat Denmark and Italy, but lost to Scotland and their game against Ireland was rained off. They finished third in the tournament.\nIn November, the Dutch travelled to South Africa. They first played an Intercontinental Cup match against Bermuda: David Hemp achieved what was then a competition record score of 247 not out in the drawn match. This was followed by a triangular series against Bermuda and Canada, which they won. Their final game of 2006, also in South Africa, was an Intercontinental Cup game against Canada. They won the match by 7 wickets, with Ryan ten Doeschate setting a new competition record individual score of 259 not out.\nIn early 2007, they travelled to Nairobi, Kenya to take part in Division One of the World Cricket League, finishing third out of six. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, where they were eliminated in the first round, though they did beat Scotland along the way.\nFollowing the World Cup, the team underwent a period of transformation. Captain Luuk van Troost retired, as did Tim de Leede and their coach Peter Cantrell. Daan van Bunge also opted to take a break from international cricket, and the new coach opted not to retain the services of bowling coach Ian Pont.\nIn June 2007, they visited Canada, first winning an Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in King City, Ontario. They then won the first ODI by 117 runs, with the second one being abandoned. They then played a quadrangular series in Ireland, losing by ten wickets to the West Indies, and by one run to Ireland, with the game against Scotland being abandoned due to rain.\nIn August 2008, The Netherlands participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. This was their debut playing Twenty20 International matches. They finished in first place in Group B, based on their run-rate. After beating Scotland in the semi-finals, the final was abandoned due to rain and the trophy was shared between the Netherlands and Ireland.\nThe Netherlands caused a sensation in the cricketing world by beating England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 2009, whilst being 500/1 outsiders.\nThey lost their second match to the eventual winners Pakistan and did not qualify for the super 8 stage based on run rate.\n2010–present.\nOn 20 July 2010, The Netherlands beat a full-member nation for the first time in an ODI. In a one-off match shortened by rain to 30 overs a side, they beat Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The win in combination with their winning percentage against other associate and affiliate nations resulted in The Netherlands being included in ICC's official ODI-rankings.\nOn 22 February 2011, The Netherlands posted their highest ever total against a full-member nation, scoring 292 against England, batting first at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Ryan Ten Doeschate top scored 119 from 110 balls. However, the Netherlands were unable to defend their strong total and failed to pull off a huge shock, England winning by 6 wickets with 2 overs to spare. They eventually failed to win any of their group matches and were last in their Group.\nIn September 2011, Netherlands whitewashed Kenya in a short two-match ODI series held at home.\nIn the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Netherlands had one win and one loss before their final game. In order to go through on net run rate against Zimbabwe and Ireland, they needed to chase down Ireland's score in 14.2 overs or less. As Ireland scored 189, this seemed unlikely. However, strong and aggressive batting enabled them to score 193/4 in 13.5 overs, securing passage to the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 Super 10s. Although they lost their first three games in the group, including a 39/10 against Sri Lanka, they pulled off an upset against England in their last game.\nIn June 2014, Nepal along with Netherlands granted T20I status by the ICC board at the annual conference in Melbourne.\nIn their last match of the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup, The Netherlands defeated South Africa in a massive upset, knocking them out of the tournament as a result, also finishing in their best ever position (8th) to date in a T20 World Cup.\nIn the 2023 Cricket World Cup, the Netherlands defeated South Africa for a second time in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history.\nTournament history.\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within the Netherlands\"\nICC Champions Trophy.\n\"Known as the \"ICC Knockout\" in 1998 and 2000\"\nOther tournaments.\n† The final was washed out by rain, so the trophy was shared.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational match summary – Netherlands\n\"Last updated 5 March 2024.\"\nOne-Day Internationals.\nMost ODI runs for Netherlands\nMost ODI wickets for Netherlands\nODI record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to ODI #4735.

        "title": "Resistance swimming",
        "text": "Resistance swimming is a form of swimming exercise undertaken either for athletic or therapeutic purposes. In optimal circumstances, it lends itself to any stroke the swimmer wishes to perform. Resistance swimming can be carried out either against the pull of a \"tether\" or against the flow of water artificially set in motion by means of a \"swimming machine.\"\nTethered swimming.\nIn its most simple form, it consists of swimming while being held relatively stationary by a flexible restraining device, such as a harness or a foot restraint. This training method is used by a number of swim teams, such as the ones at Purdue University, University of Indianapolis, Florida State University and the University of Florida. Likewise, Special Forces Scuba Team members at Fort Bragg use a commercial restraining device in their personal training for open water swimming. Users often indicate that it takes a certain amount of time to learn to compensate for the feeling of swimming against a restraint. However, for those who have familiarized themselves with these systems, tethers enable the swimmer to swim at any speed, even flat-out sprints, and to vary the speed at will.\n\"Tethered swimming,\" as this method is known, has been in use since the middle of the twentieth century, and has undergone a gradual evolution. Initially the swimmers were restrained by a rope, which was eventually supplanted by interlocked bicycle inner tubes or surgical tubing. Presently the systems in use employ either bungee cords or coiled lines to provide the shock-absorption necessary for a comfortable swim. Attachment methods also vary. Some devices restrain the swimmer by means of a belt, others wrap around the ankles, and still others connect to specially modified water shoes.\nHybrid systems.\nThese swimming machines straddle the difference between traditional tethers and mechanical swimming machines. As a result, they combine the advantages of both, with a couple of drawbacks. They share the self-contained aspect of counter-current swimming machines with the low cost, simplicity and freedom of movement of tether systems. They are not strictly speaking \"still-water pools\" since the movements of the swimmer actually induce a gentle current of water which permits a more natural swimming experience. There are no energy costs (other than the water quality system) with these machines, as they use no electricity for swimming. While they are valuable for aerobic exercise, endurance and strength training, and for stroke practice, they cannot replicate open water conditions. Thus, for competition training they have to be complemented with open-water practice.\nSwimming machines.\nAnother form of resistance swimming is that in which the swimmer is unrestrained and the water is set in motion by means of mechanical devices, such as jets, propellers or paddle wheels. Such an apparatus is also known as a \"countercurrent swimming machine\", of which a number are presently available commercially. A prototype machine was used by the Columbia University swim team in the late 1980s.\nSwimming machines made their appearance in the 1970s, initially in the form of jetted streams. Some of these were criticized for causing turbulence and an un-natural swimming environment. They were followed by paddle-wheel and propeller-driven machines, which were popularized by Endless Pools. These generated a smoother stream of water. Many users find them easy to swim in, but the machines are also criticized for being expensive, noisy, and wasteful of energy (consuming 6.5 kW to 11 kW of electricity just to set the water in motion).\nFinally, there are exercise machines which allow a person to remain on dry land while simulating certain swimming strokes. These devices however can not compensate for the weight of the body and the limbs and thus deprive the user of the benefits of exercise in an aquatic environment."

        "title": "British Fencing",
        "text": "British Fencing (BF), formerly the British Fencing Association is the national governing body (NGB) for the Olympic sport of fencing in the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nIn 1902, the Amateur Fencing Association (AFA) was founded as the governing body for amateur fencing in the UK. The requirements for amateurism have now been dissolved, and professionalism is permitted in the UK, so in 1996 the name was changed to the British Fencing Association. (A membership body for professional fencing coaches, the British Academy of Fencing, was not founded in its current form until 1949).\nThe AFA's had combined twin roles as both Home Country Governing Body for England and national governing body. In 2002 in response to public funding frameworks, a new, separate body - England Fencing - was formed specifically to carry out the certain governing body activities for England. Over time, the boundary between the two roles has eroded.\nIn 2016 a second major sponsor was announced, and Wilkinson Sword became British Fencing's new principal sponsor.\nActivities of British Fencing.\nBF is responsible for all international fencing conducted while representing Great Britain. They control the selection criteria for all relevant competitions. They are responsible for any attendance by fencers at official FIE competitions, including the World Championships and World Cup competitions, and also at the Olympics under the IOC.\nBF is also responsible for all national domestic events. It runs the British Fencing Championships in a variety of age categories and at all three weapons of fencing (foil, épée and sabre). BF licenses member clubs and competition organisers to run fencing competitions some of which earn participants ranking points. These points are used by the BFA to create national rankings at senior, junior (U20) and cadet (U17) level.\nBF is responsible for ensuring that the sport has a robust governance structure, appropriately insured, and that those operating within the sport are appropriately qualified. It sets out the safety standards, rules and guidelines under which the sport operates, runs coaching schemes, and other activities relating to the promotion of fencing in the United Kingdom. In addition it runs a talent programme (funded by Sport England) to support young fencers (14-23) demonstrating motivation and capability to represent Great Britain. BF publishes a magazine, The Sword and collects membership fees on behalf of all the Home Country Associations - 40% of membership fees collected is passed to these associations.\nSponsorship.\nIn December 2015, a five-year sponsorship deal worth £1million with Beazley, the specialist Lloyd's insurer came to an end. During that time the investment from Beazley helped fund Great Britain teams (including Paralympic hopefuls), The National Academy, programs for increased grassroots participation to the sport, British Fencing run events, including World Cup events as well as marketing and promotion of the sport.\nBF is currently sponsored by Wilkinson Sword.\nWorld Class Performance Programme.\nUntil March 2017 BF operated a World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) which was a programme, funded by UK Sport, which helped British Fencing to fund those athletes who are likely to achieve podium success at the Olympic Games.\nUnder this programme, the Men's Foil Team qualified for Rio 2016 which was the first time that a Fencing team had qualified under the system introduced by the FIE 20 years ago. The team achieved sixth - narrowly losing to Russia, the eventual winners - and Richard Kruse came fourth in the individual event - the best Olympic results in decades.\nIn December 2016, UK Sport announced that they had withdrawn funding from fencing. In the funding review, Fencing was banded by UK Sport as Band 4. This means that Fencing was considered a 'possible' not 'probable' medal winning sport for Tokyo 2020. Along with all the other sports in Band 4, Fencing lost its WCP funding.\nRankings.\nFencers are ranked by category (Cadet, Junior and Senior), weapon (foil, épée or sabre) and gender. Rankings are calculated from ranking points earned in competitions attended by the fencers. The number of points earned depends on the strength of the competition as well as how well the fencer did.\nGovernance.\nThe Board of British Fencing (BF) is responsible for the overall governance, development and management of the sport of fencing in GB. The Board sets the strategic direction of the sport, appoints the CEO and monitors progress and results.\nThe board consists of twelve board directors, of whom eight are elected and four appointed by the board (these four being the chair of the board and of British Fencing, an additional director and two independent directors). The board's quorum rules specify that the elected members must always be in the majority. In addition to these voting directors, board meetings are attended by the BF president and home country and athlete representatives. Staff members attend some meetings, or parts of meetings, to brief/advise the Board.\nSubdivisions.\nUnder its auspices the six Home Nations (Wales, England, Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey and Scotland) have their own governing bodies. The country is further subdivided into 'regions'.\nAdministration.\nThe British Fencing office is based at 1 Baron's Gate, 33-35 Rothschild Road, London W4 5HT. Its current Chief Executive is Georgina Usher."

        "title": "Tim Thomas (ice hockey, born 1974)",
        "text": "Timothy Thomas Jr. (born April 15, 1974) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who mainly played in the National Hockey League (NHL), most notably with the Boston Bruins.\nHe was born in Flint, Michigan and is a graduate of Davison High School. Thomas played college hockey for the University of Vermont for four years, from 1993–1997, during which he was drafted 217th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He played for several years in the minor leagues and Europe, before making it to the NHL at age 28, with the Boston Bruins. He finally emerged as the Bruins' starting goaltender at age 32. Thomas is a two-time winner of the Vezina Trophy (2009 and 2011) as the NHL's best goaltender, and was a member of Team USA in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Thomas won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was the oldest player in NHL history to win the award at age 37. Thomas is one of four American-born players to win the Conn Smythe Trophy, along with Brian Leetch, Jonathan Quick, and Patrick Kane.\nPlaying career.\nCollege hockey.\nThomas played four seasons (1993–97) of college hockey for the University of Vermont, posting an 81–43–15 record to go with a 2.70 GAA and .934 save percentage. He ranks third in the NCAA Division I record book in career saves (3,950). He led the nation in save percentage in 1996 (.924) and helped UVM's Catamounts to NCAA tournament appearances in his final two seasons, including a berth in the 1996 NCAA Frozen Four (a program first). He was a two-time All-ECAC Conference selection and a two-time NCAA East All-American. He ranks first all-time amongst Vermont goalies in games played (140), wins (81) and saves (3,950). At Vermont, Thomas played on the same team as former NHL All-Star Martin St. Louis.\nEarly pro years.\nCompleting his four-year tenure at Vermont, Thomas played briefly for the Birmingham Bulls of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) and Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League (IHL) in 1997–98, before transferring overseas mid-season to HIFK of the Finnish SM-Liiga. Thomas played 18 games with a save percentage of .947 as the team advanced through the playoffs to defeat Ilves in the finals and win the Finnish championship. After signing with the Edmonton Oilers on June 4, 1998, Thomas initially moved to the American Hockey League (AHL) the following season with the Hamilton Bulldogs, where he played 15 games, before again transferring to HIFK. Thomas recorded a .917 save percentage in 14 games as HIFK made it to the league finals once more but finished as runners-up to TPS.\nIn 1999–2000, Thomas returned once again to North America to play for the Detroit Vipers of the IHL, then spent the next season with AIK IF of the Swedish Elitserien. In 2001, he joined the Boston Bruins organization, but chose to continue playing in Europe, spending his first full SM-liiga season in 2001–02 with Kärpät. Although the team did not get far in the playoffs, Thomas played a successful season of 32 games with a .925 save percentage.\nAHL seasons, NHL debut.\nBeginning in 2002–03, Thomas played his initial two seasons with Boston's AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Bruins during the 2002–03 season, appearing in four games total, with a .907 save percentage and a 3–1 record. Thomas recorded his first NHL win in his league debut with the Bruins on October 19, 2002, in a 31-save, 4–3 win against the Edmonton Oilers.\nReturn to Finland.\nAs a result of the one-season duration NHL lockout in North America, in 2004–05 Thomas joined Jokerit of the SM-Liiga, his fourth stint in Finland. He played in all games of the season except one, 54 games in total, and posted a league-high .946 save percentage. He also surpassed the previous record of 13 shutouts in the league by achieving 15 shutouts during the regular season. Thomas continued to perform in the playoffs, where he played 12 games with a .938 save percentage. However, the team was unable to defeat Kärpät in the finals, and Thomas was awarded his second silver medal in the SM-liiga. He received the Lasse Oksanen trophy (as the league's best player) and the Kultainen kypärä award (as the league's best player award as voted by the players), becoming the first Jokerit player to win the award since Teemu Selänne.\nBoston Bruins.\n2005–2006.\nIn August 2005, Thomas signed to play with Jokerit for the 2005–06 season, but his contract included an NHL option and on September 14, one day before the regular season in the SM-liiga started, Thomas announced he had signed with the Boston Bruins, leaving Jokerit with rookie goaltender Joonas Hallikainen as their sole goaltender. Eventually, Jokerit used three North American goaltenders (Karl Goehring, Steve Passmore and Tom Askey) that season, but missed the playoffs.\nWhen he returned to North America, Thomas was assigned to the Providence Bruins of the AHL out of training camp. However, as Boston suffered injuries to their two goaltenders Andrew Raycroft and Hannu Toivonen, Thomas earned his first call-up to the NHL in three years and took over as the Bruins starter, completing the 2005–06 season with a 12–13–7 record, 2.77 goals against average (GAA), .917 save percentage and his first NHL shutout. As a result, Thomas was awarded the Boston Bruins 7th Player Award, voted by the fans as having gone beyond expectations. In the off-season, Thomas was re-signed by the Bruins to a three-year contract.\n2006–2009.\nAlthough Boston's previous starter, Andrew Raycroft, was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the off-season, Thomas began the 2006–07 season as the Bruins' backup, behind Hannu Toivonen instead. However, as Toivonen struggled, Thomas was again promoted as the Bruins' starting goaltender, eventually posting a 30–29–4 record with a .904 save percentage. He won the 7th Player Award for the second consecutive season and became the first goaltender in team history to win the award twice.\nDuring the summer of 2007, Thomas began a yoga-based physical conditioning program to increase his flexibility and strength, and one that would greatly increase his abilities during the 2007–08 season and onwards.\nOn July 1, 2007, the Bruins acquired goaltender Manny Fernandez from the Minnesota Wild and later traded Thomas' previous backup, Toivonen, to the St. Louis Blues. Many hockey analysts presumed Thomas would support Fernandez as a backup goaltender once again for the 2007–08 season. However, as Fernandez went down to injury early in the season, Thomas seized the opportunity and once again emerged as the Bruins' starter. He was selected for his first NHL All-Star Game on January 22, 2008, as a replacement for Martin Brodeur and played in the third period of the game, stopping 14 of 18 shots. Thomas was credited with the win, as the Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference 8–7.\nEarly in the 2008–09 season, Thomas became the first Bruins goaltender to record back-to-back shutouts since Byron Dafoe in 1999, winning 1–0 games against the Edmonton Oilers on October 27, 2008, and the Vancouver Canucks on October 28. His overall shutout streak came to end the next game at 154:43 minutes against the Calgary Flames on October 30. In late November, Thomas missed a few games due to an illness. He was chosen to play in his second All-Star Game in 2009 and was once again the winning goaltender for the Eastern Conference, defeating the Western Conference 12–11 in a shootout (the first time the All-Star Game required the tie-breaker since 2003). One month later, on February 26, 2009, Thomas recorded his 100th NHL win in a 6–0 shutout against the Anaheim Ducks.\n2009–2010.\nOn April 2, 2009 Thomas agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Bruins, through the 2012–13 season. The contract saw him make $6 million the first two seasons, then $5 million and $3 million the final two seasons for an average annual salary of $5 million. Two days later, on April 4, he posted his career-high fifth shutout of the season in a 1–0 win against the New York Rangers, clinching the top spot in the Eastern Conference, Boston's first title since 2001–02. His strong play allowed the Bruins to sweep the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the 2009 playoffs, however the Bruins were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games in the second round.\nOn June 18, 2009, Thomas was awarded the Vezina Trophy, edging Minnesota Wild netminder Niklas Bäckström and the Columbus Blue Jackets' rookie goaltender Steve Mason. He led the NHL with his 2.10 GAA and .933 save percentage.\nThomas started for the Bruins in the 3rd NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2010. The game, held at Fenway Park in Boston, resulted in a 2–1 overtime victory over the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. But Thomas suffered a drop-off in form during the regular season, posting just a 17–18–8 record, albeit with a still-strong 2.56 GAA. He did not play at all in the playoffs, as Tuukka Rask played all the games for Boston. The Bruins won their First Round series and led the Philadelphia Flyers three games to none in the Conference semi-final. Boston then lost the next four games to drop the series; the Flyers became just the third out of four teams in NHL history (after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders, and before the 2014 Los Angeles Kings) to win a series after losing the first three games.\nNamed to his third straight NHL All-Star Game in 2011 – the game was not played in 2010 due to the Winter Olympics – Thomas became the first goaltender in NHL history to earn the win in three consecutive All-Star Games.\n2010–2011 and Stanley Cup win.\nIn the 2010–11 season, following off-season hip surgery during the summer of 2010, Thomas broke the NHL record for save percentage, beating Dominik Hašek's record of .937, with a .938 percentage. Thomas would go on to win his second Vezina trophy that year.\nOn May 27, 2011, Thomas posted a shutout victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, sending the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup appearance since 1990. In the Final, Thomas again posted a shutout victory in Game 7 against the Vancouver Canucks. During the Bruins' playoff run, he set the record for most saves in a single post-season with 798 and the most saves in a Stanley Cup series with 238, and broke Frank McCool's 66-year-old record of fewest goals allowed in a seven-game Stanley Cup Finals, allowing only eight goals total (for an all-time record .967 save percentage in the Stanley Cup Finals). Thomas also became the first goaltender ever to post a shutout in a Game 7 on the road. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, and at 37 years, 62 days, Thomas is the oldest recipient of the award. He became just the second American-born NHL player (after Brian Leetch in 1994) and first American-born goaltender to win the award.\n2011–2012 and subsequent break from hockey.\nThomas began the 2011–12 season as a Stanley Cup champion and the defending Vezina and Conn Smythe trophy winner. He played the majority of the 82-game schedule for the Bruins, beating Tuukka Rask for the number one spot for the second consecutive year. Although not completely matching the previous year's record-breaking run, Thomas received the most votes in the 2012 All Star Game Ballot, entering the 2012 NHL All-Star Game as the starting goaltender, and put up another solid year with the Bruins, helping them dominate the NHL with their goal differential for the majority of the year.\nThe Bruins ended up losing in seven games to the Washington Capitals in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Every game of the series was won by only one goal. Shortly after the Bruins' season ended, Thomas announced that he would sit out the 2012–13 season. Bruins' general manager Peter Chiarelli confirmed Thomas' decision.\nThomas was traded to the New York Islanders on February 7, 2013, in exchange for a conditional second-round draft pick in either 2014 or 2015. Before the trade, the Bruins had suspended Thomas for not reporting to training camp. Thomas did not play any games with the Islanders organization before his contract expired.\nThomas' 196 regular-season wins with Boston ranks him fifth on the team's all-time list as of 2023.\nFlorida Panthers and Dallas Stars.\n2013–2014.\nAfter taking a year off from the NHL, Thomas joined the Florida Panthers on a tryout contract on September 16, 2013. He officially signed a one-year contract with the Panthers on September 26. Thomas has mentioned he chose 34 as his jersey number with the Panthers in honor of John Vanbiesbrouck, a goaltender from Michigan whom he grew up watching.\nThomas was acquired by the Dallas Stars on March 5, 2014, in exchange for goaltender Dan Ellis. He went back to number 30 in Dallas and served as backup to Kari Lehtonen.\nInternational play.\nDuring Thomas' college career with the University of Vermont, he was twice named to the United States squad for the World Championships. Following his sophomore year, he was chosen for the 1995 World Championships, but did not appear in any games as the United States finished in sixth place. He was chosen for the tournament for the second consecutive year in 1996 and made his international debut, playing in 21 minutes for one game, allowing one goal. Thomas picked up his first medal as the United States won bronze. \nAfter graduating from the college program, Thomas was named to Team USA for the 1998 World Championships following his rookie professional season and played his first full international game. However, the United States finished a disappointing 12th. Thomas would not make another World Championships appearance until 2005, where he was named to Team USA in another limited role, not appearing in any games behind starter Rick DiPietro as they failed to earn a medal. \nEstablished as an NHL starter following the 2007–08 season, Thomas was named to his fifth World Championships in 2008. He appeared in three games before suffering a groin injury, splitting starts with Robert Esche and posting a 1.50 GAA with one shutout against Latvia in the preliminaries. The United States finished in sixth place. \nOn January 1, 2010, Thomas was selected to be a member of the United States men's hockey team for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, serving as backup goaltender to the Buffalo Sabres' Ryan Miller. \nOn February 26, 2010, Thomas made his Olympic debut in the United States–Finland semi-final, entering the game with approximately 11:30 remaining in the third period and a 6–0 lead. He replaced Ryan Miller to prevent any chance of injury to the American starter. \nPersonal life.\nThomas and wife Melissa have three children: two daughters and a son. Thomas is a Christian and a Libertarian, and has stated that the person he would most like to have dinner with is conservative TV pundit Glenn Beck. After winning the Stanley Cup in 2011, Thomas skipped the traditional victors' meet-and-greet with President Barack Obama at the White House on January 23, 2012; he was the only active Bruin not to attend. He released a statement regarding his absence:\nAfter retiring from hockey, Thomas resided in Sandpoint, Idaho, and also Milton, Vermont.\nAwards and honors.\nOther\nHockey camps.\nThomas runs several ice hockey camps in the Northeast United States during the NHL off-season for both goaltenders and skaters."

        "text": "Meet the Masters is a classical music television program aired in 1952 on NBC. The series debuted on February 24, 1952. The first episode featured violinist Jascha Heifetz. The series went on hiatus after the April 20, 1952, episode, and returned on October 19, 1952. Each episode was developed around \"a simple story line woven into the half-hour to give it production appeal along with a pleasing touch of informality.\"\nJack Gould, columnist for \"The New York Times\", reviewed the initial broadcast with mixed feelings. He complimented Heifetz's playing \"with all his accustomed brilliance\" but felt that the program devoted too much time to Heifetz's answering \"a series of questions leading to the standard bromidic gags\" from a group of students.\nIn addition to Heifetz, performers featured on the program in the spring of 1952 included Marian Anderson (March 9), Arthur Rubinstein (March 23), The Trio (April 6), and Andres Segovia, Jan Peerce, and Nadine Conner (April 20). The fall of 1952 had repeats of spring episodes plus a show that featured Gregor Piatigorsky (November 16).\nThe program was sponsored by James Lee &amp; Sons Co., which manufactured carpets, rungs and knitting yarn. \nIn 1953, episodes were distributed by Standard TV via syndication under the title \"Music by the Masters\"."

        "text": "Major League Baseball is a professional baseball league in Canada and the United States, and is widely regarded as the best league for the sport in the world. In addition, MLB is the best baseball league in the world in terms of revenue, and 85 countries are active in international competition per WBSC. Unlike FIFA, players do not register with a country, so nationality is often disputed when international fixtures come around, such as Manny Machado representing the Dominican Republic instead of the United States in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Similarly, Alex Rodriguez played for the United States in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, but before the 2009 World Baseball Classic he announced his intention to play for the Dominican Republic (though ultimately he didn't play in the 2009 tournament due to injury). And in another example, Marcus Stroman played for the United States in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but played for Puerto Rico in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. As such, player representation by birth spans to 25 countries as of the 2022 MLB season, with the United States topping the list at 1,057 players called up to 26-man rosters. The most represented overseas country is the Dominican Republic, with 171 players called up to 26-man rosters. The ranking for countries for most MLB players by birth matches well with the WBSC World Rankings, although East Asia and Australia underperforms in MLB and European nations have little to no representation, likely due to acquisition fees, travel to home soil, and/or professional baseball leagues in their home country with good revenue.\nAsia.\nSouth Korea.\nLee Jung hoo"

        "title": "British Darts Organisation",
        "text": "The British Darts Organisation (BDO) was a darts organisation founded on 7 January 1973 by Olly Croft. Made up of 66 member counties, it oversaw professional, semi-professional and amateur darts competitions in Britain. The BDO was a founder member of the World Darts Federation in 1974. It also staged a World Professional Darts Championship from 1978 to 2020.\nIn the early 1990s, a dispute between Olly Croft and the top darts players over the decline in TV coverage and sponsorship led to an acrimonious split in the game, with the players breaking away to form their own governing body which became the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Henceforth, the BDO and PDC ran their own separate tours, each with its own world championship.\nThe BDO suffered an increasing number of problems in its later years. Many of its top players defected to the more lucrative PDC. Irregularities at the 2019 World Masters led to the BDO being demoted to associate member status by the World Darts Federation. Financial issues led to prize money for the 2020 World Championship being greatly reduced. The BDO subsequently went into liquidation in September 2020.\nHistory.\nThe BDO was founded on 7 January 1973 by Olly Croft. It gradually superseded the existing National Darts Association of Great Britain (NDAGB), which had been the de facto governing body of darts in the UK since 1954. The BDO set the rules which govern the game of darts, including setting the distance of the throwing oche (2.37m / 7 ft 9 ¼ inches) and the height and dimensions of the board. The BDO organised the first World Professional Darts Championship in 1978, known for 26 years as The Embassy due to its sponsorship by Imperial Tobacco until 2003. It was then known from 2004 to 2019 as the Lakeside World Professional Darts Championship, or Lakeside for short. In 2019, before the tournament moved to the O2 Arena in 2020, the tournament was derecognised by the World Darts Federation.\nSplit in darts.\nAfter the World Championship began, televised darts became more prevalent with many major tournaments appearing on ITV and BBC. But by 1988, darts had lost many of its sponsors and only the World Championship remained on television. Some players became frustrated by the lack of opportunity to make a living professionally.\nA group of 19 players (including all previous world champions who were still active in the game) created the World Darts Council (WDC), later the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) towards the end of 1990. They wanted more tournaments to be staged and to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game.\nThe 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last unified world darts championship. On 7 January 1993, the rebel players issued a joint statement affirming that they would only compete in the 1994 tournament if it was held under the auspices of the WDC. The BDO responded by banning the rebel players from all BDO tournaments. After a long legal battle, the BDO was forced to acknowledge the WDC's legitimacy and the right of players to choose which body they competed for. In return the WDC dropped its claim to being the sport's governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation.\nAfter the split.\nFollowing the split, the BDO and PDC ran their own tours, including their own versions of the world championship, with separate pools of players. Since there were two World Championships from 1994 onwards, there were calls for head-to-head matches between the two champions. There were two head-to-head matches between the reigning champions of the two organisations. The challenge matches, held in 1999 and 2004, were officially recognised as undisputed championship matches. In their respective matches, the incumbent BDO champions Raymond van Barneveld and Andy Fordham were defeated by the PDC champion Phil Taylor.\nThe BDO board continued to support players from the grassroots of the game since the \"split\", although there were several high-profile players who made a name within the organisation only to later join the PDC. Raymond van Barneveld's career in the BDO helped boost the popularity of the sport in his home country, the Netherlands. Dutch broadcaster SBS6 has broadcast the World Championship since 1998, and used to show two major BDO tournaments, the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy. Both no longer exist. However, the popularity of the sport has possibly contributed to the Netherlands making more star players, including the 2006 BDO World Champion, Jelle Klaasen, and the 2006 World Masters Champion, Michael van Gerwen.\nExodus of players.\nThe rival PDC ran many more televised tournaments and offered greater prize money, allowing top players to make a full-time living from darts. Consequently, a large number of players who originally played in the BDO \"defected\" to the PDC. In 2015, one commentator described the BDO as \"mostly an unwilling feeder to the PDC: most of its biggest stars... jump ship given the chance.\"\nIn 2001, six prominent BDO players, including 1996 champion Steve Beaton and two-time runner-up Ronnie Baxter, announced that they would be competing in the PDC version of the world championship in 2002. Croft insisted the six players would not be missed and suggested that none would have progressed beyond the first round of the tournament. The executive producer of BBC Darts disagreed, stating \"You can't just replace recognisable people with unknowns and say it is the same and that nothing has changed.\" In 2006, in what was described as a “massive coup” for the PDC, four-time BDO champion Raymond van Barneveld moved to the PDC. Van Barneveld said he was switching for the challenge and to \"compete against the best players in the world, including the best, Phil Taylor.\" In January 2007, Dutch trio Jelle Klaasen, Michael van Gerwen and Vincent van der Voort moved to the PDC. They were followed a month later by Mervyn King.\nBDO number 1 Robert Thornton decided to move to the PDC in May 2008. Gary Anderson and Mark Webster were the BDO's two top ranked players when they signed with the PDC in January 2009. 2008 Lakeside runner-up Simon Whitlock also signed with the PDC in 2009. Weeks after winning the Lakeside title in January 2014, Stephen Bunting became the first reigning BDO champion to join the PDC. Three-time defending champion Glen Durrant followed suit in 2019 after winning a PDC tour card at Q School, declaring it \"as good as winning the championship at Lakeside.\" John Part (1997), Richie Burnett (2000), Ted Hankey (2012), Les Wallace (2013), Christian Kist (2014), and Scott Waites (2020) are the other past BDO champions who subsequently switched to the PDC.\nBy contrast, very few players moved from the PDC to the BDO. 2004 Lakeside champion Andy Fordham moved to the PDC in 2009 and returned to the BDO in 2013. Three time BDO women's champion Anastasia Dobromyslova switched to the PDC in 2008, before returning in 2011. Ted Hankey, after switching to the PDC in 2012, returned to the BDO in 2014. Andy Hamilton and Wes Newton began playing in BDO events at the start of 2018 after losing their PDC tour cards and both qualified for the 2019 BDO world championship.\n2011 Annual General Meeting.\nPrior to the 2011 Annual General Meeting of the BDO, many players and officials within the organisation had expressed increasing degrees of dissatisfaction with the performance of the existing Board of Directors. Particular areas of concern were the BDO's apparent stagnation in terms of creating new televised events and gaining new sponsors. An open letter was circulated to the various counties within the BDO structure, setting out the perceived issues, although the said letter was vague as to actual suggestions for improvement. Matters culminated at the subsequent AGM, where all but one of the incumbent Board were voted out of office (other than Dave Alderman who had already resigned), with only Vic Sexton retaining his seat.\nLater issues, WDF demotion and liquidation.\nIn 2016 the BDO was dealt a blow when the BBC opted not to renew their contract to cover the annual BDO world championships, bringing to an end the 38 year relationship between the BBC and the Lakeside tournament. The BBC instead decided to focus their darts coverage on a new PDC tournament, the Champions League of Darts. The 2017 and 2018 BDO tournaments were broadcast jointly by Channel 4 and BT Sport. From 2019, the tournament was no longer covered by one of the former analogue channels and was shown free-to-air on Quest and on sister pay channel Eurosport.\nThe 2019 World Masters was beset with problems. Several seeded players opted not to participate in the event in protest at a change to qualifying criteria. Other players who did attend found they were unregistered, having been unaware of a new rule which required them to register in advance online. Due to the confusion, officials announced that there would be a redraw, which included fake names, apparently so they could be substituted if more real players arrived. Players were also not informed of the event's prize money in advance.\nDue to the issues at the World Masters, the World Darts Federation subsequently released a statement announcing that the BDO was to be demoted to \"associate member\" status and the WDF would no longer recognise BDO-organised tournaments. They cited the recent \"breach of rules\" and \"draw changes during their competition\", adding \"we cannot be a part of or support such activities.\"\nOn 30 December 2019, five days before the start of the 2020 BDO World Championship, BDO chairman Des Jacklin announced that the prize money for the upcoming event would have to be \"reduced somewhat\", although the BDO did not confirm what the new prize fund would be. Jacklin cited the failure to secure a sponsor for the event, and the fact that only 15% of tickets had been sold. The reduction in the prize fund and the failure to confirm the reduced amounts that players would receive was criticised by a number of players. In protest at the reduced prize money on offer, Fallon Sherrock, runner-up in the 2015 women's event, confirmed that she would be withdrawing from the competition. Ultimately, champion Wayne Warren received £23,000, a 77% reduction on the previous year's prize money and the lowest amount received by a winner of the tournament since 1989. In September 2020, the company went into liquidation bringing an end to 47 years of history.\nIn March 2023 The 38 trophies and plaques belonging to the now defunct British Darts Organisation were put up for auction in order to pay off creditors that were affected by the liquidation of the British Darts Organisation in 2020.\nMajor tournaments.\nBDO Events Ltd was the commercial arm of the BDO (British Darts Organisation) and was set up in 2013. The annual BDO Major events comprised the following British televised events:\nWorld Professional Championship.\nThe World Championship was the biggest of the tournaments, held at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, UK from 1985 until 2019, for its 43rd and final year it moved to Indigo at The O2. The tournament started in 1978 and for the first 15 years it was a unified World Championship, before a separate competition (the PDC World Championship) began in 1994. There have been 24 different winners of the event and Eric Bristow is the player with the most BDO World titles including a hat-trick between 1984 and 1986.\nIn December 2019 the World Darts Federation announced that it would no longer recognise the BDO as the ruling body of darts in the UK, no longer recognised the BDO World Championships and thus it no longer became a recognised world championship. In January 2020, the WDF assumed full responsibility for the running of the event and will be launching the tournament under the WDF banner.\nWorld Masters.\nThe World Masters was the longest running BDO major title, having started as far back as 1974. It was the second biggest major title on the BDO stage. Having been first staged in Fulham, the tournament has been to Wembley, Earls Court, Kensington, the Lakeside Country Club and others. Its last venue was the Circus Tavern in Purfleet.\nThe tournament featured shorter sets than the World Championship – each set is the best of three legs instead of five at Lakeside. In the 40-year history of the event, only 7 players have managed to win the title on more than one occasion. Eric Bristow holds the record for most tournament wins with five. Bob Anderson and Martin Adams hold the record of winning the title three years running 86, 87, 88 for Anderson and 08, 09, 10 for Adams. Only 14 players have won both the Masters and World titles in their career. In January 2020, the WDF assumed full responsibility for the running of the event and will be launching the tournament under the WDF banner.\nThe BDO World Trophy.\nThe BDO World Trophy was the newest \"Major\" Darts tournament added to the BDO's events calendar from 2014 onwards, organised by BDO Events – the new commercial arm of the British Darts Organisation. BDO Events was part of the first liquidation when they wound up their commercial business, not long after that the BDO itself also filed for liquidation bringing an end to 47 years as the governing body for darts in the UK.\nFormer televised tournaments.\nTopic International Darts League.\nThe Topic International Darts League was a tournament staged in the Netherlands and formed the second leg of the Grand Slam having been introduced in 2003. Whilst its format has evolved in recent years, it features players competing in a round-robin tournament. The 2006 event featured 32 players in 8 groups of 4, which were then reduced to 4 further groups of 4. The top two in each group then went through to the knockout stages.\nWhen Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC in 2006, the tournament organisers agreed with the BDO to invite four players from the rival organisation. Van Barneveld (PDC) went on to win the title for the third time in 2006 and Gary Anderson (BDO) won the 2007 event. This remains the only major event to date that Phil Taylor hasn't won in either the BDO or PDC.\nBullit World Darts Trophy.\nThe World Darts Trophy (WDT) was the third BDO major of the year and the second to be held in the Netherlands. Its straight knock-out format is comparable to the two versions of the World Championship.\nThe WDT followed the International Darts League by inviting four PDC players to the tournament in 2006, and again a PDC player (Phil Taylor) won the title.\nBritish Gold Cup.\nThe British Gold Cup began in 1978 and was held in Stoke. It was broadcast on the BBC until 1982, with the 1983 tournament blacked out due to a technicians' strike. It was then broadcast in 2008 on Setanta Sports in the UK, after a brief stint on the short-lived channel Wire TV (1994–95).\nDiscontinued tournaments.\nBritish Professional Championship.\nThe Unipart British Professional Championship was a tournament televised by the BBC between 1981 and 1988. After the 1988 championships, the BBC withdrew their coverage of the event and it left UK terrestrial television with only one televised tournament – the World Championships. The game was at an all-time low and players eventually went on to set up the World Darts Council in an attempt to bring back sponsors and television.\nJocky Wilson won the title a record four times – John Lowe also reached four finals but lost them all.\nBritish Matchplay.\nBritish Matchplay ran from 1976 to 1983 with a brief revival in 1986. The tournament was broadcast on the ITV network in 1978, but usually broadcast regionally including Anglia Television in 1977 and Central in 1986.\nBullseye Darts Championship.\nNot to be confused with the long-running game show \"Bullseye\", this was a BBC2 tournament which ran for three years during the peak of darts' boom period at the turn of the eighties. Jocky Wilson was twice the winner.\nButlins Grand Masters.\nATV broadcast the Butlins Grand Masters between 1977 and 1988. Matches were played over the best of nine legs. The tournament was held at a pub in Birmingham. Bobby George was twice the winner and Eric Bristow won a hat-trick of titles.\nWorld Matchplay.\nThe MFI World Matchplay championship was short-lived but historic in darts as it featured the first ever televised nine-dart finish on 13 October 1984 when John Lowe won £102,000 for the perfect game of darts against Keith Deller. Lowe went on to win the title that year. The tournament was broadcast on ITV and originally came from the Fulcrum Centre, Slough before switching to Festival Hall, Basildon. ITV ceased coverage after the 1988 championships and the tournament ended. ITV also pulled coverage of the World Masters after the 1988 event, leaving the BBC as the only broadcaster of darts until 1992.\nThe PDC introduced a new version of World Matchplay in 1994."

It was the eleventh race of the 2005 Formula One season and the last race for then Minardi driver Patrick Friesacher.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2004 Constructors' Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\nReport.\nQualifying.\nFor the second consecutive race, Renault's Fernando Alonso took pole position while his championship rival, McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen, was demoted ten places on the grid following an engine failure. Räikkönen, who had originally qualified second with a time just 0.027 seconds slower than Alonso's, suffered this engine failure during Saturday free practice. This promoted BAR's Jenson Button, in his home race, to the front row, with the top ten being completed by Juan Pablo Montoya in the second McLaren, Jarno Trulli in the Toyota, Rubens Barrichello in the Ferrari, Giancarlo Fisichella in the second Renault, Takuma Sato in the second BAR, Ralf Schumacher in the second Toyota, Michael Schumacher in the second Ferrari, and Jacques Villeneuve in the Sauber. Jordan's Tiago Monteiro started at the rear of the grid after failing to set a time, following an engine failure during Friday practice.\nRace.\nBefore the race, a minute of silence was held as a mark of respect for those who had lost their lives in the London bombings three days earlier. Daily Express reporter Bob McKenzie honored the pledge to run naked around the Silverstone track if McLaren won the race in 2004. McLaren boss Ron Dennis sent McKenzie on his way two hours before the start of the race. He arrived at the finish line 36 minutes later after honouring his promise wearing nothing more than silver body paint and a sporran. McKenzie's run raised money for charity.\nThe weather was hot, with air temperature at 30 °C, and the track temperature at 45 °C as the cars completed the formation lap. Sato stalled as he came to the grid, after he had mistakenly pressed the kill switch on his steering wheel, but race director Charlie Whiting nonetheless started the race, with the safety car being deployed on lap 2 to allow the marshals to safely return the BAR to the pit lane. Sato would eventually rejoin the race, two laps behind the leaders. Montoya made a fast start, passing Button off the grid and then overtaking Alonso for the lead into Becketts. After the safety car period, Montoya retained the lead until the first round of pit stops, although Alonso remained no more than a second and a half behind as he and the Colombian traded fastest laps. Button held third, while Barrichello and Fisichella passed a slow-starting Trulli, who in turn was holding up Michael Schumacher. Räikkönen, already up four places, was thus able to close up behind Schumacher and Trulli, but was unable to overtake them until the pit stops.\nMontoya made his first pit stop on lap 21, a lap earlier than planned due to traffic. Alonso followed on lap 23, rejoining the race almost side-by-side with Montoya, who again held his line. Fisichella led for the next two laps, setting the fastest lap in the process, before making his first stop. On lap 28, with every driver except Sato having pitted, Montoya led Alonso by three seconds, followed by Fisichella, Button, Barrichello, Räikkönen, Michael Schumacher and Trulli.\nOn lap 32 Barrichello, on a three-stop strategy, made his second stop. This enabled Räikkönen, now the fastest man on the track, to close up behind Button. Montoya responded to his team-mate's pace, and to Alonso, by setting back-to-back fastest laps on laps 40 and 41, increasing his lead over the Spaniard to over six seconds. On lap 43, Räikkönen took fourth when Button made his second stop, easily retaining this position after his own stop two laps later. Montoya pitted on lap 44, putting Alonso back in front, before Barrichello made his third stop on lap 45. On lap 46 Fisichella, on course for his first podium since winning the opening race of the season in Australia, made his second stop, but stalled as he tried to leave the pits, promoting Räikkönen to third.\nAlonso led for five laps before pitting on lap 49, but lost time trying to lap Trulli. This meant that he did not have a big enough lead to make his stop and rejoin the race in front of Montoya, though he was comfortably ahead of Räikkönen. In the end, the Colombian took his first win for McLaren by 2.7 seconds. \nRäikkönen set the fastest race lap on the final lap to finish less than 12 seconds behind Alonso, while Fisichella ended up 3.5 seconds behind the Finn. Button finished a distant fifth, ahead of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, while Ralf Schumacher edged out Toyota team-mate Trulli for the final point.\nThere was only one retirement in the race, Jordan's Narain Karthikeyan dropping out on lap 11 with an electrical failure.\nThe result allowed Alonso to increase his lead over Räikkönen in the Drivers' Championship by two points, 77 to 51. Michael Schumacher remained in third on 43 points, while Montoya moved up to sixth with 26. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren reduced the deficit to Renault by three points, 102 to 87, Ferrari remaining in third on 74."

        "title": "Poppy Hills Golf Course",
        "text": " \nPoppy Hills Golf Course is the newest golf course in Pebble Beach, California, after undergoing an extensive 13-month renovation that was completed in April 2014. The original Poppy Hills was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., and opened in 1986. Along with Pebble Beach Golf Links and Spyglass Hill Golf Course, Poppy Hills co-hosted the PGA Tour's AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am from 1991 to 2009, replacing Cypress Point in the rotation. Poppy Hills co-hosted the Champions Tour's Nature Valley First Tee Open with Pebble Beach for three years, beginning in September 2014.\nPoppy Hills was the first course in the United States to be owned and operated by an amateur golf association, the Northern California Golf Association. Poppy Hills is the headquarters and tournament home of the NCGA, which also owns Poppy Ridge Golf Course in Livermore. Poppy Hills was featured in the original \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" video game series in 1999, and was an active course through 2004.\nCourse.\nPoppy Hills is the only course of the seven in Pebble Beach that plays exclusively in the forest. It is also unique because it features bentgrass greens and no rough, both of which are rare on the Monterey Peninsula. The renovation by RTJ II Golf Course Architects reduced the par from 72 to 71, but the yardage increased from 6,863 to 7,002. The entire course was topped with a 5-inch layer of sand, a process called sand capping, which dramatically improves the drainage, fostering firm and fast conditions year-round. All 18 greens were redesigned, reducing the strong undulations that previously existed. While the greens are roughly the same size as before, they are now easier to hit with a low-running shot because of the firmer conditions and elimination of rough. The renovation also softened the sharp doglegs and heavy mounding that previously existed. Naturalized waste areas and pine straw were added throughout the course, bringing the forest more into play while also reducing irrigated turf from 82 acres to 62, which has greatly improved water conservation efforts.\nThe 12th hole was converted from a sharp dogleg-right par 5 to a straightaway par 4 that features an elevated tee and a view of the Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains, changing the par on the back nine from 36 to 35, and the overall par from 72 to 71. The 11th hole is the only brand new hole on the course, as it went from the longest par 3 on the property to the shortest, and plays in the opposite direction. Every hole was changed, but all the others stayed within their same routing.\nPoppy Hills also completely renovated its practice facility and clubhouse. The restaurant, Porter's at Poppy Hills, was also reinvented, and is now run by executive chef Johnny De Vivo, formerly of Casanova and La Bicyclette in Carmel. The practice facility is headed by Jeff Ritter, a \"Golf Digest\" Best Young Teacher.\nAT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.\nPoppy Hills replaced Cypress Point Club as one of the host courses of the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1991. The switch occurred after the private club did not immediately admit an African-American member, despite the request of the Tour. Poppy Hills last hosted the AT&amp;T National Pro-Am in 2009. The AT&amp;T moved to Monterey Peninsula Country Club's Shore Course in 2010. Matt Gogel set the Poppy Hills course record with a 10-under 62 during the 2001 AT&amp;T.\nReception.\nThe new Poppy Hills has been widely heralded since it reopened in 2014. Golf.com Travel Writer Joe Passov said the new Poppy Hills has a \"Pinehurst-like touch, with just a hint of near-neighbor Cypress Point.\" Golf Getaways Travel Writer Vic Williams added about the new design, \"at certain times it feels like Pinehurst, other times like Augusta, with dashes of Pine Valley.\""

        "text": "Alan Ronald Mills (6 November 1935 – 18 January 2024) was an English tennis player and tournament referee for the Wimbledon tennis championships from 1983 to 2005. Although each individual tennis match was controlled by an on-court umpire, Alan Mills ran the entire tournament. However, perhaps he was most well known because the decision to stop play in the event of rain was that of Mills, and so his face was familiar to millions of television viewers worldwide, in the corner of Centre Court, clutching his two-way radio and glancing upwards at the sky in search of rainclouds.\nTennis career.\nMills was himself an accomplished tennis player. At the age of 17 he was the senior county champion in his home county of Lancashire, and he reached the last 16 in the men's singles at Wimbledon on two occasions. Partnering compatriot Mark Cox he reached the semifinals of the 1966 Wimbledon doubles event. Mills was also the first man in the history of the Davis Cup to win a match with the scoreline 6–0, 6–0, 6–0, completing the match against Joseph Offenheim in just 32 minutes.\nMills was the first Englishman to defeat Rod Laver in 1961 at the London Hard Court Championships when the Australian came to Britain.\nIn 1965, he won the Dutch Covered Courts Championships, defeating Roger Taylor in the semifinal and Bobby Wilson in the final.\nThe following year he became a professional tennis coach and played matches on the professional tour.\nMills was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours for services to lawn tennis, and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours for services to sport.\nPersonal life and death.\nMills married English table tennis international Jill Rook in 1960. He died on 18 January 2024, at the age of 88."

        "title": "England women's cricket team",
        "text": "The England women's cricket team represents England and Wales in international women's cricket. Since 1998, they have been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously governed by the Women's Cricket Association. England is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council, with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. They are currently captained by Heather Knight and coached by Jon Lewis.\nThey played in the first ever Women's Test match in 1934, against Australia, which they won by 9 wickets. The two teams now compete regularly for The Women's Ashes. They played in the first Women's Cricket World Cup in 1973, winning the tournament on home soil, and have gone on to win the World Cup three more times, in 1993, 2009 and 2017. After their 2017 triumph, they were awarded the BBC Sports Team of the Year Award. They played in the first ever Twenty20 International in 2005, against New Zealand, and won the inaugural ICC Women's World Twenty20 in 2009.\nHistory.\nThe pioneers.\nEngland were a part of the first Women's Test series, as their team led by Betty Archdale touring Australia in the summer of 1934–35, three years after the Bodyline tour by the men. The team and their captain received \"warm\" responses from the Australian crowds. Winning both the first two Tests and drawing the third, England won the first women's test series, and also beat New Zealand by an innings and 337 runs on the way home, where Betty Snowball contributed an innings of 189, which was to remain a women's Test record for half a century. However, their leading player, and one of the best-known women cricketers of the era, was the allrounder Myrtle Maclagan. She scored the first ever century in a woman's Test match on 7 January 1935.\nTwo years later, England suffered their first Test defeat, at the hands of Australia at Northampton. As Australia made their inaugural tour, an England team including seven debutantes conceded 300 on the first day, and despite bowling Australia out for 102 in the second innings they lost by 31 runs. England recovered to take the second Test after a first-innings 115 from Myrtle Maclagan, who also took five wickets opening the bowling, and the third Test was drawn to ensure a 1–1 series tie.\nLosing the Ashes.\nEngland began playing women's Test cricket again in 1948–49, when they toured Australia for a three-Test match series. An England team with seven debutantes, lost the Women's Ashes to Australia after losing the first Test and drawing the final two. Two of their eleven made half-centuries on tour: Molly Hide, who also batted out the third day of the final Test to make England's only century in Australia this season to draw the game, and Myrtle Maclagan, who hit 77 in the second Test. Both had Test experience from before the War. Maclagan was also England's leading wicket-taker on tour, with nine wickets, ahead of Hide and Mary Johnson who took six each. However, England still beat New Zealand in their Test one month after the conclusion of the Ashes.\nIn 1951, Australia toured England for the first time in 14 years. After drawing the first Test at Scarborough, England gained a lead of 38 on first innings after Mary Duggan's five wickets, and set a target of 159, larger than any score in the previous three innings, and a record of that time. Australia were 131 for eight after Duggan took four more wickets, but England conceded 29 for the ninth wicket. Thus, they surrendered the Ashes again, despite winning the final Test by 137 runs after another Duggan nine-wicket-haul to draw the series at 1–1.\nEngland's next international series involve a visit from New Zealand in 1954. England won the first Test, despite giving up a deficit of 10 on first innings, but drew the second and third; the third Test saw a whole day's play lost to rain. Excluding one-offs, this was England's first series win since their inaugural series.\nEngland went on tour of Australasia once again in 1957–58, nine years after their previous tour, but by now Mary Duggan had taken over as captain. For a change, they began against New Zealand, where they drew both Tests; despite Duggan's five-for in the final innings, New Zealand closed on 203 for nine after being set 228 to win. They then moved on to Australia, where their series began with an abandoned match at North Sydney Oval in February, and the second Test at St Kilda had the first day rained off. When the teams came in to bat, though, Duggan set a women's Test record; she claimed seven Australian batters, all for single-digit scores, and in 14.5 overs she conceded six runs, bettering Maclagan's previous best of seven for 10. The record stood for 38 years. However, Betty Wilson replied with seven for seven as England were bowled out for 35, three short of Australia's total, and then made a second-innings hundred as Australia set a target of 206 in 64 overs. England lost eight wickets for 76, but still managed the draw, while Wilson claimed four wickets to become the first Test player to score a hundred and take ten wickets in a match.\nWilson also hit a hundred in the third Test at Adelaide, but Cecilia Robinson replied with a hundred of her own, lasting into the final day's play. With Ruth Westbrook and Edna Barker also scoring half-centuries, England gained a first-innings lead, but Australia batted out to make 78 for two and draw the game. The fourth Test was also drawn; England trailed by 27 going into the final day, but Robinson carried her bat to 96 not out as England survived 102.5 overs and set Australia a target of 162. England only got one wicket in reply, however, to draw the game.\nUnbeaten 1960s.\nAfter the 1950s, where England had lost two and won two Tests, England went through the 1960s without losing any of their 14 Tests, with the majority, ten, drawn. Their first series were against Test debutantes South Africa. Once again, the series had a majority of draws, but an England side captained by 23-year-old Helen Sharpe won the series 1–0 after claiming the third Test at Durban by eight wickets. South Africa gained first innings leads in the first and last Test, however, but followed on in the second Test which was affected by rain.\nIn 1963 England took what was to be their last series win over Australia for 42 years. In the first Test, England made 91 for three in the final innings, but in the second match at the North Marine Road Ground in Scarborough England were 97 behind with nine second-innings wickets in hand by the close of the second day. Wickets fell steadily throughout the third day, and England fell from 79 for four to 91 for nine; however, Eileen Vigor and June Bragger held on for the tenth wicket to draw the game. Three weeks later, the teams met for the third and final decider at The Oval, and captain Mary Duggan, in her last Test, scored her second Test century as England declared on 254 for eight. Australia replied with 205, then took two English wickets on the second day, and were set a target of 202. With Duggan and Anne Sanders doing the brunt of the bowling, England took the first nine wickets for 133, before Australia's No. 10 and 11 built a partnership. However, Edna Barker was brought on as the seventh bowler of the innings, and with her fourteenth ball she had Marjorie Marvell lbw to win the game for England.\nRachael Heyhoe-Flint took over the captaincy for the 1966 series against New Zealand, and made her first Test century in her very first Test as captain. New Zealand batted out the match losing twelve wickets, however, and the first Test was drawn. In the second, New Zealand recovered from a first innings deficit to set England a target of 157, which resulted in another draw, and in the third Test England were five for three overnight on the second day, trailing by 65. Another wicket was lost on the third morning, but England held on for 100 overs and set New Zealand 84 in nine overs to win the series. England conceded 35 and could not take a wicket, but still drew the game and the series 0 – 0.\nEngland next went on an Oceanian tour in 1968–69, defending the Ashes successfully after another 0 – 0 draw. Debutante Enid Bakewell, aged 28, made a hundred in the first Test, but Australia declared 69 ahead, and England batted out the third day to make 192 for seven; in the second Test Edna Barker registered a hundred, and England set a target of 181, but could only take five wickets for 108 in Australia's final innings. The decider at Sydney also saw a declaration, from Australia, who made 210 for three declared in their second innings, but England lost only six wickets in the chase to draw again.\nIn New Zealand, the same procedure followed: Bakewell scored her second Test hundred and took five wickets in the first drawn Test, where the third innings lasted 4.4 overs before the game was called off as a draw. She followed that up with 114 and eight wickets in the second Test, where England bowled out New Zealand for 186 on the final day, and chased 173 in 42.3 overs after 66 not out in the second innings from Bakewell, and in the third Test New Zealand were bowled out for 214 in 68.3 overs after being set 252 to win. Bakewell made 412 runs in her five Test innings in New Zealand, and coupled that with 19 wickets, and headed both the runs and wickets tally. On the entire tour, also including matches against other opposition, Bakewell scored 1,031 runs and took 118 wickets.\nFirst World Cup.\nWest Indies had not been granted Test status yet, but England went on two tours there in 1969–70 and 1970–71, sponsored by Sir Jack Hayward. Hayward had received letters from England captain Heyhoe-Flint asking for sponsorship, and after a conversation between the two in 1971, Hayward and the Women's Cricket Association agreed to organise the inaugural Women's World Cup, which was to become the first World Cup in cricket. England fielded two sides: a Young England side, who were bowled out for 57 by Australia in the first Women's One-day International, and the senior side. In addition, three English women, Audrey Disbury, Wendy Williams and Pamela Crain played for the International XI.\nYoung England won one game, against International XI, while the full-strength England side won four of their first five games. In the match with New Zealand, rain forced them off after 15 overs, at 34 for one needing 71 from the last 20, and New Zealand were declared winners on \"average run rate\". New Zealand were not a threat, however, having lost with two balls to spare against the International XI and by 35 runs against Australia. With the match between Australia and the International XI rained off, Australia went into the final game with a one-point advantage on England, but in \"gloriously\" fair weather at Edgbaston Enid Bakewell scored her second century of the tournament, and England tallied 273 for three. Bakewell also bowled 12 overs for 28, taking the wicket of top-scorer Jackie Potter, as England limited Australia to 187 in their 60 overs and won the World Cup.\n2005.\nIn the 2005 World Cup, England lost in the semi-finals to eventual winners Australia. However, England went on to win the two-Test series against Australia 1–0, claiming the Women's Ashes for the first time in 42 years. The One-Day series between the two sides was closely contested, with Australia winning the final match to take the series 3–2. The Women's team participated in the parade and celebrations held in Trafalgar Square alongside the victorious men's team.\nWith Clare Connor missing the 2005 winter tour, fluent middle order batsman Charlotte Edwards was named captain for the series against Sri Lanka and India, with England easily winning the two ODIs against Sri Lanka before drawing the one Test against India while losing the 5-match ODI series 4–1. Connor announced her retirement from international cricket in 2006, with Edwards now the official captain for the series against India in England.\n2008.\nDespite being written off as underdogs before the Australian tour began, England drew the one-day international series against Australia, two all, and retained the Ashes with a six wicket victory in the one-off test match at Bowral. Isa Guha took nine wickets in the test match, and won the player of the match award, while long serving middle order batsman, Claire Taylor scored two gritty fifties. Captain Charlotte Edwards hit the winning runs, as she had at the Sydney Cricket Ground in her 100th one day international.\n2009.\nEngland won the 2009 World Cup, held in Australia, defeating New Zealand by 4 wickets in the final at North Sydney Oval. They lost only one match in the tournament, against Australia, while they defeated India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. Claire Taylor was the most prolific batsman in the tournament and Laura Marsh the most successful bowler. Vice captain Nicki Shaw, restored to the team only due to injury to Jenny Gunn, took 4 wickets and hit a vital 17 not out to win the man of the match award in the final. Caroline Atkins, Sarah Taylor and captain Charlotte Edwards were prolific with the bat while bowlers Holly Colvin and Katherine Brunt dominated with the ball. Five England players were named in the composite ICC team of the tournament. Claire Taylor was named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year, the first woman to be honoured with the award in its 120-year history.\nEngland underlined their dominance of the women's game with victory in the inaugural Twenty/20 World Championship at Lords. After qualifying top of their preliminary group, defeating India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, they overcame a formidable Australian total in the semi-final, thanks to Claire Taylor's unbeaten 76. A spell of 3 for 6 by fast bowler Katherine Brunt saw New Zealand dismissed for 85 in the final at Lords and Player of the Series Claire Taylor saw England to victory with an unbeaten 39. England completed the season by retaining the Ashes with a draw in the one-off test at New Road, Worcestershire thanks to the fast bowling of Katherine Brunt, who took seven wickets, and dogged defensive batting from Beth Morgan, who batted nearly eight hours in the match.\n2012 World Twenty20.\nHeading into the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England were considered favourites after an 18-month unbeaten streak that only ended in the weeks before the tournament, in a series against the West Indies which England won 4–1. England were forced into a late change for the tournament during this series, when Susie Rowe fractured her thumb and was replaced by the uncapped Amy Jones. England were grouped with Australia, India and Pakistan in Group A, following their group stage exit in the previous World Twenty20.\nEngland began with a win over Pakistan, although they were somewhat unconvincing. After an opening stand of 102 between captain Charlotte Edwards and Laura Marsh, England only scored 31 runs in their final 7 overs to finish 133–6. Pakistan never really threatened to cause an upset, and were bowled out for 90 including 4-9 for Holly Colvin. However, Danielle Wyatt suffered an ankle injury whilst bowling and this limited her bowling input for the remainder of the group stage. Any unease at England's first performance was quashed with a thumping nine wicket win over India in their second game, which saw them qualify for the knockout stage. India were limited to 116-6 off their 20 overs, before another impressive stand of 78 from Edwards and Marsh ended the game as a contest, with Edwards ending on 50* and winning the player of the match award.\nEngland's final group game was against Australia, and whilst both sides had already qualified, the game was seen as a good chance to get a psychological advantage before a potential final match-up. Australia posted an impressive 144–5, despite an economical performance from Katherine Brunt, thanks to scores of 39 from Meg Lanning and 38 from Lisa Sthalekar. This time Marsh departed early, bringing Sarah Taylor to the crease, although England continued to struggle to keep with the run rate, losing both Edwards and Arran Brindle. However, Wyatt's arrival at the crease saw a partnership of 65 off 33 balls, leading England's to a comfortable victory, Taylor ending on 65* and Wyatt on 33*. England carried this momentum into their semi-final with New Zealand, Lydia Greenway effecting a run out in the first over to dismiss New Zealand captain Suzie Bates, and thereafter New Zealand were only able to post a disappointing effort of 93–8. England comfortably scored the runs, with contributions from Edwards, Taylor (who finished not out for the third successive game) and Greenway, and reached their second World Twenty20 final.\nThe final took place on 7 October, between England and Australia in Colombo. England maintained their tactic of bowling first when Edwards won the toss, although it was Australia who made the far better start, scoring 47 off their first 6 overs during the powerplay without losing a wicket. Lanning and Alyssa Healy were dismissed soon afterwards, with Colvin taking 2-21 off her 4 overs, but Jess Cameron scored 45 off 34 balls. Although after Cameron's dismissal Australia only scored 23 runs off their final 23 balls, they posted a competitive score of 142–4. England were unable to match Australia's fast start, and with the run rate climbing, Australia were able to take crucial wickets at important times, Ellyse Perry making a huge impact in having Taylor caught behind and taking the catches for both Edwards and Greenway's dismissals. When Brunt was bowled by Jess Jonassen first ball of the 17th over, England needed 42 off 23 balls with just 3 wickets left. Despite valiant efforts from Jenny Gunn and Danielle Hazell, Hazell was unable to hit the final ball of the match for six off Erin Osborne, and Australia won by 4 runs.\nDespite the defeat, Charlotte Edwards ended as the highest run scorer across the tournament, and was thus named player of the tournament. She was joined in the team of the tournament by Laura Marsh, Sarah Taylor and Katherine Brunt.\n2013 Women's World Cup.\nFollowing on from the disappointment of not winning the world Twenty20, England headed to India for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, defending their 2009 title. England added Georgia Elwiss to their squad from the World Twenty20, and were in Group A with Sri Lanka, West Indies and hosts India. England's tournament got off to a disastrous start, losing a thrilling match to the unfancied Sri Lanka. Sarah Taylor, Laura Marsh and Anya Shrubsole all missed the game injured, and Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted England to bat. The toss would prove crucial many times in this tournament, as the early start times meant that batting during the first hour was extremely difficult, and so it proved in this match, with Charlotte Edwards, Danielle Wyatt and Lydia Greenway all out within the first eight overs. Arran Brindle (31) and Heather Knight (38) lead the recovery, but as soon as England had gained the ascendancy they were both dismissed. It was left to vice-captain Jenny Gunn and debutant Amy Jones to get England to a defendable score, and they did, with Gunn making 52 and Jones 41. Some late hitting from Katherine Brunt and Danielle Hazell lifted England to 238–8, and it seemed as though the disaster the early wickets had promised had been averted. Sri Lanka however pulled off a stunning victory, Chamari Athapaththu scoring 62, and supported by Mendis and Siriwardene, put Sri Lanka in an extremely strong position. Brunt and Elwiss struck back for England, before a brutal 56 from Eshani Lokusuriyage took Sri Lanka to within a run of victory. She was run out in the final over, but Dilani Manodara hit the final ball of the match from Elwiss for six as Sri Lanka won by just one wicket, their first every victory over England.\nWhilst this result did not put England's chances of qualification in too much danger, it highlighted potential weaknesses for other sides to exploit. Taylor, Marsh and Shrubsole all returned for the second game against India, although England again lost the toss and found themselves batting. Whilst Goswami dismissed Wyatt cheaply, Edwards and Taylor both survived and then prospered. Taylor was run out for 35, but Edwards carried on, and reached her 7th ODI hundred, and when Brindle added 37*, England had reached 272–8. Despite 107* from Harmanpreet Kaur, England won by 32 runs, with the outstanding Brunt taking 4-29 from her 9 overs, and Holly Colvin's miserly spell where she conceded just 29 runs from her 10 overs. England's final game was against the West Indies, with only the winner guaranteed a spot in the super sixes. West Indies won the toss and surprisingly elected to bat, which soon backfired against Brunt and Shrubsole. West Indies were reduced to 31-6 and ended 101 all out, Shrubsole taking 4-21 and Brindle 3–0, although this was not achieved without worry for England as Edwards left the field ill and Brunt injured herself celebrating the wicket of Deandra Dottin. England achieved the target with 40 from Wyatt, taking them through to the next stage. However, Sri Lanka then gained another shock victory, over hosts India, taking them through along with England and West Indies. This result meant England carried through one win and one defeat instead of two wins, which would soon prove crucial.\nEngland's first game in the Super Sixes was against Australia, and the game began well for England, who won the toss having found out Australia would be missing their star pace bowler, Ellyse Perry, injured. Brunt and Shrubsole soon reduced Australia to 32–5, taking full advantage of early swing, before Lisa Sthalekar and Sarah Coyte managed to get Australia to a poor but not wholly uncompetitive 147 all out. England began poorly, and found themselves 39–6, including a second successive first ball duck for Taylor. Greenway made a gutsy 49, but her dismissal seemingly marked the end of the match. England needed 34 when their last pair of Holly Colvin and Anya Shrubsole came together, but they took England to within three runs of victory, before Erin Osborne crucially dismissed Colvin to win the game for Australia. England now needed other results to go in their favour to reach the final, but responded superbly, bowling South Africa out for just 77 in their next match, with Shrubsole again to the fore, taking outstanding figures of 10-5-17-5, and Wyatt picking up three cheap wickets. England achieved the target in just 9.3 overs, boosting their net run rate, vital should they finish level on points with another team.\nEngland went into their last Super Sixes match against New Zealand knowing that if Australia beat the West Indies and they beat New Zealand, they would reach the final. However, during the early stages of the match news came through that West Indies had staged a remarkable comeback victory over Australia, meaning those two teams would contest the final, and England and New Zealand would finish 3rd and 4th. The game lost some of its intensity after the news came through, but England posted 266–6, with Taylor scoring 88 and Edwards 54. New Zealand appeared to be well on the way to victory at 145–1, but good spells of bowling from Gunn and Colvin saw New Zealand collapse and England win by 15 runs. The same sides then contested the 3rd/4th place playoff, where the once again impressive Colvin helped limit New Zealand to 220–8. England successfully chased this target down to finish 3rd in the tournament, with Taylor, Greenway and Brindle supporting a match winning hundred from Edwards, who became the first woman to score 5,000 runs in ODIs as she finished 106*. Edwards, Brunt, Colvin and Shrubsole all were named in the team of the tournament, giving England the most representatives with four.\n2013 Ashes victory.\nEngland's summer began with a change in coaching structure, with the coach of the previous five years Mark Lane leaving, to be replaced by Paul Shaw. England began the summer with a 2 ODI, 2 Twenty20 international series against Pakistan, which was used as a chance to give some of the fringe and younger players international experience due to the need to expand the squad along with some residual injuries to senior players. England won the ODI series 2-0 and tied the Twenty20 series 1-1, with international debuts for Natalie Sciver, Lauren Winfield and Natasha Farrant.\nThe Ashes began with the four-day Test match at Wormsley, with Australia making strong progress on the first day, reaching 243–3 at the close on a slow pitch. This was extended to 331-6 declared before lunch on the second day, Sarah Elliott completing her maiden Test century. Arran Brindle departed early, but a flowing fifty partnership from Heather Knight and Sarah Taylor put England in the ascendancy. Taylor was dismissed by Holly Ferling as England dramatically slumped to 113-6 and were in sudden danger of being forced to follow on. That they did not was due to a partnership of 156 between Knight and Laura Marsh, which ultimately saw England cede only a lead of 17 to Australia. Knight, in only her second Test, scored 157 in nearly seven hours of chanceless batting, winning her the player of the match award. Marsh's innings, 55 off 304 balls and 343 minutes, was one of the slowest international fifties recorded but helped England escape from the trouble they were in. From the close of England's 1st innings the match petered out into a draw, the slow pitch preventing either side from forcing victory.\nWith the Ashes now contested across all three formats, the drawn Test meant that England would have to win the combined ODI and Twenty20 match series at least 8-4 (2 points for a win) to win back the Ashes. They began badly in the first ODI at Lords, where Australia batted first and scored 203–8, due to good performances from Katherine Brunt and Marsh with the ball. England began well if a little slowly but faded against the Australian spinners, as despite 61 from Edwards, they slumped to a 27 run defeat. England came back strongly in the second ODI at Hove, batting first and making 256–6 in their 50 overs. Edwards led the way with her 6th consecutive ODI fifty, with all of the top six making at least 26. Brunt and Anya Shrubsole then dismissed both openers, including the dangerous Meg Lanning for zero, and despite 81 from Jess Cameron, England won by 51 runs, although Marsh injured her shoulder and missed the remainder of the series. The final ODI again took place at Hove, and after rain reduced the game to 36 overs a side, Australia scored an imposing 203–4, led by Lanning's 64. The Australia innings was notable for the remarkable dismissal of Australian captain Jodie Fields, who was brilliantly caught one-handed by Taylor as Fields attempted to reverse sweep Danielle Hazell. England chased down this target impressively, as after Edwards early dismissal, Knight and Taylor combined for a partnership of 126 in 18 overs. They fell for 69 and 64 respectively, but Sciver and Gunn saw England home and into a series lead.\nThe Twenty20 series began at a packed Chelmsford, and England posted 146–4, owing much to Taylor, who made 77. Australia's reply never got started until some late hitting from Perry and Haynes, but England won by 15 runs despite to loss of Shrubsole to injury to move within one victory of winning the series. In the next game at the Rose Bowl, Australia batted first and made 127–7, Hazell bowling well to take 2-11 off her 4 overs. England's reply began poorly when they slumped to 9–3, but Lydia Greenway, who made an unbeaten 80 off 64 balls, led England to both victory in the match and series, with the number of commentators praising her innings for its quality under pressure. England then thumped a deflated Australia in the final match of the series, taking the Ashes 12–4. Australia could only manage 91-7 off their 20 overs against a very disciplined performance from England's bowlers and fielders, and after the loss of three early wickets, Greenway and Sciver saw England to a comfortable win. Knight, who tore her hamstring in the final match, collected the player of the series award.\n2014–present: professional era.\nIn February 2014, the ECB decided to invest in the women's game providing central contracts to 18 players by May.\nIn October 2019, national director Clare Connor announced plans to grow all areas of the women's game, with the addition of 40 new full-time contracted players.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial announcement of players was delayed until June 2020, where the ECB announced the first 25 of 40 players to receive the new regional retainers contracts. The split of the full 40 players will be made up of 5 players from each of the grouped 8 regions.\nStatus of Wales.\nThe England women's cricket team, as a part of the England and Wales Cricket Board, represents both England and Wales. Welsh cricketers such as Lynne Thomas have therefore played for England.\nCricket Wales has continually supported the ECB, and the Wales women's national cricket team effectively functions as a domestic team within the women's county cricket structure, competing in the Women's County Championship until 2019 and continuing to compete in the Women's Twenty20 Cup. Wales is included as part of the country's new regional domestic structure and is part of the Western Storm regional hub, as well as being represented by Welsh Fire in The Hundred.\nThe absence of a Welsh cricket team that compete internationally in men's cricket has led to a number of comments from politicians and debates within the Senedd. It is unclear, however, whether these calls extend to the women's game. Wales did compete internationally in the Women's European Championship in 2005, as the tournament was held in Wales, playing against England and three other European women's cricket sides.\nTournament history.\nWomen's European Cricket Championship.\n\"(Note: England sent a Development Squad to every European Championship tournament, but it was only specifically referred to as such in 2005 &amp; 2007).

        "text": "The Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), currently titled as the Tata Steel Professional Golf Tour of India for sponsorship reasons, is a professional golf tour for men based in India. The tour was formed in 2006, as the successor to the Indian PGA Golf Tour, which ran from 1997 to 2006.\nThe PGTI serves as a feeder tour for higher level tours such as the Asian Tour. Many Indian players have become members of the Asian Tour, while a small number have joined the world's leading two tours, the European Tour and the United States-based PGA Tour.\nThe PGTI became a member of the International Federation of PGA Tours in 2009, but its events did not carry Official World Golf Ranking points unless they were co-sanctioned by tours that are included in the world ranking system. In July 2018, the OWGR announced that the PGTI would receive world ranking points in its own right beginning in 2019.\nHistory.\nIndia's Royal Calcutta Golf Club was founded in 1829 and is usually regarded as the oldest outside the United Kingdom. In the early years Indian golf with dominated by British players and it was not until 1949 that Mohinder Bal became the first Indian to win the All-India Amateur Championship. The Indian Golf Union (IGU) was founded in 1955 to take over responsibility for Indian Golf, which had previously been largely in the hands of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. The sport was still dominated by amateurs at that point, but most of them were now Indian.\nIn 1957 the IGU started a training program for caddies and professionals. In 1964 the Indian Open (open to both amateurs and professionals), was established and it soon replaced the All-India Amateur as the leading golf tournament in the country. Australian and five time British Open champion Peter Thomson used to stop over in India on his way from Australia to Europe, and he won the championship in 1964, 1966 and 1976. P. G. Sethi (an amateur) was the first Indian to win this tournament in 1965. In 1970 the Indian Open became part of the Asia Golf Circuit, the predecessor of the Asian Tour. In 1991 Ali Sher (a professional golfer) won the Indian Open, which made professional golf a much more attractive career option in India.\nThe Professional Golfers Association of India was founded in 1988 and several additional professional events were founded in India in the 1990s. From 1997 to 2006, the PGA of India Tour was managed by Tiger Sports Marketing on behalf of the PGA of India. Total prize money for the 2004/05 season was ( at 31 December 2004 exchange rate). There were around 20 events in the season, including tournaments in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\nIn October 2006 a group of leading Indian golfers including Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei announced that they were setting up a new tour. This followed a dispute between the Professional Golfers Association of India and Tiger Sports Marketing, the organisers of the PGA of India Tour. The BBC reported that it was not clear whether this tour would simply take the place of the existing tour, or whether rival tours might develop. In the event, the new tour, the Professional Golf Tour of India, took over as India's sole domestic professional tour, though Tiger Sports Marketing remained involved in other aspects of Indian golf.\nThe PGTI's schedule expanded rapidly in its first few seasons. In 2010 there were twenty-five events on the main schedule, including two co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour and one co-sanctioned with the European Tour, plus seven events on the Feeder Tour, which debuted that year. In 2011 the tour co-sanctioned an event with the European Tour's developmental circuit, the Challenge Tour, for the first time.\nIn December 2022, it was announced by the European Tour that the Professional Golf Tour of India had entered into a partnership with them and the PGA Tour. As part of the partnership, the leading player on the PGTI Order of Merit was given status onto the European Tour for the following season."

        "text": "Robert John Shaw (June 29, 1933 – September 23, 2010) was an American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, he played in Major League Baseball on seven teams for 11 seasons, from 1957 to 1967. In 1962, he was a National League (NL) All-Star player. In 1966, he led all National League pitchers with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage.\nCareer.\nShaw made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers on August 11, 1957. The Tigers traded Shaw and Ray Boone to the Chicago White Sox for Tito Francona and Bill Fischer on June 15, 1958. In 1959, Shaw won 18 games for the American League pennant-winning White Sox. The White Sox faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1959 World Series. Shaw defeated Sandy Koufax with a 1–0 shutout in Game 5, but the Dodgers defeated the White Sox in six games.\nThe White Sox traded Shaw, Wes Covington, Stan Johnson, and Gerry Staley to the Kansas City Athletics for Andy Carey, Ray Herbert, Don Larsen, and Al Pilarcik. The Athletics traded Shaw and Lou Klimchock to the Milwaukee Braves for Joe Azcue, Ed Charles, and Manny Jiménez on December 15, 1961.\nThe Braves traded Shaw, Del Crandall, and Bob Hendley to the San Francisco Giants for Felipe Alou, Ed Bailey, Billy Hoeft, and a player to be named later on December 3, 1963. The New York Mets purchased Shaw from the Giants for an undisclosed price above the $20,000 waiver price on June 10, 1966, The Mets sold Shaw to the Chicago Cubs for the waiver price on July 24, 1967. The Cubs released Shaw on September 14.\nShaw holds the major league record for the most balks by a pitcher in one game. He balked five times pitching for the Braves on May 4, 1963, against the Cubs. While he pitched for the Giants in 1964, Shaw taught Gaylord Perry how to throw a spitball, as well as how to hide that he was throwing it from the umpires and opposing team. Perry revealed this in his 1974 autobiography \"Me and the Spitter\".\nShaw became a pitching coach in Minor League Baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. The Milwaukee Brewers hired Shaw as their pitching coach, for former teammate Del Crandall, on September 15, 1972. Shaw resigned on July 15, 1973, after a dispute with Brewers general manager Jim Wilson.\nAfter retiring from Major League Baseball, Shaw remained active in the game by becoming a coach in the American Legion baseball program where he served for many years. In 1986, Shaw coached Jensen Beach Post 126 to the American Legion World Series title.\nPersonal life.\nShaw worked as a realtor in Northern Palm Beach County, becoming the co-owner of a commercial real estate firm in Tequesta, Florida. He worked until becoming sick in May 2010.\nShaw died of liver cancer on September 23, 2010, in Tequesta, where he lived."

        "title": "David Ross (baseball)",
        "text": "David Wade Ross (born March 19, 1977) is an American former professional baseball catcher and manager. He managed the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2020 to 2023. He played in MLB for 15 seasons.\nRoss played college baseball for Auburn University and the University of Florida and participated in two College World Series. He started his major league career playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2002 and also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago Cubs. Ross had two World Series wins, one with the Boston Red Sox in 2013 and the Chicago Cubs in 2016. The Cubs named him their manager prior to the 2020 season.\nEarly years.\nRoss was born in Bainbridge, Georgia, in 1977, but was raised in Tallahassee, Florida. He was born into a family of athletes—his father, David Ross Sr., played in a men's softball league, and his mother, Jackie, played basketball. Ross's uncles were both football players in college. He attended Florida State University's laboratory school, Florida High School, in Tallahassee, Florida, where he played high school baseball for the Florida High School Demons. Ross is one of five children; he has an older sister, Shannon, and a younger sister, Nikki.\nCollege career.\nRoss received an athletic scholarship to attend Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, where he played for the Auburn Tigers baseball team from 1996 to 1997. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The defining moment of his college career came in the semifinal of the East Regional tournament during the 1997 College World Series when he hit a walk-off three-run home run against Florida State to advance to the regional final. The Auburn Tigers would advance to the College World Series, getting knocked out in the 2nd round by Stanford. He transferred to the University of Florida after the 1997 season, and played one additional season of college baseball for the Florida Gators baseball team in 1998. Ross is one of the few players to have played in the College World Series with two different colleges, first with the Tigers in 1997, and then the Gators in 1998. Ross decided to forgo his final season of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility after his junior season with the Gators, when he was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nPlaying career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nRoss was drafted in the 19th round of the 1995 amateur draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but did not sign and accepted a scholarship to attend Auburn University instead. In 1998, the Dodgers drafted Ross again, this time in the seventh round.\nRoss made his MLB debut on June 29, 2002, striking out as a pinch hitter. On September 2, 2002, with the Dodgers leading 18–0, the Diamondbacks put first baseman Mark Grace in to pitch after he volunteered, to rest the bullpen. Ross hit his first major league home run off Grace with two outs in the 9th inning, capping a 19–1 win. Ross's Dodger career was stalled, however, by the large number of catchers in the Dodger system. Paul Lo Duca was the starting catcher through most of Ross's time in Los Angeles, and teammates like Brent Mayne, Koyie Hill, and Todd Hundley competed with him for playing time. Ross stayed with the team until 2004.\nPittsburgh Pirates / San Diego Padres.\nThe Dodgers sold Ross's contract to the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 30, 2005. After 40 games with the Pirates, he was traded to the San Diego Padres on July 28, 2005, for infielder J. J. Furmaniak. He played in 11 games with the Padres.\nCincinnati Reds.\nThe Padres traded Ross to the Cincinnati Reds during spring training for the 2006 season. On January 15, 2006, Ross signed a two-year, $4.54 million contract with the Reds.\nWhile Ross was most often used as the \"personal catcher\" for right-hander Bronson Arroyo, whom the Reds received in a spring training trade with the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Wily Mo Peña, the consensus among Reds fans was that Ross had proven himself deserving of being the everyday catcher due to his better offensive numbers and that one of the other Reds catchers, Jason LaRue or Javier Valentín, should have been traded (possibly as part of a package deal) for a relief pitcher. LaRue was the one most frequently cited, but no deal was made by the July 31 trade deadline.\nOn November 20, 2006, LaRue was traded to the Kansas City Royals for a player to be named later. Ross's 2007 season started with four hits in 38 at-bats with no home runs and 17 strikeouts. On April 21, 2007, his slump hit rock-bottom when with runners on first and second base, he grounded into a rare 5–4–3 triple play against the Philadelphia Phillies. Ross finished the 2007 season with a .203 batting average and 17 home runs. On August 10, 2008, Ross was designated for assignment and was released on August 18.\nBoston Red Sox.\nRoss signed a minor-league contract with the Boston Red Sox on August 22, 2008. He came up to the MLB club on August 29 and became a free agent after the season.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves signed Ross to a two-year, $3 million deal on December 5, 2008.\nIn 2009, Ross hit .273 in 54 games. On July 27, 2010, he signed a two-year extension to stay with the Braves through 2012. He managed to hit a career-high .289 for the Braves in 59 games in 2010.\nRoss was the Atlanta Braves secondary catcher behind Brian McCann for his four seasons with the Braves. His hot start in the 2011 season (hitting .333 after starting seven games, with three home runs) highlighted his strengths, as Ross has always been known as a strong defensive catcher (in 2009, he committed one error in 52 games). Ross hit the first ever home run in the Wild Card Game when the new playoff format was introduced in 2012.\nBoston Red Sox (second stint).\nRoss signed a two-year, $6.2 million deal on November 10, 2012, to return to the Red Sox as \"more than a backup but not a starter\" behind primary catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia.\nRoss suffered two concussions during the 2013 season and spent over two months on the disabled list; however, his health returned and he played a key role in Boston's run to the World Series championship over the St. Louis Cardinals that year, starting in four games during the series and driving in the game-winning run with an RBI double in Game 5. He was also behind the plate to catch the series-clinching out in Game 6 when Koji Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter.\nIn 2014, Ross played as Jon Lester's personal catcher.\nChicago Cubs.\nThe Chicago Cubs announced on December 23, 2014, that they had signed Ross to a two-year, $5 million contract.\nOn May 9, 2015, in his first appearance as a pitcher in his professional baseball career, Ross recorded a perfect inning against the Milwaukee Brewers. On July 26, he repeated the feat against the Philadelphia Phillies, then led off the next inning by hitting a home run off of Héctor Neris.\nOn April 21, 2016, Ross caught his first no-hitter, against the Cincinnati Reds, his former team, with starting pitcher Jake Arrieta. Ross hit his 100th career home run off of Adam Morgan of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 27, 2016.\nRoss announced his plans to retire following the 2016 season, after playing 15 seasons in the major leagues. During Game 7 of the 2016 MLB World Series against the Cleveland Indians, Ross hit a home run, making him the oldest player to do so in World Series history at 39 years old. The Cubs went on to win Game 7 8–7 in 10 innings, earning Ross his second World Series ring. On January 14, 2017, the Cubs named Ross as a special assistant to baseball operations for the 2017 season.\nKansas Stars.\nFollowing his retirement from MLB, Ross joined the Kansas Stars, an independent baseball team made of former MLB stars who play an abbreviated tournament lasting a few weeks out of the year.\nPost-playing career.\nThe Cubs named Ross a special assistant after his retirement. ESPN hired Ross as a baseball color analyst in January 2017.\nManagerial career.\nOn October 24, 2019, the Cubs hired Ross as their manager to replace Joe Maddon, signing him to a three-year contract. Ross began his managerial career on July 24, 2020, with a 3–0 win at home against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nOn March 11, 2022, the Cubs announced they agreed to a contract extension with Ross through the 2024 season. The deal includes a club option for the 2025 season as well. \nAfter the Cubs missed the playoffs in 2023 and team underperformance there was a growing call for Ross to be dismissed. Nevertheless, this was rejected by the Cubs’ ownership and front office, who stated that they were staying with Ross through 2024. However, Ross was dismissed on November 6, 2023, and Craig Counsell was hired to be the Cubs’ next manager.\n\"Dancing with the Stars\".\nOn March 1, 2017, Ross was revealed as one of the contestants on season 24 of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and was paired with professional dancer Lindsay Arnold. Ross is the first professional baseball player ever to compete on the show. Despite only having the sixth-highest scoring average, Ross and Arnold outlasted higher-scoring couples and ended up placing runner-up to winner Rashad Jennings and partner Emma Slater.\nPersonal life.\nRoss is divorced from Hyla Ross as of 2020. Together they have three children. As of 2016, they resided in Tallahassee, Florida.\nRoss is a Christian. He has worked with several Chicago charities, including Cradles to Crayons, that benefits underprivileged Chicago youth.\nRoss worked with author Don Yaeger, on a book titled \"Teammate: My Life in Baseball,\" which was published in May 2017.\nRoss has made an appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" along with some of his teammates, to celebrate the Cubs championship win.

        "title": "2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids",
        "text": "The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was the process by which the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selected locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition. By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively. The selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the FIFA Executive Committee had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or prosecuted for corruption.\nBackground.\nIn October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead, countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving Africa ineligible for 2018 and South America ineligible for both 2018 and 2022. Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round exhaustive ballot system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority.\nRotation policy.\nFollowing the selection of the 2006 World Cup hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations — roughly corresponding to continents – would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the 2010 (South Africa) and 2014 World Cup (Brazil) hosts, open only to CAF and CONMEBOL members, respectively.\nIn September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations. This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in Zürich, Switzerland by FIFA's executive committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from CONCACAF, AFC, UEFA, or OFC, as Africa and South America were ineligible. Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could make a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.\nThe United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament would have to be held in Europe. This in turn meant that CONMEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.\nVoting procedure.\nFor both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a tied vote, FIFA President Sepp Blatter would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of selling votes.\n2018 bids.\nEleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering thirteen nations, with two joint bids: Belgium-Netherlands and Portugal-Spain. Mexico also submitted a bid, but withdrew theirs on 28 September 2009, while Indonesia had their bid rejected for lack of government support on 19 March 2010. Five of the remaining nine bids, South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and United States were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others bid for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However, since all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted either of the two preceding tournaments are not eligible to host, all UEFA bids were forced to be for 2018 only. Four bids came from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), four from Europe's UEFA, and one from CONCACAF. It had also been reported on the FIFA website that Egypt was entering a bid, but the president of the Egyptian Football Association denied that any more than an inquiry in principle had been made.\nBelgium and the Netherlands.\nAlain Courtois, a Belgian Member of Parliament, announced in October 2006 that a formal bid would be made on behalf of the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\nIn June 2007 the three countries launched their campaign not as a joint bid in the manner of the Korea-Japan World Cup in 2002, but emphasising it as a common political organisation. Luxembourg would not host any matches or automatically qualify for the finals in a successful Benelux bid, but would host a FIFA congress.\nBelgium and the Netherlands registered their intention to bid jointly in March 2009. A delegation led by the presidents of the Belgian and Dutch national football associations met FIFA president Sepp Blatter on 14 November 2007, officially announcing their interest in submitting a joint bid. On 19 March 2008 the delegation also met with UEFA President Michel Platini to convince him that it was a serious offer under one management. Afterwards they claimed to have impressed Platini, who supports the idea of getting the World Cup to Europe. Former French football international Christian Karembeu was presented as official counselor for the joint bid on 23 June 2009.\nA factor that was against the Benelux bid was the lack of an 80,000 capacity stadium to host the final.\nHowever, the city council of Rotterdam gave permission in March 2009 for development of a new stadium with a capacity of around 80,000 seats to be completed in time for the possible World Cup in 2018.\nIn November 2009, the venues were presented. In Belgium, matches would have been played in 7 venues: Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Charleroi, Genk, Ghent and Liège. In the Netherlands, only five cities would host matches: Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Enschede, Heerenveen and Rotterdam, but both Amsterdam and Rotterdam would provide two stadiums. Eindhoven would function as the 'capital city' of the World Cup. Euro 2000 was also jointly hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands.\nEngland.\nOn 31 October 2007, The Football Association officially announced its bid to host the event. On 24 April 2008 England finalised a 63-page bid to host the 2018 World Cup, focusing on the development of football worldwide. On 27 January 2009, England officially submitted their bid to FIFA.\nRichard Caborn led England's bid to stage the event after stepping down as Sports Minister. On 24 October 2008 the Football Association named the executive board to prepare the bid, with David Triesman as the bid chairman. Triesman resigned on 16 May 2010 after comments were published where he suggested that Spain would drop their bid if Russia helped bribe referees in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and was then replaced by Geoff Thompson.\nThe British government backed the England 2018 bid. In November 2005, Chancellor Gordon Brown and Sport Minister Tessa Jowell first announced that they were to investigate the possibility of bidding.\nThat month, Adrian Bevington, the Football Association's Director of Communications, announced the support of the Government and the Treasury in the bid, but put off definite proposals.\nBrown reiterated his support for a bid in March 2006, before England's 2006 World Cup campaign, and again in May 2006.\nThe UK government launched its official report on 12 February 2007, in which it was made clear that its support was for an England-only bid and that all games would be played at English grounds. The venues selected on 16 December 2009 to form the bid were: London (three stadiums), Manchester (two stadiums), Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Nottingham, Plymouth, Sheffield and Sunderland.\nFIFA officials also expressed interest in an English bid. David Will, a vice-president of FIFA, noted England's World Cup proposal as early as May 2004.\nFranz Beckenbauer, leader of Germany's successful bid for the 2006 World Cup and a member of FIFA's executive committee, twice publicly backed an English bid to host the World Cup, in January and July 2007.\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter said he would welcome a 2018 bid from \"the homeland of football.\"\nBlatter met David Cameron on two occasions to discuss the bid while paying visits to England. The British Prime Minister showed much support for the bid and was hopeful that the \"home of football\" would host the tournament.\nIn an interview the leader of Russia's bid, Alexei Sorokin, criticised England's bid citing London's high crime rate, alcohol consumption among young people and English fans \"inciting ethnic hatred.\" England filed a complaint, though the complaint was withdrawn following Russia's apology.\nPortugal and Spain.\nThe President of the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF), Gilberto Madail, first proposed a joint bid with Spain in November 2007. The bid intent was confirmed by FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, on 18 February 2008.\nHowever, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Angel Villar, announced in July 2008 that it was Spain's intention to submit an individual World Cup bid, and that positive contacts had already taken place with the government, through the secretary of sports, Jaime Lissavetzky. No specifications were made then regarding a joint bid with Portugal. On 23 November 2008, after his re-election for the RFEF presidency, Villar pledged that one of the fundamental objectives of his term was to bring a World Cup to Spain. While he did not mention whether Spain would present a joint bid with Portugal, he did not rule it out when asked about it.\nOn 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated \"We need to present a strong, consistent and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup.\" He further confessed \"Personally, I think it should be with Portugal.\" Subsequently, in the aftermath of a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper \"Marca\" advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively. Spain has previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, while Portugal organised the Euro 2004.\nRussia.\nRussia announced its intent to bid in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time. The bid committee also included RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations.\nFourteen cities were included in the proposal, which divided them into five different clusters: one in the north, centered on Saint Petersburg, a central cluster, centered on Moscow, a southern cluster, centered on Sochi, and the Volga River cluster. Only one city beyond the Ural Mountains was cited, Yekaterinburg. The other cities were: Kaliningrad in the north cluster, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar in the south cluster and Yaroslavl, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Saransk, Samara and Volgograd in the Volga River cluster. At the time of bidding, Russia did not have a stadium with 80,000 capacity, but the bid called for the expansion of Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, already a UEFA Elite stadium, from a capacity of slightly over 78,000 to over 89,000. Russia hoped to have five stadiums fit to host World Cup matches ready by 2013 – two in Moscow and one stadium each in Saint Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, which at the time was due to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n2022 bids.\nAustralia.\nIn September 2007, the Football Federation Australia confirmed that Australia would bid for the 2018 World Cup finals.\nPreviously, in late May 2006, the Victorian sports minister, Justin Madden, said that he wanted his state to drive a bid to stage the 2018 World Cup. Frank Lowy, the FFA chairman, stated that they aimed to use 16 stadiums for the bid.\nThen Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the Federal Government's support for the bid,\nand in December 2008, Federal minister for sport Kate Ellis announced that the federal government would give the FFA $45.6 million to fund its World Cup bid preparation.\nRudd met with Sepp Blatter to discuss the Commonwealth Government's support of the bid in Zürich in July 2009.\nAt the 2008 FIFA Congress, held in Sydney, FIFA president Sepp Blatter suggested that Australia concentrate on hosting the 2022 tournament, but Lowy responded by recommitting Australia to its 2018 bid. However, Australia ultimately withdrew from the bidding for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in favour of the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 10 June 2010, following comments from the chief of the Asian Football Confederation that the 2018 tournament should be held in Europe.\nAustralia's largest stadiums are currently used by other major Australian sports whose domestic seasons overlap with the World Cup. The Australian Football League and National Rugby League claimed that loss of access to these major venues for eight weeks would severely disrupt their seasons and impact the viability of their clubs. The AFL in particular had previously advised it would not relinquish Etihad Stadium in Melbourne for the entire period required. On 9 May 2010 the AFL, NRL, and FFA announced a Memorandum of Understanding guaranteeing that the AFL and NRL seasons would continue, should the bid be successful. Compensation for the rival football codes would be awarded as a result of any disruptions caused by hosting the World Cup. AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou came out in support of the bid, despite initially not supporting the bid. Franz Beckenbauer indicated that the issue of factional disputes between the FFA, NRL and, AFL were not considered by the FIFA Executive Committee. Although initially Australia seemed to be a popular contender to host the tournament, the final Australian World Cup bid received only one vote astonishing Franz Beckenbauer and experts alike.\nJapan.\nJapan bid to become the first Asian country to host the World Cup twice; however, the fact that they were co-hosts so recently in 2002 was expected to work against them in their bid. Although Japan did not have an 80,000-seat capacity stadium, its plan was based on a proposed 100,000-seat stadium that would have gone on to be a centrepiece of 2016 Olympics, for which Tokyo was bidding.\nJapan also pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players. Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.\nThe Olympic bid was unsuccessful, coming third in the bidding process that concluded in October 2009. The vice-president of the Japan Football Association, Junji Ogura, had previously admitted that if Tokyo were to fail in its bid, its chances of hosting either the 2018 or 2022 World Cup would not be very good. On 4 May 2010, Japan announced that it was withdrawing its bid for the 2018 tournament to focus on 2022, amidst rising speculation that the 2018 edition will be held in Europe.\nQatar.\nQatar made a bid for only the 2022 World Cup. Qatar was attempting to become the first Arab country to host the World Cup. Failed bids from other Arab countries include Morocco (1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010), Egypt and a Libya-Tunisia joint bid withdrew in the 2010 World Cup bidding process.\nSheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of the former Emir of Qatar, was the chairman of the bid committee.\nQatar planned to promote the bid as an Arab unity bid and hoped to draw on support from the entire Arab world and were positioning this as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab and Western worlds. The bid launched an advertising campaign across the nation in November 2009.\nSome concerns with Qatar's bid deal with the extreme temperatures. The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40 °C (104 °F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30 °C (86 °F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying \"the event has to be organised in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well.\" The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.\nPresident of FIFA Sepp Blatter endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Middle East, saying in April 2010, \"The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organise the tournament.\" Blatter also praised Qatar's progress, \"When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question.\" Qatar's bid to host the 2022 World Cup received a huge boost on 28 July 2010 when Asian Football Confederation (AFC) President Mohammed Bin Hammam threw his weight behind his country's campaign. Speaking in Singapore, Bin Hammam said: \"I have one vote and, frankly speaking, I will vote for Qatar but if Qatar is not in the running I will vote for another Asian country.\" Qatar has already hosted the AFC Asian Cup in 1988, FIFA U-20 World Cup 1995 and the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea bid only for the 2022 World Cup. They were bidding to become the first Asian country to host the World Cup twice; however, the fact that they were co-hosts so recently in 2002 was expected to work against them in their bid. Han Seung-joo, a former South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the Chairman of the Bidding Committee in August 2009. He met with FIFA President Sepp Blatter in Zürich, Switzerland. In January 2010, President Lee Myung-bak visited the headquarters of FIFA in Zürich, Switzerland to meet Sepp Blatter in support of the South Korean bid.\nAlthough South Korea did not have an 80,000 capacity stadium, it planned to upgrade an existing venue to meet that capacity. There are three grounds which can seat over 60,000 people—Seoul Olympic Stadium, Seoul World Cup Stadium and Daegu Stadium. Another 70,000 seat stadium is scheduled to be built in Incheon as the main stadium for the 2014 Asian Games. Other venues meet hosting requirements as they were built for the 2002 World Cup. The 12 cities selected to hold the finals were South Korea to win the bid were selected in March 2010 and were Busan, Cheonan, Daegu, Daejeon, Goyang, Gwangju, Incheon (2 venues), Jeonju, Seogwipo, Seoul (2 venues), Suwon and Ulsan.\nUnited States.\nU.S. Soccer first said in February 2007 that it would bid for the 2018 World Cup. On 28 January 2009, U.S. Soccer then announced that it would submit bids for both the 2018 and 2022 Cups. David Downs, president of Univision Sports, was executive director of the bid. Other committee members included president of U.S. Soccer Sunil Gulati, U.S. Soccer chief executive officer Dan Flynn, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber, and Phil Murphy, the former national finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee. The vice president of FIFA, Jack Warner, who is also the president of CONCACAF, originally said he would try to bring the World Cup back to the CONCACAF region.\nHowever, Warner also stated that he preferred the USSF change their plans to make a bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nIn April 2009, the bid committee identified 70 stadiums in 50 communities as possible venues for the tournament, with 58 confirming their interest. The list of stadiums was trimmed two months later to 45 in 37 cities, and then in August 2009 to 32 stadiums in 27 cities. In January 2010, 18 cities and 21 stadiums were selected for the final bid. The cities were Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston (Foxboro), Dallas, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. The cities with multiple qualifying stadiums were Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas and Washington. With several large American football stadiums, the 21 venues were to have an average capacity of 77,000; none seated fewer than 65,000. Seven of the stadiums seat at least 80,000. Two proposed stadiums would be used by Major League Soccer during the summer.\nIn October 2010, the United States withdrew from the 2018 bid process, to focus solely on the 2022 competition.\nCancelled bids.\nTwo countries had to cancel bids for the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cups before individual evaluations began. Mexico cancelled its bid for both cups, while Indonesia was only bidding for the 2022 World Cup.\nIndonesia.\nIn January 2009 the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) confirmed their intention to bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with government support. In February 2009, PSSI launched the \"Green World Cup Indonesia 2022\" campaign.\nThis campaign included a $1 billion plan to upgrade supporting infrastructure beside stadiums to meet FIFA's requirements. The funds to construct stadiums were to come from regional governments. Indonesia had previously made World Cup history when it became the first Asian nation to play in a World Cup, at the 1938 tournament in France under its colonial name of the Dutch East Indies. Indonesia also had tournament hosting experience as the co-host of 2007 AFC Asian Cup.\nIn the campaign presentation, PSSI president Nurdin Halid said he believed Indonesia stood a chance to win FIFA's approval to host the 2022 World Cup, despite the relatively poor infrastructure, coupled with the low quality of the national squad compared to other candidates. He said Indonesia had proposed a \"Green World Cup 2022\", hoping to capitalise on the current green and global warming movement worldwide: \"Our deforestation rate has contributed much to world pollution. By hosting the World Cup, we wish to build infrastructure and facilities that are environmentally friendly so we can give more to the planet.\"\nThe bid was launched at a moment when there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid to step down from his position as chairman of PSSI. There was no official support from the government of Indonesia until 9 February 2010, the deadline for the country's government to file a letter of support for the bid. Secretary General of PSSI Nugraha Besoes did not deny that Indonesia could be disqualified from the bidding process because the Indonesian government did not support the bid. On 19 March 2010, FIFA rejected Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup because the government stated that their concern is for the people of the country and so could not support the bid as FIFA requested. As a consequence, PSSI threw their support behind Australia's bid for the 2022 tournament.\nMexico.\nFormer Mexican Football Federation President, Alberto de la Torre, announced their intention to bid for the cup in 2005, but was ineligible because of the rotation policy at that time.\nSelection.\nVoting rounds.\nOn 2 December 2010, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced the winning bids at FIFA's headquarters in Zürich. Russia was chosen to host the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 World Cup. This made Russia the first Eastern European country to host the World Cup, while Qatar would be the first Middle Eastern country to host the World Cup.\nBlatter noted that the committee had decided to \"go to new lands\" and reflected a desire to \"develop football\" by bringing it to more countries.\nIn each round a majority of twelve votes was needed. If no bid received 12 votes in a round, the bid with the fewest votes in that round was eliminated, and accordingly each remaining bid should receive no fewer votes in subsequent rounds than in preceding rounds. Multiple bids received fewer votes in voting round 2 compared to voting round 1 (Netherlands/Belgium, Qatar and Japan), at least 2 voting members in each of the 2018 and 2022 votes changed their votes between voting rounds despite their initial bid not being eliminated in voting round 1. The actual votes cast were as follows:\nAllegations of vote-buying.\nShortly after the voting in December 2010, ESPN published allegations linking Qatar's successful bid to Football Dreams, a youth development program that channeled money from the Qatari government to football programs in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia—six of which had representatives on the FIFA executive committee. In February 2011, Blatter admitted that the Spanish and Qatari bid teams did try to trade votes, \"but it didn't work\".\nIn May 2011, the former England 2018 bid chief Lord Treisman told a House of Commons select committee that four FIFA committee members approached him asking for various things in exchange for votes. Among the accused were FIFA Vice President Jack Warner, who allegedly asked for £2.5 million to be used for projects, and Nicolás Leoz, who allegedly asked to be knighted. \"The Sunday Times\" further reported that month that Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were given $1.5 million in exchange for their votes in favor of Qatar. On 30 May 2011, FIFA President Sepp Blatter rejected the evidence in a press conference, while Jack Warner, who had been suspended that day for a separate ethics violations pending an investigation, leaked an email from FIFA General Secretary Jérôme Valcke which suggested that Qatar had \"bought\" the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\". Qatar officials denied any impropriety. Theo Zwanziger, President of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the Cup to Qatar.\nIn July 2012, FIFA appointed former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Garcia to investigate allegations of vote-buying in the selection process. He submitted the report in September 2014, which FIFA at the time declined to release in full. Instead, FIFA released a summary that Garcia described as \"materially incomplete,\" leading Garcia to resign in protest. FIFA ultimately published the report in 2017, after German tabloid \"Bild\" announced they would publish a leaked copy. The report detailed dozens of allegations but didn't provide hard evidence for vote-buying. In May 2015, as members gathered in Zürich for the 65th FIFA Congress, U.S. federal prosecutors disclosed cases of corruption leading to the arrest of seven. More than 40 individuals were indicted, including 2018 and 2022 voters Luis Bedoya, Chuck Blazer, Nicolás Leoz, Rafael Salguero, Ricardo Teixeira, and Jack Warner. The resulting cases led FIFA to suspend many members, including Issa Hayatou, and the end of Sepp Blatter's presidency of the organization.\nIn April 2020, the United States Department of Justice unsealed further indictments against voters Nicolás Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira, Julio Grondona of Argentina, and Jack Warner. The indictments spelled out how shell corporations and sham consulting contracts were used to pay voters between $1–5 million for their support. Other voters who had previously pleaded guilty to accepting bribes, including Rafael Salguero of Guatemala, aided in the indictments, which when included with previous cases, mean that more than half of the voters were accused of wrongdoing related to their votes. Voter Franz Beckenbauer has also been accused by Swiss prosecutors of embezzlement and money laundering related to voting in the 2006 FIFA World Cup host selection, while Ángel María Villar was arrested in July 2017 for embezzlement, after previously being fined for failure to cooperate with investigations into vote-buying in the 2018 and 2022 host selection.\nReactions.\nIn reaction to the announcement there were celebrations on the streets of Russia and Qatar. The Qatar Stock Exchange responded strongly with increased participation in trading following the announcement.\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told his Qatari counterpart that hosting the tournament \"is a big athletic event which can promote football in the Persian Gulf area and Middle East region.\" He also said Iran was ready to help Qatar in hosting the event, while saying he hoped its neighbours \"could achieve a reasonable share to attend the games.\" al-Thani \"underlined [a] necessity of cooperation between regional countries to use and take advantage of the sport opportunity.\" He also added that Qatar's initiative would motivate its neighbours to \"promote and develop their football.\"\nRoger Burden, who had been acting chairman of England's Football Association, withdrew his application for the permanent post days after the vote, saying he could not trust FIFA members due to their actions. England's bid executive Andy Anson said \"I think it has to [change] because otherwise why would Australia, the United States, Holland, Belgium, England ever bother bidding again?\"\nThere was also a backlash from the media in the losing countries; the majority of British newspapers alleged that the World Cup had been \"sold\" to Russia, and the Spanish \"El Mundo\", Dutch \"Algemeen Dagblad\", and the Japanese \"Nikkei\" made comments about the financial power of Russia and Qatar's commodity and energy reserves. American newspapers the \"Seattle Times\" and \"Wall Street Journal\" alleged collusion and corruption."

As a point guard, Williams was drafted out of the University of Illinois with the 25th overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets.\nIn 2004, Williams was named to the University of Illinois All-Century Team.\nHigh school career.\nWilliams attended Manual High School in Peoria, Illinois, where he was a member of one of the most heralded teams in the nation. Williams led Peoria Manual to the final two of four consecutive IHSA class AA boys state basketball tournaments, in 1996 as a sophomore and again in 1997 as a junior. In both tournaments, Williams was named to the five-player All-Tournament team. As a senior, Williams was named the 1998 Illinois Mr. Basketball.\nCollege career.\nAfter high school, Williams attended the University of Illinois, and played three seasons for the Fighting Illini under head coach Bill Self, leading the team to a string of NCAA Tournament appearances. After the 2000-2001 season, Williams was named the Big Ten player of the year, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball award. While at Illinois, Williams was re-united with high school teammates Marcus Griffin and Sergio McClain, (a.k.a. \"The Peoria 3\") where they earned a number one seed and eventually went to the Elite 8 in 2001. Williams' high school coach, Wayne McClain (Sergio's father) also was named assistant coach for the Illini during his time there. He was elected to the \"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\" in 2004. In 2007, Williams was voted one of the \"100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament,\" recognizing his superior performance in his appearance in the tournament.\nProfessional career.\nThe New York Knicks acquired Williams in a draft-day trade in 2002 from the Denver Nuggets. He played sparingly in his first season, but found a bit more time on the court during the first half of the 2003-04 season. Unfortunately, new GM Isiah Thomas then traded for star point guard Stephon Marbury, and Williams was relegated back to the end of the bench. The Chicago Bulls acquired him as part of a multi-player trade in the next off-season, where Williams was popular due to his time with the Illini, and expected him to compete with Kirk Hinrich for the starting point guard job, but he showed up to training camp out of shape and spent most of the 2004-05 season on injured reserve. Dissatisfied with his effort, Chicago announced that he would not be re-signed for the next season. Williams signed with the Los Angeles Clippers on October 1, 2005, but was released four days later.\nWilliams' final NBA game was on March 9, 2005, in a 97–84 win over the Portland Trail Blazers where he recorded he recorded no stats in 6 minutes of playing time. Williams played a total of 86 NBA games and averaged 2.9 points and 1.9 assists.\nPersonal.\nOn June 10, 2009, Williams and his younger brother, Aaron, were arrested on drug charges at his Peoria, Illinois home after agents seized 55 grams of marijuana. Frank Williams was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana and unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, and accepted a plea deal of a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge and a $1,000 fine.\nWilliams’ son, Da’Monte Williams, was a guard for the University of Illinois basketball team.

        "text": "Freestyle skateboarding (or freestyle) is one of the oldest styles of skateboarding and was intermittently popular from the 1960s until the early 1990s, when the final large-scale professional freestyle skateboarding competition was held.\nDescription.\nThe emphasis in freestyle is technical flat ground skateboarding. Often a freestyler will need little more than a board and a smooth, flat surface. Music and choreography have always been an essential part of the professional freestyle routine.\nHistory.\n1950s and 1960s.\nFreestyle in the 1950s was created by members of the surfing culture who sought an alternative during times when conditions were not conducive to surfing—surfers would imitate their water-based maneuvers on skateboards when ocean conditions were poor. In the 1960s, many freestyle tricks were derived from gymnastics and dancing.\n1970s and 1980s.\nThe following two decades were defined by a progression towards technical, fluid, and more creative routines. Influential freestyle skateboarders of the 1970s and 1980s included Russ Howell, Rodney Mullen, Joe Humeres and Per Welinder. Freestyle in the 80s was further influenced by female skaters, led by Diane Veerman and Leslie Miller, both of whom competed alongside men in freestyle contests, such as the 1983 NSA Paramount contest In Los Angeles, where Veerman placed 13th out of 31 competitors. Freestyle skating changed significantly in the 1980s, when ollies and ollie-based flip tricks were invented and introduced to the discipline, with Mullen playing a significant role in this process.\nOrganizations.\nCalifornia Amateur Skateboard League (C.A.S.L.) was founded in 1982 by Frank Hawk with the help of two other \"skater parents\", Sonja Catalano and Jeanne Hoffmann. C.A.S.L. is where most of the top professional skateboarders from around the world started competing and is still run today. In 1995, professional freestyle skateboarder Stefan \"Lillis\" Åkesson started the International Network for Flatland Freestyle Skateboarding (INFFS) and, with Daniel Gesmer, produced Flatline and the online version Flatline Online. Following the inception of these initiatives, freestyle skateboarders connected and interacted on a global scale in a manner that had not been experienced previously. The World Freestyle Skateboard Association (WFSA) was then founded by Bob Staton, Åkesson, and Gesmer in the year 2000, thereby attracting further interest in freestyle skateboarding."

        "text": "West Indies A toured Sri Lanka for a cricket tournament between 23 June and 19 July 2005. They played three unofficial four-day \"Tests\" and five unofficial \"ODIs\". The plans for the tour were only confirmed in mid-June as a result of a dispute over sponsorship between the West Indies Cricket Association and its players. The row continued between the Association and the senior West Indian players, though, which led to the Association asking all West Indies A players whether they would make themselves available for the Test tour immediately following the A tour. On 28 June it was announced that they had unanimously declined the request. However, that unanimous agreement vanished in the coming days, and several players were called up from the A squad to the main squad – resulting in the A squad needing more players. Twenty players eventually turned out for the West Indies A squad. Both the first-class and one-day series were alive until the very last match, though. West Indies A took a 57-run victory in the first \"Test\" match, taking the last five wickets of that game for three runs, but crashed to a humbling innings defeat in the second. Sri Lanka A won the series 2–1 thanks to a four-wicket win in the last match. In the one-dayers, West Indies could have forced a drawn series if they had managed to win the last game, but Sri Lanka's bowling undid them and they lost the series 3–1.\nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – First unofficial \"Test\" (23–26 June).\nWest Indies A beat Sri Lanka A by 57 runs\nXavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – both with ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, but there was little resistance after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the second time around, Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were well on their way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.\nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Second unofficial \"Test\" (29 June – 1 July).\nSri Lanka A beat West Indies A by an innings and 16 runs\nSri Lanka A levelled the series with a comprehensive win over West Indies A. However, the main action was happening off the field, as the West Indies Cricket Board's dispute with its senior players over sponsorship issues caused them to drop key players from the Test squad. Only six first-choice players were named in the Test squad, with West Indies A team members Tino Best, Kerry Jeremy, Xavier Marshall, Ryan Ramdass, Runako Morton, Dwayne Smith, Narsingh Deonarine and Jermaine Lawson being named in the side. Controversy surrounds how much pressure the WICB brought to bear on the A team members, but the situation certainly did not help the team concentrate on the game. On the first day of the match, West Indies A batted first, making 253 as only Runako Morton's 114 saved them from humiliation. In reply, Russel Arnold, with 159 was the mainstay of the Sri Lankan innings as they made 417 to establish a lead of 164. Sajeewa Weerakoon then took 6 for 56 as West Indies A capitulated for 148. \nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Third unofficial \"Test\" (7–10 July).\nSri Lanka A beat West Indies A by four wickets\nA new-look West Indies A were close to giving Sri Lanka A a fight, but Sri Lanka A still won the match and the \"Test\" series. Daren Ganga made 109 for West Indies A, lifting them to 324 in total, before Dwayne Washington took three for 31 as Sri Lanka A were all out, twelve runs behind. However, the match was running out of time, and West Indies A did not seem all that keen on trying to win it. After wicket-keeper Lendl Simmons departed for 52, a total of 104 runs were hit in 55 overs – Darren Sammy making 40 not out off 166 balls. Yet, a marathon bowling effort from left-arm spinner Sajeewa Weerakoon yielded six wickets for 57 runs, and West Indies A were all out for 205 – setting a target of 218 with around 40 overs remaining. Sri Lanka A went for it positively, hitting at nearly exactly a run a ball, with Avishka Gunawardene top scoring with 49. Despite three quick wickets from Sammy to reduce Sri Lanka A to 186 for 6, that was as close as the Caribbean tourists got, as Dilhara Lokuhettige made 22 not out and guided the hosts to the target.\nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – First unofficial \"ODI\" (13 July).\nSri Lanka A tied with West Indies A (D/L method)\nAn entertaining one-day game between the two sides ended in a tie – West Indies A reaching the Duckworth/Lewis target. Earlier, Sri Lanka A had enlisted the help of Saman Jayantha who made 73, while off-spinner Dave Mohammed took four for 44. A revised target of 201 in 41 overs looked tricky for the West Indies, as Dilhara Loku Hettige took three early wickets and with some help had the tourists tied down on 99 for 6, but Carlton Baugh and Mohammed rescued them to 200 for 6 after 41 overs. \nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Second unofficial \"ODI\" (14 July).\nSri Lanka A beat West Indies A by 15 runs (D/L method)\nMarlon Samuels (100) and David Bernard (66) were the mainstays of the West Indian innings after they were put into bat by Sri Lanka. The West Indians scored well, making their way to 273 for 9 off their 50 overs. Whilst Sri Lanka lost the occasional wicket, they were able to put on partnerships of 31, 41, 51 and 9 before Arnold and Jayawardene got together. 102 runs later the partnership was broken and Sri Lanka moved to 243 for 5 when rain brought an end to the match after 44 overs. This left the hosts comfortable winners on the Duckworth–Lewis method. \nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Third unofficial \"ODI\" (16 July).\nSri Lanka A beat West Indies A by seven wickets\nThe West Indians were put into bat at Moratuwa as rain reduced the match to a 35-over-a-side affair. West Indies A started strongly, reaching 71 for 1 before wickets started to tumble when Chattergoon (38) fell. Ganga (52), who came in first wicket down, anchored the innings, and was eighth man out. But no-one was able to stay with him for long as the West Indies were all out for 168 with 19 balls still to go. Sri Lanka encountered few difficulties in reaching their target, which they did with eleven balls and seven wickets spare. However, they did have an early wobble as Gunawardene, Jayantha and Kalavitagoda were all out with the score still on 39. Then Tharanga (74*) and Arnold (39*) saw the hosts home to a result that means Sri Lanka cannot lose the series. \nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Fourth unofficial \"ODI\" (18 July).\nWest Indies A beat Sri Lanka A by eight wickets\nThe tourists pegged Sri Lanka A back to 1–2 in the series after bowling them out for 164 and then batting well to get to the total. Richard Kelly and Darren Sammy took four early wickets as Sri Lanka went from 20 for 0 to 26 for 4, and after Arnold and Jayawardene rebuilt, Lendl Simmons and David Bernard grabbed a wicket each to set Sri Lanka A further back. Kelly took a further two wickets to finish with four for 38, and Sri Lanka A finished on 164 all out. Lendl Simmons then cracked the highest score of the day by far, making 97 off 102 balls, and West Indies A took a comprehensive eight-wicket win. \nSri Lanka A v West Indies A – Fifth unofficial \"ODI\" (19 July).\nSri Lanka A beat West Indies A by 72 runs\nSri Lanka A secured the series thanks to 69 not out from Russel Arnold who hit runs quickly on a difficult pitch at Nondescripts Cricket Club Ground. He was well helped by Jayawardene, as the pair took plenty of runs off Darren Sammy and Dwight Washington. Despite four for 23 from spinner Dave Mohammed, Sri Lanka A made 227, and all their bowlers proceeded to take wickets as West Indies rolled over for 155. Dave Mohammed was the star with the bat as well, making 43, while Dave Bernard recorded a frustrating 12 off 41 balls."

        "text": "The Skeleton Canyon treasure is said to be located in the Peloncillo Mountains within Skeleton Canyon. The canyon straddles the modern Arizona and New Mexico state line border and connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico, (the New Mexico Bootheel region), with the San Simon Valley of Arizona. An alleged treasure tale, involving a Mexican gang in a sack of Monterrey, Mexico and buried in southeastern Arizona's Skeleton Canyon in the summer and fall of 1881.\nAccording to extant stories, a Mexican gang led by Jose Estrada had sacked several banks and cathedrals in Monterrey, taking a large amount of gold and silver bullion, gold statuary, and diamonds. Some stories indicate the items taken include 39 gold bars and a cigarbox full of diamonds. This gang then made their way northwest, towards Arizona, where they were ambushed by American outlaws in the Peloncillo Mountains as they made their way through Skeleton Canyon towards the Animas Valley of New Mexico. Having killed off the Mexican outlaws, the American outlaws supposedly buried the treasure there, and made their way out of the canyon, only to die off one by one in a series of later double-crosses. The treasure remains unrecovered.\nIn treasure hunting there are always true stories, false ones, and those built up from minor events. Skeleton Canyon is of the latter. Between the late 1870s and early 1880s the Clanton Gang operated in that part of Arizona. Their modus operandi was to rustle cattle and sell the stock to the mining towns which sprang up during that time. Their victims included Mexicans, some of whom were involved in legitimate cattle drives, as well as those engaged in the illegal smuggling of various goods. The canyons along the western side of the Pelloncillos were favored as ambush sites, and it is documented that at least four such ambush/robberies took place. On 13 August 1881, in retaliation for one such ambush, Neuman Haynes Clanton was gunned down in the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre.\nThe ambush and robberies in those canyons may have netted the outlaws a small fortune, possibly a few thousand dollars at most, which then grew into the Skeleton Canyon tales today. The large amount that is stated in the tales never existed; a check of newspapers and government sources within Mexico and the U.S. states bordering the area revealed that the source of the treasure, Monterrey, was never sacked and robbed at any time.\nThe legend was dramatized on a 1990 episode of Unsolved Mysteries."

        "text": "Shinnecock Hills Golf Club is a links-style golf club located in an unincorporated area of the Town of Southampton on Long Island, New York, situated between the Peconic Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.\nShinnecock Hills is believed to be the oldest incorporated golf club in the United States (1891), to have the oldest golf clubhouse in the U.S. (1892), and to have been the first American golf club to admit women members, which it did from the start. It is also the only golf course to host the U.S. Open in three different centuries.\nShinnecock Hills is a founding member of the United States Golf Association. It has hosted several important events, notably five U.S. Opens, most recently being the 2018 event won by Brooks Koepka. It is scheduled to host a sixth in 2026. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places \nIt is routinely ranked as one of the greatest golf courses in the world.\nHistory.\nThe club traces its roots to an 1889–1890 trip by William K. Vanderbilt, Edward Meade, and Duncan Cryder, to Biarritz in southern France where they encountered champion golfer Willie Dunn, from Scotland, who was building a golf course at \nBack in the United States, Meade and Cryder scouted for a place for a golf course near New York City. Meade, known for his cowboy-ish antics trading commodities, was convinced that upstate New York would be the ideal location, but Cryder preferred a parcel of land in Yonkers. Ultimately, they chose the sandhills adjoining the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Shinnecock Canal. The original parcel was purchased from developers for $2,500 and 44 original members signed up for $100 each.\nWillie Davis, the club professional from the Royal Montreal Club, designed a 12-hole course that opened in late summer 1891. Members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation helped build the course, which sits on the large expanse of land the Nation claims was illegally taken from them by earlier settlers of the area in 1859. At the 2018 U.S. Open, members of the Nation protested the event, noting that several burial sites were desecrated during the courses' construction. Stanford White designed the 1892 clubhouse, said to be the oldest golf clubhouse in the United States. A nine-hole ladies-only course was designed and built at Shinnecock Hills in 1893, the first ladies’ golf course in American history.\nIn 1894, Dunn arrived and added six more holes bringing the total to 18. That same year Dunn won the tournament which was an inaugural attempt to establish a national championship at Newport, Rhode Island, but this victory was not recognized as official. Later in 1894, Shinnecock Hills was one of five founding clubs of the United States Golf Association, established in New York City. The new USGA held the first U.S. Open in 1895 in Newport, Rhode Island.\nIn 1896 the then– Shinnecock hosted the second U.S. Open. Many players broke 80 in the 36-hole event, which led to demands to increase the course's difficulty. Participating in the 1896 Open was black professional player John Shippen, believed by many historians to have been the first USA-born golf professional.\nIn 1901 the ladies' course was incorporated into a lengthened and redesigned course by Charles B. Macdonald and Seth Raynor, retaining five of Dunn's original holes.\nWilliam Flynn extensively redesigned the course in 1931 into a configuration. Flynn's design retains five of the holes by Macdonald and Raynor, and the green of a sixth hole designed by those two. Prior to the 2004 U.S. Open, the course was extended to a length of by the addition of extra tees.\nShinnecock Hills was ranked second in \"Golf Digest\"s 100 Greatest Courses Ranking for 2007, 2008, and third in 2009.\nIts routing was retained, and several new tees were added, in preparation for the 2018 U.S. Open; the course was extended to 7,440 yards, retaining its par of 70. Shinnecock Hills is scheduled to host the 2026 U.S. Open.\nThe club also maintains a nine-hole secondary course for use by its members."

He played representative level rugby league (RL) for the Scotland national rugby league team, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, and representative level rugby union (RU) for the Scotland national rugby union team, as a centre, and for Glasgow Warriors and Caledonia Reds.\nHe was the first player to be capped by Scotland in a Rugby League international before representing in a Rugby Union international.\nBackground.\nMcLaren was born in Stirling, Scotland.\nClub career.\nRugby League.\nMcLaren played rugby league in Australia for the Canberra Raiders, before returning to his hometown of Stirling to play rugby union for Stirling County. While with Stirling he was called up to the provincial rugby union sides Glasgow Warriors and Caledonia Reds.\nWhilst playing for Stirling against Melrose, McLaren was given a 26-week ban by the Scottish Rugby Union for being found to have kicked Craig Chalmers in the head, in a ruck. Stirling County had claimed that slow-motion video evidence proved that while Chalmers had, indeed, been kicked, the act had not been deliberate. The SRU stated that it was their intent for a 26-week ban for kicking to the head to be mandatory. At the rugby union ban, McLaren once again took up rugby league.\nAt the time rugby league had switched to a summer sport in Britain. McLaren signed for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in 1997. Serving out his rugby union ban in rugby league, he returned to Glasgow Warriors for the start of the 1997–98 season.\nRugby Union.\nHe was named as a replacement in Glasgow's European Conference match at home to Agen on 30 October 1996. He also played in Glasgow's pre-season match against London Scottish coming off the bench to replace Alan Bulloch on 10 August 1997.\nHowever he also played for Caledonia Reds late in season 1997–98.\nWhen Caledonia Reds folded at the end of season 1997–98, McLaren was earmarked to return to Glasgow Warriors. However instead he went to France playing for Bourgoin.\nTwo years later, in 2000, McLaren did sign back with Glasgow Warriors.\nHe stayed in Glasgow another two years before returning to France, to play for Begles-Bordeaux, and then Bayonne.\nInternational honours.\nRugby League.\nMcLaren won a cap for Scotland in rugby league while at the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in the 20–22 defeat by France in Glasgow on 9 July 1997.\nRugby Union.\nHis international rugby union début for the Scotland national rugby union team came against Argentina in 1999.

        "text": "Christopher Bob Shelton (born June 26, 1980) is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, and Seattle Mariners over his 5-year major league career. Shelton is a cousin of former NFL quarterback Alex Smith.\nAmateur career.\nBefore entering professional baseball, he played at Cottonwood High School, Salt Lake Community College, and the University of Utah. While playing with Utah, Shelton was named to the Mountain West Conference All-Tournament Team as a junior.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Tigers.\nShelton was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 33rd round, although he never made the team's 40-man roster. Unprotected, he was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the Rule 5 draft. In 2004, he played sparingly because the Tigers had to keep him on their roster because of the Rule 5 rules. He only batted 57 times.\nWhile in Detroit, due to his red hair and prodigious batting, he had earned various nicknames, such as \"Red Pop\" (a reference to the Detroit-made Faygo beverage) from the Tiger faithful. Tigers play-by-play commentators Rod Allen and Mario Impemba often called him \"Big Red\" or \"Orange Crush.\"\nOn April 15, 2004, Shelton made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers as a pinch hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays. He went hitless in two at-bats as Roy Halladay pitched a complete game shutout against the Tigers.\nIn , Shelton hit nine home runs in the first 13 games of the season; this made him the fastest player in American League history to reach that mark at that point in a season. He also became the fourth player in baseball history to hit at least nine home runs in his team's first 13 games; he trails only Mike Schmidt in , Larry Walker in , and Luis Gonzalez in in that regard. He earned the American League Player of the Week accolade for April 3, 2006. Shelton's power dropped significantly after April, however, and on July 31, 2006, he was optioned to Triple-A Toledo to make room for Sean Casey, whom the Tigers had acquired from Pittsburgh in a trade-deadline deal. On September 1, Shelton was recalled back to Detroit as an emergency catcher for Iván Rodríguez.\nDuring spring training, Shelton started and finished spring training with the Tigers and by the end of spring training there was one spot left on the team's roster and the fight was between Marcus Thames and Chris Shelton. Shelton did not make the roster, which left him heading to Toledo for the 2007 season.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn December 5, 2007, Shelton was traded to the Texas Rangers for Freddy Guzmán, and on January 14, , designated for assignment in order to make room for Kazuo Fukumori, a veteran reliever from the Japanese leagues. His contract was then purchased on April 29, 2008, from the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks, again by the Texas Rangers, when Jason Botts was designated for assignment. On June 26, 2008, the strikeout prone Shelton was designated for assignment to make way for Chris Davis. He cleared waivers, and was reassigned once more to the RedHawks. Shelton became a free agent at the end of the season.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn December 8, 2008, Shelton signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He batted .460 during 2009 spring training (.534 OBP, .720 SLG), second on the team among players with at least 30 at-bats, but did not break camp with the major-league club. On July 10, 2009, the Seattle Mariners called up Shelton to add more pop on the bench, and he came through with the game-winning run in a Mariners victory just two days later. Shelton was designated for assignment by the Mariners on August 1, 2009. His contract was then purchased on August 5, 2009, from the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. He was granted free agency on October 15, 2009.\nHouston Astros.\nShelton signed a minor league contract on December 8, 2009 with Houston Astros\nNew York Mets.\nShelton became a free agent after the 2010 season. On February 20, 2011, he signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets for the 2011 season.\nShelton was released before the season began at Triple A for the New York Mets minor league team."

        "title": "Kelly Johnson (baseball)",
        "text": "Kelly Andrew Johnson (born February 22, 1982) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Mets. While primarily a second baseman, Johnson has appeared at every position except for pitcher, catcher, and center field during his career. Johnson was the first player to appear in a game for all five American League East teams; Steve Pearce became the second in 2018. He was on the New York Mets' postseason roster in 2015, where he appeared in his first World Series.\nProfessional career.\nAtlanta Braves.\nJohnson was drafted in the first round (38th overall) of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves. Johnson decided to forego a scholarship offer to play college baseball at Texas A&amp;M in favor of signing with the Braves. Johnson made his Major League debut with the Braves on May 29, 2005, and became a regular outfielder, due to the many injuries that plagued the Braves early in the 2005 season. Johnson was named the National League Player of the Week for the week of June 13 after batting .417 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in 24 at-bats.\nAn elbow injury sidelined Johnson for the entire 2006 season. He was placed on the disabled list during spring training after experiencing pain while making throws from the outfield, and had Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews on June 1. During the offseason, Johnson spent many hours with Braves first base coach Glenn Hubbard at Turner Field to learn how to play second base effectively. Johnson earned the starting position at second base and as the leadoff hitter for the Braves for the 2007 season. On April 8, 2007, Johnson hit the first leadoff homer of his career in a 3–2 win against the New York Mets. In late June, Johnson lost his position as the leadoff hitter in the Braves lineup. In the 48 games Johnson played in May and June, his on-base percentage was .325, well below the acceptable rate for a good leadoff hitter. Willie Harris, who took over the role as primary leadoff hitter, had an on-base percentage of .440 prior to June 22 (Johnson's last game as the leadoff hitter), prompting Braves manager Bobby Cox to make the change. (As of August 10, Johnson had an on-base percentage of .419 since June 22.) In addition to being demoted from the top of the order, Johnson's offensive struggles motivated Cox to move Johnson into a platoon at second base with Yunel Escobar. He capped off his year with 16 homers and a .276 batting average.\nWith Escobar taking over full-time at shortstop, Johnson began the year as the Braves second baseman for the 2008 season. Johnson had the longest hitting streak in the National League of the 2008 season, hitting in 22-straight games. He hit .398 with 19 RBIs in 25 games in September. Johnson ended the 2008 season with a .287 batting average, 12 homers, 69 RBIs, 86 runs, and 11 stolen bases.\nIn 2009, Johnson lost his full-time starting position with the Braves. He increased his contact rate on pitches inside the strike zone, as well as swinging at more pitches outside the strike zone. This pattern is associated with a less-aggressive swing and was associated with his poor results in 2009.\nOn December 12, 2009, Johnson, was non-tendered by the Atlanta Braves making him a free agent.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn December 30, 2009, Johnson signed a one-year, $2.35 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Arizona had previously shown interest in acquiring Johnson from the Braves. Johnson said this about his new team,\nHe received the Player of the Month award for the month of April, his first month as a player for the Diamondbacks. He earned the award by hitting nine home runs and a .750 slugging percentage. In his first 22 games, Johnson batted .313 (25-80) with 18 RBI, 17 runs scored and a .404 OBP.\nOn July 23, 2010, Johnson successfully hit for the cycle against the San Francisco Giants. Johnson hit a solo home run in the first, a ground-rule double in the fifth, a two-run triple in the sixth and completed it with a single in the eighth. Johnson tied the game at 1 with his home run, almost tied the game with a double but it was a ground-rule so Young was held at third base, tied the game at 3 with a 2-run triple, and represented the tying run with his single.\nOn May 21, 2011, Johnson launched a pitch from Minnesota Twins closer Matt Capps deep into the right-field bleachers at Chase Field for a grand slam that capped the Diamondbacks rally from down 6-3 and made the score 9–6, which would be the final score.\nOn July 8, 2011, Johnson hit his second grand slam in the season off St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Kyle Lohse. Johnson gave the D-backs the lead in the seventh to break a tie 7–3. He hit a 2-2 pitch into the Cardinals bullpen while thinking that he only hit a sacrifice fly. The ball carried long enough to be a grand slam.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn August 23, 2011, Johnson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for second baseman Aaron Hill and shortstop John McDonald. Johnson was set to debut for the Blue Jays on August 24, but had to return to Arizona because he forgot his passport. He made his debut instead on August 25, and went 1 for 2 with 2 walks and a run scored.\nJohnson hit his 100th career home run on May 16, 2012.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nIn January 2013, the Rays agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.45 million with Johnson. The contract became official on February 5, 2013. Johnson was the Rays Opening Day designated hitter, and throughout the year, he played there, left field, second base, third base, and 3 games at first base. Johnson got 50 starts in left field (the most on the team), splitting time with Matt Joyce and Sean Rodriguez. When he didn't start in left field, he would either come in off the bench, or get a start as a backup at one of the other positions. In 91 at-bats in May, he hit .330 with 7 HR and 26 RBI, and he hit .333 with 4 HR and 9 RBI in July, his only two above-average months. In 118 games in 2013, he hit .235 with 16 HR and 52 RBI. He experienced a severe drop in walks (27 less than 2012) and strikeouts (60 less than 2012), but he also played in 24 fewer games.\nNew York Yankees.\nIn December 2013, Johnson signed a one-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $3 million. In late July, Johnson suffered a groin injury that placed him on the 15-day DL. Johnson was mostly used as a reserve corner infielder with the Yankees, making 56 starts at the two positions. In 77 games with New York, he hit .219/.304/.373 with 6 HR and 22 RBI.\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe Yankees traded Johnson to the Boston Red Sox for Stephen Drew on July 31, 2014, which was the first trade between the rival teams since 1997. This trade also reunited Johnson with former Blue Jays manager John Farrell. Johnson played in just 10 games with the Red Sox, hitting 4-25 (.160) with a double and 1 RBI.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nThe Red Sox traded Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles, along with Michael Almanzar, for Ivan De Jesus Jr. and Jemile Weeks on August 30, 2014. He is the first player to play for every AL East team since MLB switched to six divisions in 1994.\nReturn to Atlanta Braves.\nOn January 21, 2015, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. The deal included an invitation to spring training. On April 4, the team announced that Johnson had made the Opening Day\nroster. Through his first 28 games with the Braves, Johnson spent most of his playing time at third base and left field. On May 14, 2015, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, an oblique injury forced Johnson to leave the game after just two pitches in his first and only at bat. He had led the team in home runs at the time with six. He was placed on the DL and remained there until June 10, 2015. After everyday first baseman Freddie Freeman suffered a wrist injury, Johnson often split time at first base with Chris Johnson and Joey Terdoslavich, in addition to playing left field and occasionally at third base.\nNew York Mets.\nOn July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Johnson and third baseman Juan Uribe, along with cash considerations, to the New York Mets for minor-league pitchers John Gant and Rob Whalen. In his first game as a Met, he hit a single, a double, and a home run in a 15–2 victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With the Mets, Johnson made his first major-league appearance at shortstop.\nThird stint with the Atlanta Braves.\nOn January 8, 2016, Johnson again returned to the Braves, signing a one-year deal worth $2 million.\nSecond stint with the New York Mets.\nOn June 8, 2016, the Braves traded Johnson to the Mets for minor league pitcher Akeel Morris.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson is married to Lauren, with whom he has four children.\nIn the summer of 2018, Johnson was among the former MLB players who appeared with the Louisville Stars, a tournament team at the Bluegrass World Series."

        "title": "Basketball moves",
        "text": "Basketball moves are generally individual actions used by players in basketball to pass by defenders to gain access to the basket or to get a pass to a teammate to score.\nDribble.\nDribbling is bouncing the ball continuously with one hand at a time without holding the ball. Dribbling is necessary in order to take steps while possessing the ball.\nCrossover.\nIn a crossover, the ball handler changes the ball from one hand to the other using a single dribble. The crossover is a common dribbling move and is used when changing direction. A crossover functions best when the ball handler looks and acts like they are headed in one direction, before crossing over to the other direction. This can often be achieved by a simple head fake, or a step in that intended direction. \nBetween the legs.\nThis is a commonly used variation of the crossover in which the ball-handler bounces the ball off of the floor between their legs and catches it with the other hand on the opposite side of their body. It is used as a safer way to cross over while directly facing a defender, but requires more slowing of forward momentum than the normal crossover dribble.\nBehind-the-back dribble.\nThe behind-the-back dribble consists of moving the ball from one hand to the other hand by bouncing it behind one's back. This dribble is frequently used when a basic crossover dribble could be stolen. \nThis dribble is an especially useful when the offensive player is close to a defender and needs to switch the ball to the opposite hand, but does not have room to use a regular crossover.\nBehind-the-back pass.\nAn advanced pass involving the player with the basketball passing to a teammate by wrapping the ball behind their body.\nBehind-the-back shot.\nA shot which the ball is passed behind the back to one hand then shot.\nWraparound.\nThe wraparound is similar to a behind-the-back crossover, except instead of the ball being thrown in a sideways direction and bouncing behind the ball handler's back, it is swung further around the back and thrown in a forward direction, bouncing on the side or in front of the ball handler's body. This move is mostly used when a defender lunges toward one side of the ball handler's body for a steal. The ball handler would then simply throw the ball around their body and quickly pass their defender.\nHesitation.\nA hesitation or hesi ( ) is a split-second freeze while dribbling meant to trick the defender into changing direction to give the dribbler a chance to move around the defender or take a shot.\nIn and out dribble.\nAn in and out dribble is widely used as a counter move to a crossover, whereby the ball handler fakes the crossover and pushes the ball back out on the same hand.\nV dribble.\nBall is dribbled with same hand in a V motion. Almost looks like a double crossover but ball stays in hand.\nDifferent heights dribble.\nThis technique involves dribbling the ball in different heights. This is usually combined with other dribbling techniques to make it more effective. It is mostly effective on players smaller or taller than the dribbler but not quite as much on players that are the same height as the dribbler. If you are facing a shorter opponent, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball low and then suddenly turning the ball very high. If the opponent is taller than you, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball high and quickly lowering the height of the dribble. If your opponent does not bite on your lure/trap, maintain the height of your dribble, and you can drive past them with more speed. If you're going to pass or shoot after your dribble, make sure that you will go back to your usual pace to maintain the momentum for your dribbling.\nAnkle breaker dribble.\nThis is when an offensive player does a move that makes their defender stumble to the ground. Players collapsing due to this rarely occurs under normal circumstances. Typically this happens when a defender loses balance, trips over their own feet, or even slips. An offensive player can't consistently control whether the defender falls, but using speed, body momentum, body contact and sharp changes of direction make it much more likely to happen. This move usually embarrasses the defender.\nAfter the dribble.\nEuro step.\nThe Euro step (sometimes \"Eurostep\") is a move developed in European basketball in which a player, after picking up their dribble, takes a step in one direction bumping into their defender, and then quickly takes a second step in the other direction before they attempt a layup. It is an attempt to evade at least one defender before attacking the basket.\nŠarūnas Marčiulionis, a Lithuanian, and Manu Ginóbili, an Argentine who arrived in the NBA from the Italian league, are credited with bringing the move to the NBA. It has since been widely used by many US-born players, such as Dwyane Wade, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook.\nJump stop.\nIn a jump stop, the player takes one small step and lands on both feet simultaneously. It can be used after a dribble. A player who receives a pass with a jump stop can pivot after the stop using either foot.\nPro-Hop.\nThe combination of a euro step and a jump-stop, the pro-hop is a move in which a player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a synchronized left hand dribble with left foot step. The player then rips the ball to the opposite side of their body while landing on a jump-stop. The pro hop's ability to split defenders, or throw an opposing defender off rhythm through 'change of direction speed' is a move popularized by Shantay Legans, former point guard for University of California at Berkeley.\nPro-hop euro step.\nThe Pro-hop Euro Step combines the pro-hop and Euro step while removing the pro-hop's jump stop. The player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a left hand dribble with left foot step. Player then rips the ball to opposite side of their body (behind the back if skilled), takes two steps, and finishes with a reverse layup.\nPower up.\nThe power up is a move in which the player lands on their outside foot then inside foot, and powers up toward the basket. An effective move because of its balance and power resulting from a two-foot gather and take off.\nOver-the-head.\nThe over-the-head move is a move in which the player rotates the ball over their head in a circular fashion. This is done as the player is stepping to one side of the defender, while trying to get past them at the same time. It is essentially used as a way to prevent the ball from getting stolen. It is typically used when driving to the basket, and on fast breaks.\nShots.\nLayups.\nA layup is a two-point attempt made by leaping from the ground, releasing the ball with one hand up near the basket, and using one hand to tip the ball over the rim and into the basket (lay-in) or banking it off the backboard and into the basket (lay-up). The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball.\nAn undefended layup is usually a high-percentage shot. The main challenge is getting near the rim and avoiding blocks by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create space, releasing the ball from different spots or using an alternate hand. A player tall enough (or with sufficient leaping ability) to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage slam dunk (dropping or throwing the ball through the basket from above the rim) instead.\nAs the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are used today. Layups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the basket or off the board. The underarm layup is more commonly known as the finger roll. A notable NBA player who uses the underarm finger roll is Dwyane Wade.\nFinger-rolls today have many forms, including the Around the World which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by former Kings point guard Jason Williams during his time with Sacramento, in which Williams brings the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brings it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of Bob Cousy who pioneered the move).\nThe other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from considerably closer range. Overhand layups almost always involved the use of the backboard. Players like Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone have used this move to great effect.\nIn addition, another variation of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move can be seen by inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming their block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand, and vice versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily on the wrong footed layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.\nReverse layup.\nA reverse layup is a layup that is finished on the opposite side of the court's split-line than the player began the attack on.\nFinger roll.\nA finger roll is performed when a player shoots the ball with one hand during a layup and then lifts their fingers, rolling the ball into the basket. The rotation produced provides the ball with a soft touch, and the ball will roll around the rim and then drop into the basket. Guard George \"The Iceman\" Gervin and center Wilt Chamberlain were known for having some of the best finger rolls in the game. Other notable practitioners have included Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Jason Kidd.\nTear drop.\nThe tear drop, also called a runner or a floater, is a high arcing shot over the reach of taller defenders in the lane. The shooter typically begins with a layup drive, stops short of layup range, and attempts to shoot before defenders can recover. By releasing the ball quickly and in a higher arc than a normal layup, the tear drop can be effective for shorter players to avoid blocked shots. It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling tear drop. Gary Payton and John Stockton during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game. Chris Paul, Tony Parker, and Stephen Curry frequently use the tear drop with great success. Antawn Jamison had one of the most highly effective tear drop shots in the league despite being a power forward. Trae Young and Anfernee Simons are both currently known for the tear drop move.\nPower layup.\nPower layup, also called jump stop layup, is a continuous shooting move in which a player stops dribbling and makes a huge leap forward (jump stop), while securing the ball in both hands from the dribbling hand, then making a layup. The move is generally used as a layup because the huge movement coming from the leap provides the momentum for the player to jump forward for a layup. The move is a great way to squeeze the player under the basket for a fast layup.\nDouble clutch.\nA double clutch is a move associated with a layup or a dunk; it is a change of ball position in mid-air (similar to the \"up and under\" move, but performed while the player is in the air). It is effectively used by many players.\nBank shot.\nA \"bank shot\" is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off the backboard and into the basket. It is frequently used for mid-range jump shots from around a 45° angle and layups. It is not commonly used for long-range shots or shots from the middle or near the baseline. The purpose of using the backboard is to try to hit the backboard at an angle, thus slowing the speed of the ball and increasing its chances of falling into the hoop. Researchers at North Carolina State University found that bank shots may be 20 percent more effective up to a distance of about 12 feet than direct shots. Another term for a bank shot is \"off the glass.\" Among the NBA players known for using or having used the bank shot often are Bob Pettit, Sam Jones, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, George Gervin, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Scottie Pippen, and Kobe Bryant.\nPutback and tip-in.\nA putback describes a situation where a player secures an offensive rebound, then immediately scores a basket. If the player secures the rebound while in the air, for the shot to be considered a putback, the player can land on the ground before shooting, but cannot dribble before taking the shot. If the player does not secure the rebound but instead taps the ball into the basket, it is considered a tip-in. There is a point where the difference between a putback and a tip-in is subjective (e.g., a one-handed rebound in the air followed by a shot before touching the ground). A putback jam is a spectacular alternative to the tip-in, where the ball is slam-dunked off the rebound in the same motion. Bill Russell would use this move during his college days in the mid-1950s Josh Smith and Kenyon Martin are more recent users of the putback jam. It is also a primary source of scoring for All-Star center Dwight Howard, who led the NBA in dunks in the 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons.\nTriple threat position and related moves.\n\"Triple threat\" is the position when a player facing a defender receives a pass but has not dribbled yet. The offensive player's feet are slightly wider than shoulder width and slightly on the balls of their feet, their knees flexed, with both hands on the basketball in front of them or almost resting on their thigh, presenting the defender with an opponent able to move in any direction. One foot is held as the pivot and the other slightly ahead. From this, the player can choose from three options: to jump-shoot, to dribble (drive) past the defender or to pass it to a teammate. There are also options to get the defender out of their defensive stance by using jab steps and pump fakes.\nPivot.\nPivoting is the act of rotating one's body while keeping the ball of one foot in place on the floor. Most of the player's balance should be on the pivot foot while slightly raising the heel in order to pivot on the ball of the foot. Pivoting can be done with or without the ball as it is an important tool to quickly change direction or orientation to the basket.\nJab step.\nA jab step, also known as \"side step,\" is performed when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while their non-pivot leg performs a jabbing forward or side motion. This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance. A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of their defense. Forward Carmelo Anthony is well known for taking the jab step, as was 13-year pro Kiki Vandeweghe. When the player does this, the defender falls off from their defensive stance, creating a space between the player and the defender, allowing them to take a quick mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, or a drive \"to the lane.\"\nPump fake.\nA pump fake (also called a shot fake) is a feigned attempt at a jump shot, restrained before the feet leave the ground. The pump fake is a fundamental move in basketball, used to cause defenders to jump (known in basketball slang as \"lifting\" the defender) or be shifted off-balance. Its main applications are in the low post area, where a player is much more likely to have their shot blocked. On the perimeter, it is useful in creating open lanes to the basket by \"showing\" the ball enough to entice a defender to attempt to block or steal it, allowing the dribbler to penetrate easily. Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Paul Pierce, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade are known masters of the pump fake, with Leonard and Jordan being known to frequently use the one hand pump fake variation.\nDrawing contact.\nAn offensive move intended to produce a foul call on the defensive player. A typical strategy is to drive into a defensive player whose feet are not stationary. When the two players make bodily contact, a blocking foul can be called on the defensive player. If the defensive player has a set position (i.e., both feet are stationary and arms are not in a downward motion), the contact can result in a charging foul against the offensive player (this is known as \"taking the charge\" for the fouled defensive player). Another way of drawing contact is to pump fake and then jump towards the defender, make contact and then shoot; this gets you to the foul line. If you make the basket (often made in the paint), you get the basket and one foul shot. Players like DeMar DeRozan, Paul Pierce, James Harden, Kobe Bryant, Damian Lillard, and Dwyane Wade have mastered the art of drawing contact.\nShuffle.\nThis move is similar to the jab step, but smaller. It is when a player uses multiple very little jab steps to throw off a defender and keep them constantly guessing whether you will go to the basket or not. It was used frequently by former San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan.\nPosting up.\nTo \"post up\" is to establish a position in the low post, the area near the basket below the foul line, usually in order to take advantage of a smaller defender. The offensive player usually faces away from the basket, so that their body can protect the ball from being stolen by the defender. From this position, options such as spinning or backing down the defender (to close-in on the basket, for easier scoring opportunities) then becomes available.\nUp and under.\nThe up and under is a move consisting of two parts: a shot fake (the up) and a step-through (the under). First the player with the ball fakes a shot by thrusting the ball above their head as if to take a shot, then when the defender jumps in an attempt to block the shot, the offensive player steps by them and attempts a clear, unguarded shot.\nGenerally used by post players (power forwards and centers), Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin McHale were considered masters of this move.\nHook shot.\nThe hook shot is one of the most effective inside moves, but it is also quite difficult to execute. A hook shot begins when the player puts their body between the ball and the opponent. They then release the ball towards the basket with their outside hand in a \"hook\" motion. The hook shot and variations such as the jump-hook and skyhook are effective because they are very difficult for the defender to block, although it is harder to hit the shot with precision. The advantage the hook shot offers is the space it creates between the offensive player and their defender. This extra space can reduce or eliminate the advantages enjoyed by a taller defender. The hook shot is most often used by post players because it is difficult to make the shot from a distance. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the NBA's 2nd all-time leading scorer by using his almost indefensible skyhook.\nDrop step.\nAlso called a \"reverse pivot\", the drop step is a move in which the player posting up takes a back step on the side of a defender behind them and spins to that side to gain leverage.\nPower move.\nThe power move is executed by pivoting towards the basket to seal the defender, then using a two handed power dribble followed by a jump stop to get closer to the basket. Immediately after the jump stop the player jumps up for a power shot or jump hook.\nSpin and drive.\nWhen the offensive player receives the ball in the low post, the player either fakes in one direction and then spins in the opposite direction, or immediately after catching the ball, the player spins around the defender and goes up for the shot or takes one hard dribble and then takes the shot.\nSikma move.\nNamed after Jack Sikma, the post player receives the ball with their back to the basket and keeps the ball at forehead level. The post then pivots to face the basket while bringing the ball overhead (almost behind the head) to shoot a jump shot. The ball is released high over the head making it difficult for the defense to block.\nDream shake.\nNamed after Hakeem \"The Dream\" Olajuwon, this move is executed when a post player dribbles alongside the baseline and with one hand under the ball fakes a layup, then pivots to the outside for a jump hook. If the defender recovers and jumps at the hook shot, the post player can pump fake the hook and step through for the unguarded layup (similar to the up and under move).\nShooting.\nPull-up jumper.\nA pull-up jumper is an offensive move, where the ball handler in the act of dribbling, 'pulls up' to shoot the basketball. This is especially effective as the defender is not able to react in time to affect or block the shot. This move is widely used by many players in the NBA, including notable stars such as Jerry West, Tracy McGrady, DeMar DeRozan, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James.\nTurnaround jump shot.\nWhen a player posts up, in order to shoot they have to turn around to face the basket. This can be done by turning in the air, timing the jump shot when the defender is not likely to jump and challenge the shot. Though a fade-away version of this move was perfected by Larry Bird and Dirk Nowitzki, players such as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Elgin Baylor, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Kevin Garnett are also well known for it.\nFadeaway.\nA fadeaway shot is a variation on a set jump shot in which the shooter attempts their shot leaning backward, creating the effect of \"fading away\" from their defender. This makes it more difficult for the defender to contest the shot. The fadeaway usually has less range than a regular jump shot, because the ball has backwards momentum due to its inertia, making it somewhat tougher to project the ball over long distances. Also you have to kick one leg forward because if you leave both feet pointing down while fading away you might lose balance in shooting the ball or bend your upper body to the side after the shot. Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, Steve Nash, and DeMar DeRozan are famous for their use of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain was criticized for his frequent use of the fadeaway jumper, since the follow-through usually carries the shooter away from the basket and out of rebounding position.\nStep-back jump shot.\nThe shooter takes a quick jab step away from the basket and takes a normal jump shot. Stephen Curry, James Harden and Luka Doncic are famous for their step-back jumper. The move creates space for the shot, while providing more balance than the fadeaway.\nPasses.\nInbound pass.\nThe inbound pass or throw-in is used to restart play after the ball has gone out of bounds, after a successful field goal or free throw by the opposing team, or after a non-shooting foul. Throw-ins are difficult to defend against and so are not usually strongly contested except in the last few minutes of a close game. A long pass may be used if time is running out on the clock.\nBounce pass.\nThe bounce pass is a fundamental and very effective passing technique. This pass consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful bounce pass can easily result in a scoring assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to steal. Still, a bounce pass may be stolen due to its slower speed. A player must use their best judgment when they decide whether to make such a pass.\nChest pass.\nThis pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then throwing the ball out towards their chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in an open court and on the perimeter.\nOver-the-head pass.\nAn over-the-head pass is another fundamental passing technique. It is used by snapping the ball over the head, like a soccer throw-in. This pass is especially effective in helping to initiate a fast break. After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.\nTouch pass.\nA touch pass is an advanced passing technique in which a prior pass or a loose ball is immediately redirected to another player by tipping or slapping the ball. This is the quickest pass in basketball and is therefore very effective when executed correctly.\nBaseball pass.\nThe baseball pass is a long pass in which the passer throws the ball with one hand, as if it were a baseball or an American football. It is infrequently used, mainly to set up last-second plays off a baseline inbounding situation.\nJump pass.\nA jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, usually when a teammate gets open during the shot, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing them to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. At times, however, it is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is risky to execute, and the chances of perfectly passing the ball to an open teammate are considerably low, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers.\nBlind pass.\nAlso known as a \"no-look pass\", the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to their target in another direction. Blind passes are risky and infrequently attempted, but when done correctly, they can confuse the defense. The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Ricky Rubio, Jason Williams, and Steve Nash.\nBehind-the-back pass.\nBehind-the-back passes are passes dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind-the-back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate's chest. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. Earl Monroe was famous for this move. Steve Nash used this move often, and Chris Webber is famed for using this move down in the paint.\nTwo-person play.\nGive and go.\n\"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\nDribble pitch (handoff).\nThe dribble pitch (or the handoff) is an offensive play whereby the ball-handler passes to a player (often a bigger player) and runs by them to collect the ball, whilst the big sets a screen.\nPick and roll.\nA pick and roll is an offensive play in which a player stops to screen (block) a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket. In the NBA, John Stockton and Karl Malone were a quintessential pick and roll tandem and used this play to great effect in the 1990s. Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s. Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Blake Griffin, and Chris Paul were considered among the best contemporary pick and roll tandems.\nFrom the initial position of the pick-and-roll maneuver, the player who receives the ball has many different options as to whether they pass it, or fake and then go for a jump shot. These variations typically include the pick and pop, where by the roll man instead of heading to the basket trails behind and is wide open for a jumper, hence the 'pop', as well as slipping the screen, whereby the defender of the screener attempts to cheat and get ahead of the screener, at which point the screener does not set a screen, but merely slips by, leaving them open as their defender trails behind.\nBackdoor.\nA backdoor play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score. This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them. Also, when a defender strongly commits on defense (e.g. tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play.\nAlley-oop.\nAn alley-oop is an offensive play which involves one teammate lofting the ball up near the rim in anticipation of another teammate jumping up to catch and dunk it. Because this move requires both teammates to know what the other is thinking, the alley-oop is a rare and exciting play. The alley-oop first dates back to the mid-1950s when K. C. Jones and Bill Russell teamed up to perform it while they were college teammates. Point guard Chris Paul, and big men Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, were known for their spectacular alley-oops; during their shared time with the Los Angeles Clippers their team earned the name \"Lob City\". Another notable duo known for using this play is LeBron James and Dwyane Wade during their time at the Miami Heat.\nPass and chase.\nPass and chase is when a player passes the ball to another teammate and immediately follows the pass to either pick and roll, slip by, accept a handoff back, or other basketball moves."

        "text": "Thomas Mervyn Davies (9 December 1946 – 15 March 2012), often known as \"Merv the Swerve\", was a Welsh rugby union player who won 38 caps for Wales as a No. 8.\nEarly life.\nDavies was born in Swansea, where he attended Penlan County School. His father had played club rugby.\nRugby playing career.\nTall and slight of frame, he grew a Mexican moustache to make himself appear more aggressive on the rugby field. He was nicknamed \"Merv the Swerve\".\nClub rugby.\nDavies joined London Welsh in 1968, later moving to Swansea.\nWales and Lions international rugby.\nDavies won his first cap for Wales in 1969 against Scotland, going on to play 38 consecutive matches for Wales and scoring two tries. During this period Wales won two Grand Slams and three Triple Crowns. \nHe went on the British and Irish Lions tours to New Zealand in 1971 and to South Africa in 1974, playing in all eight tests. Colin Meads said Davies was \"the one player who probably had the biggest impact on that 1971 Lions Test series,\" particularly as he prevented NZ winning line out ball via Brian Lochore. Willie John McBride and Ian McLauchlan both said Davies was even better on the 1974 tour. Davies captained the Welsh side in 1975, when they won the five nations championship, and in 1976, achieving the 'Grand Slam'. Many expected Davies to captain the 1977 Lions but they were led instead by Phil Bennett and Davies did not make the touring party to New Zealand after his haemorrhage in 1976. \nIn a total of 46 international appearances for Wales and the Lions he only ended on the losing side nine times.\nAppraisal.\nDavies key attributes were lineout play, ball handling skill (including offloading in tight situations), commitment, mental strength, and anticipation.\nIn 2001 Davies was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. In a poll of Welsh rugby fans in 2002, he was voted both Greatest Ever Welsh Captain and Greatest Ever Welsh Number 8. Davies continues to be rated as one of the best No. 8s ever to have played the game.\nRetirement.\nHis career was ended by a subarachnoid hemorrhage suffered when captaining Swansea against Pontypool in 1976. He had collapsed during a game on another occasion, four years earlier, and had been wrongly diagnosed with meningitis. Following the second incident he was a patient in the University Hospital of Wales for several months, and received goodwill messages from all over the world.\nHe was a smoker and was diagnosed with lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) in November 2011. He died 4 months later.\nDavies had a son and daughter by his first wife Shirley; the marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife Jeni and his three stepchildren, and by his two children from his first marriage."

        "title": "Crusaders Rugby League",
        "text": "Crusaders Rugby League () was a professional rugby league club based in Bridgend and later in Wrexham, Wales. They played for six seasons in the Rugby Football League competitions, including three years in the Super League from 2009 to 2011.\nFounded as Celtic Crusaders in 2005 initially based in Bridgend, the club played in National League Two from 2006 to 2007 and in National League One in 2008. In 2009 they were awarded a Super League licence, and in 2010 they moved from Bridgend to Wrexham in North Wales, and dropped \"Celtic\" from their name. After three years in the Super League, on 26 July 2011 the club announced they were withdrawing their application to remain in the league for the 2012–15 seasons. They disbanded after the 2011 season, and were succeeded by a new club, North Wales Crusaders, in Championship 1 in 2012. They played their home matches at Brewery Field then the Racecourse Ground.\nThe Crusaders won the National League Two championship in 2007. Their last coach was Iestyn Harris. \nHistory.\n2003-2004: Celtic Warriors.\nIn the summer of 2003, the WRU voted to reduce the top tier of Welsh professional rugby union from nine clubs into five regions. The Celtic Warriors officially represented the Mid-Glamorgan Valleys area, which in practice meant that they were a combination of Pontypridd RFC and Bridgend RFC.\nFinancial problems at Pontypridd RFC led to the sale of their half of the Warriors to Bridgend RFC owner Leighton Samuel, which he gave to the WRU. He then later sold his half to the WRU who in Summer 2004 decided to liquidate the club.\n2005-2006: Celtic Crusaders.\nAfter the success of clubs in the Welsh Premier division of the Rugby League Conference, a South Wales team was mooted to join a professional league in March 2005, as the National League Two division was due to be restructured and expanded for the 2006 season. The demise of the Celtic Warriors team and backing by businessman Leighton Samuel gave an opportunity for a team to be based in Bridgend, however Coventry Bears and Bramley Buffaloes, who reached the National League Three Grand Final, also wanted a place in National League Two. The initial plan to re-use the 'Celtic Warriors' name was abandoned in favour of 'Celtic Crusaders' which had been considered by the rugby union franchise. They were to play their home games at Brewery Field and games were planned to be held at Sardis Road as well. The Rugby Football League admitted the Celtic Crusaders club; now with badge, ground, website and shareholders; on 22 June 2005 during a meeting in Salford. On 3 July, Super League teams London Broncos and Hull FC fought out a 24-all draw at the Brewery Field, drumming up 3775 fans to watch the game as part of London's on the road home games whilst their ground was being redeveloped.\nThe rest of 2005 was spent preparing for the upcoming season. On 13 November, Kevin Ellis was appointed Assistant Coach and a few days later on 16 November Anthony Seibold was appointed Fitness and Conditioning Coach. By the end of November coach John Dixon had completed his squad, drawn heavily from Bridgend Blue Bulls and Aberavon Fighting Irish clubs.\nThe club were due to play their first match against Super League giants St. Helens, but due to the team being in the World Club Challenge competition, a Harlequins RL Academy side provided the opposition for the club's inaugural match. The friendly ended in a 22–22 draw. Originally the club were to play their first competitive match at home, but their first three Northern Rail Cup games during February; against Hemel Stags, St Albans Centurions and London Skolars respectively; were switched as away games at the request from Hemel. The game against Hemel was won convincingly by the Crusaders 50–10 with Tony Duggan being the first player to score a try for the Welsh franchise (with Ryan O'Kelly being the first Welshman to score a try), and Jace Van Dijk was rewarded with the first Man of the Match award. Crusaders Academy played their first match against London Harlequins Academy on 29 January.\nIn the group stages of the Northern Rail Cup the Celtic Crusaders won all of their six games, scoring 374 points and conceding just 44. With an average of 62 points scored per match the Crusaders set the record for most points scored in a Northern Rail Cup group, beating the Salford City Reds' 58-points per game in 2003. Included in this winning run was the club's first home match, against London Skolars, where 1,021 people were in attendance to see the 78–14 victory.\nCrusaders also entered into the Challenge Cup and were drawn against Russian team Moscow Locomotive for Round 3 of the competition. They were reigning Russian Championship and Russian Cup champions and it was one of the few times that in the cup competition's long history that two non-English sides had been drawn together. However, in a match where the pitch was covered in snow the Welsh team raced into a 30–4 lead at half-time, and the match eventually finished 64–4. Round 4 provided much tougher opponents as the Crusaders were handed an away tie with National League One side Rochdale Hornets. Just three weeks after the Moscow match, on 1 April the team suffered their first ever defeat as Hornets won 32–8 and Crusaders were thus eliminated from the 2006 Challenge Cup. Rochdale Hornets again provided the opposition in the next round of the Northern Rail Cup and again they won, this time the match finished 6–34 at the Brewery Field.\nFor their first season in the National League Two competition the side performed very well finishing third out of twelve teams, earning 29 points. The team scored 730 points and conceded 387. Workington Town were the opposition for the first match and surprisingly Crusaders won 18–50, ending Workington's 23-month unbeaten home record. London Skolars were brushed away with a 70–0 victory in front of 634 fans in Crusaders' first home match of the league campaign, with centre Carl De Chenu scoring four tries. The club had decided prior to the season to take two home fixtures to other parts of South Wales, the first of which was a 36–18 win over Hunslet watched by 415 people at Talbot Athletic Ground in Aberavon. In early June, Keighley went down 58–18 at Old Parish in Maesteg in the second on the road match. It was in their third week that Crusaders lost only their second match of 2006, narrowly being beaten 22–20 in a Monday night match against the Sheffield Eagles. The club were involved in one draw during the whole season, a 30–30 tie away to Keighley in May. After several key matches, in the last game of the campaign the Celtic Crusaders secured a vital 14–11 win against Featherstone Rovers on 10 September meaning they finished third overall on points difference, whilst Featherstone who also earned 29 points finished fourth. This set up a play-off match against second-placed team; the Sheffield Eagles, which was lost 26–16 at the Don Valley Stadium. A final elimination match against Swinton proved to be the team's last match of the season as the Lions won 26–27 after 91 seconds of Golden Point extra time. Sheffield beat Swinton in the final meaning them and Dewsbury Rams, who finished top of the table, were promoted.\nThroughout the year the club were boosted by player and local achievements. At various times in the year Celtic Crusaders players made it into the National League Two Team of the Month, whilst full-back Tony Duggan and stand-off Jace Van Dijk were both nominated for National League Two Player of the Year, with the latter eventually picking up the honour in October. Tony Duggan was later confirmed as the top try-scorer from all three British leagues for 2006. Hooker Lloyd O'Connor was picked for the Great Britain Students side that toured Australia. whilst a further six players made it into the Wales national team that faced Scotland. During June coach Dixon signed three Welsh internationals, Gareth Dean from Carcassonne, Aled James from the Sheffield Eagles and Gareth Price from the Hull Kingston Rovers. At the end of the season Welsh international Anthony Blackwood was signed from Halifax. In May, Brynteg High School in Bridgend reached the Powergen Champions School Final for the second year in a row after beating a Wigan school, but lost the final.\nSome changes at the club also occurred during the year. On 8 June chief executive Chris O'Callaghan resigned after 13 months in the job, during which he was highly important in forming the club and getting them into the professional leagues. At the end of the season influential first ever captain Michael Ryan returned to his native Australia for personal reasons.\n2007-2008: Promotion and Super League licence.\nThe season was crucial for the Crusaders, as to fulfill their aim of applying for a Super League licence for the 2009 season, the team would have to be playing in the National League One in 2008, and thus had to be promoted this season. Leighton Samuel brought in his solicitor, David Thompson, as chief executive of the club to oversee the application for Super League. In January both Jace Van Dijk and John Dixon finished second in the National League Two Player of the Year and National League Two Coach of the Year categories respectively at the TotalRL Fan Awards. Just before the start of the season it was announced that Welsh former player Jonathan Davies had been appointed Honorary President of the club, and that he would be attending matches throughout the year. The club also announced that they were moving their training ground to the RAF's St Athan base, beating off competition from Cardiff City who also wanted to use the facilities; and that Frenchman Thibault Giroud had been appointed as new fitness coach.\nLike last year, Celtic Crusaders' first match of the new season was a Northern Rail Cup game. This year they were drawn in a group with two strong National League One clubs, Widnes and Leigh, and with London Skolars. Widnes came to a snow-hit Brewery Field on 9 February and won 6–56. It was the first ever match played under the new points system for the National Leagues and Northern Rail Cup where teams would gain 3 points for a win, 2 for a draw and 1 for a defeat by less than 12 points. Crusaders earned two good victories against London Skolars, but it was the match in between these two that caused the most surprise. In the shock of the round Crusaders went to Leigh and won 22–26 in front of a crowd of 1,637, despite being 18–4 down at half-time. In the return fixture Leigh were again narrowly defeated, this time the match finishing 22–14. Despite another defeat against Widnes, Crusaders had qualified for the next round of the cup. On 21 April a Crusaders squad with 11 Welshmen in their ranks defeated Hunslet 14–28 to again qualify for the next round. However the quarter-finals is as far as the team got, losing 30–18 away to another strong National League One side in Halifax.\nThe squad's second match of the season (after Widnes) was not a Northern Rail Cup game though, but a match against the 2006 NRL champions Brisbane Broncos. Arguably the biggest rugby club in the world, the Broncos used the match to prepare for their World Club Challenge meeting with St Helens. This Bulmers Original Cider Challenge match attracted a lot of attention from the South Wales media and a record crowd of 2,041 came to see Crusaders lose 6–32 with a very credible performance. Grant Epton got Crusaders' sole try on the night.\nEastmoor Dragons were drawn against Crusaders in Round 3 of the Challenge Cup. The amateur team were beaten 50–10 at Brewery Field despite Crusaders being reduced to eleven players after Geraint Davies and Terry Martin were both sent out after 65 minutes. Just like last year Crusaders were drawn against Rochdale Hornets and for the third time were knocked out of a cup competition by them, this time losing 20–16 at Spotland.\nIn the second year in the National League Two competition, Crusaders finished first with 60 points and were promoted. The campaign got off to a good start, an 18–42 away win against London Skolars on the Good Friday was backed up by a 68–0 win against Blackpool in front of an Easter Monday crowd of 2,805. In late April the club broke their margin of victory and points scored in one match records due to an 82–4 win over Swinton. The points scored in one match record was later broken again in the season after an 84–10 thrashing of Hunslet on 11 August. The club suffered just one defeat at home all season against Oldham on 4 May. It was the first ever National League Two match to be shown live on Sky Sports, and was also broadcast live on BBC Radio Wales; celebrating 100 years of rugby league in Wales as Oldham were the first visitors to the Principality back in September 1907 when they recorded a 25–6 win over Merthyr Tydfil. A club record attendance of 3441 watched Crusaders cruised into a 22–4 half-time lead, before eventually losing the match 26–34. The away match against Keighley was honoured in the same historical way as on the same day as the Merthyr/Oldham match in September 1907, Ebbw Vale made the twelve-hour train trip to Keighley to play their first ever rugby league match. League leaders Featherstone Rovers were beaten 36–28 at home and then on 9 June Crusaders beat another title-contending team in Barrow 26–14 in front of S4C as the match was broadcast live across Wales. It was the first rugby league match to ever be broadcast in Welsh. A week later the club suffered their last defeat of the campaign, 23–16 by Hunslet, before putting together a run of twelve consecutive victories to win the league. The title was secured just before the last match against Gateshead, as third placed Barrow beat second placed Featherstone Rovers 30–4. Over 100 Crusaders fan made the trip up to Gateshead to see the Crusaders lift the trophy.\nProgress was made off the pitch too. David Thompson announced that he had negotiated a deal between the Crusaders, Sky TV, the RFL, and S4C whereby Sky would surrender its rugby league exclusivity allowing S4C to televise live Crusader games. S4C commissioned Y Clwb Rygbi 13 programme in June, firstly covering the Crusaders versus Barrow match live and then continuing to broadcast nine matches overall in 2007 and 2008. In August the foundations were laid for an academy side for the 2008 season with the best players from the Welsh Conference league being picked for the team. Housebuilder Redrow Homes renewed their shirt sponsorship deal whilst a new branding of the club's logo, badge and jersey was announced on 3 December promoting a more progressive and modern image. After achieving promotion the team were nominated for the BBC Wales Sports Team of the Year award, but lost out to the New Saints. After leaving for Queensland at the end of the 2006 season, former coach Anthony Seibold returned to the club as Assistant Coach, operating alongside Kevin Ellis.\nDespite the fact that the licensing process would determine which clubs would enter the newly expanded Super League, the Crusaders were still eager to make their mark in their new division and win the league title. A new team called the Crusaders Colts were set up to play in the Conference National division and provide a route for young Welsh players to get into the main Crusaders team. They were coached by Dan Clements and eventually came second in the league table, winning 15 out of 18 matches and beating Bramley Buffaloes 26–4 in the Grand Final. The club welcomed the news in February that the BBC were going to show their highlights programme \"The Super League Show\" across Wales throughout the forthcoming season.\nAfter a 28–6 pre-season friendly win against Harlequins RL, the Crusaders played their first match against the Sheffield Eagles and won 12–22. In a group which also featured Doncaster and London Skolars, the Crusaders finished top of the league, winning four out of five games, with a 14–18 loss against London being their only defeat. The home game against Doncaster was due to be played on 15 March but was cancelled due to waterlogged pitch and after some consideration the Rugby Football League announced that the game was not replayed because whatever the result it would not change the league table and thus affect any qualifying issues. The Crusaders also made it through to the Challenge Cup fourth round again, being drawn against Moscow Locomotive in a repeat fixture of the third round from 2006. This time the Russians were beaten 58–10, despite the match being 10–10 at one point.\nThe National League One campaign got off to a great start with 14–12 victory over Dewsbury in front of a crowd of 1,618. However, in their second match a strong Sheffield Eagles team finished 25–6 winners at the Don Valley Stadium, breaking the Crusaders record of not having lost an away match since June 2007. The team bounced back with a 26–18 win over Halifax, who were at the time top of the league table, but again the team were unable to string together two wins together as a trip to Whitehaven ended in a 44–16 defeat. Halifax again provided the opposition in the first stage of the knockout rounds of the Championship Cup, after the Crusaders qualification from the group stages. The Crusaders started the match well with a try from Anthony Blackwood and controlled much of the game at the Shay. Two late tries by Halifax were not enough as the Crusaders progressed to the quarter final and a match against Widnes. In what was expected to be a fiercely competitive and close match, the Championship Cup holders were left shocked as the Crusaders ran riot resulting in a 50–18 final scoreline with seven different players all going over for tries. The semi-final was played on 14 June against the Salford City Reds travelling down to Brewery Field for the first time after being relegated from Super League the previous year. The Salford City Reds scored the first try and after 40 minutes had earned a 10–18 lead, which was quickly extended to 10–24 after the break. Two tries from the Crusaders were not enough as the Salford City Reds scored two tries in the final two minutes to comfortably win 20–36 and secure a place in the final against Doncaster. A good Championship Cup run could not be matched in the Challenge Cup as the club were drawn against Super League giants Leeds for the fourth round. The World Club Challenge champions were simply too strong for the Welshman with the match finishing a commendable 38–16 with Anthony Blackwood getting two tries and Mark Dalle Cort getting one in what was a solid performance.\nIn the league though Crusaders built on their impressive start notching up six wins in seven games in the months of May and June. This included a narrow 14–16 victory away at Widnes, a 56–28 win over Batley and a crucial win over Featherstone Rovers on 2 May. A club record crowd of 6,152, including top Rugby League Football officials, watched Crusaders earn their fourth win in a row against Rovers as Jordan James, Anthony Blackwood, Damien Quinn and Tony Duggan scored tries to seal a 28–18 win. The only defeat in that period came against the Salford City Reds who snatched a 24–22 win at the Willows, Salford. However things turned bad for the Welshmen as all three of their matches in July ended in defeat. Featherstone avenged their Brewery Field defeat as they won 42–30 at Post Office Road, Whitehaven became the only club to do the double over the Crusaders during the season as the match at Brewery Field ended 22–26, and the Crusaders were also on the wrong end of a 30–22 scoreline against Batley, who were eventually to be relegated. The last four matches, all played in August, were critical for the Crusaders chances of being in the Grand Final, and stringing four wins together against the Sheffield Eagles, the Leigh Centurions, Halifax and the Salford City Reds earned the team second place in the league and a great chance to do just that. Crusaders were matched in the qualifying play-off against first placed Salford City Reds, who had secured their superior league position in a 10–20 victory over the team in the last match of the regular season. Crusaders therefore went into the match underdogs but came out storming with eight tries resulting in an 18–44 win and a place in the Grand Final at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington. Having lost the qualifying play-off match the Salford City Reds did not make the same mistake twice in the elimination play-off and once again would be Crusaders opponents for the fifth and final time this season. In the match, the Salford City Reds scored the first two tries, before Anthony Blackwood narrowed their lead as the team went into half-time losing 6–10. A resurgence occurred though as Crusaders scored three tries in the second half, but a Salford City Reds try and a late goal pushed the match into extra-time. By this time the Crusaders had run out of steam and the Salford City Reds scored three tries over the extra-time period to win the match 18–36.\nOn 22 July the Rugby League Football granted the Celtic Crusaders a three-year licence from 2009 allowing the team to compete in Super League Europe, in what was the biggest event for the club since inception. Joining the Crusaders were the Salford City Reds and the original twelve teams of Super League which expanded the league to 14 teams. Controversially Widnes, Leigh, Halifax, Toulouse and Featherstone Rovers were the clubs who were not awarded a licence. The Crusaders were awarded a 'C' grade licence after varying factors such as stadium, finance, marketing, location, player strength and junior production were taken into account. With this result the club became only the third non-English side to participate in the league and the first side from Wales. For the rest of the season the club prepared for their top-flight debut, signing a new sponsorship deal with Brains Beer, and in November the team embarked a three-week training camp in Queensland. However it wasn't just the licence that propelled the Crusaders forward in 2008, the Super League trophy was brought to Bridgend and Cardiff in April with fans getting the chance to see it at shopping centres and schools, rugby league was introduced to Pembrokeshire for the first time, and just like in previous seasons various Crusaders players picked up individual awards and honours.\n2009-2010: Super League.\nThe first season of Super League for the team was bitterly disappointing, as after three years of strong performances the Crusaders regularly struggled against the best teams in the country. Adding to the disappointment was the announcement by David Thompson, who had led the successful Super League application, that he was stepping down as chief executive to return to his legal career. Mike Turner, the club's Marketing Manager, was promoted to the position on a temporary basis and was later confirmed as a permanent appointment. and discontent as heavy rain forced Harlequins to cancel their match against Celtic Crusaders in what was due to be the club's only friendly match.\nUnofficially Super League was welcomed into Wales in January as Richard Lewis, the Rugby League Football Executive chairman, attended the Welsh Assembly's inaugural rugby league dinner at the Millennium Stadium. On the field the squad was bolstered by news that eight players had been granted visas just a week before the club's top-flight début as National League One Grand Finalists Tony Duggan, Josh Hannay, Mark Dalle Cort, Damien Quinn, Jace Van Dijk, Darren Mapp and new signings Australian Ryan O'Hara and Papua New Guinean Jason Chan flew to Wales.\nAn early February start kicked off the new Super League season with the Crusaders against reigning champions Leeds Rhinos in freezing conditions at Headingley. The Rhinos scored four tries early on, before Luke Dyer scored the new team's first-ever try in Super League, but this could not be built upon as the match finished 28–6. A loss at the Salford City Reds a week later was followed by the opening home game at Bridgend versus Hull. A strong 5,200 crowd cheered their team into a 10–0 lead but Hull recovered, finishing with a 20–28 victory and leaving Crusaders with a three-game losing streak. The next match against St Helens provided a record 6,351 crowd but also went into the Super League record books as the lowest scoring match in its fourteen-year history as the Saints scraped through with a 0–4 scoring just the one try. Getting further into March, and then into April the Crusaders still found themselves searching for that illusive first win. A 27–22 away defeat by the Warrington Wolves caused the team to slump from 13th back down to 14th, the position in the table where they would stay for the rest of the season. It came as a surprise then that it was at Odsal, home of the Bradford Bulls, where the Crusaders finally got up and running with a 24–30 win. The team did well in establishing a 6–20 after 50 minutes, but the Bulls surged forward causing the Welshmen to cling onto a narrow 24–26 lead with two minutes to go before a second Luke Dyer secured the result. Unfortunately, the club were unable to capitalise on this win, as the Catalans Dragons proved too strong in the Crusaders first ever match with French opposition. In fact the Bradford match was one of the few high points in the season, a stark contrast to the previous three season. But in early June an injury-stricken side beat Wigan Warriors 22–16 at the Brewery Field to record a second win of the campaign. Although the scores were 16–16 late into the match, Peter Lupton drove into the corner to finish a memorable match in the club's history. A further two points were earned in July as four different try scorers helped the Crusaders to a 25–12 victory against the Salford City Reds. Before this, the team had largely been quite competitive despite the run of defeats, but the wheels came off as the side suffered a number of large defeats such as 34–0 against play-off challengers Catalans Dragons, 46–12 against Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and a 0–68 thrashing against Leeds Rhinos in front of a Newport crowd of 5,597. The latter match thus goes down as the worst defeat in the club's history as eight different players scored 13 tries for Leeds. Despite getting just six points in the season this wasn't a record, as Workington Town in SLI, Huddersfield Giants in SLIII, Halifax in SLVIII and Leigh Centurions in SLX all ended up with less than six points.\nOn 9 July the club received word that it was subject to investigations by the UK Border Agency concerning problems over players visas. A statement released by the club announced that they were fully co-operating and that the investigation wasn't just concerning the recent season, but went back over a number of years. Despite all this coach John Dixon said that none of this was having any effect on players performances. However, on 18 August, a few days before the team would face Leeds Rhinos, it was announced that the club had violated visa regulations and six Australian players were asked to leave the country, with the club soon after terminating their contracts. Jace Van Dijk, Tony Duggan and Damien Quinn, who all joined the club in 2006, as well as Darren Mapp, Mark Dalle Cort, Josh Hannay who all joined the club in 2007, were banned from entering the country for 10 years. The Rugby Football League quickly demanded an explanation from the club, in an event that naturally landed a lot of bad publicity onto the club and the league, as the club were fined £60,000. This was not the only event that stained the club's inaugural Super League season, as it was widely reported that the club were under financial difficulties. At the start of the season owner Leighton Samuels predicted a massive future for the club and that this future was secure. A little later in the season he again clarified his commitment to the club insisting that there should be no fears over the club's financial position, with Super League bosses backing these reassurances, and Anthony Seibold saying that the club will not face extinction. The club then considered a move to Newport's Rodney Parade in a bid to attract more fans and to gain extra licence points as the stadium was much more developed then Brewery Field, the latter of which Leighton Samuels no longer owned after selling the ground. Despite claims that he was helping the club prepare for the 2010 season, Leighton Samuels decided to cut his losses sometime in December 2009 and withdrew his support for the club after three years. Coach John Dixon officially left the club on 14 September after the club's last match of the season against Castleford Tigers stating that he was disappointed to be leaving after three years at the helm but respected the chairman's decision. This was amongst background rumours that Brian Noble was to be appointed to replace him. On 14 October the rumours were proved to be true as Brian Noble became the second-ever head coach of the club, with former Welsh international Iestyn Harris and former Great Britain assistant Jon Sharp being given the jobs of assistant coaches. Then in early November the club announced that it would be dropping the \"Celtic\" from the name to sever ties with the old Celtic Warriors rugby union team, and that the club was now to be called \"Crusaders Rugby League\". Alongside this a new logo was announced featuring the Prince of Wales feathers. Finally on 15 December the saga was finished as the club announced that their new home would become the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. After selling his share in the club to Geoff Moss of Wrexham FC, Leighton Samuels stated that a pot of money was needed if the Crusaders were to survive in Wales, and that the Rugby Football League were not visionaries and did not support the club enough financially. However the RFL, alongside Geoff Moss and Wrexham FC chief executive Paul Retout were delighted with the decision. As was Brian Noble who could finally get down to signing new players for the season, as he had been unable to sign anyone in his first two months in charge due to the complications of where the team would be based.\nThe club were keen to move on after the previous month's fiasco insisting they would be competitive for the new season which would start with a home tie against Leeds. New players were brought into the squad such as Michael Witt, Rocky Trimarchi, and Gareth Raynor. However, the squad was also bolstered with new young Welsh players like Elliot Kear, Lewis Mills and Lloyd White. Crusaders reached the Super League play-offs; going out in the first round at Huddersfield Giants.\nOn 12 November 2010, the Crusaders were placed into administration due to \"inherited debt\".\n2011: Administration and liquidation.\nThe club suffered a six-point deduction for going into administration at the end of the previous season.\nIn 2011 the Crusaders initially applied to continue their Super League licence for the 2012–15 period, but on 26 July 2011, they announced they had withdrawn their application. The club's owners, Geoff Moss and Ian Roberts pulled out stating that they were not able to fund the side anymore, which eventually led to the club being wound up in September. Attendances were down on the 2010 season. Crusaders bowed out of Super League with a 42–10 defeat at Wigan Warriors.\nCrusaders were offered a position in the Co-operative Championship 1 for the 2012 season by the RFL with their request to join at Co-operative Championship level having been turned down; a rival bid from Wrexham-based Glyndwr Chargers was withdrawn. Crusaders took their place in the Championship 1 as North Wales Crusaders.\nColours and badge.\nColours.\nThe club's colours were black and gold, inspired by the Flag of St David. The blue and white colours of the change strip were the same as the club colours of Bridgend RFC. For the 2009 season, the club used a red and white away strip, colours associated with Welsh national teams.\nBadge.\nThe club's first badge was used between its founding in 2005 and 2008. The badge featured the Flag of Saint David on a shield. A ribbon around the bottom of the shield bore the motto \"Oderint dum metuant\" (Latin for \"Let them hate, so long as they fear\"), which is attributed to the Roman tragic poet, Lucius Accius and later became famous as a saying of the Emperor Caligula. Above and below the shield were the world \"Celtic\" and \"Crusaders Rugby League Club\" respectively.\nThe Crusaders' next badge was adopted following the 2007 season. David Thompson, the then chief executive commented, \"The new badge is modern, progressive and business-friendly. Our Welsh identity is prominent as ever through the gold and black Flag of St David which still provides the colours of our home strip\". The round badge, ringed with \"Celtic Crusaders\", features a warrior holding a sword and a shield with the Flag of St David on it, in the background are two Celtic knots. The badge bears striking similarity to the badge intended for use during the Celtic Warriors' unplayed 2004/05 season.\nThe club have revealed a new logo ready for use in the 2010 season. The badge, inspired by the Prince of Wales's feathers, has three white feathers adorning the centre of a disc with the Flag of St David on. To the left and right of the feathers, the words \"Rugby\" and \"League\" appear on the disc. Beneath the feathers is written \"Crusaders\". The logo was created by Matthew Haselden a designer based in the midlands.\nStadiums.\n2005-2009: Brewery Field.\nFor four seasons Brewery Field was the home of the Crusaders, from 2006 to 2009. It is located in Bridgend, South Wales and the first match ever played there was against Harlequins Academy on 29 January 2006, however, the first competitive fixture was against London Skolars on 5 March 2006. It is the twelfth largest stadium in Wales, and in 2009 was the smallest stadium in Super League, with a capacity of 8,000. The ground was built in 1920 and is now home to Bridgend Ravens rugby union and Bridgend football clubs. The club played a total of 58 matches at Brewery Field, including the club's first-ever Super League game against Hull. A game against Huddersfield Giants in Super League XIV was the last ever time the team played at Brewery Field on 5 September 2009.\n2010-2011: The Racecourse.\nThe Racecourse Ground is located in Wrexham in North Wales and is the official home of the Crusaders and where most matches are played. The club moved to the ground in 2010, in time for the start of the Super League XV season. The first Crusaders match ever played there was against Leeds Rhinos on 29 January 2010, and that match is also the highest attendance for a Crusaders match played in Wrexham. With a capacity of 15,500 it is the largest ground in North Wales, the fifth largest in the whole of Wales, and the seventh-largest in Super League. It was first built in 1807 and first played host to Wrexham's \"Town Purse\" horse race. Crowd trouble stopped the horse racing and in 1864 it became home to Wrexham Association Football Club with the club now owning the ground. The Wales national rugby league team have played there once against Italy. The ground has four stands: The Mold Road Stand, The Eric Roberts Stand, The Kop and The Yale. Crusaders have played a total of 12 games at The Racecourse.\nSupport.\nHaving been the only top tier rugby league team in Wales the Crusaders have pockets of supporters all around the country, but particularly in the Glamorgan and Wrexham areas where the team had regularly played matches. The club generally attracted 5000 supporters to home matches, and whilst a low away support has been criticised around 1000 fans made the trip up to Yorkshire to see the Crusaders face the Huddersfield Giants in the Super League XV Play-offs. The club had stated that they want to expand their presence into other areas of North Wales other than Wrexham. Television presence in the form of S4C, BBC Sport and more recently Sky Sports has enabled people all over the United Kingdom to watch live matches, whilst regional coverage regularly follows the Crusaders in news bulletins. Newspapers in Wales have supported the Crusaders since formation such as the Western Mail, South Wales Echo, South Wales Evening Post and Y Cymro in the south of the country; and The Leader and The Flintshire Chronicle in the north of the country. The Crusaders Rugby League Supporters Club was formed in 2010 to provide a link between the club and fans, and replaced the old Celtic Crusaders Supporters Club that had branches in Cardiff, Newport, West Wales and Manchester amongst others. The club has also had various groups of supporters form their own rugby league teams such as the Celtic Crusaders Vagabonds who played in the Isle of Man and the Celtic Barbarians based in Wrexham. The club has several notable fans like Welsh rugby union international Gavin Henson, TNA wrestler Rob Terry, Plaid Cymru politician Janet Ryder and Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales. Online the club had their own Facebook page, whilst fans generally used the Crusaders Til I Die or Red Passion forums to talk about the club, the latter of which is a Wrexham FC forum but which had a Crusaders board and large contingent of Crusaders supporters.\nAcademy.\nLike all other Super League clubs, the Crusaders ran several teams as part of their academy system that operate under the main team and provide a route into it. The Reserve team were formed in 2006 and played friendly matches for two years before eventually being replaced by the Crusaders Colts, as part of a joint-development programme between the club and the Wales Rugby League board. The team played in the Conference National division in 2008, the fourth tier of rugby league, finishing second in the league table and beating Bramley Buffaloes in the Grand Final.\nDue to the club's promotion into Super League, the team dropped their Colts name and joined the Super League Reserve League for 2009. In their first match they beat Leeds Rhinos 48–40, but could only achieve two more victories in the season, against Castleford Tigers and Hull KR. All the reserves team's matches for the 2009 season were played at Old Parish in Maesteg. The move to Wrexham in 2010 coincided with the formation of the South Wales Scorpions, for whom many of the reserve side ended up playing and who maintain strong links with the Crusaders.\nDespite currently no longer having a reserve side, there are plans for a team to be formed in North Wales in the future. The Crusaders under-18 side were formed for the 2008–2009 Gillette National Youth League Winter season, winning the league in their first season and finishing fifth in their second, whilst still being based in South Wales. In 2009 the club's first under-16 side was set up, and in 2010 an under-15 team was added to this scholarship programme. The Crusaders also have four development squads based in Bridgend, Cardiff/Newport, Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea/Port Talbot that consist of juniors aged 12–16. Crusaders also have a junior team playing in the Gillette National Youth League under the name North Wales Crusaders."

        "title": "List of Zimbabwe national cricket captains",
        "text": "Zimbabwe became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on 6 July 1992, thereby gaining the right to play Test matches. It had previously become an associate member of the ICC on 21 July 1981, a year after the country's internationally recognised independence. Before this, Rhodesia had competed in the South African Currie Cup domestic competition. Since joining the ICC, Zimbabwe have had seven Test captains, fourteen One Day International captains and two Twenty20 captains, along with a number of youth captains.\nBefore becoming a full member of the ICC, Zimbabwe played in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, when, under the captaincy of Duncan Fletcher, they beat Australia, and in the 1987 Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of John Traicos, who had previously played Test cricket for South Africa. Upon full membership, David Houghton captained the side in Zimbabwe's first Test matches, as well as in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Andy Flower, the most successful batsman Zimbabwe has produced, captained the side to their first Test win against Pakistan in 1995. He was followed as captain by Alistair Campbell. Under his captaincy, the side achieved its first Test series win in 1998 and, in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, passed the first round for the first time.\nAfter Campbell's resignation for \"personal reasons\", fast bowler Heath Streak became captain. While Test success—except against newcomers Bangladesh—remained elusive, the side once again reached the second round of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, when they co-hosted the tournament. Not long after this tournament, however, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union sacked Streak, prompting 14 other players to walk out, leaving Tatenda Taibu as captain in the age of 20\n. During his tenure as captain, the side suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh and failed to win a single Test. Further political problems led to Taibu's resignation in 2006. At this point, Zimbabwe withdrew from playing Test matches. Since the Test withdrawal, several players have captained the one day side, although none has achieved significant success. The side is once again competing in the South African domestic competition under the captaincy of Hamilton Masakadza. Zimbabwe has regained its test status in 2011.\nMen's cricket.\nTest match captains.\nAs of February 2023, 12 cricketers have captained the Zimbabwean cricket team for at least one Test match. The table of results is complete to the second Test against West Indies on 14 February 2023, the last Test in which Zimbabwe have played. Where a player has a dagger (†) next to a Test match series in which he captained at least one Test, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain or was appointed for a minor proportion in a series.\nZimbabwe played their first Test match, after regaining their Test status, against Bangladesh at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The only Test started on Thursday 4 August 2011. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field first. Zimbabwe won the Test on day five by 130 runs. Since then they won three Tests more, two against Bangladesh and one against Pakistan.\nOne Day International captains.\nAs of January 2023, 23 cricketers have captained the Zimbabwean cricket team for at least one One Day International.The table of results is complete up to the third and final ODI against Netherlands in March 2023.\n1Andy Flower and Grant Flower are brothers.\nTwenty20 International captains.\nTwo cricketers have captained the Zimbabwean cricket team for at least one Twenty20 international.The table of results is complete up to the third and final match against Ireland in January 2023.\nYouth cricket.\nTest match captains.\nTwo cricketers have captained the Zimbabwean Under-19 cricket team for at least one under-19 Test match.\nYouth One-Day International captains.\nTen cricketers have captained the Zimbabwean Under-19 cricket team for at least one Under-19 One Day International.\nICC Trophy.\nThe ICC Trophy is the leading one-day tournament from non-Test teams, and Zimbabwe participated in the tournament before they gained Test status in 1992. Two cricketers captained Zimbabwe in the ICC Trophy."
