This is limited to those boxers weighing between 64 and 69 kilograms.\nCompetition format.\nLike all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. This event consisted of 28 boxers who have qualified for the competition through various tournaments held in 2003 and 2004. The competition began with a preliminary round on 15 August, where the number of competitors was reduced to 16, and concluded with the final on 29 August. As there were fewer than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers received a bye through the preliminary round. Both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals.\nAll bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout."

        "title": "John Wallace (basketball)",
        "text": "John Gilbert Wallace (born February 9, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player and current broadcaster on MSG Networks. He also hosts a live stream and podcast called \"Power Forward w/ John Wallace\" on SportsCastr. A 6' 8\" forward, Wallace played seven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), in addition to stints in Greece and Italy.\nA 1992 graduate of Greece Athena High School in Rochester, New York, Wallace led Syracuse University to the NCAA championship game against the Kentucky Wildcats during his senior season in 1996. After his college graduation, Wallace was selected with the 18th pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He played seven seasons in the NBA with the Knicks, Toronto Raptors, Detroit Pistons, Phoenix Suns, and the Miami Heat.\nWallace is an executive board member of the Heavenly Productions Foundation, a 501c-3 charity based in Armonk, New York whose mission is to help children in need and in distress.\nSyracuse University career.\nWallace began playing basketball as a freshman at Greece Athena High School in his hometown of Rochester, NY. As a high school junior, he began to draw attention from basketball programs and coaches in Central and Western New York, including from Syracuse University head coach Jim Boeheim. While Boeheim was recruiting Wallace, Syracuse's basketball program was being investigated by the NCAA. Two years of investigations culminated in the program losing one scholarship for both the 1993–94 and 1994–95 academic years, and a postseason ban for the 1992–93 season, As a high school senior, Wallace was named to the 1992 McDonald's All-American Team, alongside notable future NBA and college players Jason Kidd, Tony Delk, and Corliss Williamson.\nFreshman year (1992–93).\nIn spite of the ongoing investigations, Wallace honored his letter of intent to attend Syracuse and arrived on campus in the fall of 1992. Wallace started all 29 games for the Orange as a freshman, averaging 11.1 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The postseason ban prevented Syracuse from competing in the NCAA Tournament, but the team finished with a 20–9 record and advanced to the Big East Championship, losing to Seton Hall 103–70 in Madison Square Garden.\nSophomore year (1993–94).\nHaving been an \"unsung hero\" of the sanctioned '92–93 team, Wallace was a pivotal member of the '93–94 squad from the outset, a team that was ranked 20th entering the season. Wallace again started every game for the Orange and averaged 15.0 points and 9.0 rebounds per game.\nEntering the 1994 Big East tournament, Syracuse was ranked 13th in the country and 2nd in the Big East, behind a Connecticut team led by freshman guard Ray Allen and first-team All-American forward Donyell Marshall. In spite of a 30-point performance from junior shooting guard Lawrence Moten, Syracuse was bounced from the tournament in the first round by Seton Hall, losing 81–80 in overtime. Syracuse headed to the NCAA Tournament as the 4th seed in the West region. The team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen where they would fall to the region's top seeded Missouri Tigers 98–88 in overtime. Wallace had a disappointing game, scoring only six points on 2–8 shooting from the field, a performance that served as offseason motivation heading into his junior year.\nJunior year (1994–95).\nSyracuse entered the '94–95 season as the 8th-ranked team in America, before suffering a shocking 110–104 Preseason NIT overtime loss to George Washington in their first game. The Orange subsequently rattled off 14 consecutive wins and ultimately finished the regular season with a record of 21–8. The 1995 Big East tournament would end with another first round overtime loss, this time to Providence by a score of 71–69. Syracuse headed to the NCAA Tournament as the 7th seed in the Midwest region. After narrowly defeating Southern Illinois 96–92 in the First Round, the Orange faced off against Corliss Williamson, Scotty Thurman and the defending NCAA Champion Arkansas Razorbacks in the Second Round. In the game, Wallace led all scorers with 29 points on 9–12 shooting from the field. Senior guard Lawrence Moten – who had passed Derrick Coleman as Syracuse's all-time leading scorer and passed Terry Dehere as the Big East's all-time leading scorer earlier that season – would score 21. But the Orange fell in overtime 96–94. Arkansas would advance to the NCAA Final yet again, this time losing to the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player, Ed O'Bannon, and the UCLA Bruins.\nSenior year (1995–96).\nThough Wallace was projected to be a top-15 selection in the 1995 NBA draft following his junior year, he opted to return to Syracuse as the team's bona fide leader. The Orange began the '95–96 season unranked, but by the end of the regular season they had amassed a 24–8 record and were ranked 15th. For the season, Wallace averaged 22.2 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, leading Syracuse to the Big East tournament semifinals to face UConn. The game was close for the first 27 minutes, but Ray Allen and the 3rd-ranked Huskies proved too much for the Orange, winning 85–67. UConn would go on to defeat Allen Iverson's Georgetown team 75–74 in one of the most memorable games in Big East tournament history.\nThe 15th-ranked Orange headed to the 1996 NCAA Tournament as the 4th seed in the West region. After soundly beating Montana State and Drexel in the First and Second Rounds, respectively, Syracuse faced the University of Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen. The Orange forced overtime with the Bulldogs thanks to a 3/4-court baseball pass from Wallace to junior guard Jason Cipolla who made a baseline 15-footer as time expired in regulation. With 14.8 seconds remaining in overtime, Wallace scored on a lob from point guard Lazarus Sims to give the Orange an 80–78 lead. With 7.1 seconds remaining, Georgia's Pertha Robinson made a 3-pointer from the left corner to put the Bulldogs ahead 81–80, setting up a dramatic finish that would live on in NCAA Tournament lore. Rather than call a timeout to set up a final play, sophomore forward Todd Burgan inbounded to Wallace who took three dribbles to the top of the key and connected on a 3-point leaner over two Georgia defenders. The shot would give Wallace 30 points on the night, complemented by 15 rebounds, and sealed the 83–81 victory for the Orange, and a spot in the Elite 8.\nSyracuse's Elite 8 opponent was a Kansas Jayhawks team led by freshman forward Paul Pierce. Syracuse would win the game by a score of 60–57 to advance to the school's first Final Four since 1987. In the National Semifinal against Mississippi State, a roster that included future NBA players Eric Dampier and Dontae Jones, Wallace led all scorers with 21 in a 77–69 Syracuse win. In the Final, Syracuse faced off against a Rick Pitino-coached Kentucky team that was ranked either first or second throughout the season, and boasted a roster that would produce five NBA first-round picks in Antoine Walker, Walter McCarty, Ron Mercer, Tony Delk and Derek Anderson. In the game, Wallace led all scorers with 29 points, and added 10 rebounds and a block, but the Orange would fall by a score of 76–67. Despite the loss, Wallace's legacy was sealed as an all-time Syracuse great, finishing his career as the program's third leading scorer behind only Derrick Coleman and Lawrence Moten.\nOn February 29, 2020, Wallace had his number 44 retired into the rafters at the Carrier Dome, making him the last Syracuse basketball player to ever wear the \"Magic 44.\"\nBroadcast career and philanthropy.\nAfter retiring from professional basketball following a season with Snaidero Udine in the Italian basketball league in 2005, Wallace went on to work in the New York Knicks' corporate office as a team ambassador. In 2014, Wallace made his first of many guest appearances as an analyst on MSG. Frequent guest appearances on programs such as \"MSG 150\" evolved into Wallace becoming a regular cast member on MSG's \"People Talking Sports\" in 2018.\nOn November 3, 2020, Wallace launched a live stream and podcast called \"Power Forward w/ John Wallace.\" His first guest was none other than his former Syracuse teammate, Lawrence Moten. According to its official description, \"Power Forward w/ John Wallace\" features far-ranging conversations \"with former teammates, titans of industry, and fascinating guests from all walks of life.\" The live streams are broadcast on SportsCastr, a digital media platform founded in part by NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern; NBA TV's Steve Smith; Syracuse University head basketball coach Jim Boeheim; Donald Schupak, the architect of \"the Greatest Deal in Sports History\"; and Kevin April and Peter Azuolas.\nBeyond working as a professional broadcaster, Wallace is an executive board member of the Heavenly Productions Foundation, a 501(c)-3 not for profit organization whose mission is to help children in need and in distress.\nFun facts.\nWallace only began playing basketball in 9th grade. He previously practiced to be a boxer.\nWallace played the role of Lonnie in Spike Lee's 1998 film, \"He Got Game\"."

A further seven Sierra Leonean athletes also went missing during the course of the Games, bringing the total runaway count to fourteen (two thirds of the team). \nVictoria Police believed that they had fled to Sydney where the Sierra Leonean community is much larger than Melbourne's. Eleven athletes from other nations (Cameroon, Bangladesh and Tanzania) had also fled the village.\nOn request of Sierra Leone officials, the Commonwealth Games Federation cancelled the missing athletes' Games accreditation, allowing the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) to cancel their visas at midnight on Monday 27 March, and begin investigating their disappearance. \nAt 7.20am on that day, New South Wales Police located six of the Sierra Leonean athletes in a house at Harbord near Manly Beach in Sydney. All six indicated they wished to seek political asylum in Australia, and were granted bridging visas by DIMA while their refugee applications were arranged. The athletes claimed to have been subjected to violence and torture in their home country; seventeen-year-old Isha Conteh stated she could be forced into female genital cutting if she returned (ABC News).\nThe remaining missing Sierra Leone athletes eventually turned themselves in to immigration officials in Sydney. They were all granted bridging visas."

The \"strength\" refers to the control established over the opponent's weapon upon contact of one's forte with the opponent's foible (a situation of favourable leverage).\nFencer Ridolfo Capo Ferro defined the forte as the blade from the hilt to the middle.

From the middle to the top is known as the debole. For the debole only, the edges are labeled true and false, the former being the lower edge when the sword is held horizontally. The flats of the sword are not named.\nBy contrast, fencing master Salvator Fabris divides the debole into two sections, the third and fourth part (the first and second are divisions of the forte). The third part, midway to three-quarters of the way to the tip, is ineffective but not entirely useless for defense. The fourth part, containing the tip, can only be used for offense. For cuts, Fabris recommends that a portion of both the third and fourth part be used."

        "title": "Fifth ODI, Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2005–06",
        "text": "The 5th One Day International cricket match between South Africa and Australia, also referred to as the 438 Match or 438 Game was played on 12 March 2006 at New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg. The match broke many cricket records, including both the first and the second team innings score of over 400 runs. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. They scored 434 for 4 off their 50 overs, breaking the previous record of 398–5 by Sri Lanka against Kenya in 1996. In reply, South Africa scored 438–9, winning by one wicket with one ball to spare. The match has been acclaimed as the greatest One Day International match ever played.\nBackground.\nFor some years, there had been an intense rivalry between Australia and South Africa in One-Day Internationals, dating from the semi-final of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, where South Africa could only tie against Australia in a match they needed to win to progress to the final. Some followers of cricket considered that to be the greatest game of all time. Earlier in the 2005–06 season, South Africa toured Australia, where they failed to reach the final of the three-team one-day series, including losing three of their four matches against Australia. They also lost the three Test series 2–0. It was also of constant irritation to the South Africans that the Australians were referring to them as \"chokers\".\nThis match was the final match of a five-match series in South Africa. South Africa won the first two matches comfortably, but Australia fought back to win the next two, making this the deciding match. Australia had to play the series without their best one-day bowler, Glenn McGrath, whose wife was suffering from cancer. The South African team also missed their best one-day bowler, Shaun Pollock, in the final match due to a back strain.\nThe Match.\nDescription.\nAustralian captain Ricky Ponting chose to bat after winning the toss. Adam Gilchrist and Simon Katich got the side off to a good start, both scoring fifties. A difficult catch by Andrew Hall diving to his left removed Gilchrist in the 16th over while the partnership was on 97. Ponting then scored his fastest century with 100 off 73 balls, and went on to his highest score at the Wanderers ground with 164 from 105 balls, including 9 sixes and 13 fours. Ponting and Katich put on 119 runs for the second wicket, before Katich was caught at third man by Roger Telemachus off Makhaya Ntini. Michael Hussey was promoted up the order and made 81. Ponting was dismissed after his drive shot was caught by Boeta Dippenaar in the 47th over. By the end of the innings, South Africa were under pressure with Telemachus beginning the 48th over with four consecutive no-balls. Australia made 53 runs off its last three overs; Andrew Symonds and Brett Lee helping the side past the world record with 27 and 9 runs respectively and Australia became the first side to ever score 400 runs in a One Day International.\nNews sites reported how Australia had just smashed the world record.\nWith the series at two all, South Africa went out batting, giving it their all, requiring 8.7 runs per over from the start. In the interval, Jacques Kallis had broken the ice in a sombre dressing-room with the words \"Come on, guys: it's a 450-wicket. They're 15 short!\" Such a chase had never been attempted before – at that point, the previous highest first innings score was Sri Lanka's 398 against Kenya. The previous highest second innings score was 344/8, scored by Pakistan against India at Karachi on 13 March 2004 (a game which India eventually won, by only five runs). The early loss of Boeta Dippenaar for 1 made the South African run chase seem more difficult. Herschelle Gibbs batted at number 3 and reached his 16th ODI hundred in 79 balls, beating his own South African record for the fastest score of a hundred that had previously been off 84 balls against Zimbabwe. Gibbs scored the second highest total by a South African with 175 off 111 balls. He and Graeme Smith had a 187 run partnership, bringing the South Africans back into the game. When Smith was out for 90, Gibbs shared another strong partnership, this time with AB de Villiers. Australia kept the pressure on after Gibbs' dismissal with consistent wickets, but big hitting by Johannes van der Wath and Mark Boucher kept the Proteas in the hunt. Nathan Bracken, in contrasting fashion to the rest of the match, bowled particularly well collecting 5 wickets and keeping his economy a respectable 6.7. By the final over of the match, South Africa needed 7 runs off 6 balls, with Boucher on strike. He pushed a single, giving the strike to Andrew Hall who hit a four, leaving 2 required off four balls. However, he was out caught attempting to repeat the shot, leaving the side at 433–9. Ntini, the number 11 batsman, managed to get the bowler, Brett Lee, away for a single to third man and tie the scores. Boucher then hit a four the next ball (getting his 19th fifty in ODI cricket), sealing South Africa's victory.\nBoth Ponting and Gibbs were awarded the Man of the Match, but Ponting declined it, saying that it belonged to Gibbs. Shaun Pollock was named Man of the Series, although he was resting for a back injury during this game.\nReaction.\nThe huge score led Steve Waugh to say that 500 in an innings is the next possibility. Others have said that scores like this are bad for the sport, with Barry Richards saying, \"There is such a propensity for hitting boundaries that bowlers have been taken out of game\".\nCricinfo's headline for the match was \"South Africa win the greatest game\", while \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" called the match \"The greatest the world has seen\"; \"The Advertiser\" called it the \"Greatest of all time\"; \"The Age\" \"The best one dayer\"; IAfrica called it \"The greatest match ever\" and IOL \"the greatest match ever played.\"\nThe victory was also seen as redemption for the South Africans for the infamous 1999 World Cup semi-final, also against Australia. That match ended in a tie following a disastrous run-out in the final over involving Lance Klusener and Allan Donald and was called the \"definitive one-day choke\" by ESPNcricinfo.com. This victory buried the ghosts of 1999, and South Africa's \"choker\" tag was temporarily gone as in the ICC Champions Trophy 2013, the South Africans played the English in the first semi-final and the tag \"chokers\" was again used by the South African coach Gary Kirsten who admitted that the team \"choked\" that day.\nAftermath.\nThe Wanderers has since branded itself \"home of the greatest ODI ever played\". A few years after the match, they released limited edition T-shirts with the scorecard of the match printed on the front. There is a newly renovated \"438 Bar\", at the back of the Unity stand. Decorated with the wooden seats from the old open stand (it remains an open stand with new seating) and with \"438\" emblazoned onto the entrance, it is the most popular watering hole at the stadium, and a tribute to the legacy of a match."

Because there were only five Super G races held during the season (three men's events and two ladies' events), the races were classified with the Giant Slalom discipline for the season awards (as well as for the next two seasons). Another major change was made to remove the World Cup/Olympics overlap.

This system remained in effect through 1991.

In her absence, Rosi Mittermaier of West Germany, a double gold medalist at the 1976 Winter Olympics, won the women's overall title.\nThis was also the first year that a season champion was recognized in the Combined discipline, which was added the previous year. After this year, the World Cup would not award a season championship trophy in Combined again until 1980. Additionally, individual parallel slalom was made a permanent fixture at the season-ending Nations Cup championships; however, it only counted for the team competition.

        "text": "The 9th World Cup season began in December 1974 in France and concluded in March 1975 in Italy. Gustav Thöni of Italy would regain the overall title, his fourth overall title in five seasons. Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria won the women's overall title, her fifth consecutive.\nThree major changes took place on the World Cup circuit this season. First, Alpine combined races were recognized as World Cup events for the first time; both the men's and women's seasons included three combined races, all of which were won by the overall winners (Thöni and Moser-Pröll); in fact, Thöni's three combined wins were directly responsible for his edging out Ingemar Stenmark for the title. Second, a parallel slalom race was held at the end of the season, as parallel slalom had become popular on the professional skiing tour due to the visible head-to-head competition. Although parallel slalom skiing was used a few more times in World Cup competition, beginning in 1976 it became a permanent part of the season-ending Nations Cup events.\nThird, and more importantly, the new head of the International Olympic Committee, Lord Killanin, reached a compromise to preserve the \"amateur\" status of skiers receiving endorsements, manufacturer's fees, and other payments, as long as the payments were made to the skier's national association or Olympic committee and not directly to the skier, that also eliminated the prohibition on year-round training and competition in a sport. While further criticism of this rule, known as Olympics Rule 26, would continue and would lead to future problems, such as the banning of World Cup champions Stenmark and Hanni Wenzel from the 1984 Winter Olympics, the immediate impact of this change was to check the steady migration of World Cup skiers to the professional circuit. Partially as a result, World Cup races this season took place in Europe, North America, and Asia.\nMen.\nOverall.\nThe Men's overall World Cup 1974/75 was also divided into three periods with only a part of the results from each period being retained for the Overall standings.\nDownhill.\nIn men's downhill World Cup 1974/75 the best 5 results count.

He won 8 races out of 9, but at the downhill of Megève one of his bindings opened and he did not finish the race; this meant also that he could not score the 15 points for a third place in the combined of Megève (which he would have gained easily after a decent slalom result in Chamonix two days earlier), and in the end he missed the first place in the men's overall World Cup by just 10 points.\nGiant slalom.\nIn men's giant slalom World Cup 1974/75 the best 5 results count.

        "text": "The 41st World Cup season was scheduled to begin on 28 October 2006, but cancellation of the opening races in Sölden delayed the season's start by two weeks. A very poor snowpack in the Alps, along with stormy weather in January, caused numerous races to be moved and rescheduled throughout the winter. The schedule included a mid-season break during the first 3 weeks of February for the World Championships in Åre, Sweden. The season concluded on 18 March 2007, at the World Cup Finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland.\nSummary.\nThe top two finishers from last season, Benjamin Raich of Austria and Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, at the top of the standings for most of the season. With consistent podium performances in the speed races, which won him the Cup title in downhill, Didier Cuche of Switzerland finished a solid third overall. The 2005 overall champion and last year's third-place finisher, American Bode Miller, won four speed events but struggled in the technical events, keeping him from the top spots in the overall standings throughout the season. Before the final four individual races of the season, these four athletes still had a mathematical chance to win the overall World Cup title. The strongest newcomer was Jens Byggmark of Sweden, who won the first two races of his career on consecutive days in late January to vault temporarily into the top ranks in the slalom standings. Also in slalom, Mario Matt of Austria came back to win three races in 2007, regaining his top form from the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Matt ultimately lost the slalom title to Raich by just 5 points.\nThe early season on the women's side was led by Marlies Schild of Austria, who won six slaloms and a super combined, clinching both of these Cups early. But the biggest story of the season's first half was the resurgence of Austria's Renate Götschl, who was coming off a difficult 2006 season which saw her drop to 19th in the overall standings, her worst finish since 1994. She rebounded to dominate the speed events, winning four races in Super-G and three in downhill, securing the trophies in both of these events. American Julia Mancuso, 2006 Olympic gold medalist, had a very strong season, scoring the first four World Cup wins of her career. Nicole Hosp of Austria had a solid season with several podium positions, but few victories. Lindsey Kildow of the US celebrated three victories before she had to drop out after the World Championships due to a knee injury. Entering the World Cup Finals, four women – Hosp, Götschl, Mancuso, and Schild – were within a 102-point range, and each of them had a realistic chance of winning the overall World Cup title.\nAt the World Cup Finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, both the men's and women's overall titles came down to the technical events.\nOn the men's side, the race came down to Raich and Svindal. Going into the technical events, Raich looked unbeatable but a DNF for him in GS meant that Svindal would have an opportunity to clinch the title on the final day in slalom, his weakest event. Svindal needed only to finish in the top fifteen and score points in order to win the title, and he achieved it in hair-raising fashion – by finishing 15th.\nMarlies Schild seemed a sure bet for the women's overall title after uncharacteristically strong performances in the speed events. But she skied disastrously in the slalom, the event that she had dominated all season long, and failed to score any points. That meant she needed both a strong performance in the GS and a weak one from her lone remaining rival, Nicole Hosp. But Hosp won the race while Schild managed just sixth place, ensuring the Cup title (and the GS globe) for Hosp.\nMen's standings.\nOverall.\nsee complete table\nDownhill.\nsee complete table\nSlalom.\nsee complete table\nGiant slalom.\nsee complete table\nSuper G.\nsee complete table\nSuper combined.\nsee complete table"

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yokohama BayStars.\nCareer.\nCox attended Monache High School in Porterville, California, graduating in 1992. was chosen in the fifth round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics. He played in their organization for six seasons without appearing in the major leagues. He was selected by the Devil Rays with the 46th pick in the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft.\nCox broke out in 1999, when he posted an impressive .341/.414/.588 batting line with 25 home runs and 107 runs scored for the Durham Bulls, earning International League MVP honors.\nCox was first called up to MLB on September 17, , along with Jim Morris. He made his Major League debut on September 19, 1999 as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning against the Texas Rangers, in which he also earned his first major league hit, a double off of Jeff Fassero. For the 1999 season, Cox appeared in 6 games, batting .211 in 19 at-bats.\nCox began the 2000 season on the major league roster, and spent the entire season with the Rays. In 116 games, Cox hit .283/.379/.453 with 11 home runs and 35 RBIs. Cox received a single vote in AL Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for sixth place with Adam Kennedy, Mark Redman and Barry Zito.\nCox spent the next two years as an near everyday player for the Rays, playing in 256 out of a possible 324 games. In 2001, he hit .257/.323/.427 with 12 home runs and 51 RBIs in 108 games. In 2002, he was a regular starter at first base and as a designated hitter appearing in 148 games, hitting .254/.330/.396 with 30 doubles, 16 home runs and 72 RBIs.\nDuring the 2002 offseason, Cox who was coming off a career-best season, surprisingly, decided to leave the Rays and the MLB behind to play for the Yokohama BayStars of the \nNPB. In his lone season in Japan, he only appeared in 15 games, batting .200/.298/.280 with 1 home run and 7 RBIs.\nHe returned briefly to the Devil Rays organization, playing 19 games for the Durham Bulls during the 2005 season, where he hit .210/.329/.436 with 3 home runs and 9 RBIs before retiring.\nIn 2007, Cox became the head coach for Porterville College, and coached the Pirates for two seasons."

        "title": "Ontario Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) was an early amateur Canadian football league comprising teams in the Canadian province of Ontario. The ORFU was founded on Saturday, January 6, 1883 and in 1903 became the first major competition to adopt the Burnside rules, from which the modern Canadian football code would evolve.\nHistory.\nW. A. Hewitt was vice-president of the ORFU for the 1905 and 1906 seasons, and a representative of the Toronto Argonauts. He sought for ORFU to have uniform rules of play with the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU), with a preference to use the snap-back system of play used in Ontario. When the CRU did not adopt the system, his motion was approved for the ORFU to adopt the CRU rules in 1906. In December 1906, \"The Gazette\" reported that a proposal originated from Ottawa for the ORFU and the Quebec Rugby Football Union to merge, which would allow for higher calibre of play and create rivalries. Hewitt helped organize the meeting which established the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) in 1907.\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, the ORFU was one of the stronger unions in Canada, and its champion was a frequent fixture in the Grey Cup even as the game became increasingly professionalized in the 1930s.\nDuring World War II, the Ontario-based military teams played in the ORFU, filling the gap during the suspension of play by the IRFU (Toronto Navy – H.M.C.S. \"York\" played out of Varsity Stadium, using the Toronto Argonauts' equipment and uniforms.) The Toronto RCAF Hurricanes were the last amateur team to win the Grey Cup in 1942. Many from the ranks of the military teams in the ORFU became stars in the CFL after the war.\nWith the return of peace, however, the ORFU found it increasingly difficult to compete in an environment dominated by the IRFU and the Western Interprovincial Football Union, which had both become fully professional. Indeed, by then it was the only fully amateur union still challenging for the Grey Cup. Even so, it retained enough prestige that it played the WIFU champion for a berth in the Grey Cup final. The IRFU was reluctant to accept the WIFU as a full equal even after it was clear that its quality of play had become the equal of the IRFU.\nThe ORFU withdrew from Grey Cup competition in 1954. Although the amateurs would not be formally locked out of Grey Cup play for another four years, this heralded the start of the modern era of Canadian football. The ORFU ceased to operate as a true senior league after 1960, but continued play at the intermediate level. Eventually the word \"senior\" came to replace the word \"intermediate.\" By 1974, the ORFU had ceased to exist. However, the junior Ontario Rugby Football Union which was formed in 1890 lasted until the 1970 season.\nImperial Oil Trophy.\nThe Imperial Oil Trophy was awarded to the league's most valuable player."

        "text": "The Israel national cricket team is the team that represents Israel in international cricket. Despite being geographically part of the Middle East, they are members of the European Cricket Council.\nThey regularly take part in the European Championship, and are currently ranked the 12th best non-Test team in Europe by the International Cricket Council (ICC), having been an associate member of that organisation since 1974.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Israel and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 hold the T20I status.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nAs is most often the case, cricket was introduced to Israel by the British. Local enthusiasts managed to keep the game going once the British had left in 1948, but the game was struggling until the mid-1960s, when an influx of Jewish immigrants from cricket playing countries, mainly South Africa, United Kingdom, and the Indian Subcontinent, revived the game.\nThe first national league was formed in 1966, which led to the formation of the Israel Cricket Association (ICA) in 1968. The league prospered despite conditions ill-suited to cricket. Games were played on dusty, grass-less football fields, on matting wickets. However, the enthusiasm of the players has overcome these drawbacks.\nICC membership.\nIsrael became an associate member of the ICC in 1974, with only Pakistan opposing their membership. Israel competed in the first ICC Trophy in 1979, failing to get past the first round. They also failed to progress beyond the first round in the 1982 and 1986 tournaments.\nThey reached the plate competition of the ICC Trophy in 1990 and 1994 and in 1996 competed in the first European Championship in Denmark, finishing eighth in the eight team tournament. The 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia gave them a brief, though unwanted, moment in the spotlight. Malaysia does not recognise the state of Israel, and they faced political demonstrations throughout the tournament from the Islamic Party of Malaysia. They were the first Israeli sports team to play in the country and finished in 22nd and last place.\nIn 1998, they finished ninth in the European Championship ahead of only Gibraltar and the following year travelled to Gibraltar to take part in a quadrangular tournament also involving France and Italy, losing to France in the third place play-off.\n21st century.\nIsrael have been playing in Division Two of the European Championships since 2000, finishing fifth in 2000, fourth in 2002 and sixth in 2004. In the 2006 tournament, the Israeli team were again met with protests, due to the then ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Their first match, against Jersey was cancelled and their remaining two group games were met by protests. Their play-off games were then moved to RAF Lossiemouth to be played under armed guard. The second of these games, against Greece was forfeited by the Greeks, who had travel problems. Israel thus finished in seventh place.\nIn November 2007, Israel were defeated in a relegation match against Croatia, in the first international cricket game played in Israel. The loss meant that they were relegated from the 2nd European division, to the 3rd Division.

        "text": "Jerome Anthony Smith (September 9, 1930 – August 6, 2011) was an American football player and coach. Jerry was born in Dayton, Ohio and attended Chaminade High School, graduating in 1948. At Chaminade he played tight end and later in 1982 was elected to the school's Athletic Hall of Fame.\nAfter Smith's college football career, which he spent at Wisconsin, the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) selected Smith in the 1952 NFL Draft. He played at left guard for the team in 1952 and 1953. In 1956, he split time between the 49ers and Green Bay Packers. Smith played in 29 games during his NFL career.\nBeginning in 1960, he joined the Boston Patriots as a coach of the team's defensive linemen and linebackers. Two years later, he took a similar role with the Buffalo Bills; in his six years as a Bills coach, the team won two American Football League championships. In 1968, the Cleveland Browns hired Smith as an assistant personnel director. From 1969 to 1970, Smith coached in the New Orleans Saints organization. The following year, he became the Denver Broncos' offensive line coach. On November 17, 1971, Broncos head coach Lou Saban, who had also been Smith's boss in Boston and Buffalo, resigned and Smith was named his replacement for the season's last five games. The Broncos posted a 2–3 record under Smith. Following the 1971 season, he became the Houston Oilers' defensive line coach for 1972; after one season, he returned to the Browns and served multiple roles. He coached the San Diego Chargers' defensive line from 1977 through 1983. He received credit for developing the front four of Fred Dean, Leroy Jones, Louie Kelcher, and Gary \"Big Hands\" Johnson. Known as the Bruise Brothers, the group helped the Chargers lead the NFL in 1980 with 60 sacks. Dean, Kelcher, and Johnson all started in the 1981 Pro Bowl.\nSmith's health declined after suffering a heart attack in 2007. He died at age 80 on August 6, 2011."

It began on March 13, 1986, and ended with the championship game on March 31 in Dallas, Texas. A total of 63 games were played.\nLouisville, coached by Denny Crum, won the national title with a 72–69 victory in the final game over Duke, coached by Mike Krzyzewski. Pervis Ellison of Louisville was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Louisville became the first team from outside a power conference to win the championship since the expansion to 64 teams, and remains one of only two teams to do so (the other team was UNLV in 1990).\nThe 1986 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Tournament was the first tournament to use a shot clock limiting the amount of time for any one offensive possession by a team prior to taking a shot at the basket. Beginning with the 1986 tournament, the shot clock was set at 45 seconds, which it would remain until being shortened to 35 seconds beginning in the 1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, and further shortened to 30 seconds (the same as NCAA women's basketball) starting with the 2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The 1986 tournament was also the last to not feature the three-point shot as of 2023.\nLSU's 1985–86 team is tied for the lowest-seeded team (#11) to ever make the Final Four with the 2005–06 George Mason Patriots, the 2010–11 VCU Rams, the 2017–18 Loyola-Chicago Ramblers, the 2020–21 UCLA Bruins, and the 2023-24 NC State Wolfpack. As of 2018, they are the only team in tournament history to beat the top 3 seeds from their region. LSU began its run to the Final Four by winning two games on its home court, the LSU Assembly Center, leading to a change two years later which prohibited teams from playing NCAA tournament games on a court which they have played four or more games in the regular season. Cleveland State University became the first #14 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen, losing to their fellow underdog, Navy, by a single point. This was also the first year in which two #14 seeds reached the second round in the same year, as Arkansas-Little Rock beat #3-seed Notre Dame; however, they lost their second-round game in overtime. Both feats have only occurred one other time. Chattanooga reached the Sweet Sixteen as a 14-seed in 1997, and Old Dominion and Weber State both reached the second round as 14-seeds in 1995.\nEvery regional final featured a #1 or #2 seed playing a team seeded #6 or lower. The lone #1 seed to not reach the Elite Eight, St. John's (West), was knocked out in the second round by #8 Auburn, which lost to #2 Louisville in the regional final.\nIt can be argued that these upsets by the 14-seeds launched the NCAA tournament's reputation for having unknown teams surprise well-known basketball powers, and both happened on the same day. Indiana's stunning loss to Cleveland State would be part of the climax in the best-selling book \"A Season On The Brink\".\nAnother story of the tournament was when Navy reached the Elite 8 thanks to stunning performances by David Robinson. This tournament had no Pac 10 teams advance beyond the round of 64. This did not occur again until 2018.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1986 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nFinal Four Officials.\nThe 1986 Final Four was the first in which the NCAA assigned a separate three-man crew for the championship game. Previously, three of the six officials from the semifinals were melded into a crew for the championship.\nThe championship game was the last for future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Hank Nichols, who became the NCAA's national supervisor of officials. The Louisville-Duke matchup was Nichols' sixth championship game assignment.\nAnnouncers.\nStudio Hosts:\nCBS:\nBrent Musburger (First and Second Rounds), and Jim Nantz (Regional Semifinals to National Championship Game)\nESPN:\nBob Ley and Dick Vitale"

        "text": "Bradley Donald Baker (born November 6, 1980, in Brattleboro, Vermont) is a former Minor League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher. Baker threw a fastball which consistently hit 90 mph, an above-average change and an average curve.\nHigh school.\nBaker attended Pioneer Valley Regional School in Northfield, Massachusetts. He made the varsity baseball team in 8th grade and graduated in 1999 breaking almost all school records. He signed a national letter of intent to play college baseball at the University of Florida but decided to enter professional baseball instead.\nProfessional career.\nBaker was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 1st Round (40th overall) of the 1999 Draft, he was immediately assigned and played for the Rookie League Gulf Coast Red Sox, where he recorded a 1–0 record, a 0.79 earned run average, and 10 strikeouts in 4 games.\nBrad had a career year in with the Single A Augusta GreenJackets. His statistics included a 12–7 win–loss record, a 3.07 ERA, 126 strikeouts, and 55 walks in 27 games. The following year, Baker played for the Single A Sarasota Red Sox and went 7–9 with a 4.70 ERA and 103 strikeouts. He also played for Sarasota in , going 7–1, with a 2.79 ERA and 65 strikeouts, before being traded to the San Diego Padres on June 26, 2002, for Alan Embree. Just a few weeks after the trade, Baker was honored by being selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game at the MLB All Star Game. Baker finished the season with San Diego's AA affiliate, the Mobile BayBears. He would compile a record of 4–4, with a 4.48 ERA in 12 games with Mobile.\nBrad began the season with the Class A Lake Elsinore Storm, compiling a 3–1 record, a 2.01 ERA, and 69 K before being called up back to AA Mobile. With the BayBears, he went a dismal 1–6 with a 5.68 ERA and 53 strikeouts. In this season Baker would start making relief appearances.\nIn 2004, still playing with the BayBears, Brad fared much better. For the first time in his career he was moved into the bullpen on a full-time basis as a closer. Brad instantly succeeded in his new role with a 2–1 record, a 1.57 ERA, and 68 strikeouts. Near the end of the season, he was called up to the AAA Portland Beavers, where he played 4 games, recording a stellar 0.93 ERA in 9.2 innings pitched. He led San Diego's minor league organization in saves with 34 in .\nBrad went 4–5 with a 4.75 ERA, 75 strikeouts, and 27 saves as the Portland Beavers closer in . He had a good Spring Training, but he did not make the major league roster. He would also not receive a September call-up to the Padres as their closer was future Hall of Fame pitcher Trevor Hoffman and the team was in the middle of a playoff hunt and not looking to give innings to unproven, young pitchers.\nKnowing that if he stayed in San Diego he would have to compete for a job with Hoffman, the Atlanta Braves signed Baker as a free agent on November 17, 2005, to a one-year contract. He figured to have an excellent chance of making the 2006 major league club as he had a good spring training and the Braves did not have a closer. However, Baker's velocity, which had once been in the 90's was now only in the mid to high 80's. He was cut from the Braves roster and started the season with AAA Richmond. On May 15, 2006, he was traded back to the team who originally drafted him, the Boston Red Sox, and was assigned to AAA Pawtucket to complete a trade for reliever Franklin Núñez. Baker finished the season going 1–0 with a 2.40 ERA with the Richmond Braves but was 0–0 with a 6.07 ERA with Pawtucket.\nIn 2007, Baker signed a free agent contract with the Minnesota Twins and split time between the AA New Britain Rock Cats and the AAA Rochester Red Wings. His combined record was 2–7 with an ERA of 5.72.\nRetirement.\nWithout much interest from any major league teams for the 2008 season, a newspaper article in March 2008 cited Baker as stating that he was retiring from professional baseball. Baker cited loss of velocity and age as the primary reasons for his retirement.\nIn 2009 Baker returned to the mound, however, this time with a local non-professional summer league team in the Tri-County League in his native area of Western Massachusetts. Baker has stated that he will be taking classes to move forward to earning a college degree."

        "text": "The Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) was an organization for women bowlers who played ten-pin bowling and was formed in 1916 as a counterpart to the American Bowling Congress (ABC). The WIBC was initially called the \"Woman's National Bowling Association\" (WNBA), before the Women's International Bowling Congress was formed.\nIn 2005, the WIBC merged with three other bowling organizations to form the United States Bowling Congress (USBC): the American Bowling Congress, the Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA), and USA Bowling.\nHistory.\nFounding of the WIBC.\nOriginally called the Woman's National Bowling Association (WNBA), the Women's International Bowling Congress was formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in late November 1916. It was the first widely recognized women's association for the sport of ten-pin bowling. The founding women were aided by male bowling alley proprietor (Washington Bowling Alleys in St. Louis) Dennis J. Sweeney, who obtained permission from the American Bowling Congress (ABC) in 1907 to hold a national women's tournament on their lanes, and held one in 1916, providing the inspiration.\nThe founding members of the WIBC were:\nThe first official meeting of the WNBA was held on October 26, 1917, in St. Louis. Forty women from 11 cities attended the meeting and voted on the organization's constitution, bylaws, and first 16-member executive committee. The purpose of the organization was agreed to be: \nTo provide, adopt and enforce uniform rules and regulations governing the play of American tenpins; to provide and enforce uniform qualifications for tournaments and their participants; to hold a national tournament, and to encourage good feeling and create interest in the bowling game.\nThe WNBA held its first national tournament—today's USBC Queens event—in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 11 – 12, 1918.\nPast Presidents.\n1916 - Catherine Menne was a bowling pioneer. She was among the founders and served as the first president of the Women's National Bowling Association (later renamed the Women's International Bowling Congress or WIBC) in 1916.\nWIBC Hall of Fame Inductees.\n1974 - Georgia Veatch served for more than 25 years on the Women's International Bowling Congress's board of directors. She also served as president of the Windy City Women's Bowling Association and president and secretary of the Chicago Bowling Council. Veatch was inducted into the Women's International Bowling Congress's Hall of Fame in 1974 for \"meritorious service to bowling\".\nMembership.\nWhen it became a part of USBC in 2005, there were over 1.2 million WIBC members playing in 67,000 sanctioned leagues in over 2,700 local associations. Local associations exist in every state as well some foreign countries. The national tournament held by the WIBC, now called the USBC Women's Championships, is the largest women's sporting event in the world. The 1997 tournament in Reno, Nevada, attracted 14,872 five-woman teams (for a total of 88,279 participants), the largest entry for any team tournament in history and a women's world record."

        "title": "Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1950)",
        "text": "James J. O'Brien (born April 9, 1950) is an American college basketball coach who has served as coach of St. Bonaventure University (1982–1986), Boston College (1986–1997), Ohio State University (1997–2004) and Emerson College, a Division III school in Boston (2011–2014).\nO'Brien was hired as Ohio State head coach on April 7, 1997, after the firing of previous coach Randy Ayers. O'Brien guided the Buckeye program to the 1999 Final Four, 2000 and 2002 Big Ten regular-season co-championships, the 2002 Big Ten tournament Championship, four 20-win seasons and a school-record four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1999–2002).\nOhio State later had to vacate all wins from 1999 to 2002, remove all references to team accomplishments for those years, and pay back all tournament money due to rules violations during O'Brien's tenure. On June 8, 2004, then-Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger fired O'Brien for alleged NCAA rules violations. The Ohio Court of Claims determined that Ohio State breached its contract with O'Brien by terminating him and awarded him $2.4 million. However, O'Brien was initially given an NCAA \"show-cause\" order effectively banning him from coaching from 2006 to 2008, and only returned to coaching in 2011.\nPlaying career.\nA high school honorable mention All-American at St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn, O'Brien went on to attend and then graduate from Boston College in 1971 with a degree in marketing. He was the recipient of the university's scholar-athlete award as a senior.\nO'Brien was a three-year Boston College letterman (1968–71) while playing for Bob Cousy and Chuck Daly and he was team captain in 1970–71. He still holds the school single-game record for assists with 18, vs. Le Moyne December 16, 1970. He scored 1,273 points, a total that ranks 14th on the school's all-time scoring list. He twice won all-East honors and was the New England Player of the Year as a senior. He was elected into the Boston College Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1976, his first year of eligibility.\nHe was named to two Boston College all-decade basketball teams (1960s and 1970s). Upon graduation, he was selected by the Buffalo Braves (today the Los Angeles Clippers) in the fourth round of the 1971 NBA draft, but he instead played professionally for the Pittsburgh Condors (1971), the Kentucky Colonels (1972–73) and the San Diego Conquistadors (1974–75) in the American Basketball Association. He played for Wilt Chamberlain at San Diego.\nEarly coaching years.\nAfter his playing career was over, O'Brien jumped into coaching in 1977 as an assistant at the University of Connecticut under Dom Perno. He spent five years there, during which time the Huskies were 91-50 and made three post season appearances.\nSt. Bonaventure University hired O'Brien in 1982. He stayed four years as head coach before returning to his alma mater in 1986, succeeding Gary Williams who had been named head coach at Ohio State University. He was Atlantic 10 Conference Co-Coach of the Year in 1983, when he led St. Bonaventure to a 20–10 record and a berth in the National Invitation Tournament. Basketball Times named him as its National Rookie Coach of the Year in 1983.\nHead coach at Boston College.\nO'Brien coached for eleven seasons at Boston College. This tenure included NCAA tournament appearances in three of his last four seasons and postseason appearances in five of his last six years. O'Brien was named Big East Co-Coach of the Year honor in 1995–96, Kodak District I Coach of the Year in both 1992 and 1993, and Eastern Basketball Coach of the Year in 1994. \nIn 1994, O'Brien led Boston College to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament and scored back-to-back wins over Indiana and North Carolina. Academics were a strong priority throughout O'Brien's coaching career – in his first 10 years at Boston College, all 25 players who completed their eligibility also earned their degrees.\nDuring his final season at Boston College, O'Brien led the team to the 1997 Big East regular-season and tournament titles.\nHowever, O'Brien began running into problems getting his recruits past the admissions office after star recruit Chris Herren was kicked out of school in 1994 for drug and discipline problems; he eventually transferred to Fresno State.\nDuring 1995–96, at least three prospective recruits were denied admission despite easily meeting NCAA standards. When two Boston-area recruits were turned down in November 1996, O'Brien nearly resigned.\nHe ultimately left for Ohio State after the 1996–97 season and took nearly all of his players with him, including star freshman point guard Scoonie Penn.\nO'Brien subsequently sued Boston College for slander and breach of contract, suggesting racial bias may have played a role in why one of his recruits was denied admission.\nHead coach at Ohio State.\nWith Penn and most of the new arrivals forced to sit out the season, O'Brien's first year in Columbus was a long one. The Buckeyes finished with an 8–22 record, including a 1–15 mark in Big Ten play—the school's worst conference record ever.\nThe following year, however, O'Brien directed the Buckeyes to the 1999 Final Four in St. Petersburg, Florida. Ohio State set numerous school, conference and NCAA records during the 1998–99 season on its way to the school's ninth trip to the Final Four. The 2000 Buckeyes followed that effort by sharing the Big Ten championship with Michigan State. These accomplishments would later be vacated by the NCAA.\nThe 2001 edition of Ohio State basketball was picked to finish near the bottom of the Big Ten in preseason publications; however O'Brien managed to finish third in the regular season conference standings, winning 20 games and earning the school's 21st (of 24 total) NCAA tournament appearance, all this despite losing its top three scorers from the 1999–2000 season.\nThe 2002 Buckeyes also were not picked to produce a successful season. Again, O'Brien surprised the critics by guiding the Buckeyes to a share of the 2002 Big Ten regular-season and tournament title, 20 victories and an unprecedented fourth-consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament, a feat never before accomplished at Ohio State.\nFollowing OSU's 1999 Final Four run, O'Brien was honored as the 1999 Clair Bee Coach of the Year. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame presents the award. This honor was one of several including: the 1999 National Coach of the Year given by the Touchdown Club of Columbus; the 1999 National Co-Coach of the Year given by the National Association of Basketball Coaches; the 1999 Big Ten Coach of the Year as selected by the Big Ten media and the 1999 U.S. Basketball Writers Association District 5 Coach of the Year.\nHe claimed his second Big Ten Coach of the Year award in 2001 when the league media gave him the honor for the second time in three seasons. The 2001 District 10 Coach of the Year Award, given by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, followed the Big Ten honors.\nFiring controversy.\nOhio State fired O'Brien on June 8, 2004, claiming the coach had admitted to athletic director Andy Geiger that he had provided a $6,000 loan to the mother of one-time recruit Aleksandar Radojević from Serbia after he had signed a national letter of intent in 1999. NCAA rules do not allow players to receive financial assistance from outside their family.\nThe payment came to light when Kathleen Salyers, a nanny from the Columbus suburb of Gahanna, sued Ohio State boosters Dan and Kim Roslovic. Salyers claimed the Roslovics reneged on an agreement to pay her $1,000 per month plus expenses to care for Ohio State forward Boban Savovic. Savovic couldn't live with the Roslovics due to their status as Ohio State boosters. As part of her deposition, Salyers revealed that O'Brien had made the loan to Radojevic. Radojevic couldn't play collegiately because he'd been paid for playing overseas.\nO'Brien claimed Ohio State had improperly fired him and sued the university for $3.5 million in lost wages and benefits. O'Brien argued his loan did not violate NCAA bylaws because he knew Radojevic already had lost his amateur status by playing for money overseas. At trial, Geiger and NCAA lead investigator Steve Duffin both testified that O'Brien made the loan for humanitarian reasons, not as an inducement to get Radojevic to sign with Ohio State.\nNCAA infractions committee chairman David Swank testified that O'Brien's actions did not violate NCAA rules.\nA judge found Ohio State had breached the contract and awarded O'Brien $2.4 million. The award was upheld on appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals and Ohio Supreme Court.\nOn March 10, 2006, the NCAA gave Ohio State three years' probation and ordered it to pay back all tournament money earned from 1999 to 2002 when Boban Savovic was on the Buckeyes' roster. In addition, Ohio State was forced to vacate every game it played from 1998–99 to 2001–02, including its 1999 Final Four appearance. O'Brien was also subjected to a five-year \"show-cause\" order. In 2007, the NCAA reduced the term of O'Brien's show-cause order to two years. It also threw out three violations and part of a fourth due to the enforcement staff's own failure to file NCAA rules and procedures.\nOn January 31, 2008, an NCAA appeals committee lifted all restrictions on O'Brien's hiring.\nOn May 10, 2011, O'Brien was named head coach at Emerson College. After guiding the Lions to a 34–44 record over three seasons, O'Brien announced his retirement.\nFamily.\nO'Brien has two daughters by his late wife, Christine: Amy Siggens and Erin Wright."

        "title": "Swimming World",
        "text": "Swimming World is a US-based monthly swimming magazine that was first published in a magazine format as \"Junior Swimmer\" in January 1960. It concurrently runs online websites Swimming World Magazine and Swimming World News, (known as \"SwimInfo\" prior to 2006). The headquarters is in \nHistory.\nIn its earliest form, \"Junior Swimmer\" began as a mimeograph/newsletter published by Peter Daland in the summer of 1952. In 1960, Coach Daland passed the responsibility of the project to Albert Schoenfeld due to Daland's greater coaching demands as the swim coach at the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Athletic Club. The January 1960 issue was the first published in a magazine format, still called \"Junior Swimmer\".\nThe magazine then went through six title changes over the next 45 years. In May 1961, the magazine changed its main cover title to \"Jr./Sr. Swimmer\".\nThe publication then combined with \"Swimming World\" in June 1961. At that time, \"Swimming World\" was still a mimeograph/newsletter, which had been published for the previous 10 years by Robert J. H. Kiphuth. The June 1961 issue of the newly combined operation used a two part title, shown in two lines with different fonts, as \"Jr./Sr. Swimmer\" and \"Swimming World\".\nThe title changed again the following month, settling on a single defined title, all in consistent font, of \"Junior Swimmer Swimming World\" for the July 1961 issue.\nThe title changed again in May 1962, when it became \"Junior Swimmer and Swimming World\", with the words \"Junior Swimmer and\" shown as an upper line in a much less prominent font, making the words \"Swimming World\" the visually main name. In the March 1964 issue, the words were switched to \"Swimming World and Junior Swimmer\", with the lower placed \"and Junior Swimmer\" still shown in a less prominent font on the cover.\nThis prominent \"Swimming World\", with minor \"and Junior Swimmer\" title format continued through the February 2005 issue, with the magazine finally settling on its still-current \"Swimming World\" only title for its March 2005 issue, which brought attention to the change by showing only one story on its cover\"The Changing Face of Swimming\".\nOperations.\n\"Swimming World\" has correspondents in Europe and Australia, and keeps track of all major FINA-sanctioned competitions, as well as tabulating extensive records of competitions ranging from junior to masters level swimming. It also provides advice on health related and technique issues for people with an interest in swimming.\nBrent Rutemiller is the chief executive officer of Sports Publications International and Publisher of Swimming World Magazine, SWIM Magazine and Swimming Technique Magazine since 2002. Under his tenure, Rutemiller re-branded each media vehicle under one print title, Swimming World Magazine, and then re-launched all three magazines as separate digital downloads. Shortly thereafter, he launched Swimming World Radio and Swimming World TV as online properties. The Morning Swim Show is Swimming World TV's flagship program which streams weekday mornings. In 2015, Rutemiller introduced Swimming World Biweekly as a free digital magazine aggregating the top stories on the Internet every two weeks.\nIn 2017, the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) merged its operations with \"Swimming World Magazine.\" The combination provided the International Swimming Hall of Fame with an outreach arm, that Swimming World can provide, to the athletes, coaches and volunteers around the world in aquatics. \nWebsite and magazine features.\nFeatures of coaches on the website and in the magazine have been highlighted by local (University-level) news for providing a view into the unique paths coaches take to reach their coaching position and the methodologies used by coaches for training and keeping their athletes motivated.\nAwards.\nThe magazine produces an annual year-end list of the \"Swimming World\" Swimmer of the Year awards, naming winners in various categories. , the categories were: African, Male and Female; American, Male and Female; European, Male and Female; Pacific Rim, Male and Female; and, from these eight regional winners, World Female and World Male.\nIn addition to yearly awards for swimming, \"Swimming World\" allocates awards annually to athletes in other aquatics sports such as synchronized swimming, diving, and water polo.\nThe magazine also honors the top high school swim teams and swimmers in the United States on an annual summer (end of the high school year) basis, including its awards for Female High School Swimmer of the Year and Male High School Swimmer of the Year.\nNotable stories.\nThe following are a selection of notable stories where news agencies reported, referenced, highlighted, or featured \"Swimming World\" and its role in the story, and high-profile stories covered by \"Swimming World\" itself:"

        "text": "The single sculls was one of the competitions in the Rowing at the 1900 Summer Olympics events in Paris. It was held on 25 and 26 August 1900. 12 athletes from 3 nations competed. Four quarterfinals, two semifinals, and a final were held. The event was won by Hermann Barrelet of France; the host nation also took silver with André Gaudin. Saint-George Ashe of Great Britain earned bronze, after interfering with another rower in the quarterfinals and advancing out of the semifinals for unknown reasons after placing third in his heat.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nGreat Britain's best sculler, C. V. Fox, entered but withdrew.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament featured three rounds: quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. There were four quarterfinals, each with three boats; the top two in each advanced to the semifinals. The two semifinals each had four boats, with the top two advancing to the final. The final was a four-boat race.\nThe distance for each race was 1750 metres, rather than the 2000 metres which was becoming standard even at the time (and has been used in the Olympics since 1912, except in 1948).\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top two rowers in each heat advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nAshe went out of his rowing lane, interfering with Benoit. Despite this, he was not disqualified.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two rowers in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nFor unknown reasons, Ashe protested the result of this semifinal. Barrelet and Gaudin objected and refused to race if Ashe were advanced, but eventually relented. The final therefore included five rowers instead of the planned four.\nFinal.\nYet another protest marred the single sculls competition in the final, as Prével complained of being interfered with after falling in the water and dropping out of the race; his protest was rejected. Barrelet and Gaudin, who had placed first and second in both the preliminary round and the semifinal, did so once again in the final. Ashe took the bronze medal, with d'Heilly close behind him."

        "title": "List of Swimming World Swimmers of the Year",
        "text": "Swimming World Swimmers of the Year is awarded by the American-based \"Swimming World\". There are seven categories: World Swimmer, American Swimmer, European Swimmer, Pacific Rim Swimmer, World Disabled Swimmer, African Swimmer, and Open Water Swimmer of year. An award for male and female is made for each category.\nThe award was inaugurated in 1964, when \"Swimming World\" named Don Schollander as its World Swimmer of the Year. Two years later, a female category was added, and the awards continued in this format until 1980. The winners were mostly American until the rise of East Germany's women in the 1970s, and 1980 saw the creation of subcategories for American and European swimmers. Following the end of the Cold War, Germany declined following the end of the East's systematic state-sponsored doping program, while Australia's swimming team enjoyed a revival. In December 2013, Swimming World announced a decision to strip the drug-fueled East Germans of all World and European Swimmers of the Year awards.\nIn 1994, Australian swimmers won both awards for World Swimmer of the Year for the first time, and in 1995, a subcategory was inaugurated for Pacific Rim swimmers. A subcategory for disabled swimmers was introduced in 2003, and in the following year, an African award was launched after South Africa became the first country from the continent to win an Olympic relay. In 2005, open water swimming was added to the Olympic program and another category was duly added.\nUnited States swimmers have won the title 51 times, followed by Australia (13 times) and East Germany (11 times). This ratio is approximately proportional to the number of gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Michael Phelps of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by Katie Ledecky of the United States and Ian Thorpe of Australia with four. Regionally, German, Hungarian and Dutch swimmers have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than three-quarters of the Pacific awards.\nWorld Swimmers of the Year.\nThe award was inaugurated in 1964, when \"Swimming World\" named Don Schollander as its World Swimmer of the Year. One year later, a female category was added. From 1973 until 1989, the rise of East Germany's women saw them win a majority of the awards. Following the end of the Cold War, Germany declined following the end of the East's systematic state-sponsored doping program, while Australia's swimming team enjoyed a revival in the late 1990s, winning nine awards since 1997, the most by any country in that period. \"Swimming World\" has since stripped the East Germans of their titles.\nUnited States swimmers have won the title 51 times, followed by Australia (13 times) and East Germany (11 times). This ratio is approximately proportional to the number of gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.\nWith his win in 2016, Michael Phelps (United States) now holds the overall record with eight titles. He won in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2016. Katie Ledecky (United States) is the second most-prolific winner, winning in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. Phelps and Ledecky are the only swimmers to win the award four straight times. Ian Thorpe (AUS) was honored four times, in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002.\nLedecky is the only female swimmer to win the award more than three times. Four female swimmers have won three awards: Debbie Meyer (United States) in 1967, 1968 and 1969, Krisztina Egerszegi (HUN) in 1991, 1992 and 1995, Janet Evans (United States) in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and Kristin Otto (GDR) in 1984, 1986 and 1988. Franziska van Almsick is the youngest female to have won the award, having turned 15 on 5 April in the year of her first award. Thorpe is the youngest male recipient, having turned 16 on 13 October in the year of his first award.\nAmerican Swimmers of the Year.\nMichael Phelps has been named American Swimmer of the Year on eleven occasions; his streak of 2001 to 2009 was interrupted only by Aaron Peirsol in 2005. Katie Ledecky is the most decorated female swimmer with six awards, followed by Evans, who won five consecutive awards from 1987 to 1991. Tracy Caulkins won four times in the early-1980s, while Natalie Coughlin, Katie Hoff and Jenny Thompson all won three times. On the men’s side, Mike Barrowman and Lenny Krayzelburg won the award four consecutive times, while Matt Biondi and Tom Dolan captured three awards.\nEuropean Swimmers of the Year.\nEast Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning three times, before the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With the end of the state-sponsored doping program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed \"The Albatross\" in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986, record that stood alone until Adam Peaty of Great Britain equalled the feat between 2014 and 2018. \"Swimming World\" has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.\nHungary has won the award 17 times, mainly on the back of its strength in medley swimming. Breaststrokers Ágnes Kovács and Károly Güttler, and backstroker Sándor Wladár were the only Hungarian winners who were not champion medley swimmers. Krisztina Egerszegi won four awards, the most by a female swimmer, while Tamás Darnyi claimed three.\nThe Netherlands have won seven awards, through the efforts of Inge de Bruijn (3) and Pieter van den Hoogenband (4), who led the sprinting world for women and men at the turn of the century. Russian or Soviet swimmers have won seven awards, all of them male.\nPacific Rim Swimmers of the Year.\nThe \"Pacific Rim\" award was introduced in 1995, the year after two Australian swimmers—Kieren Perkins and Samantha Riley—became the first two Pacific Rim swimmers to be named as \"World Swimmer of the Year\". It has subsequently been dominated by Australian swimmers, who have won 30 of the 48 awards given. Ian Thorpe won six awards (five consecutively) and Susie O'Neill has won four (three consecutively). Australia’s success has been built on female butterfliers (O’Neill and Petria Thomas), female breaststrokers (Riley and Leisel Jones), and male freestylers (Thorpe, Grant Hackett and Michael Klim). The men's awards have been dominated by Asian swimmers since 2006. Kosuke Kitajima (Japan) was the first non-Australian swimmer to win the award more than once (in 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2010). He was followed by Sun Yang of China who won five awards (in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017 and 2018).\nAfrican Swimmers of the Year.\nThe \"African\" award was introduced in 2004, the year in which South Africa won the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay at the Olympics. Although Joan Harrison (1952) and Penny Heyns (1996) had won individual gold medals for South Africa, the 2004 victory was the first time that an African relay team won a medal, indicating their increasing depth. In the same Olympics, Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry's won three medals, including one gold, making her the first African swimmer outside of South Africa to stand on the podium. Coventry has won the female award nine times. South African Chad le Clos won seven men's awards in a row, and South African sprinter Roland Schoeman four, and in total South African swimmers have claimed nineteen awards. In 2008, Ous Mellouli of Tunisia broke the South African and Zimbabwean duopoly after becoming the first African male to win an individual Olympic gold medal.\nOpen Water Swimmers of the Year.\nThe \"Open Water\" award was introduced in 2005, when it was announced that open water swimming events would be included in the Olympics for the first time: the men's and women's 10 km events at the 2008 Olympics. The award has been won by Dutch and German swimmers five times, while Russian swimmers have won four times. Thomas Lurz of Germany has won the award five times, triumphing in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013, while Russia's Larisa Ilchenko has won the award three years in a row (2006–2008).\nWorld Disabled Swimmers of the Year.\nThis award was created in 2003, and then was not awarded in 2004. The award has been won by American swimmers six times, Brazilian and Australian swimmers four times, and Canadian swimmers twice.\nWorld Water Polo Players of the Year.\nThe Water Polo award was introduced in 2011.\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Female winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" | Male winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality"

        "text": "The men's coxed pair was one of the competitions in the Rowing at the 1900 Summer Olympics events in Paris. It was held on 25 August and 26 August 1900. 7 boats, involving 22 rowers from 3 nations, competed. The event was won by a mixed team; Minerva Amsterdam's Dutch crew replaced its coxswain with a local French boy for the final. François Brandt and Roelof Klein were the rowers, with Hermanus Brockmann the cox in the semifinals; the French cox is unknown. Second and third places both went to French boats; Société nautique de la Marne (Lucien Martinet, René Waleff, and an unknown cox) took silver while Rowing Club Castillon (Carlos Deltour, Antoine Védrenne, and cox Raoul Paoli) earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The tournament featured two rounds: semifinals and a final. There were two semifinals, each with 3 or 4 boats; the top two in each advanced to the final. The final was a four-boat race.\nThe distance for each race was 1750 metres, rather than the 2000 metres which was becoming standard even at the time (and has been used in the Olympics since 1912, except in 1948).\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two boats in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nIn the semifinals, the Dutch team had been coxed by Hermanus Brockmann, who weighed 60 kg. They saw that the French teams made use of young light-weighted boys of about 25 kg, and decided to switch coxswains to reduce weight, recruiting a young Parisian boy for the job. In the final, the Dutch team took the lead from the start. In the end, the French team came very close, but the Dutch team won a tight race with the French boat sent by the Marne society."

        "title": "Jubilee Sailing Trust",
        "text": "Jubilee Sailing Trust was a charitable organisation in the United Kingdom which operated the purpose-built three-masted barques STS \"Lord Nelson\" and SV \"Tenacious\", both specifically designed for the physically handicapped to be able to fully engage with the sailing experience.\nAims.\nThe Jubilee Sailing Trust, based in Southampton, is a sail training charity registered with the Charity Commission. Founded in 1978 with money from the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II fund by Christopher Rudd, a keen sailor, its aims are: \"To integrate both able-bodied and disabled persons through Tall Ship sailing\".\nShips.\nIn early pilot schemes including voyages in the square-rigged vessels the \"Marques\", \"TS Royalist\" and (between 1982 and 1985) \"Søren Larsen\", it was established that square-riggers were suitable for fulfilling the Trust's aims. Subsequently the Trust commissioned the building of STS \"Lord Nelson\" (designed by Colin Mudie), which sailed on her maiden voyage from Southampton to Cherbourg on 17 October 1986, and SV \"Tenacious\" (to a design by Tony Castro), which made her maiden voyage on 1 September 2000, also from Southampton.\n\"Lord Nelson\" and \"Tenacious\" were pioneers in the world of tall ships. They are the only two vessels which have been designed and purpose-built to allow people of all physical abilities to sail side-by-side on equal terms. There are 8 wheelchair cabins with two bunks each, with the remaining accommodation being 'dorm-style'. All beds are fixed single bunks. Both vessels are equipped with additional measures to allow for disabled people to sail, including: a speaking compass, visual and tactile alarms around the ship to supplement emergency announcements, disabled toilets, signage and diagrams in Braille, power-assisted steering for the ship's wheel, wheelchair lifts around the ship, wider passageways, and tactile markers to assist the visually impaired in finding their way around.\nActivities.\nEach year the JST takes around 2,000 adults to sea, both able-bodied and physically disabled. Each ship can sail with up to 40 voyage crew, half of whom may be physically disabled and are guided through each task on board by eight or nine permanent crew members (professional seafarers) and three or more volunteer crew. The ships sail around the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the Canary Islands and the Caribbean.\nFrom October 2012 to September 2014, STS \"Lord Nelson\" sailed around the world in the first JST circumnavigation, visiting 30 countries spanning all seven continents. In October 2013, STS \"Lord Nelson\" participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia.\nSupport.\nDespite a successful business model selling spaces on their tall ship, JST also relies on funding, donations, and corporate partnerships to achieve their vision.\nAs of 2022, JST had nine 'Champions' including: Actisense, Ardent Training, Classic Sailing, Cruising Association, easyBoat, English Braids, Hill Dickinson LLP, AH Monsen Ltd, and Swig Wines.\nEmergency appeal and cutbacks.\nIn June 2019, the JST announced an 'emergency appeal', with a week to save the charity. The charity's handling of the appeal and its aftermath raised criticism from many in the sail training world. Despite raising more than £1m in five days, it was announced that STS \"Lord Nelson\" would cease its sailing programme by October. There was a further planned review of organisational structures to reduce core costs, with the intent to achieve a \"stronger financial footing\".\nIn early 2021, having laid alongside Bristol docks and in a state of significant disrepair, \"Lord Nelson\" was put up for sale. In May 2022, Peter Cardy, former CEO of the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency and Sail Training International, after reviewing the recent history of the JSA and its challenges, concluded, \"Without a radical change of programme, and effective marketing of a focus and quality not seen for many years, merely tinkering with the model means the maelstrom awaits yet again. Next time around there might be no other option than insolvency and administration.\" \nNo sale of \"Lord Nelson\" was concluded and in August 2022, the ship's owning company, Jubilee Sailing Trust Ltd, was put into administration. With still no sale, the administrators put the ship for auction in June 2023.\nIn December 2023 it was announced that Jubilee Sailing Trust (Tenacious) Ltd could not continue and had also been put into administration, with all planned voyages cancelled and \"Tenacious\" to be sold. The future of the Trust itself will be determined by the Charity Commission."

Named after Badminton House in Clifton, Bristol, where it was founded, the school has been located at its current site since 1924 and consistently performs well in the government's league tables, particularly at A-Level.\nIn 2008 the school was ranked third in the \"Financial Times\" top 1,000 schools.\nIn the 2023 A-Levels, the school saw 48.5% of its candidates score A*/A.\nAccording to the \"Good Schools Guide\", \"The secret of the school's success is in its size and a good deal of individual attention.\"\nSchool history.\nMiriam Badock established a school for girls in 1858 at Badminton House in Clifton, Bristol. By 1898 it had become known as Miss Bartlett's School for Young Ladies.\nThe school developed a broad curriculum, and extracurricular activities, including sports, were encouraged which was unusual for the time. The school grew steadily in size, and in 1924 moved to the present site, under the headship of Beatrice May Baker (1876–1973). Baker, known as BMB, was fundamental in shaping Badminton's ethos and had a deep personal influence on individual pupils.\nShe encouraged the girls to be aware of world affairs and internationalism. A pioneer in many educational fields, she established Badminton as a much-admired progressive school. She insisted on the rights of young people to freedom of expression and encouraged a questioning approach to learning: \"in chapel 'Jesus often had to share the stage with Lenin\". The international outlook she pioneered continues today.\nIn 1958, the school celebrated its centenary with the opening of a new Science Centre by Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Dame Sybil Thorndike was president of the school at that time, and a new cantata called \"The Crown of the Year\" by Michael Tippett was specially commissioned to mark the event.\nBy the late 1960s, the progressive aspects of the school had all but vanished (Royston Lambert speech at Exeter University, 19 November 1971) and it had become a standard independent academic school.\nOld Badmintonians.\nAlumnae of the school are known as Old Badmintonians."

        "title": "Australian Baseball League (1989–1999)",
        "text": "The Australian Baseball League (ABL) was a baseball league, established in 1987 and disbanded in 1999.\nFormation.\nBefore the formation of the Australian Baseball League, the Claxton Shield, established in , was Australia's premier baseball tournament. The idea of an Australian baseball league was first conceived in , possibly prompted by the success of Australia's National Basketball League. The final Claxton Shield competition was held in 1988 by the Auburn Baseball Club in New South Wales at its home ground of Oriole Park. Auburn funded all visiting teams' fares and accommodation with the expectation of recouping from gate takings and increased revenue at its social club. Soon after, the ABL was formed, with eight teams from around Australia.\nCompetition structure.\nThe Australian Baseball League was much like many other professional baseball leagues around the world, with teams playing home and away series during a regular season, playing to compete in the playoffs, the winner of which being crowned champions.\nThe season length ranged from 42 to 62 games, depending on the number of teams in the season. The competition used the designated hitter rule, much like the Major League Baseball's American League, but allowed aluminium bats for non-MLB contracted players, with the contracted players using wood. There were also allowances in place for pinch runners to run for a catcher if he made base safely, this was put in place for not only speed up the break between innings waiting for a catcher to change into his gear, but to create more excitement on the basepaths. Import restrictions also applied in the League as to nurture home grown talent\nThe ABL experimented with many different types of scheduling to try to increase attendances, including day and night games at different times of the week, seven-inning double headers. The length of games became a problem as many grounds had night curfews.\nLeague history.\nThe Australian Baseball League consisted of between six and nine teams over its 10 years of existence, with its highest point being in 1995, with nine teams competing. Championships were decided by a top-two five-game playoff series for the first three seasons before changing to a top-four playoff series with winners advancing to the championship series. Following the change to the top four format, both semi-finals and the championship series were played as best-of-three series.\nThe Australian Baseball League formally got underway in October 1989, representing Australia's first professional \"major league\" of baseball. Officially, the first ABL game was contested between Perth Heat and Adelaide Giants at Parry Field in Perth on 27 October 1989, with the Giants winning 8-5. The inaugural season was dominated by the Waverley Reds a record of 34 wins and 6 losses, who only lost 2 games at home in 19 starts, and took the Championship series 3 games to 1 against their crosstown rivals, the Melbourne Monarchs.\nThe 1990–91 ABL championship was won by the Perth Heat, who defeated the minor premiers, the Gold Coast's Daikyo Dolphins, by three games to two.\nIn a reversal of the previous season, the 1991–92 ABL title was won by the Daikyo Dolphins, who defeated the Perth Heat three games to one.\nThe first year of the four-team finals format, the championship series saw the Melbourne Monarchs face the minor premier Perth Heat at Perth's Parry Field, having eliminated the Sydney Blues and Waverley Reds, respectively. The Melbourne Monarchs defeated the Heat two games to nil in the final to clinch the 1992–93 ABL championship.\nWon by the Brisbane Bandits, who defeated the minor premier Sydney Blues two games to nil in the championship series held at Parramatta Stadium. The Perth Heat and Adelaide Giants, respectively, were the two defeated semi-finalists.\nWon by the Waverley Reds, who defeated the Perth Heat two games to nil at Moorabbin Oval. The Sydney Blues (defeated by the Reds) and East Coast Cougars (defeated by the Heat) were eliminated in the semi-finals.\nWon by the Sydney Blues, who defeated the Melbourne Reds two games to nil in the Blues' only season at the old Sydney Showground at Moore Park. In the first time a team had reached the final from fourth place, the Reds defeated the minor premier Brisbane Bandits in the semi-final, while the Perth Heat were eliminated by the Blues.\nWon by the Perth Heat, who defeated the Brisbane Bandits in three games.\nWon by the Melbourne Reds, who defeated the East Coast Cougars in two games.\nThe final ABL Championship, held as a test event at the new Sydney Showground at Sydney Olympic Park, was taken in two games by the Gold Coast Cougars (who defeated the Sydney Storm), after the Adelaide Giants dominated the regular season.\nDecline and sale.\nThe ABL had a total running cost of $6 million by the later half of the 1990s, due to a lack of sponsorship and gate takings the league was only raising $4 million by the final season. Due to these mounting debts the Australian Baseball Federation sold off the rights to the league and Claxton Shield to Australian baseballer David Nilsson for a reported $5 million who replaced it with the International Baseball League of Australia, which in turn folded in 2002.\nOriginal clubs.\nOver the ten years of the Australian Baseball League, a total of twelve franchise licences were issued; most seasons the ABL had a total of eight teams, but had as many as nine, and, for the final season, six. The founding eight teams of the Australian Baseball League were:\nLater additions.\nLater additions to the league were:\nPlayers.\nThe ABL experienced a lot of baseball talent not only from Australia, but from overseas, with over 90 MLB or future MLB players playing over the history of the competition. Many of these import players were sent to Australia from rookie ball up to advanced A (with some exceptions) as a winter ball league that provided a different environment to winter leagues in Latin America. It proved to be a good 'instructional league' for MLB organisations or even for extended rehabilitation. Many of the import players would not come back for a second season as they were either advanced in their organisation, or replaced by a different player who was thought could benefit from playing in Australia.\nNew Australian Baseball League.\nWhile no confirmation was forthcoming from either source, plans were apparently hatched between the Australian Baseball Federation and Major League Baseball to re-establish an Australian national league in November 2008. The new national league was proposed to run for 10 weeks from November 2008 to February 2009 and to be partly funded by Major League Baseball.\nOn 10 August 2007 it was announced the 2008 Claxton Shield would be run as a \"home and away\" series. The revamped series was made up of two pools of three teams, with each team playing three home and three away games against the other two teams in its pool. Pool A was to be made up of the Victoria Aces, Perth Heat and South Australia, and Pool B was to be made up of the New South Wales Patriots, Queensland Rams and Australia Provincial. The revamped series was run from late December 2007 to early February 2008.\nThe 2009 series followed a similar format, but without the Australia Provincial team, resulting in each team playing each other team once in either a home or an away three-game series, in addition to a \"showcase\" round to start the season, held in Sydney with each team playing every other team once over the course of the week.\nOn 1 July 2009, a joint announcement was made by the Australian Baseball Federation, Australian Federal Government and Major League Baseball stating the intention to resurrect a national baseball league for Australia, with the Government announcing A$400,000 towards the new league.\nIt was originally planned that the Australian Baseball League would eventually have a 60-game season from November to February consisting of teams from Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney with a pending spot for Canberra. The league is 75% owned by Major League Baseball and 25% by the Australian Baseball Federation. The first ABL season is scheduled for November–February 2009/2010, but will be run under the banner of the 2010 Claxton Shield with 2011 season scheduled to be the first 'official' season. Some players will be paid, and some will not, with an average salary expected to be about A$800 per month. Players will be under contract, although the system of player-league relations will be highly centralized in the ABF for the league's early years in order to ensure cheap and efficient league operation. In November 2009 referendums were held on team names.\nIn November 2009, the Australian Baseball League approved Canberra's bid for a 6th spot in the inaugural ABL season with the ACT Government contributing $75,000 for the first season, and $30,000 every other season. Also, the franchise already has over $64,000 from 3200 people pledging support at $20 a head during the bid attempt. ActewAGL, Rolfe Audi were announced as major sponsors of the team.\nIn May, 2010, the Australian Baseball League made steps towards marketing their product, producing a website and two advertisements shown on ESPN Australia and ONE HD. The logo was officially unveiled and the Melbourne franchise's general manager, Stephen Nash, announced a 40-game season between six franchises over 10 weeks from November to January, with a post-season finals series in February.\nOn 5 August 2010, the team names for the Australian Baseball League were made public. They include the Brisbane Bandits, the Sydney Blue Sox, the Canberra Cavalry, the Melbourne Aces, the Adelaide Bite and the Perth Heat.\nSince its beginning in 2010, the Australian Baseball League has expanded to have 8 teams on its roster, with the addition of the Auckland Tuatara and Geelong-Korea in the 2018/2019 Season. The League has also been divided into the South-West Division and the North-East Division."

The team is organised by the Belgian Cricket Federation, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2005 (and previously an affiliate member, from 1991). Belgium played its first international match in 1910, in an exhibition tournament in Brussels that also featured France, the Netherlands, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Since the 1990s, the team has regularly competed in European Cricket Council (ECC) tournaments, usually in the lower divisions.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe first game of modern cricket in Belgium appears to have been a match played by British soldiers before the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, though research has suggested that cricket may be related to a game exported from Flanders to England in the Sixteenth Century. The first record of organised cricket is a painting dated 1870 that hangs in the pavilion of Lord's Cricket Ground in London that depicts the opening of the Brussels cricket ground in 1866 by mayor Jules Anspach.\nThe national team first played a match in 1905 when they played against the Netherlands. The match was played almost every year until 1986. Belgium hosted a tournament as part of the 1910 Brussels Exhibition also involving France, the MCC and the Netherlands. Belgium lost their match against the MCC by an innings and lost to the Netherlands by 116 runs.\nICC membership.\nBelgium became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1991. They began to play in European tournaments, playing in the ECC Trophy for the first time in 1999 when they finished last. They fared better in the next tournament, reaching the semi-finals of the 2001 ECC Trophy in Austria.\nThey finished sixth in the ECC Trophy in 2003, and gained associate membership of the ICC two years later. Belgium finished fourth in the European Affiliates Championship in 2005 and both played and hosted Division Three of the newly restructured European Championship in August 2007, they finished fifth.\nIn 2009 Belgium played in La Manga Club Ground, again in Division 3. Richard Nash captained the team and finished fourth. In 2011 Belgium hosted the new 2011 ICC European T20 Championship Division Two where they won the championship undefeated. The captain for the T20 squad was André Wagener.\nBelgium got promoted to Division 1 where they finished a credible 7th out of 12 teams having fielded a weakened team because of visa issues. Their performance qualified them for the WCL 8 qualifier the following year.\nIn 2012 Belgium played the World Cricket League 8 Qualifier in La Manga Club Ground where they beat Gibraltar, Austria and France to qualify for the World Cricket league for the first time. Captained by Sheriyar Butt and Simon Newport in this tournament, they will travel to Samoa in September. On July 31, the Under-19 Belgium Cricket Team (Aadit Sheth, Aaryan Mehta, Raj Sanghvi, Sabhya Jain, Burhan Niaz, Shaan Shah, Dev Jogani, Aarjav Jain, Alex Uzupris, Theodore Develodore, Aamad Ali Rehman, Rehaan Shah, and Zeeshan Diwan Ali), travelled to Essex to participate in the U19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Europe Division 2.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Belgium and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Belgium played their first Twenty20 International on 11 May 2019 against Germany.\nIn August 2020, Belgium won the 2020 Luxembourg T20I Trophy tournament, after winning all four matches they played in.\nCurrent squad.\nYear: 2020-21\nTournament history.\nEuropean Affiliates Championship.\nOne-Day\nT20\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Belgium\n\"Last updated 11 June 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Belgium \nMost T20I wickets for Belgium \nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2093.

        "text": "Parque La Huasteca is a municipal park in Monterrey, Mexico and also the first established climbing area, only 20 minutes from the city center. With nearly 400 bolted routes with grades from 5.4 to 5.14, it is the favorite place for weekend climbers. There are no entrance fees for most of the climbing areas\nClimbing Areas.\nCazuelas: Near the entrance, to the left, near an iron door. Harder moderate climbs.\nPico Lico: Past Cazuelas, a triangular rock. Easy climbs.\nLos Perros: On the right, just past the entrance. Very easy climbs.\nLulu: Past Los Perros, to the left and below. Easy climbs.\nPico Independencia: The salient feature of the park on the right of the road, has a via ferrata to the top. Moderate and hard sport, trad, mixed climbs.\nLas Hienas: To the right of Pico Independencia. Difficult climbs.\nZona Extrema: A mile into the canyon, on the left. Easy to harder moderate climbs.\nLos Médicos: Past the small village of Nogales. Most popular sport and multi-pitch walls.\nCasa del Doctor: Below and to the right of a house built into the stone.\nLa Marta: Follow the same wall to the right of the routes below Casa del Doctor.\nLa Bestia Cueva: A truly ginormous cave on the hillside at the rear of the canyon.\nVirgincita: The smaller cave to the right of Cueva de Virgin on Independencia.\nHistory.\nIn 1954 Federico Ramírez García, also known as \"Lico\", climbed the first summit of La Huasteca. Today that summit is known as \"Pico Lico\" in his honor. Pico Lico is nearly 70 meters high.\nIn 1957 the most famous peak in La Huasteca was conquered by a climbing club called Pirineos, hence the autonomous name of the peaks \"Los Pirineos\".\nIn 1960 the West Face was first climbed: Alberto Perez from Pirineos climbed almost all the route except the last 60 meters, then a couple of friends threw him a rope from above to complete the climb. The first person to climb the West Face without any assistance was Juan de Dios De Leon Camero. Others followed, conquering more summits and bolting some routes.\nIt the late 1980s and 1990s, sport climbing began with Francisco Medina, and Andres Medina, two brothers and students of the Juan de Dios climbing school.\nThey bolted and climbed the hardest routes in La Huasteca, \"Veneno\" and \"El Sueño que de Niño\", both 5.13c.\nIn the 2000s climbing became more popular, when the Universidad de Monterrey and the ITESM, two well-recognized universities, started giving climbing courses at La Huasteca.\nIn 2005, the first guidebook was written by Ramón Narváez, a local climber. The area appears in the larger English-Spanish Guía de Escalada en México (Zona Norte), using the exact drawings and contents of the original Huasteca guidebook without permission from the author.\nBy 2010 UDEM suspend the climbing courses because of Mexico's recession and the increase in violence in the city during the ongoing \"War on Drugs\".\nDuring Hurricane Alex, La Huasteca was severely impacted, damaging several routes and also lowering the level of the ground by down to 1 meter, making the beginning of some routes unclimbable.\nIn 2014, at-risk youth program Escalando Fronteras joined forces with volunteers to further develop the park for visitors and eco-tourism. The same year, British climber Gareth \"Gaz\" Leah completed the direct line to Huastecas famous Pico Independencia, named \"The Life You Can Save\" 5.12+ 350m. The route name was donated by Alex Honnold who took part in the Escalando Fronteras Kickstarter campaign.\nIn 2016, Gareth \"Gaz\" Leah released a new guidebook to Parque La Huasteca on a digital platform known as RAKKUP covering many new areas not covered in previous guides. The print release is due in the next month.\nClimate.\nLa Huasteca is a desert, very similar to Potrero Chico.\nEnvironmental issues.\nSince the 1990s, La Huasteca has become a popular weekend destination for families. People number in the hundreds every day, and more in the rare occasions when the river is swollen from heavy rains. Because of the large number of visitors, La Huasteca is suffering from a greater amount of litter.\nDuring 2004 the government tried to solve this problem by charging families 10 pesos to enter some parts of the park, while leaving the climbing areas free to enter. This has not been successful, as families simply stopped entering the paid-access areas and instead went to the free climbing areas, especially \"Navajas\" and \"Cazuelas\".\nFrom late 2004 to late 2005 a new campaign called \"Limpiemos la Huasteca\" was conducted, with the objective of cleaning all the garbage from La Huasteca. Private and public schools, members of the climbing community, members of the cycling community, and anyone else wanting to help were encouraged to clean up this area. To aid in the removal of garbage, the government supplied trucks to transport waste.\nAlthough La Huasteca was improved, much work remained to be done, as the waste was being generated faster than it was being removed.\nAll visitors to la Huasteca are encouraged to bring a bag and remove some waste.\nRecent deaths.\nIn recent years la Huasteca has seen an increase in accidents involving climbers and campers. Local authorities had associated this with the opening of a Via Ferrata route; this controversial route was built over an old classic route \"El Infierno y las Espinas\", rendering the old route useless as most of the new people climbing the route use the Ferrata and don't have the necessary climbing experience.\nThis route has seen the death of at least one person acting as a guide when he did not have the credentials required, and the rescue of another overweight excursionist who couldn't continue and got stuck in the middle of a Tyrolean traverse of 100 metres.\nAdditionally, the mysterious death of two climbers occurred when they fell while rappelling from a multi-pitch route. A non-climbing-related death of a camper occurred by gunfire during a robbery attempt, and another person drowned in the river under the influence of alcohol.\nThe climbing community is planning to address the recent deaths by reviewing the credentials of those who act as climbing guides and teachers."

To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 20th century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.\nThe top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:—Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).\nThe nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 MLB All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.\nPete Rose controversy.\nThere was controversy over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball. Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence. After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later. On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his 2004 autobiography \"My Prison Without Bars\"."

It was first contested at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz and again in 1948 Winter Olympics, after which it was discontinued as an Olympic sport. \nIn October 1999, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) added the discipline to the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics sports program, with both men's and women's events, and has been held in each Winter Olympic competition since. In June 2022, the IOC added a third event, the mixed team, to the sports program at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nSkeleton is so-named as the first metal sleds introduced in 1892 were said to resemble a human skeleton.

Argentina defeated the Czech Republic in the title game by the score of 2–1, thus managing a back-to-back world title, its fifth in the past seven editions, and sixth overall. Argentine player Sergio Agüero was given the FIFA U-20 Golden Shoe (top scorer, with six goals) and the FIFA U-20 Golden Ball (best player of the tournament), while Japan earned the FIFA Fair Play Award.\nThe tournament featured 24 teams coming from six continental confederations; Canada qualified automatically as hosts, while the remaining teams qualified based on their rankings at the respective continental U-20 (U-19 in Europe's case) tournaments. UEFA (Europe) qualified six teams; AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean) and CONMEBOL (South America) four teams each; and OFC (Oceania) one team.\nThe tournament took place in a variety of venues across the country – Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Victoria and Burnaby (Vancouver) – with the showcase stadium being Toronto's new National Soccer Stadium where the final match was held. 19 years later Canada will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nOn 28 June 2007, two days before the inaugural match, it was reported that 950,000 tickets had been sold, making it the largest single-sport event ever taking place in the country, and on 3 July, the tournament organizers sold the millionth ticket. On 19 July, the semi-final match between Chile and Argentina marked this edition as the most attended in the tournament's history, with an accumulated attendance of 1,156,187 spectators, surpassing Mexico 1983's 1,155,160 spectators. Attendance totalled 1,195,299 after the final match.\nBids.\nThree countries launched bids to host the competition: Canada, Japan and South Korea. On August 6, 2004 the FIFA Emergency Committee unanimously awarded the rights to host the event to Canada over South Korea (Japan did not submit an official bid).\nQualification.\nTwenty-three teams qualified for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. As the host team, Canada received an automatic bid, bringing the total number of teams to twenty-four for the tournament. The final draw for the group stages took place on 3 March 2007 in Liberty Grand Entertainment Complex, Toronto.\nSquads.\nFor a list of the squads see \"2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup squads\"\nGroup stage.\nThe 24 participating teams were distributed between six groups of four teams each, according to a draw held on 3 March 2007. The groups are contested on a league system, where each team plays one time against the other teams in the same group, for a total of six matches per group. Each group winner and runner-up teams, as well as the best four third-placed teams, qualify for the first round of the knockout stage (round of 16).\nGoalscorers.\nWith six goals, Sergio Agüero was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 135 goals were scored by 84 different players, with one of them credited as own goals.\nAwards.\nSource:\nControversies.\nNigerian accusations of racism.\nThe quarter-final match between Chile and Nigeria took place on FIFA's \"Say No To Racism Day.\" During extra time, Chile's Jaime Grondona scored at the 96th minute, but Nigerians claimed that it was offside. Despite their protest, referee Howard Webb allowed the goal to stand, and the goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa received a yellow card for his protest. Replays showed that a defender was out of place, and it was not offside.\nAfter the game, Nigerian coach Ladan Bosso accused Webb of racism in a press conference, stating that \"the officiating, I think FIFA has a long way to go to beat racism because that official showed racism.\" When asked directly if he felt Webb was a racist, Bosso responded by stating that \"It's good for FIFA to bring in the fight against racism, but they have to follow it to the letter so that the implementation will be done.\" The coach was fined CHF 11,000 and banned for four months, as the disciplinary committee found him guilty of \"offensive behaviour\" under the terms of article 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.\nThe Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) was also sanctioned for allowing the players to wear T-shirts with religious statements under their game jerseys. This was a violation of the regulations of the tournament, which state: \"Players and officials are not allowed to display political, religious, commercial or personal messages in any language or form on their playing or team kits...\"\nChilean clash with police.\nOn 19 July 2007, there was a clash between Chilean players and police officers following the semi-final match between Chile and Argentina. The Chilean players were angry with referee, Wolfgang Stark, claiming that he had \"lost control of the match early on\" and complained about receiving seven yellow cards and two red cards, with a total of 53 fouls committed. After the game, Stark and his colleagues were surrounded by Chilean players, and Toronto Police Service members had to intervene to restrain them. Stark was escorted off the pitch and into the dressing room tunnel by the police, due to fears that he would be attacked by the crowd or Chilean players. Afterwards, there was a brawl between several players and delegates of the Chilean team and police outside Toronto's National Soccer Stadium.\nAccording to Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, the altercation began when Chilean players got into a scuffle with a rival fan. He added that \"members of the Chilean team then decided to direct some of their aggressive behaviour towards my officers... The job of my officers was to respond in a firm, but fair, manner to end that violence. They are trained to do so, and that is what they did.\" The Chilean players, however, stated that Isaías Peralta walked towards Chilean fans located behind a security fence, but was stopped by about ten policemen. They further stated that a heated discussion took place, and Peralta (who speaks no English) was verbally and physically abused by the policemen.\nPeralta was tasered by a police officer and lost consciousness for 20 minutes. Subsequently, other players became involved in a struggle with the police, but eventually returned to their bus and closed the doors. Eyewitnesses reported that players on the bus threw objects at the police through the windows and attempted to grab officers from inside the damaged bus. Three minutes later, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the president of the Chilean National Association of Professional Football (ANFP), asked the players to exit the bus and board a different one. As the players were leaving the bus, the police then took them back to the stadium.\nFIFA spokesman, John Schumacher, stated that \"the Chilean players were detained by the police to de-escalate the situation that was taking place in front of the stadium. Ten Chilean team members were detained over three hours and then released without charges.\" The following day, FIFA president Sepp Blatter expressed at a press conference in Toronto that the incident was \"regrettable\" and that he \"apologised in the name of FIFA.\" The ANFP hired a Toronto-based law firm to pursue legal action against the Toronto police.\nThe incident was on the front page of every major Chilean newspaper. Following the incident, the Canadian embassy in Santiago received a bomb threat, and angry Chileans protested outside the embassy holding signs that read \"Racist Canada.\" Chilean President Michelle Bachelet described the incident as \"particularly serious because, in our view, the Chilean delegation suffered unjustified aggression\" and lodged a formal protest with the Canadian government. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper remarked that \"international soccer matches are hotly contested and often become very emotional. As you know, there are processes in Canada by which the authorities review these kinds of incidents and I don't intend to comment further.\"\nAccording to reports in Canadian media, a Chilean team member punched a female police officer in the face before Peralta was tasered. An internal review led by Superintendent Jim Ramer determined that officers acted professionally and with \"an immense amount of restraint\" during the conflict outside BMO Field, in which Chilean players \"punched, kicked, spat on, and kicked\" police and security staff. The report stated that the violence began when two individuals not involved in the game confronted each other. Security guards attempted to intervene, followed by police, when a Chilean player punched a female police officer in the face. From that point, the report stated that the violence escalated, with Chilean players dismantling armrests and footrests from the bus seats and smashing windows in order to spit and throw objects at police, including D batteries, clothes hangers, and cans of deodorant. Four officers were reportedly injured by projectiles. FIFA agreed to pay for the $35,000 cost of damages to the team's rented bus.\nMayne-Nicholls, who was a witness to the incident, stated that \"I didn't see any Chilean player hitting any officer except between all the struggling.\" Patricio Bascuñán, the president of the Salvador Allende Cultural Society of Toronto, called for an independent review.\nGrondona was suspended for nine months at all levels, including domestic and international play, and fined CHF 7,000 (including procedural costs) for assaulting match officials. The Chilean football association was fined CHF 15,000 for \"team misconduct.\""

For example, Indianapolis played the most games with 85, followed by Kansas City at 80, Detroit with 74, and Chicago with 62. The latter team with its superior winning percentage among the group is generally considered the pennant winner.\nEast (independent teams) final standings.\nA loose confederation of teams were gathered in the East to compete with the West, however East teams did not organize a formal league as the West did."

        "title": "Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament, otherwise known as the Pac-12 tournament, was the annual concluding tournament for the NCAA college basketball in the Pac-12, taking place in Las Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena. The first tournament was held in 1987 for the Pac-10 conference. It ended after four seasons. The conference did not have a conference tournament until it was started again in 2002.\nThe future of the Pac-12 Conference itself as with the tournament after the 2024 tournament is uncertain since the conference will only have two remaining members at the end of the 2023–24 academic year. Both the remaining Pac-12 schools are set to join the West Coast Conference as non-football affiliated members for all sports with the exception of baseball for at least the 2024–25 academic year and beyond.\nHistory.\nThe predecessor conference of the Pac-12, the Pacific Coast Conference, began playing basketball in the 1915–16 season. The PCC was split into North and South Divisions for basketball beginning with the 1922–23 season. The winners of the two divisions would play a best of three series of games to determine the PCC basketball champion. If two division teams tied, they would have a one-game playoff to produce the division representative. Starting with the first edition of the event now known as the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 1939, the winner of the PCC divisional playoff was given the automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. Oregon, the 1939 PCC champion, won the championship game in the 1939 NCAA basketball tournament.\nThe last divisional playoff was in the 1954–55 season. After that, there was no divisional play and all teams played each other in a round robin competition. From the 1955–56 season through the 1985–86 season, the regular season conference champion was awarded the NCAA tournament berth from the PCC, later AAWU, Pac-8 and Pac-10.\nBeginning with the 1975 NCAA tournament, the league (known as the Pac-8 until becoming the Pac-10 with the 1978 arrival of Arizona and Arizona State) would usually place at least one other at-large team in the tournament. Following the end of UCLA's dominance in the 1970s, the Pac-10 would struggle to get out of the early rounds of the NCAA tournament.\nBy the 1985–86 season, the Pac-10 was one of three remaining conferences that gave their automatic NCAA tournament bid to the regular season round-robin champion. The other two conferences were the Ivy League and the Big Ten Conference.\n1987–1990.\nThe modern tournament format began in 1987 as the Pacific-10 Men's basketball Tournament. The first incarnation of the tournament ran from 1987 to 1990, hosted at different school sites. UCLA was awarded the inaugural tournament, which was won by the Bruins. The Arizona Wildcats hosted the 1988 tournament and won. The Wildcats also won the 1989 and 1990 tournaments. Citing academic concerns, it was dropped after 1990 upon opposition from coaches, poor revenue, and poor attendance. The Pac-10 went back to having the regular season champion get awarded the automatic NCAA tournament bid for the 1990–2001 seasons. The Pac-10 also was viewed as weaker than East coast conferences that placed many teams in the NCAA tournament. The tournament was seen as more damaging to the conference than helpful. The NCAA selection show occurred during or immediately following the Sunday final. This meant the selection committee had to make a decision to have a placeholder for a potential team that depended upon the final result.\n2002 to the present.\nIn 1998, the Big Ten began to hold a conference tournament, leaving the Pac-10 and Ivy League the lone conferences without postseason tournaments. (The Ivy League would not begin holding its tournament until 2017.) The Pac-10 tournament was restarted by an 8–2 vote of the athletic directors of the conference in 2000 after determining that a tournament would help increase exposure of the conference and help the seeding of the schools in the NCAA tournament. Stanford University and the University of Arizona opposed the tournament, while UCLA's and USC's votes, considered the deciding votes, were swayed by permanently hosting the tournament at Staples Center. Los Angeles is the second largest media market in the United States. The championship game has been broadcast nationally by CBS Sports. The championship game was scheduled for Saturday before selection Sunday, as opposed to the previous iteration of the tournament holding the championship on Sunday after the selection committee had completed their work.\nWith the 2011 championship game attracting only 12,074 paid attendees, less than two-thirds the capacity of Staples Center, commissioner Larry Scott reopened bids from other cities to host the Pac-12 Tournament. Other models including a round-robin model and hosting the tournament at conference sites have also been considered. Ultimately, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and Seattle submitted bids for consideration.\nOn March 13, 2012, the Pac-12 Tournament was officially moved to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a three-year term. The tournament moved to T-Mobile Arena once it opened during the 2016–17 basketball season; the hosting contract between the Pac-12 and the arena ran through 2020. In October 2019, the contract was extended through 2021-2022.\nThe 2020 tournament began on March 11, and teams played the first round. It was cancelled on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no further games played. The 2021 tournament was played, but with only family of student-athletes &amp; members of the individual athletic departments as spectators in attendance.\nTelevision coverage.\nEffective with the 2012–13 season, as part of the new television contract signed with Fox Sports and ESPN, one quarterfinal game, one semifinal game, and the championship game will rotate between Fox Sports and ESPN, with ESPN obtaining odd year tournaments and Fox Sports even numbered tournaments. All other games are broadcast on the Pac-12 Network. On September 29, 2021, the Conference announced the Pac-12 Network, FOX &amp; FS1 would be the telecast providers for the 2022 Pac-12 tournament. Eight games would be featured on the Pac-12 Network, two games would be featured on FS1 &amp; the Pac-12 Tournament Title game would be featured on FOX.\nFormat.\nFrom 1987 to 1990 and 2006 to 2011, all ten teams participated in the tournament, with the top six teams receiving a bye in the opening round. Between 2002 and 2005, only the top eight teams in the conference participated in the tournament. Of the Pac-12 schools, only Washington State has never played in the championship game. In 2010 with USC on probation, only nine teams participated. Since 2012, all 12 teams have participated with the top four teams getting byes into the quarterfinals.\nResults.\nnotes: &lt;br&gt;†\" Arizona vacated 2017, 2018 titles due to NCAA penalty\"&lt;br&gt;\n^\"According to the Pac-12, family members were allowed to attend, but the general public was not allowed.

        "text": "Mark Christopher \"Ben\" Davis (born March 10, 1977), is an American former professional baseball player, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners, and Chicago White Sox, between and . Davis began his career as a promising catcher, but was the only season in which he played in more than half of his team's games. He was nicknamed \"Big Ben\", during his time with San Diego, because of his towering presence, standing tall, weighing .\nAfter returning to the Minor Leagues for several seasons, Davis converted to pitching, in . for parts of three seasons, before retiring in . He currently works as a color commentator for the Philadelphia Phillies and lives with his wife, two sons, and two daughters in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\nHigh school career.\nDavis graduated in 1995 from Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern, Pennsylvania. As a senior, he batted .514, going 36 for 70, with six home runs, and 37 RBIs. Davis was ranked as the second-best prospect in the 1995 draft, by \"Baseball America\"; that same publication tabbed him as being the Best Defensive Catcher and the high school player closest to the majors. While at Malvern Prep, Davis also played on the basketball team, where he competed against fellow Main Line-prodigy Kobe Bryant, (then) of Lower Merion High School.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Padres.\nDavis was a first-round pick, second overall, in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, by the San Diego Padres, out of Malvern Preparatory School. \"USA Today\" called him the best high school catcher since Dale Murphy, in . Davis was named to the Pioneer League All-Star team, in his first professional season, with the Advanced-Rookie Idaho Falls Braves, in .\nIn , Davis was limited to designated hitter duties, for the first month of the season, with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, due to a sore right elbow. He threw out 25 of 98 attempted base-stealers. Davis also spent the season at Rancho Cucamonga, throwing out 59 of 159 attempted base-stealers.\nThe Padres purchased Davis' contract from the Double-A Mobile BayBears on September 19, 1998. He made his Major League debut, as a defensive replacement, on September 25, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Davis reached on an error, in his first and only at-bat of the season. He was named to the Southern League All-Star team, that season, his first with Mobile. Davis threw out 47 of 83 attempted base-stealers.\nDavis spent the majority of the season with the Padres. He started 71 of 93 games for San Diego, after being recalled, on June 23. Davis collected his first major league hit, on June 26, against the Colorado Rockies, a single off Mark Brownson. He posted his first career four-hit game, on September 15, against the Atlanta Braves, including a solo home run off John Smoltz.\nDavis split the season between the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s and San Diego. He began the season with the Padres, appearing in seven games, before being optioned to Las Vegas, on April 20. Davis was recalled, on July 8. He was placed on the disabled list, in August, with a strained left oblique muscle.\nIn a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 26, 2001, starting pitcher Curt Schilling took a perfect game into the eighth inning against the Padres, when, with one out and the Diamondbacks leading by a score of 2–0, Davis laid down a successful drag bunt single, to second baseman Jay Bell. After Davis reached base, many of the Diamondbacks' players shouted obscenities at him for supposedly breaking baseball's unwritten rules. After the game, Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly called Davis's play \"chickenshit\".\nSeattle Mariners.\nIn December , Davis was traded, along with Wascar Serrano and Alex Arias, to the Seattle Mariners, in exchange for Brett Tomko, Tom Lampkin, and Ramón Vázquez. This trade, in large, disappointed the Padres organization and fanbase, because of their continuing failures to produce \"home-grown\" talent. Davis was a highly regarded top prospect.\nDavis had a .998 fielding percentage, in 77 games behind the plate, and threw out 44 percent of would be base-stealers, in . He batted .300 with runners in scoring position, and was 6-for-11, with two home runs, with the bases loaded. Davis also hit .294, with six home runs, on the road, as opposed to .216, with one home run, at home. He batted .294, in the second half of the season, raising his average from .216, at the break, to .259, at the end of the season. All seven of Davis' home runs came from the left side of the plate. He hit his first American League (AL) home run, and first homer of the season, May 4, against the New York Yankees, at Yankee Stadium. Davis had a nine-game hitting streak, from May 17 to June 6, going 13-for-29, during that span. He hit his first triple of season, on August 4, against the Cleveland Indians.\nDavis spent his second season with the Mariners in a platoon with fellow backstop Dan Wilson, in . Davis appeared in 80 games, hitting .236, with six home runs, and 42 RBIs. He hit a go-ahead home run off Ricardo Rincón, to lead off the 11th inning, April 3, against the Oakland Athletics. Davis also tied a club record, with three doubles, on June 21, against his former team, the Padres.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn June 27, 2004, Davis was once again traded, this time from the Mariners to the Chicago White Sox with Freddy García, in exchange for catcher Miguel Olivo, Mike Morse, and Jeremy Reed.\nDavis appeared in just ten games with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights, before being placed on the disabled list, with a fractured finger, on his right hand. He also fought through a right elbow injury and missed the remainder of the season, after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Davis had batted .242, with one home run, and three RBIs, before the injury. He was released after the season.\nNew York Yankees.\nFor the season, after signing with the New York Yankees, Davis played for the Columbus Clippers, their Triple-A affiliate and the Class-A Advanced Tampa Yankees. He went 3-for-16, with a double, home run, and two RBIs, for Tampa. Davis played in 48 games, with Columbus, hitting .222, with six doubles, four home runs, and 20 RBIs. On January 12, 2007, he was re-signed by the Yankees, and was invited to spring training.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nDavis was released by the Yankees, on April 1, 2007. In May , he joined the independent Camden Riversharks and played well enough that he was signed to a minor league contract by the Los Angeles Dodgers, in June. Davis was assigned to their Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, the team he had previously played for when they were San Diego's affiliate. He hit .331, with six doubles, three triples, three home runs, and 19 RBIs, in 36 games with Camden and played in 36 games with Las Vegas, batting .218, with four doubles, a home run, and 11 RBIs.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nIn January , Davis was signed by the Baltimore Orioles, to a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the team coming out of spring training and was assigned to the Double-A Bowie Baysox. Davis received a mid-season promotion to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. In 24 games with Bowie, he hit .227, with six doubles, a triple, two home runs, and 13 RBIs; with Norfolk, Davis hit .172, with two doubles, a home run, and two RBIs, in 20 games. He was released, on June 14.\nCincinnati Reds.\nAfter being released by Baltimore, Davis returned to the River Sharks, as a pitcher, in an attempt to make a comeback that might once again result in a Major League hitch. In November 2008, he signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds, as a pitcher. Davis made his Reds' organization pitching debut on April 23, against the Charlotte Stone Crabs, tossing a scoreless inning, allowing no hits, and striking out one. He injured himself on May 17, and did not return that season. Davis' statistical totals for the season included a win-loss record of 0-1, with a 3.09 ERA, and four saves, in nine games.\nCamden Riversharks.\nDavis pitched for the Camden Riversharks in , going 5-11, with a 4.61 ERA, and 28 game appearances, 23-of-which were games started. He announced his retirement from professional baseball, on April 16, 2011.\nMedia career.\nSoon after his retirement, Davis began working for NBC Sports Philadelphia (formerly Comcast Sports Network/CSN), where he began work as an analyst for the Phillies Focus show, as well as Phillies Post Game Live. For the season, Davis joined the Phillies' broadcast team as an in-game analyst. He works alongside play-by-play announcer Tom McCarthy and at times color commentators John Kruk, Jimmy Rollins, and Rubén Amaro Jr. Davis has also made regular appearances on 94 WIP Sports Radio as a co-host, in various time slots."

        "text": "Larry Jones (born September 22, 1942) is an American former professional basketball player. He most notably played in the American Basketball Association (ABA), where he was the first player to reach 5,000 career points. He also had shorter stints in the rival National Basketball Association (NBA).\nCollege career.\nJones only started playing regularly for East High in Columbus, Ohio, during his senior year. As a 6'2 forward he wasn't considered big enough by major colleges and was recruited by the University of Toledo for whom he played in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) from 1960.\nHe was repositioned as a guard by Toledo coach Ed Melvin and became a major player for the Rockets.\nJones was a unanimous selection in the 1962 All-MAC First Team chosen by the conference's coaches, having made the Second Team a year earlier.\nHe injured his wrist in Toledo's season opener against Butler on 1 December 1962 after a heavy fall where he also hit his head. Jones, who scored 35 points in the game, managed to play the last five minutes of the game with what was thought to be a sprained wrist. It later emerged the wrist was fractured and he had to redshirt the rest of the 1962–63 season. His eligibility was then extended for another season.\nOne year later, in December 1963, he helped Toledo score a \"monumental upset\" over New York University (at the time ranked second nationally). His coach Melvin described him as a \"tremendous total player – rebounder, playmaker, scorer and defender\" for his form that season after he averaged over 27 points the four previous games.\nJones, the Toledo captain and all-time second highest scorer, suffered a fractured knuckle on 13 January 1964 when he fell on ice after a practice. Before he could return from injury, he was suspended in early February for undisclosed disciplinary reasons.\nIt later emerged that he had been involved in a paternity suit. However all charges were dropped, his name was cleared and he was reinstated in early March, allowing him to play the final two games of the season.\nHe was an honorable mention All-American in the 1964 Newspaper Enterprise Association selection.\nProfessional career.\nEarly career (1964–1967).\nJones was first drafted by the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers with a fifth round pick (43rd overall) in the 1963 NBA draft, however he played another college season instead of turning professional.(see College career).\nHe then re-entered the 1964 NBA draft where he was chosen in the third round (20th overall pick) by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nDuring the 1964–65 season he was sent by the Sixers to the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League where he averaged 20 points per game. He was recalled to Philadelphia on 2 March 1965 due to injuries to backcourt players. At the end of an NBA season where he had averaged 5.7 points in 23 games, Jones was released.\nFollowing his release, Jones played from 1965 to 1967 in the Eastern League, again with Wilkes-Barre. He was part of the Baltimore Bullets pre-season squad but was released in October 1966 and returned to the Barons.\nDenver Rockets (1967–1970).\nWhen the American Basketball Association was created in 1967, Jones called and wrote to every team in the league, the Denver Rockets were the only one to answer. He signed a $10,000 contract with the Rockets, the Eastern League disputed it and he had to stay in the team plane during his first game in Pittsburgh to avoid a subpoena.\nThanks to his excellent jump-shooting, Jones became a major player for Denver and the ABA in general, making three consecutive All-ABA First Teams from 1967 to 1970. He scored 30 points or more in 23 consecutive games during the 1968–69 ABA season. This included 52 points in a 133–123 win over the Houston Mavericks on 21 March 1969 which equalled his own club record. During this match he became the first ABA player to score over 2,000 points in a season. He finished the regular season with a league-leading 2,133 points as Denver lost in the playoffs first round to the Oakland Oaks.\nJones reached 5,000 career ABA points on 15 January 1970, becoming the first player in the league to do so. He scored 23 points against the Dallas Chaparrals to reach the mark, including two free-throws at the end of the game to secure the win for Denver. During the 1969–70 season he averaged 24.9 points in the regular season and 26.6 during the playoffs as the Rockets lost in the West finals. \nHe was the top scorer of the 1970 ABA All-Star Game with 30 points, adding 6 rebounds and 5 assists. As the ABA Players' Association (ABAPA) President, Jones and the ABAPA threatened to sit out the game if the association was not recognized by ABA owners. They eventually arrived at the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum at 1:39 pm, only twenty minutes before the game start.\nDespite his tally, Jones was pipped to the All-Star Game MVP award (and assorted prizes such as a one-year Dodge Challenger lease) by Denver teammate Spencer Haywood.\nThis reflected Denver's payroll where Jones was replaced as the Rockets' highest-paid player by Haywood, a rookie, when he signed in 1969. In fact Haywood's $1.9 million contract (which included a $50,000 signing bonus) dwarfed Jones' $23,000 per year. Though Haywood left for the NBA after one season (as his contract deferred most of his salary for decades), Jones wasn't offered a revalued contract. He protested (once wearing a \"railroad suit, claiming that was all he could afford\") and obtained a trade to another team.\nJones was traded to the Floridians in June 1970 when Denver sent him, Greg Wittman and a No. 2 draft pick to the Floridians in exchange for Don Sidle, Larry Cannon and a No. 1 draft pick.\nHis Denver career ended with averages of 25.4 points and 4.2 assists in 226 regular-season games and 25.1 points and 5.6 assists in 20 playoff games.\nLater ABA career (1970–1973).\nJones joined the Floridians as they replaced their entire squad after finishing the 1969–70 season with a 23–61 record. Jones and teammate Mack Calvin contributed a 51.5 point average during the 1970–71 season which was the highest scoring backcourt ever in professional basketball. \nHe averaged over 20 points for the Floridians over two seasons in which they reached the playoffs.\nHowever the club struggled with attendances and the first round playoff loss to the Virginia Squires on 6 April 1972 was their final game.\nThe ABA bought the club and folded it, organising a dispersal draft in June where the four worst ABA teams had the first picks on Floridians and Pittsburgh Condors players. The Utah Stars selected Jones with the third pick.\nJones did not fit in at Utah, where he was the No. 4 guard as the team had many shooters and he was said to be weak on defense and team play. He left the team in December as he was exchanged for Bob Warren in a straight swap with the Dallas Chaparrals. \nHe reached 10,000 career ABA points during an 11 February 1973 game against the San Diego Conquistadors, becoming the fourth ABA player to reach the milestone during the season. He contributed a season-best 30 points, including a layup six seconds from time that helped claim an overtime 115–113 win for the Chaparrals.\nAt the end of the season Jones was placed on waivers by the Chaparrals and was not claimed by another club. It was speculated that his tenure of the head of the Players' Association discouraged clubs from signing the former all-time ABA scoring leader. He claimed no ABA team even called him to make a lower salary offer.\nNBA return and retirement (1973–1975).\nHaving considered ending his professional career to finish a doctorate in counseling, Jones was offered a lifeline by Gene Shue, coach of his former NBA team Philadelphia, who signed him for the Sixers. The Sixers had finished the previous season with a 9–73 record, the worst in the history of the NBA. Hoping to prove those who considered him \"over the hill\" wrong, Jones contributed double figure scoring while starting eight of ten games between November and December as the Sixers won five times to reach a 9–15 record. This included 20 points in a 108–106 overtime win over the Houston Rockets and an NBA career-best 22 in a 20 November win over the Kansas City-Omaha Kings. \nHe finished the 1973–74 NBA season averaging 10 points per game, following which he was released by the Sixers in October 1974.\nIn November, he participated in the European Professional Basketball League (EPBL) draft with other free agents. He was signed by the Munich Eagles to both play for and coach the Germany-based club.\nHe was one of the best players in the league, averaging 23 points (second best for the league) and a league-topping 7 assists per game when the season prematurely ended in March after 30 games.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his first coaching experience in the EPBL, Jones was hired by another former European coach, Herb Brown, when he joined the Detroit Pistons in 1976. He served as assistant coach with the Pistons for two NBA seasons, keeping his post when Brown was fired in 1977. He was not retained for the 1978–79 season after incoming coach Dick Vitale hired other assistants such as long-time friend Richie Adubato.\nJones was then the head coach of the Las Vegas Dealers of the Western Basketball Association during its inaugural 1978–79 season following which the unstable league folded.\nJones next served as director of player personnel for the Women's Professional Basketball League until the league folded in 1981.\nHis following position was also in women's basketball, coaching his hometown team, the Columbus Minks, in the Women's American Basketball Association (WABA). \nThe WABA played its only season from October to November 1984, its last game before folding was the All-Star Game on December 16 where Jones coached the All-Star team against champions Dallas Diamonds.\nPersonal.\nAfter his playing career, Jones worked as a state corrections official in Columbus.\nMarried with two daughters and one son, he conducts free summer basketball camps for youngsters in his hometown. He credits his high school coach Jackie Moore for helping him \"go from a poor student to an honor student\" and wants to follow his example in helping youths.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA/ABA.\nSource\nRegular season.\n!

        "text": "NHL Stanley Cup, known as Super Hockey in Europe, is an ice hockey video game developed by Sculptured Software for the Super NES. Unlike most hockey video games of the time, the game features movement in a pseudo-3D environment using the SNES's Mode 7 hardware feature, similar to Sculptured's previous \"NCAA Basketball\".\nGameplay.\n\"Nintendo NHL Stanley Cup\" lets all 26 teams from the National Hockey League at the time of the game's release (including the expansion Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) compete for the highest honor in professional hockey, the Stanley Cup. As it licenses from the NHL, but not the NHLPA, the game can use the team logos and the Stanley Cup but not the names of real players. Despite this, the players have strengths and weaknesses that correspond to their real-life counterparts, so e.g. Pittsburgh Penguins #66 or Los Angeles Kings #99 have an easier time scoring. The player can substitute for or pull his goalie and institute line changes, but not line edits, as he sees fit. Gameplay modes consist of Exhibition, Season and Best of Seven Series. Options include three different period lengths (5, 10 or 20 minutes) and having the penalties and line changes turned on or off.\nThis game mimics real ice hockey in that the player can shoot, pass or dump the puck, and he can perform hip, shoulder and poke checks. The player can even fake a slap shot and aim his shot on goal to a particular corner of the net. There are numerous penalties that the player can commit, including tripping, cross checking, slashing, roughing, hooking, interference, icing and offsides. The player on offense could exploit a tactic of dumping the puck over the goalie's head, thereby creating an indefensible shot.\nA special Mode 7 viewpoint gives the player a three-dimensional perspective that helps to keep him focused on the puck, the center ice and the surrounding action. Battery backup lets the player save the player's progress throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. Other features include season and game statistics, three difficulty levels (Junior, NHL and NHL Pro), and the ability to skip games against particular opponents. At the end of each period and after the game, a sportscaster will give the player a summary of the action."

        "title": "Mike Green (ice hockey, born 1985)",
        "text": "Michael David Green (born October 12, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings and Edmonton Oilers.\nKnown for his hard slapshot and goal-scoring offense during his ten-year tenure with the Capitals, Green put up impressive offensive statistics for a defenceman from 2007 to 2010. During this time, he earned the nickname \"Game Over Green\" for his propensity to score game-winning goals.\nPlaying career.\nMinor.\nGreen played his minor hockey career with the NASA Hockey Association, in Calgary, Alberta. He played major junior in the Western Hockey League (WHL) for five full seasons with the Saskatoon Blades. After a 14-goal, 39-point season in 2003–04, he was drafted in the first round, 29th overall, by the Washington Capitals in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.\nWashington Capitals.\nIn 2005–06, Green split the season with the Capitals and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears. He scored his first career NHL goal against Ed Belfour of the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 3, 2006, and finished with three points in 22 games for the Capitals. The next season, 2006–07, Green was selected to play in the 2007 NHL YoungStars Game for the Eastern Conference, where he registered three assists despite playing with a bruised foot. Not having played the 25-game minimum to qualify as a rookie the previous season, the 2006–07 season counted as Green's rookie campaign. He completed his second season with 12 points in 70 games, while still appearing in 12 games in the AHL with the Bears.\nIn 2007–08, Green emerged as an elite offensive NHL defenceman while playing on a young and talented Washington team which included forwards Alexander Ovechkin, Alexander Semin and Nicklas Bäckström. Green earned the nickname \"Game Over,\" made popular by play-by-play announcer Joe Beninati after his game-winning goals in the last minutes of the third period or overtime became a regular occurrence. Green finished the season with four game-winning goals to go with his NHL-leading 18 goals among defencemen and 56 points. Green did not start his goal-scoring run until after Bruce Boudreau replaced Glen Hanlon as head coach on Thanksgiving Day, 2007. That season, the Capitals made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 2003, and in his first career NHL playoff game on April 11, 2008, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Green brought Washington back from a 4–2 deficit with two goals in the third period. The Capitals eventually won the game on an Ovechkin game-winning goal. Known for his very powerful and heavy shot, Green took a slapshot from the blue line that same game that was blocked by Philadelphia's Patrick Thoresen; the shot broke Thoresen's protective cup and nearly ruptured a testicle, and he had to be taken to a local hospital, missing the next game. After the game, Green called Thoresen to check in on him. In Game 3, on April 15, Green recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick (a goal, an assist and a fight) in a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. The series went the distance, but the Capitals would lose in the seventh game.\nDuring the 2008 playoffs, Green's signature \"faux hawk\" hairstyle received increased publicity as his profile in the NHL was raised. An \"Elliot in the Morning\" promotion, \"Rawk the Hawk,\" had Green into the studio for the haircut, which willing fans could also have done for playoff tickets. The D.C. morning talk radio show brought this promotion back for the 2009 season, offering tickets for the first game of each new series. Additionally, during the season, an unofficial Green fan club, dubbed the \"Gang Green\" began showing up to home games wearing dark green T-shirts with \"Gang Green\" written on the front and Green's nickname, \"GAME OVER,\" as the name plate on the back above the number 52.\nAt the end of the season, on May 21, 2008, Green was named to the \"Sporting News\"' NHL All-Star team along with teammate Alexander Ovechkin. Later in the summer, Green signed a four-year contract extension with the Capitals, on July 1, averaging to $5.25 million per year.\nGreen picked up where he left off in 2008–09, but was plagued by injuries early in the season. Returning from the sidelines, Green captured back-to-back NHL Third Stars of the Week for the weeks ending February 1 and 8, 2009. On February 14, Green scored in his eighth consecutive game, setting the NHL record for most consecutive games with a goal by a defenceman. The former record was set by Mike O'Connell in the 1983–84 season. Then, after receiving a Second Star of the Week for the week ending March 23, he became just the eighth defenceman in history to score 30 goals in a season in a game against the New York Islanders on April 1. Finishing with 31 goals on the season, Green tallied 18 on the power play, one short of Sheldon Souray's 2006–07 record of 19.\nIn April 2009, Green was nominated for the James Norris Memorial Trophy for the NHL's top defenceman, along with Zdeno Chára and Nicklas Lidström. Green has been nominated for the award twice.\nIn 2009–10, Green set a career-high with 76 points. He missed a lot of time during the following two seasons due to various injuries.\nOn July 16, 2012, Green signed a three-year contract extension worth $18.25 million to stay with the Capitals.\nIn the 2012–13 NHL season, Green led all NHL defencemen in goals scored with 12.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Green was demoted to Washington's second power play unit. The emergence of John Carlson led to less ice time for “Game Over Green”.\nIn the 2014-15 season, Green played bottom pairing minutes mainly alongside defensive partner Nate Schmidt. Green periodically got more ice time on the first power play unit and was able to have a respectable offensive season with 45 points. Still a far-cry from his output in previous years, Green played an integral role in the capitals playoff run with the services of Dmitry Orlov being unavailable for the entire season.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nOn July 1, 2015, the Detroit Red Wings signed Green to a three-year, $18 million contract.\nOn October 17, 2016, Green notched his first career hat trick against Andrew Hammond of the Ottawa Senators.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Green was named to the NHL All-Star Game for the second time in his career after leading team defencemen in scoring and ranking fourth overall on the team. Green's season was cut short in March when he was ruled out for the rest of the season due to his injuries.\nOn June 30, 2018, the Red Wings resigned Green to a two-year, $10.75 million contract. After playing in 43 games the following season, Green was announced to be sitting out the rest of the year to recover from a virus on March 7, 2019. During the 2019–20 season, Green recorded three goals and eights assists in 48 games for the Red Wings.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nOn February 24, 2020, Green was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Kyle Brodziak and a conditional fourth-round pick in 2020. He skated in two games for the team before suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL).\nGreen decided to opt out of the league's return to play program after the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020, Green announced his retirement in an interview with The Athletic.\nInternational play.\nFollowing his break-out season with the Capitals, Green debuted for Team Canada at the 2008 IIHF World Championship as the host country. He recorded 12 points in eight games as Canada went on to win a silver medal, losing to Russia in overtime in the gold medal game. Green was named to the tournament All-Star team. He was also selected for the 2010 Winter Olympics summer roster for Team Canada in August 2009 and considered a favourite, but did not make the final roster cut.\nOff the ice.\nGreen is involved in a number of community organizations and events. He is raising money for Children's National Medical Center as part of America's Giving Challenge, sponsored by Parade magazine. He also participated with Alexander Ovechkin in speaking at a local middle school and participating in a game of floor hockey. Green also has a program called \"Green's Gang,\" where he purchases seven season tickets and donates them to Most Valuable Kids, a non-profit organization that works with underprivileged kids and active military.\nIn 2008, Green founded a charity called So Kids Can with Elliot Segal, host of DC101's \"Elliot in the Morning\". During the 2011–12 season, the group raised money to construct a playground at Hopkins-Tancil Court in Old Town Alexandria (Virginia). Working with KaBOOM!, a national non-profit dedicated to building playgrounds, the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority, and over 200 Washington Capitals fans and community volunteers, Green and Segal oversaw the construction of that playground. The S.T.A.R.S playground held its official opening on September 19, 2012. So Kids Can has raised over $200,000 since its founding. On August 9, 2014, Green married his longtime girlfriend, Courtney Parrie and the couple have three children together."

He also played for the New York Rangers and St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, Dinamo Riga, HC Donbass of the Kontinental Hockey League and Orli Znojmo of the Austrian Hockey League.\nPlaying career.\nHolt was drafted 180th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. Holt was first called up from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (AHL) in December 2005 as backup to Henrik Lundqvist while starting goalie Kevin Weekes was injured. He played just over 10 minutes in one game, not allowing a goal becoming the first former Billings Bulls player to play in the NHL. He was sent back down to Hartford but was recalled to the Rangers on February 23, 2006.\nOn October 30, 2008, Holt was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Blues after playing two games for their affiliate the Peoria Rivermen. On October 31, Holt was called up to the Blues on emergency before returning to Peoria. He was again recalled by the Blues on February 6, 2009. He made his first appearance for the Blues, and only his second appearance in the NHL on February 18, 2009 as a replacement for Chris Mason after Mason started the first two periods against the Columbus Blue Jackets, totaling 19 min., giving up no goals on three shots.\nIn September 2009, prior to the 2009–10 season, he attended the Ottawa Senators training camp. He was demoted to the Binghamton Senators organization which demoted him to the Elmira Jackals on September 30. He was promoted to Binghamton in March 2010.

The Club currently plays at TG Millner Field. On 25 November 2020, the Club announced that it had secured approval for its new home ground at the Old Pony Club in Fred Caterson Reserve, Gilbert Rd Castle Hill \nClub history.\nRugby has been played in the Northern Districts of Sydney since the latter part of the 19th century. In the 1890s a number of local sides existed, playing at a variety of venues, the main one being Brush Farm in Eastwood. Interestingly, a Rugby Union Club was also formed in Castle Hill around this time (in 1894) and they also played in Blue and White\nWith the outbreak of the Great War, senior rugby was suspended with many of the players enlisting, a number paying the supreme sacrifice.\nFollowing W.W.1, the strength of Rugby in Eastwood and in Epping was centred around the respective Young Men's Institutes which fielded junior and senior sides in the Suburban Competition. At this time, Epping played at Epping Oval and Eastwood played at Eastwood Oval. Epping won the Kentwell Cup in 1926 and Eastwood won the Burke Cup in 1927.\nFollowing further success in the 1930s, momentum was building to seek admission into the District Competition. The outbreak of the Second World War caused a deferral of this plan until 1946 when a successful application was made for inclusion in the District Competition from the beginning of the 1947 Season. This was following the amalgamation of the Eastwood and Epping Clubs. As a result, the Eastwood District Rugby Union Football Club was formed and it has played in the Sydney District Competition ever since. Initially the new club's home ground was the Top Oval in Eastwood. In 1963, EDRUFC moved its home ground to TG Millner at Marsfield.\nThe Club has won a number of minor grade and Colts competitions over the years but did not win the 1st-grade major premiership trophy until 1999. In an historic win, the Club won the Shute Shield for the first time by defeating Sydney University in the Grand Final.\nSince formation, the Club has produced numerous players who have played International rugby.

        "text": "The 2006 NBA Finals was the championship series of the 2005–06 NBA season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Dallas Mavericks were favored to win the championship over the Miami Heat. Despite these odds, the Heat won the title in six games over the Mavericks, becoming the third team—after the 1969 Celtics, the 1977 Trail Blazers and later the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers and 2021 Milwaukee Bucks—to win a championship after trailing 0–2 in the series. Dwyane Wade of the Heat was named Most Valuable Player of the series.\nThe series featured two teams who had never previously appeared in the Finals for the first time since , and it was consequently the first Finals since where neither team had previously won an NBA title. The next Finals appearance for both franchises would come five years later in , with the Mavericks winning the rematch over the Heat.\nThis was the second NBA Finals match-up of teams from Florida and Texas, after the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic contested the 1995 NBA Finals. Until the Miami Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals, it was the last Finals loss by a team from Texas (Houston lost in 1981 and 1986) versus eight Finals victories (five by San Antonio, two by Houston, and one by Dallas) including the Spurs in 2007 and the Mavericks in 2011. This was the only Finals of the 2000s not to involve the Los Angeles Lakers or the San Antonio Spurs, and the first since 1995 not to feature either Phil Jackson or Gregg Popovich as head coach. It was also the first Finals where the same company (American Airlines) owned the naming rights to both home arenas; however, the Miami arena is now known as the Kaseya Center.\nBackground.\nThe Miami Heat joined the league in the 1988–89 season, but they did not rise to prominence until they hired Pat Riley to be their head coach and president before the 1995–96 season. In Riley's first stint, the Heat were playoff regulars between 1996 and 2001, however, the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks always thwarted Miami's dreams of a championship or even a Finals berth. However, when the team drafted Dwyane Wade fifth overall in 2003, things started to look up for the Heat. They went 42-40 under interim coach Stan Van Gundy, making the playoffs after a 2-year hiatus. They defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round, but they ultimately fell to the Pacers in 6 games. The 2004 offseason saw the addition of Shaquille O'Neal, and with Wade and O'Neal performing well, the Heat won 59 games in the 2004–05 season, as they took the defending champions Detroit Pistons to seven games in the conference finals. The following season, after an early 11–10 start, Van Gundy resigned and Riley returned to coaching. Though injuries and lack of chemistry hobbled the Heat initially, they still managed to win 52 games that season. After a culmination of harmony and momentum came together just before the playoffs, they started their postseason run by defeating the Bulls in six games, then eliminated the New Jersey Nets in five games, and then ousted the 64-win 4 all-star Pistons in six games to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.\nRegular-season series.\nThe Dallas Mavericks won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nThe Heat became the second team since 1985 to sweep the middle three games at home, the 2004 Detroit Pistons being the first. In 1985 the NBA switched the Finals to the 2-3-2 format, which was changed back to the 2-2-1-1-1 format for the 2014 NBA Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nDallas' Jason Terry scored a playoff-high 32 points as the Mavericks overcame a 31–23 deficit at the end of the first quarter.\nGame 2.\nDirk Nowitzki had a stellar 30 point and 12 rebound performance, and the Mavericks cruised past the Heat to take a 2–0 series lead.\nGame 3.\nLed by Dwyane Wade's 42 points and 13 rebounds, the Heat rallied from a 13-point deficit with six minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The momentum-changing comeback was capped by a Gary Payton field goal from just inside the three-point line with 9.3 seconds left. Dirk Nowitzki had a chance to tie the game at the free throw line with 3.4 seconds to go, but missed 1 of 2, sealing the win for Miami.\nGame 4.\nDwyane Wade shined again for the Heat with 36 points, and Miami held Dallas to just seven points in the fourth quarter en route to a series-tying, blowout victory. The Mavericks' fourth quarter was the lowest ever by any team during the NBA Finals. Jerry Stackhouse caught Shaquille O'Neal with a flagrant foul that resulted in his suspension for Game 5. Stackhouse was the final NBA player to be suspended in the NBA Finals until Draymond Green was suspended in the 2016 NBA Finals.\nGame 5.\nDwyane Wade shot 25 free throws - as many free throws as all the Mavericks combined (a fact that did not sit well with Mavericks head coach Avery Johnson), leading the Heat to their third straight win over Dallas after being down 0–2 in the series.\nWith 9.1 seconds left in overtime and the Heat trailing by 1 point, they inbounded the ball to Wade, who caught the ball in the air and then landed in the backcourt. Mavericks' team owner Mark Cuban felt Wade had therefore committed a backcourt violation after receiving the ball.\nDallas was then penalized with a controversial foul call that sent Wade to the line to shoot the go-ahead free throws with 1.9 seconds left on the overtime game clock. Wade hit the first free throw, and Dallas Mavericks coach Avery Johnson signaled to his team to call a timeout after Wade's second attempt. Josh Howard then made a timeout gesture with his hands and began to walk off the floor, and the referees called the Mavericks' last remaining timeout, which prevented them from advancing the ball after the second attempt if Wade converted. After the timeout, Wade made the second free throw to give his team a one-point lead, after which Devin Harris missed a Hail Mary half-court shot as time expired. Wade finished the game with 43 points while setting an NBA Finals record for most made free throws in a game with 21. Shaquille O'Neal added a double-double with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Miami converted 32 of its 49 attempts from the free throw line.\nJason Terry led Dallas with 35 points in a losing effort, while Howard added 25. After the game, a frustrated Dirk Nowitzki kicked a ball into the stands and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban caused many \"acts of misconduct\" resulting in fines of $5,000 and $250,000, respectively, for the two men.\nGame 6.\nBehind Dwyane Wade's 36 points, Miami rallied from a 14-point first half deficit to edge Dallas and win their first championship in franchise history as Jason Terry missed a critical 3-pointer that would've sent the game to overtime. Averaging 34.7 points per game in the championship series, Wade was named NBA Finals MVP (Most Valuable Player).\nBroadcasting.\nABC had exclusive rights to televise the NBA Finals in the United States. Play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and color commentator Hubie Brown called the action, with courtside reporting by Lisa Salters and Stuart Scott. Radio counterpart ESPN Radio broadcast the Finals, with Jim Durham and Dr. Jack Ramsay calling the action. The featured song, aired throughout the playoffs, was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' \"Runnin' Down a Dream.\"\nThis marked the first of 18 consecutive NBA Finals called by Breen, currently the most among NBA play-by-play voices; the only games he would not call during this period was Games 1 and 2 of the 2022 NBA Finals, when Mark Jones took over due to Breen's quarantine as a result of COVID-19. However, it was the only NBA Finals to feature Breen with Hubie Brown. The following season, Brown slid down to ESPN's secondary team with Mike Tirico (the pair would also call ESPN Radio's NBA Finals broadcasts that season), while Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy (the latter after his dismissal as Houston Rockets head coach) joined Breen on the lead team.\nGame 2 of the Finals, which took place the same evening as the 60th Tony Awards, was the most-watched program of June 11, 2006. ABC won the night with 3.5 rating and 10 share, CBS came in fourth with a 1.5/4 for the Tonys. On June 20, Game 6 had a 4.4/13 among viewers aged 18–49.\nThe finals were shown on Sky Sports in the UK and Ireland.\nAftermath.\nThe Mavericks would post the league's best record with 67 victories in the 2006–07 NBA season but were ousted by the eight-seeded Golden State Warriors in a six-game first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The Mavs' playoff defeat marked the first time a top seed was eliminated in a seven-game first round series since it was implemented in 2003. Still, Dirk Nowitzki was named the regular season MVP at season's end. After another playoff loss to the New Orleans Hornets in 2008, in which the Mavericks brought back Jason Kidd, head coach Avery Johnson was fired and replaced by Rick Carlisle. After another two early playoff exits, the Mavericks won 57 games in the 2010–11 season and returned to the Finals.\nThe Heat would lose convincingly by 42 points to the Chicago Bulls in the opening night of the 2006–07 season, the worst opening-day margin of defeat for a defending champion in NBA history. Injuries would keep the team from surpassing or even equaling last season's total, yet they still won the Southeast Division despite winning only 44 games. The Bulls would oust them in a four-game sweep in the first round of the playoffs, the first such occurrence since 1957. The following year, Miami completed its two-year turnaround from NBA champion to the NBA's worst team by winning only 15 games, equaling the mark set by the team in their inaugural season, which saw Shaquille O'Neal traded to the Phoenix Suns in mid-season and Dwyane Wade missing 31 games. The Heat gradually climbed back to contention in the Erik Spoelstra era, culminating in the much-publicized free-agent acquisitions of LeBron James and Chris Bosh. The Heat won 58 games in the 2010–11 season, and along with the Mavericks, returned to the Finals in 2011.\nThe 2011 NBA Finals, which was a rematch of 2006, saw the Mavericks win in six games after trailing 2–1 in the Finals. It was the Mavericks' first NBA championship, as well as both teams' second appearances in the Finals. Dirk Nowitzki was named Finals MVP. Like the Heat in 2006, the Mavericks experienced a post-championship letdown, getting swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the opening round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, and then missed the postseason entirely in .\n, this was Miami's fifth championship out of a total of seven among the Big Four sports leagues; the MLB's National League Florida (now Miami) Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and 2003 while the NFL's Miami Dolphins won the Super Bowl in 1973 and 1974. The Miami Heat would go on to win a second championship in 2012 against the Thunder in 5 games and a third championship in 2013 against the San Antonio Spurs in 7 games before falling in 2014 against the same Spurs team in 5 games.\nThis was the second \"Big Four\" postseason game or series to pit a team from Miami against a team from Dallas. In 1971, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Dolphins to claim their first of five Super Bowls. As of 2020, the city's NHL teams, the Stars and Panthers, have not met in the playoffs, as are their MLB counterparts the Rangers and Marlins."

        "title": "Paul Blair (baseball)",
        "text": "Paul L. D. Blair (February 1, 1944 – December 26, 2013) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from through , most notably as the center fielder for the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. He also played for the New York Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds.\nA two-time All-Star player, Blair excelled as a defensive player, winning the Gold Glove Award eight times, including seven consecutive years from to . One of the best defensive outfielders of his era, he had excellent range and was brilliant at tracking fly balls. He challenged hitters by playing shallow, then running down balls hit over his head. In 1984, Blair was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nBlair was born in Cushing, Oklahoma but grew up in Los Angeles where he attended Manual Arts High School. An accomplished athlete, he played basketball, baseball and ran track while a student. Blair was originally signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in . After spending the season in their farm system, he was selected by the Orioles in the 1962 first-year draft on November 26, 1962.\nMajor league career.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nHe broke into the Orioles' lineup in and, despite hitting only .234 with five home runs and 25 runs batted in, impressed many with his defensive skills. In he batted .277 on an Orioles team that won the World Series. In Games 3 and 4 of that series, which the Frank Robinson-led Orioles swept from the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers in four games, Blair played a major role in 1–0 shutouts by Wally Bunker and Dave McNally respectively, hitting a 430-foot home run off Claude Osteen in Game 3, and robbing Jim Lefebvre of an eighth-inning home run that would have tied Game 4. Blair also caught Lou Johnson's fly ball for the final out of the Series.\nIn Blair established a career high .293 batting average with 11 home runs and 64 RBIs, along with an American League-leading 12 triples. He also won the first of his eight Gold Glove Awards. After slumping to .211 in , Blair had perhaps his best season in . Batting second behind Don Buford in the Orioles' lineup, he hit .285 with career highs in home runs (26), runs batted in (76) and runs (102). His 26 homers along with 20 stolen bases made him the first Orioles player to achieve at least 20 in each category in the same season. He also made the All-Star team for the first time; he would repeat this feat in . His Orioles won the pennant, with Blair becoming the first player to have 5 hits in a post-season game, with 5 hits in 6 at-bats against the Minnesota Twins on October 6. The Orioles lost to the Miracle Mets in the World Series. Blair went 2-for-20 in that Series, including being the victim of one of Tommie Agee's two spectacular catches in Game 3 (Agee had also robbed Elrod Hendricks earlier in the game). On that Agee catch, Blair was the first batter Nolan Ryan faced in a World Series—the only World Series game the Hall of Fame pitcher would participate in. One of Blair's two hits came in the seventh inning of Game 2; it broke up Jerry Koosman's bid for a no-hitter.\nBlair was beaned by Ken Tatum in the eighth inning of a 6–1 loss to the California Angels at Anaheim Stadium on May 31, 1970. He sustained a broken nose, orbital floor fractures below his left eye and a broken cheekbone. The beaning was unintentional, as Tatum had grazed the jersey front of the previous batter Boog Powell. Blair returned to the starting lineup three weeks later, finishing the season batting .267. After going 1 for 13 in the American League Championship Series, he had the World Series' highest batting average and on-base percentage with .474 and .524 respectively and shared with Series MVP Brooks Robinson the five-game Fall Classic record with nine hits apiece. Jim Palmer wrote that \"ever since he got hit by a pitch, he isn't the hitter he was.\"\nIn Blair took up switch-hitting but stopped after batting only .193 (11-for-57). He finished the season hitting .262. His Orioles won another pennant, but lost the World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games.\nDuring the 1971 World Series, Blair earned a place in baseball history in Game 4 by being the first man to bat in a World Series night game. Leading off the top of the first inning, Blair singled off Pittsburgh's Luke Walker.\nBlair's speed going back in the outfield enabled him to play shallow, and make catches à la Willie Mays. In each of the Orioles' three straight World Series seasons, Blair won a Gold Glove. He also won a Gold Glove over each of the next four seasons, his last Gold Glove in coinciding with teammate Brooks Robinson winning his 16th consecutive — and last — Gold Glove at third base.\nNew York Yankees.\nBlair was traded by the Orioles to the New York Yankees for Elliott Maddox and Rick Bladt on January 20, 1977. The transaction was driven by general manager Gabe Paul's desire to exile Maddox from the Yankees. Blair was primarily a defensive outfielder replacement in the late innings. On June 18 of that year in a nationally televised game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, he was tangentially involved in one of the most bizarre scenes in baseball history. Yankee manager Billy Martin took right fielder Reggie Jackson out of the game and replaced him with Blair after Jackson had misplayed Jim Rice's fly ball for a double. As the cameras watched, Jackson and Martin nearly came to blows. Blair's walk-off RBI single to left off Rick Rhoden won Game 1 of the 1977 World Series for the Yankees.\nActor Seth Gilliam played Blair in one episode of the ESPN mini-series \"The Bronx Is Burning\". The mini-series chronicled the 1977 Yankees season.\nCincinnati Reds and second Yankees stint.\nAfter winning World Series titles with the Yankees in 1977 and , Blair was released early in the season. The Cincinnati Reds signed him as a free agent less than a month later, and Blair returned to the Yankees in May of . He retired after the Yankees released him a second time, on July 1 of that year.\nCareer summary.\nIn his 17-year career, Blair, whose nickname, \"Motormouth\", came from his talkative nature, batted .250 with 134 home runs and 620 RBI, 1513 hits and 171 stolen bases in 1947 games played. He was also one of the top bunters in the game, recording at least 10 sacrifice hits four times in his career, including 17 during the 1975 season.\nPalmer loved having Blair in the outfield because of his fielding ability. In his 1996 book \"Palmer and Weaver: Together We Were Eleven Foot Nine\", he reminisced about the time Weaver gave him three batting lineups to choose from for a game. \"I'm looking basically for one thing,\" Palmer wrote. \"Center field. We've got Paul Blair, who I personally think can field anything.\" According to Palmer, Blair caught 12 fly balls that night. Palmer also thought Blair \"was worth two runs, defensively, every game.\"\nCoaching career.\nAt the end of his playing career, Blair was hired as an outfield instructor for the Yankees in 1981. In August 1982, he was named the head coach at Fordham University. Blair coached only one season at Fordham with the team finishing with a 14–19 record. He then went back to work as an outfield instructor with the Houston Astros and as a third base coach for the Orioles Triple A team in Rochester and worked in that capacity until 1985.\nIn 1989, he played for the Gold Coast Suns in the newly formed Senior Professional Baseball Association, though the league folded after the season. Blair got his next shot at coaching in 1995 when he was named the manager of the Yonkers Hoot Owls in the newly formed Northeast League, an independent league of professional baseball. The team lasted just one season and finished a dismal 12–52.\nBlair got his next, and last, shot at coaching in 1998 when he was named as the head coach for the Coppin State College baseball team. Blair coached the team from 1998–2002. Unfortunately, his overall record at Coppin State was a disappointing 30–185.\nIn the mid-1990s Blair was named the assistant general manager of the yet-to-be named New Orleans franchise in the United Baseball League (UBL) (which was a planned third major league).\nLater life and death.\nAfter his retirement from coaching, Blair lived in Woodstock, Maryland with his wife, Gloria. In his retirement, Blair often appeared in celebrity golf and bowling tournaments. At the time of his death, he was known for working out at Triangle Fitness in Eldersburg, Maryland and bowling at Kings Point Lanes in Reisterstown, Maryland. His son Paul Blair III played eight years in the minors for the San Francisco Giants and the Chicago Cubs.\nOn December 26, 2013, Blair suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness while playing in a celebrity bowling tournament in Pikesville, Maryland. He was taken by ambulance to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, where he was pronounced dead.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project"

His nickname is The Assassin.\nCareer.\nAtkins has been a Yorkshire county player since 1996 and has represented the England national side in many occasions including 3 times in the Six Nations, winning all three, and once in the World Cup in 2011, contributing to England's best performance since 1995. He reached the last 16 of the BDO World Professional Darts Championship in both 2006 and 2007. In 2006 he led Martin Adams 3–0 and had a match dart in the fifth leg of the fifth set, but ultimately lost 4–3. The following year, he was beaten by eventual finalist Phill Nixon.\nHe was seeded number 10 for the 2008 BDO World Darts Championship. However, he lost in the first round to Andy Boulton. The following year, unseeded, Atkins won his first round match 3–2 against Joey ten Berge before losing to Gary Robson 4–1.\nSeeded number 10 for the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship, Atkins suffered another first round exit after he was defeated by Lakeside debutant Paul Carter 3–1. In 2011, Atkins was drawn against third seed and eventual runner-up Dean Winstanley in the first round, and lost 3–2 having missed two match darts in the fourth set.\nAtkins finally progressed past the second-round stage of the World Championship when, in 2012, he defeated 7th seed John Walton and 10th seed Willy van de Wiel en route to a quarter-final match against Ted Hankey where he lost 5–1. In 2012, Atkins won the biggest title of his career so far by winning the BDO British Open, beating Robbie Green in the final. However, his season ended in disappointment when he lost in the first round of the World Championship to Jason Cullen.\nAtkins was unseeded for the 2014 World Championship and faced eighth seed Jeffrey de Graaf in the first round. Despite competing with an elbow injury sustained on New Year's Day, and despite de Graaf throwing for two of the sets, Atkins won the match 3–0, finishing with a 135 checkout on the bullseye. However, Atkins had to withdraw during his second round match against Rick Hofstra while trailing 2–0 in sets.\nPDC.\nAnnounced on 9 December 2017, he will be joining the rival organisation the Professional Darts Corporation for the first time in his career.

        "text": "Allan Jacobsen (born 22 September 1978 in Edinburgh) is a retired Scottish rugby union player. Nicknamed \"Chunk\", Jacobsen played with Edinburgh his entire professional career.\nHe started playing for Edinburgh aged 15 and made his debut in a friendly against the touring ACT Brumbies in November 1997.\nHe made his international debut against Canada on the 2002 summer tour to North America.\nHe was called up to the World Cup squad in Australia in 2003 as a replacement for the injured Gavin Kerr after returning to international duty against Ireland.\nHe tore a groin muscle because he haddocked his horse in the 2007 Rugby World Cup and required shoulder surgery having injured himself against Italy. He was scheduled to be out for four months.\nSince making his debut in 1997 he has gone on to make 228 appearances for Edinburgh in all competitions (). He signed a three-year contract extension to stay with the club until 2013. He currently has the most Edinburgh Magners League caps, with 108.\nAllan Frederick Jacobsen became the 29th Scot to reach the milestone of 50 caps when he played in Scotland's 19–16 triumph against Samoa at Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen in November 2010. It rounded off a year when Jacobsen was lauded by Scotland's scrummaging coach Massimo Cuttitta for the part he played in the 2010 summer tour victory in Argentina.\nJacobsen played in all 11 of Scotland's 2008 internationals, and the sequence continued when he played against Wales, France, and Italy in the 2009 RBS Six Nations Championship – 14 in a row. Playing in all of this season's Bank of Scotland Corporate Autumn Tests and RBS 6NC and the two tests on the tour to Argentina, he has now appeared in 25 of Scotland's past 27 internationals.\nOn the 2004 summer tour to Australia, injury curtailed him to only two outings (against Queensland Reds and New South Wales Country), but he regained his starting place for that year's Autumn Tests series. Allan made his first start in a Murrayfield international match when he played against Ireland in the RWC Countdown Test in September 2003. Though omitted for the World Cup in Australia, he was subsequently called up to the Scotland in Australia as a replacement for the injured Gavin Kerr.\nHis 2003 international against Ireland was 15 months on from his previous cap on Scotland's 2002 tour to North America. He was chosen at tight-head prop for that tour's warm-up match against the Barbarians but had reverted to his customary position on the left of the scrum when he won his first cap. Allan played as a replacement in all eight of Scotland's internationals in season 2006–07, but he was back in the starting XV in the World Cup warm-up contest in which Scotland beat Ireland 31–21 at Murrayfield. Misfortune struck when he damaged a leg on his World Cup debut during Scotland's opening match against Portugal in St Etienne, and because of the injury he had to drop out of the squad. But he was back as loose head for all of Scotland's matches in the 2008 RBS Six nations Championship, including the Calcutta Cup victory against England at Murrayfield, and later that year he continued in that role for the two Tests in Argentina. Two years before his first cap he was at loose-head prop in three of Scotland's matches on the 2000 tour of New Zealand.\nA mobile ball-player, Allan was selected for the tour after a fine debut for Scotland A against their English counterparts at Goldenacre in April 2000, and he also represented Scotland in the non-cap games against the Barbarians at Murrayfield in 2000 and 2001 and scored a try against that renowned invitation team in the 2005 match in Aberdeen. In season 2001–02 he played for Scotland Development XV against Tonga and Scotland A against Argentina, New Zealand, England, Italy and Ireland, scoring two tries against the Pumas in the 40–35 victory, but he broke a hand bone in the game at Ravenhill, Belfast. In June 2006 he played in all three Scotland A matches in the Barclays Churchill Cup in Canada, taking his tally at that level to 17 games, and five months later he returned to the national squad, making replacement appearances in the Bank of Scotland Corporate international wins against Romania and the Pacific Islanders at Murrayfield.\nAllan, a Preston Lodge High School former pupil and a product of the Preston Lodge club in Prestonpans, East Lothian, has played more than 250 games for Edinburgh, attaining the double-century in the Magners League game against Newport Gwent Dragons in September 2008. His Edinburgh debut was nearly 11 years earlier as a replacement against ACT Brumbies at Meggetland in November 1997. Previously he played age-group representative rugby for Edinburgh and was a graduate of the Scotland under-21 and under-18 teams.\nJacobsen retired from international rugby on 19 November 2012, and announced his retirement from all rugby, effective at the end of the 2012–13 season, on 23 April 2013. Shortly after he announced his retirement, Edinburgh Rugby announced it would create a new trophy, fashioned from a mould of Jacobsen's cauliflower right ear, for the club's \"most dedicated\" player. Jacobsen received the inaugural honour at the end of the 2012–13 season; in future seasons, the trophy will be awarded by a fan vote."

They were known as the Calgary Royals from 1990 until 2010. On May 4, 2019, it was announced that the Mustangs had elected to take a leave of absence for the 2019–20 season.\nHistory.\nThe franchise began play in the 1972–73 season as The Pass Red Devils based in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta. The Red Devils franchise lasted four years before relocating to the nearby community of Pincher Creek to become the Pincher Creek Panthers. The team lasted two seasons in Pincher Creek before relocating to Calgary to become the Calgary Chinooks. In 1979–80, under a new ownership group, the Chinooks became the Calgary Spurs.\nFollowing the 1989–90 season, the Spurs ceased operations, leaving the AJHL with just seven franchises. The league opted to keep a second Calgary-based franchise along with the Calgary Canucks, and sold a new franchise to four local businessmen who named it the Calgary Jr. \"A\" Royals with the mandate of providing Calgary and area kids with the opportunity to combine a high level of hockey with a quality education.\nThe Royals were immediately successful, finishing second in the regular season standings, behind the Fort Saskatchewan Traders and winning the league championship in their first season. The Royals were unable to duplicate that success, as the team failed to make it past the second round of the playoffs since winning the title.\nFaced with the challenges of sharing a market with the National Hockey League, Western Hockey League, and another AJHL team, the Royals were supported through corporate partnerships and volunteers. Seeking to distinguish itself from the city's minor hockey program of the same name, the franchise renamed itself the Mustangs prior to the 2010–11 season.\nAfter several seasons of struggling financially, the Mustangs were granted a leave of absence for the 2019–20 season.\nThe Mustangs are approved to move to Blackfalds, Alberta for the 2021–22 season, after being sold to Doug Quinn.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T/OTL = Ties/Overtime losses, SOL = Shootout losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\nNHL alumni.\nSome of the players that played on the Royals that went on to play in the NHL include:"

However, a number of students from the California Institute of Technology managed to alter the card stunt shown during the halftime break, by making the Washington fans inadvertently spell out \"CALTECH\".\nThe prank has been described as the \"greatest collegiate prank of all time\" and received national attention, as the game was broadcast to an estimated 30 million viewers across the United States by NBC. One author wrote, \"Few college pranks can be said to be more grandly conceived, carefully planned, flawlessly executed, and publicly dramatic\" than the Great Rose Bowl Hoax.\nPlanning.\nThe hoax was planned by a group of Caltech students in December 1960, subsequently known as the \"Fiendish Fourteen\". Their leader was 19-year-old engineering student Lyn Hardy. They felt that their college was ignored up to and during the Rose Bowl Game, though the school's teams often played in the Rose Bowl Stadium a few miles from campus. The students decided to use Washington's flip-card show to garner some attention.\nTo discover the details behind the Huskies' show, Hardy disguised himself as a reporter for a local Los Angeles high school (Dorsey High School), and interviewed Washington's head cheerleader. He learned that they would be able to trick unsuspecting Washington fans into holding up the incorrect signs by changing the 2,232 instruction sheets.\nThe students broke into the Cal State Long Beach dorm rooms where the Washington cheerleaders were staying and removed a single instruction sheet from a bedroom. They printed copies and altered each page by hand. On New Year's Eve, three of the \"Fiendish Fourteen\" reentered the cheerleaders' dorm building and replaced the stack of old sheets with the new.\nSome of the helpers were: Michael Lampton, later an astronaut; Reg Clemens, who became a consultant for research-and-development company Sandia Labs; Lon Bell, later chief executive of Amerigon Inc.; Harry Keller, later CEO of Smart Science Education Inc.; and Allen Berman, later a project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nExecution.\nAt halftime on January 2, 1961, the Washington card stunt was executed as the Caltech students had hoped. NBC cameras panned to the section raising the flip-cards as they uneventfully displayed the first eleven designs.\nThe twelfth design modified the design of a husky into that of a beaver (Caltech's mascot) but was subtle enough that the audience did not notice.\nThe thirteenth design called for the word \"Washington\" in script to gradually appear from left to right (starting with the capital \"W\"), but it ran backwards (with the small letter \"n\" appearing first). Other sources say that the routine intended to spell out \"HUSKIES\", but that it had been altered to spell out \"SEIKSUH\". Regardless, it was dismissed as a simple mistake.\nThe fourteenth design, however, was an unmistakable prank. \"CALTECH\" was displayed in big block letters on a white background.\nReaction and aftermath.\nMel Allen and Chick Hearn covered the game for an NBC national telecast. The announcers and the stadium fell silent for several moments before breaking into laughter. As the Washington band marched off the field, the cheerleaders did not give the signal for the fifteenth and final image. The Huskies were unaware that the Caltech students had not altered the last design, which was an American flag.\nThe game resulted in a 17–7 victory by the Washington Huskies, their second straight win at the Rose Bowl. The practical joke was detailed in the next morning's \"Seattle Times\" alongside coverage of the game.\nThe card stunt was photographed by Rose Bowl attendee Bruce Whitehead, who provided a black and white photograph to Caltech for publication. In 2014, Whitehead's original color Kodachrome slide was discovered and donated to the Caltech Archives.\nSimilar hoaxes.\nA similar hoax by Caltech at the 1984 Rose Bowl was inspired by this one. A group of students altered the scoreboard to show Caltech leading its rival MIT 38 to 9. It was the UCLA Bruins leading the Illinois Fighting Illini by that score in the third quarter. The students also altered the scoreboard to rename the game, \"The Beaver Bowl\" in reference to the Caltech and MIT mascots.\nAnother hoax reminiscent of the Great Rose Bowl Hoax is Yale University's November 2004 prank against Harvard.\nFor the 2014 Rose Bowl, Caltech students built a large white \"PASADENA\" sign overlooking the stadium. Just before halftime, they turned on lights on the sign which spelled out \"CALTECH\"."

        "title": "Venezuelan Professional Baseball League",
        "text": "The Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (, or LVBP) is the top-level professional baseball league in Venezuela. The league's champion takes part in the Caribbean Series each year.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nBaseball exploded in Venezuela in 1941, following the world championship in Havana. By then, the appearance of professional baseball in Venezuela attracted many ball players from the Caribbean and the United States to the country, showing a more integrated sport there than it was in the United States. This is evidenced in the hiring of stellar players like Ramón Bragaña, Martín Dihigo, Oscar Estrada, Cocaína García, Bertrum Hunter, Roy Campanella, Sam Jethroe, Satchel Paige, and Roy Welmaker.\nOn December 27, 1945, the owners of Cervecería Caracas (Caracas Brewery), Sabios de Vargas (Vargas Wisemen), Navegantes del Magallanes (Magellan Navigators), and Patriotas de Venezuela (Venezuelan Patriots) created the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. The league was formally registered as an institution during January 1946, and in the same month organized its first tournament, starting on January 3, 1946.\nSabios de Vargas, led by Daniel 'Chino' Canónico, became the first champion, with a record of 18 wins and 12 losses.\nDuring the first tournaments, games were played on Thursdays and Saturdays on the afternoons, and Sundays in the morning. This was the norm until Cervecería Caracas' park — located in the San Agustín del Norte zone of Caracas — was fitted with electric lights, enabling its use during night games. Thus, a game was added on Tuesday nights.\nEventually, the tournament was changed to accommodate two rounds, with the top team of each round having a best-of-5 play-off to determine the champion.\n1950s and '60s.\nOn August 8, 1952, Pablo Morales and Oscar Prieto Ortiz purchased the Cervecería Caracas team from Martín Tovar Lange, as the Caracas Brewery Co. was unable to continue sponsoring the team and it had the highest payroll of the league. The new owners renamed the team as Leones del Caracas (Caracas Lions), after the full name of the city, Santiago de Leon de Caracas. On October 17, 1952, the 1952-1953 season of the league started, with the first game of Leones del Caracas vs. Venezuela BBC. Leones del Caracas ended their season as champions for the first time.\nThe next season, alongside the start of limited television coverage of the league, would see the departure of the teams Sabios de Vargas and Venezuela BBC due to economic problems, being replaced by two teams (Gavilanes and Pastora) from the professional league of the Zulia State, from western Venezuela.\nIn 1954 Sabios de Vargas was replaced by Santa Marta and Patriotas de Venezuela came back both only for that year.\nIn 1955 a new team was added in the place of the departed Venezuela, named Pampero; while the Santa Marta BBC was moved out of Caracas, and renamed to Industriales de Valencia (Valencia Industrymen).\nThe 1956-1957 tournament would see further changes: the Navegantes del Magallanes team was purchased by advertisers Joe Novas and Joe Cruz and renamed as Oriente, leaving the league made of Leones del Caracas, Oriente, Pampero and Industriales de Valencia.\nIn 1962, Los Tiburones de La Guaira (La Guaira Sharks) were brought into the league to replace Pampero.\nIn 1965, the league expanded from 4 to 6 teams, with the addition of the teams Cardenales de Lara (Lara Cardinals) and Tigres de Aragua (Aragua Tigers).\nFor the 1968-1969 tournament, the Industrymen left the city of Valencia and relocated to Acarigua with a new name: Los Llaneros. This left Valencia without a team, prompting the move of Navegantes del Magallanes from Caracas to Valencia, and their return to their original name for the 1969-1970 tournament.\nIn 1969, Las Águilas del Zulia (Zulia Eagles) joined the VPBL to replace Industriales de Valencia.\n1970s and '80s.\nThe 1970s saw the first successes for Venezuelan teams outside of Venezuela since the amateur championships of the 1940s, with the Navegantes del Magallanes winning two Caribbean Series. It also saw problems for the league, in the form of the strike that prevented the 1973-1974 tournament, and the problems the Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira had in 1975–1976 to secure a baseball park to play their home games. This resulted in both teams merged into one, and forced to move to the city of Acarigua.\nAlso in the 1970s, Tigres de Aragua won the first championships for the 1960s expansion teams.\nThe 1980s saw the Leones del Caracas winning five tournaments, consolidating their lead as the most successful team in the league. Leones del Caracas also went on to win three championships in a row starting in the 1979–80 season, and their first Caribbean Series in 1982. The decade also saw success for the Tiburones de La Guaira, with the team winning 3 championships.\nAlso in the 1980s, the Águilas del Zulia won their first two championships, all the way to also winning their first two Caribbean Series in 1984 and 1989.\n1990s and 2000s.\nIn 1991, the league expanded from six to eight teams, with the addition of the Caribes de Oriente (Eastern Caribbeans), who are now the Caribes de Anzoátegui (Anzoátegui Caribbeans); and the Petroleros de Cabimas (Cabimas Oilers), who became Pastora de los Llanos (Llanos Shepherds), and from the 2007–08 season on, Bravos de Margarita (Margarita Braves). This led to a change in format, with the eight teams being organized in two divisions: the Eastern Division (División Oriental) with the teams Caracas, Magallanes, La Guaira and Oriente; and the Western Division (División Occidental) with the teams Zulia, Lara, Aragua and Cabimas. The first two teams from each division by the end of the regular season of the tournament would qualify to the round-robin semifinals.\nThe format would change again some years later, with the addition of a wildcard team in the semifinals: the best placed third-place from the two divisions would accompany the other four teams in a round-robin semifinal.\nFor the 2007–08 season, with the move of the Pastora team from the western city of Acarigua to the eastern city of Porlamar, the Western Division and the Eastern Division were merged into a single division of eight teams, with the top five teams advancing to the semifinals.\nThe 2015–2016 season saw a new change in format, with a regular season divided in two rounds, which ranked the teams by their record and assigned points depending on their position in the table at the end of each round. The total points from both rounds are added at the end of the regular season, and the teams are then ranked by points. Also part of the format change was the introduction of a sixth team qualified for the semifinals, and the change of the semifinal from a round robin format to two phases of play-offs to the best of 7 games.\nIn recent years, Tigres de Aragua has become the most dominant team of the league, winning the crown seven times in the last fifteen years, including three times in a row from the 2006-07 season to the 2008-09 season and also winning the Caribbean Series in 2009.\nOn August 22, 2019, Major League Baseball banned its affiliated players from playing in the Venezuelan League to comply with President Donald Trump's embargo on Venezuela. This ban was later limited to only Navegantes del Magallanes and Tigres de Aragua, and has since been lifted for all clubs.\nAll Star Game.\nThe league has scheduled All Star Games most years, sometime featuring Criollos (Venezuelan) vs Importados (foreigners), Western Division vs Eastern Division or Stars vs \"Stars of the Future\", and even a Venezuela's League Stars vs. Dominican Republic's League Stars inter-league all star game during the 2007-2008 and 2011-2012 tournaments.\nFormat.\nThe league houses eight teams in two divisions, the Occidental (Western) and the Central divisions. The tournament is divided into a regular season and a postseason consisting of a semi-final and final round.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season follows a round robin format where a total of 63 games are disputed by each of the eight teams that made up the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, meaning that each team faces every other team a total of 9 times, 5 times as home club and 4 times as away team; the number of games as home club between any 2 clubs alternates year by year.\nAt the end of the regular season, the teams are ranked from first place to last in their division depending on their win–loss record, and the first 2 teams in each division qualify.\nIn the case of a tie between qualified teams, their position on the table is determined by the following criteria:\nIn the case of a tie between teams where a position in the postseason needs to be determined, the tie will be solved with extra games.\nPostseason.\nThe postseason consists of a semi-final and final round. All the series are playoff series to the best of 7 games. In all of these single elimination series, the team with better standing during the regular season has home advantage, playing the first two games as home club, then two games away, and if necessary, the fifth game is away and the last two games as home club.\nSemifinal Round.\nThe semifinal round consists of two series in a best-of-seven format. The first team in one division faces the second team in the other division.\nThere are rest days in both series after the second and fifth games.\nFinal.\nThe play-off final is a series in a best-of-seven-format between the winners of the semifinal-series. The winner of this series goes on to play is the Caribbean Series.\nVenezuelan Caribbean Series Champions.\nThe Venezuelan champion moves on to the Caribbean Series to face the champions of the baseball leagues of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Panama and Colombia. Venezuelan teams have won the Caribbean Series eight times, most recently in 2024 by the Tiburones de La Guaira, after having won the LVBP title during the 2023–24 season."

A total of 13 players from three nations competed, with two additional players withdrawing. This was the first time in Olympic history that Great Britain had a medal sweep in an event. Laurence Doherty took top honors, beating Harold Mahony in the final. Laurence's brother Reginald refused to play Laurence in the semifinals and forfeited; he and Arthur Norris are considered bronze medalists.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the men's singles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe Doherty brothers of Great Britain were heavily favored. Reginald Doherty had just won his fourth straight The Championships, Wimbledon singles title. Laurence Doherty would later win five (1902–1906). Their strongest competition was likely Harold Mahony, who had won Wimbledon in 1896 and the European championship in 1899. Max Decugis was the strongest non-British player (and would win 8 French championships after the Games), but he withdrew; André Prévost was the 1900 French runner-up.\nThe United States made its debut in the event. France and Great Britain both made their second appearance.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with no bronze-medal match (both semifinal losers tied for third).

He is also a former player with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League and currently serves as the team's manager.\nMajor League career.\nButler first signed with the Blue Jays as an amateur free agent on September 24, 1990, and made his major league debut with them on June 12, 1993. He played in 17 regular season games and was sidelined by a hand injury he suffered when attempting to steal a base. In his 17-game stint in 1993, he had a .271 batting average with four doubles, two RBIs and 12 strikeouts. He also drew seven walks and went 2-for-4 stealing bases. In the 1993 World Series, won by Toronto, Butler went 1-for-2 with a pinch hit single off Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies, and became the only Canadian player to have won a World Series with the Blue Jays.\nIn 1994, Butler played in 41 games for the Blue Jays, batting .176 with one triple and five RBIs. Much of this season was split between the Blue Jays and their Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs. On December 5, 1994 he was traded to the Phillies.\nWith the Phillies organization, Butler spent much of it in their minor league system, but was called up in 1997, and he played in 43 games, batting .292 with nine doubles, one triple, and 13 RBIs.\nOn December 22, 1997, Butler signed with the Houston Astros and spent 1998 in their minor league system.\nOn December 23, 1998, he returned to the Blue Jays as a free agent and appeared in eight games with the Jays during the 1999 season, playing his last Major League Baseball game on July 10, 1999.\nSemi-pro baseball.\nIn 2001, Butler joined the semi-pro Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League as an outfielder. He was also joined by his brother Rich Butler, and later by former Blue Jays pitcher Paul Spoljaric. For much of those years, Rob finished the season as the team's batting leader, and in 2002, he won the league championship with them. In 2005, Butler played his last game with the Leafs, announcing his retirement from the game.\nAs of April 2009, Butler is a coach with the Canadian National Junior Team.\nIn 2023, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Butler as team manager."

        "text": "Gordon William Hunter (born June 4, 1928) is an American former shortstop, coach and manager in Major League Baseball.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Hunter was listed as tall and . He threw and batted right-handed. After attending Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Penn State, Hunter was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948. He was sold to the St. Louis Browns of the American League (AL) on October 14, 1952, for $150,000 after leading the Texas League in fielding and stolen bases. \nHunter was the starting shortstop for the last Browns club in 1953 and the first modern Baltimore Orioles team when the Brownies moved to Maryland in 1954. For the remainder of his career, however, he was a second-string infielder for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics and Cleveland Indians. Hunter batted .219 with 16 home runs and 144 RBI in 630 games over his six-year (1953–58) AL career.\nScout and coach.\nWhen Hunter finished his playing career, he scouted for the Indians and Orioles. He managed the Bluefield Orioles to Appalachian League championships in 1962 and 1963. Hunter was promoted to Baltimore on November 20, 1963, as third-base coach by former Yankees teammate Hank Bauer, who had become the team's manager one day earlier. He performed that role for almost 14 seasons for four AL champions and two World Series winners. Hunter declined an offer from former Orioles general manager Harry Dalton to manage the California Angels on November 23, 1971.\nMLB manager and college head coach.\nHunter departed from the Orioles on June 27, 1977, to become the Texas Rangers' fourth manager that season, succeeding Connie Ryan, who had served in the interim for six games. His appointment ended the Rangers' bizarre search for a new manager, which had begun five day prior with Frank Lucchesi's dismissal, followed by Eddie Stanky's one-game stint. Despite the team trailing by games in fifth place in the AL West, he stated upon his arrival, \"I am accepting this job because I think the Texas Rangers have a contending team.\" Under Hunter, the Rangers won 60 of their final 93 games and climbed from fifth to second place. In 1978 the Rangers finished tied for second, five games behind the division-leading Kansas City Royals. During the season, Hunter had a confrontation with pitcher Dock Ellis on a team bus. Ellis was later quoted saying Hunter \"may be Hitler, but he ain't making no lampshade out of me.\" After turning down a five-year contract extension in midseason, offered by Rangers' young owner, Brad Corbett, Hunter was fired with one day left in the campaign due to his poor relationship with his team. When asked if he was sorry he took the manager's job, Hunter replied \"yes.\"\nHunter's record over his one-and-a-half seasons was 146–108 (.575), but he never returned to the Major Leagues as a coach or manager, though he claimed to have received a half dozen job offers in the winter of 1978. He became head baseball coach and athletic director at Maryland's Towson State University, retiring in 1995. He was a 1996 honoree into the Orioles Hall of Fame, inducted with Jerry Hoffberger and Cal Ripken, Sr. These three men were so well thought of in Baltimore that a crowd of 400 showed up at the luncheon at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel."

        "title": "Pick 6 (horse racing)",
        "text": "A pick 6 is a type of wager offered by horse racing tracks. It requires bettors to select the winners of six consecutive races. Because of the great difficulty in picking six straight winners, plus the number of betting interests involved, payoffs for successful wagers are quite high, sometimes in the millions of dollars.\nBackground.\nThe pick 6 has its roots in the daily double, the first so-called \"exotic\" wager offered by horse tracks. To win the daily double, a bettor must pick the winner of two consecutive races, traditionally the first two races or the last two races (a \"late double\") of the program. The pick 6 merely extends this principle. The wager is offered once per program, and is usually offered on six races which conclude with the featured race of the day.\nWagering.\nThe wager is conducted in parimutuel fashion, with all pick 6 bets going into a separate pool from other kinds of betting. There is one \"betting interest\" for each available combination, and the number of combinations is equal to the product of the number of runners in all six races. A simplified example: If there are ten horses in each of the six races, then the number of combinations is 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10, or 1,000,000.\nThe pick 6 wager actually has two payoffs, one for bettors who pick all six winners, and a smaller payoff for those who pick five out of six. The total pick 6 betting pool is divided by percentage between the two payouts, along the lines of 75% for the six-winner pool and 25% for the five-winner pool.\nBecause of the sheer difficulty of successfully choosing six straight winners, plus the large number of betting interests, it is common for there to be no winning wager on all six races. When that happens, the six-winner portion of the pool carries over to the following program, and continues to carry over until it is won. This allows the \"carryover pool\" to grow to large sums, and tracks usually publicize the fact that their carryover pool has grown to six or seven figures. The five-winner pool is paid out each day, however; if no bettors have chosen five out of six winners, then those who have chosen four winners are paid, or even just three winners (which has happened when a series of longshots have won races). The pick 6 pool is also paid out in its entirety on a designated date, such as the last day of a race meet or a day with a guaranteed minimum pool; if there are no six-winner tickets, then the pool is split among five-winner tickets.\nBetting strategy.\nBecause of the huge number of betting interests involved, bettors will often try to increase their chances of winning by selecting multiple combinations. This can be costly — a bettor who wants to cover two horses in each race must bet on 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 combinations, or 64 combinations, times $2 for each for a total of $128. This method is called \"boxing horses,\" and is also used with other wagers such as a trifecta or superfecta.\nThe most successful punters invariably use a multiple ticket strategy combined with one or more singles (legs in which they have only selected a single runner). They have in effect constructed multiple scenarios many of which they know in advance will lose. The point being that with each successive leg, as the exotic pick 6 pool sheds tickets, they have several tickets that are still \"live\" and have a chance of winning the bet or percentage thereof Several punters construct these multiple combinations manually and others use pick six software to assist in the process of construction. The critical components of any strategy invariably revolve around handicapping correctly (picking the contenders) and correctly constructing multiple ticket combinations.\nIn some countries, such as South Africa, punters are allowed to play a percentage of the bet making it cheaper than in the U.S. where a single line is a minimum of $2. In South Africa, punters can take as little as 1% of a pick 6 ticket and the single line is a minimum of only R1, so that 1,000 combinations can be bet for as little as R10.\nExceptions.\nLate scratches.\nBecause all pick 6 wagers must be made before the first of the six races, there are many times when a horse is scratched from a race well after the wager is placed. How this is handled varies according to the rules of the racing jurisdiction. In most cases, the track substitutes the horse that is the post time betting favorite (in the \"win\" betting pools); if the bettor's original horse is a late scratch and the post time favorite wins, then the bettor is considered to have picked the winner for that race. In other cases, the track may declare combinations involving the scratched horse to have \"no action,\" and the wager is refunded.\nRaces moved from turf to dirt.\nAt North American tracks, races which are run on a turf (grass) course must sometimes be moved to the main dirt course, usually due to heavy rain or other adverse weather conditions; sometimes this switch is made after pick 6 wagering is closed. Moving from turf to dirt greatly affects the wagering decisions of astute handicappers, as many horses perform differently according to the racing surface. For pick 6 wagering, different tracks handle this situation in different ways. In New York, a race moved from turf to dirt after pick 6 wagering closes is declared an \"all win\" race, where picks on any horse in that race are declared successful. If only one race is moved, bettors who successfully pick the other five race winners will win or share the full six-winner pool, including carryovers. If two races are moved, bettors who pick the other four winners will win or share in that day's six-winner pool, but \"no\" carryover, and the previous carryover pool only goes to the next program. (Few North American tracks schedule more than two turf races in a program.)"

        "text": "The ISU Speed Skating World Cup is a series of international speed skating competitions, organised annually by the International Skating Union since the winter of 1985–86. Every year during the winter season, a number of competitions on different distances and on different locations are held. Skaters can earn points at each competition, and the skater who has the most points on a given distance at the end of the series is the winner. Initially not very popular with skaters nor spectators, the World Cup has gradually become more and more popular, and this was due to the creation of the World Single Distance Championships. The results of the separate distances in the World Cup ranking are the main qualifying method for the World Single Distance Championships.\nThe number of races per season per distance varies, but it is usually between five and ten. Ten World Cup titles are awarded every season, five for men (the 500 m, the 1000 m, the 1500 m, the combined 5000 m / 10000 m, and the team pursuit), and five for women (the 500 m, the 1000 m, the 1500 m, the combined 3000 m / 5000 m, and the team pursuit).\nThe team pursuit was added to the World Cup in the 2005–06 season. Between the seasons 2003–04 and 2008–09, the 100 m was also contested for men and women, but this category is now defunct.\nThe mass start was re-introduced for both women and men in the World Cup in Astana in 2011.\nMost World Cup victories.\nThe skaters with the highest number of individual World Cup victories as of 19 February 2023.

        "title": "2009 World Baseball Classic",
        "text": "The 2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was an international baseball competition. It began on March 5 and finished March 23.\nUnlike in 2006, when the round-robin format of the first two rounds led to some eliminations being decided by run-difference tiebreakers, the first two rounds of the 2009 edition were modified double-elimination format. The modification was that the final game of each bracket was winner-take-all, even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket, although that game only affected seeding, as two teams always advanced from each bracket.\nThe biggest surprise in the first round was the Netherlands, which twice defeated the Dominican Republic in Pool D to advance. The second round saw the two Pool A teams (South Korea and Japan) defeat the two Pool B teams (Cuba and Mexico) while the two Pool C teams (Venezuela and the United States) defeated the two Pool D teams (Puerto Rico and the Netherlands). South Korea and Japan then advanced to the final game, playing each other for the fifth time in the tournament (split 2–2 up to that time), and Japan emerged victorious for the second straight Classic, winning the final game 5–3 in 10 innings.\nFor the second straight Classic, Daisuke Matsuzaka was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.\nFormat.\nAs was the case for the 2006 tournament, the sixteen teams were split into four pools of four teams each. Whereas previously the teams played in round-robin competition in the first two rounds, this time they took part in a double-elimination format, similar to the U.S. College World Series sponsored by the NCAA. Under the new format, teams were only guaranteed to play two games. This change was made to eliminate the complicated tiebreaking procedures, which were required for one of the pools in each of the first two rounds in 2006.\nAfter the first round, the tournament was held in the U.S. The top two teams from each of the four pools—seeded from the final game in their respective pools—went to the second round, with the teams from Pools A and B meeting at Petco Park in San Diego for Pool 1, and the teams in Pools C and D playing at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens for Pool 2. Again, both pools made use of double-elimination to determine the teams qualifying for the semifinals. In another change from 2006, the four qualifying teams crossed over for the semifinals, with the winner of each pool playing against the runner-up from the other pool. The championship round process was otherwise unchanged, with each semifinal being a single elimination match, the victors meeting in the final to determine the tournament champion. All three championship round games were held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\nIn the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the home team.\nRosters.\nEach participating national federation had a deadline of January 19, 2009, to submit a 45-man provisional roster. Final rosters of 28 players, which was required to include a minimum of 13 pitchers and two catchers, were submitted on February 24. If a player on the submitted roster was unable to play, usually due to injury, he could be substituted at any time before the start of the tournament. While rosters could not be changed during a round of competition, a team that advanced to a later round could change its roster for the later round.\nVenues.\nSeven stadiums were used during the tournament:\nPools composition.\nThe 16 teams that participated in the 2006 World Baseball Classic were all invited back for the 2009 tournament. The World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) changed the members of each pool as compared with the 2006 Classic, however, except for Pool A. There was no official qualifying competition.\nFinal standings.\nOrganizer WBCI has no interest in the final standings and did not compute. So, it was calculated by IBAF for the IBAF Men's Baseball World Rankings.\nIn the final standings, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nAttendance.\n801,408 (avg. 20,549; pct. 54.5%)\nFirst round.\n453,374 (avg. 18,891; pct. 55.6%)\nSecond round.\n206,180 (avg. 17,182; pct. 42.3%)\nChampionship round.\n141,854 (avg. 47,285; pct. 84.4%)\nAdditional rules.\nAs was the case for the 2006 Classic, several rules were announced for the 2009 tournament that modified the existing rules for international baseball set out by the IBAF.\nOnce again there were limits on the number of pitches thrown in a game, though the limits themselves were changed from the previous tournament:\nIf a pitcher reached his limit during an at bat, he was allowed to finish pitching to the batter, but was removed from the game at the end of the at bat.\nA 30–pitch outing needed to be followed by one day off, and a 50–pitch outing by four days off. No one would be allowed to pitch on three consecutive days. As the championship round was played over three consecutive days, a so-called \"pitcher rest equalization\" rule was added: a pitcher making 30 or more pitches in a semifinal was ineligible to pitch in the final. This negated an advantage the winners of the first semifinal would have had in the final.\nA mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings in the first two rounds.\nInstant replay was also available to umpires during the tournament. As was introduced in Major League Baseball during the 2008 season, replays were only used to adjudicate on home run decisions, to determine whether the ball was fair or foul, over the fence or not, and the impact of fan interference.\nAn alternative version of the IBAF's extra inning rule was also introduced. If after 12 innings the score was still tied, each half inning thereafter would have started with runners on second and first base. The runners would have been the eighth and ninth hitters due in that inning respectively. For example, if the number five hitter was due to lead off the inning, the number three hitter would have been on second base, and the number four hitter on first base. However, this rule was never actually employed in this year's Classic, as the two extra-inning games in the tournament ended prior to a 13th inning.\nAll base coaches were required to wear protective helmets, in the aftermath of the death of Mike Coolbaugh and participating teams were required to announce the next day's starting pitcher. Additionally, a modified early termination rule was in effect for the first two rounds; had a team been ahead by 15 or more runs after five innings or ten or more runs after seven or eight innings, the game ended at that point.\nPrize money.\nUSD 14,000,000\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, ESPN and the MLB Network shared the rights, with ESPN broadcasting 23 of the games, including the Finals, while MLB Network showed the remaining 16. Spanish language telecasts in the U.S. were handled by ESPN Deportes telecasting all games. Internationally, it was broadcast to 167 countries by ESPN International.\nIn Canada, Rogers Sportsnet aired all 39 games.\nIn the Dominican Republic, CDN (Cadena de Noticias) and CDN2 broadcast all games live (except for games played in Tokyo, shown on tape delay)\nIn Japan, J Sports broadcast all 39 games. TV Asahi (Round 1) and TBS (Round 2 and Finals) broadcast all games featuring Japan. For all games featuring Japan, they gained viewing ratings of at least 20%. The final game gained ratings in the range 30-45%.\nVideo games.\nWorld Baseball Classic 2009 has licensed three video games, all only released in Japan: Pro Yakyuu Spirits 6, Baseball Heroes 2009\nand Jikkyou Pawafuru Major League 2009"

        "text": "John McCallister (January 19, 1879 – October 18, 1946) was manager of the Cleveland Indians during the 1927 season after Tris Speaker abruptly resigned. He would lead the Indians to a sixth-place finish and a 66-87 record.\nHe began his professional career in his native Marietta, Ohio. In 1902, he was playing for the Hartford Senators in the Connecticut League, and was expected to play for the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League the following year. However, in the fall of 1902 his knee was severely injured during a benefit game in Marietta, and he was unable to play for two years. After working as an umpire in 1905, he became a manager of the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Ohio State League in 1909; he later managed the Akron team in the Ohio–Pennsylvania and Central leagues. In 1913, the Indians hired him as a coach and scout. McCallister was Tris Speaker's primary assistant during his years as player-manager (1919–1926). McCallister became manager after Speaker's sudden resignation in late 1926. A second-place team in 1926, the Indians entered the 1927 season with a largely unchanged roster, except that Hall of Fame center fielder Speaker now played in Washington; the team won twenty-two fewer games in 1927. When asked about the reasons for the Indians' disappointing performance, McCallister replied, \"I guess it is that I just can't play centerfield.\" Following a change of ownership at the end of the season, McCallister's contract was not renewed. After spending the 1928 season as a coach and scout for the Detroit Tigers, he worked as a scout for the Boston Red Sox (1929–33), the Cincinnati Reds (1934), and the Boston Braves (1936–46). He died in Columbus, Ohio."

It has two eighteen-hole golf courses, the High Course and the West Course, of which the High Course has hosted many professional and elite amateur tournaments, including the Women's British Open in 1985.\nHistory.\nMoor Park Country Club was founded in 1923, with three golf courses set within the Moor Park estate, and Moor Park Mansion as its clubhouse. Sandy Herd was the club's first professional.\nThe club was reformed as Moor Park Golf Club after the courses were acquired by the local authority in 1937 for use as a public open space, intended to be part of London's green belt. The club retained the use of two courses, with the third becoming a municipal facility.\nThe club currently has approximately 1500 members, of whom 1000 are golfers, the remainder being composed of tennis members and social members. The club is run by a board of directors, all of whom are unpaid club members.\nGolf courses.\nThe golf courses at Moor Park are wooded parkland in nature and were designed by Harry Colt. The High Course is the longer of the two, and is considered \"championship standard\". The West Course was created from the first nine holes of the original No. 2 (West) Course, a few holes from the old No. 3 (East) Course, and several new holes.\nMajor tournaments hosted.\nMoor Park was a regular venue on the British PGA tournament circuit, which later became the European Tour, through to the end of the 1980s, hosting the British PGA Matchplay Championship (1925, 1932, 1970, 1972), Evening Standard Tournament (1925–1926), Silver King Tournament (1936–1953), Lotus Tournament (1952), Spalding Tournament (1954–1960), Esso Golden Tournament (1961–1967), Wills Tournament (1969), Uniroyal International (1976–1977), SOS Talisman TPC (1979) and Bob Hope British Classic (1981–1990).

        "text": "George Bevan \"Bo\" Strickland (January 10, 1926 – February 21, 2010) was an American professional baseball player and manager who spent ten seasons from 1950 to 1960 as am infielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians. He served as the Indians' interim manager twice in the 1960s. He was also a cousin of Hal Bevan.\nPlaying career.\nPrior to the majors.\nStrickland was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 10, 1926. He was a star shortstop at the city's S.J. Peters High School, where one of his teammates was Mel Parnell. Strickland also played for the Southwest Sectional champions representing his hometown at the American Legion Baseball World Series in Miles City, Montana in 1943. Immediately after the tournament, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team at the time, and made his professional debut on September 5, 1943. He appeared in only three games that season, all as a third baseman, and collected two singles in eight at bats.\nStrickland's baseball career was interrupted when he was drafted into the United States Navy in March 1944. He was stationed as a Specialist Mailman for 16 months in Saipan after American forces had captured the island from the Imperial Japanese Army in July of the same year. He was given his honorable discharge in May 1946.\nHe returned to the Pelicans, which had become a Boston Red Sox affiliate prior to the 1946 campaign, and played the latter half of the schedule at third base. After spending a little more than a season with the Scranton Red Sox, he was assigned to the Louisville Colonels in 1948, becoming a full-time shortstop. His best year in the minors was in 1949 when he batted .261 in 128 games with the Birmingham Barons.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nStrickland was selected by Pittsburgh in the Rule 5 draft on November 17, 1949. He made his Major League debut on May 7, 1950, in a 3–2 loss to the Dodgers at Forbes Field. During his three years with the team, the Pirates were relegated to the bottom two positions in the National League standings. His only season as its starting shortstop was when he batted .216 in 138 contests and committed a major-league-high 37 errors. He was traded with Ted Wilks to the Indians for John Beradino, Charlie Ripple and $50,000 on August 18, 1952.\nCleveland Indians.\nUpon his arrival in Cleveland, Strickland supplanted Ray Boone to become the starting shortstop through . Strickland's first full season with the team in was also his best at the plate as he hit .284 in 123 matches. His .976 fielding percentage in led all regular shortstops in the majors during that campaign. In his eight years with the ballclub, the Indians finished no lower than second place in the American League (AL) five times.\nHe was a key member of the 1954 AL Champions who ended the New York Yankees' run of five straight pennants and whose 111 regular-season victories established a junior circuit record that lasted until the Yankees won 114 games in , a mark surpassed when the Seattle Mariners won 116 in . The World Series that year, in which the Indians were swept in four games by the New York Giants, was Strickland's only postseason experience. He went hitless in nine at-bats in the first three contests. In the top half of the opening inning of the 6–2 defeat in Game 3 at Cleveland Stadium, he committed a throwing error attempting to complete a double play, leading to the Giants' first run of the match. He was replaced by Sam Dente in the series-ending 7–4 loss in Game 4.\nCleveland's acquisition of Chico Carrasquel after the 1955 season reduced Strickland's role to utility infielder. After stepping away from the sport for a year, he returned to the Indians in and made 122 starts, 72 at third base. His final game as a player was the Indians' 4–2 triumph over the Red Sox at Fenway Park on July 23, 1960. He entered the contest with one out in the Boston eighth as a substitute at third base for Bubba Phillips, who was sent to left field to replace Jimmy Piersall, who had been ejected for arguing with home plate umpire Ed Hurley over his distraction of batter Ted Williams. Strickland's playing career ended when he was released on August 3.\nManagerial/coaching career.\nStrickland worked as a scout for the Indians in . He spent the following year on Sam Mele's coaching staff with a Minnesota Twins team that finished in second place, five games behind the eventual World Series Champion Yankees. He returned to Cleveland to serve as third-base coach under three managers (Birdie Tebbetts, Joe Adcock and Alvin Dark) from to .\nHe became the Indians' interim manager at the beginning of the campaign when Tebbetts suffered a heart attack near the end of spring training on April 1. Strickland's managerial debut was a 7–6 loss at home to the Twins in the season opener on April 14. The ballclub made it to the top of the AL standings by the end of the month and would spend thirteen days in that position, the latest being on May 16. His stint ended with the team on a six-game losing streak, culminating in a 9–1 defeat on the road to the Detroit Tigers on July 2. The Indians were in eighth place with a 33–39 record and thirteen games behind the league-leading Baltimore Orioles by the time Tebbetts returned to the club the next day.\nStrickland was called upon to lead the ballclub on an interim basis again after Tebbetts was dismissed on August 19, 1966, with the 66–57 team in third place and trailing the eventual World Series Champion Orioles by fourteen games. Going 15–24 under Strickland, the Indians ended the campaign in fifth place at 81–81, seventeen games off the pace. The final contest he managed was a 2–0 loss to the California Angels in the season finale at Anaheim Stadium on October 2. His career record as a Major League manager was 48–63 (.432). Tommy John recalled that people thought Strickland would make a good manager. \"But the thing was, when he talked, you couldn't understand what he was saying. He'd get very deep, and you'd lose his point.\"\nWhen Strickland joined the Kansas City Royals coaching staff in , he was reunited with former Indians teammate Bob Lemon, who would be promoted to manager in early June. The most successful of the three years he spent in Kansas City was when the Royals vaulted into second place in the AL Western Division with an 85–76 record in only the franchise's third season of existence. Strickland retired from baseball in after a fourth-place finish with a 76–78 mark cost Lemon his job.\nLife after baseball.\nStrickland was once the parimutuels manager at Fair Grounds Race Course. He was interested in psychology and philosophy; John recalled him reading books by Thomas Aquinas, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jean-Paul Sartre. He was inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. He died at age 84 in New Orleans on February 21, 2010."

        "title": "John Jenkins (American football coach)",
        "text": "John Jenkins (born June 20, 1952) is an American football coach and former player. He served as the head football coach the University of Houston from 1990 to 1992, compiling a record of 18–15. A proponent of the run and shoot offense, Jenkins also coached professional football in the United States Football League (USFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). He served as the head coach of the CFL's Ottawa Renegades in 2006, the FXFL's Blacktips in 2014 and the Hudson Valley Fort for part of 2015. During his career as a coach, Jenkins has mentored a number of notable quarterbacks such as Andre Ware, David Klingler, Jim Kelly, Eric Crouch, Kliff Kingsbury, Anthony Calvillo and Doug Flutie.\nEarly life and playing career.\nJenkins was raised in Pampa, Texas. He played college football at the University of Arkansas.\nCoaching career.\nHouston Gamblers.\nAfter serving as the special teams coach for the Houston Gamblers of the USFL in 1984, Jenkins was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1985 with the departure of Mouse Davis, who moved to the Denver Gold as head coach. Jenkins kept the run and shoot offense that Davis had installed, but modified the offense into his own version. In Jenkins' debut as offensive coordinator against Steve Young and the Los Angeles Express, the Gamblers trailed 33–13 with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. Employing a hurry-up offense, the Gamblers came back to win the game 34–33. Since the game was not televised, \"Sports Illustrated\" dubbed it \"The Greatest Game Never Seen\".\nIn the fourth week of the 1985 season, the Gamblers met Davis' Denver Gold in the first game ever to pit two run and shoot offenses. The two offenses showed only small similarities as Jenkins employed various new tactics such as motioning receivers out of the backfield and going into empty sets. The Gamblers won 36–17.\nAfter the game, quarterback Jim Kelly was on pace to finish the season with 7,434 yards and 78 touchdowns. But due to a leg injury, he missed six games of the regular season and he fell well short of those marks. However, Kelly and his backup, Todd Dillon, combined 6,118 yards passing on the season, a record for professional American football. The Gamblers offense also featured three receivers—Clarence Verdin, Gerald McNeil, and Richard Johnson—that each totaled over 1,000 yards, a rarity that only Don Coryell's San Diego Chargers accomplished in the early 1980s. The Gamblers made the playoffs with a 10–8 record, and lost to the Birmingham Stallions, 22–20.\nDream Team.\nIn 1986, Donald Trump, owner of the New Jersey Generals, bought the Houston Gamblers. The Gamblers and the Generals were merged, matching the USFL's leading rusher, Herschel Walker, with its leading passer, Kelly, and creating what ESPN called the \"Dream Team\". There were also rumors of Jenkins installing a two-quarterback system with Doug Flutie in the slot. However, after a failed attempt to launch the season in the fall, the USFL folded, and the \"Dream Team\" never took the field.\nHouston Cougars.\nOffensive coordinator.\nJenkins moved to the University of Houston and joined the Houston Cougars football staff as the offensive coordinator in 1987. There he inherited a veer option offense featuring Andre Ware, who only threw one touchdown pass his entire high school career, and converted it into one of the most prolific passing attacks in college football history.\nWhen Jenkins joined the Cougars, he had further developed his offense from a pure run and shoot attack into what he referred to as the \"Multiple Adjusting Passing Offense\" or \"MAPO\". Jenkins' new offense made an immediate impact in the Southwest Conference as Houston beat the Texas Longhorns handily in each of his first three seasons: 60–40 in 1987, 66–15 in 1988, and 47–9 in 1989. In 1988, Jason Phillips and James Dixon became the first two college football receivers to finish a season with over 100 catches. In 1989, Houston scored over 40 points in nine of their 11 games, including a 95–21 rout of SMU in which they racked up 1,021 yards of offense. Ware finished the season with 4,699 yards and 44 touchdowns, set 26 NCAA records, and won the Heisman Trophy. The 1989 Houston offense averaged 624.9 total yards per game and 10.1 yards rushing per carry, both national records.\nHead coach.\nIn 1990, Cougars head coach Jack Pardee left the team to take the head coaching position with the National Football League's Houston Oilers. Jenkins was promoted to head coach of the Cougars. With Ware gone, David Klingler took over at quarterback and continued the success of Jenkins' passing attack. Klingler threw for over 400 yards in nine of 11 games in 1990, including a 716-yard performance against Arizona State in the Coca-Cola Classic. He averaged 474.6 yards a game, a national record. Klingler also broke the national record for most touchdown passes in a game with 11 against Eastern Washington. He completed the season with 5,140 yards and 54 touchdowns, outpacing Ware's totals from 1989, but fell short in the Heisman race, finishing fifth behind winner Ty Detmer and three others. Houston finished the season 10–1. Their only loss came against Texas. The Cougars were not allowed to go to a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions for violations under former coach Bill Yeoman. Jenkins' teams featured the nation's leading receiver each year from 1987 to 1992.\nThe Cougars started the 1991 season poised to pick up right where they left off. After routing Louisiana Tech 73–3 in the first game of the season, the next game was a nationally televised road game against the Miami Hurricanes. They lost 40–10. Houston won only seven more games during the remainder of Jenkins' tenure. He resigned under fire in the spring of 1993.\nCanadian Football League.\nAfter leaving Houston, Jenkins landed a job as a defensive backs coach with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Jenkins coached with a number of CFL teams before joining the Toronto Argonauts as the offensive coordinator. There Jenkins installed a new offense built around the strengths of quarterback, Doug Flutie. The Argonauts won the Grey Cup in 1997.\nFXFL.\nJenkins was appointed as head coach for the Fall Experimental Football League's Blacktips for the 2014 season. In 2015, he became the head coach of the Hudson Valley Fort. He quit that position midway through the season, citing payment and player safety problems.\nFCF.\nIn 2021, Jenkins signed as a coach with Fan Controlled Football."

        "title": "Jason Ferguson (American football)",
        "text": "Jason O. Ferguson (born November 28, 1974) is a former American football defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins. He was selected by the New York Jets in the seventh round of the 1997 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Georgia.\nEarly years.\nFerguson attended Nettleton High School in Nettleton, Mississippi. He earned varsity letters in football, as a center on the basketball team, and in track and field. In football, he was a two-time All-South and a three-time All-District honoree.\nCollege career.\nFerguson enrolled at Itawamba Community College. He was a two-time All-Area and an All-State honoree. As a sophomore in 1994, he also earned Junior College All-American status, after recording 88 tackles and 2.5 sacks.\nFerguson originally intended to go Ole Miss from Itawamba, but switched to Georgia in the final 72 hours before 1995 National Signing Day.\nPlaying for the Georgia Bulldogs in 1995 and 1996, he lined up next to Jermaine Smith in Georgia's defensive front. In a memorable game against Auburn, Ferguson sacked quarterback Dameyune Craig on fourth-and-3 in the fourth overtime, sealing Georgia's 56–49 win.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Jets.\nFalling to the seventh round of the 1997 NFL Draft, Ferguson was selected 229th overall by Bill Parcells' New York Jets. The Jets were the only club to invite him for a visit before the draft, because most teams apparently dissuaded from considering him after he was tested positive for marijuana at the pre-draft combine, reportedly being the only player to do so. Seventeen defensive tackles were taken ahead of him, including Darrell Russell and Renaldo Wynn in the first round. Parcells originally expressed reluctance to pick Ferguson at all, but trusted Georgia's head coach, Jim Donnan. Ferguson was signed to a two-year deal by the Jets only few days after the draft.\nIn his first season with the Jets, Ferguson shared time with veteran Ernie Logan at nose tackle, before replacing him as starter at the beginning of the 1998 NFL season. In 1999, Ferguson was suspended for four games after testing positive for steroids. After earning a $12 million contract during the 2000–2001 offseason, Ferguson tore his right rotator cuff during the first practice and missed all of the 2001 NFL season. He returned to the field to following season and played all games in 2002, 2003 and 2004.\nDallas Cowboys.\nA highly coveted free-agent in 2005, coming off a very strong 2004 season in which he totaled 59 tackles and 3½ sacks, Ferguson left the Jets for the Dallas Cowboys, rejoining Bill Parcells who had become their head coach in 2003. Ferguson was signed to a five-year, $21.5 million contract that included a $9 million signing bonus. A replacement for La'Roi Glover most of the season, Ferguson started three games in 2005. After Glover left for the Rams in 2006, Ferguson took over as full-time starter.\nFollowing a season-ending biceps injury in the Cowboys' victory over the New York Giants in Week 1 of the 2007 season, Ferguson lost his starting job to Jay Ratliff. That following off-season he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a sixth round draft pick in the 2009 NFL Draft (#197-Stephen Hodge). The teams also swapped their 2008 sixth-rounders (#167-Erik Walden), with the Cowboys moving up from the bottom third to the top of that round.\nMiami Dolphins.\nRejoining Bill Parcells on a third team, Ferguson became the Dolphins' starting nose tackle in 2008. He then appeared in all games and, as of November 2009, had compiled 55 tackles (33 solo). In 2008, the Dolphins' opponents averaged only 101.3 rushing yards per game, and 4.2 yards per carry.\nIn a game against the Carolina Panthers on November 19, Ferguson suffered a right knee injury that caused him to miss the rest of the 2009 NFL season. Considering his age and the fact that he was playing on the last year of his contract, it was believed that this injury would end his 13-year tenure as an NFL player because he planned to either re-sign with the Dolphins, or retire.\nOn March 6, 2010, Ferguson was suspended for the first eight games of the 2010 NFL season. He was penalized for taking steroids, the second time he failed the NFL drug test. Three days later, he re-signed with the Dolphins. However, on July 15, Ferguson announced his retirement from the NFL."

As such, the Homestead Grays challenged two teams from the NNL two distinct Series that were held over various stadiums and dates. The Grays challenged the St. Louis Stars in St. Louis on April 19 and April 22 and won twice. They challenged the Detroit Stars to four games held from August 21 to August 28 (two in Akron and two in Detroit), which Homestead won three. On August 30-September 3, they challenged the Stars to five games (all in St. Louis), and the Stars won four of five.

        "title": "Water polo at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Water polo has been part of the Summer Olympics program since the second games, in 1900. A women's water polo tournament was introduced for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Hungary has been the most successful country in men's tournament, while the United States is the only team to win multiple times at the women's tournament since its introduction. Italy is the first and only country to win both the men's and women's water polo tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe history of water polo as a team sport began in mid-19th century England and Scotland, where water sports were a feature of county fairs and festivals. Water polo has been included in every Summer Olympic Games as a men's competition sport, except 1896. Women's water polo made its debut in the Summer Olympics in 2000.\nBeginnings.\nMen's water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic Games in 1900. Seven European teams from four countries, including four from the host nation France, took part in the competition. The British team was the inaugural champion.\nAt the 1904 Summer Olympics, a water polo tournament was contested, three club teams of seven players each entered. A German team tried to enter, but its entry was refused because the players did not play for the same club. The event took place in a pond in Forest Park, the location of both the Olympics and the World's Fair. Previously, the International Olympic Committee and International Swimming Federation (FINA) considered the water polo event at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration sport. However, in July 2021, after accepting the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, the IOC recognized water polo along with several others as an official sport of the 1904 Olympic program. Water polo was not played at the 1906 Olympics.\nFrom 1908 to 1920, the Great Britain men's national water polo team won three consecutive gold medals at the Olympics, becoming the first water polo team to have an Olympic winning streak (winning three or more Olympic titles in a row).\nHungarian dominance.\nHungary men's national water polo team has participated in 22 of 27 Olympic tournaments, with fifteen Olympic medals (nine gold, three silver and three bronze). From 1928 to 1980, the Hungarians won twelve consecutive medals in water polo. Twenty years later, the team won three golds in a row between 2000 and 2008, becoming the second team to have an Olympic winning streak in water polo.\nBlood in the Water match.\nThe most famous water polo match in Olympic history often referred to as the \"Blood in the Water match\", was a 1956 Summer Olympics semi-final match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, played in Melbourne on 6 December 1956. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian revolution began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. The match was bloody and violent. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4–0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Soviet player Valentin Prokopov punching Hungarian player Ervin Zádor. Pictures of Zádor's injuries were published around the world, leading to the \"Blood in the Water\" moniker.\nThe Hungarians went on to win the Olympic gold medal by defeating Yugoslavia 2–1 in the final.\nAddition of women's program.\nWomen's water polo became an Olympic sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Six nations competed in the women's tournament with home team Australia winning the gold medal over the United States.\nFrom 2012 to 2021, the United States women's team won three consecutive gold medals at the Summer Olympics, becoming the first women's water polo team to have an Olympic winning streak.\nGeography.\nWater polo is now popular in many countries around the world, notably Europe (particularly in Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Spain), Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States.\nAs of the 2020 Summer Olympics, 51 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) from six continents have sent their water polo teams to the Olympic Games. Men's water polo teams of European NOCs won all 27 official tournaments, while women's teams from Europe, North America and Oceania won all six gold medals. Water polo teams from Africa, Asia and South America have not won an Olympic medal yet.\nVenues.\nFor the Summer Olympics, there are 34 venues that have been or will be used for water polo.\nThe Seine in Paris hosted the first water polo competitions at the 1900 Olympics. The Forest Park in St. Louis hosted the water polo events for the 1904 Summer Olympics.\nThe first water polo venue not located on a river or a lake took place at the 1908 London Olympics. It was not until the 1920 Olympics that a separate venue was created for the aquatic venues. The 1948 Games were the first Olympics in which water polo took place both indoors and in more than one venue. The first separate water polo venue that was not connected to other aquatic venues was at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\nThe Water Polo Arena of the 2012 London Olympics was the first dedicated water polo venue to be built for an Olympics, the structure was taken down after the games.\nSources:\nRules.\nQualification.\nSince 2012, the qualifying process consists of five stages:\nPlayers.\nEligibility.\nAccording to the \"FINA General Rules\", the list below shows the requirements for a player to be eligible to play in international tournaments:\nCompetition format.\nFor both the men's and women's tournaments at the 2020 Olympics (which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the competition consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage. Teams are placed into two groups, with each team playing each other team in its group once. Teams earn 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The top four teams in each group advance to the knockout rounds. The knockout rounds are a single-elimination tournament consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals, and the gold and bronze medal matches.\nMatches consist of four quarters of eight minutes each. During the knockout rounds, if the score is tied after four quarters (32 minutes), penalty shootouts, which is 5 rounds, plus extra rounds if tied, are used to determine the winner.\nSources:\nGame rules.\nMaximum number of players per team.\nSources:\nAnti-doping.\nThe FINA follows the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) regulations on performance-enhancing drugs. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies based on the number of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team.\nMen's tournament.\nResults summary.\nSources:\nTeam statistics.\nChampions (results, squads).\nChampions (results)&lt;br&gt;\nChampions (squads)&lt;br&gt;\nPlayer statistics.\nTop goalscorers (one match, one tournament, all-time).\nTop goalscorers (one match)\nTop goalscorers (one tournament)\nTop goalscorers (all-time)\nTop goalkeepers (one match, one tournament, all-time).\nTop goalkeepers (one match)\nTop goalkeepers (one tournament)\nTop goalkeepers (all-time)\nWomen's tournament.\nResults summary.\nSources:\nTeam statistics.\nChampions (results, squads).\nChampions (results)\nChampions (squads)\nPlayer statistics.\nTop goalscorers (one match, one tournament, all-time).\nTop goalscorers (one match)\nTop goalscorers (one tournament)\nTop goalscorers (all-time)\nTop goalkeepers (one match, one tournament, all-time).\nTop goalkeepers (one match)\nTop goalkeepers (one tournament)\nTop goalkeepers (all-time)\nOverall medal table.\nThe following table is pre-sorted by number of Olympic gold medals (in descending order), number of Olympic silver medals (in descending order), number of Olympic bronze medals (in descending order), name of the NOC (in ascending order), respectively.

        "title": "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002 TV series)",
        "text": "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is an animated television series. Developed for television by Michael Halperin, who created the original series, it was animated by Mike Young Productions. It served as an update of the 1980s Filmation series, produced to coincide with Mattel's revival of the Masters of the Universe franchise eleven years after its previous attempt. The series ran on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block between August 16, 2002, and January 10, 2004.\nUnlike the previous \"He-Man\" series, set on the futuristic planet of Primus, this version sought to return to the roots of the storyline and provide broader explorations never reached in the first series, including origins for each character, and some first-time animated debuts of familiar toyline faces. The series also brought back several writers from the original series, such as Larry DiTillio and Michael Reaves. Also, it is the second and final \"He-Man\" series to feature a Canadian voice cast with the exception of Cam Clarke.\nThe series has been noted for similarities it shares with the original series. For example, it has an homage intro to the Filmation series' intro speech, but in this version, teenager Prince Adam is interrupted by an explosion and invasion by Skeletor and his henchmen. Prince Adam transforms into He-Man when he says \"By the power of Grayskull... I have the power!\" (later episodes feature a chorus singing He-Man's name during the scene change). It also features \"scene change\" sequences, but only the one involving the Sword of Power was taken from the Filmation series; all the others were created for this series, and the sequences occur less frequently than on the previous series.\nSeries overview.\nSeason 1.\nThe series begins with an attack on the Council of Wisdom, but it is thwarted by Captain Randor and his men. Captain Randor engages in a swordfight with Keldor, who attempts to kill Randor with a vial of acid. Randor deflects the acid back into Keldor's face, causing him to sound the retreat. Zoar informs Captain Randor that the Council has vanished and declared Eternia to become a monarchy, with Captain Randor as king. Zoar also tells Captain Randor he will be responsible for a great hero, but immediately vanishes afterwards. Randor, perplexed by the lack of information, shouts, \"How will I know this hero?!\"\nYears later, Eternia has seen the end of tyranny and evil, and King Randor has married and ruled over a peaceful, prosperous people. Eternians are safe in the knowledge that their greatest threats are trapped behind the great barrier in the badlands near Snake Mountain. However, Skeletor finally breaks through the barrier and seeks to cause havoc once more, beginning with the capture of King Randor. Detecting the breach from within Castle Grayskull, the Sorceress informs Man-At-Arms, Randor's captain of the guards and a trustworthy ally, that the time has come for destiny to be fulfilled. Prince Adam, a spoiled, almost carefree heir-apparent to the throne of his father, Randor, is trained daily by the unrelenting Teela, his best friend. Adam is approached by Teela's father, Man-At-Arms, who takes Adam to Castle Grayskull. There, Adam learns from the Sorceress of an approaching evil which can only be defeated by someone destined to become the warrior He-Man, and is shocked to discover that he is the chosen one. Refusing to accept the responsibility, Adam returns home to find the palace in ruins, and that Skeletor's forces have captured his father. Adam, Man-At-Arms, and Teela pursue Randor's kidnappers into the forests, where they are ambushed. Adam is covered by Man-At-Arms as he returns to Grayskull, followed by his pet tiger Cringer, and the court magician Orko. His flight through the forest infuriates Teela, who only sees a coward leaving the scene of battle. Adam accepts his destiny, and is granted the Sword of Power, which he uses to become He-Man. With Cringer transforming into Battle Cat, a much larger beast strong enough to serve as a steed, He-Man returns to the scene of battle and rescues his father from Skeletor. Over the course of the first season, Randor's defenses expand, with many other fighters joining He-Man's cause. The Sorceress is revealed as the mother of Teela, whose ultimate destiny as the successor to the Sorceress manifests in small doses physically and mentally, often causing her pain or general befuddlement as she struggles to understand them. Skeletor becomes aware of Grayskull's power when he attacks it, prompting him to spend much of the season attempting to enter it. Hints are made as to the fate of Skeletor's mentor, Hordak, and the future main adversaries of the second season, the Snake Men. Much like the original series, selling toys was a key goal of this series, and He-Man and Skeletor would don variations of their costumes or different ones entirely whenever they were briefly \"empowered\" with an ancient relic or new technology. The first season ends on a cliffhanger in which Skeletor unites several of the other adversaries fought by the Heroic Masters into a grand council of evil. He captures most of the Masters, forcing He-Man and Teela to enter Snake Mountain. Adam becomes separated from his sword, and is soon forced to protect Castle Grayskull from Skeletor without it.\nSeason 2.\nAfter the events of the season one cliffhanger, which saw Orko returning the sword to Adam and the Heroic Masters rescued, the Snake Men take center stage as the main antagonists, having been hinted in the first season as being trapped beneath Snake Mountain (their own former stronghold) inside a void. They are finally liberated by allies existing outside of the void, as well as a treacherous Evil-Lyn. Adam is informed of their rising by the Sorceress and finds his He-Man armor completely different upon transformation, designed to fight the Snake Men, led by King Hiss. Skeletor would still appear from time to time, but would be gradually phased out, although had the series continued, he would have returned to his status as a major player.\nThis season was shorter than the first, and as a result, more serialized, with episodes following an established continuity. Characters were strongly developed, and old characters reintroduced, including Fisto, who was Man-At-Arms' brother and a disgraced soldier of the court who went AWOL during the last great war. The third episode of this season, \"Out of the Past,\" also reveals how the Sorceress, on a granted leave from her duties, nursed an amnesia-stricken soldier back to health and fell in love with him. The soldier left mysteriously before she gave birth, and his identity remains unknown; it is debated whether or not the soldier was Man-At-Arms or Fisto, or someone else entirely, calling Teela's parentage into question. The secret origins of Skeletor, Snake Mountain, and the power of Castle Grayskull itself, were also revealed.\nVoice cast.\nThe voice director for the series is Michael Donovan.\nDVD releases.\nBCI Eclipse LLC (under license from Mattel Entertainment) released the entire series on DVD in Region 1, for the very first time, in three volume sets in 2008. Each volume contained an extensive array of special features including documentaries, commentaries, DVD-ROM features, end of episode morals, photo galleries and more. In December 2008, BCI Eclipse ceased operations, as a result all releases are now out of print.\nIn June 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to the series and subsequently released \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe - The Complete Series\", a 4-disc box set featuring all 39 episodes of the series on DVD in Region 1 on September 29, 2009. They also released a 10-episode single disc best of DVD on the same day.\nTo commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Masters of the Universe\" brand, Mill Creek Entertainment released the \"30th Anniversary Commemorative Collection of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" DVD in December 2012. The 22-disc set features all 130 episodes of the 1983 series, 20 fan-favorite episodes of the 1990 series, as well as all 39 episodes of the 2002 series.\nComic book.\nTo coincide with the release of the series, a \"He-Man\" comic was created by MV Creations. Three separate series were released between 2002–2004: two mini-series, a short-lived ongoing series and a handful of one-shots were published. Some of these were collected into trade paperback graphic novels. The tone and maturity of the comic was slightly different from the cartoon, as the writers hoped to appeal to the older demographic purchasing the comic. The comic ultimately came to a close when Mattel began to end the licensing program for the Masters of the Universe relaunch. The comics were published by Image Comics, then MV Creations themselves (through Crossgen Comics), before eventually going back to Image Comics. MV Creations also made several minicomics which were included with a few of the 200X action figures; they also created a comic of the unproduced episode 40 of the cartoon series, based on Dean Stefan's original screenplay. In the comic - \"Captured\" - Skeletor retakes Snake Mountain, King Hiss recovers from his injuries after his defeat at the hands of Zodak, and Man-At-Arms is transformed back into a Snake Man."

        "title": "Braves TBS Baseball",
        "text": "Braves TBS Baseball (or Braves Baseball on TBS) was an American presentation of regular season Major League Baseball (MLB) game telecasts featuring the Atlanta Braves National League franchise that aired on the American cable and satellite network TBS. The games were produced by Turner Sports, the sports division of the Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary of Time Warner, TBS's corporate parent. The program, which debuted in 1973, ended national broadcasts in 2007.\nTBS phased out its national coverage of Braves baseball after it was awarded an MLB-wide national broadcast contract effective in 2008. WPCH-TV, the rebranded former originating signal of the TBS superstation feed, retained Atlanta-market rights to a partial schedule of Braves games through 2013, but primary rights moved to cable regional sports networks, eventually settling with Fox Sports South (now Bally Sports South). TBS may select Braves games for national broadcast on equal grounds with other MLB clubs, but their national broadcast would be blacked out in the Braves' MLB-designated territory if the regional rights-holder carries the game as well.\nHistory.\n1970s.\nCoverage of the Atlanta Braves was perhaps TBS's signature program during its early years. Ted Turner – who had purchased WJRJ-TV (channel 17) in January 1970 (changing its call letters to WTCG shortly after the sale was finalized), when the station was simply a UHF independent station available primarily within the Atlanta market – shocked Atlanta media observers by acquiring the rights to Braves games after the 1972 season, taking them from NBC affiliate WSB-TV (channel 2, now an ABC affiliate), which had carried the team's games since the Braves moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee in 1966 (WSB-TV's sister AM radio station held the radio broadcast rights to the games for years afterward). The acquisition of television rights to the Braves was particularly striking given that WTCG had experienced major profit losses ever since Turner took over the station; channel 17's revenue was only then starting to break even and the station became more competitive among the Atlanta market's television outlets ratings-wise. Braves games began airing on WTCG during the 1973 season.\nEven more astonishing, a few years later, Turner would buy the team outright before the 1976 season, mainly to keep a programming staple of his in Atlanta. Before the purchase, rumors had spread alleging that the Braves' owners were looking to move the franchise to another city, following dismal stadium attendance during the 1974 and 1975 seasons, after the excitement of Hank Aaron hitting his then-record-breaking 715th home run (on April 8, 1974) wore off.\nDuring the 1970s, Turner syndicated live games to stations (mostly major network affiliates, as the region had few independent stations) throughout Georgia and adjoining states, including Turner-owned WRET (now WCNC-TV) in Charlotte, North Carolina, as WSB-TV had previously done. Usually, the Sunday afternoon game and one game that aired during prime time were provided to these stations, with mid-week game telecasts airing mainly during the summer, when the major networks were airing reruns, a normal practice among the other MLB teams during that era. Also by the mid-1970s, WTCG had already become available on many cable systems in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina via microwave relay transmission by the mid-1970s, giving the team even further television exposure to its loyal fanbase in the South.\nA landmark event for WTCG occurred on December 17, 1976, when Turner uplinked the station's signal to the Satcom 1 satellite for distribution to cable providers throughout the United States; as a result, Braves telecasts began airing nationally with the 1977 season. When WTCG reached a significant penetration of Southern U.S. households with cable television service around 1978-1979, Turner discontinued syndicating the team's game broadcasts, making the Braves the first team not to provide live coverage of its games to broadcast television stations outside of those within the team's home market.\nTurner once famously tried to get Andy Messersmith to use his #17 jersey to promote Superstation WTBS during its early years; the back of the jersey read, \"CHANNEL 17.\" Major League Baseball immediately stopped this plan as, according to MLB rules, team jerseys are not allowed to incorporate advertisements other than that of the jersey's manufacturer.\n1980s and early 1990s.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the Braves game telecasts on TBS received high ratings, usually garnering around a 2.0 or sometimes an even higher ratings share. Around this time, the station referred to the franchise as \"America's team\" in a promotional campaign.\nWTBS petitioned for the rights to produce a locally originated broadcast of the 1982 National League Championship Series, in which the Braves played against the St. Louis Cardinals. Following a decision from the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Major League Baseball blocked it from carrying the series on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS could not have the rights to a national telecast that competed with network coverage of the NLCS, which was carried that year by ABC. After the 1983 season, Major League Baseball no longer permitted local television stations to produce their own League Championship Series broadcasts (a point made moot by the fact that the games were already available over-the-air).\nIn 1997, TBS began to collect subscriber fees directly from cable providers, effectively resulting in the national feed operating under the conventions of a conventional basic cable network, though it still technically was designated as a superstation. In exchange, TBS began to lease advertising slots to providers to carry local commercial inserts; as a result, the TBS superstation feed began to televise fewer regular season Atlanta Braves games to a national audience.\n2000s.\n2003.\nIn 2003, the Braves telecasts on TBS underwent significant changes for the first time in many years. Don Sutton and Joe Simpson assumed duties as lead commentators, while longtime play-by-play announcers Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren had their roles on the broadcasts reduced. The telecasts were also rebranded from \"Braves Baseball on TBS\" to \"Major League Baseball on TBS\" (before reverting to the previous title the following year).\nThese changes reflected an increase in the network's rights fee payments to Major League Baseball. In turn, national sponsors could fulfill their advertising commitments by purchasing ads on TBS, in addition to ESPN or Fox. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, Atlanta area media outlets and team manager Bobby Cox. Over 90% of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" newspaper preferred the team of Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts. The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After that year's All-Star break, TBS brought back Caray and Van Wieren to work with the two analysts.\n\"Braves TBS Xtra\".\nBeginning in 2004, some TBS telecasts (mostly those airing on Fridays or Saturdays) became more enhanced. The network branded its interactive telecasts as Braves TBS Xtra, which Braves broadcaster Skip Caray would refer to simply as \"one of those super duper telecasts\". Enhancements featured in the broadcasts included a catcher cam, \"Xtra Motion\" showing the type of pitch and its movement, and the \"leadOff Line\". Often, a guest analyst would join the main announcers in the broadcast booth; telecasts also featured inside access to players including discussions between players and coaching staff while the game was ongoing.\n2006.\nWhile just carrying 70 Braves games on TBS, the Turner Broadcasting System sold Turner South to Fox Sports, and allowed them keep the games (Turner South had been carrying Braves games in order to ensure that the channel would receive wide distribution in the Southeastern U.S.). Afterward, Braves game presentations on Turner South (which was rebranded as SportSouth later that year to distinguish it from its new sister network) and FSN South adopted a uniform on-air appearance and began using the same announcers. FSN South's 25-game package (with telecasts usually airing on Wednesdays) is a vestige of its days as the \"former\" SportSouth (which was launched by Turner in the early 1990s), as well as a means to ensure that ESPN's game broadcasts would generally be the only one televised nationwide on Wednesdays without requiring a subscription to the MLB Extra Innings out-of-market sports package.\nAs a result of Turner's decision to allow FSN to broadcast over 85 games per season, TBS no longer served as the Braves' primary broadcaster. Coupled with the impending sale of the team, Pete Van Wieren stated, \"It's like an end of an era.\" At the end of the 2006 season, Turner Sports decided not to renew analyst Don Sutton's contract with the network, while Ron Gant joined FSN South/SportSouth on a full-time basis; as a result, Joe Simpson would be the main analyst for all Braves telecasts.\nHigh definition.\nDuring the 2006 season, all Braves home games airing on TBS began to be broadcast in high definition over the digital signal of WTBS within the Atlanta and on cable providers throughout the Southeastern U.S. (such as Comcast and Charter Communications). The cable deals were not renewed as none of the TBS home games were broadcast in HD during the 2007 season (all home games airing on FSN South/SportSouth were presented in HD on both cable and satellite). TBS's assumption of rights to a national MLB television package resulted in the creation of a dedicated HD feed for the national version.\n2007 and beyond.\nThe 2007 season marked the last year that Braves baseball games aired on TBS over a fully national feed, covering 70 Braves games as in recent years. From 2008 to 2013, WPCH-TV – the former originating feed of TBS, which was rebranded as \"Peachtree TV\" as part of the October 2007 separation of the Atlanta station and its superstation feed – ran 45 Braves games per season in the Atlanta market, which were available for broadcast in the Braves regional territory and on regional sports network Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast. The remaining games aired on FSN South or SportSouth, meaning the Braves telecasts reverted to primarily regional coverage, as most other teams have done ever since recent expansions gave MLB a virtually nationwide footprint.\nDue to licensing requirements set by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that prevented the national cable feed of TBS to be carried in Canada (as only the local Atlanta feed was designated as an eligible-for-carriage superstation), WPCH remains available on Canadian cable and satellite providers as a designated superstation, allowing Braves games aired by WPCH to continue to be seen outside of the Atlanta area. This move left WGN America – the national feed of Chicago-based WGN-TV – as the only superstation to broadcast games from local sports teams to a national audience until 2021 (since then no local sports teams are broadcast to National audiences).\nTBS had previously announced a broadcast rights agreement to air those same 45 games nationally, before it signed a new contract to air Sunday afternoon regular season and postseason games nationally one year earlier in June 2006, an announcement that was made during the 2006 MLB All-Star Game. A limited number of these nationally televised games have included the Braves – which have appeared on a few of the game telecasts since 2008.\nAfter 32 years, the final Braves baseball telecast on TBS aired on September 30, 2007, in which the Braves lost in an away game against the Houston Astros, 3–0. During the final broadcast, play-by-play announcer Skip Caray thanked fans saying, \"To all you people who have watched the Braves for these 30 years ... thank you. We appreciate you more than you will ever know. ... Thank you folks and God bless you. And we're going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us.\"\nBraves games continued to air locally within the Atlanta market until 2013, when Fox Sports South – which had been producing the games for WPCH since the station's operations were turned over to the Meredith Corporation, former owner of Atlanta's CBS affiliate WGCL-TV (channel 46), under a local marketing agreement in 2011 – acquired the regional television rights to the station's 45-game package beginning with the 2014 season, ending WPCH's relationship with the Braves after 40 years.\nBlackouts.\nDue to broadcasting restrictions imposed by Major League Baseball, most Braves games airing on TBS were blacked out within about air miles of the opposing team's stadium, meaning games that were available on local television (except for within the Atlanta area, where WTBS was the exclusive station for Atlanta Braves games that did not air on FSN South or SportSouth) were not seen on local cable providers within the blackout region. This blackout rule was somewhat less restrictive than that for ESPN, which covers the entirety of a team's designated market area."

        "title": "Jeff Brown (ice hockey, born 1966)",
        "text": "Jeff Randall Brown (born April 30, 1966) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. During his career, Brown was considered to be in the upper echelon of NHL defencemen. He was selected to play in the 1992 NHL All-Star Game and still holds many offensive records for the St. Louis Blues.\nPlaying career.\nJunior hockey.\nBrown joined the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) when he was selected in the first round, second overall, in the 1982 OHL Priority Draft. In his first season with Sudbury in 1982–83, Brown appeared in 65 games, scoring nine goals and 46 points, leading the Wolves defense in scoring, and finishing fifth in overall team scoring. However, the rebuilding club failed to qualify for the post-season. In 1983–84, Brown saw a big increase in his offensive numbers, as he scored 17 goals and 77 points in 68 games, finishing second in team scoring. However, the club failed to qualify for the post-season. Brown led the Wolves in scoring during the 1984–85 season with 64 points, scoring 16 goals and 48 assists in 56 games. Sudbury missed the playoffs once again. In 1985–86, Brown missed 21 games, but he scored 22 goals, a career high in the OHL, and had 50 points, helping Sudbury reach the playoffs for the first and only time in his junior career. In four playoff games, Brown had two assists, as the Wolves were swept by the Guelph Platers in the first round. Brown was awarded the Max Kaminsky Trophy, awarded to the most outstanding defenseman in the OHL, and was named to the OHL First All-Star team.\nProfessional career.\nQuebec Nordiques.\nBrown was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the second round, 36th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft held at the Montreal Forum. Brown saw limited action with the Nordiques during the 1985–86 season, appearing in eight games, scoring three goals and five points. In one playoff game, Brown was held off the scoresheet. Brown also appeared in one post-season game with the Nordiques AHL affiliate, the Fredericton Express, getting no points.\nHe began the 1986–87 season with the Express, appearing in 26 games, scoring two goals and 16 points, before being promoted to Quebec. Brown finished the 1986–87 season with the Nordiques, scoring seven goals and 29 points in 44 games, providing the club with some much needed offense. In 11 playoff games, Brown scored three goals and six points in 13 games, as the Nordiques lost to their provincial rivals, the Montreal Canadiens in seven games in the Adams Division final. Brown spent the entire 1987–88 season with the Nordiques, appearing in 78 games, scoring 16 goals and 53 points, the most among Nordiques defensemen, and fifth on the team; however, the club failed to reach the post-season.\nIn 1988–89, Brown continued to put up very high offensive numbers, scoring 21 goals and 68 points in 78 games, again leading Nordiques defensemen in scoring, and had the third highest total on the club. The rebuilding Nordiques, however, missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Brown began the 1989–90 season with Quebec, as in 29 games, he scored six goals and 16 points. On December 13, 1989, the Nordiques traded Brown to the St. Louis Blues for Tony Hrkac and Greg Millen.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nBrown finished the 1989-90 season with the St. Louis Blues, as he continued to put up very solid offensive numbers, scoring 10 goals and 38 points in 48 games, helping the Blues reach the post-season. In the playoffs, Brown scored two goals and 12 points in 12 games, as the Blues lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in seven games in the Norris Division final. In 1990–91, Brown led the Blues defense in scoring, as he had 12 goals and 59 points in 67 games, as he missed nearly a month of the season due to broken left ankle, and was third in overall team scoring, only behind Brett Hull and Adam Oates, as the Blues finished with the second best record in the league, getting 105 points. In the playoffs, Brown continued to be very productive, scoring three goals and 12 points in 13 games, but the Blues were upset by the Minnesota North Stars in the Norris Division final, losing in six games.\nBrown scored at least 20 goals for the second time of his career in 1991–92, as in 80 games, he had 20 goals and 59 points, again leading the Blues defense in scoring, and tied for fourth for team scoring, as St. Louis reached the post-season once again. The 20 goals tied Larry Sacharuk's team record. In the playoffs, Brown had two goals and three points in six games, as the Blues lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the playoffs. In 1992–93, Brown had the best season of his career, setting a career high with 25 goals and 78 points in 71 games, leading the Blues defense in scoring again, and fourth on the team, despite missing 13 games due to a broken foot. The 25 goals establish a new single-season team record for defencemen that still holds. In the playoffs, Brown had three goals and 11 points in 11 games, tied for second in overall team scoring, as the club swept the heavily favoured Chicago Blackhawks in the first round of the playoffs, before losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games in the Norris Division final.\nBrown began the 1993–94 season with St. Louis, appearing in 68 games, scoring 13 goals and 60 points, leading the defense in scoring for the fourth straight season. On March 21, 1994, the Blues traded Brown, Bret Hedican and Nathan LaFayette to the Vancouver Canucks for Craig Janney.\nVancouver Canucks.\nBrown finished 1993–94 with the Canucks after his late season trade, appearing in 11 games with the team, scoring a goal and six points. In the playoffs, Brown had a memorable performance, as he scored six goals and 15 points in 24 games, leading the Canucks defense in scoring, as Vancouver lost to the New York Rangers in seven games in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn the lockout shortened 1994–95 season, Brown appeared in 33 games with Vancouver, scoring eight goals and 31 points, finishing fourth in overall team scoring, despite missing 15 games due to a cracked bone in his wrist after being slashed by Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings, and a separated shoulder late in the season. Brown appeared in only five of eleven playoff games for Vancouver due to a thigh injury, scoring a goal and four points, as the Canucks were swept by the Blackhawks in the second round of the playoffs. Brown started the 1995–96 season with Vancouver, appearing in 28 games, as he scored only one goal, and 17 points. On December 19, 1995, the Canucks traded Brown and their third round draft pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft to the Hartford Whalers for Jim Dowd, Frantisek Kucera and the Whalers second round pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft.\nHartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes.\nBrown finished the 1995–96 season with the Hartford Whalers, appearing in 48 games, scoring seven goals and 38 points to lead the team defense in scoring, but the Whalers failed to reach the post-season. During the season opener of the 1996–97 season against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Brown suffered from a back injury, which required season-ending disc fusion surgery, causing him to miss the entire season. In his only game, he was held off the scoresheet.\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Whalers franchise relocated and became the Carolina Hurricanes for the 1997–98 season. In 32 games with the Hurricanes, Brown struggled offensively, scoring three goals and 13 points. On December 20, 1997, Brown suffered a deep gash in his shin from a Washington Capitals players skate, resulting the injury be stitched up, as Brown was able to return to action. On January 2, 1998, the Hurricanes traded Brown to the Toronto Maple Leafs for the Maple Leafs fourth round draft pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. This trade was made the day before Kirk McLean was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks. (Brown's son Logan, later to become a first-round pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, was born in Raleigh two months later as Brown's family stayed behind following the mid-season trade.)\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nAfter playing three games with the Toronto Maple Leafs following his trade from the Carolina Hurricanes, the shin injury that Brown suffered while playing with the Hurricanes was not healing very well, and Brown began experiencing severe chills and became very ill. He asked Toronto trainers if he could go home, but trainers Chris Broadhurst and Brent Smith spotted something wrong with the scar on his leg. Its inflammation appeared to be spreading to other parts of the body. Broadhurst and Smith insisted that Brown see a doctor, but by the time he got there, he was already in shock. Unsure what was wrong, the trainers then rushed him to the hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery. They found a potentially deadly virus related to the flesh-eating bacteria, had entered the infected area of Brown's leg. The surgery saved Brown's life, and he returned to action for Toronto's February 4, 1998, game against the St. Louis Blues. Brown would appear in 19 games with the Maple Leafs during the 1997–98 season, scoring a goal and nine points. His time in Toronto would be short, as the Leafs traded Brown to the Washington Capitals for Sylvain Cote on March 24, 1998.\nWashington Capitals.\nBrown finished the 1997–98 season with the Capitals, earning six assists in nine games with the club, as Washington reached the playoffs. In the post-season, Brown was limited to two games due to headaches, as he earned two assists. The Capitals reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Detroit Red Wings.\nAfter the season, Brown became a free agent but retired from playing after he was unable to find a new team to sign with.\nCoaching career.\nMissouri River Otters.\nBrown coached the Missouri River Otters of the United Hockey League (UHL) during the 2005–06 season, replacing head coach Kevin Kaminski, who was fired after the team began the season with an 11-27-3 record. Under Brown, the River Otters improved, going 13-18-4; however, the club failed to make the playoffs. After the season, the River Otters folded.\nSt. Louis Bandits.\nBrown began coaching the St. Louis Bandits of the North American Hockey League (NAHL). In his first season with the club in 2008–09, the Bandits had a record of 42-9-7, winning the South Division. In the playoffs, the Bandits won the Robertson Cup, defeating the Wenatchee Wild in the final game. It was the third consecutive season that St. Louis won the championship. In 2009–10, the Bandits finished second in the South Division, going 44-11-3, however, the club struggled in the playoffs, and failed to win the championship, as the club finished in fifth in the Nationals.\nThe Bandits had another very successful regular season in 2010–11, going 41-13-4, and winning the North Division. In the post-season, the Bandits lost to the Michigan Warriors in the second round, losing in the fifth and deciding game. St. Louis had another elite regular season in 2011–12, going 42-15-3, and winning the Midwest Division. In the playoffs, the Bandits lost to the Texas Tornados in the championship game, losing 4-3 in overtime.\nDue to lack of attendance, the club became dormant, and in 2013, the franchise was sold to the ownership of the Minnesota Wilderness.\nIndiana Ice.\nBrown took over as head coach of the Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League (USHL) for the last part of the 2012–13 season, however, the Ice failed to qualify for the post-season, as the club finished with a 21-37-7 record. In 2013–14, Brown led the Ice to a 42-11-7 record, first place in the Eastern Conference. In the post-season, the Ice won the Clark Cup, defeating the Waterloo Black Hawks in five games to claim the championship.\nOttawa 67's.\nBrown became the eighth head coach in Ottawa 67's history, for the 2014–15 season, taking over a rebuilding club that had missed the playoffs the previous two seasons. In his first season with the 67's, Brown led the team back into the post-season, with a 38-25-5 record, earning him the OHL's third All-Star team coach. In the post-season, the 67's lost to the Niagara IceDogs in the first round, losing in six games.\nIn the summer of 2015 Brown became both head coach and general manager, replacing Pat Higgins, who became the team's head scout. On April 25, 2017, Brown announced his resignation from the 67's as the team's head coach and general manager, due to personal reasons.\nPersonal.\nHe is married to Laina and they have three children together, Jenna-Rose, Logan, and Caden. Logan also plays hockey and was drafted 11th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 2016 NHL Draft."

        "title": "Italy national baseball team",
        "text": "The Italy national baseball team represents Italy in international baseball competitions. The Italian national team was ranked 16th in the world as of 2022. The team is managed by Mike Piazza, a former New York Mets player and Major League Baseball Hall of Fame inductee.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nTeam Italia competed in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in , though with a much more Americanized roster than the team ordinarily uses in international play. Of the 30 players on Italy's roster, 23 were born in the United States. A player is eligible to participate on a World Baseball Classic team if:\n2006.\nItaly competed in Pool D, which included Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Australia. All games during round one for Pool D were played at The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.\nItaly secured an impressive 10–0 win over Australia in its first game, invoking the mercy rule after seven innings. However, they dropped their next two games to Venezuela, 6–0, and the Dominican Republic, 8–3, and failed to qualify for the second round of the tournament.\n2009.\nWith only ten players on their roster with any major league affiliation, Italy was a heavy underdog in Pool C of the 2009 World Baseball Classic. With Canada, the U.S.A. &amp; Venezuela completing Pool C, it was arguably the toughest pool in the WBC.\nPrior to the start of the WBC, Italy played two spring training games against the Washington Nationals and New York Mets. Italy trailed through most of the game against the Nationals until Chris Denorfia and Michael Costanzo drove in a run apiece in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning two-run home run by Valentino Pascucci tied the game at six. A ninth-inning walk-off three-run home run by Roger Bernadina capped off a late rally in the Nats' 9–6 victory over Italy.\nAgainst the Mets, Italy led 2–0 going into the ninth inning. Cory Sullivan hit a two-run home run to tie the game at two, and Jeremy Reed doubled in Daniel Murphy to give the Mets a 3–2 victory.\nItaly was again shut out by Venezuela in their first WBC game, 7–0 on March 7. Starter Mark DiFelice held Venezuela scoreless through the first four innings; however, Venezuela immediately took advantage of Italy's less experienced bullpen, exploding for 4 runs in the fifth.\nAgainst Canada on March 9, Italy pulled off one of the more surprising upsets in the 2009 WBC, winning 6–2, and eliminating the heavily favored Canadian team. Italy led 3–0 heading into the fourth inning, until Canada jumped on starter Dan Serafini for two runs. With the bases loaded and only one out, reliever Chris Cooper struck out Peter Orr, then got Chris Barnwell to fly out to center to end the threat, and keep Italy in the lead. In all, Italy's bullpen pitched six innings without giving up a run.\nWith this victory, Italy faced their nemeses, Venezuela, a second time. After three scoreless innings pitched by Italian starter Adam Ottavino, Venezuela again dominated Italy's bullpen, scoring four runs in the fourth, and five in the fifth to win 10–1, and eliminate Italy from the World Baseball Classic.\n2013.\nAgain considered a heavy underdog, Italy won its first two games in Pool D, 6–5 with a 9th-inning comeback over Mexico and 14–4 over Canada in a game called in the 8th inning due to the mercy rule. They lost both games in Round 2 against the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, thus eliminating them from the tournament.\n2017.\nAfter a win 10–9 against Mexico, and defeats 11–10 against Venezuela, and 9–3 against Puerto Rico, Italy clinched qualification for the next WBC in 2021.\nOlympic Games.\nItaly failed to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing for the first time since baseball became an official Olympic sport in 1992. Italy's best finish in an Olympics is sixth place, which they did in both 1996 and 2000. The first time an actual baseball tournament was held at an Olympics in , Italy finished with a 1–2 record, with its only victory coming against the Dominican Republic. There was no official placing as Baseball at the 1984 Summer Olympics was a demonstration sport.\nAt the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on July 8, , baseball and softball were voted out of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, becoming the first sports voted out of the Olympics since polo was eliminated from the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nBecause Team Italy finished in the top five in the 2019 European Baseball Championship it moved on to the 2020 Olympics qualifiers, in Italy September 18–22.\nIBAF Amateur World Series, Baseball World Cup, and WBSC Premier12.\nItaly's best finish in the Amateur World Series has been fourth place, which they did in . In , the event became known as the International Baseball Federation's (IBAF) World Cup. Italy's best finish in a Baseball World Cup is also fourth place, which they did when they served as the host nation in . Italy also hosted the and games. The 2009 IBAF World Cup was hosted by Europe. It was the first time in history the World Cup was hosted by a whole continent rather than an individual country.\n2007 IBAF World Cup.\nOn November 9, , Italy handed the U.S.A. team their only loss in Team U.S.A.'s route to win the 2007 Baseball World Cup in Taiwan. It was the U.S.'s first loss to Italy in 21 years and the first time it ever lost to Italy with professional players, as the team consisted of Major League Baseball players and top minor league prospects.\nBoth Italy and Panama ended up with 3–4 records in the 2007 games; however, Panama's 5.85 run ratio versus Italy's 4.73 placed them in fifth place while Italy settled for sixth.\n2009.\nThe 2009 Baseball World Cup took place from September 9–27. Seven European countries hosted and participant in the tournament of 22 teams. The event was made up of five groups consisting of four teams each, for a total of 20 teams. Italy (Bollate, Bologna, Codogno, Florence, Godo, Macerata, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, San Marino, Torino, Trieste, Verona, and Vicenza) and Netherlands (Rotterdam, Haarlem and Amsterdam) serve as hosts of the 16 teams of the second round (September 14–20), and therefore received first round byes. The groups were as follows:\nThe group Italy hosted in the second round included Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles and the U.S.A.. Italy's first three match-ups against Chinese Taipei, Mexico, and Australia all resulted in losses. Their first victory came against Japan on September 18. Italy lost two more to Canada and the U.S.A. before winning their final game against Netherlands Antilles. Italy finished the second round with a 2–5 record, and were eliminated.\nItaly hosted the final round from September 22–27 in Grosseto, Nettuno, Anzio, Matino, Caserta, Messina, Palermo and Rome, consisting of eight teams. Team USA won the gold medal game of the 2009 IBAF World Cup in Nettuno 10–5 over Cuba.\nIntercontinental Cup.\nThe Intercontinental Cup is another international baseball competition sponsored by the IBAF. Italy hosted the first ever Intercontinental Cup in , and finished in sixth place. Italy's best finish ever was third place, which they did in the games.\n2006.\nIn the tournament held in Taichung, Taiwan November 9–19, , Italy finished sixth. They secured an impressive 13–3 victory over Chinese Taipei in their first game of the tournament, however, they lost their next three match-ups to Netherlands, Cuba, and Australia (13 innings). After coming back with a victory against the Philippines, Italy lost their next two to Japan and South Korea to end the round robin first phase of the tournament with a 2–5 record.\nItaly came back to beat South Korea in the first game of the following round, 8–3. In the battle for fifth place, Italy lost to Australia, 3–2.\n2010.\nItaly beat Chinese Taipei 4–3 in the bronze medal game, gaining the first medal in its International Cup history.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\nThe European Baseball Championship is the main championship tournament between national baseball teams in Europe, governed by the WBSC Europe.

They are the only triplefins not to spend most of their time resting on the bottom, instead swimming in loose schools of up to hundreds of individuals above rocky reefs. When swimming their head is higher than the tail, giving rise to their common name.\nIts length is between 5 and 8 cm. The body is orange-brown with a red tinged head, a black eye, and a wide black lengthwise stripe on each flank.

        "text": "Jewel box is a term sometimes used in reference to the group of Major League Baseball ballparks built (or re-built) primarily between 1909 and 1915, after the wooden ballpark era and before the modern multipurpose stadium era. These parks featured two-tier grandstand design to take advantage of the steel structural supports and often squeezed inside a city block bringing fans right on top of the action. The \"retro\" ballparks constructed in the 1990s (and later) were an attempt to capture, to some degree, the perceived intimacy and baseball focus of these parks.\nJewel box ballparks by city.\nHere is a list of the Jewel Box ballparks, their dates of use as a Major League Baseball facility^ (see note below), and some indication of their remnants, if known:\nBoston\nBrooklyn\nChicago\nCincinnati\nCleveland\nDetroit\nNew York\nPhiladelphia\nPittsburgh\nSt. Louis\nWashington\n^Unless otherwise noted, first and last years listed include entire baseball season in that year.\nNight baseball – lights added.\nJewel Box Parks were used during the era that saw the Major Leagues begin playing games at night.

        "title": "List of first-class cricket quadruple centuries",
        "text": "A quadruple century (an individual score of 400 runs or more) has been scored eleven times in first-class cricket by nine different players. It was first achieved in 1895 by Archie MacLaren, playing for Lancashire against Somerset, while the most recent occurrence was by Sam Northeast. Brian Lara is the only player to have managed the feat in Test cricket. Lara holds the record for the highest score in first-class cricket, having made 501 not out in 1994. Bill Ponsford is the only other player to have scored two quadruple centuries, doing so in 1923 and 1927 for the Victoria cricket team. Ponsford's scores were both made at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, making it one of two venues to have hosted two quadruple centuries, along with the County Ground, Taunton. Two teams have conceded two quadruple centuries; Somerset and Queensland.\nDon Bradman's score of 452 not out was made in the shortest time of all quadruple centuries; his innings lasting 415 minutes (6 hours and 55 minutes). Lara's Test quadruple was the longest, taking 778 minutes (12 hours and 58 minutes). Bradman's quadruple century was also the only one to be scored in a team's second batting innings. Three of the quadruple centuries were made in each of Australia and England, two in Pakistan, one in India and one in Antigua and Barbuda.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1895, the highest score in first-class cricket was W. G. Grace's 344. This total was surpassed by Archie MacLaren, playing for Lancashire during a County Championship match against Somerset. MacLaren opened the batting for his side at the County Ground, Taunton, and struck 1 six and 64 fours during his innings, which lasted well into the second day of the three-day match. MacLaren's score of 424 remained the only quadruple century for over 25 years, until Bill Ponsford accumulated 429 runs in his third first-class match. Ponsford improved on his own record four years later, reaching 437 runs; both of his quadruple centuries were scored at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The next quadruple century was again scored in Australia, on this occasion by Don Bradman. Playing at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Bradman passed Ponsford's total, finishing on 452 not out. His innings, which lasted 415 minutes, is the quickest of any quadruple century.\nThe next three quadruple centuries were scored in the Indian subcontinent, where according to MacLaren's biographer Michael Down \"standards of play are sometimes hard to assess\". B. B. Nimbalkar was the first batsman to score a quadruple century without setting a new record for the highest score, hitting 443 not out for Maharashtra at Poona Club Ground. Maharashtra's opposition, Kathiawar, conceded the match on the third day without batting for a second time. Nimbalkar so far is the only player to have scored a first-class quadruple century but completed his career without ever playing an international match. In 1959, Hanif Mohammad, who later became Pakistan's Test captain, eclipsed Bradman's record, scoring 499 runs before he was run out. Playing at the Karachi Parsi Institute Ground, he was trying to reach 500 runs before the end of the third day when he was run out in the final over. Fifteen years later, Aftab Baloch, also from Pakistan, became the sixth player to score a quadruple century. Captaining Sind at the National Stadium, Karachi, Baloch scored 428.\nIn 1988, Graeme Hick made the second quadruple century in England. Coming 93 years after the first, it was similarly scored at the County Ground, Taunton. In an innings which Vic Marks described as \"clinical rather than charismatic\", Hick reached 405 not out from 469 deliveries: his first 300 runs came from 411 balls, and the last hundred were scored off 58 more. England was once again the host nation for the next quadruple century—which became a quintuple century—when Brian Lara made the record high score in first-class cricket, hitting 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham in 1994. In contrast to Hick's patient innings, Lara's total was one of only two quadruple centuries that were scored at faster than a run a minute.It is also, to date the only quadruple century scored by a batsman outside his home country. In a match that had been ruined as a contest by rain, Lara asked his captain not to declare their innings so he could try to surpass Hanif Mohammad's total. Aiming for 500, he started the final over of the day on 497, and reached the landmark with a four, scored from the penultimate ball of the over.\nTen years later, Lara became the only batsman to score a quadruple century in Test cricket when he scored 400 not out while captaining the West Indies against England at the Antigua Recreation Ground. When he passed Matthew Hayden's Test record score of 380, play was delayed as Baldwin Spencer, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, came onto the field to offer his congratulations. Lara continued to bat until he reached 400.\nIn July 2022, Sam Northeast scored 410 not out for Glamorgan against Leicestershire. Northeast, aged 32, had not yet played an international match of any kind."

        "title": "Sunday Night Baseball",
        "text": "Sunday Night Baseball is an exclusive weekly telecast of a Major League Baseball game that airs Sundays at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT on ESPN during the regular season.\nThe games are preceded most weeks by the studio show \"Baseball Tonight: Sunday Night Countdown presented by Chevrolet\" prior to the first pitch. A few telecasts each season appear on ESPN2 rather than ESPN due to conflicts with other programming; however, starting in 2022, ESPN2 will also air \"Sunday Night Baseball\" with alternate commentary for eight games per season.\nHistory.\nJon Miller-Joe Morgan era (1990–2010).\nThe series debuted on April 15, 1990 with coverage of New York Mets against the Montreal Expos in Montreal. From its inception through 2010, the series featured the broadcast team of play-by-play commentator Jon Miller and color commentator Joe Morgan. Steve Phillips joined them for the 2009 season, and Orel Hershiser did so for the 2010 season following Phillips' dismissal by the network.\nFrom 2004 until 2006, Sam Ryan served as the field reporter, but she left to join New York City's WCBS-TV and CBS Sports in June 2006. On July 2, 2006, Bonnie Bernstein joined the crew as the new field reporter, but did not return in 2007 primarily due to her request to cut back her schedule because of her continued recovery from a bout with deep vein thrombosis in October 2006. Beginning in 2006, Peter Gammons joined the broadcasts as a field reporter in the scouts position. Gammons, however, suffered a brain aneurysm and didn't return until September 2006.\nIn 2010, Miller and Morgan began their 21st consecutive season working together for ESPN. Following the 2010 season, ESPN announced that the television contracts of Miller and Morgan would not be renewed. Miller was offered, but chose to decline, a continued role with ESPN Radio.\nDan Shulman era (2011–2017).\nPlay-by-play announcer Dan Shulman joined color commentators Hershiser and Bobby Valentine as the new \"Sunday Night Baseball\" crew beginning in 2011. In an essential trade deal, following the hiring of Valentine as the Boston Red Sox manager, his predecessor Terry Francona was hired to join Shulman and Hershiser for the 2012 season. Francona stayed with ESPN for only one season before he was hired by the Cleveland Indians to be their manager for the 2013 season. Francona was replaced by John Kruk, who had been part of the \"Baseball Tonight\" team since 2004.\nLike Miller and Morgan before them, Shulman and Hershiser also formed the lead team on ESPN Radio's World Series coverage. Prior to the 2014 season, Hershiser left ESPN to become an analyst for the Dodgers on SportsNet LA, and was replaced by Curt Schilling; however, Schilling's subsequent diagnosis of and treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer led to his being unavailable to ESPN for most of the season. Shulman and Kruk worked as a two-man booth until Schilling joined them in September.\nOn August 30, 2015, former softball player Jessica Mendoza joined the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcast team as a color commentator. For the 2016 MLB season, former Yankees player Aaron Boone joined Shulman and Mendoza in the broadcast booth as the second color commentator for \"SNB\". Shulman stepped down at the conclusion of the 2017 season, while Boone left the booth after being named new Yankees manager.\nMatt Vasgersian–Alex Rodriguez era (2018–2021).\nOn January 23, 2018, ESPN announced that Alex Rodriguez and Matt Vasgersian would join Jessica Mendoza, Buster Olney, and the \"SNB\" team for the 2018 season as analyst and play-by-play respectively. For the 2020 season abbreviated due to COVID-19, Mendoza left \"SNB\" as part of her new deal with ESPN, leaving Vasgersian and Rodriguez, who broadcast all games from a studio at ESPN's Bristol, Connecticut headquarters.\nABC televised a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" matchup between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs on August 8, 2021. The broadcast marked ABC's first broadcast of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and the first regular season matchup it had broadcast since its involvement in the Baseball Network in 1995.\nRavech, Cone and Pérez (2022–present).\nIn 2021, ESPN and Major League Baseball agreed to a new contract that would last through the 2028 season. Beginning in 2022, ESPN would keep \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as its \"Game of the Week\" broadcast, but would no longer televise non-exclusive weeknight games unlike in previous years. It also gave ESPN the option to produce an alternate telecast on its sister networks (such as the popular alternate \"StatCast\" seen on ESPN2), as well as simulcasts on ESPN+.\nMatt Vasgersian left ESPN after the 2021 season to focus more on his duties for MLB Network and Bally Sports West, as he is the lead announcer for the Los Angeles Angels, which in part, due to \"SNB\", saw his role taken by Daron Sutton and Rich Waltz for most of the 2021 season. On January 7, 2022, ESPN announced that Karl Ravech would become the fourth play-by-play announcer for \"Sunday Night Baseball\", joined by analysts David Cone and Eduardo Pérez. \nOn May 14, 2023, ESPN was widely criticized for its decision to implement a split screen between its coverage of Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Playoff Western Conference semifinal series between the Vegas Golden Knights and Edmonton Oilers and a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" telecast between the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox, which was being played at the same time and was ultimately won by St. Louis by the score of 9–1.\nJon Sciambi, the lead voice for ESPN Radio's MLB coverage, will fill in for Ravech when the latter is on assignment for ESPN, most notably during the Little League World Series.\nIn 2024, it was reported that ESPN was expected to opt out of its contract with the MLB at the end of the season.\nKayRod Cast.\nStarting in 2022, alternate telecasts of eight \"Sunday Night Baseball\" games will air on ESPN2 with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez calling the games. The presentation, nicknamed \"KayRod Cast\", will be similar to the \"Monday Night Football\" \"Manningcast\" hosted by Peyton and Eli Manning.\nNotable games aired on \"Sunday Night Baseball\".\n2000s.\nOn May 28, 2000, Pedro Martínez and Roger Clemens faced off in an epic pitchers' duel at Yankee Stadium. Both pitchers threw complete games and combined for 22 strikeouts, 13 for Clemens, 9 for Martinez. The game was scoreless until Trot Nixon hit a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Martinez then got the final three outs in the bottom of the inning to secure the victory.\nESPN was on hand for the Cleveland Indians' historic comeback against the Seattle Mariners on August 5, 2001. The Indians trailed 14–2 after six innings, but scored twelve runs in the final three innings before winning in the bottom of the eleventh, 15–14. The twelve-run comeback tied the Major League record for largest deficit overcome in a game.\nOn September 2, 2001, Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees came within one strike of a perfect game against the Boston Red Sox. The effort was broken up on a single by Carl Everett, with Mussina settling for a one-hitter. The game itself was an exciting pitchers' duel, with the Red Sox' David Cone also shutting out the Yankees for eight innings, before allowing an RBI double by Enrique Wilson in the ninth. It was the only scoring of the Yankees' 1–0 win. Additionally, Cone was the most recent pitcher to record a perfect game having done so two years earlier as a Yankee against the Montreal Expos.\nOn June 16, 2002, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" covered a Subway Series at Shea Stadium in which Mo Vaughn hit a game winning three-run home run in the New York Mets' 3–2 win over the New York Yankees.\nRafael Furcal completed an unassisted triple play for the Atlanta Braves against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10, 2003. It was the 12th such play in baseball history. In the fifth inning, the shortstop caught pitcher Woody Williams' liner with the runners moving in a hit and run attempt, stepped on second base to retire catcher Mike Matheny and tagged Orlando Palmeiro before he could return to first.\nOn April 22, 2007, the Red Sox became the fifth team in Major League history to hit four consecutive home runs, doing so in the third inning of a 7–6 victory over the Yankees.\nOn April 29, 2007, a canceled broadcast occurred between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals when Cardinals relief pitcher Josh Hancock was killed in a car accident earlier in the day at 12:35 A.M. while driving under the influence. In place of the game, special programming hosted by Miller and Morgan was shown. The game was later made up on September 10, 2007, where the Cubs defeated the Cardinals 12–3, though the game was not broadcast as the Game of the Week.\nOn August 5, 2007, Tom Glavine of the New York Mets became the 23rd pitcher in history to record his 300th win. He did it in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs.\n\"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcast the Washington Nationals' very first game at Nationals Park on March 30, 2008. The Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves, 3–2, on Ryan Zimmerman's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. President George W. Bush, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the game, joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in the ESPN booth during the telecast.\nThe final game played at Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008, pitting the New York Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles, was broadcast on \"Sunday Night Baseball\".\nThe Mariano Rivera 500th career save (and also his 1st lifetime RBI) was broadcast on \"Sunday Night Baseball\" from Citi Field (home of the New York Mets).\n2010s.\nDuring the May 1, 2011, broadcast between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, ESPN announced the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, at the end of the 8th inning. At the top of the 9th inning with 1 out and Daniel Murphy at bat, fans at Citizens Bank Park erupted with U-S-A! chants despite the fact that no announcement of the news had been made in the stadium. Fans learned about the events through social media and mobile news apps. Appropriately, the Mets game against the Chicago Cubs on September 11 was a Sunday night game to mark the tenth anniversary of the attacks.\nOn July 17, 2011, a game between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays went scoreless into the 16th inning before the Red Sox scored in the top of the inning, leading to a 1–0 victory. This game was also notable for a foul ball hit by the Rays' Sean Rodriguez that hit and broke a lamp in the catwalks of Tropicana Field. As the grounds crew cleaned up the broken glass that fell onto the field, the stadium PA system played the music from \"The Natural\".\nThe Chicago Cubs and the Mets at Citi Field on September 11, 2011, was broadcast on \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as part of the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001; New York was targeted by the terrorists in the attacks of that day and the Mets hosted the first major professional sports event held in New York City since the attacks on September 21.\nOn August 30, 2015, during a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers, Jake Arrieta threw a no-hitter. This was the first no-hitter aired on \"Sunday Night Baseball\". This was the first \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game to have a female commentator in the booth, Jessica Mendoza.\nOn July 3, 2016, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" aired the Fort Bragg Game, the first professional sporting event held on an active military base, and the first MLB regular season game held in North Carolina. The Miami Marlins defeated the Atlanta Braves, 5–2.\nOn May 7, 2017, during the game between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees, they broke the MLB strikeout record as both teams combined made 48 strikeouts (Yankees 22 and Cubs 26). In addition, the 18-inning game was also the longest interleague game yet in MLB history and longest Sunday Night Baseball game yet broadcast. The Yankees won, 5–4.\nOn August 12, 2018, during a game between the Washington Nationals and the Chicago Cubs, David Bote hit a pinch-hit walk-off grand slam with his team down 3–0 and down to their final strike to give the Cubs a stunning 4–3 victory.\n2020s.\nAs previously mentioned, on August 8, 2021, the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs aired exclusively on ABC. It was the first time since 1995 that a regular season Major League Baseball game aired on ABC. White Sox won the game 9–3.\nFeatures.\nThe telecasts also utilize the \"K Zone\", a computer-generated on-screen graphic that accurately outlines the strike zone and pitch location. A Skycam is also used; it is usually mounted 20 feet above the stands in foul territory and travels back and forth along the first base line from behind home plate to the foul pole.\nCommentators.\nA complete list of broadcasters, with their period of tenure on the show (beginning years of each season shown).\nOther networks.\n\"ESPN Domingo de Grandes Ligas\" (\"Major League Sunday\") is also broadcast in Spanish on ESPN Deportes, with Ernesto Jerez on play-by-play and Luis Alfredo Alvarez as the color analyst. This version is also presented on the Spanish feed of ESPN Latin America. The Brazilian feed, in Portuguese, has Romulo Mendonça doing the play-by-play and Paulo Antunes as the analyst. They broadcast from ESPN Brasil studios in São Paulo.\nESPN Radio has aired a weekly \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcast since 1998. Currently, Jon Sciambi calls play-by-play of the games, with Chris Singleton serving as color analyst. Sciambi was preceded by Gary Thorne (2008–09), Dan Shulman (2002–07), and Charley Steiner (1998–2001), while Singleton was preceded by Dave Campbell (1999–2010) and Kevin Kennedy (1998). As of 2020, the reserves for Sciambi include Shulman and Roxy Bernstein. In Canada, this program airs on CJCL, the flagship sports radio station for Sportsnet. TUDN Radio also airs \"Sunday Night Baseball\" in Spanish, after the dissolution of ESPN Deportes Radio.\nFrom 1990 to 1997, CBS Radio aired Sunday night games, usually with Jerry Coleman and John Rooney announcing.\nOutside the US, this weekly game was also broadcast live on Five in the UK from 1997 until 2008 and at the time was the longest running programme on the channel. In Latin America the game is broadcast on ESPN Latin America. When the NFL season begins, the game is moved to ESPN Dos only for the audience in Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia and the Caribbean Islands.\nIn Canada, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" has aired on the TSN family of channels (usually on TSN2) since May 16, 2010. This was initially under a sublicensing agreement with Sportsnet, the primary Canadian rightsholder for Major League Baseball, in a deal through which TSN transferred its remaining rights to Toronto Blue Jays games to Sportsnet, which is now the exclusive carrier of Blue Jays games, and English-language rightsholder of all post-season games. Beginning in 2014, TSN has contracted directly with MLB for rights to \"SNB\" and other ESPN MLB telecasts through 2021. Sportsnet may still air individual games in the event of a scheduling conflict between all of TSN's channels. Previous carriers of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" were TSN (1990–2000), The Score (2001–2002), and Sportsnet (2003 – May 9, 2010). In French, the program is carried on Réseau des Sports with Alain Usereau and Marc Griffin working as the announcers."

        "text": "Koho is a Finnish brand of ice hockey equipment owned Birch Hill Equity Partners through its portfolio company Sport Maska Inc. Koho equipment was made originally by the company Koho-tuote Oy, which was founded in 1964 in Forssa, Finland by (1935–2003).\nSince the sale of the Koho company in 1974, the brand has gone through numerous ownership changes. Currently it is owned by the Quebec company Sport Maska, whose portfolio of brands also includes CCM, Jofa, Titan, Canadien, and Heaton.\nHistory.\nKoho-tuote was purchased in 1974 by Amer, which continued to manufacture Koho products. In 1986, Amer sold its Koho and Canadien brands to Karhu, which already owned the Titan and Jofa brands. In 1987, Karhu's hockey operations were sold to its partially-owned Canadian arm, Karhu Canada Inc., later renamed the Sports Holdings Corporation. In late 1998, the SHC was acquired by the holding company SLM International, which owned the CCM brand through its subsidiary Sport Maska. Then, in March 1999, SLM was renamed The Hockey Company, reflecting its portfolio of hockey equipment brands. In 2004, Reebok purchased The Hockey Company, then a year later, was itself purchased by Adidas. During the Reebok and Adidas ownership, all brands except CCM were phased out. In 2017, Adidas sold its hockey operations, which were still consolidated in the subsidiary Sport Maska, to the private equity firm Birch Hill Equity Partners for $110 million. Sport Maska's primary brand remains CCM, though it produces Koho-branded equipment and apparel occasionally."

        "text": "Robert Anton Grim (March 8, 1930 – October 23, 1996) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.\nCareer.\nBorn in New York City, he was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Yankees in 1948. His Major League debut was on April 18, 1954 for the Yankees. He wore uniform number 55 for the Yankees during his entire period on the team. He won 20 games (the first Yankee rookie to win 20 since 1910) and lost only 6 that year, with a 3.26 earned run average, and was voted American League Rookie of the Year, with 15 votes out of 24. He played in two World Series for the Yankees, in 1955 (against the Brooklyn Dodgers) and in 1957 (against the Milwaukee Braves). By 1957, because of arm troubles, he became an exclusive relief pitcher. He has been retroactively listed as leading the American League in saves in 1957 with 19. (At the time, saves were not a regularly calculated statistic.)\nGrim got the final out of the 1957 All-Star Game, being brought in from the bullpen with the American League leading 6–5 and getting pinch-hitter Gil Hodges on a game-ending fly out to left field. He also took the loss in Game 4 of the 1957 World Series when he allowed a walk-off home run to Milwaukee Braves third baseman Eddie Mathews.\nOn June 15, 1958, the Yankees traded Grim, along with Harry Simpson, to the Kansas City Athletics for Duke Maas and Virgil Trucks. He had records of 7–6 and 6–10 for the Athletics the next two seasons. He played with three teams in 1960. On April 5, 1960, he was traded by Kansas City to the Cleveland Indians for Leo Kiely. On May 18, the Cincinnati Reds purchased his contract from Cleveland, and on July 29, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract from Cincinnati. He spent all of 1961 at the Triple-A level in the Redbird organization.\nThe Cardinals released Grim before the 1962 season. On April 9, 1962, he was signed as a free agent with the Athletics. His final MLB game was played on May 24, and the A's released him on May 31.\nLater life.\nGrim died in Shawnee, Kansas at age 66 after suffering a heart attack while throwing snowballs with neighborhood kids."

        "text": "The Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club is a lawn tennis club in Thames Ditton, Surrey, England.\nIt was established in 1882, nine years after the official rules of lawn tennis were laid down. It is the oldest lawn tennis club still on its original site. Long after most clubs have replaced grass with various types of all-weather surface, Thames Ditton retains six outstanding grass courts and four newly installed artificial clay courts.\nLegal history.\nIn the late 1990s, as the lease of the land on which the Club plays came to an end, the survival of the TDLTC came under threat. The owner of the freehold wanted to sell the site to a residential developer. A question was raised in the House of Commons about the vulnerability of sports clubs to greedy developers: Hansard. The case entered the legal textbooks as \"Coppin v Bruce-Smith (1998) EGCS 55 (CA)\". Briefly:\nIn Coppin-Smith, the premises comprised Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club, which included ten tennis courts and a pavilion, together covering over . The tenants, the trustees of the club, served a \"s26\" request on the landlord, who served a counter-notice stating that he would resist a new lease on ground. Before the hearing, the landlord applied for planning permission for the site, which was refused on the ground of the loss of a recreational open space. The landlord then decided to demolish the buildings and courts on the basis that this would make it easier in the future to obtain planning consent.\nAt the hearing, the Court of Appeal had to consider whether the landlord had established a 'reasonable prospect' of success (using the test in \"Cadogan\"). The landlord's expert gave evidence that the proposed demolition could be carried out without planning permission. The Court of Appeal considered whether this was correct in the light of the 1995 direction that planning consent for demolition is required only for dwelling houses. It decided that, contrary to the landlord's expert's view, planning permission would be required as the works were more aptly described as engineering works than demolition works. It was agreed that the landlord would encounter the same objection as previously when applying for planning permission. Accordingly, it held that the landlord could not show the necessary firm and settled intention to demolish the premises and was unable to resist the tenant's application for a new lease.\nLocation.\nWeston Green Road, Thames Ditton, Surrey, England."

He is a switch hitter who is 6'0\" tall, weighs 195 pounds, and throws right-handed.\nCareer.\nLatham played baseball at Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada, and in 1991 the Los Angeles Dodgers selected him in the June amateur draft, taking him with the 300th overall pick as part of the draft's 11th round. Latham enjoyed a breakout season with the Yakima Bears of the Northwest League in 1994, setting a club record with a .340 batting average. Latham also made the Northwest League's All-Star team that season, establishing himself as a prospect.\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association went on strike late in 1994, and as a result major league organizations attempted to field teams of replacement players in the spring training before the 1995 season. Latham was one of the Dodgers' replacement players that spring, but the two sides reached a deal before any regular-season replacement games were played.\nOn October 30, 1995, Latham was chosen as the player to be named later in a deal that had been concluded on July 31. Los Angeles received pitchers Kevin Tapani and Mark Guthrie from the Minnesota Twins, with Latham, Ron Coomer, Greg Hansell and José Parra going the other way. Latham made his major league debut with the Twins on April 12, 1997, appearing as a pinch runner for Todd Walker in an 11-6 win over the Kansas City Royals. He spent parts of the next three seasons with the Twins, but struggled to establish himself in the major leagues, and was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Scott Randall on December 7, 1999.\nLatham spent all of the 2000 season at the AAA level, then signed with the Toronto Blue Jays organization as a minor league free agent. He enjoyed his most successful major league season with the Blue Jays in 2001, batting .274 with a .369 on-base percentage and a .425 slugging percentage in 73 at bats. After another season in AAA, he spent a brief time with the New York Yankees in 2003, then signed with Japan's Yomiuri Giants after being designated for assignment.\nLatham spent the 2005 season with the independent Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League. Most recently, he represented the United States in the 2005 World Cup of Baseball, as one of four outfielders on America's team."

        "title": "Rochester Zeniths (basketball)",
        "text": "The Rochester Zeniths were a professional basketball team in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). They played in Henrietta, New York, a suburb of Rochester at the Dome Arena and in downtown Rochester, New York, at (what is now known as) the Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial. They existed for six basketball seasons, winning two league titles and generally had great success on the basketball court before they disbanded after the 1982/83 season.\nPro-basketball in Rochester before the Zeniths.\nThe Rochester Centrals were a charter member of the original American Basketball League, the first attempt to form a major professional basketball league in the United States. The Centrals competed in the ABL from 1925 through the 1930-31 season, playing home games at the Naval Militia Armory in Rochester.\nThe Rochester Royals played in the National Basketball League and the National Basketball Association from 1945–46 through the 1956-57 season before moving to Cincinnati. They played their home games at the Edgerton Park Sports Arena and later the Rochester War Memorial in the city of Rochester. They enjoyed success at the turnstiles and on the basketball court, winning the NBA title in 1951 and finishing as runner-up in the NBL in 1947 and 1948. Their move to Cincinnati in the summer of 1957 was part of the general franchise relocation process of the 1950s and 1960s in the NBA which saw these older smaller markets abandoned in favor of larger markets with larger arenas.\nIn the summer of 1958, a group of Buffalo businessmen announced that they were creating a team called the Rochester Colonels to begin play in the fall of that year in the Pennsylvania-based Eastern Professional Basketball League. The team was intended to fill the void created when the Royals left town. Former Rochester Royals great Arnie Risen was recruited to join and coach the team to pique fan interest. The Colonels also featured former Royal Dick Ricketts and future Hall of Famer Hubie Brown. It was all for naught as the team went 0-8 and folded in December 1958, playing just two home games before modest crowds at the Rochester Community War Memorial.\nBeginning in the 1959–60 season, the Syracuse Nationals of the NBA began playing regular season games in Rochester. During the 1959–60 and the 1960-61 seasons they played two games in Rochester and during the 1961–62 and 1962-63 seasons they played four games in Rochester (as well as playing a number of games in Utica, New York, during the same period). These \"neutral site\" games were common during this period of the NBA (for instance, Wilt Chamberlain's historic 100 point performance occurred in Hershey, Pennsylvania, then a semi-regular site for NBA games) but they were not particularly well attended and definitely not popular with the players and coaches as they added more travel to the schedule. The Syracuse Nationals became the Philadelphia 76ers after the 1962–63 season ended (when the Philadelphia Warriors moved to San Francisco) and regular season NBA games ended in Rochester as well.\nDuring the 1970–71 season the expansion Buffalo Braves of the NBA played two regular season games in Rochester (as well as two in Syracuse) in an effort to build Western New York interest in the nascent franchise. The Braves were not a very good team and the games were not as successful at the gate as the team hoped and the Braves did not return the next season. The Braves were bucking the south and west trend of NBA franchise movement and the hope was their large market, large arena and fan interest in nearby NBA abandoned cities (they played fifteen games in Toronto during the 1973–74 and 1974-75 season in an effort to regionalize into Canada) would be enough to make the team successful. The Braves played their last game in Buffalo as the Braves in April 1978 and the club moved to Southern California to become the San Diego (and later, Los Angeles) Clippers. Not many fans frequently made the 70-mile trip from Rochester to Buffalo to see the Braves play as, for the most part, they were not a competitive team.\nThe move of the Braves out of Buffalo coincided with rise of another professional, albeit minor league team in Rochester known as the Zeniths.\nHistory.\nThe Rochester Zeniths were organized in the fall of 1977 to play professional basketball in the newly formed All-American Basketball Alliance by Tom Ficara, originator of the league. They were owned by Dick Hill who owned Hill TV, a Rochester electronics store that sold Zenith brand televisions, hence the nickname Zeniths Hill also initially owned the Rochester Zeniths professional softball team that played in two different men's professional softball leagues in the Rochester area starting in 1978. The softball team changed its name in 1980 to the Rochester Express after Hill sold the team. The Zeniths basketball team began play in January 1978 along with the rest of the All-American Alliance, but the league folded within a month. The Zeniths played 11 games and finished with a 10-1 record. Attendance at home games at the War Memorial was by far the best in the league.\nFor the 1978–79 basketball season, the Zeniths joined the newly renamed Continental Basketball Association (formerly the Eastern Basketball League) and played most of their home games at the Dome Arena at the Monroe County Fairgrounds in Henrietta, New York. The Dome Arena was built primarily as an exposition hall for the annual county fair, as well as business shows and conventions. It was not particularly well suited for basketball; for one thing, it did not have a hardwood floor. Instead, the Dome bought a green basketball carpet from a Swedish firm and used that for Zeniths games. While not popular with players or fans, the carpet met with the league's approval, despite the odd muffled sound made every time a player dribbled the ball. (The War Memorial had a standard hardwood basketball floor.)\nThe Zeniths were coached by local product Mauro Panaggio, a successful Division III basketball coach at SUNY Brockport, and featured many former prominent Western New York college basketball players, most notably guard Glenn Hagan from St. Bonaventure and forward Larry Fogle from Canisius College (both had been second-round NBA Draft picks). The team played a very fast, uptempo style that was the prevailing trend in the CBA at the time. They were the dominant team in the league that year, finishing 36-12 and winning the Northern Division title by nine and a half games over the Anchorage Northern Knights. In the playoffs, they lost only once, beating the Allentown Jets three games to one and then sweeping the Knights in the finals. Star guard Andre McCarter was named both Newcomer of the Year and Most Valuable Player for the season. Panaggio was named league Coach of the Year.\nAlso of note was the Zeniths' hosting of the 1979 CBA All-Star game at the Dome Arena, as Rochester took on a team of all-stars from the rest of the league. When a blizzard knocked out electric power in the city and the arena just after the first half ended, an impromptu slam dunk competition (won by Billy Ray Bates of the Maine Lumberjacks) was conducted using the building's emergency lighting. Power was not restored and fans were sent home. The next night, however, the game resumed, and rather than just play the remaining two quarters, league commissioner Jim Drucker decided to play another \"four\" quarters – making the six-quarter, 72-minute game the longest contest in pro basketball history. McCarter was named the game's Most Valuable Player as the Z's won, 182-168, in front of announced crowd of 1,724.\nThe Zeniths were again the top team in the CBA in 1979-80 but only won the division over Anchorage by a game and a half, then lost a hard-fought finals rematch with the Knights in seven games./ For this season, the Zeniths were coached by co-owner and nightclub proprietor Art Stock, who bought a stake in the team after his Jersey Shore Bullets folded the previous season. Mauro Panaggio moved to the front office as General Manager, but resumed his duties as head coach for the 1980-81 season until the demise of the team in 1983.\nThe 1980-81 campaign was the high water mark for the Zeniths franchise as they ran away with the Eastern Division title at 34-6 and once again took the league title while only losing one game in the playoffs, sweeping the Lehigh Valley Jets in two straight, beating Philadelphia two games to one and sweeping the Montana Golden Nuggets coached by George Karl in four straight games.\nIn their final two season in Rochester, the Zeniths had back-to-back winning seasons but lost was bounced in the first round of the playoffs each year. By this time, all games had been moved to the War Memorial, but attendance was on the decline. Faced with mounting financial losses, the team disbanded following the 1982-83 season. Panaggio went on to continue his success in the CBA, and retired as the winningest coach in league history. He died in 2018.\nLegacy.\nMauro Panaggio's son, Dan Panaggio went into coaching and served as the head coach of the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League after following in his father's footsteps and coaching the Quad City Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association to two league titles in 1994 and 1998.\nAfter many false starts, professional basketball returned to Rochester in the form of an American Basketball Association (21st century) franchise known as the Rochester RazorSharks. The RazorSharks began play in the ABA in November 2005, and won the ABA Championship in their inaugural season. In 2008, the team left the ABA to become a charter member of the Premier Basketball League. The Razorsharks won the first PBL Championship."

        "text": "The Puerto Rico national baseball team (), also known as Team Rubio is the national baseball team of Puerto Rico. The men's senior team is currently ranked 13th in the world. Puerto Rico is the incumbent Pan American and Central American/Caribbean champion, as well as the 2017 World Baseball Classic runner-up. The team will compete against Israel, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Nicaragua in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in March 2023 in Miami, Florida. \nAfter debuting in the amateur predecessor to the Baseball World Cup, the team won its first medal by finishing second in 1947, a performance that it repeated the following year. In 1951, Puerto Rico became the world baseball champion by winning the event. The team went on to gather six more medals during the tournament's existence, finishing second twice and third four times.\nPuerto Rico was an inaugural member of the World Baseball Classic, making its debut in the first edition. The team has advanced to the second round in all of its appearances, in the process becoming the first team to score mercy rule wins over Cuba and the United States. In the 2013 World Baseball Classic, Puerto Rico became the second team from the Western Hemisphere to advance to the final, eliminating two-time defending world champion Japan in the semifinals before finishing as the event's runner-up. The team has also participated in several other international competitions, such as the Central American and Caribbean Games, the Pan American Games, Americas Baseball Cup, Intercontinental Cup, and Haarlem Baseball Week, winning medals in most.\nBaseball World Cup era.\nEarly years of amateur baseball.\nPuerto Rico made its debut at the Baseball World Cup, then known as the \"Amateur World Series\" in 1940, only two years after the creation of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente (LBPPR), which at the moment was an amateur league. Like all of the other expansion teams, they finished in the bottom half of the table, tied with Mexico with a record of 2–10. The following year the team repeated this performance, finishing tied with El Salvador. Between 1942 and 1943, Puerto Rico did not participate due to the ongoing World War II to which several LBPPR players were drafted. The team returned in 1944, but finished tied with Nicaragua with a record of 1–6. Puerto Rico declined participation in the 1945 Amateur World Series, joining Mexico and Cuba in absence.\nWorld Championship.\nAs the LBPPR expanded and became more organized, the quality of players composing the Puerto Rican national team improved. Returning in 1947, Puerto Rico won the silver medal, having entered the round robin tied with a record of 6–2, defeating Nicaragua to advance before losing to the host, Colombia, in the finals. Puerto Rico went 6–1 in the round-robin but lost 11–1 and 2–1 to the Dominicans in the best-of-3 finals. They won their second straight Silver Medal. M. Ruiz tied for the most doubles (4) and most triples (2). In 1950, the team finished the regular phase of the tournament tied with the Dominican Republic and Cuba for the first place with a record of 9–2, the team defeated Cuba and lost to the Dominican Republic during the round robin phase. However, the Federación Internacional de Béisbol Aficionado (FIBA) ruled that several players that had joined the team were ineligible to play, ruling several key victories \"forfeits\" and dropping it out of the podium. This incident was the result of the LBPPR from amateur to professional a few years earlier.\nIn 1951, Puerto Rico earned a record of 7–3 in the regular stage, handing Cuba its only defeat in the first games. After advancing, the team went undefeated with wins over Cuba and Venezuela to secure the gold medal. The team was headlined by Sotero Ortiz who scored more runs (21) and stole more bases (10) than anyone else, while teammate Ramon Maldonado hit 8 doubles to lead the statistic. In 1952, Puerto Rico went 7–3, including 2–2 in the final round to take bronze medal. They were the only team to beat Cuba in the finals. W. Figueredo led in triples (3) while J.R. Garcia led in homers (2) and steals (7). Sotero Ortiz tied for the most doubles (4) and runs (13). Due to the improving quality of its players, Puerto Rico soon began experiencing the loss of its best players to the professional leagues at a very young age, including Roberto Clemente and Orlando Cepeda. In 1953, the team finished 6th with a record of 5–5. However, Félix Torres drove in 15 runs to lead the Series.\nBy the time that the series resumed in 1963, Major League Baseball had become the primary employer of Puerto Rican talent, making them ineligible to play in the Amateur World Series and the team did not participate in this edition. Back for the tournament in 1965, Puerto Rico won Bronze with a 5–3 record. Andres Cruz led the Series in average (.485), hits (16) and RBI (8). Pitcher Efrain Contreras set an Amateur World Series record by striking out 19 against the Netherlands Antilles. After another hiatus of four years, the event resumed in 1969, which saw Panama, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Nicaragua all tied for 5th with 4–6 records. Luis Mercado led the tournament in doubles (6) and tied for the most triples (3). In 1970, Puerto Rico won the bronze medal with a record of 9–2. Ramón Ortiz hit the most home runs (3) in the competition.\nFIBA vs. FEMBA; unique dual medallist.\nIn 1971, Puerto Rico finished tied with Nicaragua in the third place with a record of 6–3, but did not receive the bronze medal due to their individual series. Carlos Lowell led all pitchers with 3 wins. In 1972, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Chinese Taipei tied for 6th, all with 9–6 marks. The team was managed by Roberto Clemente (only weeks prior to his death) and featured a no-hitter by Sandalio Quinonez against Costa Rica. In 1973, Puerto Rico participated in two versions of the Amateur World Series due to internal conflicts in the sport, in the Federación Internacional de Béisbol Aficionado version, the team won the silver medal with a record of 10–3, with two of those loses coming at the hands of eventual winner, Cuba. J. Fontanez led in average (.432). The team was managed by Vic Power. A splinter cell of the national team won the bronze at the event's Federación Mundial de Béisbol Amateur version with a record of 8–2. Puerto Rico is the only participant to win medals in both of the 1973 events. Eventually the FIBA and FEMBA merged and the event had only one sanctioning body, the International Amateur Baseball Association (IABF). In 1974, Puerto Rico finished tied for fourth place at the Amateur World Series along Canada, Italy, Chinese Taipei and the Dominican Republic. In the 1976 World Amateur Series, Puerto Rico won Silver with an 8–2 round-robin before leaving the tournament prior to the final round. J.L. de Leon led the tournament with a 0.00 ERA. After missing the 1978 edition of the World Amateur Series, the team came back in 1980, but finished tied in the 7th place with Venezuela with a 4–7 record. After missing out another version of the Amateur World Series, the team returned in 1984, finishing behind Panama with a record of 6–7, despite gathering a 54–46 advantage in runs. Mariano Quinones (2–0, 2.48) was their most effective pitcher. The top hitter was 1B Luis Fontanez (.353/.400/.569). Future MLB player Hector Villanueva was part of the roster, but had an unsuccessful tournament going 2 for 13 with a double and no walks. In the 1986 Amateur World Series, Puerto Rico tied for 7th at 5–6, despite outscoring opponents 56–45. Roberto Santana (.369) led the Series with 6 stolen bases. Eddie Rodriguez (1.28) had two saves. By 1988, the Amateur World Series became known as the Baseball World Cup and Puerto Rico beat both No. 3 Taiwan and No. 4 Japan and lost to No. 1 Cuba by just one run. However, losses to Canada, Nicaragua and South Korea kept the team out of the final four. CF Ángel Morales (.395/.490/.737, 14 R, 14 RBI) and DH Helson Rodriguez (.300/.462/.650) guided the offensive charge. Victor L. Martinez was 0–1 with a 1.80 ERA, the lowest on the staff.\nMigration of MLB All-Stars and fallout.\nBeginning during the last years of the 1980s and extending throughout the 1990s, Puerto Rico saw a major increase in its production of high-caliber players, with a crop that included Iván Rodríguez, Roberto Alomar, Bernie Williams, Rubén Sierra, Jorge Posada, Juan González, Carlos Delgado, Edgar Martínez and Carlos Beltrán among several others. This fact severely limited the quantity of talent available for the national baseball team, due to the protective behavior exhibited by the MLB teams that signed these players since their teenage years. In the 1990 Baseball World Cup, Puerto Rico went 7–2 but finished 4th thanks to the format. They were 4th with 52 runs and second in ERA (2.89). 1B Efrain Garcia (.351/.385/.568, 7 RBI), All-Star CF Ángel Morales (.417/.463/.556, 8 R, 10 RBI) and DH Helson Rodriguez (.371/.385/.714, 3 HR, 11 RBI) paced the offense. Headlining a fine staff was Jesus I. Feliciano (1–0, 0.56). In 1994, Puerto Rico finished with a 3–4 record, with two close one-run losses (3–2 to Panama and 4–3 to the Netherlands). They hit .305 as a team, fifth in that tournament. Top performers were 1B Efrain Garcia (.448/.484/.724, 8 RBI in 7 games), C Jose Lorenzana (.400/.455/.500), RF Joel Perez (.318/.348/.682) and P Nelson Sanchez (1–1, 2.25). After being absent from two World Cups, the team returned in 2005 but Puerto Rico Puerto Rico, managed by Bert Peña, went 6–5 despite being outscored overall, 60–56. They finished 8th overall. Randy Ruiz (.346/.452/.654), CF Jesus Feliciano (.378/.410/.649, 10 R, 9 RBI) and Edwards Guzman (.343/.375/.543) led the offense However, former MLB player Angel Echevarria had a weak performance with averages of .083/.241/.125. Orlando Román (2–0, 0.50) was their clear top starter as 4 pitchers had ERAs over 8.\nPuerto Rico debuted in the inaugural World Baseball Classic by hosting Pool C on March 7, 2006, and defeating Panama with a score of 2–1. The team followed this by winning their second game over the Netherlands, 8–3. Puerto Rico closed the first round by winning Pool C with a 12–2 mercy rule victory over the defending world champion, Cuba. The team opened the second round by defeating the Dominican Republic 7–1. However, the team lost its next game to Venezuela 6–0. Puerto Rico was eliminated with a 4–3 loss in a rematch with Cuba.\n2008–2011.\nPuerto Rico began this Olympic cycle participating in the 2008 America Baseball Cup. The team debuted on September 26, 2008, defeating Mexico 2:1, this game was won by Josué Matos. Puerto Rico concluded the tournament's first round undefeated, with victories over Brazil (6:3), Aruba (7:0) and Guatemala (8:0). In the first two games, Andy González scored four doubles and Carlos Rivera hit his second home run of the round. In the game against Aruba, Orlando Román threw a perfect game over seven innings. In the second round, Puerto Rico defeated Panama (9:4) to qualify for the 2009 Baseball World Cup. On the second date, the team lost their only game of the tournament to Venezuela (5:4). In the next game, the team defeated Netherlands Antilles by ten runs (14:4). Puerto Rico won the 2008 Americas Baseball Cup on October 5, 2008, defeating Nicaragua in the final.\nPuerto Rico hosted Pool D of the 2009 World Baseball Classic, debuting with a 7–0 victory over Panama. In its second game, the team defeated the Netherlands 3–1. Both teams met in an immediate rematch to determine the group winner, which Puerto Rico won with scores of 5–0. The team opened the second round by giving the United States its first mercy rule loss, 11–1. Puerto Rico next played Venezuela, losing 2–0. Facing the United States in an elimination game, Puerto Rico lost 6–5 after losing the lead during the final inning. Iván Rodríguez was selected the All-WBC team catcher.\nFor the Baseball World Cup, Puerto Rico, once again led by Eduardo Pérez, created a roster composed of mostly professional players, including several Major League Baseball athletes. The final cut included infielders Alex Cintrón, Rubén Gotay, Melvin Falú, Carlos Rivera and Angel Sánchez; catchers Orlando Mercado, Jr., Stephen Morales and Raúl Casanova; pitchers Luis Atilano, Mario Santiago, José Santiago, Orlando Román, Juan Padilla, Angel García, Richard Rodríguez, Miguel Mejía, Alexander Woodson, Nelvin Fuentes, Melvin Pizarro and Efraín Nieves as well as outfielders Miguel Negrón, Luis Matos y Miguel Abreu. José Valentín was selected to perform as both infielder and outfielder. Javier Valentín and Juan González were evaluated, but excluded from the final cut due to previous injuries. The fact that most of the roster was professional received some criticism from the amateur circuit. Journalist Duldin Meléndez of \"Periodico La Cordillera\" wrote in a piece that \"[Pérez] is not familiar with the [amateur] players and has not even seen them play\" expressing a similar concern about the Federation's president, Israel Roldán. Juan Carlos Díaz, infielder of the Bravos de Cidra in Béisbol AA, openly expressed disappointment when he did not receive an invitation, noting that he deserved it after leading the Liga Caribe division with an average of .632 and the league's final in offensive. Making its debut on September 10, 2009, Puerto Rico's first opponent is Cuba.\nFor the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games, the number of players per roster was limited to 20. Consequently, players such as Juan González and José Valentín were not included in the final cut. Carlos Delgado was included in the preliminary list, but was unable to compete due to injury. The team was mostly composed of professional players such as Víctor Raúl González, Orlando Mercado, Jorge Jiménez, Philip Cuadrado, Adrián Ortiz, Efraín Nieves, Ricard Rodríguez Nick Ortiz, Armando Ríos, Christopher Amador, Edwards Guzmán and Mario Santiago, but also included three amateurs, Antonio Acevedo, Joycet Feliciano and Manuel Romero. Amateur pitcher Jean Ortega was a last minute addition due to an injury suffered by Acevedo. Puerto Rico debuted with a victory over Guatemala in seven innings. The following night the team recorded its second victory, 3:2, over Venezuela, in a game that extended to one extra inning. Efraín Nieves debuted with a shutout victory over Panama, allowing only one hit. Puerto Rico was the leader in its group, closing the first round with a 6:0 victory over the United States Virgin Islands. However, the team lost a 0–1 game to Mexico in the semifinals and the bronze medal to Nicaragua 6–7.\nFor the 2010 Americas Baseball Cup, Eduardo Pérez assembled an entirely different roster. Several players from the Minor Leagues who were unable to compete at the Central American and Caribbean Games, because this event was not sanctioned by the IBAF, now joined the pre-selection. Only few players, such as Irving Falú were kept from the CAC team. The most notable addition was González, who was joined by Fernando Cabrera, Kiko Calero, Federico Báez, Saúl Rivera, Ramón Vázquez, Gabriel Martinez, Luis Figueroa, Jorge Padilla, Alex Cora and Christian Colón. Puerto Rico was drafted to Group A, along Argentina, Aruba, Canada, Panama and the Dominican Republic.\nGenerational shift (2013–2016).\nAfter 2011, the IBAF decided to phase out the Baseball World Cup, with the WBC replacing it as the premier competition in international baseball. During this time frame the team was immersed in a change of the guard, losing MLB All-Stars Iván Rodríguez, Carlos Delgado and Bernie Williams to retirement. As with the previous editions, Puerto Rico hosted the first round of the 2013 Classic. However, this time the team faced different adversaries following an expansion, defeating Spain 3–0 in its debut. Puerto Rico secured classification to the second round by winning a game over Venezuela, 6–3. The team closed the round by losing the seeding game to the Dominican Republic, 4–2. Puerto Rico opened the second round with a 7–1 loss to the United States. The team remained alive by defeating Italy 4–3. In its second consecutive elimination game, Puerto Rico defeated the United States 4–3. Facing the Dominican Republic in another seeding game, the team lost 2–0. Puerto Rico advanced by defeating the defending WBC champion, Japan, with scores of 3–1. In the event finals, the team lost a third contest to the Dominican Republic, 3–0, to finish their participation as the tournament's runner up. Yadier Molina was the All-WBC catcher, while Ángel Pagán and Nelson Figueroa received positions among the outfielders and pitchers.\nThe date of the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games has opened the door for Puerto Rico and several other teams to reinforce themselves with MLB players, raising the competitive level of what is usually a low caliber tournament. The team finished fourth.\nRegional championships (2017–2021).\nPuerto Rico repeated their previous WBC performance in 2017, finishing as the tournament's runner-up.\nFor secondary competitions, former MLB player Juan González was named as manager making his debut at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games. Unable to request athletes contracted to MLB (or active in MiLB), he assembled a team composed by players active in foreign independent leagues, the local Doble A amateur league and veteran free agents with previous professional experience, making the final cut following a preparatory tournament. González made his official debut as manager in a 5:3 victory over Venezuela. In its next outing, Puerto Rico defeated Cuba 8:1 to snap a 36-year (43-game) winning streak at the CACG. This was followed by wins over the Dominican Republic (4:1) and Mexico (7:1). On July 26, 2018, Puerto Rico defeated second-place Colombia 2:1 to clinch the first place of the round robin. This was followed by inconsequential losses to Panama (2:5) and Guatemala (9:10). González closed his first participation as manager by leading Puerto Rico to the Central American and Caribbean gold medal.\nOnce again managed by González, Puerto Rico won the gold medal of the 2019 Pan American Games, going undefeated and besting Canada 6:1 in the final. The team tried but failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics at the eight-team Americas Qualifying Event on May 31 through June 5, 2021.\nAbridged Olympic circle (2022–2024).\nDespite being the defending CACG champion, Puerto Rico had to play in the Caribbean Baseball Cup to qualify for the 2023 tournament. Facing issues with the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente due to itinerary conflicts, González was able to assemble a team composed by players from the local Béisbol Superior Doble A amateur league, beginning the participation with a 7:1 loss to defending champion Curaçao. Puerto Rico then won consecutive shut out games over Cuba (6:0) and the United States Virgin Islands (6:0). The team advanced in the first place of the global standings by defeating the Bahamas with scores of 14:2. It won a rematch (9:3) in the semifinals to contend for the title and qualify for the CACG.

The team is controlled by the Royal Netherlands Baseball and Softball Federation, which is represented in the WBSC Europe.\nThe team is made up primarily of players from the Netherlands in Europe, and from Dutch territories and islands in the Caribbean that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, such as Aruba and Curaçao (which is part of the former Netherlands Antilles, which have since been dissolved), where baseball is extremely popular. Some foreigners of Dutch descent have also been members of the team. While baseball only maintains a niche following throughout Europe, the Netherlands, along with Italy, are the two European countries where the sport's popularity is strongest; the team has finished in either first or second place in 31 out of the 32 European Baseball Championships in which it has appeared, the exception being the 2023 European Baseball Championship, where it finished in third place.\nThe team played in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, and finished in 4th place. It won the 2019 European Baseball Championship, winning a gold medal. It then competed at the Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament, in Italy in September 2019, taking second place behind Team Israel. The team tried but failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics at the three-team Final Qualifying Tournament in late June 2021.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nThe Netherlands has competed in all five of the World Baseball Classic tournaments held. All 16 teams that played in the 2006 edition were invited to compete in the second in 2009. The team was an automatic qualifier for the 2013 and 2017 tournaments.\nThe Netherlands has progressed to the second round of competition in 2009, and achieved its highest finish, 4th, in both the 2013 and 2017 tournaments. Unusual for international competition in baseball, the squads selected in the World Baseball Classic tournaments featured players active in Major League Baseball in addition to Minor League, Nippon Professional Baseball, and local players. Generally players in the Major Leagues are unavailable due to their contracts with the respective clubs.\nThe Netherlands team in the World Baseball Classic has featured several Major Leaguers: Andruw Jones, Sidney Ponson, Randall Simon, Roger Bernadina, Shairon Martis, Jonathan Schoop, Xander Bogaerts, Andrelton Simmons, Didi Gregorius, Jurickson Profar, and Kenley Jansen, most born in the Caribbean in either Aruba or Curaçao.\n2006.\nPrior to the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the Netherlands played four exhibition games. They lost two games, against a college team from the University of Tampa and an Atlanta Braves squad, at Cracker Jack Stadium in Kissimmee, Florida.\nThe Netherlands competed in Pool C—along with world champion Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico—in the first round at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nHaving failed to win against Cuba and Puerto Rico in their round-robin pool games, they finished third in their pool, and were eliminated along with Panama.\n2009.\nPrior to the 2009 World Baseball Classic, the Netherlands played seven exhibition games, including three games against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Minnesota Twins. The Netherlands team lost all three games against these MLB opponents.\nThe Netherlands competed in Pool D, along with 2006 WBC semi-finalist Dominican Republic, Panama, and Puerto Rico, in the first round at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The team won both games against the strong Dominican Republic team. As result, the team made it through the first double-elimination round along with Puerto Rico.\nIn the second round the Dutch lost both their games against Venezuela and the United States. Therefore, the team was eliminated and finished 7th in the final standings.\n2013.\nThe Netherlands competed in Pool B against Chinese Taipei, South Korea, and Australia at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taichung, Taiwan. The Dutch team won their first game against South Korea 5–0, but lost to the Chinese Taipei 8–3. However, the Netherlands won against Australia 4–1, thus securing their position for Round 1 in Tokyo Dome to face off against Japan and Cuba.\nThe Dutch team defeated the Cuban team 6–2 before facing two-time defending champion Japan and earned a humiliating loss 16–4 at the end of 7th inning due to mercy rule and faced off against Cuba once again. They narrowly clinched their win against the Cuban team 7–6 to secure their position in the semi-finals where they lost against the Japanese team again 10–6. They faced off against the Dominican Republic where they lost 4–1. The Netherlands finished 4th overall.\n2017.\nTeam Netherlands, ranked 9th in the world, included major league stars, many of whom were raised in islands in the Caribbean that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The players included All Star shortstop Xander Bogaerts (Boston Red Sox; from Aruba), 20-home-run-hitter shortstop Didi Gregorius (New York Yankees; raised in Curaçao, which is part of the former Netherlands Antilles which have since been dissolved), 20-home-run-hitter second baseman Jonathan Schoop (Baltimore Orioles; born in Curaçao), Gold-Glover shortstop Andrelton Simmons (Los Angeles Angels; born in Curaçao), and infielder/outfielder Jurickson Profar (Texas Rangers; born in Curaçao). \"Sports Illustrated\" opined that the Dutch team \"boasts arguably the most talented infield in the entire tournament.\"\nThe Netherlands was defeated by Team Israel (4–2). It then beat South Korea (5–0) and Taiwan (6–5), in the first round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Along with Israel, which came in ahead of it in the pool, it qualified for the next round, in Japan.\nIn what NBC reported was thought to be the tallest batter-pitcher matchup in baseball history, the Dutch team's pitcher Loek van Mil walked Israel's first baseman Nate Freiman.\nIn the second round an extra innings loss against Japan was followed by two mercy rule wins against Israel and Cuba. Together with Japan which had finished top of the pool the Netherlands advanced to the championship round. 2016 All Star and NL Reliever of the Year Kenley Jansen joined the Dutch team for the championship round.\nThe Netherlands semifinal match against Puerto Rico ended with an 11th inning walk-off sac fly by Eddie Rosario. The final score was 3–4. Dutch outfielder Wladimir Balentien was chosen in the All-WBC team.\nOlympics.\nThe Dutch best finish in an Olympics is fifth place, which they did in both 1996 &amp; 2000. The first time the Netherlands participated in the baseball tournament at the Summer Olympics was in . Netherlands finished with a 1–2 record, with its only victory coming against Chinese Taipei. There was no official placing as Baseball at the 1988 Summer Olympics was a demonstration sport.\nIt competed at the Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament, in Italy in September 2019, taking second place behind Israel.\nBaseball World Cup.\nTheir best finish in the International Baseball Federation's (IBAF) World Cup was first place, which they achieved in . Netherlands also hosted the games twice, in and in . In , the Netherlands was one of the 8 European nations to host the 2009 Baseball World Cup. It marked the first time in history that the World Cup was not hosted by a specific country, but rather by a whole continent.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\nTeam Netherlands won the 2019 European Baseball Championship, winning a gold medal. Among the players competing for it were Roger Bernadina, Mike Bolsenbroek, Donny Breek, Rob Cordemans, Tom de Blok, Yurendell DeCaster, Lars Huijer, Kevin Kelly, Dwayne Kemp, Diego Markwell, Randolph Oduber, Dashenko Ricardo, Shairon Martis, Kalian Sams, Sharlon Schoop, Curt Smith, Tom Stuifbergen, JC Sulbaran, and Orlando Yntema.\nEuropean Baseball Championship\nOther tournament results.\nIntercontinental Cup\nHaarlemse Honkbalweek\nWorld Port Tournament\nWorld Junior Baseball Championship\nEuropean Junior Baseball Championship"

        "title": "Panama national baseball team",
        "text": " \nThe Panama national baseball team (Spanish: \"Selección de béisbol de Panamá\") is the baseball team that represents Panama at an international level. Along with Nicaragua, they are considered to be the best baseball team in Central America, and one of the best in Latin America. Panama has medalled at multiple international tournaments at both junior and senior levels throughout the sport's history, including one silver medal and two bronze medals at the Baseball World Cup. They are currently the 14th ranked baseball team in the world.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nInternational Tournaments.\n2006.\nPanama was placed in Pool C of the inaugural World Baseball Classic, playing at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Puerto Rico. In their opening game, they fell to hosts, 2-1, before losing to Cuba, 8-6, in extra innings. They concluded play with a 10-0, 7-inning loss to Netherlands, failing to get a hit off Dutch pitcher Shairon Martis.\n2009.\nPanama once again was sent to Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, this time as part of the double-elimination Pool D. They opened their campaign with a 7-0 defeat to Puerto Rico, setting up an elimination game against the Dominican Republic, which they lost 9-0. Having failed to score a single run, Panama finished in 15th place overall, just ahead of South Africa.\n2013.\nAfter finishing last in their pool for the 2009 Classic, Panama was forced to qualify for the 2013 edition. They were selected as the host for Qualifier 3 and were favored to qualify. However, they were upset by Brazil, 3-2, in their opener. After defeating Nicaragua and Colombia in elimination matches, they faced off with Brazil again. Despite having multiple Major League Baseball players to Brazil's one, Panama fell again, 1-0, and missed the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\n2017.\nPanama was again forced to qualify for the 2017 edition. They were selected as the host for Qualifier 3. After defeating France in their opener they fell to Colombia. After defeating France again, they set up a rematch with Colombia but lost the elimination game after Colombia's Dilson Herrera hit a late homer.\nHistory.\nTowns including Colón and Panama City in the Canal Zone had one or more clubs in which British West Indian middling classes played cricket. Cricket became a prime symbol of what Afro-Caribbeans knew made them “Britishers.” As decolonization progressed, the popularity of baseball increased in Panama. The similarity in skills required for cricket and baseball meant that an athlete who primarily practiced one sport could also excel in the other. Oscar Levy was a baseball player who had left Panama in 1920 for the United States. In 1928 the \"Panama Tribune\" reported on the success of “famous local pitcher” Chick Levy as a “hero in Cuba.”"

        "title": "Professional boxing",
        "text": "Professional boxing, or prizefighting, is regulated, sanctioned boxing. Professional boxing bouts are fought for a purse that is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional fights are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referees.\nIn contrast with amateur boxing, professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds, though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds. Protective headgear is not permitted, and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted. Professional boxing has enjoyed a much higher profile than amateur boxing throughout the 20th century and beyond.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1891, the National Sporting Club (N.S.C.), a private club in London, began to promote professional glove fights at its own premises, and created nine of its own rules to augment the Queensberry Rules. These rules specified more accurately, the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of a fight. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) was first formed in 1919 with close links to the N.S.C., and was re-formed in 1929 after the N.S.C. closed.\nIn 1909, the first of twenty-two belts were presented by the fifth Earl of Lonsdale to the winner of a British title fight held at the N.S.C. In 1929, the BBBofC continued to award Lonsdale Belts to any British boxer who won three title fights in the same weight division. The \"title fight\" has always been the focal point in professional boxing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, there were title fights at each weight. Promoters who could stage profitable title fights became influential in the sport, as did boxers' managers. The best promoters and managers have been instrumental in bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking media and public interest. The most famous of all three-way partnership (fighter-manager-promoter) was that of Jack Dempsey (heavyweight champion 1919–1926), his manager Jack Kearns, and the promoter Tex Rickard. Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a \"golden age\" of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s. They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title fight (Dempsey v. Georges Carpentier, in 1921). In the United Kingdom, Jack Solomons' success as a fight promoter helped re-establish professional boxing after the Second World War and made the UK a popular place for title fights in the 1950s and 1960s.\nModern history.\n1900 to 1920.\nIn the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain, and champions were recognised by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day. Among the great champions of the era were the peerless heavyweight Jim Jeffries and Bob Fitzsimmons, who weighed more than 190 pounds (86 kilograms), but won world titles at middleweight (1892), light heavyweight (1903), and heavyweight (1897). Other famous champions included light heavyweight Philadelphia Jack O'Brien and middleweight Tommy Ryan. After winning the Bantamweight title in 1892, Canada's George Dixon became the first ever black athlete to win a World Championship in any sport; he was also the first Canadian-born boxing champion. On May 12, 1902, lightweight Joe Gans became the first black American to be boxing champion. Despite the public's enthusiasm, this was an era of far-reaching regulation of the sport, often with the stated goal of outright prohibition. In 1900, the State of New York enacted the Lewis Law, banned prizefights except for those held in private athletic clubs between members. Thus, when introducing the fighters, the announcer frequently added the phrase \"Both members of this club\", as George Wesley Bellows titled one of his paintings. The western region of the United States tended to be more tolerant of prizefights in this era, although the private club arrangement was standard practice here as well, San Francisco's California Athletic Club being a prominent example.\nOn December 26, 1908, heavyweight Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion and a highly controversial figure in that racially charged era. Prizefights often had unlimited rounds, and could easily become endurance tests, favouring patient tacticians like Johnson. At lighter weights, ten round fights were common, and lightweight Benny Leonard dominated his division from the late teens into the early twenties.\nChampionship level prizefighters in this period were the premier sports celebrities, and a title bout generated intense public interest. Long before bars became popular venues in which to watch sporting events on television, enterprising saloon keepers were known to set up ticker machines and announce the progress of an important bout, blow by blow. Local kids often hung about outside the saloon doors, hoping for news of the fight. Harpo Marx, then fifteen, recounted vicariously experiencing the 1904 Jeffries-Munroe championship fight in this way.\nLength of bouts.\nProfessional bouts are limited to a maximum of twelve rounds, where each round last 3 minutes for men, 2 minutes for women. Most are fought over four to ten rounds depending upon the experience of the boxers. Through the early twentieth century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit or the fight was stopped by police. In the 1910s and 1920s, a fifteen-round limit gradually became the norm, benefiting high-energy fighters like Jack Dempsey.\nFor decades, boxing matches went on for 15 rounds, but that was all changed on November 13, 1982, following the death of Korean boxer Kim Duk-koo in a fight against Ray Mancini. Studies following the fight have concluded that his brain had become more susceptible to damage after the 12th round. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 three-minute rounds with 1 minute in between, making the total bout 47 minutes long.\nScoring.\nIf the bout \"goes the distance\", meaning that the scheduled time has fully elapsed, the outcome is determined by decision. In the early days of boxing, the referee decided the outcome by raising the winner's arm at the end of the bout, a practice that is still used for some professional bouts in the United Kingdom. In the early twentieth century, it became the practice for the referee or judge to score bouts by the number of rounds won by each boxer. To improve the reliability of scoring, two ringside judges were added besides the referee, and the winner was decided by majority decision. Since the late twentieth century, it has become common practice for the judges to be three ringside observers who award a score to each boxer for each round, with the referee having the authority to deduct points for certain violations.\nAt the conclusion of the bout, each of the three judges tallies the points awarded to each boxer. A winner is declared if at least two judges score the bout in favour of the same boxer. The result is either a (win by) “unanimous decision”, by “majority decision” (if the third judge scores a draw), or by “split decision” (if the third judge scores the bout in favour of the other boxer). Otherwise, the result is a draw: a “unanimous draw” (if all three judges scored the bout a draw), a “majority draw” (if two judges scored the bout a draw, regardless of the result reached by the third judge), or a “split draw” (if each boxer was the winner on one scorecard, and the third judge scored a draw).\n10-point system.\nThe \"10-point system\" was first introduced in 1968 by the World Boxing Council (WBC) as a rational way of scoring fights. It was viewed as such because it allowed judges to reward knockdowns and distinguish between close rounds, as well as rounds where one fighter clearly dominated their opponent. Furthermore, the subsequent adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, allowed for greater judging consistency, which was something that was sorely needed at the time. There are many factors that inform the judge's decision but the most important of these are: clean punching, effective aggressiveness, ring generalship and defense. Judges use these metrics as a means of discerning which fighter has a clear advantage over the other, regardless of how minute the advantage.\nDevelopment.\nModern boxing rules were initially derived from the Marquess of Queensberry rules which mainly outlined core aspects of the sport, such as the establishment of rounds and their duration, as well as the determination of proper attire in the ring such as gloves and wraps. These rules did not, however, provide unified guidelines for scoring fights and instead left this in the hands of individual sanctioning organizations. This meant that fights would be scored differently depending on the rules established by the governing body overseeing the fight. It is from this environment that the 10-point system evolved. The adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, established the foundation for greater judging consistency in professional boxing.\nUsage.\nIn the event the winner of a bout cannot be determined by a knockout, technical knockout, or disqualification, the final decision rests in the hands of three ringside judges approved by the commission. The three judges are usually seated along the edge of the boxing ring, separated from each other. The judges are forbidden from sharing their scores with each other or consulting with one another. At the end of each round, judges must hand in their scores to the referee who then hands them to the clerk who records and totals the final scores. Judges are to award 10 points (less any point deductions) to the victor of the round and a lesser score (less any point deductions) to the loser. The losing contestant's score can vary depending on different factors.\nThe \"10-point must\" system is the most widely used scoring system since the mid-20th century. It is so named because a judge \"must\" award 10 points to at least one fighter each round (before deductions for fouls). A scoring of 10–9 is commonly seen, with 10 points for the fighter who won the round, and 9 points for the fighter the judge believes lost the round. If a round is judged to be even, it is scored 10–10. For each knockdown in a round, the judge typically deducts an additional point from the fighter knocked down, resulting in a 10–8 score if there is one knockdown or a 10–7 score if there are two knockdowns. If the referee instructs the judges to deduct a point for a foul, this deduction is applied after the preliminary computation. So, if a fighter wins a round, but is penalised for a foul, the score changes from 10–9 to 9–9. If that same fighter scored a knockdown in the round, the score would change from 10–8 in his favour to 9–8. While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but does not score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10–8. If the referee declares a fighter going down to be a knockdown, the judges must score it as such.\nIf a fight is stopped due to an injury that the referee has ruled to be the result of an unintentional foul, the fight goes to the scorecards only if a specified number of rounds (usually three, sometimes four) have been completed. Whoever is ahead on the scorecards wins by a technical decision. If the required number of rounds has not been completed, the fight is declared a technical draw or a no contest.\nIf a fight is stopped due to a cut resulting from a legal punch, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut.\nVariants.\nOther scoring systems have also been used in various locations, including the five-point must system (in which the winning fighter is awarded five points, the loser four or fewer), the one-point system (in which the winning fighter is awarded one or more points, and the losing fighter is awarded zero), and the rounds system which simply awards the round to the winning fighter. In the rounds system, the bout is won by the fighter determined to have won more rounds. This system often used a supplemental points system (generally the 10-point must) in the case of even rounds.\nChampionships.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, the United States became the centre for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the \"world champions\" were those listed by the \"Police Gazette.\" After 1920, the National Boxing Association (NBA) began to sanction \"title fights\". Also during that time, \"The Ring\" was founded, and it listed champions and awarded championship belts. The NBA was renamed in 1962 and became the World Boxing Association (WBA). The following year, a rival body, the World Boxing Council (WBC) was formed. In 1983, the International Boxing Federation (IBF) was formed. In 1988, another world sanctioning body, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) was formed. In the 2010s a boxer had to be recognised by these four bodies to be the undisputed world champion; minor bodies like the International Boxing Organization (IBO) and World Boxing Union (WBU) are disregarded. Regional sanctioning bodies such as the North American Boxing Federation (NABF), the North American Boxing Council (NABC) and the United States Boxing Association (USBA) also awarded championships. \"The Ring\" magazine also continued listing the world champion of each weight division, and its rankings continue to be appreciated by fans."

        "text": "Amateur boxing is a variant of boxing practiced at the collegiate level, at the Olympic Games, Pan American Games and Commonwealth Games, as well as many associations.\nAmateur boxing bouts are short in duration, comprising three rounds of three minutes in men, and four rounds of two minutes in women, each with a one-minute interval between rounds. Men's senior bouts changed in format from four two-minute rounds to three three-minute rounds on January 1, 2009. This type of competition prizes point-scoring blows, based on number of clean punches landed, rather than physical power. Also, this short format allows tournaments to feature several bouts over several days, unlike professional boxing, where fighters rest several months between bouts.\nA referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows (a belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing \"low blows\" is disqualified). Referees also ensure that the boxers do not use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from punching (if this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized, or ultimately, disqualified). Referees have to stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, or if one boxer is significantly dominating the other.\nOlympic-style boxing is now an official term used for all amateur boxing events sanctioned by the AIBA. Until 2016, only amateur boxers were allowed to compete at the Olympic boxing events. In June 2016, the AIBA amended its rules to allow for professional boxers to participate in the Summer Olympics. In the United States, collegiate boxers usually switch to professional boxing after playing at the Olympics or other amateur boxing events of international importance. However, this practice is not typical in all countries. Olympians are often compared to top-ranked professionals in terms of skills, and as a rule receive a quick start in world professional rankings for granted upon turning pro.\nHistory.\nEarly beginnings.\nAmateur boxing emerged as a sport during the mid-to-late 19th century, partly as a result of the moral controversies surrounding professional prize-fighting. Originally lampooned as an effort by upper and middle-class gentlemen to co-opt a traditionally working class sport, the safer, \"scientific\" style of boxing found favour in schools, universities and in the armed forces, although the champions still usually came from among the urban poor.\nDevelopment.\nThe Queensberry Amateur Championships continued from 1867 to 1885, and so, unlike their professional counterparts, amateur boxers did not deviate from using gloves once the Queensberry Rules had been published. In England, the Amateur Boxing Association (A.B.A.) was formed in 1880 when twelve clubs affiliated. It held its first championships the following year. Four weight classes were contested: Featherweight (9 stone), Lightweight (10 stone), Middleweight (11 stone, 4 pounds) and Heavyweight (no limit). (A stone is equal to 14 pounds.) By 1902, American boxers were contesting the titles in the A.B.A. Championships, which, therefore, took on an international complexion. By 1924, the A.B.A. had 105 clubs in affiliation.\nBoxing first appeared at the Olympic Games in 1904 and, apart from the Games of 1912, has always been part of them. From 1904 to 2020, the United States and Cuba won the most gold medals; 50 for the U.S. (117 overall) and 41 (78 overall) for Cuba. Internationally, amateur boxing spread steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century, but when the first international body, the Fédération Internationale de Boxe Olympique (International Olympic Boxing Federation) was formed in Paris in 1920, there were only five member nations.\nIn 1946, however, when the International Amateur Boxing Association (A.I.B.A.) was formed in London, twenty-four nations from five continents were represented, and the A.I.B.A. has continued to be the official world federation of amateur boxing ever since. The first World Amateur Boxing Championships were staged in 1974, prior to that only regional championships took place, the only worldwide event apart from the Olympics were World Military Boxing Championships first conducted in 1947 and ever since by the CISM.\nResults.\nThe results of amateur boxing match-ups are usually registered, protocolled, and published in a local, regional, national or international press, and broadcast by various media (depending on type, level and importance of the match, and athletes participating,) from the largest international media Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, covering the major international events, to bulletin-board-type of newspapers covering local events.\nBouts which end this way may be noted in English or in French (which was the AIBA official language.) Amateur boxing does not recognize terms \"knockout\", and \"technical knockout\", instead it use the following euphemisms:\nAll wins, losses, or mismatches except for those achieved by way of a clean knockout, or \"in absentia\", are disputable, and could be contested legally through an appeal to the governing bodies.\nScoring.\nAmateur boxing to this day have several scoring systems, depending on the tournament regulations and sanctioning authority. Several archaic score systems, that survived to the 1980s (and in some places to this day,) the first of which is a 3-point system, which gave one point for each of three rounds (therefore 3–0 stands for a clean victory by points, 2–1 means that defeated opponent dominated one round, 1–1–1 stands for a draw or \"ex aequo\", which was a very rare occurrence.) It coexisted for a long time with 3-vote decision system, and 5-vote decision system, which resembled professional boxing decision-making system, it took five judges voting either for victory or a draw (in the 5-vote system, 5–0 stands for unanimous decision, 4–1 for majority decision, 3–2 for split decision, 3–1–1 for split decision and one judge ruled a draw. In the 3-vote system, 3–0 stands for unanimous decision, 2–1 for split decision, 0–0–3 for a draw, with no majority decision option.) Depending on the tournament regulations an extra round or rounds could be appointed on the sudden death principle if there was no clear winner. All mentioned systems were practised in combination with each other (i.e. judges were supposed not only to pick up a winner, but also to fill-in scorecards,) creating complexity with points, scorecards, etc. Tournaments and championships usually employed the 5-vote system. International duals usually employed the 3-vote system, with two judges represented the guest nation, and one judge represented the host nation. Both systems lead to a number of controversial and officially contested results, as punch statistics (thrown-to-landed) mostly wasn't accounted for by either one. At the 1960 Rome Olympics preliminaries, after Soviet Oleg Grigoryev was controversially ruled a winner over Great Britain's Francis Taylor, the IOC decided to relieve some 15 of the referees and judges of their duties before the quarterfinals. After the 1988 Seoul Olympics controversy, when the clearly dominant finalist Roy Jones Jr. of the U.S. (whom even the Soviet judges ruled to be a winner, let alone the commentators and his beaten opponent, who himself apologized for the injustice) was virtually robbed of the gold medal, a new system was created and implemented, where only clean punches score, though a controversy still exist as to what is a \"clean\" punch in one's personal opinion, leading to another dubious results. The semifinals of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics proved the new points system susceptible to controversy as well, when Kazakhstani Vassiliy Jirov was pronounced a 15–9 score winner over U.S. Antonio Tarver, with many observers were left confused, believing Tarver was dominant through the entire bout.\nComputer scoring was introduced to the Olympics in 1992. Each of the five judges had a keypad with a red and a blue button. The judges pressed a button for which ever corner they felt landed a scoring blow. Three out of the five judges had to press the button for the same boxer within a one-second window in order for the point to score. A legal scoring blow was that which is landed cleanly with the knuckle surface of the glove, within the scoring area from the middle of the head, down the sides and between the hips through the belly button. In case of a tied match, each judge would determine a winner.\nThe AIBA introduced a new scoring system in January 2011. Each judge gives an individual score for each boxer. The score given to each boxer would be taken from 3 out of 5 judges either by similar score or trimmed mean. Scores are no longer tracked in real time and are instead given at the end of each round.\nOn March 13, 2013, the computer scoring system was abandoned, with amateur boxing instead using the ten point must system, similar to professional boxing. Unlike professional boxing, there is no advantage for a knockdown in scoring. At the end of the match, each judge must determine which boxer won the fight. That will be used in case all scores are tied (there can be no draws in amateur boxing). Furthermore, if a match is stopped early, the match is official and all rounds count towards an official winner, even a partially completed round.\nAwards.\nAmateur boxing awards system in essence duplicates the Olympic awards system with minor differences:\nThe United States tournaments and championships (except for those affiliated with World Boxing), contrary to European equivalent, usually do not award silver medals and bronze medals for 2nd and 3rd place respectively, as they acknowledge only the winners. Hence its colloquial name \"Golden Gloves\" (implying the winner takes all principle, which they are based upon.) This is a parallel to professional boxing, which also doesn't use such terms as \"second place\" or \"third place\", it accepts only \"champion\" and \"challenger\".\nProtective equipment.\nIn March 2016, protective headgear that had been in use since 1982 was removed from men's competition due to higher concussion rates occurring in fights using headgear than in fights without the headgear. Women's competition was unaffected, as the AIBA announced that there wasn't enough data on its effects on women. This ruling was in place at the 2016 Summer Olympics. \nProfessional admittance.\nOn several occasions in the 1990s, professional boxers, mostly from the post-Soviet states, resumed their amateur careers, namely: Nikolay Kulpin and Oleg Maskaev in 1993, Nikolai Valuev in 1994, Ruslan Chagaev in 1998.\nIn June 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the Olympic Games and other tournaments sanctioned by the AIBA. This was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-Soviet republics have. However, professional organizations strongly opposed that decision.\nAs it is accustomed to in the West, amateur boxers do not compete at the Olympiads consecutively, they turn pro right after they participated in the Games or in other sporting event of international importance, while boxers from Cuba and certain post-Soviet states, which have professional sports there banned today or had it previously, are state-sponsored and frequently stay on in the amateurs, while being arguably professionals \"de facto\", and compete in multiple Olympics.\nCompetitions.\nContrary to professional boxing, which utilizes lineal system, amateur boxing events are different in principle (although professional and amateur cards could appear much similar to each other).\nTypes of competition.\nChampionships are usually divided into the following age-limited subcategories:\nThe following ring-experience-oriented divisions are usually represented at tournaments:\nThere are also specific types of contest for servicemen and jailed people:\nIn terms of weight classes contests could be either:\nAbsolute championships without weight limits completely or in two weight classes (over/under 91 kilogram) took place in socialist countries in the absence of professional boxing, allowing to determine country's undisputed champion regardless of weight (over 91: usually contested by light heavyweights and heavyweights; under 91: contested by middleweights with significant other advantages to compensate the weight disparity.) Competitions other than absolute, always had strict weight regulations, weigh-in procedures, etc.\nGoverning bodies.\nEssentially, there are three governing bodies in amateur boxing, which rule internationally:\nDisbanded governing bodies.\nCollegiate-level boxing competitions in the United States are usually regulated by one of two organizations: the National Collegiate Boxing Association (created in 1978) or the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association (formed in 2012).\nNational competitions.\nUnited States.\nThere are several different amateur sanctioning bodies in the United States, including the National AAU Boxing Committee, Golden Gloves Association of America and United States Amateur Boxing Federation (presently known as USA Boxing.)\nThe Golden Gloves is an amateur boxing tournament that is fought at both the national level and the regional level. Although the Golden Gloves typically refers to the National Golden Gloves, it can also refer to the Intercity Golden Gloves, the Chicago Golden Gloves, the New York Golden Gloves, and other regional Golden Gloves tournaments. The winners of the regional tournaments fight in a national competition annually.\nUSA Boxing also sanctions a national tournament to determine who will compete on the United States national boxing team at the Olympic Games (either directly qualifying for the Olympics or through worldwide or regional qualifying tournaments).\nCanada.\nSince 1969, amateur boxing in Canada has been regulated by the Canadian Amateur Boxing Association (Boxing Canada) and the various member provincial associations.\nSome of the main tournaments include Provincial Championships, Golden Gloves, Silver Gloves, Emerald Gloves and Buckskin Gloves.\nCelebrity boxing.\nThe late 2010’s and early 2020s saw advent of celebrity boxing matches, when certain media celebrities, usually Internet and TV personalities, YouTubers, etc., challenged one another. The latest of such matches was the KSI vs. Logan Paul, a white-collar amateur boxing match between the British YouTuber, Olajide \"JJ\" Olatunji (known online as KSI), and American YouTuber, Logan Paul. The fight was promoted as \"the biggest internet event in history\" and \"the biggest amateur boxing match in history\". With the result being a draw, KSI retained the Youtube championship belt he got from the KSI vs. Joe Weller fight which he won in the way of TKO 1m 30 sec into the 3rd round. The belt was presented to KSI by professional boxer Derek Chisora at the end of his fight with Weller. The YouTube championship belt is of red colour with gold motifs. Its design features an eagle with its wings fully spread atop a golden globe with a crown at its centre. The rematch took place on 9 November 2019 at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, this time as a professional boxing match. KSI won the rematch by split decision after going the full distance of six three minute rounds."

        "text": "The 2006 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament was held from March 18 to April 4, 2006, at several sites, with the championship game held in Boston. The Maryland Terrapins, coached by Brenda Frese, won their first National Championship, beating the Duke Blue Devils, coached by Gail Goestenkors, 78–75 in overtime. Laura Harper of the Terrapins was named Most Outstanding Player.\nThe field is set at 64 teams, with 31 automatic bids and 33 at-large bids. Unlike the men's game, there is no play-in game. In addition, the first two rounds and regionals are usually played on \"neutral\" sites.\nAs of the 2023 tournament, this is the last Final Four where all four teams were coached by women. \nUntil the 2023 tournament, this was the last Women's final four not to include \"either\" Connecticut or Tennessee.\nNotable events.\nIn the Albuquerque Regional, Boston College upset the number one seed, Ohio State, in the second round. BC went on to play fifth seeded Utah in the regional semifinal, but Utah won by three points. Utah then played Maryland in the Regional final. With under eight seconds to go in regulation, Utah was trailing by a single point, with Shona Thorburn at the free throw line for two shots. She only made one, and the game went into overtime. This was familiar territory for the Terrapins, who were now playing in the fifth overtime game of their season. They had won the previous four, and would outscore Utah 12–2 to advance to the Final Four.\nIn the Bridgeport Regional, Connecticut won their first two games easily, then faced Georgia in their home state. The Huskies started out poorly, going without a single point for a stretch of over six minutes and were down 25–10 with under seven minutes to go in the first half. Then UConn scored 22 of the next 23 points to take a six-point lead. Georgia did not quit, and with seconds left, had a one-point lead. UConn had the ball and set up a last-ditch play. The play broke down, but Barbara Turner, not known as a three-point shooter, hit a three-pointer to put Connecticut up by two points with under two seconds to play. Georgia took a desperation, length of the court shot which bounced off the rim, and Connecticut held on to advance to the regional final. UConn head coach Geno Auriemma was quoted as saying, \"I told the guys in the locker room, there are times that if you are lucky, fate taps you on the shoulder and you are ready. And today, we were ready\".\nIn the regional final, top seeded Duke faced second seed UConn. With Connecticut down by two points late in the game, the Huskies Mel Thomas hit a two pint jumper to tie the game at 55 points apiece. Duke had 20 seconds left to hit a shot to take the lead. They called a timeout to set up a play but it broke down, and they called a timeout with three seconds left. The inbound pass ended up near half court, where an attempted buzzer beater bounced off the backboard, and the game went into overtime. The Blue Devils pulled out to a five-point lead with under three minutes to go, but did not score another point. UConn had the ball for a final play, down by two points, but Charde Houston missed an open jumper, and Duke won the right to go to the Final Four in Boston.\nThe Cleveland Regional got off to a newsworthy start during Tennessee's opening round game against Army, when the Lady Vols' Candace Parker because first woman to dunk in an NCAA tournament game and the first woman to dunk twice in a college game. Ultimately though, the top four seeds advance to the regional semifinals, the top two to the final, and top seed North Carolina beat Tennessee to advance to the Final Four. It was their first trip to the Final Four for the Tarheels since 1994, when they had won the National Championship. \nThe San Antonio Regional also largely followed the seeding, although third-seeded Stanford upset Oklahoma to reach the regional final. Although top seeded LSU was down by five points at halftime, they came back to beat Stanford by three points to earn a trip to the Final Four. LSU had only a one-point lead, when Candice Wiggins drove to the basket but Seimone Augustus stood in the way and took a charge. Wiggins had passed the ball to Krista Rappahahn who hit a three-pointer, but it was waved off because of the charge.\nLSU was one of just seven schools to place both their men's and women's basketball teams in the Final Four in the same year. But one night after the men lost by double digits to UCLA, the women lost as well. Duke had a double-digit lead at halftime, which LSU cut to six points, but Duke then went on an 11–1 run to build the lead back up. Duke won the game 64–55 to head to the championship game.\nNorth Carolina entered the other semifinal against Maryland with only a single loss on the season, but that loss was to Maryland. The first half was close, with Maryland holding just a two-point lead at the half. The Terrapins extended the lead in the second half to double digits, but North Carolina came back to cut the lead to three points with just over a minute left in the game. They would get no closer, and Maryland held on to win 81–70 to advance to the final game.\nThe semifinal wins set up an all-ACC championship game, between the two highest scoring teams in Division I. Duke had won 14 of the last 15 meetings between the two teams, but the sole win by Maryland in the streak was the most recent—the ACC semifinal match up. This game started as if it were a return to the usual results, with Duke reaching a double-digit lead at halftime, and extending to a 13-point lead in the second half. Maryland fought back, and with seconds to go in the game Kristi Toliver hit a three-pointer to tie the game. The game went into overtime, the sixth time this season Maryland had been in an overtime game. The Terrapins had won all five prior overtimes games, and this would be no different. Although down in overtime, Toliver hit two free throws to put her team back in front, and Maryland held on to win their first National Championship.\nLocations.\nThe tournament once again used the pod system, meaning that teams were more likely to play closer to home earlier in the tournament. The sites for the first two rounds were as follows:\nThe Regional sites for this year (named after the city, a practice that is in use for the second consecutive year) were:\nThe winners of the regionals advanced to the Final Four, held at TD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts on April 2–4, 2006, hosted by Harvard University and Northeastern University.\nQualifying teams - automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2006 NCAA Tournament.

        "title": "London Lions (basketball)",
        "text": "London Lions are a British professional basketball team based in Stratford, East London, England, and compete in the British Basketball League as well as the EuroCup.\nThe team was originally founded in 1977 as the Hemel Hempstead Lakers, and was previously based in Hemel Hempstead, following ownership take over by Vince Macaulay two seasons in Hemel Hempstead then meant relocation to Watford and notably Milton Keynes, where they were known as Milton Keynes Lions. It was in Milton Keynes that the team won its first silverware in 2008, the BBL Cup. The Lions relocated to London in 2012 and play its home games at the Copper Box Arena in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as well as occasional EuroCup matches at Wembley Arena.\nIn 2017, the Lions launched a women's team into the Women's British Basketball League after partnering with and rebranding the existing Barking Abbey Crusaders team as the London Lions.\nLondon Lions is now owned by 777 Partners after they purchased the club from Macaulay ending his 27-year ownership. 777 Partners also purchased 45% of the British Basketball League (BBL) for £7m in December 2021. The balance of BBL is owned by the 10 clubs that compete in the BBL, including London, therefore, effectively 777 controls the BBL. \nHistory.\nHemel Hempstead Lakers.\nThe club initially started out based in the town of Hemel Hempstead, 24 miles northwest of London, and were known as the Hemel Hempstead Lakers. The team was named after one of the NBA’s most famous teams, Los Angeles Lakers, and even adopted the LA Lakers' colours of purple and gold. In 1977, the Lakers entered the National Basketball League’s Division 2, and enjoyed a rather successful first season, finishing fifth (from 11 teams) with a 10–10 record. Their second season would be even more successful, with the Lakers finishing second in Division 2 (15–3) and winning promotion to the top-level league Division 1.\nWith entry into the country's top league ensured, the club received a major sponsorship deal from beverage brand Ovaltine, and as part of the deal were known as Ovaltine Hemel Hempstead. The franchise became a formidable force in Division 1, regularly finishing at the top-end of the table and making many appearances in the Play-off semi-finals at Wembley Arena, finishing third in 1981. Following the end of the Ovaltine sponsorship and a one-year deal with retailers Poundstretcher, the franchise was rebranded as the Hemel Royals in 1985. Meanwhile, on court, the team failed to reproduce the performances of the past few seasons and often settled for mid-table positions. This was a golden period in British Basketball and Hemel regularly brought top American talent from the States. Dick Miller is the greatest defensive player in the franchise's history and probably the game as a whole in the UK. The enigmatic Harvey Knuckles is considered one of the greatest players ever to play in Britain. Steve Hale was a fourth round draft pick, Sam Smith scored big points from all round the court and Daryl Thomas was a prolific scorer.\nFor the 1989–1990 season the franchise opted to leave the top-tier (now known as the Carlsberg League due to sponsorship from the Carlsberg Group) and return to the second-tier league, which had been renamed as NBL Division 1. After only one season, and a fourth-place finish (14–8), the Royals returned to Carlsberg League. The team finished bottom of the league in the 1992–1993 season with a 4–29 record, and were subsequently relegated back to Division 1, however they were later reinstated and returned to the rebranded BBL for the following season. A dismal spell ensued and over the next decade the team wouldn't finish outside of the bottom three, but with the removal of the promotion/relegation system between the BBL and Division 1, this had little consequence.\nWatford Royals.\nThe lack of fortune and an aging venue prompted the franchise to look at relocating and the team found a suitable, yet temporary solution in the neighbouring town of Watford. In preparation for the move, the franchise was rebranded as Hemel &amp; Watford Royals in 1996 and they made the move from the Dacorum Centre to Watford Leisure Centre in 1997. The move had little effect on the team's playing performance and they finished 13th out of 13 in the 1997–1998 season (3–33). Royals' stay in Watford lasted just one season and, in 1998, with the promise of a future purpose-built arena being offered in the town of Milton Keynes, the team packed up, moved and renamed themselves as the Milton Keynes Lions.\nMilton Keynes Lions.\nLions' on-court performances were an instant improvement and the franchise began a slow but noticeable turnaround, reaching the semi-finals of the National Cup and also the end-of-season Play-offs for the first time in eight seasons in 2000. After a hugely successful run, the franchise reached its first major final in 2002 with an appearance at the SkyDome Arena in the BBL Trophy. The Lions fought valiantly but eventually lost to the all-conquering Chester Jets, losing 90–89 in a close contest. From then on, the Lions remained a competitive force in the league, often qualifying for the post-season Play-offs (though having little impact on the final outcome), and an appearance in the BBL Cup Semi-final in 2005 was considered to be a major landmark.\n2007–08 season\nIt was announced on 8 May 2007 that coach Tom Hancock would not coach the Lions for the 2007–08 season, after just one term at the helm. On 17 May, the club declared owner Vince Macaulay-Razaq, a former player and coach of the franchise, would be appointed head coach for the proceeding season. The signing of Yorick Williams during the pre-season was a massive coup, and for many fans signalled the dawning of a new era for the club. During this exciting time and in preparation for a planned move to a new arena, the club also undertook a rebranding initiative, redesigning the logo and changing the kit colours from the traditional purple and gold, to a more dynamic black, gold and white, as well as the establishment of a new Academy in partnership with Milton Keynes College. The Milton Keynes College Lions Basketball Academy is headed by Lions' player Mike New.\nWith Macaulay back controlling the club on court as well as off it, the team's standing in the league was immediately matched to his own ambition as the club's owner. The veteran team performed sensationally and by the Christmas break they were well in contention for the league crown, resting in second place behind title-rivals Newcastle Eagles, who coincidentally they beat in their first-ever BBL Cup Final appearance at the National Indoor Arena (NIA), on 13 January 2008. Milton Keynes led for most of the game and sealed the 69–66 victory when New scored the final points of the game to end a Newcastle resurgence, handing the Lions franchise its first piece of silverware.\nAfter finishing 4th in the league (19–14), Lions qualified for the post-season Play-offs with a seeded home-court Quarter-final tie against Scottish Rocks. The home team eased past the Rocks, 105–93, with the game filmed live in front of Setanta Sports cameras. For the first time in its history, Milton Keynes progressed to the Championship Finals weekend at the NIA where they defeated league champions Newcastle Eagles (63–72) on the way to the final eventually succumbing to Guildford Heat, 88–100, again live on Setanta Sports. The incredible achievements of the season, earned coach Macaulay-Razaq the accolade of BBL's Coach of the Year. Another highlight of the Lions' most successful season in history was the development of players through the new Academy with 18-year-old Greg Harvey progressing onto the roster in the latter stages of the season.\n2008–09 season\nAs of 2008, Lions expected to be playing at the brand-new 4,500-seat capacity adjacent to the new (home to Milton Keynes Dons football team). The move to their new home would have seen the Lions play in one of the BBL's biggest, modern venues, rivalling the homes of the Rocks and Newcastle. Unfortunately, the completion of the arena was delayed due to the deferral of proposed commercial developments around the site (which would have funded the project). With the demolition of Lions' current home, Bletchley Centre, scheduled for November 2009, the lack of an alternative venue raised question marks as to the future of the franchise remaining in Milton Keynes.\nOn court, there were big expectations following the successful campaign previously, but the 2008–09 season didn't start off too well for the Lions, with defeat to Guildford in the Cup Winners' Cup. After losing 91–89 in the first leg at Guildford, the Heat rolled over the Lions to a 68–60 victory at the Bletchley Centre, and a 159–149 series win. Further woe was added with a BBL Cup Quarter-final exit at the hands of visiting Everton Tigers, coupled with an exit at the 1st round of the Trophy. The disastrous season came to an abrupt end in April, with a 14–19 record and 9th-placed finish meaning the Lions missing out on the end-of-season Playoffs.\n2009–10 season \nWith the demolition of the Bletchley Centre looming, the club sought to find an alternative venue for home games and on 31 July 2009 announced that from January 2010, the Lions would be playing out of Middleton Hall at thecentre:mk as a temporary measure until the new arena:mk was due to be completed, later in the year. The Lions played their last game in front of a packed Bletchley Centre crowd on 18 December, with a dramatic 98–97 victory over Guildford Heat. Robert Youngblood scored the winning point from the free-throw line and thus scored the last basket for Lions at their former home.\nAfter Middleton Hall decided upon changes that would no longer make it suitable for basketball, the Lions were forced yet again to search for another new home venue, for at least the 2010–2011 season. The club secured a three-game lease for an out-of-town venue at Stoke Mandeville in Aylesbury to begin their 2010–2011 campaign, and decided upon renovating a site in the centre of Milton Keynes to host home games for the duration of the season. A three-year deal was agreed upon to use a warehouse in Winterhill and convert it into a 1,400-seat basketball arena and practice venue. The venue opened as the MK Lions Arena at the end of November 2010.\n2010–11 season \nIn his first season as head coach, former Lions player Mike New led the team to a disappointing 10th-place finish in the British Basketball League. Despite now boasting a fantastic full-time basketball venue, which featured two permanent courts – allowing the teams throughout the Lions banner to train more than ever before, the club missed out on qualifying for the play-offs. One of the few highlights of the season was the play of American guard Demarius Bolds, who was among the league leaders in several statistics as he was named Lions' Player of the Year.\n2011–12 season \n2011–12 saw the Lions miss the play-offs for a second successive season, as they finished 9th in the Championship table – one place and four points behind 8th-placed Guildford Heat for the last post-season berth. A heavy 102–67 defeat to Leicester saw elimination at the first hurdle in the BBL Cup, however the team would later go close to making the BBL Trophy final. After topping their group in round robin play, Lions won the home leg of their semi-final against Plymouth Raiders in front of a sold-out Prestige Homes Arena, before suffering a 188–186 defeat on aggregate (after OT) in the return leg. Success was however found on a personal level, as Nathan Schall won the BBL dunk competition as part of the BBL Cup Final festivities and Stefan Gill completed the dunking double as he was crowned dunk contest champion at the World Basketball Festival.\nDeparture from Milton Keynes \nFollowing the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, the owners of Prestige Homes Arena triggered an opt-out clause in the lease to let the building as a retail outlet. A planning application to change the building from a sporting facility to retail unit was approved by Milton Keynes Council, thus leaving the club without a home venue for the third time in as many seasons. Owner Vince Macaulay searched during the summer of 2012 to secure a new base for Lions home games, which included public pleas to local businesses for help in finding a new home as offers from cities around the UK poured in to relocate the team. On 17 July, a local newspaper revealed negotiations to secure the Lions' future in Milton Keynes were ongoing, with Macaulay hoping to finalise a deal with sufficient time to begin preparation for the new season, slated to begin away to the re-formed Manchester Giants on 21 September. On 30 July, with the country's interest in basketball heightened by Great Britain's participation in the London 2012 Olympic basketball tournament, Macaulay revealed his search to find a home venue had been unsuccessful and the club would be forced to leave Milton Keynes. In addition to the loss of professional basketball games, the move was a big blow to Milton Keynes residents who had enjoyed extensive community and schools' basketball programmes since the Lions arrived in 1998. It was not then known what effect the team's departure would have on the many school teams and community projects, but Macaulay stated that he wished to remain involved in the development of youth basketball in Milton Keynes in some form. Questions also remained as to the future of the Milton Keynes Lions College Academy which enabled young adults to attend basketball practice five days a week whilst furthering their education – several of whom had gone on to sign professional deals with the first team.\nWhen faced with the challenge of finding a new home outside of Milton Keynes, Macaulay shortlisted two new locations:\nFirst was Cardiff, with Macaulay stating the appeal of every game feeling like Wales versus England being an exciting prospect. However, he ultimately found that agreeing to a deal with the proposed arena's owners would be unlikely before the deadline he was facing of the start of the next season.\nSecond was Liverpool, Macaulay's hometown. Liverpool already had a BBL franchise – the Mersey Tigers, however, they were in financial trouble so Macaulay proposed merging the two teams and a 50/50 ownership. The current owners were interested but wanted Macaulay to send them his CV. Somewhat offended, he knew such a working relationship was unlikely to work, so withdrew his proposal. The Mersey Tigers folded the following season.\nCompletely out of options during the summer of 2012, Macaulay noted a lot of talk about the legacy of the London 2012 Olympic Games and investigated whether there would be any venues that could potentially become home for a basketball team once the games were over. Ultimately he entered discussions with the new owners of the Copper Box Arena, and the Milton Keynes Lions, soon to be the London Lions, had a new home.\nMove to London.\nOn 8 August 2012, an article in the \"Milton Keynes Citizen\" newspaper revealed the Lions would be moving to London for the 2012–13 season, taking residence at the Copper Box Arena in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. As the Copper Box was being used for handball during the 2012 Summer Olympics and goalball during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the venue needed to be converted for basketball use, and the Lions, therefore, began the season playing home games at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. Owner Vince Macaulay-Razaq revealed the Lions would maintain links in Milton Keynes by keeping the Milton Keynes College Lions Basketball Academy open.\n2012–13 season\nFollowing the Lions' move to London, head coach Mike New elected to remain in Milton Keynes and continue his work as head coach of the Milton Keynes College Lions Basketball Academy. Lions owner Vince Macaulay coached the team for the 2012–13 season. London Lions played its home games at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre until the Copper Box Arena had been converted for basketball use following its role as handball arena during the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n2013–14 season \nLondon Lions was successfully launched as the only professional basketball club in London. The team finished 6th in the regular season before losing to Worcester Wolves in the playoffs quarter-finals.\n2014–15 season\nThe two previous seasons' BBL MVPs, Drew Sullivan and Zaire Taylor, were recruited for the 2014–15 season. The Lions reached the semi-finals of the BBL Trophy, losing to Leicester Riders. They finished 6th in the regular season. In the playoffs, the Lions defeated Worcester Wolves in the quarter-finals and Cheshire Phoenix in the semi-finals. The final, played in front of 14,700 at The O2 Arena, was won by Newcastle Eagles, who completed the clean sweep of British basketball titles.\n2015–16 season\nNigel Lloyd took over as head coach for the 2015–16 season. Joe Ikhinmwin, the only senior player retained from the previous season's run to the play-off final, was made captain. Olumide Oyedeji would later rejoin in October following a serious injury to Demond Watt. Alex Owumi signed in December following further roster changes. The season ended with defeat to Sheffield Sharks in the play-off quarter-finals, on their way to winning the trophy.\n2016–17 season\nA more stable summer saw Nigel Lloyd remain in charge, bringing back Alex Owumi, Andre Lockhart, Jamal Williams, Joseph \"Jei\" Blessing Ikhinmwin and Kai Williams. Zaire Taylor also returned after a year away, along with Derek Hall and Rashad Hassan. A 9–1 start to the season in all competitions suggested great promise, but the departure of Hall after only 3 games and a season-ending injury to Jamal Williams disrupted the team's form. Defeat to Newcastle Eagles in the BBL Cup followed shortly afterwards. Reinforcements arrived in the shape of Navid Niktash and Zak Wells but the early season form couldn't be recaptured.\n2017–18 season \nAfter Lloyd stepped down as head coach at the beginning of the 17–18 season, Mariusz Karol was appointed as head coach and lead the team to a 9–3 start before losing 4 out of the next 6. This led to a mutual agreement with team management for him to step down as head coach and club director / owner Vince Macaulay-Razaq to become head coach.\n2018–19 season \nThe team won its first silverware since rebranding as London Lions, beating Glasgow Rocks in the BBL Cup Final. They were beaten in the BBL Trophy Final by London City Royals, before winning the BBL league championship. Justin Robinson won his second BBL MVP award in a row.\n2019–20 season \nLions changed their colours from their traditional purple and gold to black, silver and white. The season was curtailed prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no champions being named.\nEuropean debut.\nIn the 2020–21 season, the Lions played in a European competition for the first time in club history. They were confirmed to have a spot in the qualifying rounds for the fifth season of the Basketball Champions League (BCL). however they failed to qualify for the tournament proper, losing 77–73 to Neptūnas in the single game qualifying tie.\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Lions made their debut in the FIBA Europe Cup, which meant their debut in the group phase of a European competition. On 13 October 2021, the Lions beat Donar Groningen away to register their first-ever European win.\nEurocup debut.\nIn the 2022/23 season the London Lions appeared in the Eurocup for the first time, reaching the playoffs but being knocked out in the first round. \nIn the 2023/24 season the Lions went further, reaching the semi-finals of Europe’s second-tier competition before being beaten by heavy tournament favourites Paris Basketball.\nHome arenas.\nNote: Between 1998 and 2002, some home games were played at Planet Ice Milton Keynes for TV broadcasting purposes. Between 2017 and 2020, some home games were played at University of East London SportsDock and Brixton Recreation Centre. In the 2022-23 season, some European home games were played at Wembley Arena.\nHonours.\nBBL Championship\nBBL Play-offs\nBBL Cup\nBBL Trophy\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section begin=roster /&gt;\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nDepth chart.\n&lt;section begin=depthchart /&gt;"

        "title": "International Cricket Captain",
        "text": "Cricket Captain, formerly International Cricket Captain, is a series of cricket management video games by Empire Interactive, and by Childish Things since \"International Cricket Captain 2009\", before which Empire went into administration. It rose to popularity in 1998, following the release of the first PC-based game in the series. The most recent version of the game is \"Cricket Captain 2022.\"\nThe concept for \"International Cricket Captain\" was the idea of Chris Child, who programmed the original game engine as a university project. Empire producer Brian Walker produced and co-designed the game in which the player takes control of an English County Cricket squad with the aim of leading them to success in the domestic competition and ultimately being asked to take up the position of England manager. There is also an added option in later games in the \"ICC\" series to take control of one of the other Test playing nations.\nTaking inspiration from the hugely successful Championship Manager series of games which were also produced by Brian Walker, most aspects of a management sim are present in \"ICC\", with the ability to coach players on their individual skills, scout opposition and buy and sell players at the end of each season. There are also comprehensive statistics available in the form of career stats pages for each player and team. Graphs and charts help the gamer to select the strongest team possible against particular opposition.\nTransition to console.\nAlthough mainly a PC based series, there have been console cross-overs, most notably for \"ICC 2001\" which appeared on the PlayStation. However, the PS version was limited in features compared to its PC cousin and as a result was not very successful. Aside from the lack of on-line play capability, gamers noted that the transition to the console meant longer loading periods and a slightly more tedious controller-based interface.\nGame engine revamp.\nICC III was released on 6 July 2007 including a new algorithmic method of calculating player performances and a 3D match engine with motion captured shots. These changes are arguably a result of the competition that International Cricket Captain now faces from the popular \"Cricket Coach\" series, developed by Rockingham Software. The new engine replaces the original graphic highlights which were retained for each of the previous versions of the game, save minor cosmetic tweaks.\nCriticism.\nOver recent years, a common criticism from games reviewers is of the perceived lack of progress in terms of the game's functionality, with the obvious change between versions tending to be limited to updated players and statistics.\nGames in the series.\nInternational Cricket Captain.\nThe player is able to take control of the English County side of their choice from the 1998 Season with the aim of becoming accomplished enough to captain the English national side.\nThe player must guide their chosen County Championship side through an English cricket season, playing English county cricket as well as regular first class matches. During close season, contract negotiations take place in which players are transferred between clubs or retire from the game altogether. There is also a pool of overseas players (from which the player can sign only one, in line with the regulations of the time).\nThe player receives a new points total each season based on their performance. If they have accrued enough points they are invited to coach the England team. This involves selecting a squad from the extensive pool of English county players and managing them in One Day International and Test Matches, including an annual winter tour. The game continues for twenty seasons until 2018, at which point the player is forced into retirement and the game ends.\nAustralian Cricket Captain.\n\"Australian Cricket Captain\", featuring Australian State teams and competitions, was released to the Australasian market in 1999. The game is almost identical to the original release in terms of gameplay aside from a revamp of the contracting system and minor cosmetic tweaks. There is also a commentary by former Australian captain Ian Chappell.\nSequels.\nNew releases of \"International Cricket Captain\" were made every year, with primarily minor cosmetic changes. These games are \"International Cricket Captain 2\", \"International Cricket Captain 2000\", \"International Cricket Captain 2001\" (and the \"Ashes Edition\"), \"International Cricket Captain 2002\", and \"International Cricket Captain 2005\" (and the \"Ashes Edition\").\nInternational Cricket Champion 2006.\n\"International Cricket Captain 2006\" was released on the PC. In England, batsmen Kevin Pietersen is featured on the cover, whereas the Australian version features fast bowler Brett Lee.\nWhen playing single player you can choose one of four modes to play.\nInternational Cricket Captain 2006 featured online play where you could take on another player in either a First Class or ODI match.\n\"International Cricket Captain 2006: Ashes Edition\"' is a video game, the eighth from the popular International Cricket Captain Series. It was purposely made for England's attempt to retain The Ashes in Australia. It is mainly a roster update from \"International Cricket Captain 2006\" but also includes 6 ashes scenarios.\nInternational Cricket Captain III.\n\"International Cricket Captain III\" is the ninth iteration of the ICC series.\nReleased in the summer of 2007, the game boasted the largest number of changes to the series for many versions including new 3D graphics and changes to the underlying match engine. A demo, playable for a maximum of 48 hours (two calendar days) was available at the developer's website.\nInternational Cricket Captain III is also available for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.\nInternational Cricket Captain 2008.\n\"International Cricket Captain 2008\" featured on its United Kingdom cover, England's Monty Panesar. It contained all contemporary cricket players from first class cricket, Test cricket, List-A and One Day International teams, and can be played in a career mode indefinitely, with repeating domestic and international fixtures generated for each year, along with youth players continually added and other players retiring to enable an open-ended career as coach of a national or domestic side.\nInternational Cricket Captain 2009.\n\"International Cricket Captain 2009\" is the 12th game in the series so far. It contains all current cricket players from first class cricket, Test cricket, List-A and One Day International teams, and can be played in a career mode indefinitely, with repeating domestic and international fixtures generated for each year, along with youth players continually added and other players retiring to enable an open-ended career as coach of a national or domestic side.

It was first released on 2 July as a download only from the Childish Things website, and the box version was released on 17 July 2009.\nInternational Cricket Captain 2010.\n\"International Cricket Captain 2010\" is the 13th edition of the \"International Cricket Captain\" series.

        "text": "Basketball is a sports video game programmed by Alan Miller for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed to the Atari 2600) and published by Atari, Inc. in 1978. The cartridge presents a game of one-on-one basketball for by one or two players, one of the few early VCS titles to have a single-player mode with an AI-controlled opponent. Miller wrote a version of \"Basketball\" for Atari 8-bit computers with improved graphics, published in 1979. That same year, an arcade version similar to the computer port was released by Atari but in black and white.\nGameplay.\nAt the start of the game, both players are at the center of the court. A jump ball is thrown between them to begin play. The player in the offensive position (i.e. in possession of the ball) always faces a basket representing the assigned shooting target, and defensive players always face the opponent. Each player can move in eight directions with the joystick; the player with the ball constantly dribbles it. The defensive player may steal the ball when it leaves the opponent's hands (either in mid-dribble or mid-shot).\nAfter either player scores, the shooter is reset to the center of the court and becomes the defensive player (defending the opponent) while the former defender is set under the basket to inbound the ball and take an offensive chance. The player with the highest score after four minutes is the winner.\nThe game has two difficulty levels selected with the Difficulty Switch. In \"B\" position, the player can move from goal to goal much more quickly than the \"A\" position.\nReception.\nIn \"Video\" magazine's \"Arcade Alley\" review column, reviewers described it as \"that rare game that plays well solitaire or with a human opponent,\" and noted that \"the game definitely captures the flavor of basketball.\" The \"fan's eye perspective\" was singled out for particular praise, and the game as a whole was found to \"offer the most exciting four minutes of one-on-one hoop action [the reviewers had] seen so far.\"\nLegacy.\nIn the 1980 comedy film \"Airplane!\", flight controllers are seen playing Atari VCS \"Basketball\" rather than watching the monitor."

        "text": "James Timothy Burke (October 12, 1874 – March 26, 1942) was an American Major League Baseball third baseman, coach, and manager. He played for the Cleveland Spiders, St. Louis Perfectos, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago White Stockings, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals.\nBurke was the regular third baseman for the Cardinals from 1903 to 1905. He was named player-manager in the middle of the 1905, season but was replaced by Stanley Robison after amassing a record of 34–56.\nPlaying career.\nBurke made his debut in October 1898 for the Cleveland Spiders. He was one of many players moved from Cleveland to St. Louis the following season, a move that stocked Cleveland with inferior and inept ball players that resulted in that team producing the worst record ever in Major league baseball. Burke only played a couple of games for St. Louis, now called the St. Louis Perfectos.\nIn 1901, he split time between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox of the American League. After being released by Chicago in 1901, he signed with the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates where once again he played only occasionally.\nBurke never got anywhere near close to regular playing time until he was traded by Pittsburgh to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1903, his first season with significant playing time, he batted .285 and rove in 42 runs. However, despite in appearing in over hundred games in both of the next seasons, Burke found himself playing for the Kansas City Blues in the minor leagues. Burke never again played in the majors, finishing his career with the Fort Wayne Champs of the Central League in 1913.\nCoaching.\nFrom 1914 through 1917, Burke was a coach for the Detroit Tigers. He then served as manager for the St. Louis Browns from 1918 through 1920. In 1921, he became a coach for the Boston Red Sox, a position he held for three seasons. Burke later was a coach for the Chicago Cubs from 1926 through 1930, and was last a coach with the New York Yankees from 1931 through 1933."

        "text": "Ice Hockey is an ice hockey video game designed by Alan Miller for the Atari VCS (later renamed the Atari 2600), and published by Activision in 1981. Actor and comedian Phil Hartman starred in the commercial for the game.\nGameplay.\n\"Ice Hockey\" is a game of two-on-two ice hockey. One player on each team is the goalie, and the other plays offensive (although, the goalie is not confined to the goal). As in the real sport, the object of the game is to take control of the puck and shoot it into the opposing goal to score points. When the puck is in player control, it moves left and right along the blade of the hockey stick. The puck can be shot at any of 32 angles, depending on the position of the puck when it's shot.\nHuman players take control of the skater in control of (or closest to) the puck. The puck can be stolen from its holder, shots can also be blocked by the blade of the hockey stick.\nDevelopment.\nPrior to developing \"Ice Hockey\", Alan Miller worked at Atari where he made his first game for the company with \"Surround\" (1977). When he left \"Atari\", he was one of the founding members of Activision where he developed the games \"Checkers\" and \"Tennis\".\nMiller decided to create a hockey game at Activision after watching the sport on television. Miller later said \"I definitely wanted to put the opportunity to knock your opponent down, \"Ice Hockey\" was an improved version of \"Tennis\". I'm actually more proud of it than \"Tennis\".\" \nTo create the game, Miller adapted the missile object, which in most games was a bullet, into the player hockey stick in the programming. Other difficult coding tricks involved having different players have different clothing depending on what team they were on as well as getting four players on the screen than the usual two.\nReception.\n\"Ice Hockey\" was released in 1981.\n\"Ice Hockey\" was favorably reviewed in 1982 by \"Video\" magazine where it was described as \"yet another example of Activision's innovative approach to programmable video-game software\" and suggested that along with \"Championship Soccer\" the game \"proves that cleverly conceived sports simulations can work on the Atari VCS\". Reviewers identified several aspects setting \"Ice Hockey\" apart from other contemporary sports games including the ability of players to take actions that would normally result in penalties (e.g. tripping and slashing), and the fact that the game is playable in both solo and versus modes.\nRichard A. Edwards reviewed \"Ice Hockey\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 54. Edwards commented that \"It's a good game overall, but not a great treatment of ice hockey. Due to the frustrations which can occur and the confusion involved in using two team members, this game straddles the fence on deciding about recommendation. Due to the price, it might be better left alone.\"\nWhen Bill Kunkel reviewed the Atari 8-bit computer game \"Hockey\" by Gamma Software, he wrote, \"Gamma's version misses the level of realism attained in Activision's programmable version for the VCS, by quite a bit.\""

It was programmed by Larry Kaplan who left Atari to co-found Activision the same year. The game is an interpretation of the sport bowling, playable by one or two players.\nGameplay.\nIn all six variations, games last for 10 frames, or turns. At the start of each frame, the current player is given two chances to roll a bowling ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down as many of the ten bowling pins as possible. The bowler (on the left side of the screen) may move up and down his end of the alley to aim before releasing the ball. In four of the game's six variations, the ball can be steered before it hits the pins. Knocking down every pin on the first shot is a \"strike\", while knocking every pin down in both shots is a \"spare\". The player's score is determined by the number of pins knocked down in all 10 frames, as well as the number of strikes and spares acquired.\nOdd-numbered variants are one player games, while two players alternate on frames in even-numbered games.\nDevelopment.\n\"Bowling\" was designed by Larry Kaplan. It was his final game for Atari, Inc. before leaving the company to co-found Activision.\nReception.\n\"Bowling\" was reviewed by \"Video\" magazine in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it was praised as \"an enjoyable version of a sport that is perfectly suited to the video arcade format\". The reviewers singled out the graphics (including the automatic frame-by-frame scoring and \"deft\" character animation) as \"one of the game's best points\".\n\"Bowling\" was added to the \"Atari 50\" (2022) compilation release in 2023."

It has been a wooden bat league since 1993. It is one of almost a dozen leagues in the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. The VBL is funded in part by a grant from Major League Baseball. The Valley League has produced well over 1,000 professional baseball players, including a record 79 former players drafted in the 2008 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft.\nIn 2007, the Valley Baseball League expanded to include one new team with the addition of the Fauquier Gators. Another team was planned to be added in Lexington, Virginia but difficulties with the lighting system delayed the team's addition to the league. The VBL announced in July 2008 that the Rockbridge Rapids would start play in the 2009 season, but the team folded a couple years later. In 2011 the Strasburg Express entered the league and in 2015 the Charlottesville Tom Sox entered the league.\nThe league canceled the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Culpeper Cavaliers joined as the league's 12th team in 2023.\nCurrent teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFormer teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSeason structure.\nThe regular season consists of 44 games played beginning the first week of June and continuing until late July.

Beginning in 2021, teams no longer travel to every other ballpark in a single season: rather, all inter-division meetings were scheduled as a single, 7-inning weekend doubleheader. This format was continued in 2022 but with the home teams reversed.\nIn 2023, the league eliminated divisions and moved to a scheduling model where each team played each other four times for an expanded 44-game schedule, an addition of two games from the previous 42.\nIn 2024, the league again adopted a new scheduling model where teams play games within their respective divisions for the entirety of the season. The league also reverted to a 40-game season with a change of playoff formatting.\nPlayoff format.\nPlayoffs begin immediately following the regular season and continue into early August.

        "text": "The Australia women's national basketball team, nicknamed the Opals after the brightly coloured gemstone common to the country, represents Australia in international basketball. From 1994 onwards, the Opals have been consistently competitive and successful having won nine medals at official FIBA international tournaments (Olympics and World Cups), highlighted by a gold medal winning performance at the 2006 World Championship in Brazil. At the now-defunct regional Oceania Championship for Women, the Opals won 15 titles. In 2017, FIBA combined its Oceanian and Asian zones for official senior competitions; following this change, the Opals compete in the FIBA Women's Asia Cup.\nHistory.\n1950–60s: Beginnings.\nBasketball arrived in Melbourne in 1905, but the first major international women's tournament was the 1953 FIBA World Championships held in Chile. Although the Opals did not qualify for the first tournament, they did, however, qualify for the 1957 Championships held in Brazil. Captained by Lorraine Eiler, the Opals defeated Cuba and Peru. Sixteen year-old Bronte Cockburn led the scoring for Australia with an average of 9.5 points per game, but the inexperienced team ultimately finished in 10th place. Since then, the Opals have helped increase the popularity of the sport in Australia. Australia would not get the opportunity to participate at the 1959 World Championship held in Moscow because at the time, the Australian Government would not allow the team to travel to the USSR. The Opals would not qualify for a World Championship again until the 1967 contest in Czechoslovakia. With an entirely new team and a single victory over Italy, Australia finished in 10th position for the second time. Team captain, Jean Forster, led the scoring for Australia with an average of 21.2 points per game, with a tournament high of 34 against Brazil. Her 21.2 points per game would remain unchallenged for 35 years.\n1970s: Early development.\nIn 1971, the Opals travelled once again to Brazil. Led by new head coach Merv Harris, and featuring Jill Hammond, the team made several improvements with only three players from the 1967 squad selected. Although the Opals finished in ninth place, they had victories over Madagascar (twice), Argentina, Ecuador and Canada. In 1975, the team headed to Colombia with another new head coach, Jim Madigan. Despite a 74–25 confidence building win over Senegal, as well as victories over Japan, Brazil and Hungary, the team finished in 10th place.\nThe 1976 Olympics held in Montreal marked the first Olympic medals awarded for women's basketball, but Opals did not qualify for the tournament. Their next major competition would be the 1979 World Championships in South Korea, which would prove to be their first taste of success. The coach again was Jim Madigan, and the squad featured some of the faces of the Opals for the next decade such as Jenny Cheesman, Robyn Maher, Julie Nykiel, Karin Maar and Patricia Mickan. The team would have early success defeating Italy and France, as well as thrashing Malaysia 119–14. Australia would lose their next three games, but bounced back winning their final game over Japan to finish in fourth place, their best international result to that time.\n1980s: Into the Olympics.\nIn the early days of women's Olympic basketball, only six countries competed in the tournament, and the host country received an automatic entry. Therefore, there were 22 countries competing for the remaining five spots in 1980 Olympics held in Moscow. In the preliminary tournament, the Opals fell to the US and Hungary, and did not qualify for the Olympics. Three years later, the team traveled to Brazil for the 1983 World Championships, looking to demonstrate that their 1979 success was no accident. Despite an early victory over Japan, Australia failed to advance and finished in 11th place. The Opals were not expected to participate at the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles. However, following the decision by Cuba to boycott the games, the door was opened for the Opals to compete in their first ever Olympics. Led by head coach Brendan Flynn, and team captain Jenny Cheesman, the Opals played competitively in every game, but finished fifth out of the six teams.\nThe next tournament for the Opals was the 1986 World Championships in Moscow. The first game against Hungary was a two overtime thriller that the Opals lost 79–77. The game set the tone for the tournament, and despite some close finishes against the top rated teams, Australia finished in ninth place. The Opals then headed into the 1988 Seoul Olympics with a medal hope, but they lost the first game to host nation Korea. The Opals bounced back and defeated Bulgaria, meaning that only the powerful Soviet Union stood between them and a semi-finals berth. In a major upset, the Opals defeated the USSR 60–48, setting up a meeting against Yugoslavia. In a memorable game, the Opals lost a closely contested game at the buzzer 57–56, sending them to a rematch with the USSR for the bronze medal. Motivated by the previous loss, the USSR came out determined and outplayed the Opals 68–53. Despite the loss, the fourth-place finish equalled the Opals’ previous best international placing.\n1990s: Rise as an International force.\nBuilding from their success at Seoul, the Opals headed to Malaysia for the 1990 World Championships with high hopes. The team won their first two games against Malaysia and Italy, before suffering a string of losses to Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. In their final game, the Opals came back from seven-point halftime deficit to beat Bulgaria 73–71 and finish in sixth place. Fifteen teams competed for the five open spots at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and despite a respectable 4–2 record at the preliminary tournament, the Opals did not qualify.\nTwo years later, Australia played host to the 1994 FIBA World Championships. Led by guard Shelley Sandie's 11.9 points per game, the team scored victories over Japan, Italy, Slovakia and Canada to set up a semi-finals match against China. The Opals held an early lead, but China mounted a second half comeback led by Haixia Zheng's 36 points, and Australia just lost by a single point 66–65. In the bronze medal game, Australia played the United States, and despite a small halftime lead, the Opals lost a close game 100–95. The loss however, resulted in a respectable fourth-place finish. The young 1994 team featured the backbone of Australian teams over the next decade; Rachael Sporn, Trisha Fallon, Michelle Brogan, Allison Tranquilli, Sandy Brondello, Annie La Fleur and Jenny Whittle. At the 1994 tournament, the team also adopted the \"Opals\" as its nickname.\nAt the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, the Olympic tournament was expanded to twelve teams, making an easier path for Australia to qualify. Captained by Robyn Maher, the Opals started off with strong wins over South Korea, Zaire, and Cuba before losing to eventual gold medalist United States and Ukraine. Australia then persevered through an overtime game against Russia to set up a semi-finals match against the United States. The US won the game 93–71, sending the Opals to a rematch against Ukraine for the bronze medal. Australia held back a second half comeback by Ukraine to win the game 66–56, earning Australia its first ever international basketball medal for either men or women.\nIn 1998, the Opals looked to build off the bronze medal at the World Championships in Germany. The team featured 17-year-old future star Lauren Jackson, and was led by Michelle Brogan's average of 13.1 points per game. Australia put together a dominant performance, winning their first seven games before losing to Russia 82–76 in a close semi-final match. In the bronze medal game, Carla Boyd's 26 points proved too much for Brazil, and the Opals won 72–67 to earn their second bronze medal in international play.\n2000s: A decade of medals and World Champions.\nWith Sydney hosting the 2000 Olympic Games, the Opals gained automatic entry into the tournament. Captained by Michele Timms, the team started out with dominating performances winning all of their first seven games, sending them to their first ever gold medal match, against the US. The American team proved too strong for the Opals however, as they won 76–54. Australia won the Silver Medal, their best result in international competition at the time. In 2002, the Opals looked to continue their success in China at the World Championships. Coached by Jan Stirling, captained by Kristi Harrower, and powered by Lauren Jackson's 23.1 points per game (which led the tournament), Australia won its first five games all by double figures. In the second round the Opals lost to Brazil, but bounced back with a 78–52 victory over France in the quarterfinal. In the semi-finals, the Opals lost to eventual gold medalist United States, but recovered the next day to capture the bronze medal with a convincing 91–63 win over South Korea.\nAt the 2004 Olympics held in Athens, Greece, the Opals were led by Lauren Jackson's tournament best 22.9 points and 10 rebounds per game. With Penny Taylor contributing with 14.8 points per game, Australia dominated early winning their first seven games, all by double digits. The Opals set up a rematch of the 2000 Olympic gold medal match against the US. The United States outlasted the Opals in the fourth quarter to win 74–63, giving the Opals their second straight Olympic silver medal.\nThe Opals headed to Brazil for the 2006 World Championships looking to win their sixth straight medal in international competitions. Led by Lauren Jackson's 21.3 points per game and Penny Taylor's 18 points per game, first and third best in the tournament respectively, the Opals played their best tournament to date. Australia began the tournament with a forfeit victory over Lithuania. They continued the trend by winning their next seven games decisively, with only one contest being decided by less than 10 points. In the gold medal game against Russia, the Opals led throughout, paced by Penny Taylor's 28 points and Lauren Jackson's 11 rebounds. At the final buzzer, the scoreboard read Australia 91, Russia 74; a convincing victory that delivered Australia's first ever basketball gold medal. Penny Taylor was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Opals looked to reaffirm their title as World Champions. In the lead up, Australia went undefeated against Belarus, Brazil, South Korea, Latvia, Russia, Czech Republic and host China to set up a third straight gold medal match against the United States. The Opals had trouble hitting the basket and shot just 24% en route to a 92–65 defeat. The team earned their third straight Olympic silver medal, and their seventh straight international medal finish. The 2000s was a golden era for the Opals, winning at least a bronze medal at every official FIBA tournament.\n2010s: Ushering a new era.\nIn 2010, the 16th edition of the World Championship was held in the Czech Republic. Pre-tournament favourites Australia, United States, and Russia, dominated play in the first two rounds. In the quarterfinals, however, Australia suffered a shock 79–68 loss to the Czech Republic. The loss meant that the Opals could not finish any higher than 5th place, its worst international result since the early 1990s.\nLooking to rebound from their disappointing 2010 result, the Opals qualified for the 2012 Olympic Games in London by beating New Zealand three games to nil in the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship. They finished the Olympic preliminary series with a 4 – 1 record, losing to France in game 2, but after Belinda Snell sank a well behind the half-court line 3-point shot with less than one second on the clock to send the game into overtime. Against Russia, Liz Cambage became the first woman in Olympic history to successfully slam dunk a basketball. In the quarterfinal against China, Lauren Jackson became the Olympic Games record holder for points scored, overtaking Brazilian legend Janeth Arcain's tally of 535 points. The Opals accounted for China 75–60 to set up a semi-final game with their long-time rivals United States. Despite holding a half-time lead, the Opals again fell short losing 86–73. The Opals would however, win their fifth consecutive Olympic medal with an 83–74 win over Russia to claim the bronze.\nLeading up to the 2014 World Championship in Turkey, a number of long-serving players announced their retirements or declared themselves unavailable. Those players included Kristi Harrower, Jenni Screen, Kristen Veal, Abby Bishop, Kathleen MacLeod, Samantha Richards, Suzy Batkovic and Jenna O'Hea. Three weeks before the start of the tournament, Lauren Jackson withdrew from the team because of a knee injury. Two weeks later Liz Cambage ruptured her achilles tendon during a pre-tournament game and was ruled-out because of the injury. This resulted in the selection of seven debutants into the squad of 12, a move seen as ushering in a new era of Opals basketball. Despite the loss of veteran players, the Opals went through the preliminary rounds and quarter-final undefeated, setting up a semi-final clash with the US. In a hard-fought game, the Opals cut the lead from 16 points to just six early in the final quarter, before losing 82–70. The Opals would however claim their third bronze medal at world championships with a comfortable 74–44 win against host nation Turkey. Penny Taylor was named to the tournament All-Star Five.\nThe Opals qualified for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro following a series win against New Zealand in August 2015. On 31 March 2016, Lauren Jackson announced her retirement from basketball, citing a chronic knee injury as the reason for her decision. The Olympic squad was announced on 12 July 2016 and included seven Olympic debutants and only three players from the 2012 squad. Notable exclusions included three-time Olympic medallist Suzy Batkovic, reigning WNBL MVP Abby Bishop and Rebecca Allen. Despite slow starts which had plagued Australia throughout the tournament, the Opals finished on top of their group with a 5–0 record, outscoring Japan 33–15 in the final quarter to win by six points. In the Quarter-final, the Opals suffered a shock 73–71 loss to Serbia, conceding 26 turnovers and eliminating them from medal contention. This ended a run of five successive Olympic medals dating back 20 years. One highlight was Liz Cambage breaking Lauren Jackson's Australian Olympic record of points scored in a single game with 37 against Japan. It was the third-highest haul by a woman in Olympic history, and the highest in 28 years.\nFollowing the early exit from the Rio Olympics, Brendan Joyce was replaced in April 2017 by former Opals player and Phoenix Mercury head coach, Sandy Brondello. Unlike previous years, the Opals qualified for the 2018 World Cup through the FIBA Women's Asia Cup held in India where they won a silver medal. Kelsey Griffin was named tournament most valuable player. With basketball returning to the Commonwealth Games for the first time since 2006, the Opals easily accounted for England in the final winning the gold-medal game 99–55. At the 2018 World Cup held in Spain, the Opals led their group with a 3–0 record. They then defeated China 83–42 in the quarter-final and Spain 72–66 in the semi-final to set up a gold-medal final with their long-time rivals United States. The Opals lost the game 73–56 with head coach Sandy Brondello stating a lack of offence proved their downfall. Liz Cambage led the tournament scoring with an average of 23.8 points per game and was named to the All-Star Five.\nCompetitive record.\nOlympic Games.\nWomen's basketball was introduced as an Olympic sport at Montreal in 1976. From 1976 to 1992, only six countries (teams) participated in the Olympic tournament. However, in 1996 at Atlanta the tournament was expanded to twelve teams. Through the 2016 Olympics, Australia qualified for the Olympic Games through competing in the FIBA Oceania Basketball Championship held each four years in the year preceding the games. Typically, this tournament featured either a two or three-game series between Australia and New Zealand. With the Oceania Championship having been discontinued after its 2015 edition, and FIBA having removed all women's continental championships except for EuroBasket Women from the Olympic qualification process in 2017, Australia will qualify for future Olympics through a two-stage process, starting with an Olympic pre-qualifying tournament involving Asian and Oceanian national teams in the year before the Olympics and followed by a worldwide Olympic qualifying tournament held in the year of the Games.\nFIBA Women's World Cup.\nThe first official Women's World Cup, known as the Women's World Championship through its 2014 edition, was held in Chile in 1953. The tournament was expanded to 16 countries (teams) in 1990. Since 2017, Australia qualifies for the World Cup through competing in the FIBA Women's Asia Cup, held each four years in the year preceding the Women's World Cup. Before then, Australia qualified through the FIBA Oceania Championship. Typically, this tournament featured either a two or three-game series between Australia and New Zealand. FIBA discontinued the Oceania championships for both women and men after their respective 2015 editions, combining FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania into a single zone for purposes of World Cup and Olympic qualification.\nFIBA Women's Asia Cup.\nCommencing in 2017, teams from Oceania and Asia zones competed together for the first time ever with the top four finishing teams qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Women's Asia Cup.\nInternational caps.\nThe following is a chronological list of Australian players who have played at official senior FIBA international tournaments (Olympic Games and World Cups). The list includes both past and present players. Active players are shown in bold. Where two or more players debuted in the same series, their cap number is determined by their official uniform number (and not alphabetically). As of the 2020 Olympic Games, 112 players have represented Australia at Olympic Games and World Cups.

        "title": "Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio",
        "text": "Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio is the brand name for exclusive play-by-play broadcast presentation of Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio. The coverage has most recently been presented by Indeed, along with AutoZone for the postseason; previous presenting sponsors included Wendy's, Barbasol, Nesquik, DraftKings, Xerox, AutoZone, Excedrin, United States Postal Service and Mercedes-Benz.\nHistory.\nIn 1997, ESPN Radio outbid CBS Radio to become the exclusive national radio broadcaster of Major League Baseball beginning the following year. CBS Radio had been the national radio broadcaster since 1976.\nThe agreement lasted seven years through 2004 and gave ESPN Radio the rights to broadcast numerous games including \"Sunday Night Baseball\", Saturday \"Game of the Week\", Opening Day and holiday games, September weekday pennant race games, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, and all of the playoffs, including the World Series.\nIn 2004, ESPN Radio extended the deal with a five-year, $55 million dollar contract extension through the 2010 season.\nThe agreement also added a weekly program devoted to baseball, which became \"The Baseball Show\" from 3 p.m. ET to 7 pm. ET on Sundays during the regular season. The program was hosted by John Seibel and Steve Phillips.\nCoverage overview.\nAs previously mentioned, in beginning in the 1998 season, ESPN Radio took over from CBS Radio as the official, national radio broadcaster for Major League Baseball. The network's contract with MLB currently runs through 2028, and as of 2022, \"Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio\" is part of ESPN Radio’s main lineup, instead of in an opt-in/opt-out basis as in previous years. However, affiliates retain the ability to opt out of broadcasts involving in-market teams during the regular season.\nThe games include Opening Day, \"Sunday Night Baseball\", Saturday games (usually the same matchup as the Sunday Night game with case-by-case exceptions, mainly due to start time conflicts), holiday games (during Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day; occasionally broadcast as doubleheaders) and September pennant race games. ESPN Radio holds exclusive radio rights to the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby. The postseason (including the Wild Card Games, Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series) is a semi-exclusive arrangement. The participating teams' flagship stations are allowed to air play-by-play using their own announcers and production. The national ESPN Radio feed may, however, be carried live on another station in those markets as well (for instance, WHB in Kansas City aired the ESPN feed of Kansas City Royals postseason games in 2014 and 2015, competing directly with the Royals Radio Network broadcast on KCSP). If affiliate stations on the teams' radio networks wish to carry coverage of postseason games they must use the national feed. Since the inaugural World Baseball Classic in March 2006, the semi-finals and the championship have also been broadcast as part of \"Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio\". The network also broadcast the \"MLB at Field of Dreams\" game in 2021.\nIn addition to affiliate stations on AM/FM radio, ESPN Radio's game broadcasts are carried as part of Sirius XM Radio's MLB coverage (with Sunday night games also being simulcast on MLB Network Radio). However, they are not included in the subscription \"Gameday Audio\" package on MLB.com with the exception of the All-Star Game, for which no other radio play-by-play feed is available.\nSince June 2011, the games can also be heard online at ESPN Radio.com and on mobile devices via the ESPN app and other applications such as TuneIn. They can also be heard on televisions using connected devices (such as video game consoles) via their respective iHeartRadio and TuneIn apps. Previously, rights restrictions prevented ESPN Radio.com from live-streaming the games. Despite MLB not enforcing blackouts for radio coverage, game coverage on the ESPN mobile app and TuneIn are restricted to listeners in the United States and that are located outside the markets of both teams involved in that broadcast, regardless if said teams are home or away.\nBroadcasters.\nAs of 2022, the primary ESPN Radio crew for \"Sunday Night Baseball\" consists of play-by-play announcer Jon Sciambi and color analyst Doug Glanville. In 2010, Sciambi succeeded Gary Thorne, who had called play-by-play in 2008–09; Thorne had succeeded Dan Shulman, did so from 2002 to 2007; Shulman, in turn, had been preceded by Charley Steiner from 1998 to 2002. Glanville succeeded Chris Singleton, who served as analyst from 2011-2021. Singleton, in turn, succeeded Dave Campbell, who was an analyst from 1999 to 2010. Campbell replaced Kevin Kennedy as analyst in 1999, after the latter had worked with Steiner in the network's inaugural season of coverage. Marc Kestecher currently serves as the network's primary \"Baseball Tonight\" studio host, with Jim Basquil or Kevin Winter substituting for him if Kestecher was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts (mainly with his \"NBA on ESPN Radio\" play-by-play duties); he was preceded by Joe D'Ambrosio from 1998 to 2007. \nFor other regular season games (especially Saturday games) as well as select Sunday night games, different play-by-play announcers are used with Glanville remaining as analyst (or, if Ganville is unavailable, a substitute analyst). This is mainly due to Sciambi’s unavailability as he is also the play-by-play announcer for Chicago Cubs games televised on the Marquee Sports Network. Backup play-by-play announcers for \"MLB on ESPN Radio\" included John Schriffen, Karl Ravech, Mike Couzens, and Roxy Bernstein among others.\nSciambi and Glanville also call the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby each year.\nAs of 2018, Dan Shulman called the World Series and one of the two League Championship Series with Singleton each year (Jessica Mendoza joined this crew in 2020, while Eduardo Pérez joined in 2021, in place of Singleton, who was co-hosting the pregame and postgame segments with Kevin Winter), while Sciambi calls the other LCS with Mendoza. Various other announcers work the network's secondary regular-season, Wild Card Game and Division Series broadcasts as needed. Starting in the 2023 season, Sciambi will also call the World Series and a League Championship Series, succeeding Shulman in those roles.\nFor the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sciambi and Singleton called each game working remotely, rather than at the ballpark. For the 2020 postseason, they and all of ESPN Radio's announcers called the games from the ESPN studios in Bristol, Connecticut."

        "title": "2006 World Baseball Classic",
        "text": "The 2006 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was the inaugural tournament between national baseball teams that included players from Major League Baseball. It was held from March 3 to 20 in stadiums in or around Tokyo, Japan and the American cities of San Juan, Puerto Rico; Lake Buena Vista, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Scottsdale, Arizona; Anaheim, California; and San Diego, California.\nThe first two rounds had a round-robin format, which led to two teams being eliminated on run difference tiebreakers: in the first round, Canada was eliminated despite its 2–1 record, due to a blowout loss to Mexico as well as failing to run up the score on South Africa; and in the second round, eventual champion Japan advanced despite its 1–2 record, due to a blowout win over Mexico and losing more narrowly to South Korea than did the United States. The higher-seeded teams generally advanced to the second round, including Puerto Rico and Venezuela, as well as the teams mentioned elsewhere in this summary.\nAlthough South Korea defeated Japan twice in the earlier rounds, they were matched against each other again in the semifinals as the two teams emerging from the same second round pool, and Japan won that game to advance to the final against Cuba (which had defeated the Dominican Republic in the other semifinal). Japan defeated Cuba 10–6 to be crowned the first champion of the World Baseball Classic.\nDaisuke Matsuzaka, a NPB veteran who was little-known outside Japan at the time, was crowned the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. The following year, he made his debut in the Major Leagues with the Boston Red Sox.\nFormat.\nThe first World Baseball Classic featured 16 teams in a round-robin. Each team played the other three teams in their pool once. Teams were ranked by winning percentage in the first round, with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the second round, where the teams from Pools A and B (in Pool 1) and the teams from Pools C and D (in Pool 2) competed against each other in another round-robin.\nTeams were ranked by winning percentage in the second round, without regard to the results of the first round, with the top two teams from each pool entered a four-team single-elimination bracket, with the pool winners and runners-up from each pool facing each other in the semifinals. The winners of the semifinals then met to determine the World Baseball Classic Champions.\nIn the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the home team.\nIn the first two rounds, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nRosters.\nEach participating national federation initially submitted a 45-man provisional roster. Final rosters of 28 players, which also must include a minimum of 13 pitchers and two catchers, were later submitted. If a player on the submitted roster was unable to play, usually due to injury, he could be substituted at any time before the start of the tournament.\nVenues.\nSeven stadiums were used during the tournament:\nPools composition.\nThe teams selected for the inaugural World Baseball Classic were chosen because they were judged to be the \"best baseball-playing nations in the world and provide global representation for the event.\" There was no official qualifying competition. In addition, there were no world rankings by the International Baseball Federation to determine the strength of the countries.\nFinal standings.\nOrganizer WBCI has no interest in the final standings and did not compute. So, it was calculated by IBAF.\nIn the final standings, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nAttendance.\n737,112 (avg. 18,900; pct. 67.1%)\nFirst round.\n326,629 (avg. 13,610; pct. 55.3%)\nSecond round.\n283,880 (avg. 23,657; pct. 74.7%)\nChampionship round.\n126,603 (avg. 42,201; pct. 99.4%)\nAdditional rules.\nThere were several rule changes from normal major league play. Pitchers were held to a pitch count of 65 pitches in the first round, 80 pitches in the second round, and 95 in the championship round. (Netherlands pitcher Shairon Martis used exactly 65 pitches to throw the only no-hitter of the tournament, a 10–0 win over Panama that was stopped by the mercy rule [see below].) If a pitcher reached his maximum pitch count in the middle of an at-bat, he could continue to pitch to that batter, but was required to be replaced once that at-bat ended. A 30–pitch outing needed to be followed by one day off, and a 50–pitch outing by four days off. No one would be allowed to pitch on three consecutive days.\nA mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings in the first two rounds. In addition, ties could be called after fourteen innings of play.\nThe designated hitter rule was in place for all games.\nControversies.\nSouth Korea completed the first two rounds undefeated (6-0) but was still forced to play Japan, a team it had already beaten twice, in the semifinal round. South Korea lost the match and subsequently was placed 3rd, despite the fact that South Korea's final standings were 6-1, with the most wins. Other international sporting competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, are formatted so as to make it impossible for teams to play each other three times. They can only face twice at most – in round robin group play and then again for the championship or 3rd-place match. In addition, the regional grouping of teams was called into question, for the groups were perceived to be unevenly distributed, and the four-team pool system and subsequent three-way tiebreakers were widely seen as awkward.\nTournament organizers were unable to reach an agreement with the MLB umpires' union and so the Classic was overseen by umpires from the minor leagues.\nWhen South Korea beat Japan, they planted South Korean national flags into a pitcher's mound at Angels Stadium at Anaheim.\nThe Chinese Taipei team was originally listed as \"Taiwan\" and bearing the ROC national flag, but following pressure from the People's Republic of China the listing was later changed to Chinese Taipei with the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag.\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency criticized IBAF's drug testing program and threatened to withdraw sanction of the event under claims the MLB was attempting to \"brush the issue under the carpet.\" South Korean pitcher Myung-hwan Park tested positive for a banned substance during the event, and he was subsequently kicked out of the WBC.. Venezuelan pitcher Freddy García tested positive for marijuana.\nNumerous MLB players pulled out of the competition for various reasons, such as Barry Bonds, Vladimir Guerrero, and Manny Ramírez, among others. Cuba in particular barred players such as Orlando Hernández, his half-brother Liván Hernández, and José Contreras from its team as Cubans who had previously defected.\nSuccess of tournament.\nMany members of the United States press were skeptical of the Classic since its inception. The event proved to be quite popular, however, providing many memorable moments including a first round game between Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Attendance was higher than expected at several sites, including the 18,000-seat Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, which was sold out for every Puerto Rico game in the first two rounds. In addition, there were 4,000 media credentials issued — more than the World Series — which bodes well for the stated goal of internationalizing the sport. \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Tom Verducci reported that \"more merchandise was sold in the first round than organizers projected for the entire 17-day event.\" He also reported that, at one point, jerseys for the Venezuelan team were selling at the rate of one every six seconds.\nThe U.S. television ratings on ESPN were stronger than initially expected, drawing in more than one million television sets for some games, more than almost any other ESPN program in the month of March. This occurred despite less than stellar airing times for the games. Most were not aired live but taped, and sometimes with innings cut, as the WBC was organized well after ESPN had committed to much of its programming.\nOutside the U.S. TV ratings were very high. In Latin America, a first-round game between the United States and Mexico, was the third-most-watched game in the history of ESPN Dos, one of the three Spanish-language channels of ESPN in Latin America.\nThe allocation of earnings.\nThe total earnings of the World Baseball Classic is divided into net profit (53%) and prize money (47%)."

        "text": "Since 2010, the NCAA has had a joint contract with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery. The coverage of the tournament is split between CBS, TNT, TBS, and truTV.\nBroadcasters from CBS, TBS, and TNT's sports coverage are shared across all four networks, with CBS' college basketball teams supplemented with TNT's NBA teams, while studio segments take place at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and TNT's studios in Atlanta. In the New York–based studio shows, CBS' Greg Gumbel and Clark Kellogg are joined by Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley of TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" while Seth Davis and Jay Wright of CBS assist with Inside the NBA's Ernie Johnson, as well as Adam Lefkoe and Candace Parker of TNT's Tuesday night NBA coverage. While three of TNT's NBA voices, Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle, and Spero Dedes are already employed by CBS in other capacities, TNT also lends analysts Stan Van Gundy, Jim Jackson, Grant Hill, and Steve Smith, secondary play-by-play man Brian Anderson, and reporters Allie LaForce and Lauren Shehadi, the latter being from TBS's MLB coverage, to CBS. In turn, CBS announcers Brad Nessler, Andrew Catalon, and Tom McCarthy appear on WBD network broadcasts along with analysts Jim Spanarkel, Bill Raftery, Dan Bonner, Steve Lappas, Brendan Haywood, and Avery Johnson, as well as reporters Tracy Wolfson, Evan Washburn, A. J. Ross, and Jon Rothstein, and rules analyst Gene Steratore. Announcers from other networks like Lisa Byington and Robbie Hummel from Fox, the latter also working for Peacock and Big Ten Network, Debbie Antonelli from ESPN, Jamie Erdahl from NFL Network, and Andy Katz from NCAA.com are also lent to CBS and TNT.\nThe current contract runs through 2032 and, for the first time in history, provides for the nationwide broadcast each year of all games of the tournament. All First Four games air on truTV. A featured first- or second-round game in each time \"window\" is broadcast on CBS, while all other games are shown either on TBS, TNT or truTV. The regional semifinals, better known as the Sweet Sixteen, are split between CBS and TBS. CBS had the exclusive rights to the regional finals, also known as the Elite Eight, through 2014. That exclusivity extended to the entire Final Four as well, but after the 2013 tournament Turner Sports elected to exercise a contractual option for 2014 and 2015 giving TBS broadcast rights to the national semifinal matchups. CBS kept its national championship game rights.\nSince 2015, CBS and TBS split coverage of the Elite Eight. Since 2016, CBS and TBS alternate coverage of the Final Four and national championship game, with TBS getting the final two rounds in even-numbered years, and CBS getting the games in odd-numbered years. \"March Madness On Demand\" would remain unchanged, although Turner was allowed to develop their own service."

        "text": "Joshua Green (born November 16, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey center who played most notably in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nGreen was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the second round as the 30th overall pick in 1996. Green was selected from the Western Hockey League, where he was a stand out for the Medicine Hat Tigers, Swift Current Broncos and the Portland Winter Hawks.\nGreen left the WHL during the 1997–98 season, and made his professional debut with the Fredericton Canadiens of the American Hockey League. Josh then made his NHL debut the following 1998–99 season with the Kings before finishing the year with affiliate, the Springfield Falcons.\nAt the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, the Kings traded Green to the New York Islanders along with Olli Jokinen, Mathieu Biron, and a first round selection in 1999 for Žigmund Pálffy, Bryan Smolinski, Marcel Cousineau and a fourth round selection in 1999.\nGreen started the 1999–2000 season with the Lowell Lock Monsters before he was called up to the Islanders, scoring 12 goals in 49 games. Josh was then traded by the Islanders, for the second consecutive year at the Draft, along with Eric Brewer and a second-round selection in the 2000 entry draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík.\nThe 2000–01 season was almost entirely wiped out for Green when he suffered a dislocated shoulder in his second game with Oilers affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. Green recovered to play in 3 playoff games with the Oilers. In the 2001–02 season, Green played his first full season in the NHL appearing in a career-high 61 games.\nIn his third season with the Oilers in 2002-03, Green was traded by the Oilers to the New York Rangers for a conditional pick in 2004 on December 12, 2002. After playing in just 4 games with the Rangers, Green was claimed off waivers by the Washington Capitals on January 15, 2003.\nOn July 17, 2003, Green signed a one-year contract with the Calgary Flames. Green played in 36 games the 2003-04 season with the Flames before he was claimed off of waivers by the New York Rangers on March 6, 2004.\nDuring the NHL lock-out, Green was signed to an AHL contract with the Vancouver Canucks affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Helping guide the Moose to a successful season, Green was signed by the Canucks to a one-year contract on August 23, 2005. Josh was primarily used as an injury reserve forward for the Canucks in the 2005–06 season. Proving he was a solid role player the Canucks, Green was re-signed to a one-year extension where he appeared in 57 games in the 2006–07 season.\nAfter spending the 2007–08 season in Austria with EC Red Bull Salzburg, Green returned to the NHL, signing a one-year deal with the Anaheim Ducks on July 22, 2008. In the 2008–09 season, Green was assigned to Ducks affiliate the Iowa Chops to provide a veteran and scoring presence. Injury limited Green to only 39 games with the Chops. In posting 24 points with the Chops, Green was called up for the Ducks playoff run and appeared in 5 post season games.\nOn July 9, 2009, Green signed a one-year contract with MODO Hockey of the Swedish Elitserien.

        "text": "James Anthony \"Ripper\" Collins (March 30, 1904 – April 15, 1970) was an American professional baseball player, coach and scout. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. A switch hitter who threw left-handed, Collins was listed as tall and weighed , during his playing days. Despite his stature, he was a power hitter who in co-led the National League (NL) with 35 home runs (HR).\nThe nickname \"Ripper\" developed during an on-field incident that occurred when Jimmy was a young player. A ball rocketed off his bat and struck a nail protruding from the outfield fence; it caused the cover to partially tear. When asked who hit the ball, the retrieving outfielder saw the ball hanging and said, \"It was the ripper.\"\nBaseball career.\nBorn in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Collins grew up in nearby Nanty Glo, where he was a standout in sandlot baseball, in his youth. He started his Minor League Baseball (MiLB) career in 1923, playing in various leagues for eight seasons. Then, in 1930, Collins hit .376 with 40 HR for the Rochester Red Wings of the International League (IL). His 180 runs batted in (RBI) set an IL record.\nFor that performance, Collins was called up to the big league St. Louis Cardinals, in 1931. As a member of the Gashouse Gang Cardinals teams, Collins had a breakout season in 1934 with 35 homers (sharing the league's long-ball championship with future Baseball Hall of Famer Mel Ott), 128 RBI, and a .333 batting average (BA). That year, he also hit .367 in the World Series, which the Cardinals won in seven games.\nCollins is the only first baseman to have twice recorded no putouts in a nine-inning game – once for the 1935 Cardinals and again for the 1937 Chicago Cubs. Between his time with the Cubs and the Pirates, Collins spent two years with the Los Angeles Angels, playing in 346 games, during that time.\nIn 1,084 games played, Collins compiled a .296 BA (1,121 for 3,784), with 615 runs scored, 135 HR, and 659 RBI with 205 doubles, 65 triples and 356 bases on balls. His on-base percentage (OBP) was .360, with a .492 slugging percentage (SLG). Collins hit better than .300 four times in a nine-year major league career. In 13 World Series games, he batted .277 (13 for 47). Defensively, Collins recorded a .991 regular season fielding percentage.\nCollins played in the Pacific Coast League and Eastern League, after his big league career was over. In 1944, he was named Minor League Player of the Year as the player-manager of the Albany Senators of the Eastern League. That season — at the age of 40 — Collins hit .396 with a league-leading 40 doubles.\nCollins returned to the major leagues as a member of the Cubs' College of Coaches from 1961–63, and was a scout for the Cardinals at the time of his death (in 1970, at age 66)."

        "title": "2006 World Baseball Classic championship",
        "text": "The 2006 World Baseball Classic championship was the inaugural final of the World Baseball Classic played on March 20, 2006, at Petco Park in San Diego, United States. The best-of-one final was the match to determine the first world champion in baseball. Although this was the first iteration of the World Baseball Classic, both Cuba and Japan were favorites to win the championship, as they were the only countries to have appeared in the top four at every iteration in the Summer Olympics up to this final. Japan won by 4 runs to claim the first championship of the World Baseball Classic.\nBoth countries had to go through two rounds of group stages and the semi-finals in knockout format to reach the final. Cuba lost only two games, once to Puerto Rico in the first round and once to the Dominican Republic in the second round. However, Japan lost three times, twice to South Korea in each round and the United States in the second round. This sparked a format controversy since South Korea would have a better overall and head-to-head record than Japan by the end of the tournament. As such, Cuba was the favorite to win the final as the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team.\nThe match began progressing when Japan's starting pitcher–Daisuke Matsuzaka–gave up four hits, five strikeouts and one run by the end of the 4th inning through a gyroball pitching style. Offensively, Japan was able to record 6 runs with the help of Ichiro Suzuki's batting style of contact hitting. Once the Japanese bullpen took the mound in the 6th inning, Cuba aggressively responded for the rest of the baseball game through power hitting. By the end of the eighth, the disparity would come down to one run in favor of Japan from Frederich Cepeda's home run, who would record three runs batted in by the end of the game. In the ninth, Japan would counter by pushing their offensive limit over Cuba's, which would result in a final score of ten to six. The aftermath of the final most notably included notice from Major League Baseball, from Cuba's increase in defection to Matsuzaka's impact for the World Series champion Boston Red Sox in the next year.\nBackground.\nFormat.\nThe 2006 World Baseball Classic was the first World Baseball Classic, organized jointly by the International Baseball Federation and Major League Baseball. The competition took place from March 3, 2006, to March 20, 2006, which marks a duration of 18 days. A unique approach to hosting in comparison to global governing bodies of sports such as FIFA, FIBA, and ICC, is that multiple countries can host at each stage in the competition. For this year, Japan, Puerto Rico, and the United States were granted hosting rights, although at different levels. There was no qualification required, and all teams were invited based on merit.\nThe structure of the tournament required two rounds of round-robin groups and a knockout stage beginning in the semi-finals. The round-robin groups would have the top two teams from each pool to advance to the next round. Outside of determining the home and away team, the next round would not be dependent of the previous one. A total of 39 matches were played in front of over 737,000 people combined. No adjustments were made from the original baseball rules, although teams have to face each other less in comparison to regional competitions like the World Series in North America.\nRosters.\nJapan would announce their roster, consisting of twenty-eight competitors from the Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and two competitors from Major League Baseball in North America. The two representatives from MLB would consist of pitcher Akinori Otsuka from the Texas Rangers and outfielder Ichiro Suzuki from the Seattle Mariners. As for Cuba, all thirty Cubans in their roster came from the Cuban National Series, the professional league only played in Cuba. This is primarily due to the Cuban government having restricted rules for outside work not related to Cuba. If violated, the Cuban government would ban the individuals who broke the rules of working outside the country. Due to these reasons, only 2 MLB representatives were competing in the final, even though tens of MLB players were in different rosters.\nRoad to the championship.\nRound one.\nJapan was drawn into Group A of the first round, and was granted the right to host for this stage. The group featured the strongest teams in East Asia: China, Chinese Taipei, and South Korea. Japan was able to defeat China and Chinese Taipei with ease, outscoring 32 to 5 runs combined. However, Japan would suffer their first loss of the tournament to South Korea, with a slow slump from a 2–0 lead to lose the match 3 runs to 2. As a result, South Korea and Japan advanced to the second round as first and second place finishers in Group A respectively.\nCuba was drawn into Group C of the first round, with fellow Caribbean rival Puerto Rico as host. The group consisted of Panama from Central America along with the Netherlands from Europe–both widely regarded as the best in their respective regions–and the aforementioned Caribbean nations. Cuba had a slightly tougher time in their group, with a 2 run win against Panama and a 9 run rout in favor of Puerto Rico. However, the group did no resort to tiebreakers. As such, Puerto Rico and Cuba advanced to the second round as first and second place finishers in Group C respectively. \nOther countries who advanced from the first round were the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela.\nRound two.\nJapan and South Korea met with the top two finishers of Group B: Mexico and the United States (the host of this pool). Although Japan comfortably defeated Mexico by five runs, the Japanese would struggle against the United States and South Korea at this stage. The match against the United States sparked a controversy regarding a sacrifice fly appeal. The game was highly competitive with consistent back-and-forth leads up to the eighth where the controversy occurred. When Tsuyoshi Nishioka was on third base, he ran to the home plate once the sacrifice fly was hit from Akinori Iwamura. Initially, Japan scored another run to make the score four to three. However, the call was overturned because Nishioka ran earlier than allowed. This led to the United States defeating Japan from Alex Rodriguez's run batted in at the bottom of the ninth. In addition, Japan would lose to South Korea–who would sweep the group–by one run again. Japan, Mexico, and the United States would finish at 1–2 in Pool 1. However, Japan would be declared as the second place finishers due to their amount of runs scored by their opponents and innings pitched.\nGroup 2 was much less complex, although a tiebreaker was still used. Cuba and Puerto Rico met with the first and second place finishers of Group D: the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. The Cubans would edge host Puerto Rico by 1 run and comfortably defeat Venezuela by 5 runs. However, Cuba would lose to the Dominican Republic by four runs, which would cost them in the tiebreaker. Due to the Dominican Republic losing to Puerto Rico, who would lose to Venezuela, these results would lead to a head-to-head tiebreaker. Since the Dominican Republic and Cuba both finished with two wins and one loss while the other countries did not, they would both advance to the semi-finals. However, since Cuba lost to the Dominican Republic, the Cubans would finish in second place as well in Pool 2.\nSemifinals.\nThe United States was granted the right to host the 2006 World Baseball Classic semifinals and finals, although the Americans did not advance to this level. The stadium that would hold the semifinals and finals is Petco Park in San Diego, home to the San Diego Padres. As a rule in the World Baseball Classic, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If both teams hold a similar winning percentage, a coin flip would occur to determine the home and away team. By this rule, this favored South Korea the most as they had an undefeated record up to this point.\nThe first semifinal was played on March 18, 2006, at 12:00 p.m. PT that featured the 2nd-seed Dominican Republic and 3rd-seed Cuba. The match was met with frequent hitting from both teams that relied on a power hitting playstyle. Both countries scored a combined total of 20 hits. However, in terms of runs the match was scored in specific innings from both sides, due to the pitching battle and clutch defenses. The Dominican Republic would score one run in the sixth inning, and Cuba would respond with three runs in the seventh inning immediately. This would become the final score, and Cuba would advance to the championship.\nThe second semifinal was played on March 18, 2006, at 7:00 p.m. PT that consisted of undefeated 1st-seed South Korea and 4th-seed Japan. The match would be instrumental in their sports rivalry, as the winner of this match would reach the final and outplace the loser. Japan would avenge South Korea by overwhelming Korean batting in seven scoreless innings led by pitcher Koji Uehara. However, Japan would offensively struggle up to the 7th inning until Kosuke Fukudome rapidly paced the offense to score five runs in the seventh through his home run. Japan would end up scoring another run in the eighth, and securing a win against South Korea six runs to none. Once the game concluded, a format controversy would be brought up to light as South Korea would finish with the better overall and head-to-head record by the end of the tournament. The impact of this controversy was changing the format in the next edition, as double-elimination would replace round-robin in the first and second round.\nWind-up.\nNews organizations had mixed predictions on who would win the final. On one hand, Japan had more experience in professional baseball, particularly from Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball whereas Cuba would consider themselves amateurs. On the other, Japan came into the knockouts as a fourth-seed and Cuba has more experience in international baseball, winning 25 of the 39 Baseball World Cups (the former premier global competition in baseball). In addition, first baseman Albert Pujols argued that most of the Cubans could compete in the MLB if they were rightfully given the opportunity to. On top of this, both were the only countries to make top four at all editions in the Summer Olympics, although Cuba would have three gold medals and one silver medal whereas Japan would have two bronze medals and one silver medal up to this point. However, Japan holds a 4–3 record to the final, while Cuba has a 5–2 record. Therefore, by the rules of the World Baseball Classic, Inc., WBCI would declare Cuba as the favorites to win the match due to their overall record in the tournament up to the final.\nChampionship.\nSummary.\nThe final was played on March 20, 2006, at Petco Park in San Diego. This was the third game played at the park in the tournament, after the semi-finals where Japan beat South Korea and Cuba beat the Dominican Republic. The championship was played in front of nearly 43,000 people and began at 3:40 p.m. Pacific Time. Petco Park is widely known for being a pitcher's park, due to the high number of strikeouts and intentional walks likely coming from the marine layer and wind speed. On this day, the temperature recorded as with 10 mph in a windy setting. Umpires consisted of Americans Tom Hallion (HP), Bob Davidson (1B), Ed Hickox (2B), Chris Guiccione (RF), Australian Neil Poulton (LF), and Puerto Rican Carlos Rey (3B).\nJapan changed their starting pitcher to Daisuke Matsuzaka–one of the pioneers of the Gyroball and owns a diverse arsenal–from Koji Uehara, who earned the win against South Korea. The park effects of Petco Park would prove to be favorable for Matsuzaka and would in turn make Cuba have a hard time batting due to their power batting style. Within the first four innings, Matsuzaka recorded five strikeouts to give the opportunity for the Japanese offense to largen their lead. In the fifth, Ichiro Suzuki hit a double to add two more runs, finishing the first half of the game with a six to one lead. Matsuzaka would exit the game right after this moment, and Cuba would respond aggressively offensively.\nA single-base hit made by Yuli Gurriel initiated Cuba's comeback, although Gurriel made the first base through an error by the Japanese defense. Soon after in the sixth inning, Ariel Borrero made first base through an earned hit and Osmani Urrutia would bat in both Gurriel and Borreo to make Japan's lead cut from five to three runs. The seventh inning served as a quiet pitching battle between both teams. However, in the bottom of the eighth inning, Frederich Cepeda would make a home run with a batter on base to cut the disparity to one run in favor of Japan.\nJapan would plan a hitting sequence in order to outplay Cuba offensively, as Japan specialized on contact hitting. The Japanese's performance of their fundamentals would show the most from Ichiro Suzuki, who would hit to the very right field and bat in Munenori Kawasaki to make the game seven to five runs. Japan would get on-base frequently throughout the inning, to the extent that the top of the ninth inning would end in ten to five runs. The offense would overwhelm the Cuban offense, as they were only able to score one more run in the bottom, finalizing Japan as the champion with ten to six runs as the score. Matsuzaka would be declared as the most valuable player of the tournament for setting the tone in the beginning of the game, particularly from intimidating the Cuban offense for four innings."

        "title": "Kenneth Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Kenneth Earl Davis (born April 16, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the TCU Horned Frogs and was selected in the second round of the 1986 NFL Draft. He played in the NFL for the Green Bay Packers (1986–1988) and the Buffalo Bills (1989–1994).\nCollege career.\nBefore his NFL career, Davis played for Texas Christian University from 1982–1985. As a junior, he rushed for 1,611 yards (#3 in the NCAA) and 16 touchdowns, earning him a first-team selection on the College Football All-America Team. He also had the 5th most votes of all candidates for the Heisman Trophy that year. His 1,611 rushing yards were a school record, and remained so until LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for 1,850 yards in 1999.\nHe missed all but the first game of his senior season when he was suspended (along with six teammates) after confessing he received cash payments from boosters, but he finished his college career with an impressive 2,904 yards and 24 touchdowns. He left TCU second in school history in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.\nNFL career.\nConsidered a potential first-round draft pick in the 1986 NFL Draft by Mel Kiper and Gil Brandt, Davis decided to join the NFL one year early after his suspension from TCU. However, he was denied as he had already played one game that year; under the \"Red Grange Rule\", players are not allowed to play college and NFL football in the same year. In an attempt to force the NFL to allow a special supplemental draft, Davis and agent Michael Trope prepared to sue the league for $13 million; Trope pointed to Florida State running back Roosevelt Snipes, who was kicked off the FSU roster before the 1985 season and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the supplemental draft, as an exception to the rule.\nNFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle rejected Davis again and the league filed a counter-suit to ensure the Grange Rule was legal. Davis accepted the ruling and tried to drop the case, but attorney Steven Knowles filed the suit anyway, unaware of Davis' decision. After the matter was cleared, Davis waited until 1986 to enter the league, and he was selected by the Packers in the second round of the 1986 NFL Draft.\nAs a rookie, he was the team's leading rusher with 519 yards, returned 12 kickoffs for 231 yards, and caught 21 passes for 142 yards. In 1987, he was their leading rusher again, although he only rushed for 413 yards. Davis played only 9 games with the Packers in 1988 due to injuries, and signed with the Bills after the season ended.\nWith the Bills, Davis proved to be a superb complement to star running back Thurman Thomas, and a great asset to the team overall. In 1990, he rushed for 302 yards on just 64 carries (a 4.7 yards per carry average), caught 9 passes for 78 yards, and scored 5 touchdowns, assisting his team to Super Bowl XXV, where they lost to the New York Giants. In the game, Davis rushed for 4 yards and caught 2 passes for 23 yards. The following season, he rushed for 624 yards, caught 20 passes for 118 yards, returned 4 kickoffs for 73 yards, and assisted Buffalo to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. They lost Super Bowl XXVI to the Washington Redskins 37–24, but Davis had a good performance, leading the team with 17 rushing yards and catching 4 passes for 38 yards. He would get the start in that game, because star running back Thurman Thomas could not find his helmet.\nIn 1992, Davis had the best season of his career. He rushed for 613 yards, caught 15 passes for 80 yards, returned 14 kickoffs for 251 yards, and scored a career-high 6 touchdowns. But he is best remembered for his superb performance in the post season. In Buffalo's wild card game against the Houston Oilers, Thomas was knocked out of the game early with a hip injury, and Houston built up a 28–3 first half lead. Then, they increased it to 35–3 early in the third quarter when backup quarterback Frank Reich's pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. But in what became known as The Comeback, Buffalo stormed back and won the game 41–38 in overtime; the rally from the 32-point deficit was the largest comeback in NFL history. Davis was instrumental in the Bills victory, rushing for 68 yards, catching 2 passes for 25 yards, and scoring the first touchdown of the game for Buffalo. One week later, the Bills traveled on the road to face the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Playoffs, with Thomas back but playing hurt, Davis did a superb job carrying the offense, rushing for 104 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries in the Bills 24–3 win. Then the Bills advanced to their 3rd consecutive Super Bowl by defeating the Miami Dolphins 29–10 in the AFC title game. Thomas had recovered enough to regain his spot on the starting lineup, but Davis was still a major factor in Buffalo's victory. He rushed for 61 yards and a touchdown while also catching 4 passes for 52 yards. The Bills lost Super Bowl XXVII 52–17, but Davis had a great game. He was the Bills leading rusher with 86 yards, while also catching 3 passes for 16 yards and returning a kickoff for 21 yards.\nDavis was major contributor for Buffalo for the 1993 season as the team advanced to their 4th consecutive Super Bowl. He rushed for 391 yards, caught 21 passes for 95 yards, and gained 100 yards on kickoff returns. After his team lost Super Bowl XXVIII to the Dallas Cowboys 30–13, he spent one more season with Buffalo and then retired in 1995.\nDavis finished his 9 NFL seasons with 823 carries for 3,513 rushing yards (4.3 yards per carry), 135 receptions for 878 yards, 42 kickoff returns for 707 yards, and 32 touchdowns (27 rushing and 5 receiving). He now is the Athletic Director and former head football coach at Bishop Dunne Catholic School in Dallas, Texas."

        "title": "Civil Service Cricket Club",
        "text": "Civil Service Cricket Club (CSCC) is one of Ireland's oldest cricket clubs. Formed in 1863 in Dublin's Phoenix Park, the club currently has over 40 members and competes in league and cup competitions arranged by the Leinster Cricket Union.\nThe club's first games were played on the lawn of the Viceregal Lodge (Now Áras an Uachtaráin) in 1863, the same year that the club had its ground donated to it – the ground it still uses today.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1860s, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland decided that his civil servants needed some quality rest and recreation. He sponsored a Bill through Parliament, granting civil servants a cricket ground in Phoenix Park, beside the Dog Pond, where the Civil Service Cricket Club plays to this day. The club played its first match on the front lawn of the Viceregal Lodge in April 1863.\nBack in its early days, the club had trouble fielding sides, or to be more precise, fielding sides punctually. In those days the Civil Service worked on Saturday mornings, and as most matches were played on that day, starting at noon, the club was almost always a late starter. This situation gradually improved as office managers in Dublin Castle and the Custom House developed a blind eye on match days.\nThe club built a wooden pavilion with a bar in its basement, and attracted visiting sides from all parts of Ireland. Charles Stewart Parnell brought a Wicklow side to Civil Service in the 1870s. Club membership was opened to civil servants’ families and James Penny, the son of a civil servant, was the club's first international. The club produced several Irish international cricketers like George Christian and Paddy Murphy.\nCivil Service was at its peak just before the First World War but things were changing, with the Gaelic Athletic Association establishing its dominance. After the Second World War, Civil Service reverted to its junior status and it has since prospered to varying degree. Now, the club's membership includes Australians, Indians, Pakistanis and South Africans. The Civil Service link lives on – club president Fintan Butler, is based in the Office of Public Works and his son Owen, who started his career in Civil Service, later went on to play for Ireland. Aidan Kinsella, who was the captain of the club's second team, is also based in the Office of Public Works.\nTeams.\nCurrently Civil Service Cricket club has four teams that compete as follows:\nDocumentary.\nOn 5 July 2006, RTE broadcast a documentary on Civil Service Cricket Club "

        "title": "Kuwait national cricket team",
        "text": " \nThe Kuwait national cricket team is the team that represents Kuwait in international cricket. The team is organised by Cricket Kuwait, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2005, having previously been an affiliate member since 1998. Kuwait made its international debut in 1979, but has only played regularly at international level since the early 2000s, appearing regularly in Asian Cricket Council tournaments since then. Beginning in the early 2010s, the side appeared in several World Cricket League events, although it was relegated back to regional level after the 2013 Division Six tournament.\nHistory.\nThe Kuwait Cricket Association was formed in 1996 and they became an affiliate member of the ICC two years later.\n21st century.\n2000 - 2017.\nThey participated in the ACC Trophy for the first time in 2000, but couldn't progress beyond the first round, a performance they repeated in the 2002 tournament.\nIn 2004, Kuwait pulled off a series off upsets to finish in third place in that year's ACC Trophy, only just missing out on qualification for the 2005 ICC Trophy. They did qualify for the repêchage tournament in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in which they finished sixth after losing to the Cayman Islands in a play-off.\nIn February 2006, Kuwait finished third out of five teams when they hosted the ACC Middle East Cup. In August, they took part in the ACC Trophy, but were unable to reproduce their strong 2004 performance. They were eliminated in the first round when a tie with Hong Kong left them in third place in their group on run rate. A win in this match would have seen them through to the quarter finals.\nIn 2007 Kuwait played in the ACC Twenty20 Cup, which they also hosted. They finished third in the tournament, beating the UAE by three runs in a play-off.\nKuwait has participated in several World Cricket League tournaments, hosting and winning Division Eight in 2010; winning Division Seven in Botswana in May 2011; and coming third in Division Six in Malaysia in September 2011. Kuwait set one of the lowest ever T20 targets during the 2014 Asian Games.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Kuwait and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nKuwait made its Twenty20 International debut on 20 January 2019, defeating Maldives by eight wickets in the 2019 ACC Western Region T20 at Al Emarat Cricket Stadium, Muscat, Oman.\nIn 2018 former South African international Herschelle Gibbs was appointed coach of Kuwait for the 2020 ICC World Twenty20 qualification process.\nSquad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Kuwait in 12 months or has been part of the latest One-day or T20I squad.\n\"Updated as of 2 November 2023.\"\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Kuwait\n\"Last updated 17 April 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Kuwait\nMost T20I wickets for Kuwait\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2574.

        "title": "USC Trojans baseball",
        "text": "The USC Trojans baseball program represents the University of Southern California in college baseball. Established in 1888, the team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Pac-12 Conference. USC’s home field is Dedeaux Field, which is named in honor of former head coach and National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Rod Dedeaux.\nThe USC Trojans are one of the most successful programs in the history of college baseball. The Trojans have won more baseball national championships than any other program across all divisions of college baseball. With 12 national championships, USC is far and away the leader in that category; no other Division I school has more than seven. As of June 14, 2021, USC also ranked fifth in all-time College World Series (CWS) appearances with 21, trailing only Texas (37), Miami (FL) (25), Florida State (23), and Arizona State (22). The Trojans have won more individual CWS games (74) than any program but Texas (85). USC also ranks fourth in all-time NCAA tournament wins with 173—trailing only Texas (245), Florida State (199), and Miami (194)—and 10th in total NCAA tournament appearances with 37.\nThe Trojans have compiled an all-time record of 2,944–1,745–29 ()—ranking sixth in all-time wins and 22nd in all-time win percentage—and have captured outright or tied for 38 conference championships, as of the end of the 2021 season. USC's most notable baseball coach was Rod Dedeaux, who coached from 1942 to 1986 and led the school to 11 of its NCAA championships, including five straight from 1970 to 1974. The first Trojan national championship came in 1948. The 12th and most recent NCAA championship came in 1998.\nHistory.\nThe early years.\nThe Trojans began recognizing baseball as a school sport in 1889. As with many programs during the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Trojans lacked a consistent head coach, when they even had one at all. It was not until 1908 that the Trojans had an official head coach, Harvey Holmes, but Holmes only coached the team for one year. Holmes also coached other sports at USC including football and track. The team would get another coach during the 1911 season, Curtiss Bernard. Bernard also only coached for a year, and in 1912 the Trojans once again had a one-year coach in Len Burrell.\nDuring the World War I years, the USC baseball team was made up mostly of law school students, but the team opened up to all students for the 1916 and 1917 seasons. Following the conclusion of the war, the baseball team was coached by \"Gloomy Gus\" Henderson in 1920 (who would also coach the Trojan basketball team for two years and the football team for six). Henderson would join forces with Willis Hunter as co-coaches for the 1921 season, but the team was left without a coach for the 1922 season. In 1923 the team was coached by George Wheeler, who also coached the law students during the 1914 season. Wheeler coached the team for a year, and would mark the last time the Trojan baseball team has lacked consistency at the coaching position.\nSam Crawford era.\nLong-time Major League Baseball player and multiple MLB record-holder Sam Crawford took over as head coach of USC baseball in 1924. Crawford would mark the end of inconsistency at the coaching ranks for the baseball program. During his tenure, the program slowly began to rise to national prominence, and Crawford helped to create the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association (CIBA) in 1927. Crawford coached the Trojans for six years before turning the reigns over to Sam Barry. Crawford compiled an overall record of 59-46-3, including a second-place finish during the initial campaign for the CIBA.\nSam Barry era.\nIn 1930, Sam Barry took over the USC baseball program and immediately built off of the success his predecessor had. On his arrival at USC in 1929, he was named head basketball coach and was made an assistant for the USC football team under his friend and colleague, Howard Jones. When Jones died suddenly in 1941, Barry was named his successor, and served as head coach for all three major USC sports teams simultaneously. Barry won the CIBA title in his first year, finishing 11–2 and 25–5–1 overall. During the next decade, Barry would claim four more CIBA titles. Barry coached the Trojans from 1930–1941 before joining the Navy during World War II. As he left, he recommended that Jeff Cravath become the head football coach, Julie Bescos become the head basketball coach, and Rod Dedeaux, the captain of his 1935 team, become the head baseball coach. Upon his return, Barry would resume coaching the Trojans alongside Dedeaux. Barry finished with a career mark of 219–89–3. He remains one of only three coaches to coach a Final Four game and in a College World Series. Barry was elected to the inaugural class of the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1966.\nBarry-Dedeaux years.\nWhen Sam Barry returned from World War II in 1946, Barry and Dedeaux served as co-coaches, with Dedeaux running the team each year until Barry finished the basketball season. The arrangement was so successful that USC won the College World Series in 1948.\n1948 National Championship.\nAfter finishing the season 40–12–1, USC met Yale for the 1948 NCAA Division I baseball championship at the second College World Series. The CWS in 1948 was a best 2-out-of-3 format. The games were played on June 25 and June 26, with June 26 being a doubleheader if necessary. USC won the first game, 3–1 to take a 1–0 series lead, but lost game 2 by a score of 8–3. The third and final game immediately followed game 2. USC scored a run in the first inning to claim a lead it would not surrender. USC claimed their first national championship with a game 3 victory, 9–2. Although USC won, they were unable to prevent future President of the United States of America, George Bush, from collecting a double in the final game.\nRod Dedeaux era.\nAfter being co-head coach in 1942 with his former college coach Sam Barry, Dedeaux took over the USC program in 1943. Barry recommended Dedeaux to coach the team when Sam Barry joined the Navy. Dedeaux coached the Trojans by himself for the next three years, until once again joining forces with Barry as co-head coaches. After Barry's death in September 1950, Dedeaux became the sole coach of USC baseball.\nAfter taking over in 1951, Dedeaux became the sole coach and proceeded to build on the early success to establish the strongest program in collegiate baseball. The Trojans claimed 11 straight CIBA championships in Dedeaux's first 11 years. The Trojans claimed nine outright titles and tied for first in 1953 and 1957. Following the 1957 campaign, Dedeaux's team finished the season 36–8 overall and earned the first of his 10 national championships as sole coach.\nRetirement and legacy.\nAfter a total of 45 years as head coach of USC, Dedeaux decided to retire following the 1986 campaign. Dedeaux drastically changed college baseball and left historic marks on the sport that might never be touched. Dedeaux won a total of 11 national championships, 10 by himself and one with Sam Barry, compiled a record of 1,332–571–11, and completed a stretch of 37 years without a losing season. He retired as the winningest coach in college baseball history and held that distinction until 1994 when Texas head coach Cliff Gustafson broke it.\nWhile he was at USC, Dedeaux also served as coach of the United States national baseball team at both the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with baseball being a demonstration sport prior to its elevation to full medal status in 1988.\nFollowing his retirement, Dedeaux became the Director of Baseball for USC, and for the rest of his life remained a beloved annual presence at the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The field the Trojans currently play their games at is named after him. He was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1970, and in 1999 was named the Coach of the Century by \"Collegiate Baseball\" magazine.\nDedeaux died at age 91 in Glendale, California, of complications from a December 2, 2005, stroke. He was survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Helen Jones, and their four children. On July 4, 2006, Dedeaux was inducted as a member of the first class of inductees into the College Baseball Hall of Fame.\nPost Rod Dedeaux.\nMike Gillespie.\nUSC reached out to Mike Gillespie, one of Rod Dedeaux's former players, to replace the recently retired coach. Gillespie played under Dedeaux from 1960–1962, and after a successful coaching stint at the College of the Canyons, he was named just the fourth head coach of USC baseball since 1924.\n1998 National Championship.\nGillespie was named National Coach of the Year in 1998.\nRetirement and legacy.\nAfter 20 years as the head coach of the Trojans, Gillespie decided to retire following the 2006 season. During his career, Gillespie kept Trojan baseball in the spotlight, especially in the years leading up to and following the 1998 championship. He finished with an overall record of 763–471–2 during his tenure as coach of the Trojans. As a result of his success, Gillespie earned the honor to coach the 2000 USA National Team. During his tenure he was named Pac-10 coach of the year four times, while his teams produced 44 All-America selections, 94 draft picks, and 25 Major League players.\nAfter sitting out the 2007 season, Gillespie was named coach of the UC Irvine Anteaters in September 2007. Gillespie replaced Dave Serrano, who had just guided the Anteaters to their first CWS appearance but left to take over at Cal State Fullerton, his alma mater, after George Horton left Fullerton to head the new program at Oregon.\nChad Kreuter.\nIn June 2006, Chad Kreuter became only the fifth man to earn the title of head baseball coach at USC since 1924. Kreuter replaced his father-in-law, Mike Gillespie, after Gillespie retired.\nKreuter failed to reach the postseason in each of his four years as head coach. He produced an overall record of 111–117 during this time, never posting a winning record. During his tenure, the Trojans twice finished in last place in the Pac-10, and never higher than fifth in the conference. Although his players flourished in the classroom, he came under heavy criticism late in his tenure. He was relieved of his duties in August 2010 and replaced by assistant coach and former Loyola Marymount head coach Frank Cruz.\n2010s.\nOn May 30, 2019, Dan Hubbs was informed that his contract would not be renewed by the university.\nOn June 14, 2019, former Loyola Marymount head coach Jason Gill was hired to be the head coach for the Trojans.\nJason Gill.\nOn June 14, 2019, Former Loyola Marymount head coach Jason Gill was hired to be the new head coach of the USC Trojans baseball program.\nBallparks.\nBovard Field.\nBovard Field was the former home of USC baseball until Dedeaux Field opened in 1974.\nThe baseball field was aligned (home to center field) similar to Dedeaux Field, but a few degrees clockwise, nearly true north, but just slightly west. Home plate was located in today's E.F. Hutton Park and left field was bounded by Watt Way. Beyond first base, a large eucalyptus tree came into play; while its trunk was in foul territory, some of its branches crossed into fair territory and guarded the foul line in shallow right field.\nDedeaux Field.\nDedeaux Field is the home field for the USC Trojans baseball team. It is named after the former legendary USC coach Rod Dedeaux, who coached from 1942 to 1986. The Trojans moved into the ballpark in 1974, the same year that they won their fifth consecutive national championship. After many renovations, the current capacity is 2,500 people.\nYear-by-Year Results.\n\"Through the end of the 2021 season.\"\n\"Final Rankings are from Collegiate Baseball Division I Final Polls (1959–2006)\"\nPlayer awards.\nAll-Americans.\nThe following is a listing of first team selections.

        "text": "The USC Trojans men's basketball program is a college basketball team that competes in the Pac-12 Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, representing the University of Southern California. Following the end of the 2023-2024 academic calendar, Pac-12 schools Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington will be joining the Big 10 conference. \nThe Trojans' most recent head coach was Andy Enfield, who left on April 1, 2024. Eric Musselman is the current head coach of the USC program.\nHistory.\nThe USC Trojans are 1,500–1,097 (.578) all-time in intercollegiate basketball games. They boast 25 All-Americans, 14 league\nchampionships, one conference tournament title, 16 NCAA tournament appearances, five Sweet Sixteen appearances, four Elite Eight appearances, and two Final Four appearances. Sam Barry and four of his USC players (Jack Gardner, Alex Hannum, Tex Winter and Bill Sharman) have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches. (Sharman was also inducted as a player.)\nThe early years (1906–28).\nOn December 6, 1907 the Los Angeles Herald declared: \"Basketball Is Started At U.S.C.\" The first official game of USC basketball was an interclass drubbing by the freshman over the sophomores, 25–2. USC would later host its debut intercollegiate basketball game, the first of its kind in Southern California, on January 16, 1907 with an 18–15 win over Occidental College.\nAfter a standout season in 1910, when USC placed second in the league, the Methodists (as they had been known at the time) slowly grew the program under the direction of a series of player-managers and part-time coaches. Several football headmen served as basketball coaches during that time, including Ralph Glaze, Dean Cromwell, Elmer \"Gloomy Gus\" Henderson, and Leo Calland. In addition, USC's basketball team was often littered with football standouts such as USC Athletic Hall of Famers Morley Drury and Jess Mortensen.\nIn 1922 USC joined the Pacific Coast Conference. The Trojans then won their first conference title in 1928 under Calland's leadership, edging past the Washington Huskies in the second and final game of the conference championship series. With a see-sawing score for most of the game, Charley Bone buried two shots in the last minute to secure the 27–26 victory and begin a new era of achievement for USC basketball.\nThe Sam Barry era (1929–50).\nWhen football assistant and basketball head coach Leo Calland left USC in the summer of 1929 to become the football head coach and athletic director of the University of Idaho, legendary USC football coach Howard Jones found himself in need of a new assistant and the university in need of a new basketball head coach. Jones recommended Sam Barry, one of his former assistants at the University of Iowa who had also coached Hawkeye basketball for seven years. Barry agreed to follow Jones west, once more joining his football staff while also taking control of the basketball program.\nBuilding a national power (1929–41).\nBarry brought with him an aggressive style of play uncommon outside the Midwest. His strategic innovations would lay the groundwork for the Triangle offense and his campaign to do away with the center jump after each basket would change the game forever. \"It is rumored that other conference coaches are eyeing the Trojans with no little anxiety,\" the Daily Trojan mused in the lead up to Barry's first season. The Trojans finished the 1929–30 season with an overall record of 15–5. USC defeated the Washington Huskies in three games to win the PCC championship for the second time in school history. Guard Johnny Lehners and center Jess Mortensen received All-America honors at the end of the season, becoming the first two All-Americans in program history.\nProducing three more All-Americans (Jerry Nemer, Lee Guttero [2-time], Eddie Oram), USC dominated the PCC South Division for much of the 1930s, with five straight division titles from 1932 to 1936 and a title in 1939. In 1935 the Trojans also won the conference title with a victory over Oregon State in Corvallis. After falling to the Beavers in the first game of the series, USC won the second to tie the series. USC won the third contest by a score of 32–31, with All-Southern Division forward Ernie Holbrook making the game-winning shot in the final seconds of the game.\nUSC won its ninth division title in 12 years in the 1939–40 season after defeating Oregon State in two games at the Shrine Auditorium. Led by All-American Ralph Vaughn, USC received its first invitation to the eight-team NCAA tournament and was considered a favorite to challenge for the national title. The Trojans defeated Colorado, 38–32, in the first round to face Phog Allen's Kansas in the semi-finals. Senior Keith Lambert gave the Trojans the lead with less than a minute remaining in the game, but Howard Engleman scored with 16 seconds remaining to give Kansas the 43–42 win.\nWorld War II and the coaching carousel (1942–45).\nIn January 1942, Barry, then-head coach of the three major sports at USC, enlisted in the Navy as a lieutenant commander and was appointed athletic director for the Navy's western V-5 physical training school in St. Marys, Georgia. Assistant coach Julie Bescos assumed head-coaching responsibilities in Barry's absence, finishing the season until he too left for service in the Navy later in 1942. Jack Hupp, two-time All-Southern Division forward for USC in 1935 and 1936, was then named head coach in October, but in November he joined the Air Force. Ernie Holbrook, Hupp's former teammate and star of the 1935 PCC champion team, then became head coach after the first game of the season and led the Trojans to a 23–5 record and their tenth PCC South Division title in the 1943–44 season. Gene Rock and Ted Gossard were named All-Americans. The following year, however, Holbrook was called to service in the Army, becoming the fourth USC basketball coach to leave for military service in two years.\nBobby Muth, a former teammate of both Hupp and Holbrook, was chosen to be the newest replacement head coach. Muth struggled to match the performance of his predecessor, with no returning players from 1943's division-winning team due to the war. In his first year as head coach, he managed a disappointing 8–12 record, USC's first losing record in 11 years.\nJulie Bescos returned to USC after the war's end in 1945 as an assistant football coach, having earned a Silver Star for overseeing the rescue and evacuation of wounded sailors as a flight deck officer on the kamikaze-damaged USS Saratoga. He was posthumously inducted into the USC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\nFormer player and coach Ernie Holbrook died during combat in Europe. As a private in the 28th \"Keystone\" Infantry Division, Holbrook was killed during the early stages of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. Each year, the Ernie Holbrook Memorial Award is given in his memory to the team's most inspirational basketball player.\nSam Barry returns (1945–50).\nWith the surrender of the Japanese in August 1945, Sam Barry was discharged from the Navy, receiving a Naval Commendation for his work in the physical and military training of Navy personnel in the South Pacific. He then returned to his pre-war post as head basketball coach. Barry never managed to truly to regain his pre-war success, however. Before the war, Barry compiled a win–loss record of 208–95, winning 68% of his games. In games after the war, his winning percentage fell to 58%, with an overall record of 68–49. Despite this decline in performance, Barry's teams still finished second in the division in all but one season during the final five years of his career.\nBarry's 1949–50 USC team produced another All-American in Bill Sharman. On September 23, 1950, while scouting for football at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, Barry suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 57. He remains USC's all-time winningest coach, with an overall record of 260–138. In his 17 years as head coach, his teams won eight division titles and three conference titles, and featured eight All-Americans. His 40 consecutive wins over crosstown rival UCLA stand as the longest winning streak by any coach against a single opponent in the history of college basketball.\nThe Forrest Twogood era (1951–66).\nIn the wake of Sam Barry's sudden death in September 1950, USC turned to assistant coach Forrest Twogood, who had previously been the head coach at the University of Idaho and the University of San Francisco. Mr Twogood had worked as an assistant to Barry, coaching the Trojan freshmen, and had played for Barry at the University of Iowa.\nThe Final Four (1954).\nTwo weeks before the 1953–54 season's end and in third place in the PCC, USC won two games against then-second-place California. The Trojans' next and final conference series of the regular season came against the first-place UCLA Bruins. Coming into the series, John Wooden's Bruins—winners of four division titles in five years—were on a 13-game win streak, had not been defeated at home all season, had not lost both games of a series at home in six years, and needed just one win in two games to secure the division title.\nUSC's third team All-America center, Roy Irvin, scored 29 points in the first game in leading the Trojans past the Bruins, 79–68. In the second contest, another strong performance from Irvin saw the Trojans with the lead late in the game, until UCLA tied the score in the final minute. Trojan substitute Chet Carr made a 10-foot jump-shot in the waning seconds, securing the win and the Trojans' first outright division championship in 11 years.\nUSC faced the Oregon State Beavers and their 7-foot, 3-inch center, Wade Halbrook in the PCC Championship series to determine which team would represent the PCC in the NCAA Tournament. In the opening game of the series, the Trojans contained Halbrook and came away with a 65–47 victory. In the second game, Halbrook scored 12 points and stifled the USC offense with his rebounding and defense. The Beavers outscored the Trojans 20–6 in the final ten minutes of the first half, and despite a third-quarter comeback attempt, USC was defeated for the first time in six games.\nThe final game was a close affair throughout. Halbrook and Irvin led their teams' efforts in the final minutes, trading baskets and the lead until Irvin's hook shot gave the Trojans the lead for good with under a minute remaining. Two free throws from captain Dick Welsh with 27 seconds remaining secured the 48–45 win for USC.\nUSC advanced to the 16-team NCAA Tournament and began tournament play in Corvallis, where the Trojans defeated Idaho State in the first round, 73–59. In the second-round game, the Trojans faced the Santa Clara Broncos, a team that had played in three consecutive NCAA Tournaments. The game was closely contested throughout, with 13 lead changes and eight ties. The third quarter saw a forward surge from the Trojans, which the Broncos matched as the quarter closed. Santa Clara entered the final 40 seconds of a low-scoring fourth quarter with a three-point lead. USC's Irvin was fouled as he scored on a lay-in, and his made free throw tied the game at 57–57. The score remained tied at the end of the regulation period. In the final minute of the overtime period, the Trojans again trailed by three points. Welsh scored to bring the Trojans within one point of Santa Clara. Guard Tony Psaltis then tied the score at 65–65 with a free throw, forcing a second overtime period.\nA single point—coming on a free throw from USC's Welsh during the first 30 seconds of the second five-minute overtime period—provided the winning margin for the Trojans. In the same year the NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock, Santa Clara held the ball to stall the game for four minutes and seven seconds. With 17 seconds remaining, the Broncos' Ken Sears attempted to drive to the basket. Several Trojans surrounded him and forced a turnover. Time expired and the Trojans advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City.\nUSC faced the Bradley Braves in the Final Four game. The Trojans maintained a lead for most of the contest, but Bradley mounted a comeback in the fourth quarter. Holding a one-point lead with one minute remaining, the Trojans were without leading scorer Roy Irvin, who had fouled out of the game. Bradley scored five unanswered points in the final minute to take a 74–70 lead, securing the win. USC's Jack Dunne scored with six seconds remaining, but the score was not sufficient to erase the Trojans' deficit. USC fell to Penn State in the national third-place game, 70–61, after the Trojans' late comeback attempt, begun as they trailed by 20 points, fell short.\nThe USC student-run newspaper, the Daily Trojan, reflected on the season:\nThe Bob Boyd era (1967–79).\nIn a 13-year career as head coach of the USC basketball team his teams went 216–131 overall and played in the post-season four times (the 1979 NCAA playoffs, 1973 NIT and 1974 and 1975 Commissioner's Conference tourney). His 1971 team, which went 24–2 and was ranked fifth in the nation (USC was ranked first at midseason), is regarded among USC's best (he also won 24 games in 1974). His wins over UCLA in 1969 and 1970 were the UCLA's first losses in Pauley Pavilion, built in 1966. He was twice named the conference Coach of the Year. He sent ten players into the NBA, including Paul Westphal and Gus Williams.\nMorrison and Raveling (1980–94).\nIn seven seasons at USC, Stan Morrison had a record of 103–95 and finished first in the Pac-10 in 1985. George Raveling took over the program in 1987, leading the Trojans to two NCAA tournament appearances. He compiled a 115–118 overall record in eight seasons.\nThe Henry Bibby era (1995–2005).\nIn 1995, Former UCLA great Henry Bibby was named head coach of USC men's basketball. In ten seasons, Bibby had an overall won-loss record of 131–111 at USC. He led his 1997, 2001 and 2002 teams to the NCAA tournament, including an \"Elite Eight\" appearance in 2001, but was fired after four games into his final season.\nRecent success.\nUSC advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, led by future NBA players Nick Young, Taj Gibson, and Gabe Pruitt, with Tim Floyd as their head coach. This was the first time since 2001, and the second time since 1961. This team defeated Kevin Durant and the Texas Longhorns before facing Tyler Hansbrough and the UNC Tar Heels in the Sweet Sixteen. USC had built a sizable lead in the first half against UNC before multiple questionable foul calls against Taj Gibson forced USC to sit Taj Gibson for an extended period of time in the second half, whereby the Tar Heels were able to take the lead and win the game.\n2007–08.\nIn the 2007–08 season, USC featured guard O. J. Mayo from Huntington High School. He had been ranked by several major sports publications as the top prospect of the 2007 recruiting class. During the 2007–2008 season, the Trojans played the Kansas Jayhawks and the Oklahoma Sooners at home. They also played in the Anaheim Classic from November 22–25, 2007. Each night, USC played a team from the Big Ten, Big East, SEC, and Big 12. Additionally, they had a return game against the South Carolina Gamecocks in Columbia, South Carolina. After the regular season and Pac-10 Tournament had ended, USC earned a #6 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Trojans were seeded against the #11 seed Kansas State Wildcats. This first-round game gained heavy media attention because of the matchup between college phenoms O. J. Mayo and Michael Beasley. Although the game was relatively close throughout the first half and early second half, the Wildcats came away with the victory by a score of 80–67. As expected by many, Mayo entered the NBA draft at the end of the 2007–08 season. He was selected as the 3rd overall lottery pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Trojans finished the 2007–08 season with a record of 21–12. However, on January 3, 2010, the University concluded its internal investigation over allegations that Mayo received improper benefits during his stay at USC in 2007–08. The University concluded that Mayo did receive improper benefits and that head coach Tim Floyd was an active participant in ensuring that Mayo continued to receive money and gifts on behalf of a sports agent, in violation of NCAA rules. Therefore, USC declared Mayo ineligible to play in 2007–08, and USC Basketball has voluntarily vacated all regular season wins from the 2007–08 season. The USC record for 2007–08 thus is 0–12, a result of the peculiar scoring rules for marking vacated wins as no contests.\n2008–09.\nThe 2008–09 Trojans team featured the 3rd-ranked recruit in the nation according to Rivals.com, All-American forward DeMar DeRozan. USC also received a commitment from point guard Percy Romeo Miller, Jr aka Lil Romeo, the son of Master P. The team opted not to have an October 17, 2008 Midnight Madness celebration.\nBuilding upon the success of previous years, the Trojans defeated Arizona State in the Pac-10 Championship Game and clinched their third straight NCAA Tournament appearance. They defeated Boston College to reach the second round, where they lost 74–69 to eventual runner-up Michigan State.\nSanctions.\nOn January 3, 2010, USC announced that it had implemented self-imposed sanctions for violations of NCAA rules related to Mayo. The sanctions include a one-year ban on postseason competition following the 2009–2010 regular season, a reduction of one scholarship for the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 academic years, and reductions in the numbers of recruiting days and coaches participating in off-campus recruiting through 2011. The school also vacated all wins earned during the 2007–2008 season, due to Mayo's ineligibility at that time.\nAndy Enfield and return to prominence (2013–present).\nAfter becoming the first head coach to lead a 15-seed to the Sweet 16, guiding his Florida Gulf Coast Eagles to upsets of Georgetown and San Diego State, Andy Enfield was hired as the new head coach at USC on April 1, 2013. Enfield replaces interim coach Bob Cantu, who substituted for fired coach Kevin O'Neill, terminated after a 7–10 start to the Trojans' season. The Trojans had finished the season 14–18 and had missed the NCAA Tournament the previous two years.\nEnfield's first two assistant hires were Tony Bland from SDSU with a reported contract of $300,000 per year, and Jason Hart from Pepperdine University. Both have strong reputations as recruiters.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors announced bribery, soliciting a bribe and wire fraud charges against assistant coach Tony Bland.\nOn February 4, 2024, Enfield was replaced by Eric Musselman, who departed from being the head basketball coach for the University of Arkansas.\nFacilities.\nThe stage of Shrine Auditorium served as home court for USC basketball for much of the 1940s. However, the nature of hosting a basketball game in a theater meant that visibility was limited except in the center section of the audience. \"If you had a seat on the extreme right or left, you missed seeing one basket,\" said Alex Omalev, a Trojan forward from 1940 to 1943. The score was kept by two men seated on an elevated platform and a gun blast marked the end of each half. \nBeginning in 1949 the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax District hosted USC basketball until 1959 at which point the Trojans moved into the nearby Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where they would remain for close to the next 50 years.\nUSC had talked about building an on-campus arena for the better part of a century and that dream finally came to fruition when Louis Galen, successful banker and long-time Trojan fan, donated a total $50 million to ensure the facility was built. They broke ground in 2004 and the Galen Center officially opened its doors in 2006, becoming the new home of USC basketball.\nThe facility is 255,000 square feet (23,700 m2), with a 45,000 square foot (4,200 m2) pavilion, and has three practice courts and offices. The seating capacity is 10,258, and there are 22 private suites. Total construction cost was an estimated $147 million.\nThe first men's basketball game was held on November 16, 2006 against the University of South Carolina. The first sellout crowd was the men's basketball game against the UCLA Bruins on January 12, 2007 with an attendance of 9,682. On January 31, 2008 the USC men's basketball game against the Arizona Wildcats set the arena's attendance record with a crowd of 10,258 in attendance. That record has been matched four times since: February 17, 2008 vs UCLA; January 11, 2009 vs UCLA; January 9, 2011 vs UCLA, and February 13, 2022 vs. UCLA (which also saw the largest student section to date).\nCoaches.\nThe following are the USC men's head basketball coaches who have led the Trojans against conference competition. Prior to fielding conference teams, USC men's basketball was also coached by notable USC coaches such as Dean Cromwell who was a track and field and baseball coach as well as Elmer \"Gloomy Gus\" Henderson who also coached baseball and football at USC.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in twenty NCAA Tournaments (with one appearance vacated), including two Final Four appearances. USC's combined record is 17–21* (17–20).\n\"*\" 2008 tournament appearance and loss to Kansas State were vacated due to NCAA penalty. The revised record is 12–17 all-time.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 3–5.\nCCA/NCIT results.\nThe Trojans appeared in both the 1974 CAA Tournament and the 1975 NCIT Tournament. Their combined record was 2–2.\nAll-time record vs. former Pac-12 opponents.\nThe USC Trojans lead the all-time series vs. three of the former Pac-12 opponents. They trail the series vs. five opponents.\nRecord vs. Big Ten Opponents.\nAll-time series includes non-conference matchups.\nUpdated April 4, 2024\nRetired numbers.\nThe Trojans have retired seven jersey numbers."

        "title": "2007 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2007 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 17, 2007 and concluded on April 3 at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. The Final Four consisted of Tennessee, LSU, Rutgers, and North Carolina, with Tennessee defeating Rutgers 59–46 for their seventh National Title. Tennessee's Candace Parker was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nThe Dallas Regional largely followed the seeding, with the top two seeds meeting in the regional final, and the top seed, North Carolina, winning 84–72 to move on to the Final Four, the second consecutive trip to the Final Four for the Tarheels. In the Dayton Regional, seventh-seeded Mississippi upset second-seeded Maryland, and followed that with an upset of third-seeded Oklahoma, but in the regional final faced top-seeded Tennessee, who went on to beat Mississippi by 36 points, and move on to the Final Four. This is last time Mississippi upset a top seed a feat not repeated until 2023 when 8 seeded Ole Miss upset number 1 seeded Stanford in the second round but losing to Louisville in the third round.\nIn the Fresno Regional, the second-seeded Stanford Cardinal fell to Florida State, who then lost to third-seeded LSU. This is last time Stanford got eliminated in the second round until 2023. The wins by Florida State over ODU and Stanford were vacated by the NCAA. In the regional final, LSU easily beat Connecticut, 73–50. This was the last Final Four to not feature Connecticut until 2023. In the Greensboro Regional, neither of the top two seeds made it to the regional final. The top seed, Duke, lost a one-point game to Rutgers, while the second seed, Vanderbilt, was ousted in the second round by Bowling Green. Fourth-seeded Rutgers beat the third seed, Arizona State, by 19 points in the regional final.\nThe semifinal game between Tennessee and North Carolina was expected to be a high-scoring game, but it turned out to be more disorder than scoring, In a game the \"New York Times\" would describe as an \"artless grind\", the Tarheels held a 48–36 lead with just over eight minutes to play. They would not score another basket. The Lady Vols, who ended up hitting only 27% of the field goal attempts, went on a 20–2 run, and ended up with the win, 56–50.\nIn the other semifinal, Rutgers faced LSU. Rutgers's appearance in a Final Four game seemed improbable earlier in the season, when the Scarlet Knights lost four of their first six games, and played so poorly that their coach C. Vivian Stringer revoked their access to their locker room. However, their play, particularly their defense, improved, and they were now a game away from a possible appearance in a national championship game, if they could defeat LSU, who had Sylvia Fowles as a dominant center. Fowles, who would go on to be the second overall WNBA draft pick the following year, had just completed a double-double against Connecticut, scoring 23 points, snaring 15 rebounds and blocking 6 shots. Rutgers held her to five points while missing eight of her ten field goal attempts. Rutgers pulled out to a 37–19 lead at halftime, and went on to win, holding LSU to 35 points, an NCAA record low in a Final Four game.\nIn the championship game, Tennessee was too much for Rutgers. The Lady Vols had an eleven-point lead at halftime, which Rutgers cut to seven, but that was as close as they would get. Candace Parker scored 17 points, but Pat Summitt noted the contribution of their 5-foot 2-inch point guard Shannon Bobbitt, who hit two key three-pointers en route to scoring 13 points of her own. Tennessee won 59–46, bringing the seventh national championship to the school, and increasing the win total of Summitt to 947, which is 33 more than Bob Knight, the most victorious coach on the men's side.\nSubregionals.\nOnce again, the system was the same as the Division I men's basketball tournament, with the exception that only 64 teams go and there is no play-in game. Automatic bids are secured by 31 conference champions and 33 at-large bids.\nThe subregionals, which once again used the \"pod system\", keeping most teams at or close to the home cities, were held from March 17 to 20 at these locations:\nRegionals.\nThe regionals were held from March 24 to 27 in the following regions. The regionals, as they were in the previous two tournaments, were named after the city they were played in.\nThe regional winners advanced to the Final Four, held on April 1 and 3, 2007 at Quicken Loans Arena, in Cleveland, Ohio, hosted by both Cleveland State University and the Mid-American Conference.\nQualifying teams - automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 2007 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-one conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 2007 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams - at-large.\nThirty-three additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In twenty-one cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-three additional at-large teams were selected from ten of the conferences.\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty-one states, plus Washington, D.C. Texas, Tennessee, and North Carolina had the most teams with five bids each. Nineteen states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nData source\n&lt;br&gt;(*) – Number of asterisks denotes number of overtimes.\nFinal Four – Quicken Loans Arena, Cleveland, Ohio.\n\"Regional Initials: DAL-Dallas; DAY-Dayton; FRE-Fresno; GRE-Greensboro.\"\nTelevision and radio.\nAs it had every year since 2003, ESPN and ESPN2 televised all 63 games. The first two rounds were presented on a regional basis. In some cases, a complete game of interest to a particular region were shown. However, most of the telecasts were in a \"whip-around\" format, with the specific game being shown changed on occasion and the endings to all close games or potential major upsets included.\n All games not shown on either ESPN or ESPN2 in a local market area were available to subscribers of ESPN Full Court, a pay-per-view package available on most major cable and satellite providers. Select games were also simulcast on ESPNU and ESPN360.\nAll games from the regional semifinals forward were televised nationally on either ESPN or ESPN2, in both standard-definition and high-definition formats. The Final Four was on ESPN. In addition, the championship game was presented in the ESPN Full Circle format.\nESPN had three announcers at each site: a play-by-play announcer, a color commentator, and a sideline reporter. (In contrast, CBS Sports, which covers nearly every game of the men's tournament, did not use sideline reporters until the Final Four.) Mike Patrick, Doris Burke, Holly Rowe and Mark Jones had those respective roles at the Final Four site in Cleveland. Patrick, Burke and Rowe also covered the Greensboro regional.\nBurke, who had been a sideline reporter at previous Final Fours, replaced Ann Meyers, who had that role for the last ten years. Meyers is now the general manager of the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA.\nOther regional broadcast teams were:\nSome of the other ESPN commentators during earlier rounds included Linda Cohn, Dave Revsine, Dave Barnett, Fran Fraschilla, and Van Chancellor.\nTrey Wingo was the studio host, with analysts Kara Lawson and Stacey Dales.\nMowins and Debbie Antonelli called the Final Four action on Westwood One radio.\nRecord by conference.\nEighteen conferences went 0-1: America East, Atlantic Sun Conference, Big Sky Conference, Big South Conference, Big West Conference, Conference USA, Ivy League, Mid-Continent, MEAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Northeast Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, SWAC, West Coast Conference, and WAC"

        "text": "Charles Wade Wilson (February 1, 1959 – February 1, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, Dallas Cowboys, and Oakland Raiders in a seventeen-year NFL career from 1981 to 1998. He was quarterbacks coach for the Dallas Cowboys from 2000 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2017, and also for the Chicago Bears from 2004 to 2006.

The Eagles held a 23–0 advantage with 8:23 minutes to play. Wilson directed 3 scoring drives, after being benched at halftime in favor of rookie 3rd-string quarterback Steve Bono, but after Bono only completed one pass out of ten, Wilson was put back in the game with less than 12 minutes remaining, throwing 3 touchdown passes to achieve a 28–23 victory.\nIn 1986, he appeared in 9 games, including 3 starts in place of an injured Kramer.

In his own defense, Wilson said that the drug HGH was used to help his problem with diabetes. However, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell seemed to sidestep this defense, saying, \"First of all, I'm not going to get into the personal situations of why Wade was taking it, but that's not an accurate point.\" In 2016, he had the second toe on his right foot amputated because of an infection caused by complications from his diabetes condition.\nThe Cowboys decided to part ways with Wilson following the 2017 season.\nPersonal life.\nWilson died due to complications from Type 1 Diabetes, a disease he had for almost 30 years, at his home in Coppell, Texas on his 60th birthday."

        "title": "Hazard (golf)",
        "text": "A hazard is an area of a golf course in the sport of golf which provides a difficult obstacle, which may be of two types: (1) water hazards such as lakes and rivers; and (2) man-made hazards such as bunkers. The governing body for the game of golf outside the US and Canada, The R&amp;A, say that \"A \"hazard\" is any bunker or water hazard\". Special rules apply to play balls that fall in a hazard. For example, a player may not touch the ground with their club before playing a ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf govern exactly from where the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers (or sand traps) are shallow pits filled with sand and generally incorporating a raised lip or barrier, from which the ball is more difficult to play than from grass.\nBunker.\nA bunker is a depression, commonly near the green or fairway, that is usually filled with sand. Playing the ball from a bunker is considered more difficult than from closely mown grass, and to do so proficiently requires a high degree of skill. A specialized club called a \"sand wedge\" is designed for extracting the ball from a bunker. Specific rules of golf govern play from a bunker. For example, a player may not ground their club in a bunker; that is, the club cannot touch the ground before the swing.\nAccording to the etiquette of the game, the player (or their caddie) is expected to smooth the area of the sand disturbed, normally using a rake, in order that conditions are similar for all subsequent players.\nTypes of bunkers.\nThere are three types of bunkers used in golf course architecture and all are designed to be impediments to the golfer's progress toward the green. Fairway bunkers are designed primarily to gather up wayward tee shots on par 4 and par 5 holes; they are located to the sides of the fairway or even in the middle of the fairway. Greenside bunkers are designed to collect wayward approach shots on long holes and tee shots on par 3 holes; they are located near and around the green. Waste bunkers are natural sandy areas, usually very large and often found on links courses; they are not considered hazards according to the rules of golf, and so, unlike in fairway or greenside bunkers, golfers are permitted to ground a club lightly in, or remove loose impediments from, the area around the ball.\nWater hazard.\nWater hazards, like bunkers, are natural obstacles designed to add both beauty and difficulty to a golf course. Water hazards are typically either streams or ponds, situated between the teeing ground and the hole.\nTypes of water hazards.\nTwo types of water hazards exist: \"lateral\" water hazards (marked with red stakes around the perimeter of the hazard) and water hazards (marked with yellow stakes). Lateral hazards are usually adjacent to the fairway being played (along the side), while water hazards generally cross the fairway being played forcing the player to hit over the water hazard."

        "title": "2006 Women's Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup (officially IRB Rugby World Cup 2006 Canada) took place in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The tournament began on 31 August and ended on 17 September 2006. The 2006 tournament was the third World Cup approved by the IRB, the previous two being held 2002 in Spain and in the Netherlands, in 1998. The Black Ferns of New Zealand won the 2006 World Cup, defeating England in the final, as they had in 2002. It was New Zealand's third successive title.\nThe semi-finals were also direct repeats of the 2002 tournament – in fact five of the top six places in the final rankings were unchanged. Elsewhere the USA advanced from 7th in 2002 to 5th, and Ireland climbed from 14th to 8th while Australia (5th to 7th), Spain (8th to 9th), and Samoa (9th to 10th) slipped down.\nThe period prior to the competition had not been without controversy. The decision to award the hosting of the competition to Canada ahead of a strong bid from England surprised many.\nIn addition – apart from in Asia – there were no qualifying tournaments for the 2006 World Cup. Instead teams were invited to take part by the IRB with selection based on performances at the World Cup in 2002 and in international matches between 2002 and 2005. This resulted in accusations of a lack of clarity in regard to some selection decisions. In particular the awarding of the final place in the tournament to Samoa instead of Wales (following a poor performance by Wales in the 2005 Six Nations) was the cause of some controversy and comment prior to the event.\nTickets and sponsorship.\nTickets had been available since July 2006 and they could be purchased online at Ticketmaster or by phone. There were individual and student tickets (for each of six match days), tickets for youth teams and clubs, corporate packages and a special \"World Cup Pack\" of $125 allowing access to all matches including the finals.&lt;br&gt;The partners of this tournament were Toyota \"Never Quit\" Awards Program, Molson, Tait Radio Communications, Glentel, Budget, University of Alberta, Edmonton Airports and Clubfit.\nThe event was covered by English language network Global TV, daily newspaper Edmonton Journal and radio stations CFRN 1260, CFBR 100.3 and CFMG 104.9.&lt;br&gt;All matches were filmed and for the first time were available via streamed media. The final was also broadcast live on TV in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, and a one-hour TV highlights programme was produced by IMG for wider distribution, while these recordings are held as part of the IRB's World Cup archive.\nMatch officials.\nOn July 6, 2006 the IRB Referee Selection Committee announced the appointment of match officials, with twelve women officials selected for the tournament consisting of eight referees and four touch judges. This panel was assisted by experienced international referees George Ayoub, Lyndon Bray, Malcolm Changleng and Simon McDowell, who were appointed in April. Other three touch judges from Canada Rugby Union were included in the final list.\nFormat.\nThe competition was contested over 18 days between 12 teams, allocated to four pools of three and structured into two parts:\nPool stage.\nThe first three match days saw a cross-pool league system in operation, with Pool A playing Pool D and Pool B playing Pool C, with points going towards one single division table for all four pools.\nClassification within each pool was based on the following scoring system:\nBonus points were awarded for teams scoring 4 tries or more and losing by 7 points or less. No extra time were played.&lt;br&gt;\nTeams were ranked 1–12 on the basis of the most match points. If two teams were equal on match points for any position, then the following criteria would be used in this order until one of the teams could be determined as the higher ranked:\nKnockout stage.\nAfter three match days, with each team having played three pool matches, positional semifinals were played with the top four-positioned sides vying to make the Women's Rugby World Cup final and all other sides playing matches in the final two rounds to decide tournament rankings.\nIf no winner could be determined within the time allowed, two teams should have played an extra time of 10 minutes each way with an interval of 5 and then eventually a kicking competition."

Sometime the players statistics are divided by minutes played and multiplied by 48 minutes (had he played the entire game), denoted by * per 48 min. or *48M.\nA player who makes double digits in a game in any two of the PTS, REB, AST, STL, and BLK statistics is said to make a double double; in three statistics, a triple double; in four statistics, a quadruple double. A quadruple double is extremely rare (and has only occurred four times in the NBA). There is also a 5x5, when a player records at least a 5 in each of the 5 statistics.\nThe NBA also posts to the statistics section of its Web site a simple composite efficiency statistic, denoted EFF and derived by the formula, ((Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks) − ((Field Goals Attempted − Field Goals Made) + (Free Throws Attempted − Free Throws Made) + Turnovers)). While conveniently distilling most of a player's key statistics in one numerical score, the formula is not highly regarded by the statistics community, with the alternative Player Efficiency Rating developed by ESPN basketball statistician John Hollinger being more widely used to compare the overall efficiency of players.\nTempo-free statistics.\nExamples of tempo-free statistics including the following\nFantasy leagues.\nIn fantasy basketball, statistics are used in a formula as the measurement of a player's performance."

He was selected to one Pro Bowl in 1969 as a member of the Atlanta Falcons. Berry was a member of three Super Bowl teams with the Minnesota Vikings in the mid-1970s.\nCollege career.\nBorn and raised in San Jose, California, Berry played football at Willow Glen High School, where his father was a longtime head coach. He graduated in 1960 and played college football at Oregon, where he was a three-year letter winner under head coach Len Casanova. At Oregon, Berry teamed with future Pro Football Hall of Famers Mel Renfro and Dave Wilcox and led the Ducks to three consecutive winning seasons. In his junior year in 1963, Oregon's last as an independent, the Ducks beat SMU 21–14 in the Sun Bowl on New Year's Eve. (The Pacific-8 conference did not allow a second bowl team until 1975).\nBerry was named a first-team All-American after his senior season, despite being edged out as All-Pacific-8 quarterback by Craig Morton of California. In the balloting for the Heisman Trophy won by John Huarte of Notre Dame, Berry was thirteenth, just behind Joe Namath (Alabama) and Gale Sayers (Kansas). His teammates named him the outstanding player and he played in the East-West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl.\nIn 1985, Berry received the university's distinguished alumnus award. Berry was inducted to the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1987 and the University of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nSelected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the eleventh round of the 1964 NFL Draft and by the Denver Broncos in the twenty-sixth round of the 1964 AFL Draft, Berry played his senior season at Oregon in 1964 and signed with the Minnesota Vikings in late November. Minnesota had acquired his draft rights in an off-season trade with the Eagles. Berry was out of college during the 1961 season, a de facto redshirt year.\nBerry played three seasons with the Vikings, the first two under head coach Norm Van Brocklin, a former Oregon quarterback, and was primarily a reserve behind Fran Tarkenton. He made his first start in 1966, a loss in the snow at home to the expansion Atlanta Falcons on December 4. Following the 1966 season, Tarkenton demanded to be traded and was sent to the New York Giants for multiple draft picks and Van Brocklin stepped down as head coach. Joe Kapp was the starting quarterback under new head coach Bud Grant in 1967 and Berry saw very limited action. In training camp in 1968, Berry was behind Kapp and Gary Cuozzo (acquired in a trade with the New Orleans Saints) and missed the final cut in early September.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nBerry was quickly picked up by the Atlanta Falcons in 1968, and Van Brocklin became the head coach after the third game of the season. Berry started 51 games for the Falcons in five seasons, through 1972, throwing for 8,489 yards and 57 touchdowns, with a passer rating of 79.2. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1969, and was traded back to the Vikings in May 1973 for fellow backup QB Bob Lee.\nSecond stint with Vikings.\nBerry played for the Minnesota Vikings again for four seasons, beginning in 1973. He was again the backup to Tarkenton, and Minnesota played in three Super Bowls (VIII, IX, and XI) during this second stint, all losses. Berry retired from football on the first day of 1977 training camp, July 28; Berry's position with the Vikings became tenuous when they drafted Tommy Kramer from Rice three months earlier.\nPersonal life and death.\nBerry had a daughter, Jennifer (born 1972) and a son, Michael (born 1993) and two grandchildren. Berry resided in Santa Cruz, California.\nBerry's younger brother Ken was the starting quarterback at San Jose State, and their two teams met in 1963.\nBerry died in Santa Cruz on April 17, 2023, at the age of 81."

        "text": "The men's coxed four was one of the competitions in the Rowing at the 1900 Summer Olympics events in Paris. The competition was plagued by controversy involving which boats should advance to the final. In one of the most unusual decisions in Olympic history, two separate finals were held for the event, each of which is still considered an Olympic championship by the International Olympic Committee. The crews of all six boats to compete in the two finals are Olympic medallists.\nThe coxed four event was held from 25 to 26 August 1900. Ten boats, involving fifty-one rowers from four nations, competed. The first final, featuring the three fastest losers from the semifinals, was won by a crew from the Cercle de l'Aviron Roubaix club of France, with another French crew (Club Nautique de Lyon) coming second and German team Favorite Hammonia third. The second final, featuring the semifinal winners, was won by Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club of Germany, with Dutch side Minerva Amsterdam finishing second and German crew Ludwigshafener Ruderverein third.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The tournament featured two rounds: semifinals and a final. There were three semifinals, each with three or four boats. \nThe original format provided for the three semifinal winners, plus the second-place boat in the third semifinal (with four competitors), advancing to the final. In other words, the last two boats in each semifinal would be eliminated.\nThe distance for each race was 1750 metres, rather than the 2000 metres which was becoming standard even at the time (and has been used in the Olympics since 1912, except in 1948).\nControversy.\nAfter the runner-up in the second semifinal and the third-place boat in the third semifinal, who should have been eliminated, had faster times than the winner of the first semifinal, the officials decided to hold another qualifying race. However, as the officials could not contact all of the teams involved, this race was scratched. \nThe officials later decided to have a six-boat final with the semifinal winners and the three fastest losers competing: as the course had been designed for a maximum of four boats, this was a preposterous decision, and the semifinal winners boycotted the final in protest.\nFollowing this fiasco, the officials decided to have a second final with the three semifinal winners plus the winner of the first final (Cercle de l'Aviron Roubaix) competing. However, this decision would have seen the first final become a \"de facto\" repechage: for this reason, as well as the fact they had already won the event under the rules in effect when the first final was held, the Cercle de l'Aviron Roubaix rowers flatly declined to compete in the second final.\nThus, the second final consisted only of the semifinal winners, resulting in two sets of medals being awarded for the event.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nInitially, the top boat in each semifinal plus the runner-up in the third semifinal (which had four boats instead of the three boats competing in each of the other two), were to advance. Following protests which ensued after the runner-up in the second semifinal and the third-place boat in the third semifinal each posted better times than the winner of the first, the qualification rules for the final were altered. Eventually, the six boats were broken into two groups and competed in separate finals. The runners-up in semifinals 2 and 3 as well as the third-place boat in semifinal 3 competed in the first final, while the three semifinal winners competed in the second."

The eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The distance for each race was 1750 metres, rather than the 2000 metres which was becoming standard even at the time (and has been used in the Olympics since 1912, except in 1948).\nThe tournament featured two rounds: semifinals and a final.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two boats in each semifinal were intended to advance to the final. However, only one boat in the second semifinal finished, so the third-place boat in the first semifinal advanced. This meant that of the five boats competing in the semifinal, the only one to not advance was the one that did not finish."

        "text": "Jerry Lindsey Martin (born May 11, 1949) is an American former Professional baseball outfielder. He spent 11 years in Major League Baseball, from to . On November 17, , Martin and Kansas City Royals teammates Willie Aikens and Willie Wilson each received three-month prison terms on misdemeanor attempted cocaine possession charges. They became the first active major leaguers to serve jail time.\nFurman University Paladins basketball.\nMartin was born in Columbia, South Carolina, and attended Olympia High School there. He then attended Furman University in Greenville. He starred in basketball, and was named the All-Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player in after leading the Furman Paladins to their first conference championship.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nDespite his prowess in basketball, he decided to follow his father, Barney Martin, who pitched in the majors with the Cincinnati Reds, as well as his younger brother, Michael, a left handed pitcher selected fifth overall in the 1970 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. A year later, Jerry signed with the club as an amateur free agent. Despite having spent three seasons together in the same organization, the brothers were never teammates.\nMartin earned Western Carolinas League MVP honors in , when he batted .316 with twelve home runs and 112 runs batted in for the Spartanburg Phillies. Over four seasons in the Phillies' farm system, Martin batted .303 with 43 home runs and 290 RBIs to earn a September call-up to the majors in . Making his major league debut as a late inning defensive replacement for Greg Luzinski on September 7, Martin did not log an at-bat. When given his first major league at bat two days later, he drove in Luzinski with the first run of the Phillies' 2-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.\nAfter splitting the season between the Phillies and the triple A Toledo Mud Hens, Martin spent the entire season serving as a late inning defensive replacement for Luzinski. He appeared in 130 games, but logged only 129 at-bats. He made just one plate appearance in the 1976 National League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds. He reached first base on an error, and scored on Jay Johnstone's triple in the ninth inning of the third game.\nDespite having been a promising prospect for the Phillies, Martin would never rise above fourth outfielder status over his next two seasons with the Phillies. Just as pitchers and catchers were reporting to Spring training in , Martin was sent to the Chicago Cubs in a blockbuster deal. He, Barry Foote, Ted Sizemore and minor leaguers Derek Botelho and Henry Mack went to the Cubs for Greg Gross, Dave Rader and Manny Trillo.\nChicago Cubs.\nFinally given the opportunity to start, Martin had a career year his first season in Chicago. Playing centerfield and batting sixth in the Cubs' line-up, Martin clubbed nineteen home runs, and drove in 73 runs while scoring 74. He followed that up with a career high 23 home runs in . After a contract dispute, Martin asked to be traded, and was sent to the San Francisco Giants with Jesús Figueroa and a player to be named later for Phil Nastu and Joe Strain at the 1980 Winter meetings.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nMartin signed a five-year deal shortly after arriving in San Francisco, however, his tenure with the Giants ended up being shorter than expected. His numbers dipped in the strike shortened season, as he hit just four home runs and drove in 25 while batting .241. After just one season with the Giants, Martin was dealt to the Kansas City Royals for pitchers Rich Gale and Bill Laskey.\nKansas City Royals.\nA new position came with his change of scenery, as Martin was shifted to right field with the Royals. He got off to a hot start in Kansas City, batting .304 with five home runs and 25 RBIs through May. Though he would cool off by the end of the season, his .266 batting average, fifteen home runs and 65 RBIs in was a marked improvement over his previous season.\nHe got off to a fast start in as well, but a muscle tear in his right wrist ended his season on April 24. Toward the end of the 1983 season, Martin and several of his Royals teammates were questioned by U.S. Attorney Jim Marquez in connection with a federal cocaine probe. Following the season, he, Willie Aikens and Willie Wilson pleaded guilty to attempting to purchase cocaine, while former teammate Vida Blue pleaded guilty to possession of three grams of cocaine. On November 17, Martin, Aikens, Blue and Wilson were all sentenced to a year in prison, with nine months of it suspended, and ordered to surrender to a Fort Worth, Texas, minimum security federal correctional institution on December 5 (Aikens was given until January 5 in order to complete a drug treatment program).\nNew York Mets.\nMartin was released early from prison on February 23, , however, Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn subsequently suspended all four players for the entire season. The suspensions were reduced after appeal, and the four were allowed to return to their teams on May 15. By then, Martin had signed with the New York Mets.\nMartin joined the Mets on May 16 in San Francisco. Through 51 games with the Mets, Martin managed just a .154 batting average, three home runs and five RBIs, and was released on September 30.\nA bid for a comeback in found no takers, so he retired. Martin took a coaching job in the Phillies' minor league system shortly after his retirement. He spent the first six weeks of the season as interim first base coach for the eventual World Champion Phillies while Davey Lopes was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Martin most recently served as hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers' double A affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, in and .\nTommy John called Martin \"a strong defensive outfielder.\"\nHe is the son of Barney Martin, who pitched in a single game for the Cincinnati Reds in ."

        "title": "Turkish archery",
        "text": "Turkish archery () is a tradition of archery which became highly developed in the Ottoman Empire, although its origins date back to the Eurasian Steppe in the second millennium BC.\nTraditional Turkish archery has been inscribed on the Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO in 2019.\nHistory.\nFrom the decline of military archery after the Battle of Lepanto, mainly flight archery was practiced, and Turkish bowyers specialized in weapons which were particularly good for imparting high velocity to very light arrows. The sport of archery declined gradually until the reign of Mahmud II who made great efforts to revive it. He also ordered his archery student, Mustafa Kani, to write a book about the history, construction, and use of these bows, from which comes most of what is now known of Turkish bowyery.\nIn 1794, in a field outside London, the Turkish ambassador’s secretary used a Turkish bow and arrow to shoot 415 yards, partially against the wind, and 482 yards with the wind. He said on a plain near Constantinople pillars were located that commemorate distances of 800 yards achieved with Turkish bows and arrows in ancient times.\nAfter the death of Mahmud II in 1839, archery resumed its decline. The living art of Turkish bowyery was lost in the 1930s with the death of the last bowyer and famous calligrapher, Neçmeddin Okyay; it has since been revived.\nFor many years the excellence of Turkish bows could be seen from historical records. In 1910 an archery contest was held on the beach at Le Touquet, France, where Ingo Simon was able to shoot an arrow 434 m using an old Turkish composite bow requiring a force of 440N or 99 lb.\nEquipment.\nTurkish bow.\nThe Turkish bow is a recurved composite bow used in the Ottoman Empire. The construction is similar to that of other classic Asiatic composite bows, with a wooden core (maple was most desirable), animal horn on the belly (the side facing the archer), and sinew on the front, with the layers secured together with animal glue. However, several features of the Turkish bow are distinct. The curvature tends to be more extreme when the bow is unstrung, with the limbs curling forward into the shape of the letter \"C\". With some bows, the rigid tips of the limbs (\"kasan\") even touch. The grip area is not recessed like other Asianic bows and is fairly flat on the belly, while the front of the grip bulges outwards.\nThe dramatic curvature of the bows makes stringing them very different from straighter bows found in Europe. There is an old saying in Turkey that there are \"120 ways to string a bow,\" though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip. Heavier bows usually require the use of a long, looped strap to pull the limbs back and hold them while the string is seated.\nIn the modern world, the Turkish bow is now predominantly used for sporting purposes. Authentic horn and sinew bows are still made but are both extremely costly and difficult to store outside certain environments and climates. For this reason, the majority of historically-styled bows of this type are made with some combination of fiberglass, hardwood (for the kasan) and resin, and with some being entirely resin.\nZihgir.\n\"Zihgir\" is the Turkish word for the thumb ring used to draw the bow in the Ottoman Empire. Turkish thumb rings were made of wood, metal, ivory, bone, horn or leather. These rings signified that the person wearing them was a warrior. In time they became a symbol of prestige in Ottoman society, and some later examples have so much ornamentation on the surface from which the bowstring slides that they could not be used to shoot with. Surviving examples are often made of precious metals and richly decorated. Some are carved from precious stones.\nSiper and Majra.\nThe \"siper\" and \"majra\" are devices used to draw arrows past the bow's front limb where the arrow would normally rest. The siper is a type of shelf strapped to the archer's bow hand, which allows the archer to use arrows several inches shorter (and therefore lighter) in order to get the maximum amount of force behind the arrow. They are most commonly used for Flight Archery, to achieve the greatest distance. The Majra is a thin piece of wood with a channel cut in it and small loop for the archer's draw hand. The device allows the archer to pull back arrows that are much shorter than were intended for the bow. There is some debate among historians if this device was designed to shoot arrows that were too short for the enemy to pick up and shoot back, or if it was a way to reuse bolts fired by Chinese crossbowmen. In modern times they are primarily used in Flight Archery to shoot shorter arrows to cut down on weight.\nTechnique.\nLike many other Eastern archery styles, Turkish archery uses a \"thumb draw\", employing a type of grip called \"mandal\". This grip prevents the arrow from moving if the archer is on a horse and/or firing at an unusual angle. The draw itself is relatively short, usually under the chin or by the cheek, compared to archery styles in China or Japan where the nock is pulled past the head. When the arrow is released, the draw arm is kept relatively steady rather than allowing the arm to swing backwards.\nTurkish archers developed several unique techniques to aid in combat. One was the practice of holding several arrows in between the fingers of the draw hand, allowing fast repeat shots. Another technique involved drawing the bow with the draw arm going behind the head to fire at a steep downward angle. This was used to fire from atop walls down at enemy troops."

Matches between January and April are defined as belonging to the 2005–06 season, while matches between September and December are defined as the 2006–07 season. The main matches in this period were played in England, as this was in the middle of the English cricket season, but the third edition of the ICC Intercontinental Cup is defined as a part of the 2006 season, even though the tournament stretched into February 2007, and three A teams were also scheduled to tour the northwestern part of Australia in June and July 2006.\nApril 2006.\nEurAsia Cricket Series.\nThis was a series held at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, between three A teams (second-choice teams) from Test-playing nations, two A teams from One Day International-playing nations, and the hosting nation UAE. India A and Pakistan A played in the final, while Netherlands A and Ireland A went home without any wins. UAE finished second in their group, after winning two games, while Sri Lanka A's three wins saw them second behind Pakistan A.\nThe top team from Group A and the second and third placed in Group B were placed in Group C; the others in Group D. Results from the first group stage were carried forward.\nZimbabwe in West Indies.\nA Test match series was originally planned, but Zimbabwe withdrew temporarily from Test cricket before this tour, and it was instead agreed to arrange seven One Day Internationals instead of five\nZimbabweans in West Indies in 2006. One-Day International series result: West Indies won 5–0.\nMay 2006.\nSri Lanka in England.\nEngland return home on the back of a disastrous Winter tour of the sub-continent, having not won any of the series before or after Christmas; while Sri Lanka look to compound their win against Bangladesh.\nSri Lankans in England 2006: Test Series drawn 1-1.

Zimbabwe won the tournament after going through unbeaten, while Bermuda finished second after winning their inaugural ODI - before losing twice to Zimbabwe.\nJune 2006.\nEngland in Ireland.\nIreland lost their debut One Day International, but England's win described by Cricinfo as \"unspectacular\", with Marcus Trescothick making 113 after England chose to bat first. Irish native Ed Joyce opened the innings for England, scoring 10 before he was caught by Kevin O'Brien, but a 142-run partnership between Trescothick and Ian Bell for the fourth wicket brought 200 up for England. England scored 84 off the last ten overs, with Bell making an ODI career high of 80. Ireland did bat out 50 overs, but no one could match the scores of Trescothick and Bell; Andre Botha made the best attempt, but his 52 lasted 89 balls, well below the required run rate of six an over. Steve Harmison took three wickets, but conceded 58 runs after bowling an opening spell described by The Times as \"a curate's egg\". Ireland's highest-scoring partnership was for the seventh wicket, with Andrew White adding 64 with O'Brien.\nBangladesh A in Zimbabwe.\nBangladesh A toured Zimbabwe for three first class and five one-day matches against the A team of the hosting nation. The first-class series ended in a draw after Bangladesh A fell to defeat in the third match after giving Zimbabwe A the first-innings lead of 203 to eventually lose the match by seven wickets. However, Bangladesh A secured the one-day series by winning the first three games.\nZimbabwe A v Bangladesh A. First-class series: Drawn 1–1. One-day series: Bangladesh A won 4–1.\nPakistan in Scotland.\nPakistan won the match by five wickets, after Scotland lost four wickets in the first eight overs and then four more in the remaining 42. Ryan Watson and Neil McCallum put on 116 for the fifth wicket, an ODI record partnership for Scotland, who played their first ODI for seven years. Their innings also doubled the number of ODI fifties scored for Scotland.\nEAP Cricket Trophy.\nThis tournament determined one qualifier from the East-Asia Pacific region to Division Three of the 2007 World Cricket League. Three teams, Cook Islands (qualified from the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup), Fijian and Japan (qualified from the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup) played in the tournament, which was held in Brisbane using a double round robin format. Fiji went through the tournament unbeaten.\nEAP Cricket Trophy. Teams: Cook Islands, Fiji, Japan. Winners: Fiji\nJuly 2006.\nSri Lanka in the Netherlands.\nSri Lanka batted first in both matches, and won both. In the first match, they surpassed the world record ODI total set by South Africa four months earlier, making 443 for four on their way to a 195-run victory. Both Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan made centuries. Sri Lanka made two changes for the second match, with Jayasuriya resting, and still won the second match by 55 runs\nSri Lanka in the Netherlands in 2006. One-day International series: Sri Lanka won 2–0.\nTop End Series.\nThe top end refers to the \"Top End\" of Australia geographically, i.e. the cities of Darwin and Cairns, who are set to host these matches\nPakistan in England.\nAfter a draw in the first Test, Andrew Strauss led his team to back-to-back Test victories and secured the series before the fourth and final Test. That Test was marred by a ball-tampering controversy, which culminated in Pakistan refusing to take the field after the tea interval in protest to a decision by umpire Darrell Hair to penalise the Pakistani team for ball-tampering. This led the umpires eventually to award the game to England, who thus won the Test series 3–0.\nPakistani cricket team in England in 2006. Test series result: England won 3–0. Twenty20 International: Pakistan won one-off match. One-day International Series: Drawn 2–2.\nSouth Africa in Sri Lanka.\nOriginally, South Africa was set to play Sri Lanka and India in the tri-nation Unitech Cup one-day cricket tournament.

The three matches between Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland were official One-day Internationals, though the match between Netherlands and Ireland was called off. Despite finishing last, Italy qualified for World Cricket League Div III because of other 4 nations already qualified for the league, so Italy claims the place as the best non-qualified nation.\nKenya in Canada.\nThis was originally scheduled to be a triangular series between Bermuda, Canada and Kenya. However, after Kenya rescheduled their ODIs with Bangladesh due to their lack of financial backing, they also cancelled their matches against Bermuda. The ODI series followed the Intercontinental Cup tie between the two nations, which Canada shaded by 25 runs; however, in the short form, Kenya won after bowling Canada out for 129 in the first match and 94 in the second.\nKenyans in Canada in 2006. ODI series: Kenya won 2–0.\nBangladesh in Kenya.\nBangladesh were originally scheduled to play three One Day International matches between 19 July and 23 July.

ODI series: Bangladesh won 3–0.\nIndia in Sri Lanka.\nAs in 2005, Sri Lanka were set to start their international home season with a triangular series at home following a 2-Test series. India came to visit, in addition to the already touring South Africans, and the three teams were set to contest 2006 Unitech Cup. The first four matches was scheduled to be held in Dambulla, and the last three, two group matches and a final, will be held at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. However, the venue of the series became an issue in the elections for presidency of Sri Lanka Cricket, with the sitting presidents wishing to move the series to Colombo, as they feared sabotage from the opposition group if the opposition lost the elections. The opposition, however, wanted to host the matches in Dambulla. On 13 July, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said that their team would play all matches in Colombo, and a few days later a group of former cricketers were nominated to run Sri Lanka Cricket after the elections were cancelled after advice from the country's president, Mahinda Rajapakse.\nThe tournament was postponed by two days following rain and a bomb blast near the South African team hotel. After receiving an independent security report, the United Cricket Board of South Africa announced that they were pulling out of the tournament, leaving India and Sri Lanka to play a three-match series. The first of these games was rained off.\nThe series is later cancelled due to rain and bad weather during the three ODIs, the series will be played as a tri-series in 2007, after the World Cup.\nIndians in Sri Lanka in 2006.\nAsian Cricket Council Trophy.\nThis tournament is arranged by the Asian Cricket Council and is open to every non-Test member nation of the ACC. 17 nations are taking part in the event in Kuala Lumpur.

The tournament took place between 21 August and 26 August.\nCanada, Bermuda and the USA had already qualified for the World Cricket League based on their performances in the 2005 ICC Trophy, and, as Cayman Islands finished in third place ahead of Argentina, the Caymans qualified for Division Three of the 2007 League. Bermuda won all their games except for a rained-off clash with USA, while Canada lost their first two and failed to get better than fourth despite a ten-wicket win over USA in the final game.\nAfrican Championship.\nThis tournament was held in Dar-es-Salaam between the five top African nations that have not already qualified for the global divisions of the World Cricket League through performances at the 2005 ICC Trophy. Five teams took part, four of which, Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia all took part at the 2004 Six Nations World Cup Qualifying Series Tournament in Africa, finishing from third to sixth, while Mozambique won the Africa Division Two event in April to qualify for this Division One tournament. The winner of this tournament, the hosts Tanzania, qualified for Division Three in the global World Cricket League."

It began on March 14, 2006, and concluded with the championship game on April 3 at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nThe Final Four featured no top seeds for the first time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 (the first time since 1980), with the highest remaining seed being Oakland region winner, #2 UCLA, making their first Final Four appearance since their 1995 national championship. For only the second time in history, an 11-seed advanced to the Final Four as George Mason of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) won the Washington, D.C. region. Those two teams were joined by Atlanta region winner LSU (who was the first team to advance to the Final Four as an 11-seed in 1986), and Minneapolis region winner Florida, who had not made the Final Four since their runner-up finish in 2000 also in Indianapolis.\nFlorida won its first-ever national basketball championship by defeating UCLA 73–57 in the final game. Florida's Joakim Noah was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA tournament.\nGeorge Mason's run was one of several upsets by lower-seeded teams in the tournament. For the second consecutive year, a No. 14 seed beat a No. 3 seed as Northwestern State defeated Iowa. No. 13 seed Bradley also defeated No. 4 seed Kansas and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating No. 5-seeded Pittsburgh in the second round. Two No. 12 seeds won as well, as Montana and Texas A&amp;M both won their respective First round matchups. For the second straight year, Milwaukee won as a double-digit seed, this time as the No. 11-seeded Panthers defeated Oklahoma in the first round.\nAmerican East Conference champion Albany and ASUN champion Belmont made their first appearance in the tournament.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 65 teams were selected to participate in the tournament. Of that total, 31 of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments. Penn earned an automatic bid by winning the regular-season title of the Ivy League, which did not conduct a conference tournament. The remaining 34 teams were granted \"at-large\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nThe initial game on March 14 officially named the opening round game, but popularly called the \"play-in game\", had Monmouth, winner of the Northeast Conference tournament, facing Hampton, who won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament, for a chance to play top seed Villanova in the first round of the Tournament. Monmouth defeated Hampton, 71–49, to advance to play Villanova.\nAll teams were seeded from 1 to 16 within their regions. The Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. In a practice used since 2004, the ranking of the four top seeds against each other would determine the pairings in the Final Four. The top overall seed would be seeded to play the fourth overall seed in the national semifinals, should both teams advance that far.

        "title": "1999 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1999 followed the system in use since 1995. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected three: George Brett, Nolan Ryan, and Robin Yount. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and selected four people from multiple classified ballots: Orlando Cepeda, Nestor Chylak, Frank Selee, and Smokey Joe Williams.\nBrett, Ryan, and Yount were all newly eligible, as they each played their last game in 1993. It was the first time the writers elected more than two first-ballot candidates, other than the five players selected for the inaugural class of .\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were held on July 25, 1999, with George Grande as master of ceremonies and Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1979 or later but not after 1993 (final game, 1979 to 1993). There were 28 candidates, 17 returning from the 1998 ballot, where they received at least 5% support, and 11 on the ballot for the first time (†), chosen by a screening committee from players who last appeared in 1993.\nThe field of newly-eligible candidates, who played their last games during 1993, included 19 All-Stars (10 on the ballot) with a total of 63 All-Star selections. They included 13-time All-Star George Brett, 11-time All-Star Carlton Fisk, 8-time All-Star Nolan Ryan, and 7-time All-Star Dale Murphy. There were four Most Valuable Players in the field (Brett, Murphy, Robin Yount, and George Bell, of whom Murphy and Yount won two MVPs) and two Rookies of the Year (Fisk and Alfredo Griffin).\nAll 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to participate by voting for as many as 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots returned would be honored with induction to the Hall. The results were announced on January 5, 1999. A total of 497 ballots were cast, so 373 votes were required for election. A total of 3,348 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.74 per ballot. Three players were elected: Ryan, Brett, and Yount. Sixteen players who last appeared from 1980 to 1993 were forwarded to next year.\nCandidates who received less than 5% support, or 25 votes, would not appear on future BBWAA ballots (*). They were also eliminated, at the time, from future consideration by the Veterans Committee. Mickey Lolich and Minnie Miñoso were on the ballot for the 15th and final time, although Miñoso's term as a candidate was not consecutive.\nNewly-eligible players who did not reach the ballot included Juan Agosto, Wally Backman, Steve Balboni, Randy Bush, Iván Calderón, Henry Cotto, Glenn Davis, Ken Dayley, Frank DiPino, Bill Doran, Dan Gladden, Alfredo Griffin, Kelly Gruber, Neal Heaton, Steve Lake, Terry Leach, Bob McClure, Gene Nelson, Pete O'Brien, Geno Petralli, Ted Power, John Russell, Bryn Smith, Tim Teufel, Dickie Thon, José Uribe, Bob Walk, Chico Walker, Curtis Wilkerson, Glenn Wilson, Curt Young, and Matt Young.\nVeterans Committee.\nThe Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953.\nThe older players eligible were those with 10 major league seasons beginning 1945 or earlier; those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in an election up to 1990; and those who received at least 60% support in an election beginning 1991. Players on Major League Baseball's ineligible list were also ineligible for election.\nBy an arrangement since 1995, the committee separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those two special ballots. It elected four people, the maximum number permitted: first baseman Orlando Cepeda from the 1960s, umpire Nestor Chylak, pitcher Smokey Joe Williams from the Negro leagues, and manager Frank Selee from the 19th century.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nBob Stevens received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 1998 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 1998, and conferred in the summer 1999 ceremonies.)\nFord C. Frick Award.\nArch McDonald posthumously received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster."

        "title": "Dave Baker (American football)",
        "text": "Dave Baker (July 30, 1937 – September 4, 2002) was a defensive back in the National Football League (NFL), playing for the San Francisco 49ers for three years.\nDavid Baker grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, earning All-State honors in football, basketball and baseball. He enrolled at the University of Oklahoma in 1955 under legendary coach Bud Wilkinson. During his three years of eligibility (freshmen were not eligible in 1955), the Sooners went 30-2, were in the midst of their 47-game win streak (still an NCAA record), and won the Big 7 conference title all three years. Players played both ways at the time, Baker playing defensive back, quarterback and running back. In 1959, he was drafted into the NFL as the fifth pick of the 1st round by the San Francisco 49ers. In the last 40 years of Sooner football (226 NFL draft picks), only Lee Roy Selmon, Billy Sims and Tony Casillas have been drafted higher. Baker played Safety for the 49ers for three seasons (1959–1961) and still to this day holds the 49ers interception per season record, making 21 career interceptions, an average of seven per season. In his 1959 rookie season, he was selected to the NFL All-Pro team. Monte Clark, an All-Pro tackle with the Cleveland Browns and later an NFL head coach, spoke to the 1965-66 SNU basketball team and stated, “In my fifteen-year NFL pro career, David Baker was the hardest hitting and best defensive back I have seen in the NFL.”\nAfter serving two years in the U.S. Army, a return to the NFL to a signed contract seemed imminent, but a different path would be charted. Dr. Roy Cantrell, president of Southern Nazarene University, called, asking for a meeting to discuss with David the possibility of coming to SNU to begin intercollegiate athletics and be a professor of physical education. The position would include being the first athletic director and head basketball coach. Forsaking a lucrative NFL contract and all of its amenities, David and Edna Baker came to Bethany, signed an SNU contract worth $3,600 annually and began a dream.\nWith no intercollegiate program, no scholarships and no budget, Coach Baker set out with a vision that SNU could become one of America's finest small college athletic programs. At age 27, with a background in the country's finest collegiate football program (OU) and the NFL (49ers), Coach Baker believed that the greatest impact and athletic experience could happen where athletics in a \"Christian atmosphere” thrived.\nDuring Coach Baker's tenure (1964–1974) a long list of significant accomplishment occurred: the first two men's basketball seasons had winning marks (men's basketball was the only intercollegiate sport for four years); the Benchwarmer Club was formed in 1968; the first scholarships awarded in 1969; the Redskin Revolution to change the course of sportsmanship in society occurred (a new method of introducing players was introduced, which later was adopted by high school, college and pro teams across America); sports were added to include women's basketball, baseball, women's volleyball, men's and women's tennis. On the basketball court, the innovation of the big man playing the point on the 3-2 zone defense was introduced in Broadhurst in 1971, to be copied around America at every level. The Spokesman Bicycle Tour group was formed to give hundreds of high school and college age kids a life changing experience in pedaling across America. In 1970, a goal was set to achieve a national title within a decade (it actually occurred in a decade plus one, 1981, in men's basketball under Head Coach Dr. Loren Gresham). Coach Baker set an athletic program on course with the assurance that “all things are possible to him who believes” (Mark 9:23)."

        "title": "Italian Open (golf)",
        "text": "The DS Automobiles Italian Open () is the men's national open golf championship of Italy. It was founded in 1925 and, except for 1933 and during World War II, was played annually until 1960. After an eleven-year hiatus, it returned in 1971 when it was one of five tournaments in Continental Europe that were included on the British PGA Order of Merit circuit. The following year of that circuit has since been recognised as the first official season of the European Tour, and the Italian Open is one of few tournaments that have featured on the schedule every year. The 2018 event was the 75th edition of the championship.\nIn 2017 the European Tour created the Rolex Series, a group of events with higher prize money, with the Italian Open being one of the designated events with total prize money increased to US$7 million, more than double that of the previous year. In 2020 the tournament was not part of the Rolex Series, having been rescheduled with much lower prize money due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHistory.\nIn 1935, British golfer Percy Alliss scored a 262 aggregate on his way to winning the event. He established the lowest 72-hole total ever in any golf tournament ever at the time. The legitimacy of the record was in doubt, according to \"Time\", as the length of the San Remo course was only 5,200 yards, far below the international \"championship standard.\" Many decades later, in 2008, South African Hennie Otto was just one stroke away from Alliss' total, still the tournament record.\nVenues.\nIn 1973 the first two rounds were played on two different courses, Acquasanta and Olgiata, everyone playing one round on each course. After the cut, Acquasanta was then used for the final two rounds.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 65 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2006-07 season. The 69th annual edition of the tournament began on March 13, 2007, with the opening round game and concluded with the championship game on April 2, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.\nBoth of the finalists from the year before returned to the Final Four as Florida, who returned its entire starting lineup from the year before, and UCLA advanced. They were joined in the Final Four by Ohio State, who was making its first appearance since their 1999 appearance (later vacated), and Georgetown, appearing for the first time since their national runner-up finish in 1985.\nFlorida successfully defended their title by defeating Ohio State in the championship 84–75. This marked the second time in 2007 that a Florida team beat an Ohio State team to win a national championship, as Florida's football team won the BCS National Championship Game over Ohio State in January. Florida's Corey Brewer was named the Most Outstanding Player. Florida became the first team to repeat since Duke in 1992, and were the seventh school to repeat overall. The 2007 Gators were the last team to repeat as national champions until the UConn Huskies repeated as national champions in 2024.\nThis tournament was notable because it featured significantly fewer upsets than prior years. There were only 12 games in which a lower-seeded team defeated a higher-seeded team, and eight of these \"upsets\" were by teams ranked only one seed lower than their opponent. As of 2024, this is the last tournament in which no team seeded 12 or lower won a round of 64 game, while No. 7-seed UNLV was the lowest-seeded team to make it to the Sweet Sixteen. This marked the second time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams that no team seeded No. 8 or lower played in the Sweet Sixteen; the other instance was in 1995. Southland Conference champion Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi made their first NCAA appearance.\nThis was the first Tournament since 2003 that regional sites were designated as \"East\", \"West\", \"South\", and \"Midwest\", rather than by the names of the host cities.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 65 teams entered the tournament. Of that total, 30 of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments. The automatic bid of the Ivy League, which did not conduct a post-season tournament, went to its regular season champion, Penn. The remaining 34 teams were granted \"at-large\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nThe initial game on March 13 officially named the opening round game, but popularly called the \"play-in game\", had Niagara, winner of the Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament, facing Florida A&amp;M, who won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament, for a chance to play top seed Kansas in the first round of the Tournament. Niagara defeated Florida A&amp;M, 77–69, to advance to play Kansas.\nAll teams are seeded 1 to 16 within their regionals, while the Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 65.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2007 tournament:\nOpening Round\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nQualifying teams.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2007 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nHere are the top seeded teams in each regional and their overall seeds.\nBracket.\nOpening Round game – Dayton, Ohio.\nWinner advances to West Regional vs. No. (1) Kansas.\nGame summaries.\n\"Unless otherwise specified, all games were on CBS, except for the play-in game, which aired on ESPN and two additional games. Those games were broadcast on CSTV except in the natural areas of the teams involved, as those were broadcast on CBS. Times listed are US EDT (UTC−4).\"\n\"Team names are those listed on the NCAA's scoreboard for the play-in game and first-round matchups. Only UNLV and UCLA use abbreviations; all other names are unabbreviated except for the common abbreviation \"A&amp;M\".\"\nOpening rounds.\nFirst round upsets, close games, and other facts.\nThe two major upsets of the first round were #11 Virginia Commonwealth's win over #6 Duke (West Regional), and #11 Winthrop's win over #6 Notre Dame (Midwest Regional). VCU beat Duke, 79–77, on a shot by Eric Maynor with 1.8 seconds left, sending Duke out for the first time in the first round since 1996. Winthrop's highly touted offense built a 21-point second-half lead before surviving a late Notre Dame rally to win, 74–64, earning their first tournament victory in school history. The only overtime game of the first round was in the South Regional, between #7 Nevada and #10 Creighton, ending 77–71 in favor of the Nevada Wolf Pack. Other close games included #3 Oregon squeaking by #14 Miami (Ohio), 58-56 (Midwest Regional), #5 Virginia Tech's win over #12 Illinois 54-52 (West Regional), and #9 Xavier's win over #8 BYU, 79-77 (South Regional). The highest score accumulated by a team in the 2007 tournament went to Tennessee's 121 points over Long Beach State (South Regional), which set a school record. This was the first year since 1993 that a #10 seed did not advance to the second round. It was also only the second time in the last 17 years that a #12 seed failed to advance against a #5 seed. #15 Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi had leads of 10-0 and 25–7 in the first half against the #2 Wisconsin Badgers but Wisconsin prevailed 76–63.\nSecond round upsets, close games, and other facts.\nThe two biggest upsets of the second round were #6 Vanderbilt's win over #3 Washington State (East Regional) and #7 UNLV's win over #2 Wisconsin (Midwest Regional). Vanderbilt won a heart-stopper, 78–74, in double overtime. UNLV won by six points, 74–68, in their biggest win since the 1990s. Other overtime games included #1 Ohio State's 78–71 win over #9 Xavier (South Regional) and #3 Pittsburgh's 84–79 overtime victory over #11 Virginia Commonwealth (West Regional). Ohio State's Ron Lewis hit a three-pointer with two seconds remaining to force overtime against Xavier, and Pittsburgh fought Virginia Commonwealth's comeback from 19 points down to come up with the victory. The Ohio State win over Xavier had a controversial ending as prior to Lewis's game-tying shot, Buckeye Greg Oden shoved a Xavier player, Justin Cage, in the back and onto the floor. Had an intentional foul been called, Xavier would have been awarded two foul shots and ball possession. Instead, a regular personal foul was called. Subsequently, Xavier missed the second free throw, allowing Lewis to shoot the game-tying 3. Other close games were #3 Texas A&amp;M winning over #6 Louisville, 72-69 (South Regional); #5 Butler's victory over #4 Maryland, 62-59 (Midwest Regional); and #5 Tennessee defeating #4 Virginia, 77-74 (South Regional). This tournament marked the first time since 1995 that a double-digit seeded team did not advance to the Sweet 16 (Midwest #7 seed UNLV was the lowest team in the Sweet 16).\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) upsets, close games, other facts.\nNo upsets or overtime games occurred in this round of the tournament, although there were several very close games. In the South Region, #2 Memphis barely defeated #3 Texas A&amp;M as Aggie senior Acie Law, after a solid performance for most of the game, missed an open layup with under a minute left. A controversial clock situation with 3.1 seconds left added to the emotion. #1 Ohio State sneaked past #5 Tennessee, coming back from 20 points down to win, 85–84, with a blocked shot by Buckeye Greg Oden with 0.2 seconds left. In the East Region, #2 Georgetown won possibly the most controversial game of the tournament, beating #6 Vanderbilt, 66–65, on a shot by Jeff Green with 2.5 seconds left. The play was controversial as Green appeared to travel, despite fans and analysts claiming it was a clean drop step.\nRegional Finals (Elite Eight).\nThe seeds of the Elite Eight teams were four #1s, three #2s, and one #3. This was the lowest combination of seeds in an Elite Eight since seeding began in the NCAA tournament.\nAlthough Ohio State star freshman Greg Oden got into early foul trouble, a close game at the half turned into a blowout as the Buckeyes went on a 20–8 run to win. Game leaders were Memphis' Jeremy Hunt with 26 points, and Robert Dozier with 11 rebounds. This ended Memphis' 25-game win streak, previously the longest in the nation.\nAfter a tight first-half, the Bruins slowly put away the top-seeded Jayhawks in the second-half using their 2006 national championship game experience, along with a strong defense. Shooting percentage was a key factor in the game as UCLA shot 53% to Kansas's 41%. UCLA's Arron Afflalo led all scorers with 24 points while Brandon Rush of Kansas led the Jayhawks with 18. UCLA and Kansas combined for 35 steals, breaking the previous tournament record of 28.\nNorth Carolina led for most of the game and the entire second half, but Georgetown rallied from ten points down with six minutes remaining to force overtime. The Tar Heels were outscored 15–3 in the extra session, missing 22 of their final 23 field goal attempts. Georgetown reached its first Final Four since 1985, when John Thompson III's father John Thompson (Jr.) was coach—and Thompson III became the first coach to succeed his father in coaching a team to the Final Four. With North Carolina's loss in the regional final, this marked the first time since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams that no ACC team made it to the Final Four for two consecutive years. The last time that no ACC team made it to the Final Four in consecutive years was in 1979 and 1980.\nIn what was actually a close game for most of regulation, Florida's three-point shots, along with a 20–9 run in the second half, amounted to a Gator win. Florida player Lee Humphrey led his team with seven three-pointers, and added up a total of 23 points. In one of the more odd moments of the tournament, Humphrey shot a three-pointer through the side of the net, causing a 10-minute delay as the net was repaired.\nFinal Four.\nAll of the 2007 Final Four teams had participated in the 2006 tournament. Ohio State was knocked out in the second round by Georgetown, who would lose to Florida in the Minneapolis Regional semifinals. Florida would go on to defeat UCLA in the championship game. The four teams were all previous champions as well—Ohio State (1960), Georgetown (1984), UCLA (several), and Florida (2006)—marking the fourth time that all of the Final Four teams were past champions (joining 1993, 1995 and 1998 Final Fours). Also, it was the first time in nine years that no two Final Four teams were from the same conference.\nOhio State proved to be too much for the Hoyas, even with Ohio State's phenom center Greg Oden sitting most of the game due to foul trouble.\nIn the beginning, Florida struggled with UCLA's swarming defense, but ten minutes into the game they took a double-digit lead, and Lee Humphrey, in a performance reminiscent of the previous year's national title game, blew the game open in the second half hitting three consecutive three-pointers. Humphrey's shots proved too much to overcome and UCLA never threatened in the second half.\nNational Championship.\nA rematch of a regular season meeting, won 86-60 by Florida in Gainesville, The Gators survived 25 points and 12 rebounds from Buckeyes center Greg Oden with stellar play from guards Lee Humphrey and Taurean Green with inside contributions coming from Al Horford (18 points) and tourney Most Outstanding Player Corey Brewer. Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach (at age 41) to win two titles. Only Bob Knight (at Indiana) and San Francisco's Phil Woolpert both won two titles at the age of 40.\nThe Gators are the first team ever to hold the NCAA Division I college football and basketball titles in the same academic year (2006–07) and calendar year (2006 and 2007). Coincidentally, Florida also beat Ohio State (by a score of 41–14) in the College Football Championship, the first time in college sports history that identical matchups and results have occurred in both football and basketball championships. This was also the first time in NCAA D-I men's basketball history that exactly the same starting five were able to win back-to-back titles (Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer, Lee Humphrey, Al Horford, Taurean Green). Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA Tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47. Humphrey surpassed Bobby Hurley's record of 42.\nRecord by conference.\nThe America East, Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big West, Ivy, MEAC, Mid-American, Mid-Continent, Northeast, Ohio Valley, Patriot, Southern, Southland, Sun Belt, SWAC, and WCC all went 0–1.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports.\nFor the 26th consecutive year, CBS Sports telecast the tournament, and for the 17th consecutive year, broadcast every game from the first round to the championship, with Jim Nantz and Billy Packer calling the Final Four. Nantz was in a stretch in which he would broadcast Super Bowl XLI, the Final Four, and The Masters golf tournament all in a 10-week period.\nThe complete list of announcing teams follows:\nGreg Gumbel once again served as the studio host, joined by analysts Clark Kellogg and Seth Davis.\nOther television.\nCSTV, owned by CBS, telecast the George Washington-Vanderbilt and the Virginia-Albany contests (in addition to the local CBS affiliates nearest to the participating teams in those games, and those using their digital subchannels for simulcasting). Those games served as the first-ever live tourney telecasts on CSTV, which also provided a highlights show after each day of competition. \nFor the first three rounds of the tournament, games were also shown on DirecTV through the Mega March Madness pay-per-view service and on March Madness on Demand, a broadband Internet video streaming service that was a joint venture between CBS SportsLine (now known as CBSSports.com) and the NCAA.\nThe opening round game was broadcast on ESPN for the sixth consecutive year.\nRadio.\nWestwood One once again had the live radio coverage. Kevin Harlan once again served as the play-by-play man at the Final Four with Bill Raftery and John Thompson on color. Thompson the elder is the father of current Georgetown coach John Thompson III.\nBasketball courts.\nDuring the first- and second-round games in New Orleans, as part of the continuing recovery process from Hurricane Katrina, the NCAA allowed an additional floor decal recognizing the work of Habitat for Humanity's Collegiate Challenge and the NCAA Home Team program through the subregional's host institution, Tulane University. This marked the first time that a logo other than that of the NCAA or an NCAA member school has been allowed at an NCAA-sanctioned championship event. In addition, Tulane student athletes and athletic department personnel built a new house, valued at $75,000 (US), which was paid for by the NCAA and their corporate partner Lowe's, on Girod Street between the New Orleans Arena, site of the games, and the Louisiana Superdome, which has hosted four Final Fours.\nAlso, for the first time, custom-made, identical courts were used at all four regional sites in San Jose, St. Louis, San Antonio and East Rutherford.

        "text": "The 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 65 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2007-08 season. The 70th annual edition of the tournament began on March 18, 2008, and concluded with the championship game on April 7, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.\nFor the first time (and only time through the 2024 tournament) since seeding began in 1979, all four of the top seeds advanced to the Final Four. These were Memphis, the winner of the South region, UCLA, the winner of the West region making their third consecutive Final Four appearance, Kansas, the winner of the Midwest region, and overall number one seed and East region winner North Carolina, back in the Final Four for the first time since their 2005 national championship.\nMemphis and Kansas advanced to the national championship game, with Memphis's victory in the semifinals giving them a record-setting 38 for the season, beating the mark set by Duke in 1999 (Kentucky later matched this record in 2012 and 2015). Kansas, however, spoiled their national championship hopes by handing the Tigers their second loss of the season, winning the game in overtime, 75–68. Memphis's entire season was later vacated by the NCAA due to eligibility concerns surrounding freshman guard Derrick Rose.\nEntering the tournament on March 18, the top ranked team was North Carolina in both the AP Top 25 and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Polls, followed by Memphis, UCLA and Kansas.\nAmerican University (Patriot), UMBC (America East), Texas–Arlington (Southland), and Portland State (Big Sky) all entered the tournament for the first time in their school's history. Another school, Coppin State, won the MEAC Tournament to become the first 20-loss school to make the field. Georgia, a team that otherwise would not have advanced to the tournament, to qualify, and were awarded a #14 seed, the lowest by a major conference team in the tournament.\nWhereas the 2007 tournament did not see many upsets, the 2008 tournament was full of them. The sub-regional pod played at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida, featured four games where a double digit seed won. #5 seeds Drake and Clemson fell to #12 seeds Western Kentucky and Villanova while the #4 seeds in that same pod, Vanderbilt and Connecticut, were defeated by #13 seeds Siena and San Diego. Western Kentucky advanced to the West regional in Phoenix, where they lost to UCLA while Villanova was one of two double digit seeds to advance to the Midwest regional. The other was #10 seed Davidson, who rode the hot shooting of Stephen Curry to defeat Gonzaga, Georgetown, and Wisconsin before nearly upsetting Kansas in the regional final. The Midwest region alone saw four of its double digit seeds advance, as in addition to Villanova, Siena, and Davidson, #11 seed Kansas State knocked off #6 seed USC.\nThe total tournament attendance of 763,607 set a record for highest total tournament attendance, breaking the record set during the 1999 tournament.\nTournament procedure.\nThe NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship is an annual single-elimination tournament featuring 65 teams representing all Division I Conferences in the nation. A \"play-in\" game determined which of the two lowest seeds would play in the first round of 64 against a top seed team. The Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 65 within four regionals of 16 teams; Mount St. Mary's, as the winner of the play-in game, automatically received a 16 seed.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2008 tournament:\nOpening round\nFirst and second rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational Semifinals and Championship (Final Four and Championship)\nQualifying teams.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2008 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nListed by region and seeding.\nA total of 31 teams received automatic bids for winning their conference tournament championship. Since the Ivy League does not hold a tournament, its regular season champion received the automatic bid. This left 34 at-large bids to be decided from the rest of the field by the NCAA Selection Committee. The at-large bids, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, March 16. Coppin State was the first team to make the tournament with 20 losses. Maryland-Baltimore County, American, Texas–Arlington, and Portland State all received their first tournament bids in school history. Four teams returned after absences from the NCAA Tournament of 20 years or more—Drake (last appearing in 1971), Cal State Fullerton (1978), Cornell (1988), and Baylor (1988).\nBracket.\nOpening Round game – Dayton, Ohio.\nWinner advances to 16th seed in East Regional vs. (1) North Carolina.\nFinal Four – Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas.\nBracket Source \nGame summaries.\nEast Region.\nFirst round.\nTop seed North Carolina defeated the play-in game winner Mount St. Mary's 113–74. Their high scoring tied the mark for second most in North Carolina tournament history, aided by Tyler Hansbrough and Ty Lawson's 21 points each. They met Arkansas in the second round, a ninth seed who defeated eighth-seed Indiana 86–72. Indiana had struggled with several tough losses late in the season after a coaching scandal. Sonny Weems had a career-high 31 points despite Indiana having two AP All-Americans, D.J. White and Eric Gordon. Fifth seed Notre Dame advanced to the second round with a 68–50 win over 12th seed George Mason. George Mason had two starters from the 2006 final four team, but were unable to come back after a surge by the Irish early in the first half. In the same pod, fourth seeded Washington State defeated 13th-seed Winthrop 71–40, holding them to 11 points in the second half and leaving them far behind after a 25–1 run. In Birmingham, Alabama, the sixth seed Oklahoma defeated 11-th seeded St. Joseph's 72–64, led by David Godbold, a senior not normally known as a team leader who surprised many with his 25 points. Later in the evening, third seeded Louisville defeated WAC champion and 14th seed Boise State 79–61, sending the Broncos home for the second straight time. They had defeated Boise St. in the 1994 tournament as well, the last time the WAC team came to the tournament. In the afternoon session at Birmingham, seventh seeded Butler defeated tenth seed South Alabama in an 81–61 blowout, setting a school record for 30 wins in one season, and number two seed Tennessee survived a brief scare at the hands of 15th-seeded American, 72–57. American's star player, Garrison Carr, led his team with 26 points, tying the game at 40 with 11 minutes to go before Tennessee went on a 10–0 run to score the win.\nSecond round.\nWashington State, the region's fourth seed, was first to earn a spot in the Charlotte, North Carolina East Regional by handily beating fifth-seeded Notre Dame, 61–41 in Denver, Colorado. The rout came as a shock to many sportscasters, who expected Notre Dame's offense, which was averaging about 80 points a game, to outdo the Cougars. Instead, Notre Dame shot 24% from the field, their worst offensive effort since 1983 and the fifth-worst in the history of the NCAA tournament's opening rounds. Washington State's win brought them to their first-ever trip to the Sweet 16. Top-seeded North Carolina will challenge the Cougars after defeating Arkansas, the ninth seed, 108–77. The win marked only the third time the Tar Heels had won their first two tournament games by more than 20 points. The other two UNC teams to do this, in 1993 and 2005, went on to win the championship. With the win, North Carolina also set a school record for wins in a season, with 34. Second-seeded Tennessee survived an upset bid from number seven seed Butler, winning in overtime 76–71. Butler was behind throughout regulation, but managed to keep the game close and bring it to overtime, where they gained their first lead, 68–66, about 2 minutes into overtime. Some key defensive stands and free throws by the Volunteers, however, pulled them ahead. They will play third seed Louisville, who beat sixth seed Oklahoma, 78–48. Sooner star Blake Griffin had trouble scoring against Louisville's double-teams, and Louisville's 30-point win was the school's best tournament win since 1968.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nTop-seeded North Carolina defeated fourth seeded Washington State 68–47. Washington State was held to 47 points, the least allowed by a Tar Heel team in the tournament since 1946. Tyler Hansbrough struggled in the first half, but North Carolina's other players stepped to give the team a 14-point lead at halftime. In the second half, he led the team with 16 points, contributing to what was at one point in the half a 26-point lead. Third-seeded Louisville went on to face the Tar Heels in the East finals after defeating the second-seeded Tennessee Volunteers, 79–60. Earl Clark scored 17 points, 13 of them coming in the second half, and had 12 rebounds to lead the Cardinals. The Volunteers were held to 34% shooting and Louisville coach Rick Pitino improved to 8–0 in Regional semifinal games.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nIn the East Regional finals in their home state, against third-seed Louisville, Tyler Hansbrough of the top-seeded Tar Heels carried the team with a 28-point performance, including five straight points after the Cardinals tied UNC midway through the second half to lead UNC to an 83–73 win. The Cardinals came close as the game neared its end, but a Ty Lawson 3 broke a 59–59 tie. Defensive stands combined with 8 for 8 free throw shooting down the stretch gave the Tar Heels the victory. Hansbrough was named the East Region's Tournament MVP.\nMidwest Region.\nFirst round.\nThe Midwest Region featured upsets knocking off the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these was the first upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80–67 in Omaha, Nebraska. The media had focused a lot of attention on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' Michael Beasley and the Trojans' O. J. Mayo. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, it was the other K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack and coming up with the school's first tournament win since 1988. Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82–76 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Stephen Curry led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half. His 40 points are the fifth most in NCAA tournament history, and gave Davidson their first tournament win since 1969. In the same region, 13th seed Siena upset fourth seed Vanderbilt 83–62 in Tampa, Florida. Future Harlem Globetrotter Tay Fisher made all six of his 3-point attempts, the Saints never trailed and became the first MAAC team to advance since 2004. The Midwest's first-round play ended with 12th seed Villanova's upset of fifth seed Clemson, 75–69, also in Tampa. Behind by eighteen late in the first half, the Wildcats came back, taking the lead at about the twelve-minute mark and holding it for the win. The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day. Earlier in the day, WKU, San Diego, and Siena defeated Drake, UConn, and Vanderbilt, to set the record.\nEarlier that day in Omaha, ninth seed Kent State tied an NCAA Tournament record for scoring lows with their 10 points in one half against UNLV. Eighth-seed UNLV won the game 71–58. Top seed Kansas defeated 16th seed Portland State 85–61, thoroughly dominating both inside and outside with the win. Second-seed Georgetown defeated fifteenth seed Maryland-Baltimore County 66–47 in their first-round game, holding them to 31% shooting as compared to their 51%, and third seed Wisconsin stopped an upset threat from 14th seed Cal State Fullerton. The Titans' Josh Akognon scored 31 points, tying a career high, and Fullerton held the lead early in the second half, but were unable hold the lead under the Badgers' offensive pressure.\nSecond round.\nThe third-seeded Badgers from the University of Wisconsin defeated Kansas State, 72–55 to become the first school to advance to Detroit, Michigan, and the Midwest Regional. KSU freshman star Michael Beasley was again dominant with 23 points and 14 rebounds, though he struggled in the second half with only six points due to the Badger defense. Top-seeded Kansas also advanced to the Sweet 16 by defeating eighth-seed UNLV 75–56. Four Jayhawks scored in double figures and the team shot 58% from the field while holding the Rebels to 26.7%. The following afternoon, the 12th-seeded Villanova Wildcats defeated the 13th-seeded Siena Saints in a 12-seed versus 13-seed Cinderella match-up by a score of 84–72 to reach their third Sweet 16 in four years. The Wildcats took an early lead and never trailed the entire game. Tenth-seeded Davidson became the second double-digit seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen hours after Villanova's victory, ousting second-seeded Georgetown 74–70, to play Wisconsin in the other regional semifinal. Davidson won on the back of another tour-de-force performance in the second half by Stephen Curry. Curry singlehandedly outscored the Hoyas over the final 14:24, putting up 25 points to Georgetown's 22.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nStephen Curry scored 33 points to lead Davidson to a 73–56 victory over Wisconsin. Davidson, the 10-seed, advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time since the 1969 tournament. Curry became only the fourth player in history to score 30 or more points in his first three tournament games. The Wisconsin defense, best in the nation at points allowed with 53.9, remained close until early in the second half, when some key steals and Davidson threes pulled the Wildcats far ahead.\nIn the night game, top-seeded Kansas defeated # 12 Villanova, 72–57. The Jayhawks went on a 14–2 run early and never faltered—Villanova never getting within six. Brandon Rush, Russell Robinson, and Mario Chalmers each scored 16, 15, and 14 points, respectively.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nKansas completed the first all top-seeded Final Four in NCAA Tournament history as they defeated tenth seeded Davidson 59–57. The outcome remained in doubt down to the final seconds. Kansas' Sherron Collins missed a shot with 21 seconds left, giving Davidson the final shot. Sophomore star Stephen Curry was double teamed, couldn't find a shot, and passed to Jason Richards, whose three-point shot missed. It was head coach Bill Self's first regional final win. The Wildcats' 25-game winning streak, the longest in the nation, was broken with the loss. Davidson's Stephen Curry scored 25 points and was chosen as the Midwest Region's Most Outstanding Player.\nSouth Region.\nFirst round.\nTop seed Memphis took on Texas–Arlington, the region's 16th seed, and went on to win their opening-round contest, 87–63, in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Memphis went on to meet Mississippi State, an eight seed which came back from 13-down early in the second half against Oregon to rally for the win, 76–69. Fifth-seed Michigan State handily defeated # 12 Temple, 72–61, and fourth-seed Pittsburgh defeated 13th seed Oral Roberts 82–63, leaving the Golden Eagles behind after an 18–0 run in the first half. Sixth-seeded Marquette won its first tournament game since 2003 with a 74–66 win over #11 Kentucky in Anaheim. Kentucky got to within two points with 22 seconds remaining, but two Marquette free throws and a late steal handed the Wildcats an early tournament loss. They met third seed Stanford in the next round, who handily defeated 14th-seeded Cornell 77–53, never trailing the entire game, and never allowing the Big Red to get closer than 18 points in the second half. Miami (Florida), the seventh seed, defeated tenth seed Saint Mary's (California) 78–64, led by Jack McClinton and his 38 points. Their next opponent was second seed Texas, who never trailed in their 74–54 win over 15th seed Austin Peay, a game with four Longhorns scoring in double-figures.\nSecond round.\nThird-seeded Stanford saw Brook Lopez make the difference in overtime with a basket with 1.3 seconds left to beat Marquette 82–81 and advance to Houston, Texas. Stanford coach Trent Johnson was ejected in the first half, and Stanford had to fight a six-point deficit at halftime to come back for the win. Michigan State became the first lower seed to win in the region, with a 65–54 victory over Pittsburgh. The game was extremely physical and hard-fought, with the Panther coming back from 10 down to take the lead in the middle of the second half, only to see it vanish in the final minutes with help from eight straight points from the Spartan's Drew Neitzel. The Spartans would go on to play Memphis, the region's top seed after the Tigers beat eighth seed Mississippi State, 77–74. In their game, Memphis had four players scoring in double figures in what was a physical, defensive game—unlike what the games the Tigers were used to playing. Mississippi State gave them a late scare by coming to within two with four seconds left, but a free throw by Chris Douglas-Roberts of Memphis followed by a missed three on Mississippi's end gave the Tigers the win. Texas, the second seed, played the Cardinal in their home state after a 75–72 victory over seventh-seed Miami (Florida). Leading 66–50 with 4:15 left in the game, the Longhorns saw their lead melt in the face of a strong Hurricane rally and a hostile Arkansas crowd. Two key free throws by A. J. Abrams with 9.5 seconds left carried them to a three-point lead which held to the end of regulation.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nTens of thousands of Texas fans turned out to Reliant Stadium in Houston and saw the second seeded Longhorns defeat the number three seeded Stanford Cardinal, 82–62. The unlikely defensive star of the game was Texas' Dexter Pittman. Normally not even a starter, Pittman was effective on the court, throwing his size against the tall Lopez twins, high-scorers at Stanford. On the offensive end, D. J. Augustin scored twenty-three points to combine with Damion James' 18 for the win. Stanford made things close at about the 13 minute mark of the second half, bringing it to within one at 52–51, but Texas went on a 16–2 run and turned the game into a rout. Later in the day, top-seeded Memphis defeated fifth seed Michigan State, 92–74. Memphis entered the game as the favorite but with several commentators pointing to them as the top seed most likely to lose. Instead, the Tigers went into halftime with a 30-point lead. Derrick Rose led his team with 27 points, and Chris Douglas-Roberts followed with 25, while Spartan star Drew Neitzel was held to just six.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nTop seeded Memphis defeated the Texas Longhorns to earn the third pass into the Final Four for the first time in 23 years with a convincing 85–67 win. Memphis spread the floor and used every man on the field to win. Texas star D J Augustin scored 16 points, but struggled with four turnovers in the second half. Derrick Rose won the Region's Most Outstanding Player award.\nWest Region.\nFirst round.\nIn the West Region, with a pod in Tampa as well, WKU entering as the 12th seed, defeated fifth seeded Drake in overtime 101–99. Drake had come back from sixteen down in the final eight minutes, bringing the game to overtime, and were ahead with 5.7 seconds left. Ty Rogers' three-pointer at the buzzer, the NCAA record-setting 30th three-point basket gave the Hilltoppers the walk-off victory. Also in the West, 13th seeded San Diego upset fourth seed Connecticut 70–69 in another overtime game. The Huskies struggled throughout the game, compounded by the loss of leading scorer A.J. Price to a torn ACL, and De'Jon Jackson's long jumper with 1.2 seconds remaining in the bonus period pulled the Toreros ahead for their first-ever tournament victory, and handed UConn their earliest egress from the tournament since 1979 as well as the first under coach Jim Calhoun. As regards to close games and record-breakers, West Region 15th seed Belmont nearly upset second-seeded Duke in Washington, D.C., but a Gerald Henderson layup with 11.9 seconds left, together with a steal off the inbounds by DeMarcus Nelson in the final seconds, lifted the Blue Devils to victory. This would have been only the fifth time a 15 seed beat a 2 seed. The top seeded UCLA Bruins set several records in their win against 16th-seeded Mississippi Valley State at Anaheim, California, holding them to 29 points in a 70–29 victory. This was the lowest score in the first round in tournament history, and the lowest overall since 1946, before the shot clock rule was introduced. The Delta Devils' 19.7% shooting set another record for lowest shooting percentage in a game in tournament history.\nElsewhere in the West, third seed Xavier avoided an upset by 14th-seeded Georgia, coming back from nine down at the half to win 73–61. They were to play sixth-seeded Purdue next, who scored their tenth-straight first-round win by defeating the 11th seeded Baylor 90–79. Brigham Young, an eighth seed, lost to ninth-seeded Texas A&amp;M 67–62. The Cougars suffered early, not scoring until about the 14-minute mark, but managed to bring the game to a tie at the half. Twenty-six points by Aggie forward Josh Carter, however, made the difference in Texas A&amp;M's win. Lastly, West Virginia, seventh seed in the region, defeated tenth seed Arizona 75–65, scoring 11 three-point shots. With the win, the Mountaineers broke Arizona's streak of twenty straight 20-win seasons, previously the longest streak in the nation.\nSecond round.\nSeventh-seeded West Virginia began the second round of the tournament by defeating Duke, the second seed, 73–67. The Mountaineers trailed until about eight minutes into the second half, when they took a 43–40 lead. They outrebounded the Blue Devils 47–27, which, combined with several three-point shots, aided in the win. This loss marked Duke's second consecutive loss before the Sweet Sixteen round. West Virginia's Sweet Sixteen opposition in Phoenix, Arizona, was #3 Xavier, who defeated Purdue, 85–78. Xavier trailed as late as the 5:30 mark of the second half, but a widespread showing of talent from the Musketeers proved too difficult to stop, as four Xavier players scored in double figures, with two more tied at eight points each. Later that day, the top-seeded UCLA Bruins defeated ninth-seeded Texas A&amp;M, 51–49. The Bruins trailed by as much as ten early in the first half, but slowly chipped away at the lead as the half progressed. The winning basket was scored with 9.5 seconds left on a lay-up by Darren Collison. Texas A&amp;M had one final chance to tie it, but Donald Sloan's drive to the basket was stopped by two UCLA players (pictures show that they both appear to be grabbing Sloan, in what could have been a foul called on UCLA). The ensuing dunk by UCLA's Russell Westbrook was later waved off by officials as occurring after time had expired, making the final score 51–49. The Bruins then played WKU, a #12 seed who beat #13 seed San Diego by a 73–62 score. San Diego trailed by as much as 15 in the second half, but an 18–2 run gave them a one-point lead with minutes remaining. WKU, however, managed to pull ahead once again for the win, making this tournament only the third in history to feature at least two 12-or-lower seeds in the Sweet 16.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nXavier, the third seed in the West, defeated seventh seed West Virginia, 79–75 in overtime thanks to two B.J. Raymond three-pointers in the final 78 seconds. Raymond scored all eight of his points in the bonus round after being held scoreless in regulation, and poor free-throw shooting by the Mountaineers, missing four out of six free throws, sealed the victory. Josh Duncan led the Musketeers in scoring with a career-high 26 points, followed by Joe Alexander's 18 points and 10 rebounds. Xavier led by as much as 18 during the game, but trailed six late in OT, counting on Raymond's threes to give them the victory. Number one seed UCLA would play the Musketeers in the final, after outlasting 12th seeded WKU, 88–78. WKU came to within four late in the game, taking advantage of several sloppy Bruin mistakes. Kevin Love led UCLA with 29 points and 14 rebounds, aided by James Keefe's 18 points and 12 rebounds and Russell Westbrook's 14 and 11. Trailing 41–20 at the half, WKU came out of the locker room determined to win, as evidenced by Hilltopper star Tyrone Brazelton's 31 points, 25 of which came in the second half. A. J. Slaughter missed a crucial three-point shot that would have brought them to within one, and a UCLA run left them nine points behind only two minutes later.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nUCLA was the first team to advance to the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas, the third straight year and the 18th time in school history they have done it, with a 76–57 victory over Xavier. Kevin Love led the Bruins with 19 points and ten rebounds, tied as high scorer with Darren Collison. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute contributed 13 points and 13 rebounds. Derrick Brown led the Musketeers with 13 points. Overall, Xavier was held to 36% shooting from the floor while UCLA shot 56.8%. Love was picked as the West Region's MOP.\nFinal Four.\nFor the first time (and currently the only time) since the current seeding system started in 1979, all four #1 seeds made it to the Final Four.\nMemphis vs. UCLA.\nMemphis became the first team ever to win 38 games in one season by defeating UCLA 78–63 (Kentucky would match that record in 2012 and 2015). Chris Douglas-Roberts, who scored a game-high of 28 points, combined with Derrick Rose to score a total of 53 of Memphis' 78 points. UCLA star Kevin Love was held to 12 points, and the Bruins lost their second straight Final Four game. Memphis had lost to Ohio State in the Alamodome in the 2007 tournament, and had made it a goal to win in the arena in this year's tournament.\nKansas vs. North Carolina.\nThe second semifinal was a highly anticipated matchup between North Carolina Head Coach Roy Williams and the team he had coached for 15 years before leaving to go to UNC. The game itself could be divided up as if it were three different games. The Jayhawks took a 40–12 lead in the first 15 minutes, causing CBS analyst Billy Packer to declare that the game was over. North Carolina narrowed the deficit to 17 at halftime on a 15–4 run and opened the second half on a 23–10 run to close to within 4 points with 11 minutes to play. After the teams traded baskets for a few minutes, Kansas pulled away, closing on a 20–7 run for an 84–66 victory. After Kansas went out to the 40–12 lead, North Carolina never held the ball with a chance to take the lead. Brandon Rush led the Jayhawks with 25 points. AP Player of the Year Tyler Hansbrough scored 17 points and had 9 rebounds, both below his season averages. The Tar Heels were led by Wayne Ellington's 18 points.\nNational Championship Game.\nThe National Championship Game pitted Memphis against Kansas. The head coaches (KU's Bill Self and Memphis' John Calipari) had both been on the coaching staff of Kansas' 1986 Final Four team. Neither had garnered a national championship to this point in their head coaching careers. Memphis guard Chris Douglas-Roberts had been the leading scorer in the tournament, averaging 23.6 points per game. Memphis became the first team currently from a conference other than the six majors to play in the championship game since 1998. Utah advanced to the championship game in 1998, and UNLV was the last team from a non-major conference to win the national title in 1990.\nOn the day of the game, the betting lines set by Las Vegas casinos Las Vegas Hilton, Station Casinos, and The Mirage made Memphis the favorite by a spread of 2 points.\nThe first half was back-and-forth as Kansas led for 7:37 minutes and Memphis led for 6:51 minutes. Kansas led 33–28 at halftime, the first second-half deficit that Memphis faced in the entire tournament. Memphis scored the first five points of the second half to tie the score at 33 with 18:57 left in regulation. After that Kansas maintained a small lead from the 16:04 mark until Memphis retook the lead with 8:11 remaining. Memphis then went on a 10–0 run to build a seven-point lead with 5:10 remaining and increased it to nine points with 2:12 remaining in regulation.\nKansas strategically fouled Memphis—an extremely poor free throw shooting team all season—which missed four of its final five free throws in regulation while Kansas furiously scored 12 points in the final two minutes of regulation. During that stretch Kansas made 100% of their shots going 2 for 2 from two-point range, 2 for 2 from three-point range and 2 for 2 from the free throw line. When Memphis failed to foul, which arguably would have all but assured a victory for the Tigers, Kansas guard Mario Chalmers hit a three-point basket with 2.1 seconds remaining to tie the game at 63, sending the game into overtime. Kansas fans now refer to this shot as Mario's Miracle. At the end of regulation, the Jayhawks had led the score a total of 17:55 minutes and Memphis 15:51 minutes.\nIn overtime, Kansas scored the first six points en route to a 75–68 win. They continued the blistering stretch they started in regulation, going 4 of 6 from the field and 4 of 4 from the line in overtime. It was KU's third NCAA title since the modern tournament began in 1939 (fifth national title overall, including two Helms decisions). It was also the first national championship for the program since the 1988 team.\nThis was the seventh overtime National Championship Game in NCAA Division I tournament history and first since 1997. It also represented the first national title for the Big 12 Conference.\nThe national championship appearance by Memphis would later be vacated as a result of NCAA rules infractions.\nRecord by conference.\nThe columns R32, S16, E8, F4, CG, and NC respectively stand for the round of 32, Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, Championship Game, and National Champion.\nSixteen conferences—America East Conference, Atlantic Sun Conference, Big Sky Conference, Big South Conference, Big West Conference, Colonial Athletic Association, Ivy League, MAC, MEAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southland, SWAC, Summit League and WAC—went 0–1.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports.\nFor the 27th consecutive year, CBS Sports telecast the tournament, and for the 18th consecutive year, broadcast every game in the main bracket from the first round to the championship, as Jim Nantz and Billy Packer called the Final Four. ESPN carried the 64th-seed opening-round game between Coppin State and Mount St. Mary's on March 18, with Brent Musburger, Steve Lavin and Erin Andrews serving as the announcing team, as the network has done the opening-round game since 2002.\nThe complete list of announcing teams follows:\nGreg Gumbel once again served as the studio host, joined by analysts Clark Kellogg and Seth Davis. For the first time since the rights were acquired, the host team spent the entire tournament at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and did not travel to the Final Four site. CBS cited budget cutbacks ordered by the parent company, CBS Corporation. This would be Billy Packer's 35th and final tournament as a broadcaster, ending a streak that began in 1975; in July 2008, it was announced that Kellogg would replace Packer as Nantz's color man in 2009.\nSeveral affiliates showed additional games on digital subchannels, and once, the Los Angeles area had simultaneous telecasts on two stations: On March 20, UCLA vs. Mississippi Valley State was shown on KCBS and Cal State Fullerton vs. Wisconsin was on independent station KDOC at the same time. (KCBS has a duopoly with KCAL, but KCAL was unavailable because of a third basketball game, one between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.)\nCBS College Sports Network.\nSibling cable network CBS College Sports Network (now known as CBS Sports Network) picked up one CBS TV broadcast on each of the first two days of the tournament. It aired the Stanford-Cornell contest from Anaheim on March 20, and the St. Joseph's-Oklahoma game on March 21.\nUnlike CBS Sports on the broadcast side, CBS College Sports Network did send a team to San Antonio, with Blackburn anchoring coverage and hosting the postgame highlights show, called the \"NCAA March Madness Highlights Show\". Earlier, Greg Amsinger had hosted the postgame program from the network's studios at Chelsea Piers in lower Manhattan. Analysts included Steve Lappas, Greg Anthony, and Jay Williams.\nRadio.\nRadio broadcasts were once again being handled again by CBS subsidiary Westwood One, hosted by Tommy Tighe.\nFinal Four.\nKugler called his first Final Four replacing Harlan, with Raftery and Thompson on color commentary and Jim Gray as sideline reporter.\nOther media.\nDirecTV once again offered NCAA Mega March Madness as a pay-per-view package for one payment of US$69. This allowed access to all tournament games in the first three rounds of the main draw not shown on the local CBS station in the viewer's area. This package was exclusive to DirecTV and not available to Dish Network, fiber optic, or cable subscribers.\nOnline, CBSSports.com and NCAA.com teamed up for NCAA March Madness on Demand. Computer users with broadband connections were able to watch all tournament games from the first round to the championship game for free, thanks to advertiser support from Coca-Cola, AT&amp;T Mobility, Pontiac, and various other companies. The ads were not the same as those shown on television, and there was a separate halftime show hosted by Jason Horowitz joined by analysts including St. John's head basketball coach Norm Roberts."

        "text": "Rugby Ralph Lauren was an American clothing brand launched in 2004 under the management of parent company Polo Ralph Lauren, the line has been retired. The brand specialised in Preppy/Rugby inspired lifestyle apparel for male and female clientele ages 16 through 25. Rugby also encompassed Rugby Food &amp; Spirits, a small café modeled after the brand and offering dining inspired by the Rugby theme. Rugby merchandise was available at twelve stores throughout the United States, as well as one in Covent Garden in London, UK. By August, 2008 merchandise was also available online at Rugby.com.\nIn November 2012, it was announced that Ralph Lauren would be ending the Rugby line by February 2013. On February 5, the Rugby.com website was closed with only links to Ralph Lauren.com remaining.\nBrand history and identity.\nRugby Ralph Lauren was a concept created by luxury lifestyle apparel designer, Ralph Lauren. The brand's first location opened at 342 Newbury Street in Boston, Massachusetts on October 23, 2004. Rugby's lower price point and edgier styling catered to a younger shopper than Lauren's other luxury clothing brands. Though the company experimented with logos, most of the clothing either carried a small embroidered rugby player, \"R.L.F.C\", or a skull and crossbones motif. Similarly, the brand adopted its signature colours of yellow and navy stripes on its shopping bags, tags and other promotional material.\nTying in with the brand name, the staple of the concept was the rugby shirt. Originally, these rugby shirts were created in the school colors in the college towns that the Rugby stores resided. Rugby also had a full book of patches that customers could purchase to personalize their rugby shirt in-store.\nThe full brand lineup consisted of rugby shirts, polos, jackets, suits, dresses, outerwear and accessories, all with a distressed or embellished flair, as well as Rugby Ralph Lauren signature Rugby Football shirts that could be customized by buying patches in-store. Typically, there were also multiple luxury items in each line such as leather jackets and blazers.\nStore locations.\nRugby was available through its network of stores or on its website RUGBY.com. The brand held eleven stores and one flagship. Stock was also available in limited quantities in Ralph Lauren Outlet stores.\nStore locations.\nAll of these locations were closed by February 2013, when the brand ceased trading.\nA promotional rugby football was produced and used as a display in the stores. On it was written on the blue side, Ralph Lauren, the other blue side ESTABD 2004 and on both yellow sides of the football RUGBY. This football was located at the Boston store on Newbury Street, Boston, MA."

This was the first year the field was expanded to 64 teams, from 53 in the previous year's tournament. It began on March 14, 1985, and ended with the championship game on April 1 in Lexington, Kentucky. A total of 63 games were played.\nEighth-seed Villanova, coached by Rollie Massimino, won their first national title with a 66–64 victory in the final game over Georgetown, coached by John Thompson. Ed Pinckney of Villanova was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The game, often cited as \"The Perfect Game\", is widely considered among the greatest upsets in college basketball history, and is the second biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history. This Villanova team remains the lowest-seeded team to win the tournament. The Wildcats are also notable as the last Division I men's national champion to date to represent a school that did not sponsor varsity football at the time of its title (Villanova had dropped football after the 1980 season and did not reinstate the sport until the 1985 season, the first after the championship game). The game is also notable as the last played without a shot clock.\nThis year's Final Four saw an unprecedented and unmatched three teams from the same conference, with Big East members Villanova and Georgetown joined by St. John's. The only \"interloper\" in the Big East party was Memphis State, then of the Metro Conference (Memphis State's 1985 Final Four appearance was vacated due to using ineligible players, as were all of its tournament appearances from 1982 to 1986). Lehigh, champion of the East Coast Conference Tournament, became the first team in NCAA Tournament history to compete with a record below .500, as they were 12–18 at the time they played in the First Round.\nThis was also the first year that one of the regionals was named \"Southeast\", replacing \"Mideast\". This name was used until 1998, when the regional was renamed \"South\". This was also the last tournament until 2010 to feature two private schools in the title game. This tournament was also the last until 2012 to feature no teams in the Sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones.\nThis tournament's East Region is the only one in NCAA Tournament history in which the higher-seeded team won every game.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1985 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports\nESPN and NCAA Productions\nRadio.\nRegionals.\nCBS Radio"

A total of 63 games were played.\nIndiana, coached by Bob Knight, won the national title with a 74–73 victory in the final game over Syracuse, coached by Jim Boeheim. Keith Smart of Indiana, who hit the game-winner in the final seconds, and intercepted the full court pass at the last second, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThe tournament also featured a \"Cinderella team\" in the Final Four, as Providence College, led by a then-unknown Rick Pitino, made their first Final Four appearance since 1973.\nOne year after reaching the Final Four as a #11 seed, LSU made another deep run as a #10 seed in the Midwest region. The Tigers ousted #2 seed Temple in the second round and #3 seed DePaul in the Sweet 16 before losing 77-76 to top seeded Indiana in the Elite Eight.\nThis was the last tournament in which teams were allowed to have home court advantage: national runner-up Syracuse (2E), DePaul (3MW), Arizona (10W) and UAB (11SE) all opened the tournament playing on their home courts. UAB and Arizona each lost in the first round, while DePaul won twice at the Rosemont Horizon. Under rules adopted in 1988, teams cannot play in a facility in which they play four or more regular season games.\nThe 1987 NCAA men's basketball tournament was also the first tournament to use the three-point shot.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1987 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nCBS Studio Hosts:\nESPN studio hosts:"

The 50th annual edition of the tournament began on March 17, 1988, and ended with the championship game on April 4 returning to Kansas City for the 10th time. A total of 63 games were played.\nKansas, coached by Larry Brown, won the national title with an 83–79 victory in the final game over Big Eight Conference rival Oklahoma, coached by Billy Tubbs. As of 2023, this was the last national championship game to feature two schools from the same conference. Danny Manning of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Even though the Final Four was contested from its campus in Lawrence, Kansas, Kansas was considered a long shot against the top rated Sooners because Oklahoma had previously defeated the Jayhawks twice by 8 points that season—at home in Norman, Oklahoma and on the road in Kansas' Allen Fieldhouse. Kansas's upset was the third biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history. After this upset, the 1988 Kansas team was remembered as \"Danny and the Miracles.\"\nThis was the first NCAA Tournament which barred teams from playing on their home courts, or in any facility in which it played four or more regular season games. The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee made this change after each of the previous two Final Fours featured a team which played its first and second-round games at home: LSU in 1986 (as a No. 11 seed) and Syracuse in 1987.\nThe team which was arguably hurt the most by the change was North Carolina, whose Dean Smith Center hosted for the first (and as of 2023, only) time. The Tar Heels were a No. 2 seed, but with the hosting ban now in effect, they were shipped to the West, where they were routed in the regional final by top seed Arizona. Archrival Duke was the No. 2 seed in the East and won its first two games at Chapel Hill on its way to the Final Four.\nArizona, now known as a prominent basketball powerhouse, made their debut in this year's Final Four, marking the 80th different school (including official NCAA vacations; 78th otherwise) to do so. This is notable because Arizona's Final Four appearance was the first by a new school since the 1983 tournament, the longest gap at that point.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1988 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nTeams.\n(#) Kentucky was later stripped of its two NCAA tournament wins due to an ineligible player.\nBracket.\nSoutheast Regional – Birmingham, Alabama.\n(#) Kentucky was later stripped of its two NCAA tournament wins due to an ineligible player.\nAnnouncers.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports\nESPN and NCAA Productions"

It began on March 16, 1989, and ended with the championship game on April 3 in Seattle. A total of 63 games were played.\nMichigan, coached by Steve Fisher, won the national title with an 80–79 overtime victory in the final game over Seton Hall, coached by P. J. Carlesimo. Glen Rice of Michigan set an NCAA tournament record by scoring 184 points in six games and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nJust prior to the start of this tournament, Michigan coach Bill Frieder had announced that he would accept the head coaching position at Arizona State University at the end of the season. Michigan athletic director Bo Schembechler promptly fired Frieder and appointed top assistant Fisher as interim coach, stating famously, that \"a Michigan man is going to coach a Michigan team.\"\nTwo 16-seeded teams came within one point of victory in the first round (Georgetown vs. Princeton, Oklahoma vs. East Tennessee State), and a third came within six points. This tournament was also unusual in that all four 11-seeds advanced out of the first round.\nThe 1989 Tournament was the second one since 1980, with 1987 being the first, in which the defending national champion did not participate in the tournament. Kansas, winner of the 1988 NCAA title, had been placed on probation for violations committed by former coach Larry Brown and was barred from the tournament. Brown left Kansas immediately after winning the national championship to return to coaching in the NBA with the San Antonio Spurs, leaving first-year coach Roy Williams to coach the team. It is the only time the Jayhawks have missed the NCAA tournament from 1984 to the present day. The defending champion would not be left out of the next year's tournament again until 2008. The tournament was notable for the poor performance of the SEC. After traditional stalwart Kentucky missed the postseason after experiencing its first losing season since 1927, none of the five SEC teams won a game in the tournament.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1989 tournament, and their hosts:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports\nESPN and NCAA Productions\nRadio.\nFirst and second rounds.\nCBS Radio\nLegacy.\nThe story of the Wolverines' success was cited as inspiration in another sport. When the Spain national football team manager Julen Lopetegui was sacked days before the 2018 FIFA World Cup started after agreeing to join Real Madrid after the tournament, Spanish defender Gerard Piqué drew parallels with Michigan's NCAA win amid similar circumstances. Unfortunately, Spain failed to advance beyond the round of 16 while France won the tournament."

A total of 63 games were played.\nUNLV, coached by Jerry Tarkanian, won the national title with a 103–73 victory in the final game over Duke, coached by Mike Krzyzewski. In doing so, UNLV set the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament record for largest margin of victory in a championship game. UNLV's win marks the last time a school from a non-power conference has won the championship game. Anderson Hunt of UNLV was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThis tournament is also remembered for an emotional run by Loyola Marymount in the West regional. In the quarterfinals of the West Coast Conference tournament against the Portland Pilots, Lions star forward Hank Gathers collapsed and died due to a heart condition. The WCC tournament was immediately suspended, with the regular-season champion Lions given the conference's automatic bid. The team defeated New Mexico State, then laid a 34-point thrashing on defending national champion Michigan, and defeated Alabama in the Sweet Sixteen (the only game in which Loyola Marymount did not score 100 or more points in the tournament) before running into eventual champion UNLV in the regional final. Gathers' childhood friend Bo Kimble, the team's undisputed floor leader in the wake of the tragedy, paid tribute to his friend by attempting his first free throw in each game left-handed despite being right-handed. (Gathers was right-handed, but struggled so much with free throws that he tried shooting them left-handed for a time.) Kimble made all of his left-handed attempts in the tournament.\nThe tournament employed a new timing system borrowed from FIBA &amp; the NBA: when the game was played in an NBA arena, the final minute of the period is measured in tenths-seconds, rather than whole seconds as in previous years.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1990 tournament, and their host(s):\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nCBS and NCAA Productions broadcast all tournament games.\nCBS\nESPN/NCAA Productions.\nThis would be the last year that ESPN would be involved in broadcasting games of the tournament, as CBS took over exclusive coverage of the tournament the following year."

A total of 63 games were played.\nDuke, coached by Mike Krzyzewski, won a rematch of the previous year's national final matchup against undefeated UNLV 79–77 in the semifinal, then won the national title with a 72–65 victory in the final game over Kansas, coached by Roy Williams. This was the first national championship game for Williams as a head coach. Kansas defeated Williams' mentor Dean Smith and North Carolina (where Williams later coached) in the semifinal. Kansas made its second trip to the national championship game in four seasons, the prior appearance being 1988 when they defeated Oklahoma. Christian Laettner of Duke was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThis tournament marked the first time a #15 seed upset a #2 seed since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985, when Richmond accomplished against Syracuse in the East region. In addition, for the first time ever, at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won a first-round game.

Another 35 bids were awarded by the NCAA tournament committee at-large to the best teams in the nation not already qualified.\nThe Big Eight was eligible for an automatic bid to the tournament, but their conference tournament was won by Missouri, who were on probation and ineligible for the NCAA tournament. No automatic bid was awarded to the Big Eight.\nPlay-in Games.\nThe remaining three bids were decided by play-in games between the six lowest-rated conferences in the nation. These matchups, which were decided prior to the season, paired the tournament champions of the six lowest-rated conferences in the nation in games played at campus sites:\nUnlike the later Opening Round and First Four games, the play-in games were not considered part of the NCAA tournament. This meant that the winners of these games were not credited with an NCAA tournament win, and only the teams that advanced to the field of 64 were credited with an NCAA tournament appearance.\nAll three games were played on March 6, 1991.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nFive conference champions made their first NCAA tournament appearances: Coastal Carolina (Big South), Georgia State (TAAC), Green Bay (Mid-Continent), Saint Francis (PA) (NEC), and Saint Peter's (MAAC).\nBroadcast information.\nFor the first time, CBS Sports showed all 63 tournament games. In the first three rounds, games were shown on a regional basis, except for one game each on Saturday and Sunday in the second round. Usual start times were noon and 7:30 or 8 p.m. Eastern time on each of the Thursdays and Fridays. During the weekend of the second round, the national telecast began at noon, with the regional windows (three on Saturday, two on Sunday) following. Although the times would be adjusted, the same basic format was in place until 2010. As of 2011, the regional broadcasts have been replaced by simulcast feeds on non-broadcast networks owned by Turner Sports."

Grant Hill threw a pass the length of the court to Christian Laettner, who dribbled once, turned, and hit a jumper as time expired for the 104–103 win. \"Sports Illustrated\" deemed it the greatest college basketball game of all time, and ESPN ranked it No. 17 among the top 100 sports moments of the past 25 years (see ESPN25).

Donald Williams of North Carolina was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The most memorable play in the championship game came in the last seconds as Michigan's Chris Webber tried to call a timeout with his team down by 2 points when double-teamed by North Carolina. Michigan had already used all of its timeouts, so Webber's gaffe resulted in a technical foul. Michigan subsequently vacated its entire 1992–93 schedule, including its six NCAA Tournament games, after it emerged that Webber had received under-the-table payments from a booster.\nIn a game that featured two great individual battles (one between Bobby Hurley and Jason Kidd, and the other between Grant Hill and Lamond Murray), two-time defending champion Duke was upset in the second round by California.\nThis year's Final Four was the closest the tournament came to having all four top seeds advance to the semifinals until all four did advance in the 2008 tournament. Indiana was the only top seed not to make it out of its regional; it was defeated by the 2-seed Kansas, in the Midwest regional finals. This tournament is also notable for the uneven distribution of first-round upsets. While there were no upsets in the East, one 'minor' upset in the Midwest (9th seed Xavier defeated 8th seed New Orleans; Xavier was the betting favorite at all sports books in Las Vegas), and one 'medium' upset in the Southeast (11th seed Tulane beat 6th seed Kansas State), the West featured \"three\" remarkable upsets amongst the top 5 seeds, with a 12, a 13, and a 15-seed advancing to the second round in that region. At the time, 15-seed Santa Clara's victory over 2-seed Arizona was only the second such upset, and following the 2023 tournament, is one of only eleven times that a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams (In 2018, UMBC became one of only two 16-seeds to defeat a 1-seed, ousting Virginia 74-54, with Fairleigh Dickinson's upset of Purdue occurring five years later.).\nIn this tournament, the Louisiana Superdome was the only site in which the game clock counted down in whole seconds, not tenths of seconds, in the final minute of each period.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1993 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nTeams.\nThere were 30 automatic bids awarded to the tournament - of these, 27 were given to the winners of their conference's tournament, while three were awarded to the team with the best regular-season record in their conference (Big Ten, Ivy League and Pac-10).\nTwo conferences, the Great Midwest Conference and Trans America Athletic Conference, did not receive automatic bids to the tournament.\nTwo conference champions made their first NCAA tournament appearances: Tennessee State (Ohio Valley) and Wright State (Mid-Continent)."

It began on March 14, 1996, and ended with the championship game on April 1 at Continental Airlines Arena (now known as Meadowlands Arena) in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. A total of 63 games were played.\nThe Final Four venue was notable for several reasons:\nThe Final Four consisted of Kentucky, making its first appearance in the Final Four since 1993 and eleventh overall, Massachusetts, making its first ever appearance in the Final Four, Syracuse, making its third appearance in the Final Four and first since 1987, and Mississippi State, also making its first appearance.\nKentucky won its sixth national championship by defeating Syracuse in the final game 76–67.\nTony Delk of Kentucky was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Kentucky's run to the championship was one of the most dominant in NCAA tournament history, as the Wildcats won each of their first four games by at least 20 points and won every game by at least 7 points.\nMassachusetts, coached by John Calipari, was later stripped of its wins, including the UMass Minutemen's Final Four appearance, by the NCAA because UMass star Marcus Camby had accepted illegal gifts from agents. Connecticut, coached by Jim Calhoun, was additionally punished monetarily due to players accepting illegal gifts from agents.\nThe 1996 tournament was the last to feature teams from the Big Eight and Southwest Conferences; later that year the two would form the Big 12 Conference. As of 2022 they are the last Division I conferences to disband and/or merge after sending teams to the NCAA tournament.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1996 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nTeams.\nThere were 30 automatic bids awarded to the tournament - of these, 27 were given to the winners of their conference's tournament, while three were awarded to the team with the best regular-season record in their conference (Big Ten, Ivy League and Pac-10).\nTwo conferences, the American West Conference and Conference USA, did not receive automatic bids to the tournament.\nFour conference champions made their first NCAA tournament appearances: Monmouth (NEC), UNC Greensboro (Big South), Valparaiso (Mid-Continent), and Western Carolina (Southern).\nAnnouncers.\nNote: During the Midwest Regional Final in Minneapolis; sideline reporter Michele Tafoya temporarily substituted for Sean McDonough in the play-by-play booth when McDonough became ill; calling about 10 minutes of the first half before McDonough felt well enough to resume play-by-play; in the process making her the first woman to call part of an NCAA Men's Division I Tournament game."

For the second time in the last three seasons, the defending national champions reached the final game and lost.\nMiles Simon of Arizona was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nSeveral years later, Minnesota was stripped of its Final Four appearance following the discovery of NCAA academic rule violations. In addition, the Gophers were stripped of their Big Ten title they had also won.\nArizona also became the only school since the introduction of the 64-team bracket in 1985, to defeat three number 1 seeds in the tournament, having upset overall number one seed Kansas in addition to their two Final Four victories.\nThe tournament also saw the third victory by a #15 seed over a #2 seed, as Coppin State defeated South Carolina in their first round matchup. In addition, a #14 seed advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for only the second time, as Southeast Region #14 seed Chattanooga defeated both Georgia and Illinois.\nThe tournament marked the end of the career of North Carolina coach Dean Smith.

This Final Four was the first—and so far, only—to be held in a baseball-specific facility, as Tropicana Field is home to the Tampa Bay Rays (then known as the Devil Rays).\nThe Final Four consisted of Connecticut, making their first ever Final Four appearance; Ohio State, making their ninth Final Four appearance and first since 1968; Michigan State, making their third Final Four appearance and first since their 1979 national championship; and Duke, the overall number one seed and making their first Final Four appearance since losing the national championship game in 1994.\nIn the national championship game, Connecticut defeated Duke 77–74 to win their first ever national championship, snapping Duke's 32-game winning streak, and scoring the biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history. Duke nonetheless tied the record for most games won during a single season, with 37, which they co-held until Kentucky's 38-win seasons in 2011–12 and 2014–15. The 2007–08 Memphis team actually broke this record first, but the team was later forced to vacate their entire season due to eligibility issues surrounding the team.\nRichard \"Rip\" Hamilton of Connecticut was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. This was a significant victory for the program, as it cemented Connecticut's reputation as a true basketball power after a decade of barely missing the Final Four.\nThis tournament is also historically notable as the coming-out party for Gonzaga as a rising mid-major power.

The highest seeded of the other three Final Four teams was Florida, who won the East Region as the fifth seed. Two eight-seeds made the Final Four, with Wisconsin and North Carolina rounding the bracket out.

A total of 64 games were played.\nThis tournament is the first to feature 65 teams, due to the Mountain West Conference receiving an automatic bid for the first time. This meant that 31 conferences would have automatic bids to the tournament. The NCAA decided to maintain 34 at-large bids, which necessitated a play-in game between the #64 and #65 ranked teams, with the winner playing against a #1 seed in the first round. (Another option would have been to reduce the number of at-large bids to 33, which was the option chosen for the women's tournament.) This is also the first tournament to have been broadcast in high-definition, being broadcast on CBS.\nThis was the last tournament where the first- and second-round sites were tied to specific regionals.

The best remembered and most unexpected occurred when Hampton beat number 2 seed Iowa State 58–57 in the first round. The Pirates were down by as much as 11 in the game and outscored the Cyclones 10–0 in the final seven minutes of the game. Tarvis Williams made the winning shot with 6.9 seconds left. The video of Hampton coach Steve Merfield being lifted in the air by player David Johnson during the celebration has become a classic clip, often played by CBS and ESPN to showcase the excitement of the underdog in the NCAA tournament.\nHampton became only the fourth #15 seed to win a game since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 and the first since 1997. They went on to lose to Georgetown in the second round, failing to become the first seed that low to make the Round of 16.

        "title": "Bengal cricket team",
        "text": "In India, the Bengal cricket team represents the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) in domestic competition. Based at the historic Eden Gardens in Kolkata, they have played first-class cricket since 1935. Bengal have won the Ranji Trophy twice and been runners-up 13 times. They also play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy, both of which they have won once. Several international cricketers have played for the team including Dilip Doshi, Sourav Ganguly, Deep Dasgupta, Mohammed Shami, Pankaj Roy, and Wriddhiman Saha.\nHistory.\nThe Calcutta Cricket Club was founded in 1792 with membership restricted to Europeans. The team's earliest known match was reported 23 February 1792 in the \"Madras Courier\", Calcutta playing a team from Barrackpore and Dumdum. Eden Gardens was established as the club's home stadium in 1864. It had been a park called Auckland Circus Gardens, named after George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland, who was the Governor-General of India from 1836 to 1842. It was renamed Eden Gardens in 1841, in honour of Auckland's two sisters.\nFor the first time, a team representing Bengal was formed in December 1889 for a match against an English touring team at Eden Gardens. At that time, no native Bengalis were involved and the team, captained by British Army officer Cleveland Greenway, was composed of European colonials who were mostly British expatriates. Bengal lost the match, played over the New Year period, by an innings and 17 runs. In January 1923, a Bengal team took part in the Nagpur Provincial Tournament and, having defeated a Central Provinces XI in their semi-final, lost the final against Bombay. The Bengal team in this competition included a couple of native players but, as before, it was principally a colonial enterprise. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) was founded in 1928 and has governance of all cricket in West Bengal, including management of the Bengal team.\nIn 1934, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) organised the Ranji Trophy but Bengal did not take part in 1934–35. Bengal achieved first-class status in December 1935 when they played the Australian tourists. Bengal were captained by Alec Hosie and the team included Shute Banerjee. Although the Australian team on that tour was a mixed bag of veterans and fringe players, they easily defeated Bengal by 9 wickets.\nIn January 1936, Bengal joined the Ranji Trophy, playing in the East Zone, and reached the semi-final where they lost to Madras. In 1936–37, Bengal were runners-up to Nawanagar. Two years later, in 1938–39, Bengal won the Ranji for the first time when they defeated Southern Punjab in the final. Throughout this period, Bengal was essentially a West Bengal team. They were based in Calcutta and played all their matches at Eden Gardens. The earliest match of note in Dhaka was in February 1941 when a Bengal Governor's XI played the Bengal Gymkhana at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, then called the Dacca Stadium. Following Partition of India in 1947, Bengal was split into West (India) and East (then Pakistan, now Bangladesh).\nBengal won their second Ranji Trophy in 1989–90 when they defeated Delhi in the final. To 2023, In addition to their two titles, Bengal have been runners-up 13 times, most recently in 2022–23, and only Bombay/Mumbai have appeared in more finals.\nHaving won the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in 2011, Bengal won the Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2012. Playing under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly, they defeated Mumbai in the final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi on 12 March 2012.\nAuthor Mihir Bose, writing in 1990, commented that cricket's first secure foothold in India was Calcutta Cricket Club, founded 1792 and only five years younger than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Despite continuing enthusiasm for the sport in Bengal, it is overshadowed by Mumbai as \"the centre for Indian cricket\". Bose describes Eden Gardens as \"one of the great Test match centres of the world\", but he laments the relative lack of Bengali Test players saying that only \"a handful\" has played Test cricket.\nTo the end of 2023, Bengal have played in a total of 450 first-class matches, 446 of them in the Ranji Trophy. The exceptions are the team's inaugural first-class match against the 1935/36 Australians; Marylebone Cricket Club in December 1951; the Commonwealth XI in December 1953; and the 1990/91 Irani Cup against Rest of India.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n\"Updated as on 18 February 2024\".\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nNote - Mohammed Shami is also part of Bengal cricket team but has not played since 2019 due to national team duty or injuries.\nNotable former players.\nThe following Bengal cricketers hold team records or have made international appearances in Test, ODI or T20I matches.

The German Cricket Federation, which organises the team, has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1999, having previously been an affiliate member from 1991. The team made its international debut against Denmark in 1989, playing as West Germany. It has since played regularly in European Cricket Championship tournaments, as well as twice in the lower divisions of the World Cricket League. In 2001, Germany also competed in the ICC Trophy (now the World Cup Qualifier) for the first and only time. In 2022, they played their first T20 World Cup Global Qualifier.\nHistory.\nGermany became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1991. As West Germany, the country had played its first internationals in 1989, a two-match series against Denmark. The team made its international tournament debut in 1990, at the European Cricketer Cup in Guernsey. They hosted that tournament (which had been renamed the European Nations Cup) in 1996, playing against France, Portugal, and Sweden, and finished as runners up in the 1997 tournament after losing to France by one run in the final, the winning run being scored by David Bordes whilst he had a skull fracture. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later listed the final as one of the 100 best matches of the 20th century.\nIn 1998, Germany competed in the European Championship for the first time and finished seventh. They became an associate member of the ICC the following year and played in Division Two of the European Championship in 2000, finishing as runners-up to Gibraltar.\nThey played at the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, their first and, to date, only appearance in the ICC Trophy. They failed to progress beyond the first round and again finished as runners up to Gibraltar in Division Two of the European Championship the following year. They also played in Division Two in 2004, finishing third, and in 2006, again finishing third.\n2018–Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

        "text": "The Gibraltar national cricket team is the team that represents the British overseas territory of Gibraltar in international cricket. They have been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1969.\nGibraltar played in the ICC Trophy (now replaced by the ICC World Cup Qualifier) from 1982 to 2001, with little success. The team has played in the top-flight of the European Cricket Championship on four occasions, and placed sixth (out of eight teams) at 1996 European Cricket Championship held in Denmark in 1996. After the creation of the World Cricket League, Gibraltar was placed in the 2009 Division Seven. It was subsequently relegated to 2010 Division Eight, where another low finish saw the team again relegated, to regional qualifying tournaments.\nWith approximately 34,000 residents, Gibraltar has one of the smallest populations of any ICC member. Only three members, all fellow dependencies of ICC full members, have a smaller population – in order from largest to smallest, the Cook Islands, Saint Helena, and Falkland Islands.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket has been played in Gibraltar by British servicemen since the late 18th century. A cricket ground is known to have existed north of the Rock of Gibraltar in 1800. Civilians as well as servicemen were playing the game by 1822. The Gibraltar Cricket Club was formed in 1883, and formed the backbone of civilian cricket until well into the 20th century.\nIn 1890, a ship carrying the Australia national cricket team on the way to a tour of England, docked in Gibraltar Harbour after a collision with two other ships. The Australians played a game against a Gibraltar Garrison team. The Australians won the game, scoring 150/8, as the local side were dismissed for just 25.\nThe game was flourishing in the 1930s, with Gibraltar producing many locally born players. However, the Second World War meant a cut back in the game, with many cricket fields giving way to the military, one even being converted into an airfield.\nPost-war years.\nThe 1950s saw an increase in clubs, and the Gibraltar Cricket Association was formed in 1960. They were elected to associate membership of the ICC in 1969. Essex County Cricket Club visited after the conclusion of the 1973 English domestic season, and played a Rock XI in a one-day game, winning by 178 runs. Visits by English sides of various ability levels have continued ever since.\nIn 1982, Gibraltar took part in the second ICC Trophy, without winning a match. They improved on this performance in the 1986 tournament, gaining their first international win against Israel. They performed even better in the next tournament, beating East and Central Africa, Singapore and Israel reaching the plate competition. Israel toured Gibraltar in 1992, winning the match they played against the national side.\nGibraltar finished in 20th place in the 1994 ICC Trophy, and played in the first European Championship in Copenhagen in 1996, finishing sixth after losing to Scotland in a play-off. They finished 19th in the following years ICC Trophy and played poorly in the 1998 European Championship, finishing last in the ten team tournament.\nIn 1999, Gibraltar hosted a quadrangular tournament also involving France, Israel and Italy, losing in the final to Italy. The European Championship was split into two divisions in 2000, with Gibraltar placed in Division Two, which they won. The following year they travelled to Canada to take part in the 2001 ICC Trophy. A withdrawal by Italy and the non-arrival of West Africa left Gibraltar with just three matches to play against Germany, Namibia and Nepal, losing all of them and not progressing beyond the first round.\nGibraltar defended their European Division Two title in 2002, but could not continue this success in 2004, finishing fifth out of six teams. They did not qualify for the 2005 ICC Trophy, and finished fourth in Division Two of the European Championship in 2006 after losing a play-off to Germany.\nGibraltar placed sixth at the 2009 Global Division Seven tournament and was relegated to Division-eight.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Gibraltar and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status. \nGibraltar played their first T20I on 26 October 2019, against Portugal, during the 2019 Iberia Cup.\nGibraltar achieved a first T20I victory during the 2021 Valletta Cup in a match against Bulgaria. This win came on the back of a century from captain Avinash Pai accompanied by a half century from 16 year old Louis Bruce.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Gibraltar\n\"Last updated 15 October 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2317.

For the first time, the 4 × 100 metres medley relay was contested. The United States topped the medal standings with a total of 15 medals (9 gold), while Australia finished close second with 13 medals (5 gold). 16-years-old phenom Chris von Saltza won four medals, three of them gold.\n100m men's freestyle controversy.\nResults were decided by finish judges who relied on their eyes and did not use replays. Three judges were assigned to each finishing position. There were three official timers in 1960 for each lane and swimmer, all timing by hand. All three timers for Devitt, in lane three, timed him in 55.2 seconds. The three timers for lane four timed Lance Larson in 55.0, 55.1, and 55.1 seconds.\nFormer Olympic swimmer and FINA co-founder Max Ritter inspected the judge's scorecards. Two of the three first-place judges found that Devitt had finished first and the third found for Larson. Of the three-second-place judges, two found that Devitt finished second and one found that Larson was second. Ritter pointed out to chief judge Henry Runströmer of Sweden that the scorecards indicated a tie. Runstrümer cast the deciding vote and declared Devitt the winner. However, the rules at that time did not provide for the chief judge to have a vote or give him the right to break ties. Ties were supposed to be broken by referring to the timing machine. The official results placed Devitt first and Larson second, both with the identical time of 55.2 seconds. The United States team appealed, bolstered by videotaped footage of the finish that appeared to show Larson the winner. The appeal jury, headed by Jan de Vries, also the President of FINA in 1960, rejected the appeal, keeping Devitt the winner. This controversy would pave the way for electronic touchpads to be included in swimming events to determine finish and accurate timing.\nParticipating nations.\n380 swimmers from 45 nations competed."

After winning all their first-round matches against Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, they beat Kenya in the semi-final before losing by 270 runs to South Africa in the final.\nIn March 2004, they won the African affiliates qualifying tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy, qualifying them for the next stage of qualification, the Africa Cricket Association Championships. They beat Nigeria and Tanzania in that tournament in Zambia in August, finishing fourth, thus missing out on qualification for their first ICC Trophy. They were rewarded for their performance in this tournament by being promoted to associate membership of the ICC in 2005.\nIn 2006, they took part in Division Two of the African region of the World Cricket League, finishing second behind Tanzania. This qualified them for Division Five of the World Cricket League.\nIn May 2008, Botswana travelled to Jersey to take part in the Division Five tournament. Although Botswana beat the Bahamas in Group B, it was their only group stage win and with three losses and one match abandoned due to rain they failed to make the semi-finals. Botswana finished sixth overall after defeating Germany but losing to Singapore in positional playoff matches. With only the top two from this tournament qualifying for Division Four in Tanzania later in the year, Botswana missed out on the chance to take their 2011 World Cup dream any further.\nIn October 2008, Botswana took part in Division Two of the African region of the World Cricket League, finishing unbeaten and winning the tournament. This victory promoted them to Division One of the Africa Region.\nIn August 2009, Botswana travelled to Singapore to participate in Division Six of the World Cricket League. Despite being competitive in most of their games, Botswana won only one of five group matches and finished fifth after beating Norway in a positional playoff.\nIn May 2011, Botswana hosted the ICC World Cricket League Division Seven with a young squad and performed admirably well, winning three league stage matches against Norway, Japan and Germany but losing out to eventual champions Kuwait, 2nd placed Nigeria and finally Germany in the placing match. The match versus Nigeria in the league stages was to decide which of the 2 nations would progress to the ICC World Cricket League Division Six to be held in Malaysia in September 2011 and by losing that match, Botswana failed to progress and will remain in Division Seven till the next instalment of the ICC WCL.\nIn April 2013, Botswana were given hosting rights again for the ICC World Cricket League Division 7 in their second attempt in trying to get promoted out of Division 7 after halting the relegation slide in the last edition. Beating Ghana in the first match, Botswana lost their second match in a competitive encounter against Vanuatu by 23 runs. Botswana then lost third next match heavily to eventual WCL Div 7 winners and arch rivals Nigeria. Botswana tried in vain to get back into contention for promotion but after a tied match against Germany, all hopes were dashed and the best they could hope for was a third-place finish. This was achieved by beating Fiji in the last group match and then beating them again in the third-place playoff earning Botswana a third place, finishing behind Vanuatu and Nigeria who were both promoted to Division 6 of the WCL. With the ICC's decision to eliminate the ICC World Cricket League Divisions 7 and 8, Botswana will now have to qualify through regional tournaments to make it into the ICC World Cricket League Division 6, which will now be the entry point for the World Cricket League.\n2018–present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Botswana and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status. \nBotswana’s first T20I match was against Uganda on 20 May 2019, after finishing first in the Southern sub-region qualification group, advancing to the Regional Final of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Africa Qualifier tournament.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational match summary\n\"Last updated 19 December 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Botswana\nMost T20I wickets for Botswana\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2412.

Fiji has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1965, although the team's history goes back to the late 19th century.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Fiji and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nCricket was introduced to Fiji by European settlers in 1874, and the native population began taking up the game in 1878. The governor of Fiji at the time listed introducing cricket to the native Fijians as one of the achievements of his tenure in his memoirs.\nEarly tours.\nFiji was playing first-class cricket just 21 years after cricket was introduced to the country, when they toured New Zealand in early 1895.\n1895 tour of New Zealand.\nFiji's team on the tour in 1895 was captained by John Udal, whose great-grandson Shaun would eventually play Test cricket for England. The first match of the tour was a two-day match against Auckland, which Fiji lost by an innings.\nA low scoring second match against Otago was drawn after rain washed out the first of the two days. The third match against Canterbury was also lost by an innings, before a draw against Wellington.\nThe final two matches of the tour went much better for the Fijians, winning against Hawke's Bay by an innings after a century from John Collins, and beating Taranaki by two wickets.\n1907–08 tour of Australia.\nIn 1907–08, Fiji toured Australia, playing 26 matches against state, university and district sides between 11 December 1907 and 30 March 1908. In the drawn two-day match against Queensland, Pope Cakobau took 7 for 105 and 3 for 56. The Fijian team also played a two-day match against New South Wales and two against Victoria. All four of these matches were drawn.\n1923–24 New Zealand tour of Fiji.\nA New Zealand team captained by Walter Harvie, and consisting mostly of players from Auckland, toured Fiji in March and April 1924, playing five matches, including two three-day matches against Fiji. None of the matches were first-class.\n1935–36 New Zealand tour of Fiji.\nA young New Zealand team captained by Bruce Massey, known as the Maorilanders, toured Fiji in December 1935 and January 1936, playing nine matches, including two three-day matches against Fiji. None of the matches were first-class.\nPost War period.\nFiji toured New Zealand twice more, in 1948 and 1954. Fiji's first match against a Test-playing nation came in 1956, when the West Indies visited. Fiji won the match against a team featuring the likes of Garfield Sobers by 28 runs despite being bowled out for 91, largely thanks to a six wicket haul from John Gosling.\n1948 tour of New Zealand.\nLike the tour in 1895, the 1948 tour started with a defeat to Auckland, by 168 runs. Fiji won their next match against Wellington by one wicket, before losing to Canterbury by 36 runs.\nThe tour continued with a 46 run defeat by Otago and concluded with a 115 run win against Auckland. One notable player for Fiji on this tour was IL Bula, who scored the most runs and the only century on the tour. Bula's full name is Ilikena Lasarusa Talebulamainavaleniveivakabulaimainakulalakebalau, and his name is thought to be the longest of any first class cricketer.\n1954 tour of New Zealand.\nJust four matches were played on the 1954 tour, which started with a two wicket defeat to Otago. The tour continued with another two wicket defeat, this time to Canterbury, before a 117 run defeat to Wellington. The tour ended with a seven wicket win against Auckland. The team included Ratu Kamisese Mara who would go on to become the Prime Minister and President of Fiji.\n1983–84 England visit to Fiji.\nAn England XI played two limited-over matches against the Fiji Cricket Association President's XI in 1984. Basically this was the full England squad of the day on its way to tour New Zealand. The England side won both matches although they were given a serious scare in the second, the Fijian side losing by only 18 runs.\nICC membership.\nFiji gained associate membership of the ICC in 1965. They played in the first ICC Trophy tournament in 1979, and played in every one until 2001. They also played in the first ACC Trophy in 1996, losing in the semi-final to the UAE.\nIn 2001, Fiji played in the first Pacifica Cup in Auckland, reaching the final where they lost to the New Zealand Māori by three wickets. They played in the 2002 tournament in Samoa, finishing third after beating the Cook Islands in a play-off.\nIn 2003, Fiji hosted the South Pacific Games. The cricket tournament saw the hosts lose to Papua New Guinea in the final. The following year, they took part in the EAP Challenge in Fuji City, Japan, winning after beating Tonga in the final. This qualified them for the repêchage tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy. At that tournament in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, they reached the final, where they lost to Papua New Guinea by 30 runs, thus missing out on the 2005 ICC Trophy.\nIn 2006, Fiji played in the 2006 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy in Brisbane, Australia. They won the tournament winning all of their matches against the Cook Islands and Japan, qualifying them for Division Three of the World Cricket League in Darwin, Australia. They warmed up for the tournament with a three match series at home against Vanuatu, winning all three matches, but were unsuccessful in the tournament itself, losing all five games they played, thus meaning they will have to take part in Division Four in 2008.\nLater in 2007, they took part in the cricket tournament at the 2007 South Pacific Games, losing to Papua New Guinea in the final group game, meaning that they went home with the silver medal.\nFiji took part in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Five in Nepal, where they finished sixth and last and in doing so failed to win a single match in the tournament. Fiji then played in the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Six and finished sixth and last and in doing so were relegated to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Seven.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Fiji\n\"Last updated 18 March 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2029.

Nat Uluiviti is the other Fijian to have played first-class cricket for a team other than Fiji, playing for Auckland in the 1950s.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Fiji squad at the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Six tournament was as follows:"

        "text": "The France national cricket team is the men's team that represents the country of France in international cricket. They became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998, having previously been an affiliate member since 1987. The country is best known for winning the silver medal in the cricket event at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, the only time cricket has been held at the Olympics. France now plays most of its matches in European Cricket Council (ECC) tournaments, although the team also appeared at the 2001 ICC Trophy.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between France and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nOne of the many theories about the origin of cricket is that France could be a possible birthplace of the game: a mention of a bat and ball game called \"criquet\" in a village of the Pas-de-Calais occurs in a French manuscript of 1478, and \"criquet\" is an old French word meaning \"post\" or \"wicket\". However, it is also possible that this could be an early variant of croquet.\nHorace Walpole, son of former British Prime Minister Robert Walpole mentioned seeing cricket in Paris in 1766.\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were due to make the first ever international cricket tour of France, in 1789, however this was cancelled due to the French Revolution. This match was finally played in 1989, as part of the bicentennial celebrations of the revolution, with France beating the MCC by 7 wickets.\nThe first documented match took place in the Bois de Boulogne between Paris Cricket Club and Nottingham Amateurs in 1864. The Paris Cricket Club published a book explaining the game the following year.\nOlympic Games.\nThe first, and so far only, appearance of cricket at the Olympic Games took place in 1900, with the French team losing the only match played to Great Britain: France therefore remain the reigning silver medalist until 2028, when cricket will return to the Olympic Games (in the Twenty20 format).\nThe French team, however, consisted of ten British residents in Paris and two Frenchmen, members of the Standard Athletic Club. The match was twelve-a-side, and the following players represented France:\nThe Standard Athletic Club restaged the 1900 Olympic cricket match in 1987, and France played the MCC in Meudon in 1989.\nIn 1910, France took part in an exhibition tournament in Brussels, also involving the MCC, the Netherlands and Belgium. They played one game, against the Netherlands, winning by 63 runs.\nThe modern era.\nMany cricket clubs folded after the Second World War, but an influx of English and Asian immigrants led to a resurgence of the game in the early 1980s. The current French Cricket Association was formed in 1987, and they gained Affiliate membership of the ICC the same year.\nAfter the win in the 1989 match mentioned above, there were a handful of tours from English county teams, and France toured Austria in 1996, losing both matches against the national team. In 1997, they played in the European Nations Cup in Zuoz, Switzerland, winning after beating Germany by one run in the final. This match was included in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack list of 100 best matches of the 20th century as David Bordes ran the winning leg bye with a fractured skull.\nThey played in the European Championship in the Netherlands in 1998, finishing eighth after losing to Germany in a play-off. They became an associate member of the ICC the same year. They finished third in Division Two of the 2000 European Championship.\nFrance played their only ICC Trophy in the 2001 tournament in Canada, though they did not progress beyond the first round. The following year, they finished fifth in Division Two of the European Championships, and finished as runners up in the 2004 tournament. They finished sixth in the 2006 tournament after losing a play-off to Guernsey.\nIn 2008, France finished fourth in Division 2 of the European Championship. In 2010, France finished third in the same competition, narrowly missing out on qualification for the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Eight. In 2011, they finished sixth in the ICC Europe Division 1 T20 Championship after losing the fifth place play-off match to Norway. In 2012, they finished second in the ICC European World Cricket League 8 Qualifier, held in La Manga, Spain; again missing out on qualification for Division 8 of the World Cricket League.\nIn 2018, France competed at the ICC World Twenty20 Europe Region Qualifier in Netherlands.\nIn 2021, France played their first ever T20 international match against Norway in a tri-nation series in Germany, winning the match by 4 wickets.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational match summary — France\n\"Last updated 16 July 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2143.

        "text": "The New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA) is one of the seven conferences affiliated with the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) that schedule and administer regattas within their established geographic regions.\nNEISA is one of the oldest and largest conferences, organizing intercollegiate sailing in New England, which includes 42 member schools including club teams and varsity programs. All conferences host their own 6 conference championships every year and gain berths to the corresponding national championships based on conference size. NEISA is managed by an executive board run primarily by student volunteers and team coaches.\nHistory.\nThe New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 26, 1949. This group of initially 21 teams joined with the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and later the Midwest College Sailing Association and Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association to form the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association of North America. This Association worked to standardize rules and create entry and eligibility regulations, as well as broaden the scope of its competitions.\nFrom the beginning of college sailing, all regattas have been sailed in the host school's fleet of boats. Early on there was little consistency in the type of boat across different parts of the country and even between neighboring schools. Over time however, many schools have transitioned from various single-sail dinghies to use more durable and faster two-sail boats such as the FJ and Club 420.\nLeadership.\nNEISA is a largely run and regulated by in-conference coaches and sailors. Members of the Executive Committee are elected annually at the NEISA Annual Meeting held late Fall. There is currently no term-limit for Executive Committee members. As of Spring, 2019 the Executive Committee was as follows.\nChampionships.\nNEISA runs and hosts six in-conference championships, as well as sends teams to national championship events managed by the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.\nIn-conference Championships.\nFor Coed teams, these in-conference championships include:\nFor Women's teams, these in-conference championships include:\nNational Championships.\nFor full article on national sailing championships, see Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Championships\nThe number of berths NEISA teams are given to national championships depend on the event and are determined by ICSA at the beginning of every Year. As NEISA is one of the largest conferences, it is annually given more berths than the smaller conferences. The representing teams from NEISA are determined by the corresponding In-Conference Championships.\nThese national championships include:\nResults and Rankings.\nSince 2008, Inter-collegiate racing results are documented using College Sailing Techscore, a website which records live race results for current regattas, as well as documents past seasons. NEISA also creates in-conference team rankings every Fall based on the best regatta results of each team and the relative difficulty/ size of the regattas those results came from. A team's score is calculated by summing their top 5 scoring regattas and also their score at the New England Fall Championships. These scores are compiled to rank all participating teams. Teams that are not listed on the rankings did not sail a scored regatta during that Season. "

        "text": " is a one to four-player NES/arcade game released by SNK in 1988.\nSummary.\nThe player can choose between four different golfers with varying advantages and disadvantages. Lee Trevino (who lent his endorsement to this North American NES version of the game) is playable (only in the North American version) as a character named Super Mex (an actual nickname of his; the Japanese version uses a character named Birdie Tommy in place of Trevino himself); other characters include Pretty Amy/Eri, Miracle Chosuke and Big Jumbo. Pretty Amy has limited range, but the easiest control (\"control\" refers to the length of the aiming guide). Miracle Chosuke and Super Mex have average attributes. Big Jumbo has the best range, but the worst control. Despite the title, no fighting is involved in the game. The player has to avoid sand traps, water hazards, rough ground and trees.\nThe courses range from relatively straightforward fairways to elaborate arrangements of sand traps. The two courses available for play are the United States, which consists of mostly bunkers and super rough, and the Japan course, consisting of water and tight boundaries. The United States course is modeled after PGA West Stadium Course.\nAt the end of the game, the player is greeted with a photorealistic shot of the country club lodge against the setting sun and surrounded by trees.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf\" on their May 1, 1988 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.\n\"GameRevolution\" ranked this game as #23 on the 50 Worst Video Game Names of All Time list.\nLegacy.\nThe game was parodied in the season 7 episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Marge Be Not Proud\", with the game in the episode called \"Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge\". The episode mocks how boring and mundane golf video games are and during the credits, Bart is seen playing the game and making decisions against Carvallo's suggestions to try to make the game fun (using a three wood club instead of Carvallo's suggested putter and entering the force of his swing as \"power drive\" instead of Carvallo's suggested \"feather touch\", the end result of which is that the ball is sent flying into a parking lot), yet he ends up getting bored fast and quits playing."

        "title": "James Neal (ice hockey)",
        "text": "James Neal (born September 3, 1987) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He has previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Dallas Stars, Pittsburgh Penguins, Nashville Predators, Vegas Golden Knights, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, and St. Louis Blues. \nWhile playing junior ice hockey with the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), he was selected in the second round, 33rd overall, by the Dallas Stars in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. After one season with the Stars' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Iowa Stars, Neal played his NHL rookie year with Dallas in 2008–09. During his third NHL season, he was traded to the Penguins, where he played four seasons before being traded to the Predators. \nAfter three seasons with the Predators, Neal was selected in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft by the Golden Knights. A free agent after one year in Vegas, Neal signed with the Flames in July 2018 before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers just over a year later, where he played two seasons.\nPlaying career.\nMinor.\nNeal started in the CYO in Oshawa, grew up playing minor ice hockey for the Whitby Wildcats of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA)'s Eastern AAA League. He played in the 2001 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with Whitby. Among his minor hockey coaches was NHL and TSN broadcaster Bob McKenzie. His father, Peter, coached him for the major part of his minor hockey career. After his midget season, he was selected by the Plymouth Whalers in the third round, 80th overall, of the 2003 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection. Before joining the major junior ranks, he was assigned to the Bowmanville Eagles, a Junior A club of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), for the 2003–04 season.\nJunior.\nFollowing his rookie season in the OHL, Neal was selected in the second round, 33rd overall, of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars. Competing in his first NHL training camp, the Stars returned him to junior, where he recorded 21 goals and 58 points with Plymouth in 2005–06. Although Neal was returned again to junior following the Stars' 2006 training camp, he was signed by the club to a three-year, entry-level contract in late October 2006. He recorded a junior career-high 27 goals and 65 points over 45 games in 2006–07. During the season, he was chosen to represent the Western Conference in the 2007 OHL All-Star Game and scored a goal. He also helped Plymouth win the OHL title, scoring the championship winning goal in overtime in Game 6 against the Sudbury Wolves. He led all tournament scorers with five goals in the Memorial Cup, held in Vancouver.\nProfessional.\nDallas Stars (2008–2011).\nAfter turning professional for the 2007–08 season, Neal played with Dallas' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Iowa Stars. In 62 games, he scored 18 goals and 19 assists for 37 points. The next season, 2008–09, he scored his first career NHL goal in his first NHL game on October 10, 2008, against Pascal Leclaire of the Columbus Blue Jackets. His first multi-point NHL game came on November 26, 2008, with a two-goal effort against the Minnesota Wild. Famously, Neal's first NHL fight proved to be a memorable and quick victory. On December 18, 2008, he was challenged to a fight by Columbus forward Derick Brassard after Neal checked Blue Jacket Fedor Tyutin hard into the corner of the Columbus defensive zone in the first period. Neal obliged, and produced a gash near Brassard's left eye with a powerful right punch. Brassard quickly called the fight off, where it was later disclosed that he had dislocated his right shoulder which ended his season. Five days later, Neal scored his first NHL hat-trick during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on December 23, 2008, in an 8–2 win. His early season performance led to a nomination to the YoungStars roster for the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. He also broke the Stars' team record for goals scored by a rookie (not including the franchise's years as the Minnesota North Stars), surpassing Jussi Jokinen's record of 17 goals set in 2005–06, in a 10–2 rout of the New York Rangers on February 6, 2009. He completed the campaign with 24 goals and 37 points.\nIn the Stars' 2009–10 season opener, on October 3, 2009, Neal recorded Dallas' first and second goals of the season against the Nashville Predators. He improved to 55 points in his second NHL season. On September 16, 2010, just prior to the commencement of the 2010–11 season, Neal signed a two-year contract extension with the Stars worth $2.25 million in the first year and $3.5 million in the second.\nPittsburgh Penguins (2011–2014).\nLeading up to the 2011 trade deadline, on February 21, Neal was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins (along with defenceman Matt Niskanen) in exchange for defenceman Alex Goligoski. Neal scored his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal on April 20 against the Tampa Bay Lightning in double overtime to give Pittsburgh a 3–1 series lead.\nOn February 19, 2012, one day after scoring 30 goals for the first time in his career, Neal signed a six-year contract extension with an average annual value of $5 million. He scored his second career hat-trick, and first as a Pittsburgh Penguin, in an 8–4 win against the Winnipeg Jets on March 20, 2012. Neal had a break-out season in 2011–12, finishing with 40 goals and 81 points. On May 24, 2013, he scored his first career playoff hat-trick, against the Ottawa Senators.\nNashville Predators (2014–2017).\nOn June 27, 2014, during the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, Neal was traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Patric Hörnqvist and Nick Spaling. He scored his first goal with the Predators on October 17, 2014, in a 2–0 victory over the Winnipeg Jets.\nNeal had an impressive year in 2015–16, scoring 31 goals and 58 points and setting a new Predators franchise single-season record for plus-minus with +27. In the 2016–17 season, Neal helped lead the Predators to the organization's first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. The Predators faced Neal's old team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, but lost the series four games to two, with the player he was traded for, Patric Hörnqvist, scoring the game-winning goal in the deciding Game 6.\nVegas Golden Knights (2017–2018).\nOn June 21, 2017, Neal was selected by the Vegas Golden Knights in the expansion draft as the Predators' unprotected player. After attending the Golden Knights' first training camp, Neal secured a top-line role to open the 2017–18 season.\nOn October 6, 2017, he scored the franchise's first two goals in a 2–1 comeback victory over the Dallas Stars, helping the Golden Knights achieve victory in their debut. In 71 games for the Golden Knights' successful inaugural season, Neal had 25 goals and 19 assists, placing fourth on the club in goals.\nIn the playoffs, Neal helped the Golden Knights claim the Western Conference title and secure his second successive appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. He contributed with 6 goals and 11 points in 20 games before losing to the Washington Capitals in five games.\nCalgary Flames (2018–2019).\nAfter leaving Vegas as a free agent, on July 2, 2018, Neal signed a five-year, $28.75 million contract with the Calgary Flames. Neal severely underwhelmed in his season with Calgary, only scoring a total of 19 points, less than his lowest single-season goal total on any of his previous teams. He was benched on multiple occasions during the campaign, including being healthy scratched prior to a pivotal game 5 Stanley Cup Playoffs first round matchup against the Colorado Avalanche.\nEdmonton Oilers (2019–2021).\nOn July 19, 2019, the Flames traded Neal to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Milan Lucic and a 2020 conditional third-round pick. Both Neal and Lucic had struggled to live up to the expectations attached to their large salaries on their previous teams and the trade gave both players a chance for a fresh start. On October 8, 2019, Neal scored four goals in a game against the New York Islanders, setting a franchise record for the most goals in the first three games of a season, with six goals. Neal scored 11 goals in the month of October 2019 alone.\nHowever, Neal's production began to tail off as the season progressed, as he battled injury and his ice-time decreased. Neal missed 16 games with an ankle injury he suffered against the Flames on January 29, 2020, and he failed to score a single goal in the 13 games he did play in 2020.\nAt the time of the Lucic-for-Neal trade, the Flames and Oilers had agreed that, should Neal score at least 21 goals in the 2019-20 NHL season and Lucic score at least 10 fewer goals than Neal, the Oilers would owe the Flames a third-round draft choice in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. Due to the abrupt and incomplete finish to the 2019-20 season, the Flames and Oilers remained at an impasse over how to resolve the trade condition, given that Neal finished with 19 goals (two fewer than the required threshold) but was on pace to surpass 21 if the season played to its 82-game conclusion. On July 31, 2020, the NHL ruled that the Oilers owed the Flames a third-round draft choice in Edmonton's choice of either the 2020 or 2021 NHL Entry Drafts as a result of a trade condition the two teams had made as part of the Lucic/Neal swap.\nOn July 27, 2021, the Oilers placed Neal on waivers for the purpose of buying out the remaining two years of his contract.\nSt. Louis Blues (2021–2022).\nAs a free agent over the summer and approaching the season, Neal was invited to attend the St. Louis Blues training camp on a professional tryout contract on September 18, 2021. On October 9, Neal agreed to a one-year contract with the Blues. On January 2, 2022, Neal was placed on waivers by St. Louis.\nAs a free agent over the summer and approaching the season, Neal was invited to attend the Columbus Blue Jackets training camp on a professional tryout contract on September 1, 2022. He was released from his PTO a month later, on October 3.\nInternational play.\nIn the 2006 off-season, Neal was invited to the Canadian national junior team's summer evaluation camp. His physical presence and hard-hitting impressed Canada's coaches, and he was brought back to the team's selection camp in December 2006. His play earned him a spot on the club for the 2007 World Junior Championships in Sweden, where he helped Canada to a gold medal. Two years later, Neal moved on to Canada's men's team for the 2009 IIHF World Championship in Switzerland. He scored three points in as many contests, helping Canada to a silver medal finish in the tournament. In 2011, he again represented Canada at the 2011 IIHF World Championship in Slovakia.\nPersonal life.\nNeal has three younger brothers—Michael, Peter and Nicholas—who also play hockey. Michael was drafted by the Dallas Stars in the fifth round, 149th overall, of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft; Peter last played with the Knoxville Ice Bears in the Southern Professional Hockey League in 2014–15 season; and Nicholas last played for the Cobourg Cougars of the Ontario Junior Hockey League in 2013–14.\nNeal also has a younger sister named Rebecca. In March 2012, he was featured on an episode of \"NHL 36\", which followed him for 36 hours."

        "title": "History of rugby league in South Africa",
        "text": "The History of rugby league in South Africa goes back as far as the 1950s. The 1990s brought about the establishment of the South African Rugby Football League to promote amateur rugby league.\nFailed promotion - 1950s.\nIn 1953, a committee was formed, headed by Mr. Ludwig Japhet, for the sole purpose of promotion of rugby league. No doubt, the decision to form such a committee was the lure of potential sponsorship and gate takings that playing rugby league in new areas or against other nations would undoubtedly bring to the game. Mr. Ludwig Japhet held a meeting with Mr. Bill Fallowfield in December of that year to discuss the possibilities of rugby league promotion in which South Africa was discussed.\nThe labours of the promotional committee bore its fruit in South Africa in 1957 with the British and French teams staging a series of exhibition matches for the promotion of the game. Unfortunately neither the British nor the French took the games seriously, which resulted in light and effortless tackling; the lack of the biff and barge, which the South Africans where so accustom to, left them unsatisfied with what they had seen. After playing the two matches in Benoni and Durban a third was scheduled for East London, although this never did take place.\nAnother attempt - 1960s.\nThe idea of rugby league in South Africa faded with the death of Mr. Ludwig Japhet after the experimental tour, only to be brought back to life with the formation of two almost indistinguishable but totally separate rugby league organisations: The National Rugby League (NRL), formed by one Mr. Norman Lacey and Rugby League South Africa (RLSA) instigated by a Mr Maurice Smith with the formation of a caretaker committee of which Messrs John B. Weill and Irwin Benson where involved and subsequently handed the responsibility of the fledgling organisation.\nBoth leagues saw themselves as the governing body of rugby league in South Africa and thus both had plans to commence competitions in the summer of 1962. Eventually both organisations came to be actively reporting to the British RFL, as well as receiving promotional material which fostered an intense rivalry between the two factions. Unfortunately for rugby league in South Africa, the two organisations could not settle their differences and each went a head with their respectful competitions; so was born rugby league in South Africa, under confusing and hostile circumstances.\nIn that year, both organisations sought touring teams from the UK. The National rugby league organised to have Wakefield Trinity compete against a combined XIII, however as the score lines told, this was perhaps too stiff for the South Africans to handle, losing 59–3. Rugby League South Africa attempted to counteract any of the difficulties its identical twin had in the face of stiff English competition and hired former Wigan, Easts and Australian coach, Dave Brown, for three months. The Lions defeated the South Africans rugby league representative side convincingly. Fortunately, not all was lost as the British later admitting that the South Africans where skilled, only lacking in tactics, specifically defensive, which had lost them the game.\n1962.\nEach organisation went on to make separate applications for affiliation with the International Board. The RLIF must have known that the decision to grant one league affiliation with the board would inevitably lead to the collapse of the other and thus such a move would result in loss of clubs and fans.\nIn an effort to protect the game in South Africa, the international board put forth a proposal to both parties that would effectively see the two league's merged. In reality, the RLIF gave the NRL its death notice, who had little choice but to turn over its clubs to the South African Rugby League as it seemed the RLIF now favoured the SARL over itself. To make the deal more appealing to the NRL, the international board also proposed that the NRL clubs founders be reimbursed for any initial investments through future NRL club profits in the SARL.\n1963.\nSouth African rugby league as it seemed, had a future. Part of this future, it was hoped, was that the nine teams located in the Johannesburg area would launch the 1963 season.\nAt the time when the International Board had made its proposal for the combined governing body for rugby league in South Africa it also stated the significance an invitation from Australia to the South Africans to tour. The Australian board of control also took on the International Boards proposal and in an obvious expression of their interest in seeing rugby league exceed in South Africa, offered the invitational side 65 percent of gross gates and a guaranteed $45,000.\nAs was a tradition already set down in South African rugby league history, only more could go wrong, and it did. The visitors where totally out-played by the Australian's, even taking into account the early injuries sustained by the South Africans. It was obvious the skill and their knowledge of tactics (particularly of the forwards) had not improved and so it set a deep decline for South African rugby league.\nNew beginnings – 1990s.\nIn December 1988 when Widnes and Wigan were both at the top of the Rugby League tree in England, a chance meeting took place in the South African Irish pub called Fibber Maghees next to Kyalami Motor Racing circuit. Dave Southern from Widnes and Tony Barker from Wigan were the individuals the conversation went something like this DS to TB - I contacted Harry Edgar from Open Rugby about a World Development Officer who could help establish League in SA, he wrote back to say that no such position existed and even if it did SA would not be welcome due to the current political regime in power - Apartheid - basically I felt that I was being penalised for being in the country and trying to promote my game.\nTB to DS so what did you do? Well I wrote a masterpiece to the RFL Chairman at Chappeltown Rd Mr David Oxley asking him if the time was not right now for the development of League in SA given the IRB sanction of a world 15 to play against the Springboks at Ellis Park - Mr Oxley replied \"...sport and politics are inextricably mixed, and to ignore one without the other is simply to bury ones head in the sand...\" So what are you going to do now Dave? Well not quite sure at the moment. TB-Why don't we do it ourselves? What? Start League in SA? DS-Yeah I'm up for that how should we start? TB-I'm actually going to the UK for a month when I'm back why don't we get together and talk?\n(This sounded like a cooling off period for me DS to forget about the idea as far as I could tell) Tony gave me his tel number and I duly phoned him in Jan 89 as arranged. Tony needed to be prompted as to who I was and what we had agreed but we set a meeting up to discuss. I was playing RU for Old Edwardians (Old Eds) at the time in a suburb of Jhb called Houghton. My connections were good with the coaching staff and as luck would have it one of the coaches Gary Lewis had a brother in law called Ray Mordt the ex Wigan winger from the 80's.\nWe decided to place an advertisement in the Saturday Star looking for people interested in playing, officiating supporting or watching RL to call our two listed respective telephone numbers. The phone at my place of residence was running hot on the Sunday morning we collected in excess of 40 names of interested parties. A reporter called Rodney Hartman from the Star followed up on the advert and wrote a good article in the paper talking about our plans and desires for RL. He assisted us in advertising our meeting of interested persons at what was to become the inaugural meeting at Old Eds.\nThe meeting saw Dave Southern address the audience of some 60-100 people in a Martin Luther King sort of a way with his I have a dream vision for RL. Ray Mordt attended but was reluctant to nail his colours to the mast since he was unsure of what lay ahead of him perhaps (he went on to become coach of Gauteng Lions). The meeting was met with a positive response with Trevor Lake (Born in Rhodesia was set to play for the Junior Springboks, ex Wigan player) being on hand from the press appeal to add a mature and steady hand to the proceedings he didn't talk formally at the launch other than to say that he would be prepared to support us where he could.\"\nAfter a series of training sessions and friendly games played amongst loose combinations of players at Old Eds and Jeppe Old Boys Rugby Club, The big breakthrough came when Trevor Lake introduced the group to Peter Cook the cricket enthusiast who was involved in the introduction of Kerry Packer style Day Night cricket to SA. With Peter on board we soon had an Inaugural Luncheon arranged as a launching platform for the game and a fund-raiser at the same time. Around the same time Ray Mordt introduce the original Committee which included Trevor Lake, Dave Southern, John Callaghan, Peter Cook and Trevor Lake to the Ex N.Transvaal and Pretoria Harlequins player Jacey Strauss. Numerous meeting took place with Strauss and before too long he was brought onto the Board.\nClub formation in the first year or two was left to Dave Southern who, as well as forming the original team Johannesburg Nomads (later to be known as the Warriors), also conducted coaching clinics at schools such as Witkoppen, Paradise Bend and Leukop Prison School all in the Northern suburbs of Johannesburg. John Callaghan used his business contacts to get us into SAMCOR a motor car production company in Pretoria, from this base we would bring in children from the nearby Mamelodi township. Progress was rapid and very encouraging with hundreds of children turning up on Saturday morning coaching clinics.\n1992.\nUntil this point, the SARL board had only organised the odd friendlies and township clinics. That all changed when SARL organised an inner city championship, the first of its kind under the administrations control.\nJacey Strauss began to effectively run the league in 1992 and set about fundraising; at times utilising his offices (at ABI Coca-Cola bottlers in Midrand) efforts to get things done, which earned the board a new sponsor (Magnis Nissan a local Pretoria motor dealer) for the championship to be held in September.\nMeanwhile, SARL had also made contact with a Melbourne-based entrepreneur Glenn Johnson who in turn, saw potential of Russia coming to South Africa for a test. Importantly, he brought to South Africa his cousin, Paul Matete, the ex-Kiwi international who soon become South African Rhino's coach. Paul Matete used the championship as a launch pad for his first ever-national team to play Russia that November.\nImportantly the championship had attracted Mike Bardsley, an enthusiast who had access to videos, editing equipment and contacts at S.A.B.C, the state broadcaster. Bardsley videoed the championship and some township based coaching clinics and put together a good promotional package. S.A.B.C showed it and the response was good.\nThe championship was staged in Pretoria over two days and included teams from Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. Durban beat Pretoria 8–6 in a very hard final. Two notable guests from England were in attendance, Jim Mills and Sam Evans from Widnes, they were on a fact finding mission and very kindly brought over a gift of a set of Widnes shirts to help with the development plans.\nBarry Haslam refereed seven open age games in 24 hours. It was this that led to further development of the league and South African rugby leagues first referee development program.\nDave Southern's good work in the townships had given SARL useful political allies (NSC etc.) to get approval for the tour. Jacey Strauss found both SA and Russian based sponsors to pay for food, accommodation and matches. The Russian Bears arrived in November.\nSouth Africa lost both their games, leaving it to a local Cape Town side to win back some South African pride. The aggregate crowd for the tour was in excess of 6000, which unfortunately was not enough to have the competition at least break even. Despite the debt, the good crowd figures and pleasing displays from both sides meant that the series had given SARL a small launch pad for the code in South Africa.\nMeanwhile, the RFL was struggling to manage troubles that had arisen in Russian rugby league which led to the RFL to appoint the Australian Rugby League and Bob Abbott as minder of the SARL.\n1993.\nTurmoil hit South African rugby league again as two factions formed within the board when members became disgruntled over poor financial management, extravagance and naivete. Strauss and his entrepreneurs felt the organisation could recover and that the investments over the last year where needed to lift the profile of the game. The alternative faction, behind Lake, where concerned with ill-disciplined planning and aimed at more sustainable growth and thus felt resources should be invested in grassroots and particularly the townships.\nIn January 1993, nine board members, led by Barry Haslam called for Lake's resignation 'out of the blue'. It duly came and with him three other board members followed (Dave Southern, Tony Ellison and John Callaghan). Dave Southern's position was made impossible when he was given an ultimatum to concentrate his, up to now township work in white suburban areas in order to secure a stipend of a payment as a salary. When he asked what the alternative was to the offer to work in white schools he was told that the alternative was that he wouldn't get paid - on being pushed for an answer and obvious acceptance of the terms presented, the Board were surprised when Southern said \"I dont think Im going to get paid?\". This was the start of Mini League South Africa. The exchange of letters, threats, abuse and acrimony was unpleasant on both sides.\nThe period from 1993 to 1994 is supposed to have been an era of unprecedented growth and success of the game in South Africa attributed mostly to the South African televising of the ARL despite the claim that the weekly half-hour highlights package was used more as a \"filler\" than as a program designed to attract significant viewers. The televising ran uninterrupted for 18 months and attracted an average viewership of 1.2 million, no doubt an important advertisement for rugby league in South Africa.\nIn August, the league finances stabilised and Coca-Cola became major sponsor of a youth sevens tournament. The tournament ran with over 1,000 children, still a rugby league record for one festival. Meanwhile, Ian Parnaby and Haslam coached over 90 referees/teachers and ran clinics in the Cape townships for 500 children.\nSouth Africa performed well enough at the World Sevens earlier in the year that the ARL saw fit to give their blessing for a tour to South Africa by Australian outfit North Sydney Bears; negotiated by Struass and Haslam. \nFollowing the Russian tests, the 1993/94 season included an all-time high of 26 clubs from Johannesburg, Cape Town, Natal and Mooi-Nooi. The league also consisted of four regional committees which began to prepare for the arrival of Barla. The number of clubs and regional committees represented a strength to the board, never before seen in South African rugby league.\n1994.\nThe SARL was riding a wave of success and profit from the 1993 season. The BARLA tour was well run, well attended and had good sponsorship. The Rhinos sharpened their own preparation with another good Sydney Sevens. The league was in the black, expanding and taking the game to new areas, such as Randfontein with the Transvaal and BARLA game, which it is reported attracted a crowd of 300.\nThe multi-racial elections of April 1994 precipitated changes to the country that caused League to rapidly lose ground over the next 18 months and since never regain its previous public support.\nGlobal sport exploded; South Africa had legitimate international competition. Rugby Union, soccer, cricket, tennis, golf and athletics made large in-roads into South African psyche as sports people signed up deal after deal and world sport filled South African television screens; leaving little room for rugby league. Former sponsors of township development now diverted all their spare cash to government projects. The league was eventually forced off television as other sports with overseas sponsorship came in, such as swimming, basketball and baseball.\n1995.\nOcki Oosthuizen was a self-made and well known entrepreneur who had been hovering on the fringes of the league well before his arrival in mid-1994 when he was to professionally event manage the October series against Queensland, another tour attributable to Bob Abbott. The Rihnos where coached by Paul Matete and assisted by no less than Artie Beetson. The event ran in the red and the Rhinos where beaten 28–0. Suffering a substantial financial loss, Ockie promptly withdrew his financial support for the December tour by Perth's Western Reds, which went ahead anyway, although it was modestly run, staged and attended.\nThe South African Rugby League club season shrank on the back of SARLs looming financial crisis and a lack of league being broadcast on South African television screens. However, Ockie had not been discouraged by the years misfortunes and arranged to have the ailing SARL office moved to his insurance firm where a consultants developed a business plan for the launching of a professional league in South Africa. However, Ockie lost patience with the board, who were largely amateur club men, as opposed to Ockie who had come from an entrepreneurial life.\nOckie's attitude hardened the moment Super League exploded onto the scene. He was above board about his views, which largely excluded grassroots development, and frantically pursued Super League in with his plans in Leeds and Sydney. But the clubs fought back, undermining Oosthuizen's ambitions and fuelling suspicions and global politics that held back the previous international board.\nBy July 1995, three months before the Centenary World Cup, Ockie Oosthuizen had serious reservations about the likelihood of a deal with Super League.\nTony Fisher arrived to prepare the Rhinos for the World Cup and he and Ootsthuizen - both abrasive- quickly fell out. The Rhinos, a collection of largely club players, trained daily for 15 weeks and confidently beat BARLA in two tests. Oosthuizen was footing the bill and a last-ditch visit by Roy Waudby did not engender Ockie or the British Rugby League to either.\nThe Halifax World Cup saw the Rhinos easily beaten in their three games.\nThe court case against the Australian Super League and Ockie's fallout with the British Rugby League (Maurice Lindsay) ended his involvement with SARL.\n1996.\nSARL steadily became more unstable as Ockie disassociated himself with the board and their membership of the RLIF was suspended. As the Super League and ARL civil war continued in Australia, consuming large sums of money that otherwise would have been used for international development, South Africa was left abandoned like many start up leagues of the time.\nThe South African Rugby League came close to total collapse; the board however regrouped and contact resumed with the RFL. Following the regrouping, the board held a fully democratic annual general meeting. Contact resumed with the RFL, through Maurice Lindsay who supported SARLs ambitions to enter the 1996 student world cup, which SARL had planned to use as a vehicle for reestablishing the ailing SARL and its clubs to its former more stable self. SARL went on to win the bowl-final as opposed to the cup final of the student world cup; a semi-good result.\nThrough some intense lobbying by SARL and constant support from the RFL's Maurice Lindsay, South Africa was further awarded the Student World Cup for 1998.\nFurther to SARL's rebuilding effort, Barry Haslam accepted an invitation to the international board meeting in Auckland of that year. Haslam gave his presentation and proposal for SARL to be invited back as a member of the RLIF. Maurice Lindsay subsequently announced that by a unanimous vote, SARL had been welcomed back to the RLIF.\n1997.\nSARL put together a nines side, coached by ex Springbok Tiaan Strauss and supplemented by South African players that had been strengthened through scholarships to Australian Super League clubs. The SARL nines beat France, Japan, the Cook Islands, drew to Tonga and lost to GB and Fiji. The Australian Press labelled the SARL nines side as 'the surprise package' of the tournament and dramatically improved.\nBill Baguley, Chairman of Germiston and board member, pioneered the \"Athlone\" model. SARL's efforts in the black townships over the years have largely failed due to little infrastructure and support. Schools, however have been encouraging since parents and teachers are great resources and your still establishing the game at a grass roots level. Athlone had developed into an established league playing school, of whom most of its students were black. Athlone went on to regularly play and beat white teams without; one of the few sustained achievements of the 1990s SARL board.\nThe team that left South African shores to tour Australia were studded with ex-Springbok, union players. Some of the Union stars of the 60's, played Rugby League but did not adapt fast enough to challenge any rugby team on their tour to Australia. There they suffered two defeats but very little was said about this team which learned by their mistakes. to score a narrow win of 7–4 in the land of the White Cloud! The team was known as the \"Springbok Rugby League side\", the first and very last to wear a Springbok on their blazers. Back biome, the South Africans faced the unforeseen! Virtually all the municipalities were instructed not to make plying fields available to Rugby League in South Africa. Players were scorned as \"Traitors\" and were out cast for selling their first birth right, namely union or amateur rugby. The game that was loved by dedicated rugby stars was a dying one. But the fighting spirit of\na young rugby player (Jan Prinsloo, also called \"Jan Das\", from Pretoria Rugby League Club, took up the gloves with the South African Rugby Board and in particular with the President of the Union, Dr. Danie Craven. Dr. Danie who had sympathy with League said that although he had tried to have the league players reinstated, there was nothing he could do as it was in the hands of the International Rugby Board. Those letters and correspondence is available and in the position of Prinsloo who said that rugby league will one day become a giant amongst rugby codes in the world and until then he will not rest to see this happened. The battle went on for some time and many others tried to revive the sport. The sand was running out and many of the players became disillusioned. The years went by. In the background stood the very same young man. Prinsloo, who has now become an old man, always wearing his Springbok Rugby League blazer. After 60 years of dedicated service to League, he was heralded as a Legend in South Africa's League Hall of fame and was bestowed for a second time the honor as a Legend when he received Rugby League's Highest accolade the Rhino Blaser, the only Rugby League player to be awarded double Legend status. What happened is history and a chapter that needs not to be forgotten or ignored or scraped. The history of the game forms the backbone of Rugby League in South Africa."

        "text": "John Michael \"Jumpin' Johnny\" Green (December 8, 1933 – November 16, 2023) was an American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans, earning consensus second-team All-American honors. He was a four-time NBA All-Star.\nEarly life.\nJohn Michael Green was born in Dayton, Ohio, on December 8, 1933. He attended Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. Green was under six feet tall in high school and didn't play basketball. He worked part-time at a Dayton bowling alley and, after graduation, for a construction company and at a junkyard for six months before joining the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War. It was while in the military that, at age 20, he sprouted to 6-foot-5 and played on the base's basketball team.\nThe Marine base football coach, Dick Evans, a Michigan State University (then College) alumnus, recognized Green's athletic ability and wrote a letter of recommendation to MSU basketball coach Forddy Anderson. Green, by then age 21, visited MSU while on leave in October 1955.\nCollege career.\nAfter completing his military commitment, Green enrolled at Michigan State in 1955, and played on the 1955–56 Spartans' freshman team. He became eligible to play on the varsity in January 1957, at age 23.\nGreen played in 18 games that season as a power forward, setting a new Michigan State rebounding record with 14.6 per game as the Spartans were Big Ten champions. They advanced to the NCAA tournament semifinal game, which they lost in triple overtime to eventual champion North Carolina despite Green's 19 rebounds and eight blocked shots. The Spartans finished the season winning 12 out of 13 games to end with a 16–10 overall record.\nAs a junior in 1957–58, he increased his per-game rebounding average to 17.8 while averaging 18.0 points per game on 53.8 percent field goal shooting. He was named second-team All-American by NABC and \"The Sporting News\" and third-team All-American by the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI) and the Helms Foundation.\nIn 1958–59, he led the Spartans to another Big Ten title and a 19–4 record, falling a game short of the NCAA Final Four. Averaging 18.5 points and 16.6 rebounds per game, he earned first-team All-American honors from the Helms Foundation and was second-team All-American of AP, UPI, NABC and \"The Sporting News\".\nWhile in college, he was married and in 1957 Green's wife gave birth to sons Jeffery and Johnny.\nGreen's career rebounding average was 16.4 per game, topped in Big Ten history by only hall-of-famer Jerry Lucas' 17.2. He remains third on the Spartans' all-time career rebounding list with 1,036 – in less than three seasons. He also averaged 16.9 points per game, scoring 1,062 overall.\nGreen was also named first-team All-Big Ten for three years and was named Big Ten MVP in 1958–59.\nMichigan State named an annual rebounding award in Green's honor. His jersey number 24 was retired by Michigan State. He was inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 1992.\nProfessional career.\nGreen was a first-round draft pick (fifth overall) in the 1959 NBA draft by the New York Knicks.\nIn his rookie season of 1959–60 for the Knicks, during which he turned age 26, he played nearly 18 minutes per game, averaging 7.0 points and 7.8 rebounds. On February 26, 1960, against the Philadelphia Warriors, he set a Knicks rookie record that still stands with 25 rebounds.\nHis playing time increased in 1960–61, when he averaged 10.2 points and 10.7 rebounds. He was a full-time starter in 1961–62, averaging 15.9 points and 13.3 rebounds, leading the team in rebounds with 1,066, and he was named to the NBA All-Star Game. In February 1962, he set Knicks team record with three consecutive games of 20 or more rebounds (since tied by Walt Bellamy, Willis Reed and Tyson Chandler).\nIn 1962–63 his scoring average was a career-high 18.1 along with 12.1 rebounds per game, and he again led the Knicks with 964 rebounds. He was named an NBA All-Star for the second time.\nGreen's playing time dipped slightly in 1963–64, but he still averaged 14.5 points and 10.0 rebounds per game including a season-high 27 points on November 16, 1963, against the Cincinnati Royals. He also led the Knicks in rebounding for a third consecutive season with 799.\nIn 1964–65, he averaged 11.0 points and 7.0 rebounds and was named an NBA all-star for the third time. He had a season-high 33 points on December 30, 1964, against the San Francisco Warriors.\nIn 1965–66, his seventh with the Knicks, after seven games he was traded to the Baltimore Bullets. For the season, he averaged 11.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game and his .536 field goal percentage ranked second in the league. In 1966–67 with the Bullets, in a part-time role he averaged 8.2 points and 6.5 rebounds.\nOn May 1, 1967, he was drafted by the San Diego Rockets in the NBA expansion draft. During the 1967–68 season, he played in 42 games for the Rockets, averaging over 25 minutes per game. On January 11, 1968, he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, for whom he played 35 games in a reduced role, averaging just over 10 minutes per game. For the season, he averaged 13.9 points and 10.1 rebounds per game.\nIn 1968–69, during which he turned 35 years old, he again averaged just over 10 minutes per game with the 76ers, averaging a career-low 4.7 points and 4.5 points per game. After the season, he was released by the 76ers.\nHowever, just when it appeared Green's NBA career might be over after 10 seasons, in September 1969 he called Cincinnati Royals coach Bob Cousy and asked for a tryout. He signed as a free agent with the Royals and had a career resurgence in the 1969–70 season. He became a starter for the Royals, averaging 15.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at .559. He had a season-high 32 points on March 11, 1970, against the Boston Celtics and averaged 23.5 points per game over the final seven games.\nThe resurgence continued in 1970–71 – at age 37, he again led the NBA in field goal percentage at .587, averaging 16.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game – and he was named an NBA all-star for the fourth time in his career. On December 20, 1970, he had one of his best-ever games, scoring a career-high 39 points in a one-point double-overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.\nThere wasn't much fall-off in 1971–72. Although he turned 38, he played in all 82 games, averaging 9.8 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.\nThe following season, 1972–73, the Royals franchise relocated and became the Kansas City-Omaha Kings. But despite turning 39, he remained a significant contributor, playing nearly 19 minutes per game and averaging 7.1 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. It was his final NBA season.\nGreen tallied 12,281 points and 9,083 rebounds in his 14-year career, with per-game averages of 11.6 points and 8.6 rebounds with a career .493 field goal percentage.\nAfter basketball.\nGreen entered the restaurant business and owned one of the most popular McDonald's franchises in the world in Springfield Gardens, New York, near John F. Kennedy International Airport.\nGreen lived in Dix Hills, New York. He died at a hospital in Huntington, New York, on November 16, 2023, at the age of 89.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "title": "East Melbourne Cricket Ground",
        "text": "The East Melbourne Cricket Ground was a grass oval sports venue located at the southwest corner of Jolimont Road and Jolimont Parade (now known as Wellington Parade South) in East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The site is best known for playing host to many sporting events during the city of Melbourne's early existence, consisting mainly of cricket and Australian rules football, although the ground occasionally hosted soccer matches. Its closure was predicated by the annexure of the land by Victoria Railways to enable stabling and marshalling of trains as part of the electrification of Melbourne's metropolitan rail service.\nHistory.\nThe ground was opened in 1860 and closed in 1921. It adjoined the Melbourne Cricket Ground and was not far from the Richmond Cricket Ground, all three grounds being sited in the area formerly known as Captain Lonsdale's Cow Paddock, now Yarra Park.\nCricket.\nEast Melbourne Cricket Club was the most successful member of the Victorian Cricket Association (VCA) during the 19th Century and early 20th Century, winning more than half of the VCA's Premierships during that period. The club was formed in 1857 as the Abbotsford Cricket Club but they soon changed their name as part of a push to use the East Melbourne ground. The team mainly consisted of Scotch College old boys.\nFour first-class cricket games were played at the ground in the 1880s, including the Smokers v Non-Smokers match, in which the Non-Smokers made 803, at the time a world record innings score.\nAustralian rules football.\nThe oval was used for Australian rules football games during the winter months from 1878. The ground also hosted the first-ever interstate representative football match, on 1 July 1879, between Victoria - represented by the Victorian Football Association (VFA) - and South Australia. The match was attended by more than 10,000 people. It also hosted the first intercollegiate football match in Melbourne, played on 21 July 1881 between teams from the University of Melbourne colleges Trinity and Ormond.\nTenant football clubs of the ground included:\nThe ground hosted 426 senior matches in the recognised top level of Victorian football - 201 matches in the VFA and 225 matches in the VFL/AFL - in 44 seasons of competition.\nIt also held 30 VFA finals between 1903 and 1921. The VFL held one final in the 1897 and 1901 finals series and the 1900 Grand Final at the ground, while the VFA also held the 1896 premiership play-off match at the ground.\nAs a venue for football, the East Melbourne Cricket Ground had an unusual quirk that the field sloped downhill towards the railway end, but was often affected by a strong wind which blew to the pavilion end.\nThe record football crowd at the venue was 36,185 for a VFA match between Essendon and South Melbourne in 1891, the record attendance for a match at that time.\nThe VFL record was 20,181 for the 1900 Grand Final, with the record for a VFL home and away match being 18,000, set twice in 1921.\nSoccer.\nOccasionally, soccer was played at the oval. The best known use for the sport were the interstate representative matches between the colonies of Victoria and New South Wales in the 1880s. Four matches were played between 1883 and 1887 with three taking place at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground with the other being played at the South Melbourne Cricket Ground that ended in a nil-all draw.\nLacrosse.\nThe ground was occasionally used as a venue for lacrosse, and hosted Victoria's first intercolonial lacrosse match on 1 September 1888, against South Australia (the first intercolonial match in Australia was played between Queensland and New South Wales a year earlier). The match was not largely attended, due in part to the cold and showery weather on the day, with Victoria winning the match by 5 goals to 1.\nClosure.\nAfter the 1921 football season, the ground was closed and then demolished to make way for an extension of the Jolimont Yard railway sidings.\nThe East Melbourne Cricket Club subsequently amalgamated with the Hawthorn Cricket Club to form the Hawthorn-East Melbourne Cricket Club, and moved to Hawthorn's Glenferrie Oval. One of the wooden stands was moved from East Melbourne to Glenferrie Oval, where it stood until 1965, when it was replaced by the Dr A.S. Ferguson Stand.\nAfter the Essendon Football Club lost the use of the ground, it moved to the Essendon Recreation Reserve. It had initially tried to move to the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve, resulting in a major off-field political struggle between the Essendon Association and Football Clubs, the VFL and the VFA.\nThe former site of the ground has now been taken over by a housing estate, a feature of which is a semi-circular housing block with a tower obviously designed to look like an ersatz football pavilion. The remaining part of the oval in front of that block is now a park."

        "text": "John Drake (\"Jack\") Scott (31 January 1888 – 7 April 1964) was an Australian cricketer and Test match umpire. Scott played as a right-arm fast bowler and was also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman. He was the first man to dismiss Don Bradman in first-class cricket, in December 1927. Scott went on to umpire fifty games, including ten Ashes tests.\nCricket career.\nBorn in Sydney, Scott's first-class playing career ran for two decades, from 1908–09 to the 1928–29 Australian seasons. During this time he played 59 matches. He also played rugby league for Newtown and in 1908 had the distinction of scoring the club's first ever premiership try.\nThe bulk of his cricket career was spent with New South Wales, but he moved to South Australia for the 1925–26 season. Scott's best bowling figures were 6–48 against Victoria, taken in 1909–10. The 1913–14 season saw him make his only century, exactly 100 against Queensland.\nAfter his retirement from playing, Scott stood as a first-class umpire on more than 50 occasions, including ten Test matches between 1936 and 1947. His first match was between Australia and England at the Brisbane Cricket Ground on 4 to 9 December 1936, a match convincingly won by the visitors. Scott's partner in that match was George Borwick.\nScott and Borwick went on to stand in another nine Ashes Tests matches together: a further four as part of the 1936–37 tour and five more on the 1946–47 tour. Scott's last match was at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 28 February to 5 March 1947.\nAs a player, Scott was regarded as a \"likeable larrikin\". In his early career, Johnnie Moyes compared him to Tibby Cotter, while Jack Pollard called him \"a fiery, outspoken fast bowler with a long record of defying authority\". Indeed, Scott was barred for an entire Sydney grade season after a show of bad temper. As an umpire, he earned a reputation for disciplining fast bowlers for bowling short rising deliveries – the type of bowling for which he had been known.\nScott died at Springbank, South Australia at the age of 76."

Anita Wachter of Austria won the women's overall title, her first. Both winners won narrow victories because of their superior performance in the combined (Girardelli won all three for men en route to a 32-point victory over Kjetil André Aamodt; Wachter won one of the two for women (and was fourth in the other) en route to a 20-point victory over Katja Seizinger). In December, defending women's World Cup champion Petra Kronberger of Austria abruptly retired, saying that she had lost her motivation to continue.\nLack of snow in Europe during the winter caused the schedule to be significantly rearranged. All of the races at the classic sites of Wengen and Kitzbühel were cancelled. Snowmaking was installed at Kitzbühel that summer as a result. Also, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into two countries—the Czech Republic and Slovakia—effective as of January 1, 1993, although the ski team remained unified until the end of the season.\nAt the end of the season in March, the International Ski Federation (FIS) added a World Cup Final, which immediately became a permanent part of the World Cup agenda. During this final, weather permitting, men's and women's races are held in each of the four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and downhill, as well as a team parallel slalom competition. Only a limited number of racers are invited to ski at the Finals, including the top 25 in the World Cup standings in each discipline, plus the current junior World Champions in each discipline, plus competitors for the overall title who failed to qualify on points within the discipline (if any). Because of the smaller field, World Cup points are only awarded to the top 15 finishers in each race.\nMen.\nOverall.\nsee complete table\nIn 1993, all the results count toward the overall title.

Zurbriggen won his third overall title; Figini her second.\nBeginning this year, the limitation on the number of events that would count for overall and discipline championships, which had been present since the founding of the World Cup, was eliminated. The intent was to eliminate ties for discipline titles, although the first tiebreaker (number of wins) was retained; additionally, this would permit skiers to accumulate more points toward the overall title from their strongest disciplines.\nA break in the schedule in February was for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The alpine events were held at the new Nakiska ski area. As the Olympics was in the process of eliminating its prior ban on professionals being allowed to compete, Swedish star Ingemar Stenmark returned to the Olympics after having been banned in 1984 (although Stenmark still received his payments from sponsors at his Monaco address, not through the Swedish federation).

The overall champions were Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, his second consecutive overall win, and Maria Walliser of Switzerland, her first.\nThis was the first season in which a separate discipline championship was awarded for Super G, which had been introduced as a part of giant slalom in the 1983 season. The addition increased the number of discipline champions to five, which led to the elimination of the Combined discipline championship the next season. Combined would not award another World Cup discipline championship until after the introduction of the \"Super Combined\" (downhill/slalom) or \"Alpine combined\" (Super G/slalom) races, but that championship would only last from the 2006/07 season until it was again eliminated after the 2011/12 season.\nIn addition, the number of men's races that counted for World Cup championship points reached 45, which remains the all-time high.

        "text": "The 18th World Cup season began in December 1983 in Kranjska Gora, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia), and concluded in March 1984 in Oslo, Norway. The overall champions were Pirmin Zurbriggen (his first) and Erika Hess (her second), both of Switzerland.\nA break in the schedule in February was for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now Bosnia). The debate over amateur and professional status of world-class skiers came to a head this year over the issue of the Olympic eligibility of the holders of FIS Class B licenses, which were approved in 1981 to permit skiers to accept sponsorship money directly instead of through their national ski federations or Olympic committees. After protests by some of the other top skiers (including twin brothers Phil and Steve Mahre), the International Ski Federation (FIS) ruled in the summer of 1983 that the two holders of such licenses, Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein, would be ineligible to compete in the Olympics unless they surrendered those licenses and transferred the money received under them to the appropriate national ski or Olympic committees.\nAlthough Wenzel was willing to transfer her money as requested, Stenmark, who had moved his tax residence to Monaco and had received an amount estimated at over $5 million in payments during those three years, was not, because repatriating the money to Sweden would subject him to millions of dollars in Swedish income tax. Despite the different reactions of the two, FIS decided to treat Stenmark and Wenzel identically and ban them both from Olympic competition in 1984, while permitting both to continue to compete in World Cup competitions. After the Olympics, Hanni Wenzel, who had won two overall World Cup titles and finished second or third overall six more times, retired, and several of the other top skiers, such as the Mahre twins and Norway's Jarle Halsnes, turned professional and left the World Cup circuit. The backlash over this series of events, combined with the increasing television revenues from the Olympic Games, led to the end of the ban on professional athletes in the Olympics before the end of the decade.\nIn another ruling regarding Olympic eligibility, FIS denied rising all-event skier Marc Girardelli, who was a citizen of Austria but who competed for Luxembourg on the World Cup circuit, the ability to compete in the Olympics for Austria, ruling that he could only compete for the country that he represented on the World Cup circuit. As a result, Girardelli was not able to compete in the Olympics until after his Luxembourg citizenship was granted in the mid-1980s.\nMen.\nOverall.\nsee complete table\nIn men's overall World Cup 1983/84 the best five downhills, best five giant slaloms/Super-G, best five slaloms and best three combined count.

        "title": "New Zealand Ice Hockey League",
        "text": "The New Zealand Ice Hockey League (NZIHL) is New Zealand's top-level ice hockey league. Established in 2005 by Guenther Birgel, the NZIHL is sanctioned by New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation (a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation). The NZIHL is an amateur league with players not paid to play. The NZIHL champion is awarded the Birgel Cup. The NZIHL is currently contested by six teams from three affiliated regions, including three teams from the North Island and three teams from the South Island. The most successful team in NZIHL history is the SkyCity Stampede, who have claimed eight NZIHL championships. The current champion, from 2023, is the SkyCity Stampede.\nHistory.\nThe New Zealand Ice Hockey League (NZIHL) was formed in 2005 to develop the sport of ice hockey in New Zealand by Guenther Birgel, and to give the top players in the country regular competitive hockey to improve the skill level of the game domestically and make New Zealand more competitive on the international stage. The league was setup with restrictions on import players (players born outside of New Zealand and Australia) to assist in the promotion of local players to help achieve its founding goals. Scheduling for NZIHL would fit into the Northern Hemisphere's ice hockey offseason, to enable a small amount of quality import players to help grow the sport and teach local players. The league was founded with four teams that included the Canterbury Red Devils, West Auckland Admirals, Southern Stampede and South Auckland Swarm.\nThe first ever game of the NZIHL in the inaugural 2005 season, was played on 3 June 2005 at Paradice Botany Downs, Auckland. The game saw hosts, West Auckland Admirals, defeat the visiting Canterbury Red Devils 5–2, with all goals coming in the third period after blank first and second periods.\nThe maiden season ran for four rounds and twelve games followed by a best of three finals series in Dunedin. Southern Stampede finished top of the regular season standings, claiming the league premiership. The Stampede were joined by the Admirals in the finals series. Southern Stampede were crowned NZIHL champions and lifted the maiden NZIHL Trophy with a 2–0 clean sweep of the finals series. Simon Glass, from the Stampede, finished as the league's first top points scorer with 14 points and took out the league MVP award. Steven Reid, also of the Stampede, was named Finals MVP.\nPrior to 2007 season, the South Auckland Swarm changed its name to the Botany Swarm in order to differentiate themselves with a more unique name from the West Auckland Admirals. Previously there had been confusion around the similar names. Botany was chosen as the Swarm's home rink is located in the Auckland suburb of Botany Downs.\nIn 2008, the league expanded for the first time and added a fifth team. The Dunedin Thunder joined the league as a second team from Otago, creating the first South Island derby in the league along with the Southern Stampede. The Stampede relocated to Queenstown leaving the Thunder to build its supporter base in Dunedin.\nFor the 2010 season, the league announced a change to the NZIHL championship trophy. The NZIHL trophy was retired and the league introduced the Birgel Cup to be handed to the league champion who wins the NZIHL Finals.\nTeams.\nFoundation clubs.\nThe NZIHL had four foundation clubs, Canterbury Red Devils, West Auckland Admirals, Southern Stampede and South Auckland Swarm. These four teams covered three of four affiliated regions that make up the New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation, this being Auckland, Canterbury and Southern.\nExpansion.\nIn 2008, the first expansion of the NZIHL took place. Dunedin Thunder was founded and admitted into the league. With the Thunder entering the league and basing itself in Dunedin, the Southern Stampede, who has been based in Dunedin, moved to Queenstown. In 2021, the NZIHL expanded for a second time by admitted a third Auckland based team into the league. Auckland Mako joined the league after being established in the same year as a youth development team following IIHF competition cancellations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mako split home games between Paradice Avondale and Paradice Botany.\nFuture expansion.\nFuture expansion of the NZIHL is limited due to small number of ice rink facilities across the country. There is ongoing discussions regarding construction of new ice facilities in different parts of New Zealand. If any new facility is built, expansion of the NZIHL is likely. Despite having a regional association with the Federation, Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, does not have any ice sports facilities. This has meant the third largest city in the country is not represented in the NZIHL. In 2011, it was reported that the local Wellington City Council was considering options for building a permanent ice rink facility, while they agreed to a privately paid for temporary rink to be constructed on Wellington's waterfront at Queens Wharf to attract Rugby World Cup fans and holidaying school children for the Wintergarden event. In 2015, the Wellington Regional Multi-Purpose Sports and Recreational Ice Arena Trust was incorporated with a view of planning, constructing and operating a 2,500 seat ice sports facility in the Wellington region. The project was estimated to cost $11 million, with the Trust looking to sign an agreement with the Wellington City Council for the land and then raise funding for the project through donations, fundraising and loans. However, as of 2023, no proposed ice rink project has been completed in Wellington despite the popularity of the temporary ice rinks in the city over the years.\nNew Zealand-Australia interaction.\nWith the NZIHL quality improving over the years, there has been talk of creating a combined Oceania competition that would see the New Zealand league merge with the Australian league, Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). In 2011 the AIHL Chairman Tyler Lovering confirmed talks had taken place with NZIHL General Manager Gunther Birgel regarding the prospect of New Zealand based teams joining the AIHL within the next three years.\nWhile no combined league has been subsequently established yet, in 2011 the Australian and New Zealand leagues did agree to set-up the Trans-Tasman Champions League. The Champions League would see the top two teams from each league qualify and compete in a tournament to be crowned Trans-Tasman champions. The first and only edition of the Champions League was played in Melbourne in 2012 with Botany Swarm, Southern Stampede, Newcastle North Stars and Melbourne Ice competing. The NZIHL teams failed to win a game in the tournament, and while the second edition was scheduled to be played in Queenstown in 2013, the tournament was cancelled and never contested again. \nInstead, the federations for Australia and New Zealand ice hockey favoured setting up more regular international series between the two countries, with the New Zealand Winter Games identified as a platform for the two national teams to come together and face-off regularly. The two nations have played together in series at the 2009, 2011, 2017, 2018 and 2019 New Zealand Winter Games.\nIn 2022, a new Australian based league was announced named the Pacific Hockey League (PHL). This new league identified expansion into New Zealand from its outset to create an Oceanian league connecting Australia and New Zealand. Rather than try and come to an agreement with the NZIHL and its member clubs, the PHL decided to establish a new team in Queenstown named the Queenstown Rush in 2022. It was intended that this new team would join the league in 2023, allowing sufficient lead time for the Rush to establish itself properly and get ready for competition. However, the Rush never got the opportunity to take part in the PHL, when in early 2023, the league announced it was ceasing operations.\nAlso in 2022, the Australian and New Zealand federations jointly announced a new concept of an All-Star match between the winners of the AIHL and NZIHL. It was the first time since the Champions League in 2012 that there was the prospect of the two leagues interacting with each other. The game would be scheduled after the completion of both league seasons in 2022. However, the all-star game concept was shelved and instead a new international series between Australia and New Zealand was announced in its place. The first series was played in Melbourne in October 2022 and the second series was played in Queenstown in March 2023.\nSeason structure and rules.\nRegular season.\nThe NZIHL regular season is typically played between May and September each year. The regular season consists of 40 games in total, with each of the main five teams playing 16 games in a home and away round-robin season structure. Each team plays each other team four times, two at home and two away. The sixth team, Auckland Mako, are a U23 development team who play less games than the other five teams due to the varied nature of the team’s roster. Mako plays between four and ten games a season and are ineligible for the NZIHL finals. Because of this, Mako’s games do not count towards the NZIHL standings and player statistics are recorder separately from the rest of the league. The NZIHL regular season points system, follows similar systems widely used in Europe and Australian ice hockey leagues. 3 points is awarded for a regulation time win, 2 points for a shootout win, 1 point for a shootout loss and 0 points for a regulation time loss. In the unlikely event of a draw, both teams will be awarded 1 point each.\nGame rules and governance.\nAll games and NZIHL events are to be played in accordance to the rules set out in the NZIHL events manual, followed by the International Ice Hockey Federation Rule Book. The NZIHL has adopted the international standard three 20-minute stop-time regulation period length for all regular season and finals games. All regular season and finals overtime periods are five minutes long with golden goal rules (first to score wins). Where possible with ice rink facilities, and upon prior decision by the NZIHL General Manager, the three grand final games will implement a 3 on 3 single 20 minute overtime period followed by a shootout. Governance for the events manual falls to the NZIHL executive, headed by the General Manager (GM), and oversighted by the New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation (NZIHF) Management Committee. The NZIHL executive meet regularly with the NZIHF Management Committee, participate in NZIHF AGMs, prepare yearly budgets and write annual reports. All three NZIHF affiliated regions with NZIHL teams are evenly represented.\nRoster &amp; import rules.\nThere are no maximum roster limits in the NZIHL. Players must be 16 years or older and registered with their regional association to play in the NZIHL. Female players are eligible to play as goaltenders. Mid-season player transfers between NZIHL teams are prohibited unless given special dispensation by the NZIHL General Manager. NZIHL players are broken up into two categories, regional players (New Zealand or Australian citizens) and import players (a citizen of any other country). This categorisation was updated in 2022 and replaced the old three category system of NZ player, naturalised player and import player, used prior to 2022. Import players and Australian citizens must have a cleared international transfer card (ITC) in order to be eligible to play an NZIHL game. There are no limits on the number of import players allowed on a team's roster, however there is a limit on the number of import players teams are allowed to dress for a game. As of 2022, four import players from each team (eight in total) are allowed to dress for any one game, with import goaltenders counting as two import players. The NZIHL covers the traveling costs of traveling teams up to 15 skaters, two goaltenders and five staff (22 in total). Any additional traveling players or staff need to be financial covered by the teams themselves.\nPlayer status.\nPlayers in the NZIHL are amateur and are not paid to play. NZIHL teams are however allowed to assist with associated costs for players to play in the NZIHL, including: airfares, accommodation, transportation, food, international transfer card fees, registration fees, ice time fees, playing fees and equipment support. In addition, players may be paid reasonable rates for coaching ice hockey, with the rate no more than would be reasonable within the market for the services provided. \nPlayoffs.\nPlayoffs in the NZIHL are called the Finals. The finals are played over two weekends with a best of 2 game semi-final series followed by a best of 3 game grand finals series. The top three teams from the regular season qualify for the finals. The top placed team qualifies automatically for the grand final series. The second and third placed teams qualify for the semi-final series. The winner of the semi-final series advances to the grand final series. The top placed team hosts the grand final series at their home venue. The second placed team hosts the semi-finals series at their home venue.\nPrevious season structures.\nPreviously, the NZIHL has had a number of different season structures since foundation in 2005. \nLeague trophies.\nBirgel Cup.\nThe Birgel cup is the principle trophy in New Zealand ice hockey named after Gunther Birgel, founder of NZ ice hockey league . It is the NZIHL championship trophy and was first awarded in 2010, when it replaced the original NZIHL Trophy. The Birgel Cup is given to the winner of the NZIHL Finals series at the conclusion of the NZIHL season.\nToa Kauhanga Riri Tio.\nThe Toa Kauhanga Riri Tio challenge trophy (TKRT) was introduced in the 2012 season. The Māori trophy name translates to \"champions of the ice battlefield\" and was designed and built by Wellington craftsman Mark Newnham. The premise of the trophy is loosely based on the Ranfurly Shield challenge system. The TKRT is contested during each NZIHL regular season. The current holders of the Riri Tio must defend the trophy on home ice in the second game of each round. The Auckland Mako are not entitled to challenge for the trophy and the TKRT was not challenged in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFormer trophies.\nNZIHL Trophy.\nThe NZIHL Trophy was the original championship trophy for the NZIHL. It was awarded five times between 2005 and 2009 before being replaced by the Birgel Cup. The Southern Stampede and Botany Swarm lifted the NZIHL trophy an equal record times, winning the trophy twice each. Canterbury Red Devils was the only other team to lift the trophy, winning the final trophy in 2009.\nGlass Family Shield.\nThe Glass Family Shield was awarded annually to the winner of the Skate Of Origin series between its inception in 2009 and conclusion in 2016. The shield was named after the South Island Glass family who were leaders and builder of the sport of ice hockey within New Zealand over the course of three generations. Ben Glass is a founding member of the NZIHF and patron of the Southern Ice Hockey League (SIHL). Graeme Glass is the past president of the NZIHF and inducted life member. While Simon Glass, Ben Lewis &amp; Hamish Lewis have all previously represented New Zealand at international level with the Ice Blacks, with Simon also captaining the national team. In addition, Annabelle Lewis also represented the New Zealand women's national team, the Ice Fernz.\nSkate Of Origin was introduced in 2009 and ran from 2009 to 2016. The series was used as an All-star game and often a national team selection process. The format saw the best players eligible to represent New Zealand at an international level play for the respective island on which they played their junior hockey. Players represented one of the two major islands of the New Zealand archipelago, namely the North Island or the South Island. The host of the Origin alternated each season with the North Island hosting the inaugural Skate of Origin at Paradice Botany Downs. Throughout the history of the Origin, the North Island won the series and lifted the Glass Family Shield five times compared to the South Island's three times.\nTrans-Tasman Trophy.\nThe Trans-Tasman Trophy was the championship trophy for the winner of the Trans-Tasman Champions League (TTCL). Established in 2012 as a joint venture between the New Zealand Ice Hockey League and the Australian Ice Hockey League, the TTCL was created to expand relations, cooperation and competition between the top ice hockey leagues of Australia and New Zealand. The TTCL was designed to be an annual event played over a single weekend with the host alternating between New Zealand and Australia. The champions and premiers of both the NZIHL and AIHL would qualify for the Champions League and would play each team from the other league twice over the weekend. The first, and so far only edition, of the Trans-Tasman Champions League, saw the NZIHL send the Botany Swarm and Southern Stampede to travel to Melbourne to contest the Champions League for the right to lift the Trans-Tasman Trophy. AIHL team, Melbourne Ice won the 2012 TTCL, with the NZIHL teams failing to win a game. \nIn 2013, the second edition of the tournament was intended to be played in New Zealand but costs prevented the AIHL sending any teams and the Champions League was cancelled. In 2016, there was discussions to revive the TTCL with the champions of the NZIHL and AIHL playing in a 3 game series in New Zealand, but the NZIHF and IHA decided an international series between the [Ice Blacks]] and Mighty Roos would be better, with a view to return to the Trans-Tasman Champions League and Trans-Tasman Trophy sometime in the future.

        "title": "Tropical nations at the Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Several tropical nations have participated in the Winter Olympics despite not having the climate for winter sports. Partly because of that, their entries are a subject of human interest stories during the Games. No tropical nation has ever won a Winter Olympic medal. \nThe first warm-weather, but not tropical, nation participating in the Winter Olympics was Mexico. Much of Mexico is at a latitude north of the Tropic of Cancer, and most of the country has a subtropical highland or semi-arid climate, so it is not exclusively a tropical nation. Nonetheless, Mexico made its Winter Olympic debut at the 1928 Winter Olympics with a five-man bobsleigh team that finished eleventh of twenty-three entrants. Mexico did not return again to the Winter Games until the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nThe first truly tropical nation to compete in the Winter Olympic Games is the Philippines, who sent two alpine skiers to the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Ben Nanasca placed 42nd in giant slalom skiing (out of 73 entrants), and Juan Cipriano did not finish. In slalom skiing, neither skier was able to finish. Costa Rica became the second tropical nation to participate at the Winter Games, in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, where Arturo Kinch also competed in alpine skiing events. Kinch would continue to compete for Costa Rica at three more Winter Games, including the 2006 Winter Olympics at age 49. There he finished 96th in the 15 km cross-country skiing event, ahead of only Prawat Nagvajara of Thailand, another tropical nation.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada attracted many tropical nations, including Costa Rica, Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Netherlands Antilles, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Jamaica bobsleigh team became a fan favorite at these Games and were later the inspiration of the 1993 motion picture \"Cool Runnings\". In the 1994 Winter Olympics six years later, the Jamaican four-man sled placed a creditable fourteenth, ahead of the United States and Russia, while Jamaican-born bobsledder Lascelles Brown won silver for Canada in 2006.\nThe 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy marked the Winter Games debut of Ethiopia and Madagascar. The 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada saw the debut of the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Peru, and Ghana. The 2014 Winter Olympics saw the debut of Dominica, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe. The 2018 Winter Olympics saw the debut of Ecuador, Eritrea, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Singapore. The 2022 Winter Olympics saw the debut of Haiti.\nList of participating tropical nations.\nThis list of nations includes those that lie entirely or predominantly within the tropical latitudes and also have a mostly tropical climate according to the Köppen climate classification system. Years of Winter Olympic Games participation are shown.\nOther warm-weather nations (located in the subtropics, for example) that have competed in the Winter Games include Australia (which has a tropical far north, and became the first Southern Hemisphere nation to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in 2002), Bermuda, Chinese Taipei, Eswatini, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, South Africa, Uruguay and several North African nations including Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.\nTonga sought to make its Winter Olympic debut at the 2010 Winter Olympics by entering a single competitor in luge, attracting some media attention, but he crashed in the final round of qualifying. Two years later, he attracted media attention again when it was discovered he had altered his name to that of one of his sponsors, a lingerie firm, as a marketing stunt. He was, at that time, in training to attempt to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nWinter Paralympic Games.\nAs of 2022, only three tropical nations have been represented at the Winter Paralympic Games. Tofiri Kibuuka of Uganda competed in cross-country skiing at the inaugural edition of the Winter Paralympics in 1976 and again at the 1980 Games. After Kibuuka obtained Norwegian nationality, he began to compete for Norway at the Paralympics starting in 1984, winning several medals in athletics at the Summer Paralympics. Brazil sent two athletes as part of its debut at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Puerto Rico sent one athlete as part of its debut at the 2022 Winter Paralympics.\nWinter Youth Olympic Games.\nFive tropical nations were represented at the First Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria."

        "title": "Wheelchair rugby league",
        "text": "Wheelchair rugby league is a wheelchair-based version of rugby league football, one of two recognised disability versions of the sport. It was developed in France in 2000. Unlike other wheelchair sports, people without disabilities are allowed to compete in top-level competition. The sport is also unique in the fact that men and women of any age can play against each other in top-level competition.\nHistory.\nWheelchair rugby league was developed by French rugby league players and coaches, Robert Fassolette and Wally Salvan, in 2000. The first competition was played by three teams, Vichy, Roanne and Beauvais, as part of a French Téléthon. Meetings establishing the official rules of the sport took place in 2002. The sport spread to the south of France with the establishment of teams from Perpignan, Cahors, and Montauban in 2004, and internationally after a tour by a French team to Australia and an exhibition match played in England in 2005. In May 2006, the RLIF accepted a proposal by France to endorse wheelchair rugby league and a month later the first test match was played between France and a touring Great Britain team. The first international between England and France took place in 2007 and the following year the inaugural World Cup was held in Australia.\nFrom its inception, until very recently, the top level of the sport was played no differently to other levels of the game. All matches took place in community sports halls, including international games, often with no-one in attendance. In 2013, the venue for the World Cup, Medway Park, had a crowd capacity of 500. However, following the 2021 World Cup (played in 2022), where the competition was given equal prominence with the men's and women's game, the popularity of the sport, both during and after the tournament, exploded. Games of the 2021 tournament, and following matches, have since been played in major areas in countries such as Australia, France, and the United Kingdom, often with several thousand in attendance. In the year following the 2021 World Cup, participation of the sport also rose by 71%.\nIn March 2024, wheelchair rugby league's first ever varsity fixture was played between Brunel University London and St Mary's University, Twickenham.\nGeography.\nThere are only nine countries with national wheelchair rugby league teams registered with the International Rugby League.\nRules.\nThe game shares many features with the regular rugby league:\nThe game then sees its own particular rules:\nInternational competitions.\nWorld Cup.\nThe inaugural Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup was held at indoor venues in Sydney, Australia in 2008. \nThe 2013 Wheelchair RL World Cup was held in Gillingham, England in July. It saw a tightly fought game with big collisions culminate in a victory for France. \nThe 2017 World Cup was held in the south of France in July. The holders, France, triumphed over a strong England side in another tightly fought contest.\nThe 2021 World Cup (played in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) took place in England with 8 teams, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, Spain, USA and Australia. For the USA this was to be their first major tournament. England defeated France 28–24 in the final in Manchester with an attendance of 4,526, the largest in the sport's history. Also, in a world first, all matches were broadcast by the BBC.\nEuropean Championship.\nThe Wheelchair Rugby League European Championship was first held in 2015 as a one off tournament. It is expected to occur every four years from 2023.\nCeltic Cup.\nThe Celtic Cup has been held annually since 2015 and features the three Celtic nations of the British Isles – Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.\nFassolette-Kielty Trophy.\nThe Fassolette-Kielty Trophy is a challenge competition between England and France, and is played for during all non-tournament tests.\nList of Clubs.\nEngland and Wales.\nThe British domestic league is one of the more established in the world with over twenty teams from across the country taking part. They feature in the RFL Wheelchair Super League, Championship League and then regional development leagues. Teams in Britain include:\nFrance.\nAs with the running variant of the sport, most of the French wheelchair rugby league teams are situated in the south of the country. A list of clubs include:\nScotland.\nUnlike the running game, the Scottish league is not integrated into the British rugby league system, however the teams have played in the all Great Britain Wheelchair Challenge Cup."

The team was organised by the Cuban Cricket Commission (CCC), which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002. However, the CCC had its membership revoked in 2013 for failing to adhere to ICC guidelines, so the team's current status is unclear.\nA Cuban representative team was assembled as early as 1952, when the Jamaica national cricket team toured. However, the popularity of the sport (played mainly by Afro-Cubans descended from West Indian sugar workers), diminished rapidly after the Cuban Revolution, and the game was not revived until the late 1990s. Cuba was invited to participate in the 2008 edition of the Stanford 20/20, and was drawn to play Sint Maarten in its preliminary round match. However, the U.S. embargo meant the team was forced to withdraw, as the tournament's primary organiser, Allen Stanford, was an American citizen. Despite the match being cancelled, it was still given the status of an official Twenty20 match. An eight-match tour of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was arranged as a replacement for the Stanford tournament, and Cuba won 2 of the 8 matches. Cuba were also invited to the 2010 Americas Championship Division Four tournament, played in Mexico, but again had to withdraw, having been prevented from leaving the country by the Cuban government."

Listed at 5' 9\", 175 lb., Robinson batted and threw right-handed. \nA native of Barberton, Ohio, Robinson played college baseball for Florida State University. In 1991, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Robinson was selected by the Blue Jays in the 10th round (276th overall) of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft.\nOver the course of Robinson’s three-season major league career, he posted a 2–2 record, with a 3.91 earned run average (ERA), while recording no saves (SV) in one save opportunity (SVO), across 29 pitching appearances, all in relief.\nRobinson was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks on February 17, 1998. He died in Tucson, Arizona in a traffic collision during spring training on February 28, 1999. Robinson was 29. A teammate, minor leaguer John Rosengren, had been driving the vehicle involved in the accident; he was charged with second-degree murder due to being under the influence of alcohol. Key evidence in the case was thrown out because police did not allow Rosengren to call his father (who was an attorney) after the collision, and he returned to playing baseball."

This indicator is essentially a plus-minus statistic that measures shot attempts (usually only counting those at even strength). A player receives a plus for any shot attempt (on net, missed, or blocked) that his team directs at \nthe opponent's net, and a minus for any shot attempt against his own net. This indicator is widely used in most NHL teams as it has shown a strong correlation to player and team success. The person credited with popularizing the statistic, Vic Ferrari, attributed the stat to then-Sabres general manager Darcy Regier, but named it after Corsi because he thought Corsi's name had a better ring to it (he was inadvertently correct since Corsi did create the statistic). Corsi himself has stated he is flattered to be associated with the statistic.\nHe was relieved of his duties with the St. Louis Blues on February 1, 2017.\nTeams.\nSoccer\nHockey"

The league champion, Penn, refused to comply with an NCAA edict that all teams must certify a 1.6 GPA for all student-athletes; the Ivy League and the university did not believe that the NCAA had the power to dictate such things, and as such the team was banned. They would have played Syracuse in the East regional at Blacksburg.\nThis was the only NCAA tournament between 1961 and 1982 which did not include UCLA.\nGame summaries.\nThe Tournament is most remembered for the all-black starting five of Texas Western defeating an all-white starting five for Kentucky in the championship game.\nClem Haskins and Dwight Smith became the first black athletes to integrate the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball program in the Fall of 1963. This put Western Kentucky at the forefront to integrate college basketball in the Southeast. The Western Kentucky Hilltoppers were 2 points away from defeating Michigan and meeting the University of Kentucky Wildcats in the Mideast regional final.

But the Bruins did not cruise through the season in their accustomed fashion. They were severely threatened in their own conference (and backyard) by second-ranked USC, who lost only twice all season – both to UCLA. In addition, UCLA lost at Notre Dame and had several other close calls against Washington, Oregon, and Oregon State. In the West Regional final, the Bruins trailed Long Beach State by 11 points midway through the second half, and their star player Sidney Wicks was on the bench with four personal fouls. But Wicks returned and avoided his fifth foul (and disqualification), and the Bruins rallied to take a 55–53 lead. With 20 seconds remaining, Wicks sank two clinching free throws and UCLA escaped 57–55.\nIn the national championship game, UCLA jumped out to an early lead, but star players Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe struggled against Villanova's stingy zone defense. Only the outside shooting of Henry Bibby and a career best 29 points from center Steve Patterson kept the Bruins in the lead. In the meantime, Villanova stars Howard Porter and Chris Ford overcame early struggles to keep the Wildcats in the game. Midway through the second half, UCLA coach John Wooden ordered the Bruins to go into a four-corner stall offense (there was no shot clock in college basketball at this time), a tactic he rarely employed. Wooden said after the game he did so to bring Villanova out of their zone, and because he wanted to use the stage of the national championship game to show the NCAA that they should adopt a shot clock (something Wooden had long argued for). However, the tactic almost backfired as Villanova started forcing turnovers with an aggressive man-to-man defense. In addition, the stall took UCLA out of its offensive rhythm. Villanova closed the gap to 63–60 and had the ball with one minute to play. However, Porter missed a 15-foot off-balance jumper, Wicks grabbed the rebound, and UCLA made 5 of 6 free throws down the stretch to win 68–62.\nIn the national third-place game, Western Kentucky defeated Kansas, 77–75.\nIn a situation similar to Villanova's, Western Kentucky's placement in the tournament was vacated due to an NCAA investigation that showed Jim McDaniels had signed a professional contract and accepted money during the 1970–71 season. Western Kentucky would be found in violation twice more in the next 10 years, earning the school a \"lack of institutional control\" violation. This made the 1971 Final Four officially the first without a school from east of the Mississippi River. The 2021 Final Four is the first to actually have all four teams come from west of the Mississippi (Baylor, Gonzaga, Houston and UCLA).\nThe total attendance for the tournament was 220,447, a new record. The crowd of 31,765 for the championship game was also a new record.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1971 tournament:\nFirst round\nRegional semifinals, 3rd-place games, and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals, 3rd-place game, and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nCurt Gowdy, Tom Hawkins, and Jim Simpson (Final Four only) - First Round at Notre Dame, Indiana (Marquette-Miami Ohio, Western Kentucky-Jacksonville); Mideast Regional Final at Athens, Georgia; Final Four in Houston, Texas"

USL's program was shut down for the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons, all other Ragin Cajun' athletic programs were placed on three years' probation and banned from postseason participation, and the university was stripped of voting rights at the NCAA convention until 1977 (the NCAA originally planned to expel USL from the organization, but that sanction was downgraded in January 1974).\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1973 tournament:\nFirst round\nRegional semifinals, 3rd-place games, and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals, 3rd-place game, and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAftermath.\nThe 1973 NC State Wolfpack team averaged 93 points per game (ppg), led the nation in win margin (21.8 ppg), and posted a 27–0 record, but was ineligible for postseason play because of NCAA probation.

        "text": "The 1974 NCAA Division I basketball tournament involved 25 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball. It was the first tournament to be designated as a Division I championship—previously, NCAA member schools had been divided into the \"University Division\" and \"College Division\". The NCAA created its current three-division setup, effective with the 1973–74 academic year, by moving all of its University Division schools to Division I and splitting the College Division members into Division II (fewer scholarships) and Division III (no athletic scholarships allowed). Previous tournaments would retroactively be considered Division I championships.\nThe tournament began on March 9, 1974, and ended with the championship game on March 25 in Greensboro, North Carolina. Until 2019, when Virginia defeated Texas Tech, it was the last tournament in which neither school had previously appeared in any national championship game at any level. A total of 29 games were played, including a third-place game in each region and a national third-place game.\nNorth Carolina State, coached by Norm Sloan, won the national title with a 76–64 victory in the final game over Marquette, coached by Al McGuire. This result ended UCLA's record streak of seven consecutive titles. David Thompson of North Carolina State was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThis was the final year that only conference champions and independents could participate in the tournament. During the same time in 1974, the Collegiate Commissioners' Association held a tournament in St. Louis, Missouri. They invited the second-place teams from eight conferences to participate. In 1975, the NCAA would expand the field to include at-large bids for conference runners-up.\nTournament notes.\nThe UCLA – North Carolina State semifinal game made \"USA Today\"s 2002 list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time at #13. UCLA star Bill Walton calls that game the most disappointing outcome of his entire basketball career, given how UCLA lost a 5-point lead late in regulation and a 7-point lead in the 2nd overtime, before NC State rallied to win, 80–77. The game, played in Greensboro, was like a home game for the Wolfpack; UCLA had defeated NC State by 18 points in a neutral site game in St. Louis (where UCLA defeated Memphis State the previous March to win its seventh consecutive national championship) earlier in the season.\nThe Wolfpack became the fifth team in history to win the national championship playing in its home state. CCNY won the 1950 NCAA championship (as well as the NIT championship) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Kentucky won the 1958 championship at Freedom Hall in Louisville, and UCLA won both the 1968 and 1972 championships at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. UCLA also would win the 1975 championship in its home state, at the San Diego Sports Arena. No team has accomplished the feat since then, although the Kansas Jayhawks won the 1988 championship in nearby Kansas City, Missouri, at Kemper Arena, which is closer to the KU campus in Lawrence, Kansas than Greensboro is to Raleigh.\nThis was the last Sweet Sixteen appearance for Creighton and Oral Roberts until the 2021 tournament, when both teams returned for the first time in 47 years.\nThanks in large part to the reclassification of Division I, the 1974 tournament is the last tournament to include a team no longer in Division I. The Cal State Los Angeles Golden Eagles spent one year in the modern Division I, winning the Pacific Coast Athletic Association before dropping to Division II.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1974 tournament:\nFirst round\nRegional semifinals, 3rd-place games, and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals, 3rd-place game, and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAnnouncers.\nCurt Gowdy, Tom Hawkins, Charlie Jones, and Ross Porter - First Round at Terre Haute, Indiana (Marquette-Ohio, Notre Dame-Austin Peay) Final Four at Greensboro, North Carolina; Jones was used as a sideline reporter for the first round and Porter was used for the Final Four."

Kent Benson of Indiana was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nNotably, this was the first time that two teams from the same conference (the Big Ten) played in the title game. (As of 2024, all four of the 1976 Final Four participants will be members of the Big Ten.) Also, this was the last men's Division I tournament to date to feature two unbeaten teams, as both Indiana and Rutgers entered the tournament unbeaten. To date, Indiana is the last team to go the entire season undefeated at 32–0. Both advanced to the Final Four, with Indiana winning the title and Rutgers losing to Michigan in the semifinals and UCLA in the third-place game. This had been the last tournament both Duke and Kentucky missed in the same year until 2021. \nThis tournament was also the first since the creation of the NCAA men's tournament in 1939 in which no regional third-place games were played. In the first two NCAA tournaments (1939 and 1940), the West Regional held a third-place game, but the East (the only other regional of that day) did not. The East began holding its own third-place game in 1941, and from that point through 1975 each regional held a third-place game.

It began on March 11, 1978, and ended with the championship game on March 27 in St. Louis, Missouri. A total of 32 games were played, including a national third-place game.\nThe process of seeding the bracket was first used in this tournament. Sixteen conference winners with automatic bids were seeded 1 through 4 in each region. At-large teams were seeded 1 through 4 in each region separately. There were in fact only eleven true at-large teams in the field, as the remaining five were conference winners with automatic bids and seeded The practice of distinguishing between automatic and at-large teams ended with this edition; the expanded field of forty in the 1979 tournament was simply seeded from one to ten in each of the four regions.\nLed by head coach Joe B. Hall, Kentucky won its fifth national title with a 94–88 victory over Duke, coached by Bill Foster. Wildcat forward Jack Givens scored 41 points in the finale and was named the tournament's most outstanding player.\nThe bracket's biggest upset came in the first round, when little-heralded Miami (Ohio) defeated defending champion Marquette 84-81 in overtime. The victory was even sweeter for Miami Redskins (now RedHawks) fans as former Marquette coach Al McGuire had earlier strongly criticized the NCAA for potentially matching Marquette against Kentucky in the second round, with Marquette being given a first-round opponent in Miami that was supposedly not even worthy of providing an adequate tune-up game.\nUnranked Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) pulled off two upsets, first over 4th ranked New Mexico (coached by Norm Ellenberger and led by Michael Cooper) and then over top-10 San Francisco (featuring Bill Cartwright). The loss was especially painful for New Mexico as the regional semifinals and finals were held on the Lobos' home court in Albuquerque. CSUF then almost upset Arkansas in the West Regional final, losing by 3 points. In each of the three games, the Titans overcame second-half double-digit deficits. In the Arkansas game, they cut a big deficit to 1 and had the ball with 14 seconds left. But Arkansas' Ron Brewer stripped the ball from Keith Anderson and Jim Counce drove down to hit a clinching layup.\nIn the Mideast regional final, Kentucky knocked off Michigan State, led by freshman Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. This was the only time in a 4-year period (that included his senior year in high school, 2 years of college, and his rookie NBA season) that Magic's team did not win its final game of the playoffs and hence the championship.\nThe Final Four games (semifinals, third-place, and championship) at St. Louis Arena (a.k.a. The Checkerdome) were not played on the arena's official floor. Water damage to it forced the NCAA to borrow the floor from Indiana University's Assembly Hall in Bloomington.\nThis was the fourth and last year for a 32-team bracket; the field expanded to forty teams in 1979 and 48 in 1980, all seeded.

It began on March 9 and ended with the championship game on March 26 in Salt Lake City. A total of 40 games were played, including a national third-place game. This was the tournament's only edition with forty teams; the previous year's had 32, and it expanded to 48 in 1980. The 1979 Indiana State team was the last squad to reach a national title game with an undefeated record for 42 years; their achievement was finally matched by the 2021 Gonzaga Bulldogs, who reached that year's title contest against Baylor with a 31-0 record.\nMichigan State, coached by Jud Heathcote, won the national title with a 75–64 victory in the final game over Indiana State, coached by Bill Hodges. Indiana State came into the game undefeated, but could not extend their winning streak. Magic Johnson of Michigan State was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Michigan State's victory over Indiana State was its first over a top-ranked team, and remained its only victory over a number one ranked team until 2007 (Wisconsin).\nThe final game marked the beginning of the rivalry between future Hall of Famers Johnson and Larry Bird. As of 2021, it remains the highest-rated game in the history of televised college basketball. Both Johnson and Bird would enter the NBA in the fall of 1979, and the rivalry between them and their teams (respectively, the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics) was a major factor in the league's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s. The game also led to the \"modern era\" of college basketball, as it introduced a nationwide audience to a sport that was once relegated to second-class status in the sports world. This was also the first tournament where unique logos for the event were introduced, creating a diversity of branding which lasts to the present day.\nWith the loss in the championship game, Indiana State has finished as the national runner-up in the NAIA (1946, 1948), NCAA Division II (1968), and NCAA Division I (1979) tournaments, making them the only school to do so.\nThis was the first tournament in which all teams were seeded by the Division I Basketball Committee. The top six seeds in each regional received byes to the second round, while seeds 7–10 played in the first round.\nIt is also notable as the last Final Four played in an on-campus arena, at the University of Utah. (The most recent tournament to be held on a university's \"premises\" (i.e. not on the university's main campus, but on a satellite or branch campus) was in 1983, as the University of New Mexico (UNM) hosted that year's tournament in The Pit (then officially known as University Arena), which is located on the UNM South Campus.) It has, however, been played in a team's regular off-campus home arena three times since then: in 1985 at Rupp Arena, Kentucky's home court, in 1994 at Charlotte Coliseum, UNCC’s home court, and in 1996 at Continental Airlines Arena, then Seton Hall's home court. Given the use of domed stadiums for Final Fours for the foreseeable future, it is likely this will be the \"last\" Final Four on a college campus. This tournament was the last until the 2019 tournament to see two finalists playing for the national championship for the first time. The 1979 Final Four was the first in which all four schools came from east of the Mississippi River.\nThis was the first NCAA tournament where three officials were assigned to all games. Several conferences, including the Big Ten and Southeastern, used three officials for its regular season games prior to the NCAA adopting it universally.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1979 tournament:\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals, 3rd-place game, and championship (Final Four and championship)\nTournament notes.\nIn the East, the Round of 32 was called Black Sunday because of Penn's upset of number 1 North Carolina and St. John's upset of number 2-seeded Duke, both in Raleigh. Penn went all the way to the Final Four before losing to eventual champion Michigan State. Both teams had to defeat higher-seeded opponents in the Round of 40 to have the chance to beat UNC and Duke. Penn beat three higher-seeded opponents to reach the Final Four, a feat which was later bettered in 1986 by LSU, 2006 by George Mason, and 2011 by Virginia Commonwealth, who each beat four higher-seeded opponents on the way to the Final Four."

However, with under a minute left, the Hawks had rallied to within one point, 48–47. Blue Demons guard Skip Dillard was fouled with 13 seconds left. Dillard was known as 'Money' for his superb free throw shooting, but he missed the front end of a one-and-one opportunity, and St. Joseph's got the rebound, then quickly passed the ball to the front court without calling a timeout. Guard Bryan Warrick got the ball to freshman Lonnie McFarlan who was wide open in the right corner. McFarlan began to shoot until forward John Smith yelled \"Please!\" to him. McFarlan passed to Smith, who was open underneath the basket. Smith's layup with two seconds left enabled the Hawks of coach Jim Lynam to stun the Blue Demons of Ray Meyer, 49–48.\nLater in the afternoon in Austin, Texas, Arkansas coach Eddie Sutton called timeout with 5 seconds left after falling behind Louisville in the Midwest Region, 73–72 on a jumper by guard Derek Smith. Sutton told his team to get the ball to U.S. Reed. The Razorbacks' guard dribbled to near half court, then launched a 49-foot shot that beat the buzzer and swished through the net, as Arkansas dethroned the defending national champion Cardinals of Denny Crum, 74–73. Sutton told the media, \"Champions die hard.\"\nOnly moments after the Razorbacks' upset, the season ended for another #1 seed in the West Region in Los Angeles. Oregon State led Kansas State by as much as 11 points in the second half. Coach Ralph Miller and center Steve Johnson had led the Beavers to a two-year record of 52–4. Then Rolando Blackman led the Wildcats back with a 16–6 run to tie the game, 48–48 with 3:23 left. Johnson then fouled out, and both teams stalled with the ball until Oregon State missed the front end of a one-and-one from the foul line. K-State then held for the last shot. With two seconds left, Blackman, double-teamed, drilled a fall-away 17 footer from the right baseline for a 50–48 upset by the Wildcats of Jack Hartman.\nIn another second round Mideast Region upset, UAB defeated Kentucky 69–62. A semifinal in the East Region saw Danny Ainge dribble the length of the court and drive all the way in for a layup and another buzzer-beating winner, lifting BYU over Notre Dame 51–50.\nGreg Johnson of \"NCAA.com\", in a March 9, 2011 article, indicated that March 14, 1981 was a date which defined March Madness.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1981 tournament:\nFirst and Second rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)"

        "title": "1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 52 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball. It began on March 17, 1983, and ended with the championship game on April 4 at The Pit, then officially known as University Arena, on the campus of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. A total of 51 games were played.\nNorth Carolina State, coached by Jim Valvano, won the national title with a 54–52 victory in the final game over Houston, coached by Guy Lewis. The ending of the final game is one of the most famous in college basketball history, with a buzzer-beating dunk by Lorenzo Charles off a desperation shot from 30 feet out by Dereck Whittenburg. This would also be NC State's last appearance in the Final Four until 2024. \nBoth Charles's dunk and Valvano's running around the court in celebration immediately after the game have been staples of NCAA tournament coverage ever since. North Carolina State's victory has often been considered one of the greatest upsets in college basketball history, and is the fourth biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history.\nAkeem Olajuwon of Houston was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, becoming the last player to date to earn this award while playing for a team that failed to win the national title.\nNational championship game.\nIn the final game, played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, NC State led at halftime by a score of 33–25. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star Clyde Drexler, who picked up four first half fouls. In the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game, eventually taking a seven-point lead.\nHowever, things were not all good for Houston. Since the game was played in Albuquerque, players had to deal with the city's mile-high altitude. The Cougars' star center, Hakeem Olajuwon, had problems adjusting to the environment and tired quickly, needing to check out of the game multiple times so he could put on an oxygen mask and recover. With Olajuwon on the bench, Houston head coach Guy Lewis decided that in order to protect the lead and the health of his big man at the same time, the Cougars needed to start slowing the game down.\nOnce again, this enabled the Wolfpack to return to their standby strategy of extending the game. Houston's free throw shooting was very suspect entering the game, which worked greatly in NC State's favor as they were able to rally back and even the score at 52 in the final two minutes. On what would be the last Houston possession, Valvano called for his players to back off and let freshman guard Alvin Franklin bring the ball up the court. The Wolfpack defenders would let the Cougars employ their slowdown strategy of passing it around. Once the ball got back to Franklin he was to be fouled immediately. With 1:05 left, the freshman was fouled and sent to the line for a one-and-one. The idea to foul Franklin sprung from the enormity of the moment; NC State believed that the relatively inexperienced Franklin could not withstand the pressure of going to the line with the championship at stake and knowing that fifty million viewers were tuned in to watch the game. The theory proved correct as Franklin failed to convert and the Wolfpack grabbed the rebound. Valvano called timeout with 44 seconds left and drew up a play for senior guard Dereck Whittenburg during the timeout, which called for the team to pass him the ball with ten seconds left on the clock so he could take the final shot.\nHouston needed a defensive stop so they could get another chance to close out the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court zone trap defense. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control of the ball. The ball eventually wound up in the hands of guard Sidney Lowe, who gave it to forward and fellow senior Thurl Bailey in the corner.\nTrying to keep the ball moving, as he had been double teamed as soon as he received the pass, Bailey looked back toward Whittenburg, who was approximately thirty feet away from the hoop near midcourt. Bailey threw what Whittenburg would later call a \"poor fundamental\" overhanded pass which Houston's Benny Anders, guarding Whittenburg on the play, was in position to steal. At this point, Whittenburg hearkened back to his high school days with Morgan Wootten at DeMatha Catholic High School, where he was taught to always catch the basketball with both hands. If Whittenburg had not attempted to do so in this case, Anders may have gotten the steal and a game-winning breakaway layup. In college basketball at the time, the game clock continued to run after a made field goal, and the Wolfpack likely would not have had time even to inbound the ball. As it was, Anders knocked the ball out of Whittenburg's hands, but Whittenburg quickly regained control.\nThe clock, meanwhile, had ticked down to five seconds and Whittenburg was still standing a significant distance from the goal. Once he regained control, Whittenburg turned and launched a desperation shot, later claimed by Whittenburg to be a pass, to try and win the game for NC State. The shot's trajectory took it to the front of the basket where Olajuwon was covering Wolfpack center Lorenzo Charles. As he watched the shot, Olajuwon said he knew the shot was going to come up short but he also did not want to go for the ball too early because of the potential for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the indecision by Olajuwon and went up for the air ball, and, in one motion, he scored the go-ahead points with a two-handed dunk. The final second ticked off the clock before Houston could inbound the ball (the rule which stops the clock on a made basket in the last minute of the second half and any overtime period(s) was not adopted until the 1993-94 season), and with that, the game ended, and the Wolfpack were the national champions.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1983 tournament:\nOpening Round\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nTournament notes.\nThe Louisville vs. Houston semi-final was a matchup of the #1 vs. #2 team. The #1 ranked Houston Cougars (nicknamed Phi Slama Jama) vs. #2 the Louisville Cardinals (nicknamed \"The Doctors of Dunk\") was considered likely to produce the national champion. It featured two strong offensive teams that specialized in the slam dunk. Both teams put on a show of offense, with Houston winning out over Louisville 94-81. This would have been the biggest game of the tournament had it not been eclipsed by the North Carolina State win over Houston in the championship game.\nAnother historically significant game in this tournament was the Mideast Regional final between Kentucky and Louisville, in-state rivals that had not played one another in basketball since the 1959 NCAA tournament, and had not played in the regular season since 1922. After regulation time ended with Kentucky tying the game at the buzzer, Louisville dominated the overtime to advance to the Final Four. This result directly led to the start of the Battle for the Bluegrass annual basketball series between the two schools that November.\nA historically significant run in the tournament was that of Georgia, who became the last team to date to advance to the Final Four in its first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance. But the N.C. State team led by Jim Valvano became the archetype of the \"Cinderella team\", the underdog that many fans look to as a possible spoiler over top-ranked teams. This label has, since then, been applied to many programs, including Villanova in 1985, Gonzaga in 1999, George Mason in 2006, Butler in 2010 and 2011, VCU in 2011, Wichita State in 2013, Loyola Chicago in 2018, UCLA in 2021, Saint Peter's in 2022 and Florida Atlantic in 2023. Not only did N.C. State beat Houston to win the championship, but they also beat #1 seeded Virginia on their way to the Final Four. The Wolfpack did not assure themselves of a tournament bid until they upset Virginia in the championship game of the ACC tournament. North Carolina State became the first team in tournament history to win six games en route to the title (the tournament being 32 teams or fewer prior to 1979, and all champions from 1979 to 1982 had first-round byes).\nChristopher Cross' \"All Right\" accompanied the highlight montage at the end of CBS' broadcast of the championship game."

        "text": "The 1984 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 53 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball. It began on March 13, 1984, and ended with the championship game on April 2 in Seattle. A total of 52 games were played. This was the last tournament in which some teams earned first-round byes as the field expanded to 64 teams beginning in the 1985 tournament when each team played in the first round. It was also the second year with a preliminary round; preliminary games would not be played again until 2001.\nGeorgetown, coached by John Thompson, won the national title with an 84–75 victory in the final game over Houston, coached by Guy Lewis. Patrick Ewing of Georgetown was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Thompson became the first African-American head coach to lead his team to any NCAA Division I title.\nGeorgetown reached the Final Four for the third time in school history and second time in three years to face Kentucky, a team that had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the \"Twin Towers\", Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Bowie and Turpin managed to get Ewing into foul trouble early, and with him on the bench and Reggie Williams shooting only 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field during the game, the Wildcats raced out to a 27–15 lead with 3:06 left in the first half. After that, however, the Hoyas made a defensive stand still unequalled in college basketball: Kentucky scored only two more points in the first half; the Wildcats also did not score in the first 9 minutes 55 seconds of the second half, missing their first 12 shots and after that shooting 3-for-21 (14.3%) during the remainder of the game. Overall, Kentucky shot 3-for-33 (9.1 percent) from the field during the second half. Although he played for only 17 minutes and suffered a season-ending foot injury in the second half, Gene Smith had one of the best defensive games of his career. Bowie and Turpin finished the game a combined 5-for-21, Wingate scored 12 points and held Kentucky's Jim Master to 2-for-7 (28.6%) shooting from the field, Michael Jackson scored 12 points and pulled down a career-high 10 rebounds, and Georgetown won 53–40 to advance to the national final for the third time in school history and second time in three years.\nIn the first national semifinal, Houston, playing in its third consecutive Final Four, edged Virginia, which reached the Final Four as a No. 7 seed in the East region, 49–47. The Cavaliers reached the national semifinals despite the graduation of four-time All-American Ralph Sampson the previous season. Coincidentally, Houston's All-America center, Akeem Olajuwon, would soon become Sampson's teammate with the Houston Rockets.\nIn the NCAA final, Georgetown faced Houston on April 2. Reggie Williams demonstrated his true potential for the first time, putting in a strong defensive performance and shooting 9-for-18 (50.0%) from the field with 19 points and seven rebounds in the game, while David Wingate scored 16 points and Ewing managed 10 points and nine rebounds. Jackson scored 11 points and had six assists, two of which set up Ewing and Michael Graham for decisive baskets late in the game. The game was decided well before the final whistle, and the Hoyas won the school's first national championship 84–75. Late in the game, with Georgetown enjoying a comfortable lead, Thompson began to pull starters out and give bench players some time on the court; the game's enduring image came when senior guard Fred Brown came out of the game. Two years earlier, Brown had mistakenly passed the ball to North Carolina's James Worthy in the last seconds of the 1982 championship game, ruining Georgetown's chances for a final game-winning shot and allowing North Carolina to take the national championship, and cameras had captured Thompson consoling a devastated Brown with a hug as the Tar Heels celebrated. As Brown left the 1984 championship game, cameras caught Brown and Thompson again embracing on the sideline, this time to celebrate a victory.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 1984 tournament, and their host(s):\nOpening Round\nFirst/Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen/Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nBroadcast information.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports\nESPN/NCAA Productions"

        "text": "The 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs for the National Hockey League (NHL) championship began on April 21, 2006, following the 2005–06 regular season. This was the first playoffs since 2004 due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout that cancelled the previously scheduled season. The 16 teams that qualified, seeded one through eight from each conference, played best-of-seven series with re-seeding after the Conference quarterfinals. The conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup.\nThe Finals concluded on June 19 with the Carolina Hurricanes winning the Stanley Cup, defeating the Edmonton Oilers in the final series four games to three. Carolina goaltender Cam Ward was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. The Edmonton Oilers would miss the playoffs each year thereafter until 2017. This was also the last time until 2023 that the Pittsburgh Penguins missed the playoffs. The St. Louis Blues missed the playoffs for the first time since 1980, ending a 25-season playoff streak, the third longest in NHL history. The current longest playoff streak moved to the Detroit Red Wings at 15 consecutive seasons. This was additionally the first time in history that the Chicago Blackhawks and the St. Louis Blues missed the playoffs in the same season.\nWhile the 2005–06 season introduced a shootout to break ties after five minutes of four-on-four overtime, the Stanley Cup playoffs retained their traditional format of unlimited 20-minute periods of five-on-five sudden-death overtime to break ties.\nThe Western Conference made history in the first round when all four series were won by the lower-seeded teams (conversely, all four series in the Eastern Conference were won by the higher-seeded teams). The eighth- and lowest-seeded Oilers proceeded to win the Western Conference and participate in the Stanley Cup Finals. Four Canadian teams qualified for the playoffs this year, this total was not equaled again until 2013 and not exceeded until 2015 with five.\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Ottawa Senators vs. (8) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe Ottawa Senators entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference regular season and Northeast Division champions with 113 points.

        "title": "Mike Davis (baseball)",
        "text": "Michael Dwayne Davis (born June 11, 1959) is an American former professional baseball right fielder. He played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1980 to 1989 for the Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was selected by the Athletics in the third round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft and signed as a free agent with the Dodgers before the 1988 season. He is most remembered as the Dodger who earned a two-out walk in the bottom of the ninth of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, stole second base, and ultimately scored on Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run that won the game. The Dodgers would go on to win the series, four games to one.\nDavis debuted for the Oakland Athletics in 1980 and played eight seasons for the team. From 1985 to 1987, his three best statistical seasons, he hit 65 home runs, collected 209 RBI's, and hit for a .274 average. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 1987 season.\nIn 1988, Davis fought through an injury in spring training and largely struggled in his first National League season, hitting .196 with only two home runs and 17 runs batted in.\nIn Game 1 of that season's World Series, Davis was called upon to pinch hit against his former team with two outs in the ninth inning and the Dodgers trailing, 4-3. He faced A's closer, Dennis Eckersley, who led the league in saves that year. After throwing a first-pitch strike, Eckersley pitched carefully around his former teammate, which he later attributed in part due to Davis' power-hitting when they were teammates the year prior. With light-hitting Dave Anderson in the on deck circle, he threw the next four pitches well outside to walk Davis. Anderson was then pulled for pinch hitter Kirk Gibson, the Dodgers' best offensive weapon during the year but severely hobbled with injuries to both legs. With the count 2-2 to Gibson, Davis stole second base easily; controversy nearly ensued when Ron Hassey grazed an off-balance Gibson in his throwing motion to second base, but he did not make the throw, and interference was not called. On the next pitch, Gibson hit a now-famous home run to give the Dodgers a 5-4 win. In post-game interviews, Gibson credited Davis' steal for changing his approach to just seeking a base hit.\nIn the fourth inning of Game 5, he launched a two-run homer off Storm Davis on a 3-0 pitch to give the Dodgers a 4-1 lead. The Dodgers would go on to win 5-2 to clinch the series; Davis' homer provided the decisive runs in the game. It was his only hit of the series, but he also walked four times, stole two bases, and scored three runs, finishing with a .455 on-base percentage. He retired after the 1989 season.\nDavis served as the hitting coach for the Clinton LumberKings, Class-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners for the 2015 season. He served as the manager of the California High School baseball varsity team in San Ramon, California, for the 1993 season.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac, or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota"

        "title": "Roy Rubin (basketball)",
        "text": "Roy Rubin (December 9, 1925 – August 5, 2013) was a former college and professional basketball coach.\nCareer as coach.\nRubin played college basketball while attending University of Louisville from 1949 to 1951. He coached the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers — at the time, the worst team (a 9–73 win–loss record) in the history of the NBA — for the first 51 games of the season. His record was 4–47.\nRubin coached at Christopher Columbus High School in New York City, where he led the team to six borough championships in the Public Schools Athletic League in nine seasons. He was known as a defensive genius, and had even written a book on how to play defense. \nHe was the athletic director and head basketball coach at Long Island University (LIU), compiling a 174–94 record in eleven seasons.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nRubin left his positions at LIU to sign a three‐year contract to head coach the Philadelphia 76ers on June 15, 1972. He succeeded Jack Ramsay who had resigned three months earlier after the ballclub finished third in the Atlantic Division at 30–52 and missed the playoffs for the first time in franchise history (dating to their time as the Syracuse Nationals from 1946 to 1963). The 76ers were only six years removed from winning an NBA title with the most wins in league history at the time, but had fallen so far that Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp had declined offers to take over the team. The Sixers were so desperate to find a coach that they actually took out an ad in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer,\" which was seen by one of Rubin's friends, stockbroker Jules Love.\nRubin joined a team whose only holdover from its championship run six seasons earlier was aging veteran Hal Greer. Rubin's introductory press conference occurred almost simultaneous to the ones held in Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina in which Billy Cunningham announced that he was going to play with the American Basketball Association's Carolina Cougars beginning with the upcoming season. An 0–15 start started a watch of just how bad the team could get. It took him a month to get a win, and he would only win three more times after that. After 51 games and a 4–47 record—and while in the midst of what would become a (then)-record 20-game losing streak—Rubin was fired in favor of player-coach Kevin Loughery on January 23, 1973. However, according to ESPN, Rubin had lost the team before then; the players reportedly considered Loughery their on-court leader as early as Christmas.\nSeveral players on the team believed that Rubin was in over his head as an NBA head coach. They claimed he ran sloppy practices and never said anything meaningful during timeouts, halftime or postgame meetings. For example, he suggested that all the players needed to do to get ready for the season was run full-court, one-on-one games for 48 minutes. Years later, one of the players on that team, Fred Carter, said that letting Rubin coach the Sixers was \"like letting a teenager run a big corporation.\" Later, Carter told ESPN that he concluded Rubin wasn't cut out to be an NBA head coach when he was in high spirits after a preseason win over the Eastern Conference finalist Boston Celtics even though the Celtics had mostly played their third stringers.\n\"Tough to Get Help\".\nA month prior to signing with the 76ers, Rubin was one of the producers of the Broadway comedy \"Tough to Get Help\". It was written by Steve Gordon, directed by Carl Reiner, starred John Amos and Dick O'Neill and also featured Abe Vigoda. The comedy was about a black couple who worked as a gardener (Amos) and a cook (Lillian Hayman) for a white liberal advertising executive (O'Neill) and his wife (Billie Lou Watt) and the homecoming of their militant son (John Danelle).\nIts reviews were unfavorable. The only criticism from Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" was directed at Gordon. He explained, \"...The play, with interminable and unfunny dream sequences, with dialogue that seems to have been picked up wholesale from a TV situation comedy and characters of no real comic depth or perception, does not have a great deal going for it.\" His critique was published the day after the comedy opened and closed with only one performance at the Royale Theatre on May 4, 1972.\nLater life.\nRubin moved to Florida, eventually owned an International House of Pancakes restaurant, and never coached another game of basketball. He died of cancer in Miami in 2013. He was survived by his wife, Marsha."

        "text": "Peter Rasmussen (born 2 August 1974) is a Danish badminton player. A former World Champion and European Champion, Rasmussen ranks among the best Danish badminton players of all time.\nCareer.\nThe crowning achievement of his career was winning the Men's Singles at the 1997 IBF World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. It was the first time a Dane and a non- Asian player captured that title since Flemming Delfs won at the first-ever IBF World Championships held in Sweden in 1977. The \"Men's Finals in 1997\" is regarded as one of the best badminton matches played ever because of both the duration and quality of the match. In the end, Peter Rasmussen's opponent, Sun Jun of China cramped up and could barely continue. Rasmussen capitalized on the opportunity and closed out his three-game victory, 16-17, 18-13, 15-10.\nRasmussen has often been called \"Den Hvide Kineser\" or \"The White Chinaman\". This is not only due to his playing style which featured speedy footwork and powerful jump-smashes (typically a hallmark of Chinese badminton players), but also because of his spiritual interests. He educated himself in acupuncture and practiced it to help overcome injures. He studied Miyamoto Musashi and believed in a philosophy of \"strategy\", rather than one of \"results\" which he saw as predominant among elite players.\nAt the 1999 China Open, Rasmussen knocked out the 16-year old Lin Dan in the first round 6-15, 15-8, 15-4. This was to be their only career encounter, making Rasmussen one of the select few players with a winning head-to-head over the Chinese.\nRasmussen suffered a career ending foot injury on 25 September 2004, during the Men's Singles Final of the 2004 U.S. Open (badminton). He was forced to retire while leading the score 12-7 in the first game against Lee Yen Hui Kendrick. He attempted to rehabilitate but on 9 February 2005 he announced his retirement from international competition due to lack of progress.\nThe final match he played for the Danish national team was in the 2004 Thomas Cup semi-finals. Denmark and Indonesia were tied 2-2, and \"Peter Rasmussen vs Simon Santoso\" would decide who advanced to the finals against China. Rasmussen won the match in straight sets, 15-3, 15-12. Rasmussen considers this match, in front of 12,000 Indonesian spectators, to be the highlight of his career.\nPeter Rasmussen was sponsored by Carlton, which marketed a lineup of racquets bearing his name, including the Rasmussen Titanium, Rasmussen Lite, Rasmussen Superlite, and the Rasmussen Tour. His racquet of choice was the Rasmussen Superlite. Due to his retirement, the Rasmussen lineup has reverted to the previous designation of Airblade. Prior to introducing this lineup of rackets, he used the Carlton AS-1 Ti.\nUpon his retirement, Rasmussen set his sights on finishing his degree in medicine. He was also thinking about creating a website about his mental approach to badminton.\nMusashi and Bushido.\nPeter claims that the reason why he was so successful on the badminton court was because of his studies of Bushido, an ancient Japanese philosophy and his mentor, Miyamoto Musashi, a great samurai. Miyamoto Musashi began his “warrior’s pilgrimage” at age 13 when he began to train as a swordsmen and as a practicing Bushido Warrior. Legend claims that he killed his first opponent at age 14 in one of the 60 duels he fought over his lifetime. It is said that he was never defeated, both in single combat and during the 6 wars, in which he took part. At age 35, Musashi sheathed his sword to become a mentor, an artist and finally a writer, who penned one of Japan’s most influential pieces of literature – “The Book of the Five Rings.” Rasmussen had to face the fact of losing before he can entertain the thought of winning. Peter proved that his philosophy of playing badminton was very successful. After finding Bushido and practicing it, Peter went on a 6-month winning streak that culminated tournaments such as the Japan Open, the Nordic Championship, the Danish Championship and finally the World Championships.\nUnder Pressure.\nPeter is well known for his actions while responding to pressure. He claims that he does not play to win, he says that Bushido dictates that \"walking the path is enough\", the fact that he was playing badminton humbled him. Various examples of Bushido in work included when Peter, just entering the Danish National Camp, was playing in the Danish National Championships had to face the fourth seeded Peter Janum in the quarters, who was heavily favored to win the tournament. But the resilient Peter Rasmussen came out and beat Janum 15-1, 15-2 in less than 25 minutes.\nAt the European Championships in 2002, Peter had to face country-man Anders Boesen, this was after a four-year lay-off period for Peter who was recovering from foot injury. Boesen ranked 5th in the World at the time, was leading Rasmussen 5-1 in the final set but Rasmssusen seemed to have ignored the pressure completely and came back to win 7-5 and a ticket to face another country-man, Kenneth Jonasson, Rasmussen was outclassed in the first set losing 7-0 to the World #2 ranked player. But with a level of focus rarely seen in sports, Rasmussen fought back to take the match in a grueling 5 sets.\nPeter's most impressive match was probably at the Thomas Cup Finals where Denmark was facing Indonesia for a ticket to play China in the finals. Denmark took the first two Men's Doubles matches, but Peter Gade crumpled under the pressure of Indo first singles player Sony Dwi Kuncoro. Kenneth Jonassen followed suit by losing to future Olympic Gold and World Champion Taufik Hidayat. So the spotlight was again on Peter Rasmussen to step up, and step up he did. He beat the youngster from Indonesia, Simon Santoso in front of 12,000 screaming Indonesian fans in straight sets, 15-3, 15-12.\nPost Retirement.\nPeter, who has devoted much of his life to badminton and gave everything that he had, did not want to stop after retiring from the pro circuit in February 2005. He is now completing his medical studies and is also a manager for the Badminton Players Federation, the union representing the professional badminton players under the banner of the Badminton World Federation (formerly International Badminton Federation, formerly World Badminton Federation).\n2004 Badminton Revolution Cup.\nPrior to his announcing of his retirement, Peter was contacted by Bobby Milroy, the current president of the BPF, to offer Peter the chance to come to Canada, Milroy's country to participate in what was known as the 2004 Revolution Cup. The Revolution Cup was the biggest badminton tournament to go to Canada since the World Championships held in Calgary in 1985. An official DVD of the tournament is also available .\nReturn to Badminton.\nPeter Rasmussen has marked his return to playing badminton at the Danish Club level for Vendsyssel Badminton Club along with Malaysian badminton player Muhammad Roslin Hashim. Peter says that this is probably as far as he will go, that he will not be trying to get back onto the Danish National Team.\nAchievements.\nApart from all the tournament victories Peter has accomplished, he and finalist of the IBF World Championships in 1997, Sun Jun hold the longest game record at 124 minutes.\nWorld Championships.\n\"Men's singles\"\nEuropean Championships.\n\"Men's singles\"\nIBF World Grand Prix.\nThe World Badminton Grand Prix sanctioned by International Badminton Federation (IBF) from 1983 to 2006.\n\"Men's singles\""

It’s hard to make a jumper if you’re floating; the laws of physics dictate that. But Vic went up and tipped it in. Vic and I had played on the same team in high school,” he said. “I told him, ‘We stayed together just for this moment.' ”\nIn his senior year, 1963–1964, Hunter led Loyola to a 22–6 record, averaging 21.4 points and 15.3 rebounds, as the Ramblers made the 1964 NCAA University Division basketball tournament.

        "text": "Ronald Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis (born January 1, 1986) is an American former professional basketball player. He played for the Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Clippers, and the St. John’s Edge.\nAfter playing college basketball with the LSU Tigers, Davis was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 35th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. Shortly thereafter, he was traded to the Boston Celtics, with whom he won the 2008 NBA Finals.\nAmateur career.\nDavis attended Louisiana State University Laboratory School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Davis was listed as the No. 3 power forward and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2004.\nDavis attended Louisiana State University (LSU) and played college basketball for the LSU Tigers. The Southeastern Conference's (SEC) coaches voted Davis the 2006 SEC Player of the Year, and he was also named to the All-SEC first team. In 2006 as a sophomore, Davis led the Tigers to their first Final Four appearance since 1986. In the crucial game of the national semifinals, LSU lost to UCLA, trailing by a wide margin in the first half and never managing a comeback. Davis scored 17 points and made 4 out of 10 free throws before eventually fouling out.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (2007–2011).\nOn March 20, 2007, Davis held a press conference to announce that he would forgo his junior season at LSU and enter his name into the 2007 NBA draft.

With the departures of Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, and Al Jefferson, Davis was expecting to see a lot of playing time his rookie season. Though he is primarily a power forward, Davis also spent some time playing as the team's backup center in the regular season.\nAfter coming off the bench for the first 19 games of the season, Davis made his first NBA start against the Sacramento Kings on December 12, 2007, in place of injured center Kendrick Perkins. Playing at power forward with Kevin Garnett taking Perkins' place at center, he scored 16 points and pulled down 9 rebounds as the Celtics won the game 90–78. His breakout performance took place against the Detroit Pistons on January 5, 2008, as he scored 16 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter, including the last basket of the game. The Celtics would win the 2008 NBA Finals in Davis's rookie season by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in six games in the finals.\nOn March 21, 2009, Davis scored a then-career-high 24 points against the Memphis Grizzlies in the Celtics' 105–87 win in Memphis.\nIn the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Davis had significant playing time after injuries to Kevin Garnett and Leon Powe. In Game Four of the 2009 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic, Davis made two key shots, including a buzzer beater, in the final seconds of the game to give the Celtics the 95–94 win over the Magic. After the shot, Davis accidentally jostled a twelve-year-old fan while running down the court in celebration. The boy's father complained to NBA and Celtics officials but later retracted his demand for an apology. Davis apologized nevertheless, and said that, \"I'm a big guy. Imagine if my emotions are going so wild, and if I'm running by somebody, I don’t feel them. If I've hurt anybody or if I’ve done any harm to anybody, please forgive me because my intentions were harmless.\"\nOn August 10, 2009, Davis signed a two-year, $6.5 million contract with the Celtics. On May 27, 2010, during the 2010 Eastern Conference Finals against the Orlando Magic in Game 5, Glen Davis suffered a severe concussion when he got elbowed in the face by Dwight Howard.

On March 29, 2014, coach Doc Rivers had security escort Davis to the locker room after the two exchanged words when Rivers removed him from the game against the Houston Rockets. On July 19, 2014, Davis re-signed with the Clippers on a one-year deal.\nDavis became an unrestricted free agent following the 2014–15 season and had left ankle surgery in September 2015, sidelining him from basketball-related activities for eight to 12 weeks.\nSt. John's Edge (2018–2019).\nIn September 2018, Davis was announced as a new player for Zadar of the Croatian League and the ABA League, but failed to make a final agreement with the club management, consequently leaving the team before signing a contract.\nOn December 5, 2018, Davis signed with the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada. In the 2018–19 season, Davis averaged 17.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game.

        "title": "Argentina national cricket team",
        "text": "The Argentina national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Argentina in international cricket. The team is organised by the Argentine Cricket Association (ACA), which became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1974.\nWith the sport having been introduced by British immigrants, Argentina played its first international cricket match in 1868, against Uruguay, with fixtures against Brazil and Chile following in 1888 and 1893, respectively. Beginning in 1912, there were regular visits from English teams, including the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on two occasions. On four of those tours, matches between the Argentine national side and the visiting team were accorded first-class status, making for 13 first-class matches in total between 1912 and 1938. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, the mainstays of South American cricket, commenced regular international matches in the 1920s, which have continued into the present-day (outside the period surrounding World War II). The South American Championship was created in 1995 by those three teams and Peru, and is now held annually. Argentina has been the dominant team at the championship, winning ten out of the sixteen tournaments held, and consequently has sent only development sides since 2000 (until 2019 when the matches in the event were eligible for Twenty20 International status for the first time).\nArgentina made its ICC tournament debut at the 1979 ICC Trophy in England, which was the first event staged only for associate members. The team failed to appear at the subsequent 1982 edition, but from 1986 to 2001 appeared in five consecutive tournaments. However, Argentina only won its first match at the 1990 tournament, when it defeated East and Central Africa. The team won four matches in division two at the 2001 edition, but has made no further appearances in what has now been renamed the World Cup Qualifier. In the early 2000s, Argentina was one of the leading associates in the ICC Americas region, and in 2007, when the World Cricket League (WCL) was established, the side was placed into Division Three. Promoted into Division Two later in the year, it was immediately relegated, and continued to drop divisions over the following years. Finally, after placing fourth at the 2013 Division Six event, Argentina lost its place in the global tournament system. The team is yet to re-qualify, instead competing only in regional tournaments.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nCricket has been played in Argentina since 1806, with the international side making its first appearance in 1868 against Uruguay. Argentina faced Uruguay 29 times up until World War II, winning 21 of the matches. The team had previously played against Brazil in 1888 and then against Chile in 1893. For its first match against Chile, the national team had to travel to Santiago by crossing the Andes by mule, which took three and a half days.\nFirst-class cricket.\nArgentina first played first-class cricket in 1912 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. The national team played a three match series against the visitors, winning the first game, but losing the second and third. The teams were made up almost exclusively of British expatriates who were mostly employed on the railways, in export or in farming.\nBetween the wars, infrequent fixtures were played against Brazil and Argentina, and were at that time included in Wisden's cricket records. First-class matches were played against an elderly MCC side in 1926/27, Sir Julien Cahn's XI in 1930 and Sir Theodore Brinckman's XI in 1937/38. The four-match series against the MCC was lost 2–1, with one game drawn. The three-match series against Sir Julien Cahn's XI finished with two draws, Cahn's XI winning the first game and the series against Brinkman's XI was drawn 1–1. That series was Argentina's last involvement in first-class cricket to date.\nPlayers and clubs.\nIn 1932 a South American team consisting mainly of Argentine-based players toured England. It played seven first class matches and twelve other fixtures.\nA two match series against Chile in December 1938 was won by Argentina, the second match of which saw the interesting occurrence of Argentina's Alfred Jackson playing against his brother John Jackson.\nLeading players during this period were the Ayling brothers, K. Bush (who also played for Brazil), D. Cavanagh, Herbert Dorning (the so-called \"Grand Old Man of Argentine Cricket\") and Donald Forrester.\nA strong club scene existed until the 1950s with clubs Belgrano, Buenos Aires, Lomas, and Hurlingham. This resulted in a relatively strong national side. Railway and Bank teams disbanded after the war along with the formerly strong San Isidro side. The national side sank to a low level, being heavily beaten by MCC in 1958–59.\nBy 2010, cricket had made some positive strides in Argentina even if the national side was struggling somewhat.\nOld Georgian, Lomas, Belgrano, Hurlingham, and San Albano were as strong as they had been for some time along with Buenos Aires CRC, which was once again fielding sides after a long absence. Bedes Grammar School and Atlético del Rosario were both working their way through the lower divisions of the domestic league and supplying many players to the national age group squads, while an Academy side had been introduced into the First Division in response to the growing number of young players from the Italian/Spanish majority that were taking up the sport.\nPreviously the club competition had been kept alive largely by Anglo-Argentines – many of whom were descendants of well known cricketing identities in the country going right back to the early 20th century. In all, more than 30 teams at senior level comprised from the eight clubs were competing in four divisions and there was also a quickly growing ladies league.\nICC Trophy.\nArgentina participated in the first ICC Trophy in 1979 but missed the second in 1982 which was played in England and started only two days after the conclusion of Falklands War. They returned for the 1986 ICC Trophy and played in every one following that until the 2001 event. They did not qualify for the 2005 tournament.\nAmericas Championship.\nArgentina hosted and won the first South American Championship in 1995 and still play in the tournament today, though they now send an \"A\" team. They also participated in the first ICC Americas Championship in 2000, finishing 5th. MCC visited again in March 2001, winning both matches.\nArgentina hosted the Americas Championship in 2002, finishing sixth. MCC toured again in 2004, drawing the series 1–1. Later that year, Argentina finished 5th in the Americas Championship.\nIn 2006, the Americas Championship was split into two divisions and Argentina were placed in Division Two. They won the Division Two tournament and were promoted to Division One in Canada that August, where they finished 5th.\nIn 2008 they finished 5th with only one victory coming against newcomers Suriname. The inclusion of coach Hamish Barton in the team proved successfully specially when he scored 99 not out against Canada. Argentina ended being beaten in a nail-biting finish by 1 wicket.\nWorld Cricket League.\nThis originally qualified them for Division Five of the World Cricket League, but they were placed in Division Three following the suspension of the USA from international cricket. They finished as runners-up to Uganda in the tournament and qualified for Division Two in Windhoek, Namibia.\nFollowing their promotion, in November 2007, Argentina traveled to Namibia to take part in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League. They played Denmark, the hosts, Oman and the UAE in addition to the other qualifier from Division Three; Uganda. Division Two proved to be a step too far for Argentina, as they lost all their group matches and then lost to Uganda in a positional playoff and finished sixth. On the basis of their sixth-place finish in this tournament, Argentina were relegated back to Division Three for the 2009 tournament which Argentina hosted from 24 to 31 January 2009. However, Argentina again struggled, losing all five of their games to finish bottom of the table and were relegated to the Division Four. In Division 4 their downfall continued and lost all the games thus relegated to Division Five. Then again in Division 5 they lost all the matches and have now been relegated to Division Six. Argentina have lost considerable form over time and with present ways they may go down the WCL structure.\nIn 2013, Argentina took part in Division Six of the World Cricket League and came fourth. In normal circumstances it meant they will play Div 6 in 2015 but ICC is going for a change of structure of World Cricket League and Argentina might go out of the WCL Structure unless they fight back which looks tough.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Argentina and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nArgentina played their first T20I match against Mexico on 3 October 2019 during the 2019 South American Cricket Championship in Peru\nIn October 2019, Argentina won 2019 South American Cricket Championship after defeating\nMexico by four wickets in the final\nSquad.\nArgentina's squad for the 2023 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Sub-regional Qualifier:\nReserves:\nRecords &amp; Statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Argentina\n\"Last updated 20 October 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Argentina\nMost T20I wickets for Argentina\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2323.

The official league was founded in 2007, yet amateur leagues have existed since the early 1980s. The league collapsed in 2010 due to funding issues as they were unable to maintain the major arenas they played in. The league is now ran by the IIHA with all games played at Dundonald International Ice Bowl due to closure of other rinks.\nHistory.\nFollowing on from the construction of Dundalk Ice Dome and the success of the Division 3 Ice Hockey World Championship held in Dundalk during April 2007 the Irish Ice Hockey Association announced the formation of an all new, all-Ireland Ice Hockey League. The five teams play all of their regular season games at the Dundalk Ice Dome. The league's inaugural champions were the Dundalk Bulls who won the championship by defeating the Dublin Rams 6-3.\nPrior to the Irish Ice Hockey League's formation, the only Ice Hockey team in Ireland playing competitive hockey was the Belfast Giants of the UK's Elite Ice Hockey League. Many Irish hockey players seeking to play the sport at a competitive level have had to travel abroad.\nThe league is now played under the Irish Ice Hockey Association at an amateur level. All games are played at Dundonald International Ice Bowl due to the closure of the Dundalk Ice Dome."

        "text": "Wales Rugby League is the national governing body for rugby league football in Wales.\nIn 1907 The Welsh Northern Rugby Football Union was formed in Wrexham, but the English Northern Rugby Football Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the south of Wales and the Welsh body soon folded.\nIn 1926 the English body, now called the Rugby Football League (RFL) formed a Welsh commission in an attempt to convert rugby union clubs to rugby league. The Wales Rugby League was founded in 1995 and achieved governing body status in 2005 and employed its first professional chairman, Mark Rowley, in 2006. The WRL is responsible for the running of the game in Wales, for organising games and competitions and for selecting the squad for the national teams. In addition to managing professional and amateur national representative senior teams, WRL runs several age grade international sides from under 13s to a student team. The senior teams each play in annual European competitions, and the professional side compete in the World Cup every 4 years.\nIn 2006 the WRL achieved autonomous status from the Rugby Football League. In 2010, at a meeting of the Rugby League International Federation in Melbourne, Australia, the WRL were made full members of the Federation.\nWRL has 14 affiliated clubs, including four university clubs. Wales Rugby League is based at Sports Wales Centre in Cardiff \nThe national team took part in the 2011 Gillette Four Nations tournament against Australia, England and New Zealand.\nThe under 19s contingent, consisting of players from South Wales Scorpions and North Wales Crusaders, won the bronze medal at the inaugural Commonwealth Rugby League Championships, which took place in June 2014 in Glasgow. The gold medal was won by Papua New Guinea, with Australia winning silver.\nFormer France and England head coach, John Kear, took over from Iestyn Harris as national head coach on 16 July 2014, a role he will undertake alongside his coaching role at Championship side Batley. His first games in charge were during the European Championships in Autumn 2014.\nWales qualified for the 2017 World Cup in Australia, through beating Italy away in a playoff for the 2nd European spot. By finishing 2nd in the 2018 European Championship behind France and defeating Ireland 30–8 in Wrexham, they earned automatic qualification for the 2021 World Cup in England. Wales will also field a wheelchair side in the accompanying tournament. In 2019 they took part in the Rugby League World Cup 9s tournament in Australia."

        "title": "All-Ireland League (rugby union)",
        "text": "The All-Ireland League (AIL), known for sponsorship reasons as the Energia All-Ireland League, is the national league system for the 50 senior rugby union clubs in Ireland, covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The league was inaugurated in the 1990–91 season.\nCork Constitution F.C are the only club to have constantly retained their status in Division 1 since 1990/91. All other clubs in the league have experienced relegation.\nThe league is the second highest level of rugby union in Ireland, as professional teams representing the four provinces of Ireland play in the United Rugby Championship.\nDivision 1 sides may field no more than two professional players in their matchday sides, and only one may be a forward. Division 2 sides may not field professional players. Foreign professional players may not play in the League.\nCork Constitution, the inaugural winners, are the only club to have retained top division status since the inception of the league.\nCompetition format.\nThe league is divided into five divisions of ten teams each. Teams play each other team in the division twice per season (once at home and once away), for a total of 18 regular-season matches. \nThe season runs from mid-September until mid-April, with an approximately four-week break in matches from mid-December to early-January. At the end of the season, the top four teams in division 1A enter a play off semi-finals and a final for the championship.\nPromotion and relegation.\nAt the end of each season the bottom team in division 1A is replaced by the top team in division 1B, with the second-bottom team entering a promotion/relegation play-off with the second-placed team in 1B. The bottom two teams in 1B, 2A and 2B are relegated and replaced by the top two teams from divisions 2A, 2B and 2C respectively.\nThe two teams finishing bottom of division 2C are relegated to the relevant provincial league, and replaced by the two teams finishing top of a \"round robin\" tournament between the four provincial league winners. The four provincial junior leagues are the Connacht Junior League, the Leinster League, the Munster Junior League and the Ulster Championship League.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1990, there was no national league in Ireland. Each of the four provincial unions had its own cup and league tournament. In 1991, after almost five years of discussion and consultation with clubs, the All-Ireland League (AIL) was introduced with two divisions, division 1 with 9 clubs and division 2 with 10 clubs. The AIL was expanded to four divisions in 1993–94, with small variations in the numbers of teams per division in subsequent seasons.\nIn 2000–01 the league was restructured to three divisions, each with 16 teams. After the 1995 introduction of professionalism in rugby union, the IRFU increased the importance of the provinces, which from 2002 participated in the Celtic League (now the United Rugby Championship) as full-time teams rather than ad hoc selections of club players. Therefore, the best Irish players no longer played in the AIL. In 2004 the IRFU proposed scrapping the All-Ireland League and reintroducing a provincial league system in 2005–06 which would act as qualifiers for a curtailed three division AIL structure in the second half of the season, but this model did not receive the support of clubs or rugby pundits. In 2007 the IRFU agreed that the structure of the All-Ireland League would remain as three divisions with 16 clubs each for seasons 2008–09 and 2009–10. In 2009–10, division 1 was split into 1A and 1B with eight teams in each as a trial and then continued in season 2010–11. In 2011–12 division 1A and 1B had 10 clubs each and divisions 2 and 3 were reformatted as divisions 2A and 2B with 16 clubs in each division.\nPrevious winners.\n† From season 1990–91 through to 1996–97, the team placing top of Division 1 was crowned AIL League Champion\n‡ From season 1997–98, playoffs were introduced which was contested by the top four teams in Division 1 for the title of AIL League Champion; in the semi-finals the top placed team played the 4th placed team and the 2nd placed team the 3rd placed team\n§ The title in 2013–14 was decided on final league position; there were no play-offs.\nClub statistics.\nThe All-Ireland League has been dominated by teams from Limerick (Shannon, Garryowen, and Young Munster) who have won 13 out of 32 titles. Teams from Munster have won 20 out of 32.\nTeams.\nDivisions for the 2023–24 season.\nSponsorship.\nThe All-Ireland League was not sponsored in the initial season, but was sponsored for six years by Insurance Corporation of Ireland. The League was sponsored by Allied Irish Banks from 1998 to 2010, Ulster Bank from 2010 to 2019, 2018/19 season was not sponsored and Energia since the 2019–20 season."

        "text": "Virtua Tennis 3, known in Japan as Sega Professional Tennis: Power Smash 3, is the second arcade game sequel to Sega's tennis game franchise, \"Virtua Tennis\". The arcade version of \"Virtua Tennis 3\" is powered by the PC-based Sega Lindbergh arcade system board. Ports for the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles are also available with a traditional collection of tennis minigames that the home versions of \"Virtua Tennis\" are known for. In 2009, Sega updated and re-created \"Virtua Tennis 3\" in \"Virtua Tennis 2009\".\nConsole versions.\nBesides having Tournament Mode and Exhibition Mode from the arcade version, the home versions include a World Tour Mode and Court Games mode. These game modes replace the Challenge Mode that was present in the arcade version.\nThe Xbox 360 version has exclusive Xbox Live online tournaments and modes, whilst the PlayStation 3 version incorporates the option to control the game using the Sixaxis motion-sensitive controller.\nBoth the 360 and PS3 versions offer native 1080p support.\nGame modes.\nWorld Tour.\nThis is the main mode of the game. In this mode, the user creates a tennis player (male or female), and enters the SPT World Tour with a ranking position of 300th, and with the goal of becoming the number 1. The player needs to improve his ranking by winning matches and tournaments, as well as his abilities by successfully completing training minigames and academy exercises. This mode also allows the player to interact with the featured professional tennis players.\nTournament.\nThis mode is similar to the arcade version of the game. The user can select either a featured professional player or one of his created players (from the World Tour mode), and must win 5 matches in different surfaces and venues to win the tournament. If the player performs well enough and gets a very good rank (A), he is challenged by Duke, one of the game's bosses. However, if the player performs well in the tournament but achieves a mediocre rank (D), he is challenged by King instead.\nExhibition.\nThis mode allows the user to play single matches with customized options, such as the player, the opponent and the court.\nCourt Games.\nThis mode features the minigames from the World Tour mode and is dedicated to multiplayer gaming.\nReception.\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of 28 out of 40.\n\"GamePro\" gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions each a score of 4.25 out of 5, with The Watcher calling the former \"an outstandingly well-made game. Its technically impressive visuals, easy to learn but hard to master gameplay, and great selection of mini-games makes \"Virtua Tennis 3\" an ace\"; and Ouroboros later saying of the latter, \"Bloated expectations aside, \"Virtua Tennis\" is a fan service treat from the moment you open the box, and setting down the controller without blowing hours on end requires considerable willpower, even if it all comes to feel like just a more refined, balanced version of what we already played to death on the Dreamcast.\" \"Edge\" gave the PS3 version a score of eight out of ten, saying, \"This new outing for Sega's ever-appealing sports series is a deeper, more serious and demanding beast than before, yet happily manages to retain the series’ lighthearted atmosphere and is, on occasion, utterly bonkers.\" \"Retro Gamer\" gave the PSP version a score of 80%, saying, \"Admittedly, it's still a great game, but when you consider that \"\" can now be purchased for just under a tenner (and an absolute bargain it is too), it's very hard to justify shelling out extra money for a near identical experience.\"\nGabe Boker of \"GameZone\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 8.2 out of 10, saying, \"It provides solid online multiplayer, a career mode bursting with life, and addictive mini-games fans have come to expect.\" Ronnie Hobbs gave the PS3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it \"A fast, frantic, and high-octane style of tennis. If this sounds like fun then you will feel right at home. Anyone looking for a more realistic approach will want to find another source.\" Louis Bedigian gave the PSP version eight out of ten, calling it \"a content-filled, mini-game-infused joyride that anyone can love.\""

        "text": "John Francis Morrill (February 19, 1855 – April 2, 1932), nicknamed \"Honest John\", was an American first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball who played from 1876 to 1890 for the Boston Red Caps/Beaneaters, Washington Nationals, and Boston Reds. Over the years he played all positions. Although he pitched a couple of games each season, he was primarily an infielder, and had a career batting average of .260.\nEarly life.\nMorrill's parents were Irish emigrants to Boston, where Morrill was born. He played for amateur teams including the Boston Stars and the Lowell Lowells prior to being signed by the Boston Red Legs in 1876.\nCareer.\nMorrill stood 5'11\" and weighed 155 pounds as he began his major league career, and he had been known as a second baseman and catcher. Once he arrived in the major leagues, Morrill only played 23 games at catcher, all of them in his first season with Boston. An obituary stated that he was one of the last catchers to appear at the position without a glove.\nIn an incredible season in 1883, he batted .316, played six different positions, and led the Boston Beaneaters to the National League pennant after taking over as manager from Jack Burdock in midseason.\nPopular baseball manager King Kelly described Morrill as a careful manager who saved Boston a great deal of money through his decisions. Kelly cited Morrill's understanding of the rules when he said that Morrill was a better manager than anyone besides Cap Anson. Kelly dismissed the popular notion that he did not get along with Morrill.\nLater life.\nMorrill raised five children. After his retirement as a player, Morrill worked for a Boston sporting goods company, where he was manager and treasurer. He died at the age of 77 in Brookline, Massachusetts, and he was interred at the Holyhood Cemetery. The cause of death was pneumonia."

ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.\nHistory.\nThe station opened in 1960 as \"Golf Street Halt\" before changing its name on 16 May 1983.\nLocation.\nThe station is the nearest to the Carnoustie Golf Links. During the 1999 Open Championship, extra services were laid on to bring spectators to the course, significantly boosting passenger figures for that year.\nFacilities.\nFacilities are incredibly low at Golf Street, consisting of just two benches (one on each platform) and a shelter on platform 2.

        "text": "Jerry Ralph Williams (November 1, 1923 – December 31, 1998) was an American football player and coach who served as the head coach of two Canadian Football League (CFL) teams, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL).\nEarly life.\nWilliams was a native of Spokane, Washington. He attended North Central High School where he was an all-city running back and All-Inland Empire Athlete of the Year (1942) as a three-sport athlete. Graduating in 1942, Williams enrolled at the University of Idaho, but with the war efforts building he made the decision to join his older brother, William H. Williams (eventual Chief Justice of the Washington State Supreme Court) in the United States Army Air Corps. Williams became a fighter pilot flying P-38s in the Pacific theater. One of his most notable missions was as a fighter escort to both Japanese and American dignitaries traveling to Tokyo Bay and the peace signing on the in 1945. Returning from the war efforts, Williams enrolled at Washington State University, where he played both offense and defensive halfback for the Cougars from 1946 to 1948. He set the Pacific Coast Conference kickoff return record and led the Cougars in total offense in his senior season at WSU. Most notable was a punt return of 97 yards against Oregon in 1947 and kickoff returns of 88 and 87 yards against Montana and California. In Williams' senior season (1948) he earned All-Coast honors accumulating 1,500 all-purpose yards. He participated in both the East–West Shrine Game and College All-Star Classic before joining the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL).\nProfessional career.\nPlaying career.\nDrafted in the seventh round of the 1949 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, Williams played four seasons with the team, seeing most of his action as a defensive back. During his first three seasons the Rams made three consecutive trips to the NFL title game winning the 1951 NFL Championship.\nIn his first season Williams intercepted five passes. The most memorable image of his Rams career however came in the 1951 regular season finale against the Green Bay Packers on December 16. Following a missed Packer field goal Williams returned the attempt 99 yards for a touchdown, a record that stood until the 1971 season when Williams coached, Al Nelson had a 102-yard missed field goal return, when rule changes allowed for missed field goal attempts into the end zone to be returned.\nWilliams' desire to play on the offensive side of the ball led to his request to be traded and on May 12, 1953, Williams was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles. He proceeded to lead the Eagles in total offense during his first season and in his two years caught 75 passes, rushed for over 500 yards and scored eight touchdowns. Williams served in the capacity of player-coach in 1954 before leaving the playing field for the coaching ranks.\nCoaching career.\nOfficially entering the coaching ranks the following year Williams became the head coach at the University of Montana where in three seasons his teams, while known for their competitiveness went 6–21 overall. Football wasn't the only endeavor that led to close calls for Williams as he escaped with his life on two separate occasions during harrowing crash landings of small aircraft. While piloting a private plane on May 24, 1956, Williams and assistant Lauri Niemi were knocked unconscious in a crash near the Idaho/Montana border when they were forced, through bad weather, to attempt a landing on a rural mountain road. And again on October 3, 1957, Williams with 14 of his players, while en route to Provo, Utah to face the Brigham Young Cougars, were forced down for yet another emergency landing.\nAfter the 1957 season Williams returned to Philadelphia to serve as the Philadelphia Eagles defensive back coach under head coach Buck Shaw with the team capturing the 1960 NFL Championship in a thrilling 17–13 victory over Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers. It was also during this season that Williams came up with one of his most notable contributions to the game, devising the \"nickel\" defensive scheme, a scheme still employed by most football programs today. Shaw retired after the 1960 season but new coach Nick Skorich kept Williams on his staff until their dismissal at the conclusion of the 1963 season. \nNew ownership and the arrival of a new coach and general manager in Joe Kuharich led to Williams accepting an assistant coaching position with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Williams earned a law degree from Temple University while he was with the Eagles, before moving to Calgary as an assistant in 1953. Shortly after the conclusion of the 1964 season Williams was elevated to head coach and compiled a 40–23–1 record over the next four years. He earned CFL Coach of the Year honors in 1967. His teams reached the playoffs three times and competed in the 1968 Grey Cup (the first time in 19 years)\nOn May 9, 1969, after another ownership change in Philadelphia, Williams was hired as the Eagles new head coach. While building a competitive team with minimal talent Williams endured but a 7–22–2 record during his first two seasons. After promises by owner Leonard Tose to honor William's 3-year contract Tose released Williams after just the first three games of the '71 pre-season. Tose was the recipient of Williams' parting disdain calling the owner \"a man without courage or character\", words that would likely cost Williams a second head coaching opportunity in the NFL. Williams was replaced by Ed Khayat, and finished the 1971 season as an assistant with the Cleveland Browns. \nOn January 19, 1972, Williams returned to the CFL when he was named head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In just his first season the Ti-Cats reached the pinnacle of Canadian professional football, winning the Grey Cup in a 13–10 thriller over the Western Conference champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. Williams resigned after four seasons with the Tiger-Cats on December 12, 1975, following a 5–10–1 season. In his four years with Hamilton, Williams compiled a 30–29–1 record and a Grey Cup title.\nAfter briefly turning to ranching in Arizona, Williams made one last foray into football, returning as offensive coordinator with the Calgary Stampeders. He was later promoted to head coach on October 5, 1981, upon the firing of Ardell Wiegandt but once again retired from coaching football after that season, finishing out the 1981 season with a 1–3 record (the Stampeders finished 6–10 overall). He returned to Arizona to become part owner in a flight charter service and enjoy retirement in Prescott and later, Chandler.\nDeath.\nIn 1990 Jerry was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia and spent two months in the hospital eventually making a full recovery. By 1998 however his health began to fail and on December 31 he died in Chandler, Arizona with his wife, middle son and youngest daughter by his side."

        "title": "Bill Hewitt (American football)",
        "text": "William Ernest Hewitt (October 8, 1909 – January 14, 1947) was an American football defensive end and end who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played five seasons for the Chicago Bears (1932–1936), three for the Philadelphia Eagles (1937–1939), and one for the Phil-Pitt Steagles (1943). He is remembered for his refusal to wear a helmet as one of the last NFL players not to wear one.\nHewitt played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, where he was named team's most valuable player and second-team All-Big Ten his senior season. In nine NFL seasons, he was named an All-Pro six times, won two NFL championships, and in 1934 led the league in touchdown receptions. His jersey number 56 is retired by the Bears and he is a member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame. Hewitt was posthumously inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nEarly life and college.\nHewitt was born in Bay City, Michigan, and attended Bay City Central High School. He attended the University of Michigan, where he lettered for three seasons for the Michigan Wolverines football team. He started in two games each in 1929 and 1930, and in 1931 was a first-team All-Big Ten selection from the United Press, as well as the Wolverines' team MVP. That season, he started four games at left end and five games at fullback, and had 446 yards rushing on 118 attempts. Against Minnesota, he scored the only touchdown of the game on a 57-yard run to help Michigan secure that year's Little Brown Jug trophy with a 6–0 win.\nProfessional career.\nHis head coach in Chicago, George Halas, called Hewitt \"absolutely fearless. He was a happy-go-lucky guy—until he stepped onto the field—and then he was a terror on offense or defense. He asked no quarter nor gave any.\" For most of his career, Hewitt refused to wear a helmet during games, reasoning that wearing one inhibited his play. He played without one until 1939, his final season with the Eagles, due to new league rules requiring players to wear a helmet. On defense, Hewitt was known for his quick reaction to the snap, which led fans to refer to him as \"The Offside Kid.\" \"I just anticipate when the ball is going to be snapped and charge at the same time\", explained Hewitt. \"Anyway, what is the head linesman for? It's up to him to call offside if he thinks I am.\"\nChicago Bears.\nHewitt played for the Chicago Bears for five seasons, from 1932 to 1936. As a rookie, he played in the 1932 NFL Playoff Game for the Bears against the Portsmouth Spartans, which was held to break a tie that season for the NFL championship. The Bears defeated the Spartans 9–0. \nThe next season the Bears played in the first ever NFL Championship Game, against the New York Giants, a game started by Hewitt at left end. Hewitt had only one reception for three yards in the game, but was a part of what was described as \"the greatest play of the game.\" In the fourth quarter, with the Bears trailing by five, Hewitt received a pass from Bears quarterback Keith Molesworth, before lateraling to end Bill Karr, who then ran 19 yards for the final touchdown of the game. The Bears won the game 23–21.\nHewitt led the league in receiving touchdowns in 1934, with five, and was named a first-team All-NFL selection for the third time in as many years. In 1935 Hewitt caught five passes and was without a touchdown for the first time in his career. He had his most productive season as a pro in both receiving yards and touchdowns in 1936, as he caught 15 passes for 358 yards and six touchdowns.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nAfter considering retirement, Hewitt was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles with $4,000 in cash from the Bears in exchange for the rights to the first overall selection in the 1937 NFL draft, Sam Francis, on February 15, 1937. Hewitt's game salary increased from $100 per game to $200 per game following the trade. He played for the Eagles for three seasons from 1937 to 1939. He was named to the All-NFL team in 1937, becoming the first player in league history to be named an All-Pro for two different teams. He had his second All-NFL selection as an Eagle in 1938 after catching a career-high 18 passes on the season. In November 1939, Eagles president Bert Bell announced Hewitt would be retiring at the end of the season after eight years in the NFL. In his final home game with the Eagles, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he was the middle man of a 66-yard play as he received a 26-yard pass from Davey O'Brien and lateraled to Jay Arnold, who ran 40 yards for the touchdown. They won 17–14—their first and only win that season.\nSteagles and retirement.\nAfter being out of football for three seasons, Hewitt returned in 1943 to play fullback for the Steagles, a temporary merger of the Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers during World War II. He appeared in six games that season, started in four of them, and caught two passes for 22 yards, after which he retired for good. During his career he caught 103 passes for 1,638 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also had one rushing touchdown and three passing touchdowns. He was named an All-Pro by at least one major U.S. publication six times in his career.\nAfter football.\nAfter retiring from professional football in 1943, Hewitt worked for Supplee-Wills-Jones, a milk company, until September 1946. He died in a car crash on January 14, 1947, in Sellersville, Pennsylvania and was interred at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.\nHewitt was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. With his induction, the Bears became the first NFL team to have a complete one-platoon lineup in the Hall of Fame. In 2008 Hewitt was named to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He is a member of the National Football League 1930s All-Decade Team, selected in 1969 by the Hall of Fame. Hewitt's jersey number 56 is retired by the Bears, and he is enshrined in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Wang Yeu-tzuoo (), who also goes by Jimmy Wang, (born February 8, 1985) is a former professional tennis player from Taiwan. Until the emergence of Lu Yen-hsun, Wang was the highest ranked player from Taiwan. The right-hander stands 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 141 pounds. Wang's trademark look is his wearing a white baseball cap backwards.\nTennis career.\nJuniors.\nWang started playing tennis at age seven and quickly emerged as one of Asia's most highly touted junior players. He made the final of the 2001 Australian Open Boys' Singles (losing to Janko Tipsarević) and the final of the US Open Boys' Singles (losing to Gilles Müller).\nAs a junior, he compiled a 136–52 win–loss record in singles (and 78–57 in doubles), reaching as high as No. 3 in the world junior singles rankings in April 2001 (and No. 8 in doubles).\nJunior Slam results – Singles:\nAustralian Open: F (2001)\nFrench Open: 1R (2000, 2001)\nWimbledon: SF (2001)\nUS Open: F (2001)\nPro tour.\nWang turned pro in 2003 and has improved his game and ranking year each he has been on the professional circuit. In 2005, Wang broke into the ATP Top 100 for the first time by virtue of three straight Challenger final appearances, winning a title at Istanbul, Turkey. The 21-year-old also reached the quarterfinal round of the ATP event in Bangkok, Thailand, and lost to Rafael Nadal in the 1st round in Beijing, China at the China Open. Wang made his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon in 2004, losing to Andy Roddick in the first round. In 2006, he reached the second round, bowing out to James Blake 3 sets to 1.\nWang's best Grand Slam performance to date came at Wimbledon in 2014, where he defeated Alejandro González and Mikhail Youzhny to advance to the third round, ultimately losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\nHe was a member of the Chinese Taipei Davis Cup team, compiling a 17–6 record in Davis Cup action since 2001.\nNear the end of his career, Wang took breaks from competing due to a persistent wrist injury. With several years of recovery, he decided to play in doubles while helping out the young players. He was content with the results during 2019 and briefly considered making a comeback for some time. However, Wang got tired of traveling around the world to train and compete, which made him start thinking about retirement from professional tennis. His decision was strengthened after getting married and the birth of his child, and Wang eventually started focusing on other things. In September 2019, he played his last match at the 2019 OEC Kaohsiung in doubles with Hsu Yu-hsiou."

        "text": "The men's 200 metre freestyle was a sprint swimming event in the Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics program in Paris. It was the shortest of the three freestyle events. It was held on 11 August and 12 August 1900. 26 swimmers from 10 nations competed. The event was won by Frederick Lane of Australia, with Zoltán Halmay of Hungary earning silver and Karl Ruberl of Austria earning bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nThe two favourites for this race were Frederick Lane of Australia (who had won the British championships in the 220 yards in 1899, along with various other sprint titles in Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand) and Rob Derbyshire of Great Britain (the British champion in 1898). The two men tied for the British title in 1900. But Derbyshire came down with a stomach virus and did not compete at the 1900 Games. Without him, Lane was heavily favoured. Zoltán Halmay of Hungary was likely the nearest contender.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round format, with semifinals and a final. The entrants were divided into five semifinals; each semifinal had approximately 12 swimmers entered, though withdrawals left each with between 4 and 6 swimmers. The fastest swimmer in each semifinal advanced to the final along with the next five fastest times overall. This resulted in a 10-swimmer final.\nThe races were swum downstream in the Seine. This swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events).\nRecords.\nThere were no recognized records in the 200 metre freestyle before this competition. World records would not be recognized until 1902. Otto Wahle had the best time in the first semifinal at 2:35.6, setting the initial Olympic record. Karl Ruberl's fifth semifinal time was 2:22.6, which would stand as the record after these Games when the final times were all slower.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nIn the first round, there were five semifinals. The winner of each semifinal advanced to the final, as did the five fastest losers from across all the semifinals. The semifinals were held on 11 August.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 12 August. Wahle did not start in the final. Lane won easily, more than six seconds ahead of Halmay and Ruberl."

        "text": "Charles Thomas Scott, also known as Shaheed Abdul-Aleem, (born December 15, 1948) is an American former professional basketball player. He played two seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and eight seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Scott was an Olympic Gold Medalist and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018. Scott is the leader in most points per game with 24.8 in Suns franchise history.\nEarly life.\nScott was born in New York City and grew up primarily in Harlem, New York. There, his father was a cab driver.\nA 6'5\" (1.96 m) guard/forward, Scott attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City for one year before transferring to Laurinburg Institute in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Scott transferred to Laurinburg which was famous at the time for preparing basketball players for college. Scott said, \"It had a well-known basketball program. I knew my family wouldn't be able to afford college, so a scholarship was going to be my ticket.\" Scott was valedictorian of his high school senior class. He was also a legend at Rucker Park.\nWhile in high school, Scott spent one summer at a basketball program at Davidson College with coach Lefty Driesell. Driesell recruited Scott who was accepted for early admission at Davidson. However, Scott also explored Duke University, North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Wake Forest University at the suggestion of his coach at Laurinburg. He ultimately accepted the offer to play at UNC because he felt that, as a larger public university, it would be more open to a black player \"breaking the color barrier\".\nCollege career.\nScott played college basketball at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) where he was the first black scholarship athlete. Scott averaged 22.1 points and 7.1 rebounds per game at UNC, and a career-best 27.1 points per game in his senior season. He was a two-time All-American and a three-time all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection. Scott led UNC to their second and third consecutive NCAA Final Four appearances in 1968 and 1969.\nWoody Durham, a long-time radio announcer for UNC basketball said, \"He really was something. He was the first Carolina player that really would compare to today's player. His build, his speed, his ability—you could take him out of the late 1960s and drop him into today's game, and he wouldn't miss a beat.\"\nIn addition to breaking the color barrier in UNC basketball, he was also the first African-American to pledge a fraternity at UNC, accepting an offer to join St. Anthony Hall, in 1967. However, after three weeks after pledging, withdrew from the fraternity because of his demanding basketball schedule.\nScott was a gold medalist at the 1968 Summer Olympics playing for the 1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team. Scott was the fourth leading scorer on the team (8.0) coached by Henry Iba.\nProfessional career.\nScott was drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1970 but he had already signed a contract with the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Scott was named ABA Rookie of the Year after averaging 27.1 points per game. During his second season with the Squires, he set the ABA record for the highest scoring average in one season (34.6 points per game). However, he became dissatisfied with life in the ABA and joined the NBA's Phoenix Suns in 1972. The Suns traded Paul Silas to the Celtics after the season in order to keep him. At that point, he briefly went by the name Shaheed Abdul-Aleem.\nScott continued his stellar play in the NBA, representing the Suns in three straight NBA All-Star Games (1973, 1974, and 1975), then was traded to the Boston Celtics for Paul Westphal and two draft picks. With the Celtics in the 1975-76 NBA season, Scott won a championship ring against the Suns. Scott later played for the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets. He retired in 1980 with 14,837 combined ABA/NBA career points.\nHe was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\nPersonal life.\nScott was childhood friends with actor Demond Wilson of \"Sanford &amp; Son\" fame.\nWhile attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Scott married Margaret Holmes. They had a daughter, Holly Scott Emanuel.\nScott and his current wife, Trudy, have three children—sons Shaun Scott and Shannon Dean Scott and daughter Simone Scott—and have lived primarily in Atlanta and Los Angeles. They currently live in Columbus, Ohio, where son Shannon used to play for the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Scott served as a marketing director for the sports apparel company Champion for several years, then as executive vice president of CTS, a telemarketing firm, before owning his own business."

        "text": "The men's 4000 metre freestyle was an event on the Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics schedule in Paris. It was the longest of the three freestyle events. It was held on 15 August and 19 August 1900. 29 swimmers from 7 nations competed. The event was won by John Arthur Jarvis of Great Britain, completing a double with the 1000 metre freestyle. Zoltán Halmay of Hungary took silver, with Louis Martin of France earning bronze.\nJarvis swam using the front crawl; Halmay used the Trudgen stroke.\nBackground.\nThe 4000 metre freestyle event was held only once, and was the longest Olympic swimming event until the 10 kilometre open water event was introduced in 2008.\nJohn Arthur Jarvis was the dominant long distance swimmer of the time and a heavy favourite in this event. He was in the midst of a run of British titles in the 880 yard (1898-1901), mile (1897-1902) and long-distance (1898-1904).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round format, with semifinals and a final. The entrants were divided into three semifinals; each semifinal had between 9 and 11 swimmers. The fastest swimmer in each semifinal advanced to the final along with the next six fastest times overall. This resulted in a 9-swimmer final.\nThe races were swum downstream in the Seine.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nIn the first round, there were three semifinals.

The event was won by Ernst Hoppenberg of Germany, with Karl Ruberl of Austria second and Johannes Drost of the Netherlands third.\nBackground.\nThis was the first appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nBefore the Games, Great Britain's Robert Crawshaw was described in \"The New York Herald Tribune\" as the \"champion breast and back swimmer of the world\".\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round format, with semifinals and a final. The entrants were divided into three semifinals; each semifinal had approximately 12 swimmers entered, though withdrawals left each with between 3 and 7 swimmers. The fastest swimmer in each semifinal advanced to the final along with the next seven fastest times overall.

The event was won by the German Swimming Federation, defeating three French teams.

The competition was supposed to include five teams, but the team from Great Britain arrived after the start of the competition.\nCompetition format.\nThere were four heats, with five swimmers in each heat.\nScoring used a fairly strange system: swimmers were seeded into the final heats through an initial ranking round, then received a number of points depending on what place they received in which heat. The five swimmers in the first heat were given between 1 and 5 points, with the winner receiving 1 and points increasing with place. The swimmers in the second heat received between 6 and 10 points, and so on.\nThe scores of the five swimmers on a team were summed, and the team with the fewest points won. This gave a strong advantage to the German team, which had three swimmers in the first heat, and an equally strong disadvantage to the Parisian team, with three swimmers in the fourth heat.\nIf points are given by best time regardless of heat, the Pupilles de Neptune and the Tritons switch places, though the Germans still win and the Parisian team still takes fourth.\nEach race was 200 metres long. This swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events).\nResults.\nRound 1.\nEach team had one swimmer in each of the five first-round heats.

        "text": "Lawrence Lee Brooks Sr. (born June 10, 1950) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). Brooks played college football for the Virginia State Trojans and was selected in the 14th round of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Rams . He was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.\nHigh school.\nVirginia Sport Hall of Fame 2000 inductee, Larry Brooks, a native of Prince George and a Prince George High School standout, made a name for himself at every level of athletics. In high school, he was selected as an All-Central District choice as a defensive end.\nCollege career.\nBrooks furthered his education and attended Virginia State University, where he was named to the Associated Press Little All-American team as a defensive tackle in 1971. He also was named Virginia Small College Lineman of the Year and received All-conference honors.\nProfessional career.\nBrooks became a starter at right defensive tackle in the 8th game of the season during his rookie year of 1972.\nHe collected 9 quarterback sacks in 1973 and the Rams defense was tops in the NFL against the run (allowed 1270 rushing yards) and led the NFL in total defense (allowing just 2970 yards). Larry led Ram defensive linemen in tackles for the first time with 76. The 1973 Los Angeles Rams did not allow 300 yards in all 14 games in a 14-game season. in 2008 the Steelers' defense has held opponents to under 300 yards in all 14 games this season, tied for the longest streak to start a season since 1970. However, the Steelers did not break the Rams' record.\nIn 1974 Brooks tackled opposing passers 11 times as the Rams were first in the NFC with 44 sacks and again led the NFL in allowing the fewest rushing yards with 1302 while allowing the fewest points, 181. That season Brooks was All-NFC as selected by Pro Football Weekly, and Second-team All-Pro by Newspaper Enterprise Association. For the second season in a row, Brooks led all Ram defensive linemen in tackles with 73, not including his 11 sacks, which trailed only Jack Youngblood and Fred Dryer, the team leaders.\nHe recorded 5 sacks in 1975 before a knee injury shelved him for the second half of the season. The Rams clearly missed him during the NFC Championship loss to Dallas as they were suckered countless times by the Cowboys shotgun in a 37-7 loss. The Rams defense was 2nd in the NFL in rushing defense missing out on leading the NFL for the third consecutive year by a single yard. The Minnesota Vikings allowed 1532 rushing yards, while the Rams allowed 1533, allowing the Vikings to capture that title. Nonetheless, the Rams allowed the fewest points in the NFL for the second straight season with 135 (missing the NFL record by 3 points).\nBrooks rebounded in 1976 was named to the Pro Bowl and was voted Second-team All-NFC by United Press International. His 74 tackles again led Ram defensive linemen, with 13 of those going for a loss, to go along with his 14½ sacks which tied him for the team lead with Jack Youngblood. The Rams led the NFC in rushing defense for the third time in the past four years. They were second only the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL in that category.\nIn 1977 was named First-team All-Pro by the Pro Football Writers Association and The Sporting News and First-team All-NFC teams among several others. Rams allowed 146 points, 2nd best in the NFL. Brooks' 6½ sacks were 3rd on the team behind Jack Youngblood and Fred Dryer. His 71 tackles (55 solo) led all Rams defensive linemen (again) and returned to the Pro Bowl (again). Was voted the Rams Outstanding Defensive Lineman by the Los Angeles Rams Alumni.\nIn 1978 Brooks was named Second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press and [Newspaper Enterprise Association and First-team All-NFC by United Press International and Pro Football Weekly despite missing the last 2 games of the season plus the NFC championship game with a knee injury. Led Rams in sacks with 8 as Rams were second in the NFC in sacks and led the NFL in total defense for the second time in the last six years. Brooks again led Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 80 (60 of them solo). Was voted to his third Pro Bowl, but missed the game as teammate Cody Jones (who was the first alternate) replaced him.\nIn 1979, he led the Rams defensive line in tackles with 99 (9 behind the line of scrimmage) and had 6 sacks and knocked down 4 passes as Rams defense led the NFC in sacks with 52. Was named First-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. Ended season by playing in Super Bowl XIV with a torn up ankle as Rams lost to the world champion Pittsburgh Steelers. He also received another post season honor, that of Second-team All-NFC by United Press International.\nIn 1980 Brooks led the defensive line in tackles with 54. His tackle number was lower than previous years as Rams began a rotation system at tackle with Brooks, Cody Jones (33 tackles-4 sacks), and Mike Fanning (37 tackles-10 sacks), who were all healthy for the first time since 1978. The 1980 season was the first since 1969 that three Ram defensive tackles amassed more than 30 tackles each. In addition to having 8½ sacks (as the Rams defense led the NFC with 56 sacks) Brooks was named to his fifth straight Pro Bowl was Second-team All-NFC by United Press International. That marked the sixth season in seven that Brooks attained post-season honors, in being either All-Pro, All-NFC, or a Pro Bowl selection. It also marked the seventh season in the last eight that Brooks led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles.\nThe 1981 season was marred by injury as Brooks injured a knee at mid-season. The knee seemingly never fully recovered and Brooks played only two games at the end of the 1982 season.\nCoaching career.\nBrooks retired after the 1982 season and from 1983-1990 was assistant defensive line coach for the Rams. He spent eight years with the team, where he was paired with defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur. He served as the defensive line coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1994–1998, the Seattle Seahawks from 1999-2002 both under Mike Holmgren, Then to the Chicago Bears in 2003, and was the Detroit Lions defensive line coach from 2004-05. He spent the 2006 season as the defensive line coach for the Arizona Cardinals marking his 21st season as an NFL assistant coach and 33rd season in the NFL as either a player or coach.\nIn 1991 after his 20 years with the Rams (12 as a player, 8 as coach), Brooks returned to his alma mater, where he served as Virginia States’ Assistant Athletic Director and assistant football coach. He was ultimately named Athletic Director in 1993 before his return to the NFL in 1994.\nIn 1998, he led the Packers to become the NFL’s fourth-ranked defensive unit that held its opponents to 281.7 yards a game, and a rushing defense that allowed just 90.1 rushing yards a game. He worked with former all-time sack leader Reggie White (198) and accepted the opportunity to groom one of the NFL’s top sack masters, Michael Sinclair. His line played a major role in Green Bay’s Super Bowl XXXI victory when the defense allowed a league low 259.8 yards per game and a meager 3.5-yard per rush average.\nAs of 2008, Brooks currently serves as the defensive line coach at his alma mater Virginia State University."

The sport has been dominated by teams from East Asia and North America, namely South Korea, China , Canada and the United States . Those four countries have won 147 of 195 medals awarded since 1992. South Korea leads the medal tally, with 53 medals including 26 golds since 1992. The majority of medals that South Korea and China have won at the Winter Olympics come from short-track speed skating.\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics, Haralds Silovs of Latvia became the first athlete in Olympic history to participate in both short track (1500m) and long track (5000m) speed skating, and the first to compete in two disciplines on the same day. After winning the 500m event at the 2014 Winter Olympics, Viktor Ahn became the first short track speedskater to have won gold medals in all four short track disciplines (500m, 1000m, 1500m, 5000m-relay). He had won 3 golds in 2014 representing Russia, and 3 in 2006 representing South Korea.\nIn July 2018, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially added the mixed relay held over a distance of 2000 metres, increasing the total number of events to nine.

        "text": "The Celtic Challenge Rowing Race is a 96-mile (150 km) rowing race from Arklow in Ireland to Aberystwyth in Wales. It is a biennial event which usually takes place on the first Saturday in May. Crews from Wales, Ireland, England and as far afield as Germany compete. \nDescription.\nThe race is open to all 4-oared boats with a cox. No sliding seats or out-riggers are accepted. Normal class entries are Celtic Longboat, Pembrokeshire longboat, Irish East Coast skiff, Irish All Ireland class boat and a variety of Thames skiffs. Each crew consists of 12 people, therefore crew changeover strategies are a must. There is a Senior Men's category along with Senior Ladies, Veteran, Mixed and Miscellaneous categories.\nHistory.\nIn 1989 a crew from Aberystwyth Lifeboat rowed from Arklow to Aberystwyth to raise money for the Bronglais Hospital Scanner Appeal, raising a sum of approximately £4000, taking well over 22 hours to complete the course. In 1991 the Lifeboat crew did another sponsored row from Arklow to Aberystwyth raising money towards the new Lifeboat Station at Aberystwyth. It was from these two sponsored crossings from Arklow that the idea for Celtic Challenge was conceived. In 1993 the first Celtic Challenge Rowing race took place starting from Arklow and ending in Aberystwyth and since then the challenge has taken place in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2006 and 2008. The 2001 event was cancelled due to foot and mouth and in 2002 14 crews took part. The 2004 challenge was cancelled due to bad weather. 2006 had 17 entries.\nA documentary of the 2008 Celtic Challenge, called 'Crossing the Irish' was completed by Rob Garwood in 2009."

        "title": "Jack Thompson (American football)",
        "text": "Jack Thompson (born May 18, 1956), nicknamed \"the Throwin' Samoan\", is an American Samoan former professional American football quarterback. Thompson played in the National Football League (NFL) for six seasons, four with the Cincinnati Bengals and two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played college football for the Washington State Cougars. He was selected in by the Bengals in the first round of the 1979 NFL draft with the third overall pick.\nHis nickname was bestowed on him by \"Spokesman-Review\" columnist Harry Missildine during Thompson's breakout sophomore season at Washington State in 1976.\nCollege career.\nAs a collegian at Washington State University in Pullman, Thompson set numerous school, Pac-10 and NCAA records. In the second game of 1976, he took over on offense after senior starter John Hopkins was injured making a tackle in the second quarter at Minnesota. In a 2002 story, Thompson explained why he chose to attend Washington State and how his first series against Minnesota in 1976 was almost his last until offensive coordinator Bob Leahy convinced head coach Jackie Sherrill to leave Thompson in the game.\nAs a fifth-year senior in 1978, Thompson finished ninth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy, and concluded his college career as the most prolific passer in NCAA history with 7,818 passing yards. Thompson set Pac-10 records for attempts, completions, and TD passes. He was all-conference three times and either first-team, second-team, or honorable mention All-American three times. \nThompson is one of only two players in school history to have his number retired (with Pro Football Hall of Famer Mel Hein); he wore No. 14 and graduated from Evergreen High School in White Center, Washington, in 1974, south of Seattle.\nNFL career.\nThompson was the first quarterback selected in the 1979 NFL draft, taken third overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. At the time, the team had 30-year old Ken Anderson as their starter, who had just finished his seventh season as the starter for a team that went 4–8. Team president and founder Paul Brown felt the need to draft a successor to Anderson to help the team despite projections that saw the New York Giants pick him at the seventh spot. Thompson was tabbed as the backup for Anderson, who started the first three weeks of the season. Thompson was put in mop-up duty for the second game before throwing twenty passes in the second game in a 20-14 loss to the New England Patriots; on the run in both games, he had a touchdown in each one. In week four against the Houston Oilers, he was tabbed to start. He went 11-of-21 for 181 yards with an interception while being sacked seven times and running for zero yards in a 30-27 loss. He did not start another game that year, but he did make appearances in five subsequent games in relief. In total, he threw for one touchdown and five interceptions while running for five touchdowns. \nThe following year saw Anthony Munoz drafted to provide support in the tackle position while Thompson and Anderson vied for playing time under new head coach Forrest Gregg. On opening day of 1980, Thompson was tabbed as the starter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The game did not go well, as he completed 6-of-21 for 47 yards with a touchdown and an interception in a miserable 17-12 loss. He was tabbed to come in for Anderson in the following two games, which included going 9-for-18 with 122 yards and two touchdowns that saw Cincinnati beat Pittsburgh 30-28. He was then tasked to start the following week against Houston and went 14-of-24 for 134 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but a last-minute drive to tie fell short in a 13-10 loss. He played sparingly for the next eleven weeks before being tabbed to start the final two games of the year against Chicago and Cleveland. In total, he threw for 1,324 yards while running for 84 that saw eleven touchdown passes to twelve interceptions while the Bengals as a whole won just six games. \n1981 was a turning point, but not for Thompson. Anderson threw three interceptions in the first half of the opening game against the Seattle Seahawks, but Thompson had suffered a sprained ankle injury in the preseason, which meant that Gregg went to Turk Schonert in relief that saw a wild comeback win. As related by Thompson later, “I was in a quarterback meeting talking to Kenny and I remember him looking at me and saying, ‘I need to be the starter. He was resolved. I said, ‘Why don't you go talk to Forrest and be done with it?’ He did, then went into that New York game and had a great game and we were off and running. I got to witness his ‘Phoenix’ moment. I have nothing but respect for that.” With his job on the line, Anderson proceeded to have a standout season that saw them go all the way to Super Bowl season while Thompson threw just 49 passes in mopup duty. His final pass as a Bengal was in the AFC Championship Game, dubbed as the \"Freezer Bowl\" due to the subzero temperatures that saw him come in and complete a 14-yard pass when Anderson was checked up for a time. \nThompson went to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1983 and was the starter, but he was replaced in the following year by Steve DeBerg.\nIn 2008, ESPN ranked Thompson no. 26 among the 50 worst NFL draft busts.\nAfter football.\nAfter his football career, Thompson settled in Seattle and became a mortgage banker, as well as a volunteer quarterbacks coach at Ballard High School. His son Tony, a tight end, followed in his dad's footsteps in suiting up at Washington State, and a nephew, Tavita Pritchard, was a quarterback at Stanford University."

        "title": "Keith Bostic (American football)",
        "text": "William Keith Bostic (born January 17, 1961) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Houston Oilers and the Cleveland Browns, serving as the Oilers' defensive captain under coach Jerry Glanville. Bostic earned one Pro Bowl selection and missed another based on a tiebreaker for the last safety chosen. In his Pro Bowl season, he led the American Football Conference in interceptions.\nPrior to playing in the NFL, he played for the Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten Conference from 1979–1982 NCAA Division I-A football season. During this time Michigan won two Big Ten championships, and Bostic was named first-team All-Big Ten. While at Michigan, he accumulated fumble recovery and interception statistics that continue to rank among the leaders in school history. Bostic had a reputation as a very physical safety.\nCollege.\nBorn in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Bostic starred at his hometown Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor. He then stayed in Ann Arbor to play for the University of Michigan where he earned four varsity letters in football from 1979 to 1982 while wearing the #13. In college at the University of Michigan, Bostic started eight games in 1980, and he had an interception in the January 1, 1981 Rose Bowl for the 1980 Big Ten Conference Champions. This game was the first bowl game victory for Bo Schembechler. He started eleven games in 1981 and twelve in 1982. Bostic was first-team All-Big Ten for the 1982 Big Ten Champions who also went to the Rose Bowl. When he was drafted into the NFL, he was second on the modern Michigan career interceptions list (since 1965) with ten career interceptions, which places him in a tie for seventh on the list now. He ranks tenth on the All-time list. He ranks second on the All-time single-season fumble recovery list with four and fourth on the career list with six. His 119 interception return yards in 1982 ranks fifth all-time.\nProfessional career.\nPre-Bostic Oilers.\nDuring the 1970s Bum Phillips had traded away draft picks for veterans several times and between the 1974 NFL Draft and the 1981 NFL Draft the team only had four first round picks, but reached the AFC Championship game twice during the decade with veterans. They went to the playoffs in 1980 as well. However, by 1981 they were below .500 with an aging team. From the 1982 NFL Draft to the 1987 NFL Draft they had nine first round choices. They complemented their drafting with the signing of Warren Moon out of the Canadian Football League and Mike Rozier out of the United States Football League (USFL), a league that attempted to compete with the NFL in the 1980s.\nBiles, Studley, Campbell era.\nBostic was drafted with the fourteenth pick of the second round of the 1983 NFL Draft with the 42nd pick overall by the Houston Oilers. He was also drafted by the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League (USFL) in the 1983 Territorial Draft. Bostic joined the Oilers who were rebuilding from being the oldest average age NFL team in 1981.\nBostic started the last 12 games of the 1983 NFL season and every game thereafter as an Oiler until leaving the team in 1989. The 1983 Houston Oilers under coaches Ed Biles and Chuck Studley went 2–14. The 1984 and 1985 teams of Hugh Campbell also were below .500. By 1985 he had nonetheless become one of the best safeties in the league. During the 1985 NFL season he had a career-high five quarterback sacks, three interceptions and a fumble recovery.\nGlanville era.\nBostic's physical style of play was well-suited for Jerry Glanville who took over the Oilers' head coaching job for the 1986 NFL season after having been the team's defensive coordinator. Bostic signed a contract extension before the 1987 NFL season. Then, Bostic earned a Pro Bowl birth in 1987 and was named second-team All-Pro the same season. During the 1987 season he finished second in the NFL with a career-high six interceptions. That total led the American Football Conference (AFC), and he added three quarterback sacks and a fumble recovery that season. Glanville took the team to both the 1987-88 and 1988-89 NFL Playoffs. The unheralded 1987 team was a surprise playoff entrant in the first round Wild Card game. Even after a surprise 1987–88 NFL playoff run the Oilers fired their defensive backs coach, Tom Bettis who had taken over from Ken Houston. Bostic earned All-Pro honorable mention in 1988. That season, he finished tied for the third and final AFC safety Pro Bowl spot with David Fulcher and missed being invited due to the tiebreaker.\nWith all the rebuilding turnover Bostic was one of the four longest tenured Oilers by his sixth season with the team. He started 88 consecutive non-strike games for the Oilers. He was replaced by Bubba McDowell as the Oilers' starting strong safety. In 1989, the Oilers became fed up with Bostic for his untimely penalties and his moody and unpredictable personality. The Indianapolis Colts signed Bostic as a plan B free agent to a two-year $900,000 contract, but released him during training camp. They released him during the second week of training camp and it was rumored he might head to the Los Angeles Raiders. The Oilers lost a league high fifteen plan B free agents that season. In 1990, the Cleveland Browns signed Bostic as a free agent. However, they waived him during the season.\nOverall reputation.\nBostic's physical style of play was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that \"The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt.\" Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a physical style, just like Hayes. Bostic is known as a big hitter blessed with athletic ability. He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: \"He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of the guys on the corner.\" Bostic earned the nickname \"Batman\" for his style of play. Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to \"...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it.\" Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.\nNFL Single Season Record.\nFewest interception return yards (1987): -14\nPersonal.\nDuring the offseasons, Bostic was a regular on the Oilers' summer basketball team that traveled around the state raising money for charities by playing various local All-star teams. After the team's twelfth season, Bostic had a reputation as the best player ever to play for the team. During one NFL training camp Bostic played with tape over his mouth to try to win a $20 bet with Steve Brown over who could keep from talking the longest.\nHis son, Tony Bostic, played running back for the New Mexico State Aggies as a non-recruited walk-on. His younger son, William, followed his father's footsteps and played linebacker for his alma mater, the University of Michigan."

He played college football for the Boston College Eagles, starting for four seasons, and was selected in the fifth round of the 1995 NFL Draft with the 141st pick. Boyd was a two-time Pro Bowl selection at middle linebacker for the Lions.\nEarly years.\nBoyd played his high school football for Valley Stream Central High School (Valley Stream, NY) for Coach Dan Tronolone, where he led the Eagles to the 1989 Nassau County Conference II Championship. A two-year captain, Boyd was selected as a Daily News All-Star his junior year after recording 102 tackles and three fumble recoveries. Boyd tabbed 92 tackles, three fumble recoveries, three interceptions and a blocked punt as a senior. He also contributed 576 yards on 104 carries with 14 touchdowns as a fullback and added 9 PATs. He was selected as the Daily News Metropolitan Player of the Year and selected to the All-Suburbun football team. He was the winner of the Thorpe Award which goes to the best football player in Nassau County. \nBoyd chose to play at Boston College after entertaining over two dozen offers including Wake Forest, Notre Dame, and Maryland. Boyd earned a starting role as a redshirt freshman in the 1991 season where he totaled 100 tackles. As a sophomore Boyd earned 2nd team All-Big East honors. During the 1993 campaign, Boyd led the Big East in tackles with 161 and was selected 1st team All-Big East. In 1994, he was elected the ECAC Player of the Year.

        "title": "Bill Bradley (American football)",
        "text": "William Calvin Bradley (born January 24, 1947) is an American former football player and coach. He played professionally as a defensive back in the National Football League (NFL), earning All-Pro honors twice. He played with the Philadelphia Eagles for most of his career. As an assistant coach he won two Grey Cups in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was also the defensive backs coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football.\nEarly years.\nA native of Palestine, Texas, Bradley was a quarterback at Palestine High School. With Bradley as quarterback, Palestine won the 1964 Texas 3A State Championship, the only one in the school's history. His running and passing skills gained him selection as a high school All-American. His football talents, including the reputed ability to pass with either hand, earned him the nickname \"Super Bill.\" He also participated in the Big 33 football game for the Texas All-Stars in 1966.\nHis father was a baseball coach and Bradley dreamed of playing professional baseball. He was a talented shortstop who was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 7th Round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was offered $20,000 to sign, but turned it down because he wanted to go to college. Instead, he played semi-pro ball with the Palestine Pals.\nCollege career.\nBradley entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1965 and became the starting quarterback and punter in 1966 as a sophomore.\nIn 1966, he led the Longhorns to a 7-4 record and a victory over Mississippi in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Injured during a win over \nIndiana, he sat out the Oklahoma game in favor of back-up Andy White, and Oklahoma notched its first win in the rivalry since 1957. Bradley came back the following week and finished the season as the Southwest Conference's leader for rushing touchdowns with 6. In the Bluebonnet Bowl, Bradley and running back Chris Gilbert each ran for over 100 yards, marking the first time that two Longhorns had run for over 100 yards in the same bowl game.\nBradley was starting quarterback again the next season. Texas started the season ranked #5, but back-to-back losses to #4 USC and Texas Tech knocked them from the rankings. They then ran off 6 straight wins before ending the season with another pair of back-to-back losses, this time to TCU and Texas A&amp;M to finish 6-4 and missing out on a bowl game. Despite the down year, Bradley led the Southwest Conference in total touchdowns with 14.\nIn 1968, Texas started the season ranked #5 and introduced the wishbone formation on offense, with co-captain Bradley at quarterback. Struggling with the new offense, Texas with Bradley under center tied #11 Houston and lost to Texas Tech. James Street replaced Bradley during the 3rd quarter of the Texas Tech game and never relinquished the position, leading the Longhorns to 9 consecutive wins, a Southwest Conference Championship and victory in the Cotton Bowl. Bradley was moved to wide receiver for two weeks, and then to defensive back and kick-off returner. As a defensive back he set the Texas and Southwest Conference records for most interceptions in a game when he picked off Texas A&amp;M four times at the end of the regular season. His final game as a Longhorn was the 36-13 win over Tennessee in the Cotton Bowl. He then played in the 1969 Hula Bowl, the Coaches All-America Game and the College All-Star Game.\nRecords.\nBold means still active\nNFL career.\nBradley was drafted in the third round of the 1969 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles as a punter/defensive back. His first season he punted and returned kick-offs and punts. The next season, he was just the punter. In 1971, he finally moved to defense, became the back-up punter and was a returner again. It was on defense that he stood out. He went on to earn three All-Pro selections (1971–73) at free safety, including first-team All-Pro in 1971 and 1972. He also played in three Pro Bowls from 1971 to 1973. His last full season of punting was 1972. He continued returning kick-offs and punts off and on for the rest of his career. Bradley led the NFL in interceptions in both 1971 (11) and 1972 (9), the first player ever to lead the league in interceptions in consecutive seasons, a feat matched only once since. In 1971, he also led the NFL in yards after an interception with 248. These achievements did not draw widespread attention, though, as the Eagles' record for those 2 years was 6–7–1 and 2–11–1; and the Eagles never made the playoffs during Bradley's tenure. He played his final year as the Eagle free safety in 1976, replaced by John Sanders.\nBradley would later recount that during his years with the Eagles, he would spend nights out on dates with members of the Philadelphia Phillies usherettes. \nIn 1977, Philadelphia traded Bradley to the Minnesota Vikings for a 7th round draft pick, but the Vikings cut him in training camp in favor of Paul Krause. Bradley went into retirement, working in his family's restaurant in Palestine, but in November of that year he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals when Mike Sensibaugh broke his leg. He had been asked to come back by other teams – including Houston, Oakland and Pittsburgh, but only accepted with St. Louis because they looked to be playoff-bound. But they lost all their remaining games that season and stayed home. Bradley played four games as a defensive back with the Cardinals and then retired for good.\nBradley is a member of the Texas High School, University of Texas, Philadelphia Eagles and Texas Sports Halls of Fame.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, Bradley worked an assortment of jobs. He had invested in a sports management company based in Philadelphia, but sold his shares in 1980 and went back to Palestine where he bought a farm and ran a gas station he owned. He also worked as a host on Norwegian Cruise lines in the 1980s and '90s.\nBradley's first coaching assignment was as defensive backs coach for the San Antonio Gunslingers of the fledgling USFL in 1983–1984. From there he moved on to the Memphis Showboats with head coach Pepper Rodgers in 1985. When the USFL folded, Bradley went back to The University of Texas as a voluntary assistant coach in 1987 for new head coach David McWilliams. He was then hired by head coach Wally Buono as the defensive back coach and defensive coordinator for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League from 1988 to 1990.\nCoach Mike Riley asked Bradley to coach the secondary for him in the World League of American Football (WLAF) as his defensive back coach from 1991 to 1993. Bradley then went back to the CFL and coached with Kay Stephenson for the Sacramento Gold Miners/San Antonio Texans in 1994–1995 as defensive coordinator before moving back to Canada with the Toronto Argonauts. There he helped win two Grey Cups in 1996 and 1997.\nSuccess in Canada gave Bradley his first chance to coach in the NFL. From 1998 to 2000, he served as defensive backs coach for Wade Phillips, Ted Cottrell and the Buffalo Bills before moving to the same position with the New York Jets from 2001 to 2003.\nBradley returned to college coaching when his former Eagle teammate Guy Morriss hired him to be defensive coordinator for 2004–2006 at Baylor University. He then returned to the NFL to reunite with Defensive Coordinator Ted Cottrell as the San Diego Chargers secondary coach from 2006 to 2008. In early 2009, Bradley and three other assistants were fired.\nDuring 2009 and 2010, he was the secondary coach for the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League. Bradley was hired to be the secondary coach of the Hartford Colonials in the UFL but the league pulled the plug on the team for lack of funds before he could coach a game.\nIn 2012, Bradley was hired by Ray Woodard as the defensive coordinator of the Lamar Cardinals football team. He retired from Lamar, and from coaching, in 2014, in part to help take care of his stepson who had suffered brain trauma as the result of a violent attack.\nIn 2018, Bradley was named the defensive backs coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the AAF."

        "text": "Charles Idus Bradshaw (December 31, 1923 – June 3, 1999) was an American college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Kentucky from 1962 to 1968 and Troy State University—now known as Troy University—from 1976 to 1982, compiling a career head coaching record of 66–68–6.\nCoaching career.\nBradshaw was an assistant coach at the University of Alabama under Bear Bryant and was on the staff that won the 1961 national championship.\nAt Kentucky Bradshaw inherited a program that had won a championship in 1950 under Bear Bryant and had been moderately well-regarded under Blanton Collier but posted a record of 25–41–4 (.386) in its previous seven seasons. Bradshaw's 1964 team was ranked #5 in the AP Poll after defeating #1 ranked Ole Miss on the road, 27–21, and beating Auburn, 20–0, for a 3–0 start, but the squad finished 5–5 after defeating Tennessee in its final game. Bradshaw's 1965 team defeated #10 Georgia, 28–10, and appeared bound for a bowl game, being ranked in the AP top ten for four weeks in September and November of that season. Bradshaw's wins in 1965 included games at Missouri, which capped the season with a Sugar Bowl victory and #6 national ranking in the final AP Poll, an upset of another bowl-bound team from Ole Miss, and another win over Georgia. The 1965 team was then set back when star quarterback Rick Norton suffered a broken leg. The Wildcats finished 6–4 and out of bowl contention. The remainder of Bradshaw's tenure at Kentucky was disappointing, although his final team did defeat a Missouri team that ended up winning the Gator Bowl and earning a #9 national ranking in the final AP Poll. The 1968 Kentucky team also defeated a ranked Oregon State team. Tackle Herschel Turner, tackle Sam Ball, halfback Rodger Bird, and quarterback Rick Norton were named first-team All Americans under Bradshaw at Kentucky.\nIn 1962, Bradshaw coached the infamous Thin Thirty at Kentucky. The varsity numbered 88 players when Bradshaw arrived in Lexington in January of that year, but by the start of the season in September there were only 30 players remaining on the squad. That season was profiled in \"Sports Illustrated\" and in a book published in August 2007, \"The Thin Thirty\", by Shannon Ragland.\nBradshaw also helped recruit Nate Northington, who became the first scholarship African-American athlete to play in an SEC game when Kentucky faced Ole Miss on September 30, 1967.\nBradshaw was the last Kentucky coach to defeat a #1 ranked team until Rich Brooks led the Wildcats to a victory over #1 ranked LSU in 2007. He was also the last Kentucky head coach to defeat the University of Tennessee twice in Knoxville, and the last Kentucky coach to post two wins against Auburn University. Bradshaw assistants who went on to be head coaches included Dave Hart (Pittsburgh), Leeman Bennett (Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Bud Moore (Kansas), Homer Rice (Cincinnati, Rice, Cincinnati Bengals), Charley Pell (Jacksonville State, Clemson, Florida) and Chuck Knox (Los Angeles Rams, Buffalo Bills, Seattle Seahawks)."

The team has won the Baseball World Cup in 1948 and World Baseball Classic in 2013. They are the first team to have won both world competitions. They are currently ranked the 9th-best in the world by the World Baseball Softball Confederation. At the Olympics in 2021 it faced Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe team competed against Team Israel, Team Puerto Rico, Team Venezuela, and Team Nicaragua in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, but ultimately failed to advance out of the first round.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2006.\nThe Dominican Republic was invited to play at the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. Placed in Pool D for the opening round, the Dominican Republic swept through the group, defeating Venezuela, Italy, and Australia at Cracker Jack Stadium in Lake Buena Vista, United States. Prior to this, Carlo Rupnik from Ottawa NCR led the DR as a top import outfielder. After falling to Puerto Rico in the first game of the 2nd round in Puerto Rico, the Dominicans recovered to qualify for the semifinals by virtue of winning their last two games. They would fall in the semifinals, however, to Cuba.\n2009.\nThe Dominicans were placed in Pool D of the 2009 World Baseball Classic, playing their opening round games at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Considered one of the pre-tournament favorites with multiple Major League Baseball All-Stars, they were upset in their opening game of the modified double-elimination pool by the Netherlands. After eliminating Panama, they faced the Dutch again for the right to advance but were stunned in 11 innings and eliminated from the competition.\n2013.\nDrawn into Pool C with Puerto Rico, Spain, and Venezuela at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico once again, the Dominicans opened the round-robin round 1 with a decisive 9–3 victory over 2009 semifinalists Venezuela. A victory over Spain and a Puerto Rico win over Venezuela ensured advancement to the second round; the Dominicans clinched the top seed by defeating the hosts. In the second round, the Dominicans rallied past upstart Italy despite an early 4–0 deficit at Marlins Park in Miami, United States. Two ninth-inning runs pushed the Dominicans past the host Americans and into the semifinals. Another victory over Puerto Rico ensured the Dominicans of the top seed and a chance to avoid two-time defending champions Japan national baseball team. Instead, they would face the surprising semifinalists Netherlands. After an early 1–0 deficit, four 5th-inning runs pushed the Dominican Republic into the final, where a 3–0 victory over Puerto Rico gave them their first-ever World Baseball Classic title. New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Canó was named MVP of the tournament.\n2017.\nThe Dominican Republic advanced out of the first round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The Dominican Republic’s win over the US set a new Marlins Park record for baseball game attendance with 37,446.

        "title": "Poland men's national ice hockey team",
        "text": "The Poland national men's ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of Poland, and a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. They are ranked 21st in the world in the IIHF World Rankings, but prior to the 1980s they were ranked as high as 6th internationally. They are one of eight countries never to have played below the Division I (former B Pool) level. As of 2024 the Polish national team plays at the top level of the World Championship.\nPoland has competed in the Olympics thirteen times, most recently in 1992, with their best result being fourth place in 1932. They have been a regular participant of the World Championship, first appearing in 1930 and having appeared in all but one tournament since 1955. They frequently played in the top division, though were in Division I after being relegated in 2002. Poland made a return to the top division of the World Championship for 2024.\nHistory.\nPoland was a regular participant of the early Winter Olympics, first competing at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where they finished ninth out of eleven teams. They would appear at ever Winter Olympics until 1956, with their best finish being fourth in 1932.\nFinanced by state coal money from the 1950s to the 1970s the Polish hockey team was a regular at the top level upsetting the Swedes, Finns, and Czechoslovaks from time to time. They hosted the World Championship for the only time in 1976, with the matches taking place in Katowice. At this tournament Poland defeated the Soviet Union 6–4 in their opening match, the first time Poland ever won against the Soviets and what is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in international hockey history. While Poland finished seventh and was relegated for the following year, their victory against the USSR helped prevent them from winning gold for only the second time in 13 years.\nIn the Olympics earlier that year, Poland played 5 matches in the top division, but lost all of them. In the first game, the team managed four goals on the West Germany but it was not enough as they lost 7–4. Four days later, after being destroyed by the Soviet Union, the Poles took on Czechoslovakia who dominated the whole game throughout and won 7–1, but after the drug testing, the officials found that one of the Czech players tested positive for doping and they awarded Poland with a 1–0 victory, although they didn't receive any points in the standings. With only two games left and no points in the standings, Poland had no shot at a medal, but still played the last two games against the United States and Finland, and lost 7–2 and 7–1 respectively.\nPoland managed to clean up a bit over four years and played well during the 1980 Olympics and finished seventh out of twelve teams. They managed to pull off a huge upset in their first game by beating Finland 5–4, who would eventually advance to the medal round. In their next game, they played Canada and hoped to complete an even bigger upset. The Canadians didn't let this happen and beat the Poles 5–1. In the third game, Poland took on the five time gold medalists, the Soviet Union. The players knew that this would be a challenge because they had played the Soviets many times before and had lost by usually very lopsided scores, such as 8–3, 9–3, 16–1, and 20–0. The Polish team, however, had also beaten the Soviets once in the 1976 World Championship and some of the players from that game were still on the team. The team tried to keep the Soviets down, but it was too much and the USSR stormed to an 8–1 win.\nWith their toughest games out of the way, Poland would have one more chance to try to get to the Medal Round. They took on the Netherlands and went down early in the first period but managed to tie it about four minutes later. The Dutch team scored twice more in the period to lead 3–1. Polish hero Wieslaw Jobczyk (who scored a hat trick in the 1976 upset against USSR) scored to put Poland within one goal but the Netherlands stormed back to get two more goals before the third period to make it 5–2. The Poles ended up losing 5–3 and saw their hopes for the medal round come to an end. They had one more game against Japan, who had not won any games in the tournament and only tied once. Poland burst out in the first period and scored 3 goals before twenty minutes had ended. They scored two more goals and Japan seemed out of it. The final score was 5–1 for Poland. The team's final record was 2–3–0 and it received 4 points in the standings.\nWhen Communist rule ended in 1989, the Polish national team began a slow decline in international play. They reached the Olympics in 1992, the most recent time they have played there, and finished eleventh out of twelve teams. During the 1990s the first two Polish-born and trained players were selected in the NHL Entry Draft: Mariusz Czerkawski was selected in the 1991 by the Boston Bruins, and Krzysztof Oliwa in 1993 by the New Jersey Devils; Oliwa won the Stanley Cup with the Devils in 2000, the first and only Pole to do so.\nPoland last competed at the Elite level in 2002 World Championship, where they finished fourteenth and were relegated. They then remained in Division I until they were relegated to Division IB in 2018, the lowest they had ever played at. The White Eagles finally returned to the elite level after finishing runner-up in group A in 2023. They will play in the 2024 IIHF World Championship in Group B.\nTournament record.\nFormer Players In NHL.\n\"Players who have played in the NHL and the Polish national team\"\nNHL Entry Draft.\n\"Polish born players selected in the NHL Entry Draft\"\nHead-to-head records.\nUpdated as of 22 April 2024.

        "title": "Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis",
        "text": "Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a 2006 table tennis simulation video game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. The game is a realistic simulation of the sport table tennis, with the main objective to make the opponent fail to hit the ball.\nThe game features various methods of serving and returning the ball, designed for players to beat their opponent. Players can compete against the game's artificial intelligence, while the game's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches, either through local multiplayer or online. Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console, the development team took advantage of the hardware's graphical power, allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware. The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. The game was released for the Xbox 360 in May 2006 and was released for the Wii in October 2007.\nIts announcement in March 2006 led to confusion and surprise, due to its significantly different style from Rockstar's previous projects. It received generally positive reviews upon release, with praise particularly directed at its simplicity, replayability and detailed visuals.\nGameplay.\n\"Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis\" is a realistic simulation of the sport of table tennis. In the game, two players hit a ball back and forth from one another. The goal of the game is to make the opponent fail to return the ball. Players have the ability to challenge a multiplayer partner, either offline or online, or can select to challenge the game's artificial intelligence. Players can select from a roster of eleven characters, which are unlocked as they progress through the game; each character has particular skills in different areas.\nThe game features two modes: Tournament, which involves players participating against a variety of players in different circuits; and Exhibition, which involves players challenging individual opponents in non-ranked matches. When preparing to serve the ball, players enter a stance. During this stance, players aim the ball, followed by selecting the amount of spin and power to place on the ball, as indicated by the spin meter.\nPlayers can also place a level of spin on their ball, curving it in a different direction. After the opponent returns the ball, players have the ability to \"charge\" their shots. As the shots are charged, the Focus meter increases; when the meter fills, players enter the Full Focus state, in which their shots are faster and more accurate. Players can also perform soft shots and smashes, respectively decreasing and increasing the speed of the ball, and Focus Shots, high-powered returns that help players counter difficult shots.\nThe Wii port of the game offers three different control schemes: Standard, using the Wii Remote; Sharp Shooter, in which the player flicks the Nunchuk's analog stick instead of the Wii Remote to aim and hit the ball; and Control Freak, using the Nunchuk's analog stick to control the player's position.\nDevelopment.\nPreliminary work on \"Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis\" began in 2005, prior to the announcement of the Xbox 360, which the game was developed for. Rockstar San Diego, the core team behind the game, found that the hardware allowed them to develop games at a faster pace than with the previous hardware. Rockstar president Sam Houser felt that Rockstar San Diego was a suitable developer for the game due to their demonstration of skill in developing advanced engines, particularly early in a console generation, citing \"\" and \"Smuggler's Run\" (both 2000), which were launch games for the PlayStation 2. Houser also said that, though the game's physics were achievable on the old hardware, the team waited for the possibility to develop for the Xbox 360 due to the \"different level of production and technology\" that it allowed. In developing the game's concept, the team was fascinated with concentrating the entire power of a particular hardware into one activity. The game runs off the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), and is the first game to do so.\nNetwork programmer John Gierach found the development of the online multiplayer mode challenging, due to the level of realism the development team attempted to create. In addition, the speed and accuracy required for the game was also a challenge for the team, due to the fast pace of the matches. When discussing the possibility of porting the game to the Wii, the team agreed almost immediately, as they felt that the console was a \"perfect fit\" for the game. While developing the Wii version, the team particularly considered how to serve all types of players, thus allowing a range of different control schemes.\nThe game was first announced by Rockstar Games on March 3, 2006. Journalists noted the surprised reactions that the announcement caused within the gaming industry, which they owed to the game's significant difference when compared to Rockstar's reputation of developing mature titles. The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in the PAL region. On July 18, 2007, Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii, taking advantage of the motion sensing Wii Remote. The Wii version was released on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in the PAL region. American table tennis player Wally Green, who performed motion capture for the game, helped promote its release in 2006; Rockstar later sponsored Green on his professional tour.\nReception.\nThe Xbox 360 version of \"Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, while the Wii version received \"average\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Reviewers praised its gameplay, detailed visuals, and online multiplayer.\nThe technical aspects of the game, such as the graphics and animation, received acclaim. \"IGN\" Douglass C. Perry felt the graphics and motion capture are \"exceptional\", and the animation is \"beautiful\", as well as praising the stable frame rate. \"GameSpot\" Ryan Davis wrote the characters were designed with \"phenomenal detail\", though felt \"there's not much else to look at\". \"GamesRadar+\" Dan Amrich commended the game's player models and lighting effects, stating they \"put the hardware to impressive yet playful use\". Tom Orry of \"VideoGamer.com\" felt the visuals improve the gameplay, particularly applauding smaller details such as the player models and ball physics.\nMany reviewers found the gameplay simple yet effective. Perry of \"IGN\" found the gameplay \"deep and addictive\", and the controls intuitive. \"GamesRadar+\" Amrich echoed similar remarks, writing the controls \"feel accessible without alienating 'serious' sports gamers\", and Orry of \"VideoGamer.com\" called the controls \"slick\". \"Eurogamer\" Tom Bramwell also praised the game's simplicity. \"The New York Times\"s Charles Herold enjoyed the simple control scheme but wrote he would rather play real table tennis.\nThe game's multiplayer mode was commended by many reviewers. \"GamesRadar+\" Amrich felt the multiplayer mode extended the game's replayability, giving players a reason to return to the game \"long after [they've] learned the weaknesses\" of the playable characters. Orry of \"VideoGamer.com\" and Bramwell of \"Eurogamer\" both named the online multiplayer \"excellent\"; the former noted minor lag but wrote the \"performance was generally very good\".\nWhen the game was ported to the Wii, the additional Wii Remote controls received positive reactions. \"IGN\" Mark Bozon felt they were an improvement over the original controls, calling it a \"huge testament to Rockstar's design\". \"Eurogamer\" Ellie Gibson found the altered controls work \"perfectly\", finding them intuitive and \"easy to grasp\". \"GameSpot\" Davis wrote that the controls \"work pretty well\", though he felt they fail to complement the gameplay. Conversely, Orry of \"VideoGamer.com\" felt the original controls \"have more depth\" than those on the Wii.\nFollowing its previews at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game won Best Sports Game from \"GameSpot\", and received a nomination from \"IGN\"."

The stadium hosted its first ICC event in October 2023 during the 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nIt is renamed after the former prime minister of India Rajiv Gandhi.\nHistory.\nBefore the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium. In 2003, the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.\nMost of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named \"Visakha International Cricket Stadium\" in 2004.\nBy 2005 when most of the stadium was built, it was ready to host its first ODI Match between India and South Africa. However, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (before the separation of Telangana) decided to change the name of the stadium to Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in memory of the former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi.\nFollowing this decision, HCA was required to pay Visakha Industries six times the contract price in accordance with the contract clauses governing any subsequent renaming of the stadium or the Visakha name not remaining attached to the stadium. HCA however, following some negotiations by Govt, got away with paying an amount of ₹43,00,00,000, i.e. the contract price only.\nThe ends are named Pavilion End and North End. On the retirement of VVS Laxman, the HCA decided to honor the veteran by naming the North End after him.\nDomestic cricket.\nSunrisers Hyderabad is a cricket franchise based in Hyderabad city. The team is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the Sun TV Network.\nPat Cummins is the captain of the team. Daniel Vettori is the head coach and Simon Helmot is the assistant coach of the team. James Franklin and Muttiah Muralitharan are the bowling coaches of the team. The team won the 2016 IPL. So far this stadium has served as the home ground of the Sunrisers and the defunct franchise Deccan Chargers.\nIts official jersey was unveiled on 8 March 2013, and the team anthem directed by GV Prakash Kumar was released on 12 March 2013. Their logo was unveiled on 20 December 2012, along with the announcement that the team's management would be led by Kris Srikkanth, Tom Moody, and VVS Laxman.\nIn IPL 2019, Hyderabad Cricket Association won the award for best ground and pitch.\nIn IPL 2024, SRH have recorded their highest team total (277/3) against MI &amp; the highest team total in IPL history at this ground which was later broken by the same team against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Bangalore after a fortnight.\nT20 Internationals.\nThe ground was scheduled to host its first Twenty20 International on 13 October 2017 against Australia. However, it was called off due to a wet outfield.\nThe ground hosted its first Twenty20 International on 6 December 2019 against West Indies. It was a high-scoring match, with India winning the match by 6 wickets. India played the 3rd T20 against Australia on September 25, 2022, at this venue. India won by 6 wickets to win the Mastercard T20I trophy. Suryakumar Yadav, who scored 69 runs (36 balls), was awarded the Player of the Match.\nIPL Records.\nAlzarri Joseph's bowling figures of 6 for 12 are the best recorded in any IPL match.\nFacelift.\nThe stadium had been selected for renovation prior to the ICC ODI Cricket World Cup in 2023. 120 crore Indian rupees had been sanctioned (by BCCI) to carry out the work of installing canopies on both east and west stands, as well as replacing seats. However, only the east stand canopy work had been completed before the world cup, and the west stand canopy work has been completed after the World Cup 2023. The floodlights layout changed due to canopies being installed. This is a much needed upgrade as the stadium hasn't undergone any major upgrades since 2005."

        "text": "Women's baseball is played in several countries. The strongest and most organized women's baseball leagues are in the United States, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Cuba, Hong Kong, and Canada. Those countries have national governing bodies that support girls' and women's baseball programs. Other countries/regions that currently have organized women's baseball are Germany, France, Netherlands, Croatia, India, South Korea, Venezuela, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Pakistan. There also is a handful of women playing baseball in Vietnam currently on the Fishanu team at Hanoi University and on the Hanoi Baseball Club.\nInternationally, the World Baseball Softball Confederation is the world governing body for women's and men's baseball, as well as women's and men's softball. The WBSC was created in 2013.\nTimeline.\nImportant events and milestones in women's baseball:\nInternational competition.\nOrganized international competition in women's baseball began with the 2001 Women's World Series played in Toronto's Skydome, (now known as the Rogers Centre). Women's World Series events were held in 2002 (St. Petersburg, Florida), in 2003 (Gold Coast, Australia), and in 2004 (Uozu-city, Japan). These Women's World Series events were organized by the American Women's Baseball Federation and the Women's Baseball Association of Japan. They paved the way for official International Baseball Federation sanctioned Women's World Cup competitions.EDELMAN, R. O. B. E. R. T., &amp; Elsey, B. (2020). Sport in Latin America.

        "title": "Brian McCann (baseball)",
        "text": "Brian Michael McCann (born February 20, 1984) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros. A seven-time All-Star and a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner, he won the 2017 World Series with the Astros.\nEarly life.\nMcCann was born to Howard and Sherry McCann in Athens, Georgia. At the time, his father worked as an assistant baseball coach for the Georgia Bulldogs Baseball under Steve Webber and his mother worked at Athens Regional Hospital. Both of his parents attended Oswego High School in Oswego, New York, where they would later be inducted into the school's athletics hall of fame. McCann's father played college baseball at Mississippi State. Howard McCann would eventually become the head coach at Marshall.\nMcCann's older brother, Brad, played at Clemson and was selected in the sixth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft by the Florida Marlins but was out of professional baseball by 2007.\nMcCann attended Duluth High School in Duluth, Georgia. He was ranked the 26th best high school prospect by \"Baseball America\" and initially committed to play college baseball for Alabama.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Atlanta Braves selected him in the second round of the 2002 MLB draft.\nAtlanta Braves (2005–2013).\nMcCann made his MLB debut with the Braves on June 10, 2005 after playing in the minor leagues for the Rome Braves. A personal catcher for John Smoltz for most of the 2005 season, McCann hit his first home run in just his second regular-season game and became the first Braves player in franchise history to hit a home run in his first playoff at-bat on October 6, 2005. He accomplished the feat in the second inning of a 7–1 victory over Roger Clemens and the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the 2005 National League Division Series. McCann was named the everyday starter when the Braves traded Johnny Estrada to the Diamondbacks.\nDuring the 2006 season, McCann hit .333 with 24 homers and 94 RBI. He led all Major League catchers in homers, and his RBI total was matched only by Jorge Posada and Victor Martinez. The Braves rewarded McCann by buying out his arbitration years with a six-year, $27.8 million contract during spring training in 2007.\nMcCann was selected to play in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, in his first full major league season, and then again in both 2007 and 2008, making him the first Braves player ever to be selected to the National League All-Star team in each of his first three seasons. In 2008, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL catcher, with 93.\nBeginning in April 2009, McCann was bothered by blurry vision in his left eye, due to a slight vision change following 2007 LASIK surgery. He decided to opt for glasses when contact lenses proved uncomfortable. In May 2009, Oakley, Inc. made special glasses for McCann to correct the vision problem and allow for comfort under the catcher's mask. McCann remarked, \"I need my Oakleys. I have to have the wraparounds for my peripheral vision.\" In 2009, he had more errors at catcher than any other major leaguer, with 12, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them (.988).\nMcCann was again selected for the All-Star Game in 2009 and 2010. In the latter, he was named the MVP after driving in all three of the National League's runs with a bases-clearing double in the seventh inning (driving in Scott Rolen, Matt Holliday, and Marlon Byrd), off of Chicago White Sox reliever Matt Thornton, giving the NL a 3–1 victory, its first in the midsummer classic since 1996. On August 29, McCann hit the first walk-off home run reviewed by instant replay. McCann hit a line drive to right field. The ball struck the top of the right field wall. The umpires called it a double, but McCann and Braves bench coach Chino Cadahia argued the call. The umpires went to go review instant replay. Replays showed that the ball struck the top of the right field wall, bounced into the stands, and then got onto the field. Thus, the umpires overturned the call and called it a walk-off home run. In 2010, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL catcher, with 84.\nDuring spring training, on March 9, 2011, McCann hit a line drive foul ball which struck minor league manager Luis Salazar, blinding him in the left eye. On May 17, 2011, McCann hit a ninth-inning, game-tying, pinch-hit home run and an 11th-inning game-winning two-run home run to defeat the Houston Astros 3–1. Also in 2011, he allowed 104 stolen bases, more than any other major league catcher.\nOn July 27, 2012, he became the first player since Jim Thome in 2007 to homer in six straight games versus an opponent. He did this on the same day Chipper Jones tied Pete Rose's major league record for extra base hits by a switch hitter.\nOn July 14, 2013, McCann was chosen by National League manager Bruce Bochy to replace injured Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman in the 2013 All-Star Game.\nNew York Yankees (2014–2016).\nOn November 23, 2013, McCann agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract with the New York Yankees, with a vesting option for a sixth year. The Yankees officially announced the deal on December 3. McCann wore the number 34 as number 16 is retired in honor of Whitey Ford.\nOn May 28, 2014, with limited options at first base, manager Joe Girardi slotted McCann into his first career start at first against the St. Louis Cardinals, going 2-for-4 with an RBI, a run scored, and a walk in a 7–4 Yankee win. On September 28, 2014, McCann entered the game against the Boston Red Sox as a pinch runner for Derek Jeter, after Jeter's final career hit. McCann led the Yankees in home runs (23) and RBI (75).\nOn September 6, 2015, McCann hit his career-high 25th home run of the season, a game-tying three-run shot off of Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays. McCann ended the season with 26 home runs and a career-high 96 RBI. On November 12, 2015, he earned his sixth Silver Slugger Award at catcher (his first in the American League).\nMcCann struggled early on during the 2016 season. After the Yankees released Alex Rodriguez, rookie catcher Gary Sánchez was brought up to share in catching duties. After Sánchez had a big impact both on offense and defense, McCann became the primary designated hitter for the team. In 130 games, McCann batted .242 with 20 home runs and 58 RBI, the ninth season in a row in which McCann hit at least 20 home runs.\nHouston Astros (2017–2018).\nOn November 17, 2016, the Yankees traded McCann to the Houston Astros for Albert Abreu and Jorge Guzmán. On April 14, 2017, McCann became the 14th catcher to record over 10,000 putouts at the position. On May 21, Houston put McCann on the 7-day disabled list for players who have sustained a concussion. Playing in only 97 games, McCann hit 18 home runs. He failed to reach 20 home runs for the first time since 2007, ending his streak at nine consecutive 20-home run seasons.\nIn the 2017 American League Championship Series, McCann hit RBI doubles in Games 6 and 7 against his former team, the Yankees, to help the Astros reach the 2017 World Series. McCann caught every inning of the World Series, and hit 5-for-25 with a pivotal home run in Game 5 as the Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games.\nOn April 23, 2018, McCann became the 10th catcher all-time to record 11,000 career putouts at the position. For the season, he batted .212/.301/.339. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league catchers, and the second-slowest speed of all major league players, at 22.7 feet/second.\nOn October 31, 2018, the Astros declined the 2019 option on his contract, making him a free agent.\nReturn to Atlanta (2019).\nOn November 26, 2018, McCann signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Atlanta Braves, marking his return to the club. He was assigned uniform number 16, the number he wore during his first stint with the Braves; Charlie Culberson, who had worn the number during the 2018 season, switched his number to 8.\nOn June 14, 2019, McCann recorded his 1,000th career RBI, a walk-off single against the Philadelphia Phillies.\nFor the season, he batted .249/.323/.412. In 2019, he had the slowest sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.2 feet/second.\nOn October 9, 2019, shortly after the Braves' Game 5 loss in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, McCann announced his retirement from baseball.\n2009 World Baseball Classic.\nMcCann played for the United States national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.\nPersonal life.\nMcCann married Ashley Jarusinski in December 2007. Their first child, a son, was born in July 2012. Their second child, a daughter, was born in September 2013. They reside in Gwinnett County, Georgia.\nIn 2017, McCann's mother married the father of Mark Teixeira. McCann and Teixeira were teammates on the Braves from 2007 to 2008 and the Yankees from 2014 to 2016.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2008, McCann released a charity wine (The McCann Merlot) with 100% of his proceeds supporting the Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research, an organization dedicated to raising funds to support pediatric cancer research and treatments. McCann also has baseball clinics for kids aged 5–18."

        "text": "James Wren \"Zack\" Taylor (July 27, 1898 – September 19, 1974) was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher with the Brooklyn Robins, Boston Braves, New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and again with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Although Taylor was not a powerful hitter, he sustained a lengthy career in the major leagues due to his valuable defensive abilities as a catcher. After his playing career, he became better known as the manager for the St. Louis Browns owned by Bill Veeck. His baseball career spanned 58 years.\nBaseball playing career.\nA native of Yulee, Florida, Taylor began his professional baseball career at the age of 16 with the Valdosta Millionaires during the 1915 season. After playing in the minor leagues for five seasons, he made his major league debut with the Brooklyn Robins on June 15, 1920, at the age of 21. He became the Robins' main catcher in 1923, succeeding Hank DeBerry. Although he led National League catchers in errors and in passed balls, Taylor also led in range factor, assists and baserunners caught stealing while batting .288 in 93 games.\nIn 1924, Taylor's batting average improved to .290 and he led the league's catchers in range factor and fielding percentage. Taylor had his best offensive season in 1925, posting career highs with a .310 batting average, 3 home runs, and 44 runs batted in. He developed a reputation as one of the best catchers in the National League, finishing the season with 102 assists and leading the league's catchers with 64 base runners caught stealing. Taylor had a talent for catching the spitball and became the personal catcher for future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Burleigh Grimes, the last pitcher allowed to throw the spitball in the major leagues. On October 6, 1925, Taylor was traded by the Robins with Eddie Brown and Jimmy Johnston to the Boston Braves for Jesse Barnes, Gus Felix, and Mickey O'Neil.\nAfter a season and a half with the Braves, he was traded to John McGraw's New York Giants along with Larry Benton and Herb Thomas for Doc Farrell, Kent Greenfield, and Hugh McQuillan. The Giants had acquired Grimes in another trade and wanted Taylor to be his personal catcher. Despite catching Grimes' team-leading 19 wins and performing well defensively to help the Giants finished the season just two games behind the pennant-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, McGraw released Taylor back to the Braves for the waiver price of $4,000 on February 28, 1928, the same day Grimes was traded to Pittsburgh. McGraw said he regretted releasing the 29-year-old Taylor, but that he wanted to give younger catchers such as Shanty Hogan a chance to play. Taylor took over as the Braves' starting catcher for the 1928 season.\nHaving been displaced by Al Spohrer as the Braves' starting catcher early in the 1929 season, Taylor's contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs for the waiver price of $7,500 in July after all the other teams in both the American and National Leagues had passed on him. When the Cubs' future Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett suffered an arm injury early in 1929, Taylor filled in capably, helping the Cubs win the National League pennant. He helped guide the Cubs' pitching staff to a league-leading 14 shutouts and finish second in team earned run average and strikeouts. In the only postseason appearance of his career in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, Taylor made only three hits but was cited as an unsung hero in a losing cause for the Cubs because of his consistent, unwavering defensive skills behind the plate. When Hartnett returned from his injury in 1930, Taylor went back to being the Cubs' backup catcher. In 1932, Cub manager Rogers Hornsby credited Taylor with helping develop the skills of Lon Warneke, as the young pitcher led the league with 22 wins.\nAfter being released by the Cubs in November 1933, Taylor appeared in four games for the Yankees in 1934 before ending his playing career as a player-coach with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1935. He played his final major league game on September 24, 1935, at the age of 36, and returned to the minor leagues as player-manager for the San Antonio Missions from 1937 to 1939 and the Toledo Mud Hens from 1940 to 1941.\nStrange incident.\nTaylor is one of the very few players who have illegally re-entered a major league game. It happened on August 31, 1932, against the Giants. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Billy Jurges pinch-hit for Taylor. Three batters later, with two outs, Taylor pinch hit for pitcher Leroy Herrmann. The Giants failed to notice: had they appealed, Herrmann would have been called out for missing his turn and the game would have been over. But Taylor and the next three batters all scored, to win the game for the Cubs.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a sixteen-year major league career, Taylor played in 918 games, accumulating 748 hits in 2,865 at bats for a .261 career batting average, along with 9 home runs, 311 runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .304. He ended his career with a .977 fielding percentage. Taylor led National League catchers three times in range factor and in base runners caught stealing, twice in assists and once in fielding percentage. His 49.63% career caught stealing percentage ranks 19th all-time among major league catchers.\nManagerial and coaching career.\nTaylor joined the St. Louis Browns as a coach in the midseason of 1941, and was a member of the 1944 Browns team that won the American League pennant – the team's only championship in its 52 years in St. Louis, although they eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1944 World Series. When Luke Sewell resigned as manager in 1946, Taylor took over as the interim manager, finished the season, then joined the coaching staff of the 1947 Pittsburgh Pirates. After Muddy Ruel managed the Browns to a last-place, 59–95 record in 1947 campaign, St. Louis general manager Bill DeWitt re-hired Taylor to be the manager. He lost 100 games in two of his five seasons as the manager of the under-funded Browns, and was fired after the 1951 season.\nTaylor was the St. Louis manager who, upon orders from then-owner Bill Veeck, called on Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during a game on August 19, 1951, against Bob Cain and the Detroit Tigers. He also participated in another Veeck stunt, in which the Browns handed out placards – reading \"take, swing, bunt\", etc. – to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions for a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign accordingly. The Browns won the game.\nTaylor remained active in baseball as a scout for the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves until his death.\nLater life.\nIn 1974, Taylor was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. He died from a heart attack while at his home on September 19, 1974, at the age of 76."

        "title": "2011 Pan American Games",
        "text": "The 2011 Pan American Games, officially the XVI Pan American Games, was an international multi-sport event held from October 14–30, 2011, in Guadalajara, Mexico. Some events were held in the nearby cities of Ciudad Guzmán, Puerto Vallarta, Lagos de Moreno and Tapalpa. It was the largest multi-sport event of 2011, with approximately 6,000 athletes from 42 nations participating in 36 sports. Both the Pan American and Parapan American Games were organized by the Guadalajara 2011 Organizing Committee (COPAG). The 2011 Pan American Games were the third Pan American Games hosted by Mexico (the first country to do so) and the first held in the state of Jalisco. Previously, Mexico hosted the 1955 Pan American Games and the 1975 Pan American Games, both in Mexico City. The 2011 Parapan American Games were held 20 days after the Pan American Games had ended.\nFollowing PASO tradition, Jalisco governor Emilio González Márquez and then Guadalajara mayor Alfonso Petersen Farah received the Pan American Sports Organization flag during the closing ceremony of the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The event was officially opened by the President of Mexico Felipe Calderón. Brett Fraser, a swimmer from the Cayman Islands, won the first Pan American Games gold medal for his country, while Saint Kitts and Nevis won its first ever Pan American Games medal of any kind.\nOrganization.\nBidding process.\nPASO selected the city unanimously as the host for 16th Pan American Games on Friday, June 2, 2006, at its 44th general assembly held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Guadalajara was the only city to officially bid for the 2011 Pan American Games. This may have been in part due to no announced and/or open candidature period for the event. Guadalajara initially bid for the 2003 Pan American Games which were held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. San Antonio, United States, which bid for the 2007 Games, declined to bid for the 2011 games.\nInfrastructure and budget.\nInspired by the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, Guadalajara used the Games as a clear way to build sports infrastructure, according to Ivar Sisniega, Guadalajara 2011 international relations and sports director. Guadalajara, a metropolitan area of five million people, is a destination for cultural and business travellers.\nHoracio de la Vega, marketing director for Guadalajara 2011, cited the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as the inspiration for infrastructure improvements. \"Barcelona wasn't Barcelona before it got the Olympic Games. In a more modest sense, we are doing the same in Guadalajara\", he said. The budget was estimated at US$200 million, of which $180 million was for sports infrastructure. Some of the funding went to general street improvement and public transportation. Dr. Carlos Andrade was the head of the organizing committee.\nHowever, as the Games drew closer to starting, it was revealed that the costs of building the venues and the athletes' village had more than tripled to US$750 million.\nThe city planned to build a new convention center and undertake road improvements. Additional plans called for transit improvements, a performing arts theater (Auditorio Telmex) and a new public library. Guadalajara increased the number of available hotel rooms by 5,000 for the games.\nBy April, Guadalajara 2011 had made over US$50 million revenue from television rights and sponsors, which was more than the previous games in Rio de Janeiro. The organizing committee had aimed for a revenue of about $70 million by the end of the Games. The organizing committee also expected to sell about one million tickets, which went on sale on May 13, 2011.\nIn June 2011, four months before the games, Carlos Andrade stated that no construction concerns remained for Guadalajara. He said that all 23 stadiums being built would be ready for the start of the games.\nMarketing.\nMarketing for the games began in 2007 at the closing ceremony of the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro with a handover ceremony to the next host city. The state and national governments arranged for signs and billboards. Two TV networks, Televisa and TV Azteca, signed contracts to broadcast the Games and to advertise them. Famous athletes from Mexico, including diver Fernando Platas and golfer Lorena Ochoa, were also named ambassadors to promote the games. The organizing committee also signed a marketing deal with SKY México, which operates in several countries. The network created a channel dedicated to the games. Classes were suspended in Guadalajara during the games to give students the chance to attend.\nSponsors.\nThere were four official sponsors for the Games: Scotiabank, Telcel, Nissan and Telmex. Accordingly, some of the venues were named after these sponsors, such as the Scotiabank Aquatics Center, Nissan Gymnastics Stadium, Telcel Tennis Complex and the Telmex Athletics Stadium. Children International was also an official benefactor of the Pan American Games. \"Second tier\" and \"third tier\" sponsors included Technogym and others.\nMascots.\nThe mascots for the 2011 Pan American Games and the 2011 Parapan American Games were Huichi, Gavo, and Leo. The organizing committee unveiled the mascots at the Plaza Andares Amphitheater in Guadalajara on November 28, 2009, and the mascots were officially named on February 10, 2010.\nThe co-creators of the mascots were José Luis Andrade (Leo), Ángel Barba Barrera (Huichi), and Fernando Sanchez (Gavo). Each received $2,584. The mascots represented the state of Jalisco and the city of Guadalajara.\nVenues.\nThe aquatic centre has two Olympic-size pools and a diving platform. The athletic facility was expanded to 15,000 during the Games and then was converted back to 5,000 seats. Puerto Vallarta was the main subsite when hosted the sailing, marathon swimming, triathlon, and beach volleyball.\nOther cities that co-hosted the event are Tapalpa (mountain biking), Ciudad Guzmán (rowing and canoeing) and Lagos de Moreno (baseball).\nThe opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Omnilife Stadium, which was constructed in 2010 for the Chivas Guadalajara team. Originally, the bigger and older Jalisco Stadium was scheduled to host the ceremonies, but the organizing committee decided to move to the newer and more technologically advanced Omnilife stadium. The change of ceremonies venue to the Omnilife Stadium organizers also held a parade to be held through the streets of Guadalajara and an increase in the use of modern technologies and a better use of the fire. Other venues that already existed in Guadalajara included the Weightlifting Forum and the CODE Dome. Most other venues for the games had to be constructed or expanded temporarily to host the games.\n10 new venues were planned including a volleyball arena, covered velodrome, shooting range, and a basketball arena. The 3,500-seat gymnastics stadium, which cost $5.5 million, opened in March 2008.\nIn total about 35 different venues were used, with a majority of them being newly built specifically for the games.\nTorch relay.\nThe Pan American Torch Relay brought the torch from Mexico City to the Estadio Omnilife for the Opening Ceremony. The flame arrives just in time for the opening ceremony.\nThe relay took the torch through all 32 Mexican states on a 50-day route starting on August 26 at the pyramids of Teotihuacan outside Mexico City. About 3,500 runners carried the torch on the 15,000-kilometer route. The torch arrived in Puerto Vallarta on October 9, Ciudad Guzmán on October 11, Tapalpa on October 12, Lagos de Moreno on October 13 and Guadalajara on October 14. The torch relay was sponsored by local nutrition company Grupo Omnilife.\nThe torch design depicted agave leaves protecting the Pan American flame. It was designed by Vatti, the same company that designed the torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The torch relay was organized by the Mexican Olympic Committee.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the games took place on October 14, 2011, at 8:00 pm CDT (01:00 UTC, October 15) at Omnilife Stadium. The opening ceremony was produced by Five Currents, who also produced the 2002 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.\nParticipating teams.\nAll 41 members of PASO competed at the Games. The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee, which had planned to continue functioning after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, had its membership withdrawn by the IOC Executive Committee at the IOC session in July 2011. However, it took steps to allow athletes to compete at the 2011 Pan American Games under the PASO flag.\nThe number of competitors qualified by each delegation is indicated in parentheses.\nSports.\n36 sports were contested in Guadalajara. With sports such as diving, a sub-discipline of aquatics, included, the number goes up to 40 sports. Futsal, which was added as a sport for the 2007 Pan American Games was dropped from the program. Rugby sevens replaced futsal at the games, appearing on the games program for the very first time. Racquetball and basque pelota also returned to the program after missing the last games in Rio de Janeiro. There were 361 medal events in total. The 2011 Pan American Games had qualification standards for every sport just like the Olympic Games. 15 out of the 26 current Summer Olympic sports, including canoeing, handball, and modern pentathlon, will use the Pan American Games as a qualifier for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each sport.\"\nMedal table.\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below with the host nation, Mexico, being highlighted. The design of the medals is intended to represent the heart of the agave plant and thus represent the Jalisco region.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony of the games took place on October 30, 2011, beginning at 8:00 pm CST (02:00 UTC, October 31) at Omnilife Stadium. As per tradition, the Pan American Sports Organization flag was handed over to the mayor of the next host city, Rob Ford of Toronto.\nConcerns and controversies.\nSecurity.\nGuadalajara, due to the ongoing Mexican Drug War, has seen escalating violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games in light of the drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report to the rest of the committee in which he said, \"We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think we have a good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes\". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.\nAthletes' village.\nThe athletes' village was behind schedule for the entire time it was under construction, and in May 2011, about five months before the start of the games, the courts ordered work on the village to halt when residents of Zapopan said the construction would adversely affect their drinking water supply. Carlos Andrade Garin, the director of the organizing committee, said even a short delay in construction would mean the games would have to be canceled.\nAccording to Garin, \"we have some crabs [people who don't want to go forward] who don't like our state to grow, who don't like us having a great event, whose own related interests are more important than those of the community. Unfortunately, you can't do anything against this kind of people, except get on with our own job.\"\nAfter many delays, organizers finally asserted that the athletes' village would be finished no later than September, only a month before the games were to begin. The village was expected to be handed over to COPAG by August 22, 2011.\nVenue delays.\nAnother concern with the Games was that venue construction had fallen behind. In 2009, two years before the start of the games, the athletes' village was still not under construction and the aquatics and athletics stadiums fell way behind schedule. Some venues and the athletes village were finished only a few weeks before the start of the games, including the Telcel Athletics Stadium and the beach volleyball stadium in Puerto Vallarta. This meant that not all disciplines could have a test event before the games began. Organizers guaranteed that all the sports venues being built for the games would be ready before September 2011. Many of the venues were scaled down, including the Telmex athletics stadium, which had the number of seats halved. During the election of the host city of the 2015 Pan American Games, PASO president Mario Vázquez Rana said that if Guadalajara did not address the delays, Toronto, the host of the next games, would step in and replace Guadalajara as host. In August 2011, the athletics stadium was further delayed by constant rain which prevented the installation of the track. This development put the test event scheduled for September at risk of being cancelled. Several days before the opening ceremony, the organizing committee announced that they were optimistic that the venues would be ready by the start of the games.\nAllegation of tainted meat.\nThe German National Anti-Doping Agency warned athletes that some meat in Mexico had tested positive for the stimulant clenbuterol. However, Games officials said that food served at the athletes' village would be tested to ensure it contained no drugs or contaminants."

        "text": "Boxing is a video game interpretation of the sport of boxing developed by programmer Bob Whitehead for the Atari VCS (later renamed to the Atari 2600). It was published by Activision in 1980. It's one of the first video games developed by Activision. The game is based on \"Boxer\", an unreleased 1978 arcade game from Whitehead's previous employer, Atari, Inc. \"Boxer\" was written by Mike Albaugh who also wrote \"Drag Race\" for Atari, a game cloned by Activision as \"Dragster\".\nGameplay.\n\"Boxing\" shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a \"knockout\") or two minutes have elapsed (a \"decision\"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.\nWhile the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the \"ropes\" and \"juggling\" him back and forth between alternate punches.\nReception.\n\"Boxing\" was reviewed by \"Video\" magazine in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it was described as \"demonstrat[ing] Activision's willingness to strike out boldly in new directions\" and praised for keeping things from \"becoming needlessly complex\" by making automatic punch-type selection for the player.\nLegacy.\n\"Boxing\" was made available on Microsoft's \"Game Room\" service in 2010.\nIn 2011, an extended academic version of the game, called \"Clever Boxer\", was developed as a benchmark for Game AI."

        "text": "Bowling railway station serves the village of Bowling in the West Dunbartonshire region of Scotland. This station is on the North Clyde Line, between Kilpatrick and Dumbarton East, from Glasgow Queen Street measured via Maryhill. The station is managed by ScotRail who provide all train services.\nHistory.\nThe station was opened on 15 July 1850 by the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway, and resited a few years later in 1858.\nAccidents and incidents.\nOn 8 September 1933, a passenger train collided with wagons on the line due to a signalman's error. Five people were injured.\nIn October 2023, severe flooding took place around the River Clyde following a severe weather warning from the Met Office. The \"Glasgow Times\" described the station as being \"underwater\" while The Herald called the station \"inundated with muddy water...[the] flood rising almost to the platform’s edge\".\nFacilities.\nThe station is unstaffed, and only comprises basic shelters, benches, help points, a payphone and a few cycle stands. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.\nPassenger volume.\nThe main origin or destination station for journeys to or from Bowling station in the 2022/23 period was Glasgow Queen Street, making up 5,892 of the 25,434 journeys (23.17%).\nServices.\nOn weekdays and Saturdays, there is a half-hourly service to Balloch northbound and Airdrie southbound. On Sundays, trains run twice per hour to Balloch as normal, but run southbound to Motherwell (with one going via Whifflet, the other via Hamilton Central).\nCultural references.\nThe station was made famous by a 1960 painting by the renowned railway artist, the late Terence Cuneo, who depicted a then new Blue train (Class 303) heading westbound into Bowling, passing a steam engine, which the 303 had replaced, in a siding. The painting was used as a poster 'Glasgow Electric'."

        "title": "Victorian Premier Cricket",
        "text": "Victorian Premier Cricket is a club cricket competition in the state of Victoria administered by Cricket Victoria. Each club fields four teams (firsts through to fourths) of adult players and usually play on weekends and public holidays. Matches are played on turf wickets under limited-time rules, with most results being decided on a first-innings basis.\nOutstanding players in the competition are selected to play for the Victorian Bushrangers at first-class and List A level, in the Sheffield Shield and Marsh One Day Cup competitions respectively. The competition commenced in the 1906–07 season when it was known as \"District cricket\", and was renamed in 1990. Separate competitions for one-day matches (2002–03) and Twenty20 (2005–06) were later established.\nHistory.\nInter-club cricket in Melbourne had its beginnings during the 1850s, with matches arranged on an informal basis. The newspapers usually decided the season's best team via the consensus of journalists. In 1870, the Challenge Cup was introduced, beginning an era of more structured competition.\nFor the 1889–90 season, a program of Pennant Matches was devised over eight rounds, which began the era of club competition recognisable today. The original competing teams were Carlton, Essendon, East Melbourne, Fitzroy, Melbourne, North Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Richmond, St Kilda, South Melbourne, University of Melbourne and Williamstown. There were no restriction on the recruitment of players and the stronger clubs (such as East Melbourne, Melbourne and South Melbourne) attracted the leading players, and other teams remained very weak. By the turn of the twentieth century, the unevenness of the competition resulted in a lack of public support.\nThe solution was found in \"electorate\" or \"District\" cricket whereby players needed a residential qualification to play for their club. In 1903, a VCA sub-committee recommended the implementation of the system. Due to many differences of opinion (most notably, the powerful Melbourne Cricket Club dissented), District cricket did not commence until 1906.\nThe twelve inaugural District teams were Carlton, Collingwood (newly formed), East Melbourne, Essendon, Fitzroy, Hawksburn (which became Prahran the following year), Melbourne, North Melbourne, Richmond, St Kilda, South Melbourne and University of Melbourne. A promotion and relegation system between two grades was originally envisioned, and the premier club of second grade, Northcote, was promoted for 1907–08. However, last-placed Collingwood was not relegated and the idea dispensed with. The second grade was re-constituted as the Victorian Sub-District competition, comprising Brighton, Caulfield, Coburg, Elsternwick, Hawthorn, Malvern, Port Melbourne and Williamstown.\nThe uneven number of teams necessitated a bye, which remained until 1929–30 when the VCA Colts team comprising under-22s across all districts was included. The Colts team competed for eleven seasons but disbanded during World War II. Matches continued through the war (although they were not for points) and Footscray was admitted for 1948–49, which eliminated the bye. The next expansion occurred in 1974 when two clubs representing outer-suburban areas, Ringwood and Waverley, were promoted from Sub-District. Eighteen sides have participated since 1993–94 when teams from Geelong and the Mornington Peninsula were admitted. The finals system, previously consisting of four teams, was enlarged to a final six in 1997–98 season, later changing to a final eight.\nVictorian Premier Cricket Club Teams (Current).\nPremierships correct to the end of 2022/23 season.\nRyder Medal.\nFirst presented in 1972–73, the award for the best player of the season is named after Jack Ryder, the former Australian captain who had a long and distinguished career with Collingwood.\nJohn Scholes Medal.\nPresented in season 2001–02 under the name of Cricket Victoria Medal, the John Scholes medal is awarded to the best player in the Victorian Premier Cricket 1st XI final. The name was changed for the 2003–04 season.\nAdministration.\nVictorian Premier Cricket was run by the Cricket Victoria's Pennant Committee until the end of the 2013/14 season. The role of the Pennant Committee was in relation to dealings with grounds, fixtures, playing dates, venues, umpires, ladders, player eligibility and registrations, disputes, rules changes etc. The Pennant Committee comprised five delegates elected at the AGM of Cricket Victoria held every August. The members of the final Pennant Committee were John McConville (chairman), Kevan Carroll, John Malligan, Ken Stone, Oswin Wright and Peter Binns (ex-officio). Matters concerning player behaviour are dealt with a tribunal convened by Cricket Victoria and is made up of an independent chairman two Pennant Committee members, providing that their club is not involved in the match in question.\nSince 2014/15, the Premier Cricket Management Team (PCMT) began overseeing the administration of Premier Cricket at Cricket Victoria. As of season 2021/22, this has now become a Premier Cricket Department listed in charge of the day-to-day operations with Victorian Premier Cricket."

The team is organised by the Japan Cricket Association (JCA), which has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1989. Japan made its international cricketing debut at the 1996 ACC Trophy in Malaysia. Most of the team's matches are played in regional competitions, generally against other teams in the ICC East Asia-Pacific development region. Between 2008 and 2012, Japan participated in the World Cricket League (WCL), reaching WCL Division Five at one point.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Japan and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Japan in the 1860s, by the British, but did not become organised until the 1980s, when the Japan Cricket Association was formed. They became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1989, and the national team first played in the 1996 ACC Trophy, losing all their games including a 380 run defeat by Fiji. They continued without success in the 1998 tournament and the 2000 tournament.\nAfter the 2000 ACC Trophy, they left the Asian Cricket Council and became part of the ICC's East Asia/Pacific region. They played in the East Asia Eights tournament in Australia in February 2002, finishing as runners-up to an Australian indigenous team. Indonesia and South Korea were the other teams in the tournament. In 2004, they hosted the East Asia Pacific Cricket Challenge tournament as part of qualification for the 2007 World Cup, finishing third after beating Indonesia in a play-off.\nIn June 2005, Japan were promoted to associate membership of the ICC and that year they played in the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup in Vanuatu, winning the tournament after beating the Cook Islands in the final. The following year they played in the 2006 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy in Brisbane finishing last in the three team tournament that also involved Fiji and the Cook Islands.\nIn December 2007 Japan took part in the 2007 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy in Auckland, New Zealand, playing against the Cook Islands, Indonesia, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. Japan won the tournament and qualified for Division Five of the World Cricket League where they finished in tenth place out of the twelve countries represented in Jersey.\nOn March 22, 2016, it was announced that Sano, Tochigi, would be home to the Sano International Cricket Ground, which will become Japan's first dedicated purpose-built cricketing venue which no longer had to compete with other sports for usage.\nOn October 9, 2022, Japan played their first ever T20 international match against Indonesia. In January 2023 it was announced that Japan and Indonesia would be included in Asian Cricket Council (ACC) pathway events, while remaining in the ICC East Asia-Pacific development region. Japan was formally readmitted to ACC membership in January 2024, with Indonesia also joining as a member.\nJapan will be participating at 2022 Asian Games cricket tournament.
