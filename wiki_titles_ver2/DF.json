The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected Rube Foster and Johnny Mize. Foster would be one of two people from the Negro leagues elected in seventeen years, before introduction of a separate ballot in 1995. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 2, 1981, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1961 or later, but not after 1975; the ballot included candidates from the 1980 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1975. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1981 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 15. The ballot consisted of 39 players; a total of 401 ballots were cast, with 301 votes required for election. A total of 3,026 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.55 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 17 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nTed Kluszewski was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 18 All-Stars, three of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 71 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 11-time All-Star Harmon Killebrew, 9-time All-Star Juan Marichal, 8-time All-Star Bob Gibson, 7-time All-Star Thurman Munson and 5-time All-Star Leo Cárdenas. The field included three MVPs (Gibson, Killebrew and Munson), two Cy Young Award winners (Bob Gibson, who won twice while receiving MVP in one of those years, and Jim Perry) and one Rookie of the Year (Munson).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Ed Brinkman, Danny Cater, Tom Egan, Bob Locker, Tommy McCraw, Jim Merritt, Gene Michael, Orlando Peña, Paul Popovich, Eddie Watt, Walt Williams and Clyde Wright.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nJoe Reichler (1915–1988) and Milton Richman (1922–1986) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring baseball writers. The awards were voted at the December 1980 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1981 ceremonies."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around was an artistic gymnastics event held as part of the gymnastics at the 1920 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fifth appearance of the event. The competition was held on Wednesday, 25 August 1920. 25 gymnasts from seven nations competed. Nations had been limited to 6 gymnasts each since 1912. The event was won by Giorgio Zampori of Italy, the nation's third consecutive victory in the men's individual all-around. France's Marco Torrès took silver and Jean Gounot earned bronze, stretching the French podium streak to three Games as well.\nThe gymnastics programme in 1920, just as in 1912, featured an individual all-around and three different team events. The individual all-around scores were \"not\" used for the team events. No separate apparatus competitions were held.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nTwo of the top 10 gymnasts from the pre-war 1912 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Giorgio Zampori of Italy and seventh-place finisher Marco Torrès of France. Torrès was the favorite and reigning World Champion, having won in 1913 (as well as previously in 1909); no major gymnastics events had been held since World War I (the 1919 Inter-Allied Games did not include the sport).\nEgypt and Monaco each made their debut in the event. France and Italy each made their fourth appearance, tied for most among nations, both having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe format for the all-around competition varied widely at early Games. The 1920 competition added a floor exercise, bringing the number of apparati used to 5 (floor, rings, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and pommel horse). A total of 8 exercises were performed by each gymnast, with a compulsory and an optional exercise in each of the parallel bars, horizontal bar, and rings as well as optional exercises on the floor and pommel horse. The 12-point scale from 1912 was modified to a 10-point scale with a 2-point addition for finishing the exercise, so the total score possible for the exercise remained 12. (Unlike 1912, the gymnast received a single score of up to 12 for each exercise rather than 3 separate judges' scores for a total of up to 36 for each exercise.) With eight exercises, the maximum score was 96."

Ten rowers, each from a different nation, competed. The event was won by John B. Kelly Sr. of the United States, the nation's second victory in the event (tying Great Britain for most among nations at the time). It was the first of Kelly's three Olympic gold medals; he would also win in the double sculls about an hour later (a double that has never been repeated) as well as in the 1924 double sculls. In the final, Kelly defeated Great Britain's Jack Beresford in \"of the greatest sculling races ever contested.\" Beresford led most of the way, with Kelly passing him late and winning by one second—a very close race in single sculls. The final held particular significance to Kelly, who had only decided to participate in the Olympics after being excluded from the 1920 Diamond Challenge Sculls; Kelly had wanted \"to get a crack at the man who wins the diamond sculls\"—which had turned out to be Beresford.\nDarcy Hadfield took bronze, the first Olympic medal for New Zealand as a separate nation (New Zealand had previously competed with Australia as \"Australasia\" in 1908 and 1912).\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe competition featured a historically great field. John B. Kelly Sr. and Jack Beresford are cited as the best scullers to have ever come from the United States and Great Britain, respectively. Kelly had won six national championships and put together a 126-race winning streak in 1919 and 1920. Beresford had won the 1920 Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1920 and would win the Wingfield Sculls seven consecutive times, as well as winning five Olympic medals at five different Games (and in four different rowing events). Kelly had been excluded from the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1920, primarily due to a ban on the Vesper Boat Club to which he belonged, though his work as a bricklayer was also cited as a violation of amateurism rules. Other prominent scullers competing in Antwerp included 1920 European champion Max Schmid of Switzerland and 1919 Inter-Allied champion Darcy Hadfield of New Zealand.\nCzechoslovakia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its fourth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition featured three rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final), with more than two boats to a race for the first time since 1904. The quarterfinals consisted of four heats of either two or three boats each, with the top sculler in each heat advancing. The four quarterfinal winners were separated into two semifinals of two boats each; the winner of each advanced to the final. There was no bronze medal race, but only one of the semifinal losers received bronze. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912."

Switzerland (Édouard Candeveau, Alfred Felber, and cox Paul Piaget) earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nItaly and Switzerland each made their debut in the event. Belgium and France each made their second appearance, having previously competed in 1900.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition featured two rounds (semifinals and a final). There were three semifinals; the winner of each advanced to the final. As there were only four boats after withdrawals, two of the three semifinals ended up being walkovers. The three-boat final determined the medals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912."

        "text": "The men's coxed four event was part of the rowing programme at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The competition was held on 28 and 29 August 1920. It was the third appearance of the event, which had previously been held inaugural rowing competitions in 1900 as well as in 1912. Eight boats (40 competitors), each from a different nation, competed. The medals all went to nations that had not won a medal in the men's coxed four previously: Switzerland and the United States took gold and silver, respectively, in their debuts in the event; Norway took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nThe top nations in the coxed four coming into the Games included Switzerland (1920 European champions), France (1919 Inter-Allied champions), and Canada. France did not compete in the event at the Olympics, however, and Canada's team boat did not make it to Antwerp.\nBrazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and the United States each made their debut in the event. Belgium, Norway, and Sweden competed for the second time, matching the absent France and Germany for a five-way tie for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe tournament featured two rounds of competition, with no repechages. The semifinals had three heats, with 2 or 3 boats in each heat. The winner of each semifinal advanced to the final, with all other boats eliminated. There was a single final, with three boats, to determine the medals.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal 1.\nThe first heat featured the two top teams: Switzerland and Canada. The Canadian team had to use a borrowed boat when their own did not arrive in Antwerp. One of the riggers cracked immediately before the race started; the team managed to get into the lead anyway. However, the other shoulder of the rigger failed during the race and Canada had to row with only three oars for the remainder of the race."

Eight boats (72 competitors), each from a different nation, competed. It was the first time that nations were limited to a single boat. The event was won by the United States in a final against Great Britain; the two nations had taken all four previous gold medals (the United States winning in 1900 and 1904, when Great Britain did not compete; Great Britain winning in 1908 and 1912, when the United States did not compete). Bronze went to Norway, the nation's first medal in the men's eight. In addition to gold medals, the winners received a challenge prize that had been donated by Eugenio Brunetta d'Usseaux before his death in 1919.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe two-time defending Olympic champion was the Leander Club of Great Britain. The United States had won the previous two Games, both times represented by the Vesper Boat Club; in 1920, the American squad came from the United States Naval Academy. The two teams were favoured at the 1920 Games. Another contender was Switzerland, the 1920 European Rowing Championships winners.\nCzechoslovakia and Switzerland each made their debut in the event.

The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe 1920 tournament featured three rounds of one-on-one races; with 8 boats in the competition, the bracket was perfectly balanced.

        "text": "In baseball, a grand slam is a home run that is hit when the bases are loaded (i.e., there are runners occupying first, second, and third base simultaneously), thereby scoring four runs—the most possible in one play. Thirteen players have hit two grand slams in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Josh Willingham of the Washington Nationals on July 27, 2009. No player has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever hit more than two in a game. Tony Lazzeri was the first player to hit two grand slams in a single game, doing so for the New York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics on May 24, 1936.\nEvery team which had a player hit two grand slams won their milestone games. These games have resulted in other single-game MLB records being set due to the prodigious offensive performance. Lazzeri, for example, proceeded to hit a third home run in the game and finished with a total of eleven runs batted in, an American League record. Fernando Tatís became the only player to hit two grand slams in the same inning, when he attained the milestone, slugging two in the third inning for the St. Louis Cardinals on April 23, 1999. In achieving the feat, he also set a new major league record with eight runs batted in in a single inning.\nTony Cloninger is the only pitcher to have accomplished the feat. Bill Mueller hit his grand slams from both sides of the plate, while Jim Northrup hit his grand slams on consecutive pitches received in the fifth and sixth innings. Nomar Garciaparra is the sole player to achieve the feat at home, doing so at Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox. Cloninger is the only player who never hit a grand slam before or after his milestone game, while Robin Ventura—with 18 grand slams—hit more than any other player in this group. Frank Robinson is also a member of the 500 home run club.\nOf the nine players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have hit two grand slams in a game, two have been elected, one on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave ineligible one player—Jim Tabor—who did not play in 10 seasons.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "In baseball, a triple is recorded when the ball is hit so that the batter is able to advance all the way to third base, scoring any runners who were already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league is recognized for leading the league in triples. Only triples hit in a particular league count toward that league's seasonal lead.\nThe first triples champion in the National League was Ross Barnes; in the league's inaugural 1876 season, Barnes hit fourteen triples for the Chicago White Stockings. In 1901, the American League was established and led by two members of the Baltimore Orioles: Bill Keister and Jimmy Williams each had 21. Sam Crawford and Turkey Stearnes each led their respective leagues (the American League and Negro league baseball) six times, which is the most for any player."

        "text": "The 2007 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament began on November 29, 2007, with 64 teams and concluded on December 15, 2007, when Penn State defeated Stanford 3 games to 2 in Sacramento, California for the program's second NCAA title.\nPenn State, who was making their first final four appearance since 1999, finished the season on a 26 match win streak. Their last loss of 2007 came against Stanford in five games. Semifinalist California made the program's first NCAA Final Four appearance after upsetting defending champion Nebraska in the quarterfinals.\nWith Stanford, California and Southern California making the Final Four, it became the second straight year that the Final Four consisted of three Pac-10 teams. However, for the second straight year, it was the team from the different conference that won the national championship.\nStanford Regional.\nRecap.\nThere were generally no major upsets in this bracket region. Overall #1 seed Stanford advanced to the final four for the second straight year with a 3–1 victory over Pac-10 foe UCLA.\nStanford Regional All-Tournament Team:\nGainesville Regional.\nRecap.\nThe biggest upset in the Gainesville bracket was #5 seed USC surprisingly sweeping #4 seed Texas, ending Texas' 24 match win streak.\nGainesville Regional All-Tournament Team:\nUniversity Park Regional.\nRecap.\nThe first major upset seen in this bracket was unseeded and unranked BYU defeated six seeded and 2006 national semifinalist Washington on Washington's home court. Before the loss, Washington was undefeated at home in postseason play, boasting a 13–0 record. The second major upset was unseeded Middle Tennessee defeating 11th seeded Hawai'i in the second round. It was the first time in school history Hawai'i lost in the second round, and was also the first time in school history that Middle Tennessee advanced to the sweet 16. Another upset was unseeded Michigan defeating 14th seeded Colorado State.\nPenn State, the #3 overall seed, swept past each opponent to advance to their 6th final four in school history and first since winning the NCAA title in 1999. Big Ten Freshman of the Year Arielle Wilson was named the regional most outstanding player.\nUniversity Park Regional All-Tournament Team:\nMadison Regional.\nRecap.\nThe biggest upset in the NCAA tournament occurred in the Madison regional final, where #10 seed California defeated defending champion and #2 seed Nebraska in a sweep. Nebraska saw their dominance slipping after having to come up from 2 games down in the regional semifinals against unseeded Michigan State. Nebraska has also never won a regional final outside of the state of Nebraska, with the exception of the 2006 tournament when they came from 2 games down to defeat Minnesota, and eventually went on to win the title in Omaha, Nebraska. California advanced to their first final four in school history.\nMadison Regional All-Tournament Team:\nNational Semifinal recap.\nStanford vs. Southern California.\nUSC started off the match taking the first game, 30–23. Stanford took the next two games, 30-20 &amp; 30–25, before USC took the next game 30–20 to force a 5th game. The 5th game was back and forth, before Stanford saw a 2-point deficit at 11–9. Stanford rallied to tie the match at 12 all. The teams traded points before the score was tied at 13. USC took the next point to earn match point, but a service error on match point tied the game up at 14. Stanford took the next two points to win the match and 5th game, 16–14.\nPenn State vs. California.\nPenn State defeated California in a sweep, 30–28, 30–25, 30–16. The first game was tied at 28 before a solo block from Blair Brown gave Penn State the game, 30–28. The second game was not as close as Penn State won 30–25, and the third game Penn State won easily 30–16. Penn State advanced to their 5th national championship match in school history.\nNational Championship recap: Stanford vs. Penn State.\nIn front of the second highest crowd in NCAA history to watch a women's volleyball championship match, Penn State, coached by 2007 AVCA National Coach of the Year Russ Rose, was ranked #1 in the AVCA coaches poll since October, but Stanford was the #1 seed, while previously ranked #4 in the poll. This was the third time in a decade that the two teams have met in the NCAA title match, tying an NCAA record. The teams previously met in 1997, when Stanford won in a five-game match, and two years later, when Penn State won in a sweep. Additionally, Penn State and Stanford are the only Division I universities that have made every NCAA tournament appearance since NCAA starting sponsoring in 1981.\nComing into the match, Penn State had the highest hitting percentage in the nation as a team, while Stanford was ranked number 4. The first game started out back at forth with Stanford holding a slight edge at the media timeout at 15–13. The difference proved to be a 6–0 run after the timeout that separated Penn State from Stanford as the Cardinal never got closer than 3 points, with Penn State winning 30–25. The second game was much like the first as it featured many lead changes and ties. Penn State remained in control, never allowing Stanford to get closer than three points, thus winning 30–26 and sending Stanford in the locker room with their first 0–2 deficit of the season.\nIn the third game, Stanford responded and took control of the third, by winning 30–23, and handing Penn State their first single game loss of the tournament, as Penn State swept through each opponent until that point, ending their bid to become just the 3rd school in NCAA history to sweep through each opponent en route to winning the NCAA title. The fourth game was all Stanford as Penn State saw them take the second game, 30-19 as Stanford did not record a hitting error, and force a 5th game. This was the first five-game match in a championship since rally scoring began in 2001.\nIn the decisive 5th game, Penn State saw Stanford take a 4–3 lead out of Penn State errors, but after that, it was all Nittany Lions as they did not allow Stanford a single kill in a 7–0 scoring run to take their biggest lead of the night at 10–4. Stanford was not able to get any closer than 4 points. Stanford took their last point on their only kill of the game, but Penn State took the next points to earn match point on a block and MVP Megan Hodge's 26th kill of the match sealed the championship, 15–8. As a team, Stanford hit negatively, with 1 kill, 4 errors on 19 attempts to hit -.158%, compared to Penn State's 11 kills, 5 errors on 21 attempts to hit .286% in the fifth game. Penn State outhit Stanford for the match, .317 to .291, just the second time all season Stanford was outhit. This win snapped a 12-match winning streak by Stanford, while it was the 26th consecutive match won by Penn State, as their last loss of the season was to Stanford exactly three months before on September 15, 2007, in another five game thriller.\nNCAA Tournament records.\nThere were three NCAA tournament records that were set in the 2007 tournament that still stand."

        "text": "Men's college basketball on television includes the broadcasting of college basketball games, as well as pre- and post-game reports, analysis, and human-interest stories. Within the United States, the college version of basketball annually garners high television ratings.\nNot all games are televised. Coverage is dependent on negotiations between the broadcaster and the college basketball conference or team. In general, major programs will be televised more often than smaller programs. The televised games may change from year-to-year depending on which teams are having a strong season, although some traditional rivalry games are broadcast each year. Major match-ups between top-ranked teams or major rivals are often broadcast nationally. Some games are traditionally associated with a specific event or holiday, and viewing the game itself can become a holiday tradition for fans.\nHistory.\nCollege basketball was first televised during the \"experimental\" era of television's broadcasting history, when W2XBS broadcast a men's basketball doubleheader from Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 28, 1940. Fordham University and the University of Pittsburgh played in the first game, and New York University played Georgetown University in the second game.\nIn 1968, the \"Game of the Century\", played between UCLA and Houston, was syndicated by the TVS Television Network, attracting a significant television audience. The game is widely cited as a catalyst for the explosion and expansion of the televised college basketball landscape.\nBroadcast rights.\nNetworks.\nIn addition, some regional syndicators broadcast games on over the air television. Most notably, Raycom Sports syndicate their games to broadcast stations. ESPN Plus, which was a syndication unit of ESPN, also previously syndicated basketball games from various conferences to stations until its 2014 closure in the wake of Big 12 games moving to the ESPN cable networks, and the inception of the cable-only SEC Network. In 2014, Sinclair Broadcasting launched a new syndication programming service, the American Sports Network, to syndicate basketball games in various areas of the country, including a few NCAA Division II games (beginning in 2016).\nRaycom in the early 1990s paid ABC $1.8 million for six weeks of network airtime of 26 regional games. The format allowed Raycom to control the games and sell the advertising.\nCable stations.\nRegional cable networks have long devoted coverage to one or two conferences. The Pac-12 and Big 12 have had deals with Fox Sports since 1996, which airs games on its regional family of networks.\nIn August 2007, the Big Ten conference was the first to establish its own television network, the Big Ten Network. The Pac-12 Networks debuted in 2012. Two years later, ESPN and the Southeastern Conference launched the SEC Network. In August 2019, the ACC has launched the ACC Network. This network will replace the games currently broadcast by Raycom Sports.\nTexas has their own deal which created the Longhorn Network in fall of 2011. While BYU has BYUtv, it is not a separate deal that created a regional sports network.\nESPN.\nESPN has been airing regular season games since 1980, ESPN2 since 1993, ESPNU since 2005, and to a lesser extent ESPN Classic will show fewer games per season.\nCollege basketball has been a staple for nearly the whole history of ESPN. Scotty Connal, then-vice president of the all-sports network in Bristol, Conn., offered Dick Vitale a position, shortly after being fired from the Detroit Pistons. The coverage of \ncollege basketball and the early rounds of the NCAA tournament increased both college basketball and ESPN's credibility.\nVirtual Reality.\nIn 2016, Fox partnered with NextVR to live stream four Big East Conference games in virtual reality.\nCurrent lineup.\n\"By home team\"\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nIn 1974, Brent Musburger started using the term March Madness when describing the tournament.\nIn 1991, CBS received exclusive rights to the entire tournament for the first time. Previously, ESPN had aired early round games. Beginning in 2011, CBS shared the early tournament rounds with TBS, TNT, and TruTV. The Final Four will alternate between CBS and TBS starting in 2016.\nNIT.\nThe ESPN family of networks currently air the NIT games.\nCBI.\nAXS TV carries select games from the CBI.\nCIT.\nCBS Sports Network has broadcast the semifinal round and championship game of CIT since 2014. The rest of the tournament games are available for free stream on the tournament website."

A total of 80 fencers from 13 nations competed in the event, which was held from August 20 to 23, 1920. Each nation was limited to eight fencers, down from 12 in 1908 and 1912. Of the six fencing events, the only one in which Nedo Nadi did not win a gold medal was the one in which he did not compete. Instead, a trio of Frenchmen (Armand Massard, Alexandre Lippmann, and Gustave Buchard) swept the medals. It was Lippmann's second silver medal in the event, he having previously taken second in 1908; he was the second man to win multiple medals in the individual épée.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFour of the eight finalists from the 1912 Games returned: silver medalist Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier of Denmark (who competed in seven Games from 1908 to 1948), fourth-place finisher Victor Boin of Belgium, seventh-place finisher Léon Tom of Belgium, and eighth-place finisher Martin Holt of Great Britain. The French and Italian teams, both of whom boycotted the 1912 Games over separate rules disputes, returned, including 1908 silver medalist Alexandre Lippmann.\nCzechoslovakia and Egypt each made their debut in the event. Belgium, Great Britain, and the United States each appeared for the fourth time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin, with bouts to 1 touch. Double-touches counted as touches against both fencers. Rather than hold separate barrages to separate fencers tied in the advancement spot (as had been done in 1908), the head-to-head results of bouts already fenced were used (as in 1912). The size of the pools was increased; where previously the maximum size of a pool was 8, now the final and semifinals consisted of 12 fencers each with the quarterfinals and first round pools also larger.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nPool C.\nOlivier advanced to the final after Otto Baerentzen (5th in Pool I) withdrew."

        "title": "1940 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1940 Rose Bowl was the 26th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 1.\nIn a matchup of undefeated teams, the third-ranked USC Trojans of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) shut out the #2 Tennessee Volunteers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), 14–0. USC quarterback Ambrose Schindler was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nTeams.\nThe Rose Bowl committee had both USC and Tennessee on their list and it was likely that USC and Tennessee would play each other. The Volunteers were offered a berth in the Sugar Bowl on November 25; they were also in the mix for the Cotton Bowl, which would have pitted them against the #1 Texas A&amp;M Aggies. But the Rose Bowl committee did not extend official invitations until December 10, 1939.\nTennessee.\nIn the regular season, Tennessee shut out all ten opponents. Led by two All-American guards, Ed Molinski and Bob Suffridge, the Volunteers were forced to play without their star tailback George Cafego, who fell victim to a knee injury against The Citadel on November 11. After a 7–0 win over Auburn on December 9, Tennessee officially was extended an invitation to the Rose Bowl.\nUSC.\nThe Trojans opened the season against Oregon, tying the Ducks 7–7, then scored three straight shutouts, becoming ranked #8 following the second, a 26–0 win over Illinois. A November 4 game featured #7 USC defeating #11 Oregon State 19–7. At Notre Dame on November 25, #4 USC defeated the #7 Irish 20–12. A win over Washington by scoring in the last 1:15 set up the very first epic UCLA–USC rivalry matchup.\nKenny Washington, Woody Strode, Jackie Robinson, and Ray Bartlett starred on the Bruins, in which African Americans made up three of the four backfield players. This was a rarity to have so many African Americans when only a few dozen at all played on college football teams. The ninth-ranked Bruins also were also undefeated, with three ties. This was the first UCLA–USC rivalry football game with national implications, as it was the first with the Rose Bowl on the line for both.\nThe attendance of 103,303 was the second largest college football crowd ever in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. UCLA attempted a pass on fourth down, instead of kicking a field goal. Bobby Robertson of USC knocked down Ned Matthews’ four-yard pass in the end zone with less than five minutes to play to preserve the scoreless tie. The Pacific Coast Conference voted to have USC, with a 7–0–2 record play in the Rose Bowl instead of UCLA with a 6–0–4 record. Art Cohn, sports editor of the \"Oakland Tribune\" implied that race may have been a factor in the decision, since teams from the south refused to play against African Americans. After the regular season, the Trojans were named national champions.\nGame summary.\nTrojan backs Granny Lansdell and Ambrose Schindler rushed for 51 and 81 yards respectively, for a team total of 229 yards rushing. Schindler scored one touchdown and passed to Al Krueger — the hero from the previous year — for the other. Head coach Howard Jones earned his second straight Rose Bowl victory, and his fifth in as many appearances.\nAftermath.\nUSC head coach Jones died less than two years later, in the summer of 1941. Joe Shell, the captain of the Trojans who became an oil company owner and a state assemblyman, died on April 8, 2008.\nUSC bases its 1939 national championship claim on winning the Dickinson System, a formula devised by a University of Illinois professor which awarded the only championship trophy between 1926 and 1940. In 1939, Dickinson was the only poll or system to rank the Trojans number one. USC's stance, however, is in keeping with that of most other schools which won the Dickinson title; only Notre Dame, which won the Dickinson crown in 1938, does not claim a major national title for that year. Since at least 1969, USC had not listed 1939 as a national championship year; but in 2004, USC once again began recognizing the 1939 team as national champions after it determined that it qualified.\nAmbrose \"Amblin' Amby\" Schindler went on to be the MVP in the 1940 College All-Star Game in Chicago in late August. He was inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions Breitbard Hall of Fame in 1973. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2002.\nTennessee player Bill Barnes was later the head coach of the UCLA Bruins and led them to the 1962 Rose Bowl."

He spent six seasons in their minor league system before debuting with the Yankees as a September call-up in 1967. He went one for three in his major league debut against the California Angels in the second game of a doubleheader on September 12.\nFernández backed up Jake Gibbs for 1968 and 1969. Upon former first round draft pick Thurman Munson's arrival in the major leagues, the Yankees dealt Fernández to the Oakland Athletics with Al Downing for Danny Cater and Ossie Chavarria prior to the start of the 1970 season.\nDuring the 1971 season, the A's traded Fernández to the Washington Senators with Paul Lindblad and Don Mincher for Mike Epstein and Darold Knowles. A little over a month later, he was purchased back by the A's, only to be dealt away again during the 1971 season—this time to the Chicago Cubs for Adrian Garrett.\nFernández made three pinch hitting appearances with the Cubs in 1972, but spent most of his time with their triple A affiliate, the Wichita Aeros before being reacquired by the Yankees in a minor league deal. He also spent time in Oakland's and the Detroit Tigers' farm system before retiring.\nFernández holds the record for the most home runs (39) for a player with a batting average less than .200, as well as having the most career walks than hits by a non-pitcher with over 100 at-bats, with 164 walks and 145 hits.\nFernández was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame in 2000."

        "text": "Bournemouth Rowing Club, formerly known as Westover and Bournemouth Rowing Club, was founded in 1865 and is the oldest club in Bournemouth. It competes in coastal rowing regattas organised by the Hants and Dorset Amateur Rowing Association on the South Coast of England. The club used to be located next to the Central Pier on the West Beach, but was evicted by Bournemouth Borough Council to make way for redevelopment. The club now operates out of a shared boathouse on the river Stour at Iford.\nHistory.\n1865 The first lease, a piece of Foreshore 20 feet square was given by the Clerk to the Bournemouth Improvement Commissioners in 1865. A boathouse was erected and rented at £1 per year, mainly for the storage of pleasure boats. There were less than 4000 residents in Bournemouth so a competitive rowing club within the real meaning of the word had not yet started.\nAt the Annual Dinner of 1870 Cutler, the Captain of the Club referred to having two heavy Punts of unequal size and that racing was hardly practical even with a handicap. Sir Henry Drummond Wolff who was then the Parliamentary candidate for Christchurch and Bournemouth presented the club with a four oared racing galley called the \"Lothair\", which was the title of a novel by the Earl of Beaconsfield. This gift set an example, followed for many years by the Parliamentary candidate, to present a racing galley to the local club. These boats were usually built by Picket or some other expert at Southampton, and though quite light, were designed for sea rowing and so much stouter than 'fine' boats used at river Regattas such as the Henley Royal Regatta.\n1871 However, only one racing galley was not sufficient so a public subscription was raised to purchase a second, called the \"Adelaide\". Cutler boasted that he had six men in the club that he would not be ashamed to put into a six-oared galley against any club in England. The first recorded season of races took place in on 1 May 1871 between the Lothair (crewed by Single men) and the Adelaide (crewed by Married men); the Singles won.\nThe Premier Rowing Club was formed in 1871 and were the proud owners of the galley Alice. Bournemouth had just purchased the Test so the challenge was out - a £20 stake placed for a four-mile race to be rowed before the end of June. Bournemouth placed their faith on their own muscles and their new galley the Alice against the impudent youngsters in the test. The old Club's colours were Dark Blue and the Premier Club sported Blue and Magenta. The great day was 22 June and it was raining hard with a chop, so the race was postponed by the umpire until the 29th. The race was a walkover for Bournemouth who won in 6 minutes and thus extinguished for the moment the vaunting ambition of their rivals."

        "title": "Cataraqui Golf and Country Club",
        "text": "Cataraqui Golf and Country Club is a private golf and curling club located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1917.\nHistory.\nEarly golf in Kingston, the Kingston Golf Club.\nCataraqui G&amp;CC was established in 1917. Its founding arose from development pressures in downtown Kingston. The new club was built on land that was then on the western edge of settlement for the city and district, following the World War I-era construction of the LaSalle Causeway and provincial highway, across the Cataraqui River as it feeds into Lake Ontario, in downtown Kingston.\nThis new highway also crossed the property used by the Kingston Golf Club, disrupting the flow of play there. Kingston had been a military centre since its founding as Fort Frontenac by French explorers in 1673, on the site of an aboriginal settlement known as Cataraqui, and the military base was being expanded to large extent, with the world war, necessitating the causeway and highway construction. The Kingston Golf Club, located on the Barriefield Common, just north of the Royal Military College of Canada and Fort Henry, just west of the village of Barriefield, and just east of the Cataraqui River, was the first golf course in the area. The Kingston Golf Club operated from 1886 to 1887, and then again from 1891 to 1925, eventually with 13 distinct holes, and was a charter 1895 member of the Royal Canadian Golf Association. The Kingston Golf Club has been identified as the fourth oldest golf club in North America. The first Canadian Amateur Championship winner in 1895, Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter and stevedore, employed on the dockyards at RMC, represented the Kingston Golf Club. The Kingston Golf Club operated until 1925, with a modified layout, but the area's golfers gradually switched to Cataraqui in the years prior to 1925.\nEarly years of Cataraqui G&amp;CC.\nThe original course at Cataraqui was located past the western edge of the city at that time, on Lake Ontario. It had six holes; the club gradually acquired more land and expanded to 13 holes by 1921; by June 1925 the course had 18 holes. One of the original designers was likely George Cumming, a top Toronto golf professional, Canadian Open and Canadian PGA Championship winner, and golf course architect, who is a member of the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame. Nine different course routings, using different sections of land, were used from 1917 to 1932.\nThompson redesigns the course, 1931-33.\nIn 1931, Stanley Thompson, already a world-famous golf course architect, was hired to redesign the course. The club was selling some land (and losing several holes, to facilitate the construction of grain elevators and other development) near Lake Ontario, while acquiring new land, the former Gravelle Farm, to the north and west of its holdings. The western boundary became the marshlands around the Little Cataraqui Creek. Thompson used the new, much larger property to design and build several new holes, including most of the present back nine. He kept several of the existing holes, and reshaped several others. Thompson had left Kingston before the new course was completed; his work was finished by the club's professional, Richard H. (Dick) Green, likely assisted by Thompson's employee C. E. (Robbie) Robinson, an apprentice golf course architect. The new course, opened in May 1933, drew acclaim from the beginning.\nCataraqui began hosting important events soon after its redesign, and was ranked #57 on the list of Canada's top courses in 2006 by Scoregolf magazine. The 15th hole, a very challenging 206-yard uphill par 3, christened 'Plateau', has often been ranked among the top holes in Canada. The routing plan from Thompson's 1931 redesign has remained intact.\n1973 clubhouse fire.\nThe original clubhouse, opened in 1922, burned to the ground on August 16, 1973, destroying virtually all of the club's archives and many of its trophies, but with no loss of life. A photo of the fire was published in many newspapers around the world.\nCanadian golf course architect Doug Carrick has been consulting to the Club for the past dozen years. Carrick's work has seen the bunkers completely refurbished, and several new fairway bunkers added, notably on holes 5, 9, 10, 16, and 17, tightening the driving zones. From the back tees, with new tees having been constructed on holes 4, 10, 13 and 16, the course currently plays to a maximum length of nearly 6,600 yards, par 70. Cataraqui celebrated its centennial in 2017, and successfully hosted the 2017 Canadian Junior Boys' Championship, from July 31 to August 3.\nGolf: tournaments, champions, and notable players.\nCataraqui has been a frequent host site for national, provincial and major local events, including the Ontario Amateur Championship (1939, 1952, 1963); the Ontario Ladies' Amateur Championship (1937, 1965, 1977, 1996); the Ontario Open (1955, 1958, 1966, 1973, 1979); the Canadian PGA Championship (1936, 1938); the Canadian PGA Seniors Championship in 1997; the Ontario Junior Match Play Championship in 2009; the Ontario University Athletics championship on several occasions, including 2011; and the 2017 Canadian Junior Boys Championship. Major annual local events include the elite \"Kingston Whig-Standard\" men's tournament, and the elite Eastern Provinces women's tournament. Notable champions from events staged at Cataraqui have included Sandy Somerville, Marlene Streit, Moe Norman, Warren Sye, Jerry Anderson, and Brooke Henderson.\nNotable golfers from the club include Richard H. (Dick) Green, the club's professional for nearly 40 years, who assisted Stanley Thompson with the 1931-33 redesign; Mark Siemonsen (1974 Ontario Juvenile champion and 1977 Ontario University champion); local legend Ronald G. Brown; 1981 Ontario Junior champion Barry Wood; Canadian Professional Golf Tour event champion John Colwell; 2002 Willingdon Cup players Craig Revell and Jeff Crowe; two-time Ontario Junior champion Brad Revell; Ontario University Athletics women's champion (2006 and 2008) Danielle Green; 2011 Ontario Women's Mid-Amateur champion Patti Hogeboom; and Canadian Professional Golf Tour event champion Matt McQuillan. McQuillan, who earned PGA Tour playing privileges in December 2010 for the 2011 season, and who was also a PGA Tour member in 2012, set a new competitive course record of 62 in a Pro-Am tournament in July 2008, breaking the mark set in 2003 by Chris Barber (a former Cataraqui member and several times Ottawa Zone CPGA champion) by one stroke. McQuillan's achievement was celebrated by the Club on December 21, 2010; he received an honorary membership; he split the 2012 season between the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour. Current Cataraqui Club professionals include Canadian former Tour players Malcolm Trickey and Kevin Dickey, and 1998 Ontario Ladies' Amateur champion Kristen MacLaren.\nCurling.\nThe club's curling program was begun in 1961, with six sheets of ice installed in an addition to the clubhouse. With the arrival of curling, the club became a year-round operation. Curling was retained in 1975 with the opening of the new clubhouse, again with six sheets of ice.\nProvincial curling champions.\nNotable curlers include Ted Brown, third on the Ontario Tankard champion (Dr. Alex Scott, skip) rink 1975-76, and also skip of the Ontario Mixed champion rink that same year."

        "title": "The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book",
        "text": "The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book is a book written by Brendan C. Boyd and Fred C. Harris about baseball cards, primarily ones issued during the authors' youth in 1950s, and the players on the cards.\nThe book was published by Little, Brown &amp; Co. in October 1973, two years after Roger Kahn's \"The Boys of Summer\" sparked nostalgia for 1950s baseball. \nAfter several years of being out of print, Seamhead Books reprinted the book in April 2015, with some new contents.\nAuthors.\nNeither Boyd nor Harris had published a book nor possessed any special expertise in the field of sports or sports memorabilia when they decided to write \"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book\". In 1970, while working at a Boston bookstore, a customer inquired about books on baseball cards. Surprised to learn that there weren't any books on the subject, Harris told Boyd, \"we should write one.\" So they pored over the cards they had collected in their youth and wrote \"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book\". Although the book doesn't indicate which author contributed which parts, generally Boyd (from Boston) covered American League players and Harris (from Philadelphia) covered National League players. In the introduction to the 1991 edition, Boyd writes that several publishers declined to publish it: \"an editor at McGraw Hill turned it down as 'too flip.' (Get it?baseball cards? Flip?) We weren't just getting rejections now, we were getting cute rejections.\" \n\"Then Roger Kahn intervened (inadvertently, I'm sure.) He wrote \"The Boys of Summer\". It quickly became a bestseller. We submitted our proposal to Little, Brown, detailing the resemblances between Kahn's book and ours. 'Baseball nostalgia is the next big thing,' we lobbied shamelessly.\"\nBrendan C. Boyd wrote another book, published in 1993, titled \"Blue Ruin: A Novel of the 1919 World Series\". Fred C. Harris owns the Great American Baseball Company.\nSubject matter.\n\"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book\", presents a humorous and usually irreverent account of the baseball cards that were distributed during the authors' youths and of the players depicted on the cards. The basic format consists of an image of a card of a player, or in a few instances a manager or umpire, accompanied by a short characterization of the card and the player. The commentary for each card ranges from a single sentence to a few hundred words. Unlike most sports-related books, the vast majority of players featured in this book possessed mediocre talent and had been largely forgotten by 1973.\nThe book is not a baseball card guide in any respect and makes no pretense of being one—there's no indication what a card is worth or even that it has any intrinsic value other than the memories it invokes. Baseball card collecting in 1973 was primarily a childhood activity and usually abandoned by young adulthood. The authors' stated assumption is that the cards one collected in his youth are all gone, as revealed in the book's closing comments, \"We know, your mother, your own mother, threw them away.\" Instead, the authors present a nostalgic look at the part of their youth that involved collecting, trading, and flipping baseball cards.\nSections.\nThe book is divided into four sections:\nThe first section reminisces in a rapid-fire stream of consciousness flow about growing up and eventually coming of age in 1950s suburban America with Pez, cap-guns, Jujubes, and baseball cards. The second delves into the Topps trading card company and its pioneering executive Sy Berger circa 1973. \"There was Topps and then there was Topps,\" Harris says in the introduction to the 1991 reissue.\nThe bulk and the heart of the book is the section called \"Profiles,\" containing the card images and player biographies. Usually one or two players are featured per page and the biography is by no means meant to be complete or unbiased, but rather a quick snapshot of what the authors remembered most about the player. n all there are 221 baseball players featured with no stated or apparent reason for their selection, although it can be gathered that many were picked for the humorous potential in some aspect of the player or the card itself. Most of the cards were issued from 1951 to 1963 with a few later ones included.\nThe last section of the book offers a short discourse on things to do with cards, from hoarding, trading, to finally collecting. The ending foreshadows the adult hobby of collecting baseball cards that was about to explode, although it is unlikely the authors predicted this.\nThemes and threads.\nThe book is not written in a linear fashion. Each card and its accompanying commentary, with a few rare exceptions, stand alone and are not categorized, such as by team, league, era, position, etc. The ultimate effect of the seemingly scattershot arrangement is that the reader can start most anywhere and jump about without any loss of comprehension. That said, there are unstated themes that run through the book, or they could be described as threads that hold the story together.\nStar players vs. journeymen players.\nUnlike most every other sports book, and specifically those covering baseball players of the 1950s and early 1960s, \"The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book\" does not focus on the stars and legends of the game but rather on the lesser and forgotten players. Probably more than anything else this is what defines the book and gives it a unique perspective.\nThe great players, however, are not ignored; in fact, of the 221 presented, 15 are in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Among the stars mentioned are Sandy Koufax (seen on his rookie card which is dubbed his “Bar Mitzvah picture” because he looks so young), Ernie Banks (remembered for having played on bad teams and being loved by everyone), Stan Musial (because of the unsolved mystery of why there was no card of him in 1950 and 1951) and Yogi Berra (because he's Yogi Berra). Those who didn’t get mentioned include Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn, Harmon Killebrew, Frank Robinson, Whitey Ford, and Roger Maris. Mickey Mantle is mentioned, but not only is his card not shown, it’s belittled for having been so abundant one year.\nForgotten players.\nIt can be said that the book \"is about players who have long since been forgotten by everybody but those who grew up collecting their cards and thinking them important simply because they were Major League ballplayers. The primary reason many of these players have been forgotten is because they weren’t very good, and that is how Boyd and Harris have remembered them: Some because they couldn’t field well, such as Dick Stuart and Marv Throneberry, quite a few, including Doug Camilli and Eddie Miksis, because they couldn’t hit, or Casey Wise, who \"really\" couldn't hit; and of course those who couldn’t pitch, like Dave DeBusschere and Eli Grba (of whom the authors report, \"In addition to having the hardest name to pronounce in the big leagues he also had just about the worst stuff.\")\nPlayers with funny names.\nSeveral players are recalled because they had confusing or unusual names: Wayne Terwilliger, Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar Tuskahoma McLish, Coot Veal, \"Cot\" Deal, Whammy Douglas, and Foster Castleman. The book has this to say about Foster Castleman, “Of course a ballplayer with a name like this is never going to amount to anything. If you have a name like an orthodontist you’re going to play like an orthodontist. The guy never really had a shot.” One item amusing to the authors was the player named Boyd Gail Harris, whose full name coincidentally matches the two authors' last names plus one of the authors' wife's name.\nEntries about the card.\nA good many of the capsules in the profiles section are more about the baseball card itself than the player depicted. In some the authors remark about the prevalence or difficulty in obtaining the card: \"Toby Atwell has to be remembered by any serious collector of baseball cards in 1952 as having been one of the most difficult cards to acquire,\" the authors write. \"The career of Toby Atwell as player was secondary to the career of Toby Atwell as baseball card, and if you needed him to complete your set too, you'll know what I mean.\" In many others, Harris and Boyd point out some absurdity, such as slipshod graphics, an absurd remark about the player, or the player's silly pose or expression. One example is Bob Cerv's 1958 Topps card, where it looks as if he's whacking himself in the head with his bat. Another card fitting this category is that of pitcher Harvey Haddix, who is best remembered for once having pitched 12 innings of perfect baseball only to lose the game in the 13th inning after allowing one hit. He is shown with a forlorn smile. The bio tells us that it “is the reluctantly self-deprecating smile of the perennially dumped-on, the wry smile of the universal victim, the man who expects very little of his peers and knows secretly that he’s going to have to settle for quite a good deal less.”\nStyle.\nMuch of the book's humor and thus its appeal derives from the authors' style. Although there are notable exceptions, for the most part the overt writing style could be characterized as breezy, goofy, and irreverent, at times to the point of being ridiculing. Somewhat curiously though, perhaps because of the reader's awareness of the authors' respect for the game and the inherent difficulty of playing it at the major league level, the ultimate effect is to glorify the effort made by the humdrum player because he was part of game that was a significant part of one’s youth. The following two quotes from the book are representative of the style used in the \"Profiles\" section:\nQuick, name a major league baseball player who was born in San Remo, Italy, lived in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and couldn't hit. That's right--Reno Bertoia.\nOK. Name another one.\nThe back of Reno's card is interesting. It says that his average last year was .162 and that, although he did not get to play in too many ballgames, he gained valuable information about American League hurlers that would help him in the future. I suspect that the information he gathered was that every pitcher in the American League could get him out, and that perhaps he should try another line of work.\nNow, it is not necessary for me to declare that Hector Lopez was the worst fielding third baseman in the history of baseball. Everyone knows that. It is more or less a matter of public record. But I do feel called upon somehow to try to indicate, if only for the historical archivists among us, the sheer depths of his innovative barbarousness. Hector Lopez was a butcher. Pure and Simple. A butcher. His range was about one step to either side, his hands seemed to be made of concrete and his defensive attitude was so cavalier and arbitrary as to hardly constitute an attitude at all. Hector did not simply field a groundball, he attacked it. Like a farmer trying to kill a snake with a stick. And his mishandling of routine infield flies was the sort of which legends are made. Hector Lopez was not just a bad fielder for a third baseman. In fact, Hector Lopez was not just a bad fielder for a baseball player. Hector Lopez was, when every factor has been taken into consideration, a bad fielder for a human being. The stands are full of obnoxious leather-lunged cretins who insist they can play better than most major leaguers. Well, in Hector's case they could have been right. I would like to go on record right here and now as declaring Hector Lopez the all-time worst fielding major league ballplayer. That's quite a responsibility there, Hector, but I have every confidence you'll be able to live up to it.\nThere are a few notable exceptions to the satirical style, in which straightforward reverence is paid, usually to the game's greats. The card for Ted Williams says simply, \"In 1955, there were 77,263,127 male American human beings. And every one of them in his heart of hearts would have given two arms, a leg and his collection of Davy Crockett iron-ons to be Teddy Ballgame.\"\nThe commentary accompanying Satchel Paige's card lists Mr. Paige's oft-quoted \"Rules for Staying Young\" and concludes with the authors' own prophetic pronouncement: \"Satchel Paige could have been the greatest pitcher in major league history, if he'd been given the chance. Don't look back, America, something might be gaining on you.\"\nAnd the cards of Jackie Robinson and Roberto Clemente, in honor of their notable off-field heroics and recent deaths, are each posted on a black background with no comment at all.\nReviews, citations and legacy.\nAlthough the book was never a bestseller and spent much more time out-of-print than in print since its publication (and then reprint edition in 2015), it has nonetheless attained a cult following and been frequently cited by many publications and online resources. It is excerpted in \"Baseball: A Literary Anthology\", where Nicholas Dawidoff calls it \"baseball writing's answer to free jazz. The book consists of a series of reproductions of 1950's baseball cards and the authors' annotations—spirited riffs on matters ranging from Smoky Burgess's heft, to Don Mossi's ears, to Vern Stephens' pop flies.\"\nPerhaps the book's most lasting legacy is the contribution it made, albeit unwittingly, to the adult hobby of card collecting. Harris and Boyd, like many other boys who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, collected cards as youths, lost interest in the hobby in their teens, and rekindled the hobby in as adults. Harris and Boyd wrote a book about baseball cards because at the time there were no books about baseball cards."

The course record of 62 was recorded on 8 August 1997, by professional golfer Graeme Storm, the 1999 British Amateur Champion, who learned the game there.\nHistory.\nThe course began as a rough, 9-hole course at Hart Old Village, where the land was rented from W Purves for £10 per year. Mr. Purves was the club's first Captain and John Gardner was its first President. The Gardner Cup is still one of the club's major trophies.\nIn 1907 the club moved to its current location at Hart Warren, where a grassed railway embankment conceals the course from the rest of the town. The annual subscription was £1, with an entrance fee of £1. Today's amounts are £565 annual membership fees and approx £450 one off entrance fee respectively. Green fees are around £38 midweek - £45 weekends per person, however if playing with a current member it is £20 midweek and £25 weekend."

It was released as a WiiWare launch title in Japan on March 25, 2008, and on May 26, 2008 in North America at a cost of 500 Wii Points. In the PAL regions, it was released on March 13, 2009 at a cost of 800 Wii Points.\nGameplay.\n\"Family Table Tennis\" is a simplified table tennis simulation with the player controlling a member of a family, consisting of a mother, father, pre-teen son (Billy) and daughter (Sarah), against another in a game of table tennis. Similar to \"Wii Sports\" tennis, the movement of the character on screen is controlled by the computer, with the player swinging the Wii Remote like a paddle to serve and return the ball. The player can choose from four courts to play on, including a beach, a forest area, an amusement park, and a more traditional tournament hall.\nThree minigames are also available outside the main game, including a rally mode where points are scored according to the number of returns in the current rally, a target mode where the player must aim the ball at certain points on the table, and a game where you must hit specific types of fruit.\nReception.\nIGN was not impressed with the game, giving it a 2.5 out of 10 and citing ugly graphics with \"heinous\" character designs, a constrained presentation and \"boring and shallow\" gameplay. It fared slightly better with Nintendo Life, which thought the game's simplicity makes it suitable for younger children, but is otherwise lacking substance for the average gamer.\nHowever, \"Wired\"'s Chris Kohler thought it offered the best value of the Japanese WiiWare launch titles, calling it a \"standout\" while also taking into consideration the low price. The only person to verifiably beat the game on its hardest level to date is Brian Lovejoy Phillips."

        "text": "The Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club, often referred to as Ottawa Hunt or the Hunt Club, is a private golf and curling club in Canada, located in Ottawa, Ontario. Founded in 1908 as a hunting club, it has hosted many world-class professional and amateur golf tournaments, along with many high-profile Canadian curling events.\nHistory.\nWith golf entering into a boom period after World War I, with enormous demand for new facilities, the Ottawa Hunt Club expanded into golf in 1919. Its South and West nines, usually paired together as its main tournament course, were designed by Willie Park, Jnr. (1864−1925), a two-time British Open champion (1887, 1889), one of the era's top golf architects, and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.\nIts curling facility was opened in 1959, and has six sheets of ice.\nJournalist Eddie MacCabe wrote a history book for the 75th anniversary of the club, published in 1983.\nRedesign history.\nThe golf course was redesigned, mainly for its green complexes, by Tom McBroom in 1989. The club's latest renovation, with a primary aim to implement more expansive practice facilities, was performed by Dr. Michael Hurdzan in 2013; this work reduced the par from 72 to 71, as one par-four hole was replaced by a new par-three hole.\nImportant tournaments hosted.\nMen's events.\nThe Club hosted the Canadian Open in 1932; this tournament was won by World Golf Hall of Famer Harry Cooper.\nOttawa Hunt hosted the Americas Cup golf matches in 1960; this event (which ended after 1967) saw the United States, Canada, and Mexico compete in amateur team play. The American team was led by future World Golf Hall of Fame members Jack Nicklaus and Deane Beman, yet defeated Canada only narrowly, by 21.5 to 20, with Mexico trailing in third place.\nIt hosted the Canadian Amateur Championship in 1937; this event was won by Canadian Golf Hall of Fame member Ross Somerville, for his last of six titles. It hosted the Canadian Amateur Championship in 1960; this event was won by Canadian Golf Hall of Fame member Keith Alexander. It hosted the Canadian Amateur Championship in 1970; this event was won by Allen Miller, who turned professional shortly afterwards, and went on to win on the PGA Tour.\nWomen's events.\nThe club hosted the 1994 du Maurier Classic, then a major championship, on the LPGA Tour, won by Martha Nause with a score of 279 (nine under par) for four rounds.\nIt hosted the LPGA Tour's CN Canadian Women's Open in August 2008, celebrating the club's centennial. Katherine Hull won with a score of 277 (−11), one stroke ahead of runner-up Se Ri Pak, with Yani Tseng a further stroke back in third place; Tseng set a new ladies' competitive course record with 64 (–8) in round two, spread over two days due to weather. The 2008 edition of the tournament set new attendance records, with more than 70,000 fans, and raised more than C$1 million for charity.\nIn 2017, the club hosted the CP Canadian Women's Open, which was won by Sung Hyun Park, who had earlier won the 2017 U.S. Women's Open. Canadian superstar Brooke Henderson, who grew up in Smiths Falls, Ontario, less than an hour's drive from Ottawa Hunt, set a ladies' record for the newly redesigned course with a third-round 63, eight under the revised par of 71. Henderson is an honorary member of the Ottawa Hunt Club.\nThe scoring record would last until the 2022 Canadian Women's Open as Paula Reto would break the course and tournament record shooting a 62 in the opening round. She would go on to win the tournament to mark her 1st LPGA Tour victory."

        "text": "The UMass Minutemen basketball team represents the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Amherst, Massachusetts, in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. They play their home games in the William D. Mullins Memorial Center. The Minutemen currently compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Beginning in the 2025–26 season, the team will play as a member of the Mid-American Conference.\nHistory.\nThe men's basketball program has a history of over 100 years. The Minutemen, as they have been called since 1972, celebrated their 100th season in 2008–09. Though the program's first game was played on January 10, 1900, there were several years in which no team was assembled.\nThe program's first coach was Harold M. Gore, who in 11 seasons compiled a record of 85–53 (.616 win percentage), highlighted by a 12–2 season in 1925–26. In 1933–34, Massachusetts was the only undefeated team in men's college basketball, going 12–0. For the 1948–49 season, Massachusetts joined the Yankee Conference to mark the first time they participated in conference play. UMass would go on to be 10-time champions of the Yankee Conference.\nThe 1960s and 1970s were prosperous for the program. The 1961–62 team went 15–9 and participated in the NCAA tournament for the first time in program history. They would go on to win 4 Yankee Conference titles in the 1960s, and played in the NIT at the end of the 1969–70 season. Though not a nationally recognized name, the program's coach with the most wins was Jack Leaman. Leaman guided Massachusetts to 217 wins, and coached players including Julius Erving, Al Skinner, Rick Pitino and Tom McLaughlin. The program compiled a record of 142–103 (.580) in the 1960s. The 1969–70 team featured Julius Erving. In his first game with the varsity team, a 90–85 win over Providence College, Erving scored 27 points and grabbed 28 rebounds.\nIn the first eight seasons of the 1970s, the Redmen/Minutemen compiled a record of 152–65 (.700). They won 5 Yankee Conference titles, and played in 5 NITs (the Yankee Conference did not have an NCAA tournament automatic bid). The early 1970s teams featured players such as Erving, Al Skinner, and Rick Pitino. Jack Leaman, who coached the team for 13 seasons, hung it up after the 1978–79 season, with a record of 217–126 (.632). Though Leaman's last season as coach of the men's team was 1978–79, he remained a key part of the UMass Athletic Department until he died in 2004.\nJohn Calipari era 1988–1996.\nThe Minutemen fell on hard times in the late 1970s and 1980s, but would rebound under the direction of rookie coach John Calipari, perhaps the school's most recognizable coach, who took the head coaching job in 1988. Calipari took over a program that was on a streak of 10-straight losing seasons and had not been to the NCAA tournament since 1962. Calipari led UMass to the NIT in his second season as head coach. In his fourth season, UMass won both the A-10 regular season and tournament championships. Over the next few seasons, Calipari took the team to new heights and frequent #1 rankings in the AP weekly poll. In 1996, the Minutemen reached the Final Four for the first time. After the 1995–96 season, Calipari left UMass for the NBA as the new head coach of the New Jersey Nets. The 1990s were the defining decade for UMass basketball. Calipari helped the Minutemen become A-10 Tournament Champs five consecutive times (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996), and appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times, including two appearances in the Elite Eight (1995, 1996) and a Final Four appearance (1996), the only appearance ever for the Minutemen. However, NCAA sanctions stripped the Minutemen of their 1996 NCAA tournament victories. The sanctions, based on star Marcus Camby admitting he took money, clothes, and jewelry from an agent during the season, removed the Final Four from the record books. Additionally, 45% of tournament revenue had to be returned to the NCAA. Camby reimbursed the school for the $151,617 in lost revenue.\nAfter Calipari resigned in 1996, his associate Bruiser Flint coached from 1996–2001, and Steve Lappas coached from 2001–2005.\nTravis Ford era 2005–2008.\nIn 2005, Travis Ford replaced Lappas. Though the Minutemen struggled with a 13–15 record in Ford's first season of 2005–06, he quickly improved the team in the next two seasons. In 2006–07, the Minutemen were co-champions of the Atlantic 10 (along with Xavier), reached the second round of the NIT, and finished with a record of 24–9. In 2007–08, the Minutemen reached the NIT championship game where they lost to Ohio State 92–85 and finished with a record of 25–11. Following the 2007–08 season, his third with the Minutemen, he left to take the head coaching vacancy at Oklahoma State.\nDerek Kellogg era 2008–2017.\nOn April 23, 2008, former Minutemen player Derek Kellogg returned to Amherst and became the 21st coach of the program. In 2011–12 the Minutemen appeared in the NIT after a successful season with a 22–11 record, reaching the semifinals, where they lost to Stanford. The Minutemen were again invited to the NIT in following the 2012–13.\nThe 2013–14 season was a success as the Minutemen qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time in 16 years. The team started off the season 10–0 and then 16–1, while reaching as high as #13 in the AP poll, and #12 in the Coaches poll. However, the Minutemen, a #6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, were defeated in their first game against #11 seeded Tennessee.\nIn the 2014–15 season, the Minutemen regressed, finishing with a 17–15 overall record, and an eighth place finish in conference. The team also had sub-.500 seasons in each of the next two, and Kellogg was fired on March 9, 2017.\nMatt McCall era 2017–2022.\nShortly after Kellogg was fired, the school announced that Winthrop head coach Pat Kelsey had been hired as the new head coach at UMass. However, shortly before the press conference to announce his hiring, Kelsey announced he would not accept the position. On March 31, the school announced they had hired Chattanooga head coach Matt McCall. \nMcCall's five-year tenure at the school was not successful, and he was fired just before the end of the 2022 season. His overall record at UMass finished at 61-82, and the team failed to advance past the conference tournament's quarterfinal round in each of the five seasons.\nFrank Martin era 2022–present.\nUMass announced it had hired former University of South Carolina head coach Frank Martin on March 25, 2022. In Martin's first season at the helm, the Minutemen finished 15-16 with a 6-12 mark in conference play, but the team improved in his second, finishing with a 20-11 overall record, and a fourth place conference finish at 11-7.\nRivalries.\nThrough 2024, Massachusetts and the Rhode Island Rams have played over 160 times, and at least once a year every year since 1950. The Atlantic 10 regularly pairs UMass and URI in a home-and-home series each season.\nStarting in 1995, Massachusetts and Boston College played annually for the Commonwealth Cup, in the \"Commonwealth Classic\". Following the 2011–2012 season (in which UMass defeated the Eagles 82–46 in Chestnut Hill), Boston College discontinued the series in part due to changes to the ACC conference schedule and canceled their return trip to Amherst in late 2012.\nUMass and Temple had an intense rivalry in the 1990s, during which time the schools were coached by John Calipari and John Chaney. The two coaches had to be restrained from each other during a 3-overtime game in 1990. After a game in 1994, Chaney charged at Calipari during a post-game press conference, and in front of reporters and television cameras, threatened to kill Calipari.\nFrom 1996 to 2005, Massachusetts and Connecticut played in the \"Mass Mutual U-Game\", a reference to the two schools' nicknames, UMass and UConn, respectively. UConn won nine of the ten games. UMass won the 2004 game, in which the Huskies were the defending national champions.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Minutemen have appeared in the NCAA tournament nine times. Their combined record is 11–9.

        "text": "William Wright Regan (January 23, 1899 – June 11, 1968) was an American professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1926 to 1931 for the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nA native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Regan was a World War I veteran who played semi-pro baseball before starting his professional career in 1922. He played for the Kitchener and Flint teams of the Michigan-Ontario League, and later moved on to the Columbus Senators of the American Association. In 1925 hit a .298 batting average for Columbus, and .317 in 38 games in 1926, before joining the Boston Red Sox at midseason to become the team's regular second baseman for the next five years.\nBasically a line drive hitter and smart baserunner, Regan had good contact and was able to convert his gap line drives into extra bases. \nIn 1927 he recorded career-numbers with 37 doubles and 10 triples, while hitting .274 in 129 games. \nHis most productive season came in 1928, when he posted career-highs with seven home runs and 75 RBI, while collecting 30 doubles and six triples. On June 16 of that year, he came to bat twice in an inning and homered both times. His second was an inside-the-park homer, as he equaled his HR output of the previous season. Besides this, he was considered in the American League MVP vote in both years.\nIn 1929 Regan hit a career-high .288, while collecting 54 RBI. A year later he was still productive hitting 35 doubles, and 10 triples. He also played with the Pirates in 1931, his last major league season. \nIn a six-year career, Regan was a .267 hitter (632-for-2364) with 18 home runs and 292 RBI in 641 games, including 236 runs, 158 doubles, 36 triples, 38 stolen bases, and a .306 on-base percentage. He made 610 appearances at second base, and committed 138 errors in 3610 chances for a .965 fielding percentage. Eventually, he appeared in 14 games at third base (12), first (1), and right field (1).\nRegan later played in the International League for the Baltimore Orioles, Buffalo Bisons, Montreal Royals and Toronto Maple Leafs, before ending his career in 1935 with the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association. While in Baltimore, he hit a career-high .321.\nFollowing his retirement, Regan worked in the Allegheny County (PA) police department for 20 years and also joined the armed forces during World War II.\nRegan died in his homeland of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 69.\nFact.\nBabe Ruth's last strikeout victim on September 28, 1930. http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1930/B09280BOS1930.htm"

        "text": "The Brigham Young University Men's Rugby Team participates in the Rocky Mountain division of Division 1-A Rugby. They won the D1-A National Championship in 2009 and 2012. From 2013 to 2016 they participated in the Varsity Cup Championship, where they won three championships (2013, 2014, and 2015), defeating rival powerhouse Cal each time.\nBYU Rugby normally hosts its home matches at South Field on BYU campus in Provo, Utah. The stadium now features a grandstand with seating capacity up to 4,200 spectators, with additional standing room for larger crowds.\nBYU Rugby finished the 2019 season ranked 8th nationally, losing in the quarter-finals to Saint Mary's.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Brigham Young University Rugby team was founded by John Seggar in 1962 while a student. In 1967, after graduating from BYU, Seggar became Head Coach of the newly formed program, a position he held on and off for 15 seasons.\nIn the 1980s, players David Smyth, Mark Ormsby, and Dean Ormsby helped build up the BYU Rugby team to compete in national playoffs. However they were never able to advance past the quarterfinal round.\nPost-season absence.\nIn 1987, the National Collegiate Tournament changed the schedule of playing from Friday-Saturday to Saturday-Sunday. This change in schedule and the team's affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints kept them from competing for a national championship because they would not compete on Sundays. The change in the championship format also led Seggar to retire as the head coach.\nOver the next few years, BYU Rugby continued to participate in regular season matches, but they participated in no post-season. David Smyth, Mark Ormsby, and Dean Ormsby acted as co-coaches, but they seemed unable to capture the zeal that Coach Seggar had inspired among his players. While under Smyth, Ormsby, and Ormsby the team never finished above .500. The three passed the program on to Vernon Heperi, the new BYU dean of students, who would later become the head coach.\nAfter a temporary stay in the United Kingdom, Smyth returned to Utah in 1991 and once again assumed coaching responsibilities at BYU. Smyth left for the second time in 2002.\nNational championships.\nIn 2004, USA Rugby returned post-season tournament play to a Friday-Saturday format, and BYU Rugby began playing again in the national tournament.\nUnder Head Coach Jared Akenhead — who took over from Smyth as head coach in 2002 — the BYU Rugby team made it to the national collegiate playoffs. Several of his players received All-American awards and National Team selection honors.\nIn 2005, Akenhead left the BYU Rugby program and Smyth once again assumed head coaching responsibilities, with Kimball Kjar, Wayne Tarawhiti, Brian Westenskow, Justen Nadauld, and Jeff Hullinger as assistant coaches.\nIn his 20+ seasons as head coach at BYU, Smyth has coached several USA National Rugby Team Members, Collegiate All-Americans, and Pacific Coast All-Stars. He has also led the Cougars to five collegiate championships: 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Smyth retired from BYU Rugby at the end of the 2018 season. On August 13, 2018, it was announced Steve St. Pierre would become the new rugby head coach.\nRivalries.\nEach year BYU competes in the Wasatch Cup, an annual rivalry match against the University of Utah. Since 2007 the symbol of victory has been a rather large loving cup style trophy with the match history inscribed in its base.\nAs of 2014 BYU participates in the West Coast Cup. The series features a home-and-home series between BYU and Saint Mary's. The match title comes from the fact that both teams compete in the West Coast Conference in most NCAA sanctioned sports.\nOther matches that BYU participates in annually include the Champions Challenge, featuring BYU against a previous season semi-pro championship team, and the Rugby Bowl.\nWhile not a regular rival on the schedule, BYU and Cal are regarded currently as being the top rugby rivalry in the nation. Since 2006 the Cougars and Bears have met in every season, except 2012, in the collegiate postseason tournament. Cal did not participate in any post-season collegiate rugby in 2012. Before 2006 the schools met in 1981, 1983, 1984, and 2001. 2015 marked the ninth time BYU and Cal have met for the national championship.\nNational championships.\nResults.\nBYU has had several successful seasons, finishing as the top or one of the top teams in the country in post-season tournaments and in national rankings.\nDivision 1-A Rugby.\nThe following table shows the Division 1-A national championships where BYU reached at least the semifinals. In addition to the years listed below, the Cougars made the quarterfinals in 1999, 2018, and 2019 and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in 2004.\nVarsity Cup.\nThe following table is a list of each of the Varsity Cups in which BYU has reached at least the semifinals.\nAwards.\nCollegiate All-Americans.\nHM = Honorable Mention"

        "text": "John Hammond (born July 19, 1954) is an American basketball executive who is the senior advisor to the president of basketball operations of the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Previously, Hammond had been the general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks, as well as the assistant general manager with the Detroit Pistons, where he had also worked as an assistant coach. He had also been an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and Houston Baptist University. He is a graduate of Greenville College. He has a daughter named Lauryn Hammond, who attended Marquette University. He is best known in NBA circles as the general manager who drafted NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Bucks.\nHammond won the 2010 NBA Executive of the Year Award, the first time a Bucks executive had ever won the award in the team's history. Hammond was credited with building a Bucks team that went from 34 to 46 victories in one season, including a return to the playoffs for the first time since 2006. He also was responsible for several moves he made before the 2009–10 season, such as drafting Brandon Jennings and bringing in veteran John Salmons in a trade. Both of them played key roles in the Bucks' 2009–10 season.\nThe Bucks had reached the NBA Playoffs three times during Hammond's seven-year tenure as General Manager, yet had failed to win a playoff series. During one of those three playoff appearances, they had a losing regular season record (38–44) and were swept in the first round, losing each of the four games by an average of 15 points. During Hammond's stewardship the Bucks had posted 240 wins against 318 losses, a winning percentage of .430. The 2013–14 season for the Bucks, the franchise's 46th season, posted a franchise all-time worst record of 15 wins and 67 defeats, a winning percentage of .183, as well as featuring the worst attendance in the NBA. In January 2013, Hammond and Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to a three-year contract extension worth approximately $5.5 million. Kohl later sold the team in May 2014.\nDespite the dismal season in 2013–14, Hammond had also built the foundation for what would become a championship team with the Bucks before that season, by drafting Giannis Antetokounmpo and making a trade with the Detroit Pistons that included future All-Star Khris Middleton. Both Antetokounmpo and Middleton became the cornerstones for the Bucks' NBA Championship team in 2021.\nOn May 23, 2017, it was announced that Hammond would sign a five-year deal to be the new general manager of the Orlando Magic alongside friend Jeff Weltman, thus officially ending his tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks.\nIn the Disney+ film about Giannis Antetokounmpo, \"Rise\", Hammond is portrayed by Taylor Nichols.\nOn July 5, 2023, it was announced that Hammond was promoted to senior advisor to the president of basketball operations."

Syracuse was ranked number one in the nation for most of this year, averaged just under 18 goals a game, and had only one close game—an overtime win over North Carolina—during the regular season. They had also defeated the second seed in the tournament, Johns Hopkins, 19–7 early in the season.\nThis NCAAs is also notable for being the tournament where Gary Gait took his famous \"Air Gait\" shot in a close semi-final game against Tony Seaman's Penn team. Penn played a tough zone defense to try to contain the Gaits and Syracuse. Gary Gait saw a way around the zone, by running directly at the goal from behind and slam dunking the ball into the goal past the shocked goaltender. At that time, a player was allowed to both touch the goal and land in the crease, provided the ball had first crossed the goal line. Gait scored on two \"Air Gait\" plays in that game. The NCAA outlawed that type of play a short while later. Syracuse won this semifinal game against Penn on a goal by Paul Gait with three seconds left in the game.\nIn a 23–5 quarterfinal win over Navy, Gary Gait scored a tournament record 9 goals."

It competes in the Mid Atlantic Rugby Conference.\nHistory.\nThe Norsemen were chartered and founded as a club at the University of Scranton in 1985. The predecessor team was the \"Scranton Stouts\" started by two University of South Carolina students, Kevin Podlaski and Doug Morgan in 1981. The Norsemen enjoyed success through the 1990s and developed a reputation as a tough and physical team.\nIn 1999, due to off-field incidents and parental complaints, the Scranton Rugby team was stripped of its privilege to wear the school color –purple– and changed their uniform color to forest green. \nThe team originated from students but was not \"officially\" affiliated with the school until it joined the EPRU in 1988–89, as the affiliation with a school was required even for NCAA club sports and it was the only way they could schedule games against other colleges. The colors were green and black, reverse quarters. \nAs Division II probationary status in 1988 the team had a successful sean, winning the EPRU Division II therefore they earned the right to move up to Division I. The early 1990s proved to be a rather successful period for the team. Turning out almost 100 players each season.\nNorsemen's most successful season was in the Spring of 1991, when finished the season with a 11-2-1 record. The 2 losses both occurred at an invitational tournament (Cherry Blossom) to eventual winner Maryland Terrapins by 4 points and to the Navy Midshipmen, losing a halftime lead to fall by 6 in the Plate Final –Navy won the tourney the following year. The tie was against PCOM, who at the time had not lost a match to a college or men's club in over two years.\nPlayers achieved Select Side Status, All-American honors and many continued to play both domestically and internationally at the highest levels - Men's Club Div I National Champions, as well as national representative sides at venues such as the Hong Kong 7s, Dubai 7s, Wellington 7's, and other competitions.\nRecords &amp; Highlights.\nThe Norsemen went to their first playoff game in the fall of 1996, (see above - 1989 Fall defeated Millersville 27-18 in Harrisburg, PA) competing in Men's College Division I. Former team captain Robert P. Meuser went on to play with USA Division I team Long Island RFC.\nIn recent years, the team has been very successful in NCR 7s, making nationals in the 2022 and 2023 seasons. In 2022, the Norsemen finished 10th in the country at this tournament. In 2023, the team finished 7th.\nAcademics &amp; community service.\nAlthough it competes at the intercollegiate level, Scranton Norsemen Rugby is officially a club sport. In addition to their many academic accomplishments, the Scranton ruggers fulfill regular service commitments to Habitat for Humanity, Lackawanna Housing and Development Corporation, and Hand-in-Hand. The club also regularly volunteers with Cinderella's Closet which allows girls of all ages to find dresses for Proms, Dances, and other functions at no cost.

His father wanted him to study law, and he began law school but stopped in 1924 in order to pursue a professional baseball career by attending spring training with the Boston Red Sox.\nAccording to Russo, Woods spent most of 1924 pitching for Charleston. The city did not have a minor league baseball team at this time, so the team was likely a semipro team. The Red Sox purchased his contract that September.\nBoston Red Sox.\nWoods's only Major League Baseball (MLB) game came on September 16, 1924, when the Red Sox played the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. It was late in the regular season, and both teams were over 20 games out of first place in the American League. With Boston trailing Chicago 8–4, the right-handed Woods relieved Red Ruffing to begin the eighth inning. He issued a walk to Frank Naleway, then got Buck Crouse to fly out to right fielder Ike Boone. Then, he issued another walk to Ted Blankenship before getting Johnny Mostil to pop out to third baseman Homer Ezzell in foul territory. He issued his third walk of the inning to Harry Hooper, loading the bases, before he induced Eddie Collins to fly out to center fielder Ira Flagstead to end the inning. The Red Sox failed to score in the ninth, losing 8–4. Though Woods allowed three base runners to reach in the game, he never allowed a run, giving him a lifetime earned run average of 0.00. Woods kept a baseball from the game as a souvenir; it was autographed by all of his teammates.\nMinor league career.\nAfter the 1924 season, the Spartanburg Spartans of the Class C South Atlantic League acquired Woods's contract, then sold it back to the Red Sox on March 20, 1925. Woods would not pitch in the major leagues for Boston again, spending most of 1925 with the Dover Dobbins of the Class D Eastern Shore League. Baseball-Reference.com credits him with 22 appearances for Dover, though the statistics are incomplete. According to baseball historian Frank Russo, Woods also played for the Binghamton Triplets of the Class B New York-Penn League in 1925. He played for the Easton Farmers of the Eastern Shore League in 1927. After tearing tendons and ligaments in his left shoulder while helping move a car out of a ditch, he retired.\nNorfolk Police Department.\nFollowing his retirement, Woods became a policeman in 1927 and joined the Norfolk Police Department (NPD) in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1929. Part of the reason he was hired was that the department desperately needed a pitcher for its baseball team. Woods progressed through the ranks of the department and attended the FBI National Academy. In 1939, he became the NPD's Chief of Police. He served as the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police in 1943. The second vice president of the International Chiefs of Police Association, he was in line to take over as the organization's president in 1947.\nOn October 4, 1946, Woods was responding to a car crash on Cottage Toll Road (now known as Tidewater Drive). When he arrived at the scene at 12:20 AM, he crashed into a parked tow truck. Suffering a broken neck and crushed right side of his chest, he died instantly. Only 48 years old, Woods was buried in Block 9, Lot 19, Space W of the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk on October 6.\nPersonal life.\nWoods married Sarah Elizabeth Charlton, a North Carolina resident, on July 12, 1922. They lived with Sarah's sister, M. Kathleen Wickers, and her children in Norfolk. The Woodses had three children: John Jr., George, and Robert. According to his widow, Woods was \"a very capable person, and a fine Christian gentleman\". Though Woods was listed at , during his career, his widow said that he weighed just in later years."

At San Diego State, he recruited future Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk (like him, a native New Orleanian), as well as wide receiver Darnay Scott. After San Diego State, Johnson spent single seasons at Southern Methodist University, and at the University of California (where he coached future All-American Bobby Shaw, among others), before taking a position at Miami in 1996.\nMiami.\nJohnson spent the next decade at Miami. As part of a staff that went to nine bowl games and won the 2001 National Championship, Johnson coached Andre Johnson, Santana Moss, and Reggie Wayne. He was also credited with recruiting standout safety Ed Reed, another native New Orleanian.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nJohnson was a member of Sean Payton's original Saints coaching staff. In his time there, he coached wide receivers Marques Colston, Devery Henderson, Robert Meachem, and Lance Moore, among others. From 2006–11, his wideouts combined for 108 touchdown grabs and 35 performances with over 100 yards receiving. He was part of the coaching staff for the team that won Super Bowl XLIV in the 2009 season.\nChicago Bears.\nOn February 15, 2016, Johnson was hired by the Bears as wide receivers coach to replace Mike Groh, who left for the same position with the Los Angeles Rams. After the season, he turned down an offer to remain with the Bears and left the team on January 30, 2017.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nHe rejoined the Saints in 2017 as a senior offensive assistant and in 2021 added the additional title of wide receivers coach.\nTulane.\nOn December 5, 2011, Johnson was named the new head coach of the Tulane Green Wave football team, replacing outgoing coach Bob Toledo. Johnson finished the NFL season with the Saints while simultaneously taking over the program at Tulane.\nOn November 28, 2015, Johnson was relieved of his duties as Tulane's head coach. After beginning the 2013 season 6–2, Johnson would go on to lose 22 of his final 27 games against Football Bowl Subdivision opponents. He finished at Tulane with a 15–34 record through four full seasons. He compiled a 7–9 conference record in the C-USA (2012 and 2013), and a 3–13 conference record in the American Athletic Conference (2014 and 2015).\nUpon Johnson's dismissal, Tulane Athletic Director Rick Dickson said \"I want to thank CJ for his hard work and his dedication to rebuilding the Green Wave football program. His efforts were rewarded in 2013 when Tulane reached its first bowl in 11 years. Since then, however, the program has not progressed to the level that we aspire to.\"\nHouston Gamblers.\nOn February 15, 2023, Johnson was hired by the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League (USFL) as their next head coach for the 2023 season.\nHouston Roughnecks.\nJohnson and all other Houston Gamblers players and coaches were all transferred to the Houston Roughnecks after it was announced that the Gamblers took on the identity of their XFL counterpart, the Roughnecks.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson was born in New Orleans and grew up in St. Rose, Louisiana, where his father was a St. Charles Parish councilman. He attended St. Charles Catholic High School in LaPlace, Louisiana. He was honored by his high school's community with an exhibit hosted by the St. Charles Museum and Historical Association and the River Road Historical Society in 2010. After high school, at the University of Idaho, Johnson played college football, ran track and field, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education. He and his wife Angel live in Harvey and have six children. Johnson is a deacon at his church, and has travelled to schools and camps promoting academic success, hard work and faith.\nOne of his sons, Curtis \"Trey\" Johnson III played wide receiver for the University of Memphis."

        "text": "Travis Jones (born June 6, 1972) is a former American football player and former assistant coach. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 and professional football for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League in 1995 and the Florida Bobcats of the Arena Football League in 1996. In a coaching career of more than 20 years, he was a member of Nick Saban's staff at LSU that led the 2003 team to the national championship. He was also an assistant coach on teams that won Super Bowl championships, first with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and later with the 2013 Seattle Seahawks. He was most recently an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL).\nPlaying career.\nJones played college football as a linebacker and later defensive tackle for the Georgia Bulldogs from 1990 to 1992 and 1994. He played for the 1992 Georgia team that recorded a 10–2 record and a No. 8 ranking. In the 1993 Citrus Bowl, he recovered a fumble from Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit in the fourth quarter to set up the winning score.\nJones was regarded as Georgia's best defensive lineman coming into the 1993 season. However, in August 1993, he was hospitalized with rhabdonmyolysis, a condition that results in the secretion of more waste than the kidneys can handle. Because the condition was exacerbated by exercise, some recommended that Jones retire from playing football. In mid-September, Jones announced his intention to return to the team. However, the team doctor opposed the comeback, and Jones was redshirted for the 1993 season. In October 1993, he was named to the College Football Association's Good Works Team for his work with Special Olympics and a local homeless shelter.\nJones made a comeback with Georgia in 1994.\nAfter graduating from Georgia, Jones played two years of professional football. He spent the 1995 season with the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League. In 1996, he played for the Florida Bobcats of the Arena Football League.\nCoaching career.\nJones began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Georgia. He has since spent more than 20 years as an assistant coach in college and professional football, including stints with Appalachian State (1998–2000), Kansas (2001–2002), LSU (2003–2004), Miami Dolphins (2005–2007), New Orleans Saints (2008–2012), Seattle Seahawks (2013–2017), and Atlanta Falcons (2018-2019).\nJones was a member of Nick Saban's staff at LSU that led the 2003 team to the national championship. He was also the position coach for 2003 SEC Defensive Player of the Years Chad Lavalais. He has also twice served as an assistant coach on teams that won Super Bowl championships, first with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and later as the defensive line coach for the 2013 Seattle Seahawks.\nIn 2010, he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and was suspended by the New Orleans Saints for 30 days for his role in a Texas real estate scam.\nOn April 9, 2018, Jones was hired as the assistant defensive line coach with the Atlanta Falcons. Jones returns to work under Coach Dan Quinn as Quinn's first season as Seattle’s defensive coordinator coincided with Jones' first season as defensive line coach with the Seahawks.\nThe Atlanta Falcons announced in January 2020 that Jones would not return to the coaching staff for the 2020 season."

        "text": "John Puckett North (June 17, 1921 – July 6, 2010) was an American football player and coach. He played offensive and defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Colts, as well as for the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He played college football at Vanderbilt University and was drafted in the sixth round of the 1945 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins.\nA native of Gilliam, North grew up in Old Hickory, Tenn. He lettered in football, basketball and track at Castle Heights High School in Tennessee. He is a member of the Castle Heights Hall of Fame.\nAfter receiving several offers, he signed with Vanderbilt, where he played football and basketball and ran track in 1942. But after his freshman year, he enlisted in the Marines to fight in World War II at the age of 17. He achieved the rank of sergeant, but was wounded on the Island of Tinian, having been shot multiple times in both calves, and was rushed to medical care. His parents were told that he had died, and upon discovering he was alive but injured, inquired about his condition. The doctors said he would never walk again. This proved only to hold true for about a year. He had begun walking around the hospital on his hands in his free time, and pushed himself hard in physical therapy, that he soon regained his strength. He was awarded a Purple Heart.\nAfter his playing career, North moved into coaching. He was a high school coach in Alabama, then in college at Tennessee Tech, Kentucky, and LSU before moving into the professional ranks with the Detroit Lions. In 1973, he became offensive coordinator of New Orleans Saints. With two games remaining in the 1973 preseason, head coach J.D. Roberts was fired and North was chosen to replace him. In his first regular season game, the Saints were embarrassed at Tulane Stadium by the rival Atlanta Falcons 62–7. New Orleans went 5–9 in both 1973 and 1974, the team's final seasons at Tulane Stadium. North led the Saints into the Louisiana Superdome in 1975, but was fired on October 27 following a 38–14 loss to the Los Angeles Rams which left the team 1–5. He subsequently spent seven years as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons and one season as quarterback coach for the USFL New Orleans Breakers."

The Broncos are led by head coach Leon Rice, hired in March 2010, and play their home games on campus at ExtraMile Arena in Boise, Idaho. BSU's most recent appearance in the NCAA tournament was in 2024.\nHistory.\nGreg Graham era.\nAthletic director Gene Bleymaier hired Greg Graham to be head coach in 2002. In eight seasons, Graham had a 142–112 record at Boise State and led Boise State to a berth in the 2004 NIT, 2008 NCAA tournament and 2009 CBI. For leading Boise State to the NCAA tournament, the Western Athletic Conference named Graham \"Coach of the Year\" in 2008.\nIn 2010, after a 15–17 season, Bleymaier fired Graham and stated: \"We appreciate everything that Coach Graham and his staff have contributed to Boise State the past eight years. We felt that in the best interest of the program we needed to make a change.\"\nLeon Rice era.\nLeon Rice replaced Graham as head coach of the Broncos on March 26, 2010. In his first season as head coach, he led Boise State to the finals of the 2011 WAC men's basketball tournament and to the semifinals of the 2011 College Basketball Invitational. He is the first Boise State head coach to win 20 games in two of his first three seasons and has 20 or more wins in eight of his ten seasons. In 2013, he guided the Broncos to their first ever at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. In 2015, he led the Broncos to their first ever Mountain West regular season championship, and first conference title for Boise State since 2008, and was named the Mountain West coach of the year. On February 13, 2021, Rice won his 214th game to become the winningest head coach in Boise State history. In 2022, Leon Rice led Boise to arguably their best season in school history. The Broncos won a program high 27 games, 15 conference games, the Mountain West conference regular season championship, Mountain West conference tournament, an 8-seed in the NCAA tournament and the highest AP ranking in program history at 23. The following season, Leon Rice helped lead the team to 24 wins and consecutive tournament bids for the second time in school history. In 2024, Leon Rice became the first coach in program history to lead the Broncos to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in ten NCAA Division I Tournaments, with a combined record of 0–10. They have the most NCAA tournament games played without a win (Iona had a win in the NCAA Tournament in 1980 before the NCAA stripped it away due to a violation, which means they are \"0-15\"). Their first five bids came via conference tournament championships, the first four in the Big Sky. The bid to the First Four in 2013 was the first at-large bid in program history, and they received a second in 2015. BSU made their eighth appearance in 2022 and returned the following year. Boise State set a new program record with three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in 2024.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nThe Broncos appeared in one NCAA Division II tournament (referred to at the time as the College Division), with a 1–1 record.\nNIT results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in seven National Invitational Tournaments (NIT), with a combined record of 5–7.\nCBI results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in two College Basketball Invitationals (CBI), with a combined record of 2–2."

        "text": "The 2009 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2008–09 season, and the culmination of the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Eastern Conference champion Pittsburgh Penguins and the Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings. It was Detroit's 24th appearance in the Finals and Pittsburgh's fourth appearance in the Finals. This was a rematch of the previous year's Stanley Cup Finals where Detroit had defeated Pittsburgh in six games. This time, Pittsburgh defeated Detroit in seven games to win their third Stanley Cup in franchise history. Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin would win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 playoffs, becoming the first Russian-born player to win the trophy. Until , this was the last time the finals were played entirely in the Eastern Time Zone.\nRoad to Finals.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nEntering the 2008–09 season as the Stanley Cup Champions, the Detroit Red Wings signed head coach Mike Babcock to three-year contract extension. Marian Hossa signed with the Red Wings after turning down a $49 million offer from the Penguins, whom he played for throughout the 2007–08 playoffs. The Red Wings also signed Ty Conklin, who had played for the Penguins throughout the 2007–08 season.\nThe Red Wings won the Central Division title with 112 points before defeating the Columbus Blue Jackets 4–0, rival Anaheim Ducks 4–3, and then-division rival Chicago Blackhawks 4–1 to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the sixth time in the past 14 seasons.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins were the reigning Eastern Conference Champions. After playing 57 games of the 2008–09 season, the Pittsburgh Penguins had a record of 27–25–5 and were five points out of playoff position. The organization fired head coach Michel Therrien and replaced him with Dan Bylsma, head coach of the organization's American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre. Under Bylsma, the team went 18–3–4, including 10–1–2 in March, losing one home game. Before the trade deadline, the Penguins acquired Chris Kunitz and Bill Guerin from the Anaheim Ducks and the New York Islanders respectively.\nThe Penguins qualified for the playoffs for their third consecutive season. They did not repeat as champions of the Atlantic Division, but earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with 99 points. They began the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 15 against their cross-state rival Philadelphia Flyers. They beat the Flyers 4–2, Washington Capitals 4–3, and Carolina Hurricanes 4–0 to earn a second-straight berth in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe Red Wings took game one, 3–1, as three different Detroit players scored goals off of unusual bounces. The first period featured back and forth action, with each team having a variety of chances. Detroit scored the first goal of the game at 13:38 into the first period when Brad Stuart's shot missed wide left, bounced off the end boards, and then deflected off the back of Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury's leg into the net. The Penguins tied the game at 18:37 when Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood mishandled a shot by Evgeni Malkin, allowing Ruslan Fedotenko to score. Malkin gained the initial opportunity after forcing defenceman Stuart into a turnover. The Penguins dominated the early portion of the second period, but Osgood kept the game even, including when he bailed his team out by stopping Malkin on a breakaway. The Red Wings bounced back and went ahead at 19:02 of the period after Brian Rafalski's shot rebounded off the end boards to Johan Franzen, who banked a shot off Fleury and into the net. Detroit's third goal of the game came at 2:46 of the third period when, after a save by Fleury on Ville Leino, the puck bounced high into the air and was swatted by Detroit rookie Justin Abdelkader from midair to his stick. Abdelkader then went around Pittsburgh's Jordan Staal (who had lost sight of the puck) and shot it above Fleury. Only three total penalties were called in the game, two on Detroit and one on Pittsburgh, but neither team could take advantage on their respective power plays as Osgood stopped 31 out of 32 shots while Fleury stopped 27 out of 30.\nGame two.\nGame two was another 3–1 victory for Detroit. Pittsburgh started out the game strong, setting up numerous chances from behind the net that were stopped by Chris Osgood. The Penguins then struck first at 16:50 of the opening period. After the Red Wings' Niklas Kronwall was sent to the penalty box for cross checking, Evgeni Malkin fired from the slot, and a scramble in front of the net ensued after Osgood gave up a rebound. The puck eventually came to Malkin for a second crack, and the shot was inadvertently deflected by Brad Stuart into his own net. Detroit took over in the second period, dominating in shots and benefiting from some luck, such as when Bill Guerin's wrist shot hit the inside of the post but stayed out of the net. Jonathan Ericsson tied the game at 4:21 of the second period, moments after the Penguins were forced to ice the puck after a long shift. Pittsburgh promptly lost the ensuing faceoff in their zone, allowing Ericsson to score from the point. Then at 10:29, the Red Wings went ahead after Valtteri Filppula was able to backhand a shot from a difficult angle into the net. Filppula scored after Fleury had stopped both Tomas Holmstrom and Marian Hossa, but could not hold the rebounds.\nAt 1:39 of the third period, Sidney Crosby peeled out of the corner and fired a shot that bounced off the post and rolled along the Detroit goal line. The play was reviewed by video replay, but the ruling on the ice was upheld as a no goal. Then at 2:47, Justin Abdelkader gave the Red Wings their third goal of the game, as he moved in slowly against the Pittsburgh defence and blasted a shot that caught Marc-Andre Fleury off guard as it landed in the net. Tensions flared up near the end of the game at 19:41 of the third period. Maxime Talbot was called for slashing, which eventually led to a fight between Malkin and Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg. Malkin received an instigator penalty and a misconduct penalty, but was not suspended by the league for the incident, despite Rule 47.22 (now Rule 46.21) of the NHL rulebook automatically imposing the suspension.\nGame three.\nThe Penguins won game three, 4–2, cutting their deficit in the series in half. Pittsburgh got off to a strong offensive start and scored first at 4:48 of the opening period when Evgeni Malkin set up Maxime Talbot, who fired a one-timed snapshot. Detroit answered less than two minutes later with a Henrik Zetterberg goal at 6:19 in the period. Zetterberg scored on a rebound after Ville Leino's wrap-around attempt was stopped by Marc-Andre Fleury. After Pittsburgh's Brooks Orpik was called for interference, Johan Franzen responding by scoring a goal at 11:33 with under ten seconds left in the penalty. Franzen's score was a one-timer that resulted after Zetterberg fed him a pass around the goal crease. While Detroit dominated the middle of the first period, at one point firing nine straight shots, the Penguins caught a break when the officials missed a penalty for too many men when Pittsburgh had inadvertently created their own powerplay, and played with six men for nearly 30 seconds. Pittsburgh then used a late holding call on Daniel Cleary to set up a game-tying power play goal. Defenceman Kris Letang fanned on a one-time attempt as he took a pass from Malkin, but regained control of the puck and fired a wrist shot into the net.\nThe score remained unchanged through the second period, although Detroit had numerous scoring chances. The Penguins' Fleury stopped 16 Detroit shots in the frame, and caught a break as Mikael Samuelsson hit the post on a breakaway. The Penguins came out with strong defence in the third period, and the Detroit offence sputtered, at one point going over ten minutes without a shot. Midway through the third period, the Penguins earned a power play opportunity after Jonathan Ericsson was called for interference. At 10:29, Sergei Gonchar drilled a slapshot from near the blue line, which sailed through traffic and beat a screened Chris Osgood to give the Penguins the lead. Detroit could not mount a late surge with the extra attacker on the ice, and Talbot added an empty net goal at 19:03 for his second of the game to seal the victory.\nGame four.\nThe Penguins picked up a 4–2 win in game four, equalling their performance from the previous meeting. Detroit found themselves at an early disadvantage, as a tripping call on Niklas Kronwall gave Pittsburgh a power play just over a minute into the game. Evgeni Malkin scored with the man advantage at 2:39 to give the Penguins an early lead. The goal occurred after Chris Osgood stopped a Jordan Staal shot, then Kris Letang fired a rebound wide that was picked up by Malkin and deposited behind the outstretched goaltender. Detroit ended the first period on a relentless assault, but Marc-Andre Fleury held the fort in goal for Pittsburgh, including a sequence in which he stopped four Detroit shots seconds apart. On that shift, Fleury cancelled a Darren Helm wrap around attempt, stood up to stop Mikael Samuelsson's rebound one-timer, then stopped Daniel Cleary on two more rebound tries. With 19 shots in the period, Detroit would eventually score at 18:19, after Helm forced Rob Scuderi into a turnover on a clearing attempt, then fired a wrist shot into the goal.\nDetroit took the lead early in the second period, after Henrik Zetterberg passed from behind the net to Brad Stuart at the point. Stuart's slap shot at 0:46 beat a screened Fleury, but provided one of the few sparks for Detroit in a nightmarish period. After Brooks Orpik was called for tripping, it was the Penguins who picked up great scoring opportunities during the Detroit power play. First, Osgood stopped Malkin on a breakaway. However, he was not able to keep Staal from scoring shorthanded. At 8:35, Staal lit the lamp after dragging the puck around Brian Rafalski by using his long reach. Just under two minutes later, Sidney Crosby finally scored his first goal of the series. Malkin stripped Brad Stuart, who had just mishandled a pass, and started a two-on-one with Crosby, who took the pass at 10:34 and shoved it into the net. At 14:12 in the period, Tyler Kennedy scored to extend the Pittsburgh lead. The play began when Kennedy beat Henrik Zetterberg to the puck on the forecheck. Chris Kunitz then took the puck and fed a pass to Crosby, who one-touched it to Kennedy for the goal, as Osgood was caught moving side-to-side. The third period featured several good chances by each team, but neither team was able to score and the game ended with a tied series.\nGame five.\nDetroit gained a huge boost in game five, as star two-way player Pavel Datsyuk played for the first time in the series after returning from a foot injury. The Penguins were the team that began the match with energy, dominating the first five minutes, and producing a variety of chances from the Evgeni Malkin–Ruslan Fedotenko–Maxime Talbot line. However, the Red Wings rallied around a rejuvenated Datsyuk to take over the game midway through the period. Datsuyk's skating allowed Detroit to score at 13:32 of the period, as he fed a pass to Daniel Cleary during a three-on-three transition play. Cleary used Penguins' defenceman Brooks Orpik as a screen as he shot the puck past goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The Penguins began to unravel in the second period, committing five minor penalties in the frame. This undisciplined hockey allowed Detroit to score three power play goals and one marker that occurred seconds after a penalty had expired.\nAt 1:44 of the second, the Red Wings scored their second goal. On the final seconds of a power play, Fleury made a sprawling save on Datsuyk, the puck was cleared, and the penalty expired. However, as the Penguins attempted to make a line change, goaltender Chris Osgood fed a long pass for Detroit to Marian Hossa, who slipped a pass into the slot, enabling a streaking Valtteri Filppula to score on the backhand. Three straight penalty calls on Pittsburgh would then lead to Red Wing scores. A slashing minor on Sergei Gonchar eventually allowed a high wrist shot by Niklas Kronwall at 8:35 to find the back of the net. Kronwall scored after pinching into the corner and playing in a forward position. He then took a pass from Johan Franzen and patiently waited for Fleury to go down before lifting the puck. An elbowing penalty on Evgeni Malkin led to a Brian Rafalski goal at 11:34, which saw the defenceman take a pass from Datsyuk and score on a wrist shot from the right circle. A Chris Kunitz roughing penalty set up Henrik Zetterberg. At 15:40, Zetterberg took a shot-pass from Jiri Hudler and peeled to the front of the net to deposit the puck over Fleury's glove. After giving up the fifth goal, Fleury was replaced by Mathieu Garon, and the Penguins committed two more penalties in the second to give Detroit a two-man advantage on which they did not convert. The third period was mostly uneventful and the score remained 5–0 until the end of the game.\nGame six.\nThe Penguins defeated the Red Wings in game six, 2–1, to force a seventh and deciding game of the finals. The first period featured strong defensive play by both teams. Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury made a big early save as he stopped a one-timer by Henrik Zetterberg, who had just received a pass from Pavel Datsyuk on a two-on-one rush. Detroit's Chris Osgood equalled Fleury's early brilliance, as he stopped Sidney Crosby on two separate power plays, first by stuffing his attempt to jam home a puck in the crease, then by denying him on a rush through the slot in transition. After a scoreless first period, Jordan Staal scored Pittsburgh's first goal at 0:51 in the second. Tyler Kennedy chipped a puck away from Valtteri Filppula in the Detroit zone, then passed the puck to Staal to start a two-on-one break. Osgood stopped Staal's first shot by tipping it with his glove, before the rebound was deposited into the net.\nPittsburgh dominated the second period, but did not score again in the frame. They also caught a break as Zetterberg's forehand shot from the slot hit the post and was then held by Fleury as it ricochet off his back. Kennedy gave the Penguins their second goal at 5:35 of the third after gaining the puck by cycling behind Detroit's net with Maxime Talbot. Two Red Wing defenders went to Talbot, which gave Kennedy a clear lane to walk in front of the net and lift a shot high over Osgood. Kris Draper cut the Pittsburgh lead at 8:01, beating Marc-Andre Fleury on a wrist shot. The goal came after Jonathan Ericsson's slapshot was kicked aside and Draper was able to take the rebound and glide into scoring position. The Red Wings found their stride late in the game, but were thwarted on two late scoring chances. With 1:42 remaining, Daniel Cleary raced into the Penguins zone on a breakaway, but his shot was turned aside by Fleury. In the final thirty seconds, an unlikely hero stepped up for the Penguins. After Fleury stopped Datsyuk's shot, the puck came to the goal mouth, where Johan Franzen was ready to pounce. However, with Fleury out of position, Pittsburgh defenceman Rob Scuderi stepped in front of the loose puck and blocked three Franzen shots with his skates to preserve a win. This was the last ever Stanley Cup Finals game played at Mellon Arena.\nGame seven.\nFor the first time, the Pittsburgh Penguins played a seventh game in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the Red Wings made their seventh appearance in the deciding game. Detroit had previously gone 3–3 in game sevens. Their last Stanley Cup Finals game seven was in against the Toronto Maple Leafs, where they lost by the score of 4–0 in Maple Leaf Gardens. Entering the contest, Red Wings head coach Mike Babcock joined Mike Keenan as the only men to coach Game 7's of the Stanley Cup Finals with two different teams, having been with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim when they lost to the New Jersey Devils in (the home team won all seven games of the series). Over the whole series, the Red Wings outscored the Penguins 17–14.\nThe opening half of the first period featured tentative play by both teams but with Pittsburgh outperforming Detroit offensively in the frame. However, the Red Wings got the best scoring chance, as Kirk Maltby gained possession of a bouncing puck after a faceoff in the Penguins' zone. Maltby's shot was then stopped by the glove of goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury from point blank range. At 1:13 in the second period, Pittsburgh struck first, as Maxime Talbot scored following a turnover. The goal resulted after Brad Stuart attempted to clear the zone following a dump-in by Brooks Orpik into Detroit territory. Evgeni Malkin used his skates to block Stuart's pass, and the puck found its way to Talbot, who patiently waited to find a shooting lane behind goaltender Chris Osgood. Both teams gained chances through the middle of the period, with each goalie coming up strong. On one sequence, Brian Rafalski made a quick pass to Darren Helm in the left circle, where he was stopped by Fleury. As Rafalski set up for a rebound shot, he lost the puck to Pittsburgh's Matt Cooke, who was then stuffed on a breakaway attempt. Soon afterward, Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was crunched into the boards by Johan Franzen and sustained a knee injury. He would be healthy enough to play only one shift for the remainder of the game.\nTalbot struck again at 10:07 in the period, as he curled the puck to fake a pass during a two-on-one break, then lifted it over Osgood's shoulder. The play began with Chris Kunitz splitting the Detroit defence with a pass in his own zone, allowing Talbot and Tyler Kennedy to move in on an odd man rush. The Penguins attempted to play conservatively in the third period and registered only one shot in the frame. At the same time, Detroit was able to sustain pressure on several occasions during the period. At 13:53, the Red Wings got on the board, as Jonathan Ericsson drilled a one-timed slapshot behind Fleury from near the blue line, after receiving a pass from Niklas Lidstrom. Then, at 17:45, Detroit came within inches of pulling into a tie. However, Niklas Kronwall's wristshot from the right circle ricocheted off of Jordan Staal, hit the crossbar, then bounced away from any Red Wing skaters. Detroit gained one last chance on the final shift of the game. After stopping an initial Henrik Zetterberg shot from the right faceoff circle, the rebound came loose to Nicklas Lidstrom at the left faceoff circle, forcing Fleury to make a diving stop with two seconds remaining to preserve the win and the championship. Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy after the game as the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 playoffs, becoming the first Russian-born player to win the trophy.\nThe Penguins became the first team since the Montreal Canadiens to win game seven of the Finals on the road. They were also the first road team to win game seven of a championship round, in any major league sport, since the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Baltimore Orioles 4–1 at Memorial Stadium to win the 1979 World Series. For the Red Wings, it was the first time that they lost in the Finals since , when they were swept by the Devils. It was also the first time that the visiting team has won the Cup at Joe Louis Arena in the venue's 30-year history, and the Penguins became the first visiting team to win the Cup in Detroit since the Montreal Canadiens did so in at the now-demolished Olympia Stadium. They were also the first team to win the Stanley Cup without finishing first in a division during the regular season since the Devils in 2000. This was the last ever Stanley Cup Finals game played at Joe Louis Arena.\nOfficials.\nThe following officials worked the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals: (Bold-face indicates worked Game 7)\nTelevision coverage.\nIn Canada, all games of the Finals were broadcast in English on the CBC and in French on the cable network RDS. CBC had a new broadcast team calling the Finals with Jim Hughson as play-by-play announcer, and Craig Simpson as colour commentator.\nIn the United States, this was the first time since 1999 that game one of the Cup Finals aired on over-the-air television instead of on cable: NBC broadcast the first two and final three games of the series, while Versus broadcast games three and four. The first two games of the series were played on consecutive nights due to NBC's scheduling, specifically to avoid putting a contest on the network during the debut week of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" on June 1–5. This was also done to help promote the game and keep the hockey viewership growing. Games four and six ended up going head-to-head with games one and three of the 2009 NBA Finals, respectively.\nGame seven was the last major sporting event on analogue television in the United States, with the DTV transition finishing less than an hour-and-a-half after the game ended and just one hour after NBC coverage ended. NBC affiliates WDIV-TV in Detroit and WPXI in Pittsburgh – who months before the Stanley Cup playoffs began electing to keep their own respective analogue signals on until June 12, well past the original February 17 deadline – both remained on the air for game seven before cutting their analogue signals at 11:59 EDT.\nRatings.\nIn the United States, with an average of eight million viewers, game seven was the most-watched NHL game in the United States since game six of the 1973 Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn Canada, game seven drew an average of 3.529 million viewers to the CBC. However, it averaged 2.154 million viewers for the seven-game rematch, down 7% from the 2008 Finals.\nRecords.\nThe Red Wings attempted to become the first team to successfully defend a championship since they did it in . The Red Wings were also the first defending Stanley Cup champions to reach the Finals since , when the champions New Jersey Devils lost to the Colorado Avalanche.\nThe Penguins became the first team since the Edmonton Oilers in to win the Stanley Cup after having lost in the Finals the year before; it was also the first instance of a Stanley Cup Finals rematch since then. They were the first team in major professional sports to win a game seven of the championship round on the road since the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball. They also became the third team to win a game seven in the Stanley Cup Finals as the visitor, the first since the Montreal Canadiens in (the Toronto Maple Leafs in being the other).\nSeeded fourth in the Eastern Conference, the Penguins became the lowest-seeded team to win the Cup since the fourth-seeded New Jersey Devils in 2000, and tied for eighth overall in the NHL, they became (along with the 1991 Penguins and 1995 Devils), the only teams in the post-1967 expansion era to finish outside the top six overall and win the Cup. The last team to win a Stanley Cup with fewer than 100 points in the season was the 1997 Detroit Red Wings, with 94.\nThe Penguins' Cup victory, coupled with that of the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII four months earlier, gave the city of Pittsburgh the distinction of being the only city to win a Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup in the same year. However, Detroit holds the distinction of being the first city to have NFL champions and NHL champions in the same city in the same year, 1952. Detroit sports fans also previously experienced a similar event in 1935 when the Tigers and Lions both won championships, and the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in the 1935–36 season, a span of only 6 months and 4 days. The \"City of Champions\" gained multiple titles in the same year for the second time and first time in 30 years (the Pirates won the 1979 World Series in between the Steelers' victories in Super Bowl XIII in January 1979 and Super Bowl XIV in January 1980). It also gives the state of Pennsylvania three champions in the four major professional sports in a span of nine months, with the Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series the previous October.\nThis was the second consecutive year that two American-based NHL teams competed for the championship, and the first time that two teams met in the Stanley Cup Finals in consecutive seasons since the Edmonton Oilers and the New York Islanders did so in and .\nThe first two games were played at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on consecutive weekend nights—May 30 and 31—the first time that Finals games have been played on consecutive days since .\nDetroit's loss gave Mike Babcock the unfortunate distinction of being the first coach in NHL history to lose game seven of a Stanley Cup Finals with two different teams. Mike Keenan, the other to coach in two Finals game sevens with two different teams, had avoided the distinction by winning the second Finals game seven he coached. He was with the Philadelphia Flyers in when they lost to the Edmonton Oilers, and was with the New York Rangers when they won the Cup in .\nThis was the last Stanley Cup Finals played at both Mellon Arena and Joe Louis Arena, which was closed after the following season and the 2016–17 season, respectively. The Penguins moved to the Consol Energy Center for the 2010–11 season, and the Red Wings moved to Little Caesars Arena for the 2017–18 season. This was also the last Stanley Cup Finals that was ever played entirely in one time zone, as the Eastern Conference now consists of all of the league's teams that are based in the Eastern Time Zone, while the Western Conference consists entirely of the NHL's teams that are based outside of it.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2009 Stanley Cup was presented to Penguins captain Sidney Crosby by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Penguins 2–1 win over the Red Wings in game seven.\nThe following Penguins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2008–09 Pittsburgh Penguins\nDan Bylsma was the 13th rookie coach to win the Stanley Cup and the first since 1986. Bylsma only coached 25 regular season games, before leading Pittsburgh to the Stanley Cup Finals. He is the second mid-season replacement rookie coach to win the Stanley Cup (See 1971 Stanley Cup Finals for the other coach, Al MacNeil). Bylsma was also a player under Mike Babcock on the 2002–03 and 2003-04 roster of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.\nIncluded on the team picture, but left off the Stanley Cup."

        "text": "The men's foil was a fencing event held as part of the Fencing at the 1920 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fifth appearance of the event. A total of 56 fencers from 10 nations competed in the event, which was held on August 17 and August 18, 1920. Nations were limited to eight fencers each, with Belgium and Italy entering the maximum. Nedo Nadi of Italy repeated as Olympic champion, retaining the title he initially won at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Philippe Cattiau and Roger Ducret of France earned silver and bronze, respectively, returning France to the podium for the first time since 1900.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the 1912 finalists returned after the war: gold medalist Nedo Nadi and silver medalist Pietro Speciale of Italy and sixth-place finisher Edgar Seligman and eighth-place finisher Robert Montgomerie of Great Britain.\nCzechoslovakia and Egypt each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its fourth appearance, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition. France, a perennial power in the event, returned after not traveling to St. Louis in 1904 and boycotting the 1912 fencing competitions over rules disputes.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a three-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to three touches (an unpopular change from the more typical five). Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches."

        "title": "Wichita State Shockers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I college basketball program representing Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas.\nThe Shockers have made 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Final Four twice, the Elite Eight four times, and the Sweet Sixteen six times. The team plays its home games at Charles Koch Arena, where it averaged 10,391 fans per game in 2012, ranking 38th nationally.\nThe Shockers have made two Final Four appearances, losing both games. They made their first Final Four appearance in 1965 losing to UCLA 89–108. They made their second appearance in 2013, losing to Louisville 68–72.\nIn 2014, Wichita State defeated the Northern Iowa Panthers in the regular season finale for their 9th Missouri Valley conference regular season title, becoming two-time defending MVC champions. The Shockers completed a perfect, undefeated regular season and swept the conference post-season tournament en route to a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament where they lost to eventual national runner-up Kentucky in the round of 32.\nThe Shockers competed in the Missouri Valley Conference from 1949–50 to 2016–17 and have competed in the American Athletic Conference since the 2017–18 season.\nHistory.\nWichita State, then known as Fairmount College, first took the court in 1906 under head coach Willis Bates. During this time, the sports teams were known as the \"Wheatshockers\". The first official game was held in the basement of Fairmount Hall. Fairmount lost to Washburn University by a score of 37–10. During this inaugural season, the Wheatshockers only won two games.\nFairmount acquired a permanent home when Memorial Gymnasium was opened on January 15, 1921, in a game against the American Legion of Wichita. The gym was later renamed Henrion Gymnasium in 1926. That same year, the newly renamed Municipal University of Wichita (popularly known as \"WU\") joined the Central Conference in athletics.\nWU gained notice outside of Wichita in 1927 when, led by First-Team All-American Ross McBurney and Second-Team All-American Harold Reynolds, the Wheatshockers finished the 1927 season with a 13–1 record and a second-place finish behind conference champions Pittsburg State University.\nEarly success.\nShocker basketball achieved greater success with the arrival of Coach Ralph Miller and Cleo Littleton in 1951. Littleton averaged 18.2 points per game as a freshman, a school record that still stands today. He was the first player west of the Mississippi to score 2,000 points in his college career and is one of only five Wichita State players to have his number retired. He was also one of the first African American players in the Missouri Valley Conference, which it joined in 1945. Littleton averaged 19 points per game during his career and he still owns 7 school records. Due to this success, Wichita State decided to construct a new home for the Shockers. Through appropriated money by the WU Board of Regents, Wichita State was able to construct a new field house for the men's basketball team, costing $1.4 million. On December 3, 1955, the Shockers played their first game in WU Field House in front of more than 9,000 fans.\nDave Stallworth entered the program in the 1961–62 season. Nicknamed \"The Rave\", Stallworth became the Shockers' first consensus All-American in 1964. He finished with a career scoring average of 24.2 points per game and was second on the all-time scoring list with 1,936 points. During his 13-year stint at WSU, Ralph Miller became the winningest coach in Shocker basketball history, collecting 255 victories. Miller is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and currently ranks as the eighth-winningest coach in college basketball history.\nFirst Final Four.\nThe 1964–65 season—the first after Wichita joined the state university system as Wichita State University—was the greatest in Shocker history until the 2013–14 season. On December 14, 1964, Gary Thompson led Wichita State to its first-ever No. 1 ranking. The 19–7 Shockers won the MVC and earned a berth into the Midwest Regional. After defeating Southern Methodist and an Oklahoma State team led by Henry Iba, the Shockers headed to the Final Four in Portland. There, the Shockers were matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins, losing 108–89. The Shockers played a third-place game against Princeton, losing 118–82.\nDuring this period, Warren Armstrong played for the Shockers and made major contributions throughout his career. During his sophomore season, Armstrong set two school records, averaging almost 12 rebounds a game while setting a Shocker single-game assist mark with 12. Armstrong became a three-time all-Valley performer from 1966 to 1968, and still holds four of WSU's 10 triple double games (double-figure points, rebounds, assist, or blocks). He would later enjoy a productive career in the ABA. Terry Benton became a key contributor during this era as well, setting a WSU record of 16.8 rebounds per game for his career, and finishing his Wichita State career with 1,003 points and 963 rebounds.\nHarry Miller era.\nWichita State went 97–90 from 1971 to 1978 under Harry Miller. They had several notable players during those years including Rich Morsden, Bob Wilson, Robert Gray, Bob Trogele, Cheese Johnson, Cal Bruton and Bob Elmore. They made it to the NCAA tournament in 1976, winning the Missouri Valley Conference and losing by one point to eventual national runner up Michigan. The following year they beat eventual NCAA Champion Marquette in Al McGuire's final home game in Milwaukee.\nElite Eight appearance and sanctions.\nIn 1981, the Shockers would return to the NCAA tournament, defeating the Kansas Jayhawks 66–65 in the \"Battle of New Orleans\" before being defeated by LSU 96–85 in the Elite Eight. The 1980–81 team featured two future NBA players – Cliff Levingston and Antoine Carr, who would be chosen in the first 10 picks of the NBA draft. Carr, a local star from Wichita, would become WSU's third All-American in 1983, averaging 22.2 points a game during his senior season, and finishing his career with 1,911 points while shooting 55.7 percent. Levingston would average 15.7 and 18.5 points per game while leading the team in scoring his freshman and sophomore years, before declaring early for the NBA Draft.\nAnother future NBA player, Xavier McDaniel, would arrive the year after the Elite Eight season. McDaniel scored 2,152 points at Wichita State, second all-time behind Littleton, and set the school record with 1,359 rebounds. In 1984–85, McDaniel became the first player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring (27.2 points per game) and rebounding (14.8 per game) in the same season.\nIn 1982, Wichita State would be placed under NCAA probation for the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons, regarding improper actions of former assistant coaches in the late 1970s.\nIn nine seasons, Smithson won 155 games, placing him second in school history behind Ralph Miller. Smithson was the first coach to guide WSU to consecutive 20-win seasons. During the four-year span from 1980 to 1984, WSU produced a 92–29 record, the best four-year span in team history at the time.\nReturn to the tournament.\nWSU hired Topeka, Kansas native Mark Turgeon as head coach on March 11, 2000. Turgeon guided the Shockers to a 9–19 record during his first season. In Turgeon's second year Wichita State began its resurgence with a combination of several veterans and newcomers to compile a 15–15 record in 2001–02.\nHelped by an 11–3 record in Levitt Arena, WSU's overall record in the arena rose to 502–185 since it opened during the 1955–56 season. In the 2002–03 season, the Shockers would improve to 18 wins, and then to 21 wins in the 2003–04 season.\nIn 2004–05, Wichita State continued to improve, reaching the third game of the NIT, and taking the Shockers to back-to-back-to-back postseason trips for the first time since 1987–88–89. WSU's 2004–05 team went 22–10 overall, finished second in the Missouri Valley Conference, and were ranked in the top 30 for nine weeks.\nIn 2005–06, Turgeon lead WSU to its best season in over 20 years, reaching the Sweet 16 with victories over 10th seeded Seton Hall and shocking 2nd seeded Tennessee. In the Sweet 16, the Shockers would go on to lose to eventual Final Four participant George Mason.\nIn 2006–07, the Shockers entered the season with high expectations, and surged out to a 9–0 start, including a revenge-win over George Mason, as well as road victories over #6 LSU and #14 Syracuse. WSU rose as high as #8 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls on December 18, 2006, but the Shockers would struggle for much of the rest of the season, falling from the rankings and finishing 17–14, including only eight conference wins, for Turgeon's second worst mark as WSU head coach.\nHead Coach Mark Turgeon left Wichita State on April 10, 2007, after a seven-year run and a 128–90 record, (at the time) the third winningest coach in Shocker history behind Ralph Miller and Gene Smithson. On April 14, 2007, Gregg Marshall was announced as 26th head men's basketball coach at Wichita State.\nSecond Final Four and undefeated regular season.\nGregg Marshall previously coached at Winthrop University for nine seasons. In his first season (2007–08) the team finished with a record of 11–20. In his second season they posted a 17–17 record, complete with a run to the second round of the 2009 CBI Tournament where they lost to Stanford. The following season the Shockers went 25–10, culminating with an NIT appearance. The invitation was due in large part to their strong 16–1 home record. Their only loss at home that year was in the NIT against Nevada.\nIn the 2010–11 season Wichita State improved once again to finish the season at 29–8, finishing second in the Missouri Valley to Missouri State. The Shockers would go on to win the NIT championship as a 4 seed, defeating two #1 seeds, first Virginia Tech 79–76, and then beating Alabama in the championship game 66–57.\nIn the 2011–12 season, they continued to improve under Marshall's guidance. In winning the regular season MVC title at 16–2 (26–4 overall), the Shockers reached a ranking of #14 in the coaches poll and #15 in the AP poll. After losing to Illinois State in the semi-finals of the MVC tourney in St. Louis, the Shockers were selected at large for the NCAA tournament as a 5 seed, their first NCAA Tournament in 6 years. They fell to VCU 62–59, ending the season with a 27–6 record.\nHeading into the 2012–2013 season, despite being the reigning regular-season champions, the Shockers were predicted to finish fourth in the Missouri Valley Conference. Wichita State went into the season having lost five of the top six scorers from the previous season, including Joe Ragland, Toure' Murry, Garrett Stutz, Ben Smith, and David Kyles. Despite the losses, the Shockers went on to win their first 9 games, including the Cancún Challenge, as well as 15 of their first 16, and 19 of their first 21. Wichita struggled in conference-play, however, losing three in a row in late January and early February. Nevertheless, the Shockers would eventually play rival Creighton in the final game of the season for the outright conference championship, losing in Omaha.\nIn the 2012–13 NCAA tournament, the Shockers upset top-seeded Gonzaga to move on to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2006, followed by a 72–58 win over La Salle for their first Elite Eight appearance since 1981. They defeated Ohio State 70–66 for their first Final Four appearance since 1965, as well as their 30th win of the season, a then-Wichita State record. In the Final Four, Wichita State was defeated by the #1 overall seed and eventual tournament champion Louisville, 72–68 but that game was later vacated in 2018 by the NCAA.\nThe 2013–14 season proved to be historic and possibly the greatest season in Shocker history. The Shockers cracked the top 10 at #2 in the nation in both major polls, for the first time since December 2006. It was the highest that the Shockers had been ranked that late in the season in school history. On February 25, with a win over Bradley, the Shockers became just the 11th Division I team to start the season 30–0. They were also the first team to do so solely in the regular season, as the prior 10 teams reached that mark in the postseason. A week later, with a dominating 68–45 win over Missouri State, the Shockers became the first Division I team to finish the regular season 31–0. The Shockers ran the table with the 2014 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament, winning all three games by double digits. This was the first time Wichita State won the Valley Tournament since 1987. The Shockers received the #1 ranking in the Midwest Region of the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Wichita State blew out their first opponent, Cal Poly to become the first team in the history of college basketball to advance to a record of 35–0 (a mark matched by Kentucky in the 2014–15 season). The Shockers season ended with an instant classic of a game with the Kentucky Wildcats on a missed 3-pointer at the buzzer. Their final record ended up being 35–1.\nMarshall departure and decline.\nAfter the 2019–20 season, eight Shockers players entered the NCAA transfer portal, with seven eventually leaving the program. During this period, several former players alleged a pattern of physical and verbal abuse of players, leading to the university hiring a St. Louis-based law firm to conduct an independent investigation. Marshall resigned shortly before the 2020–21 season, with Wichita State buying out his contract for $7.75 million over six years. Assistant coach Isaac Brown was named interim head coach for 2020–21.\nIn Brown's first year, he took the Shockers to the NCAA Tournament but lost to Drake in the First Four. During the season, he was named full-time head coach. The following 2 seasons, the Shockers would finish 32–28 and were not invited to any postseason tournament. This led to Wichita State firing Brown on March 11, 2023.\nWichita State hired Paul Mills on March 22, 2023.\nRivalries.\nWhen Wichita State became an AP Top 25 regular in the early 2010s, there came interest in reviving annual games against Kansas and Kansas State. In February 2013, Kansas state senator Michael O'Donnell introduced a bill requiring Kansas and Kansas State to schedule Wichita State, but the bill never passed. Kansas and Wichita State scheduled a game for the 2023–24 season, their first regular season game since 1993. Wichita State last played Kansas in the 2015 NCAA tournament, a game they won 78–65. Kansas leads the all-time series 12–3. They last played Kansas State in the 2023–24 season, a game which they lost 60–69. Kansas State leads the all-time series 20–9.\nMissouri State.\nWichita State had an in-conference rivalry with Missouri State dating back to the 1941–42 season (when Missouri State University was Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College). As of the 2016–17 season, following a 15-game winning streak in the series, Wichita State leads the series 39–30.\nTulsa.\nWichita State's rivalry with Tulsa dates back to the 1930–31 season. The two schools were in the Missouri Valley Conference from 1945 to 1996. Beginning in the 1996–97 season, this series continued as an out-of-conference rivalry and has been most recently continuously played since the 2010–11 season, after being played in the 1996–97, 1997–98, and 2000–01 to 2004–05 seasons. As of the end of the 2020–21 season, Wichita State leads the series 72–62 following 15 games since the series resumed in 2010. Tulsa ended WSU's 5-game winning streak with a buzzer-beating 3-point win in Tulsa in February 2020, but WSU has won three since then, two at home and one on the road, including a tight 4-point game.\nCreighton.\nWichita State had an intense rivalry with the Creighton Bluejays during their time together in the Missouri Valley. Both squads were known as the cream of the crop in the MVC and went back and forth every year, trading the title of best team in the league. In all, the teams have played a total of 100 games against each other, with Creighton leading the overall series 55–45.\nFacilities.\nThe Shockers have played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, a 10,506 seat on-campus arena, since 1953. Originally known as the University of Wichita Field House, it was officially renamed Levitt Arena in 1969 for Henry Levitt, owner of Henry's, who sponsored a Wichita basketball team (known as the Henry Clothiers) that won three consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in the 1930s. Due to its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action, it was quickly nicknamed \"The Roundhouse.\" Following a $6 million endowment from Charles G. Koch the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002–03, popularly known as the \"Roundhouse Renaissance.\" The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint. The Shocker basketball teams played at the Kansas Coliseum for the 2002–03 season while the arena was rebuilt. In 2012, the Shockers averaged 10,391 fans per game, ranking 38th nationally. In January 2013, ESPN's Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball.\nIn addition to Koch Arena, the Shockers have played one game for each of the last eleven seasons (except 2020–21) across town at the Intrust Bank Arena, the second largest indoor arena in the state of Kansas at 15,004 seats. Wichita State is 8–3 (as of the 2020–21 season) when playing at Intrust Bank Arena.\nCoaches.\nThe Shockers have had 27 head coaches in program history. Of these, only 7 coached five or more seasons. They have had two different coaches take them to the Final Four and seven different coaches have taken them to the NCAA Tournament. Gregg Marshall is the all-time leader in wins, win percentage among coaches who have coached at least 25 games, tournament appearances, and tournament wins. Marshall also has just as many tournament appearances as every other coach in program history combined and is the longest-tenured head coach in program history having coached for 13 seasons.\nPlayers in international leagues.\nOlympians.\nThe following Shockers represented their country in the Olympics. Both participants represented the United States.\nPostseason history.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Shockers have appeared in 16 NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 18–17. \nNIT results.\nThe Shockers have appeared in 13 National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 11–12. They were NIT champions in 2011.\nCBI results.\nThe Shockers have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational. Their combined record is 1–1."

        "text": "The three stars () in ice hockey are the three best players in a game, with the \"first star\" considered the best of the three players, akin to the player of the match in other sports. Media representatives of the home team choose the three stars, who are usually the top point scorers or outstanding goaltenders from either team.\nUsage.\nThree stars were first awarded in the 1936–37 NHL season as a means for Imperial Oil (\"Hockey Night in Canada\"s then new principal sponsor) to advertise its “Three Star” brand of gasoline. In addition, it was seen as a way to promote the game's best stars of the time. After the sponsorship ended in 1976, the tradition remained on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's flagship hockey show.\nThe usage of three stars has since expanded greatly. All professional hockey teams (or radio/television broadcasts of those teams) in North America award three stars at the end of each game, and many amateur and collegiate leagues (or broadcasts of their games) do as well. The National Hockey League awards three stars during every game, in both the regular season and Stanley Cup Playoffs, and not just limited to those shown on HNIC. Media representatives of the home team make the selections. It also awards a nightly set of three stars, which are the three best players out of all who played a game in the league on a given night. Also, in the 2007–08 NHL season, the previous awards of “Offensive Player of the Week” and “Defensive Player of the Week” were replaced by the “Three Stars of the Week”, while the similar awards of “Offensive Player of the Month” and “Defensive Player of the Month” were replaced by the “Three Stars of the Month”.\nThe NHL also has a system which awards points to its nightly three stars: 30 points to the first star, 20 points to the second, and 10 to the third. It keeps a running tally of the number of points each player has been awarded . NHL teams may use these standings; for example, the Vancouver Canucks award a sum to a charity chosen by its player who earned the highest number of points that month. The Molson Cup is also awarded to the top point-earner of the year of each Canadian team.\nDespite its popularity in North America, three stars are generally not awarded during international play, such as at the Winter Olympic Games. The IIHF World Championships and World Junior Championships instead issue awards such as \"Best Player\" for each team per game, or the overall best player per position over the course of the tournament.\nUnusual selections.\nThe three star selections for a game, being a \"fun\" statistic, do not ordinarily affect any other aspect of the game. As such, there have been instances in which the three stars have been awarded in an unexpected way, often to recognize a single player's accomplishments.\nOn occasion, a player has been awarded all three stars, or a star has been given to non-players, such as the crowd in attendance.\nTo honor his final game as the long-time broadcaster for the Chicago Blackhawks, Pat Foley was named the number one star of the Hawks' game against San Jose on April 14, 2022."

The former UCC and Cork Constitution player made the move from Munster and played for three years at the highest level in England, making his name in the English Premiership with Harlequins.\nFollowing a move to Leinster, he featured in a number of Ireland squads and lined out for the Wolfhounds, as well as making his debut for the National team on the 2009 Summer tour to Canada and the USA. Ross later made his Six Nations debut in 2011 against Italy. Following that, he was a mainstay on the Irish team until 2016. His scrummaging was widely regarded as key to Leinster's Heineken Cup &amp; Ireland's World Cup progression to the Quarter Final in 2011.\nClub career.\nAfter starting his rugby career with Munster, Ross spent three years with Harlequins in England before signing for Leinster in 2009. The move back to Irish rugby was seen as a move to bolster his playing opportunities to play international rugby with Ireland. He scored his first ever professional try on 5 April 2013, in an Amlin Challenge Cup Quarter Final victory away to London Wasps.\nAfter a career that has seen him win two Six Nations titles, represent Ireland at two World Cups as well as winning two Heineken Cups, a Challenge Cup and two PRO12 titles with Leinster, Ross confirmed that he would retire from rugby at the end of the 2016–17 season.\nInternational career.\nOn 23 May 2009, Ross made his debut for Ireland against Canada in Vancouver, coming on as a replacement in a 25–6 win. He made his first start in the game against the USA on 31 May. Ross made his Six Nations debut when he was given the responsibility of leading the scrum against the Italians on 5 February 2011."

The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and Moscow, with the first winning 3–2. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.\nIn the Soviet Union.\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and Leningrad (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the Black Sea Fleet, Baltic Fleet and Caspian Flotilla further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among sailors. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1925, physical culture has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and Kyiv, the tournament featured teams from the Caucasus, Crimea, Ural, as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the FINA. The national water polo then debuted at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Helsinki.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nRoster for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nUnder-20 team.\nRussia's women have won three titles at the FINA Junior Water Polo World Championships, including back-to-back titles at the 2017 and 2019 events.

        "text": "The Temple Owls men's basketball team represents Temple University in the sport of basketball. The Owls compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). They play their home games in the Liacouras Center on the university's main campus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and are currently led by head coach Adam Fisher. Temple is the sixth-most winningest NCAA Division I men's college basketball program of all time, with 1,978 wins at the end of the 2022–23 season. Although they have reached the NCAA Tournament over thirty times, they are one of nine programs with that many appearances to have not won the Tournament and one of four to have never reached the National Championship Game.\nOn March 7, 2012, the Temple Owls announced that they would be rejoining the Big East Conference for all sports in 2013 after 31 years in the Atlantic 10 Conference, with the Owls football team membership beginning in the 2012 season. However, before Temple became an all-sports member of the Big East, the conference split along football lines. The league's non-FBS football schools formed a new Big East in 2013, while Temple and the remaining football members remained in the old conference, but renamed it the American Athletic Conference.\nHistory.\nThe Temple Owls became the first National Invitation Tournament (NIT) champions in 1938, one year before the inception of the NCAA Tournament. The NIT was broadly recognized as a National Championship awarding tournament for a number of years, beginning with the 1938 National Championship by Temple. Additionally, the Owls were retroactively recognized by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll and the Helms Athletic Foundation as the national champion for the 1937–38 season. Temple again won the NIT championship in 1969.\nDuring the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances in (1956, 1958) under head coach Harry Litwack. Litwack was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.\nHead Coach John Chaney, also a Hall of Famer, won a total of 741 career games (312 losses) and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times in 24 seasons with the Owls. His teams won the Atlantic 10 regular season championship eight times, while winning the A-10 Tournament six times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 1 in the country, but lost in the Elite Eight to Duke. Chaney reached the Elite Eight on five occasions and was the consensus National Coach of the Year in 1988. On March 13, 2006, Chaney retired from coaching.\nOn April 10, 2006, Penn head coach and La Salle alumnus Fran Dunphy was named the new head coach. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. After struggling his first year, the Owls won the A-10 Tournament for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The Owls received bids to the NCAA Tournament for six straight years under Dunphy (2008–2013). However, the Owls only won a game in the Tournament twice during that time period. Since Temple joined the American Athletic Conference in 2013, the Owls have struggled, making the NCAA Tournament only in 2016 and 2019.\nAfter the 2018 season it was announced that former Owls standout and then-assistant coach Aaron McKie would take over for Dunphy in 2019. \nPlayers Mark Macon, Juan Ignacio Sanchez, Eddie Jones, Lavoy Allen, Aaron McKie, Tim Perry and Mardy Collins are just a few who have gone on to play in the NBA.\nRivalries.\nAs a member of the Big 5, the five large colleges in Philadelphia, the Owls have long-standing rivalries with Villanova, Penn, Saint Joseph's, and La Salle. The Owls are tied with Villanova for the most Big 5 titles to date, with 27. However, while tied in overall titles, Villanova has more outright titles not shared by any other tying team. The Owls have not won an outright Big 5 title since the 2000–01 season. The Owls won their most recent Big 5 title in 2022-23, going 3–1 in Big 5 play and splitting the title with Villanova. During Big 5 games, the Temple student section unfurls long banners about the opposing team, which has been a Big 5 trademark for Temple.\nOther rivals include UMass, UConn, and Cincinnati. Temple was in the American Athletic Conference with UConn and Cincinnati until their departures in 2020 and 2023, respectively. When Temple was in the A-10, head coach John Chaney had a personal rivalry with UMass head coach John Calipari.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament 33 times. Their combined record is 33–33.\nNIT results.\nThe Owls have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 19 times. Their combined record is 23–17. They are two time NIT champions (1938, 1969)."

        "text": "Floodlit (day/night) Cricket is cricket played under floodlights at night. The use of floodlights in cricket matches has helped to bring much investment into the game both at a national and an international level since it began in 1977. Today floodlit (day/night) cricket is played in most of the test playing nations although some nations only started hosting day/night matches in the last 10 to 14 years. \nBeginnings of floodlit cricket.\nFloodlit cricket began in Australia when Kerry Packer organised the World Series Cricket competition in the late 1970s for his television company Nine Network. On 28 November 1978 the very first day/night match was played at Adelaide between WSC Australia and the WSC West Indies, a match in which the WSC Australia won by five wickets batting under the floodlights. Very quickly day/night cricket went from strength to strength and even when the WSC ended in 1979 Australia started playing official ODI's under floodlights. The first official floodlit match took place less than one year after the WSC event with Australia again beating the West Indies by five wickets. By 1985 most ODI's in Australia were being played under lights at night. \nDay/night cricket in England and Wales 1997–1999.\nDay/night cricket has been played in England and Wales since July 1997. Since then it has become a major part in the English cricket season with day/night matches played in the NatWest Pro40 League (40 overs), the main competition in which day/night cricket was played alongside day matches but also floodlit matches are played in the Twenty20 Cup (20 overs) and in the Friends Provident Trophy (50 overs) although only grounds which have paramount floodlights and the final of the Twenty20 Cup are day/night matches staged in these competitions. Also England have hosted day/night ODI's (50 overs) at various grounds around England and Wales every season since 2000.\nDay/night cricket in England and Wales started in 1997 when three counties Surrey, Sussex and Warwickshire took the brave step of deciding to each stage one home fixture from the than known AXA Life Sunday League using temporary floodlights. The first official day/night match was due to take place at the Oval on 26 June 1997 between Surrey and Nottinghamshire; however, the match was abandoned due to heavy rain without a ball bowled and so the honour of staging the first day/night cricket match in England and Wales then fell to Edgbaston, which on 23 July 1997 successfully staged a match between Warwickshire and Somerset in front of 16,000 people, a match which Warwickshire won. Sussex successfully staged their first day/night match a month later at Hove against Surrey, a match which Surrey won by 5 wickets in front of a crowd of 4,000 people.\nIn 1998 after the success of the previous season seven counties Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Sussex, Warwickshire and Yorkshire staged day/night matches with a total of 11 played (up 8 on 1997) under lights, with Warwickshire making the decision of playing four home matches under lights and Lancashire staging two home matches at Old Trafford. Trent Bridge, Bristol, Hove, Headingley and The Oval staged one match each. By the 1999 season it became official that day/night cricket was here to stay when Sussex became the first county to install paramount floodlights at their county ground in Hove. Also the advent of the new formed 2 division National League allowed for day/night matches to become a major part of the competition. In 1999 more counties came into line with eleven counties staging games including for the first time Durham, Leicestershire, Somerset and Worcestershire. A total of 20 day/night matches were played, up 9 on 1998.\nDespite the success of it no day/night matches were staged during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.\nDay/night cricket in England and Wales 2000–2005.\nBy 2000 day/night cricket had become commonplace on the County Cricket scene. In 2000 the First One Day International day/night match in England was played under lights at Bristol and also the England Under 19 team also hosted its first day/night match a few weeks later at Hove. Also Derbyshire, Glamorgan and Northamptonshire staged their first home matches under lights. In 2001 Hampshire and Kent staged their first home day/night matches as did Essex however their first floodlit match was staged at Colchester which as of 2008 is the only out ground in England and Wales to have staged official day/night matches. By 2002 all but one (Middlesex) of the first class counties had staged a National League game under lights at their county grounds.\nBetween 1997 and 2002 day/night cricket between the First Class Counties was only played in the Sunday/National League however in the 2003 season day/night cricket in England and Wales took its next major turn. In May of that year Essex became the second county to install paramount floodlights at their ground in Chelmsford who until than had staged all of their floodlit matches at Colchester. In June 2003 the Twenty20 Cup kicked off with Essex and Sussex deciding to each play 2 of their home matches under their lights. No other counties staged group matches under lights. This was the first time that day/night cricket in England had been played between any two counties outside of the National League and on 19 July 2003 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham Surrey Lions won not only the Twenty20 Cup for the first time but also won the very first domestic cup final to be played under floodlights. In 2004 Derbyshire became the third County to install paramount floodlights at their ground in Derby and also the number of day/night games in the Twenty20 Cup in that year increased to 6 matches, up 1 from 2003. Once again apart from the final and the three counties who owned paramount floodlights at that time no other county staged matches under lights. In 2005 the Twenty20 Cup expended from 51 to 79 matches and this caused another increase in the number of day/night games from six matches to ten. Helped in part by Glamorgan who in the same year became the fourth county to install paramount floodlights at their county ground in Cardiff, once again in 2005 day/night matches in the Twenty20 Cup were limited to the final and the four counties that owned paramount floodlights.\nDay/night cricket in England and Wales 2006–.\nIn 2006 One Day Cricket in England was given a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for day/night cricket in England. For the first time day/night matches were played in the C&amp;G Trophy although as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl. Also 2006 saw the launch of the NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed to home and away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced because the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 but for one thing. On 10 September 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord's finally got to stage its first game under floodlights with a match between Middlesex and Derbyshire, a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.\nIn the 2008 Season a total of 55 cricket matches will be played under floodlights in England and Wales, seven in the Friends Provident Trophy, nineteen in the Twenty20 Cup, twenty three in the NatWest Pro40 League and 2 matches in the Twenty20 Floodlit Cup. Also England will play three One Day Internationals under lights at Cardiff, Headingley and at Trent Bridge which will also became the sixth ground in England and Wales to have paramount floodlights and the England Under 19 Team will play one match under lights at Hove and Lord's will stage its second floodlit match in August.\nIn 2011, Kent hosted the first competitive County Championship match to be played under floodlights at their St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury against Glamorgan.\nODI day/night cricket in England and Wales.\nOne Day International day/night cricket has been played in England since 2000 however its development in England and Wales has been very limited because until 2005 none of England's One Day Grounds had paramount floodlights and so temporary lights had to be used. The very first One Day International to be played under floodlights in England was on 6 July 2000 between Zimbabwe and the West Indies in front of 7,000 people at Gloucestershire's County Ground at Bristol, a match which the Zimbabwe won by six wickets. England played their home match under lights a week later at Trent Bridge, a match in which they romped to victory against Zimbabwe and the match was over at 7.30 pm and the lights were barely needed. In 2006 Glamorgan's County Ground in Cardiff staged the first ODI day/night match to be played in Wales and also became the first ODI in England and Wales to be played under paramount floodlights. Since 2000 there has never been more than three ODI's played under lights in England and Wales in the same year however in 2009 England will host four day/night ODI's against Australia which marks the first increase in the number of ODI's to be played in England under floodlights due to Trent Bridge installing paramount floodlights. As of May 2008 only two of England one day grounds have paramount floodlights, the Rose Bowl and Cardiff however Trent Bridge will become the third in August 2008 and when day/night matches are held away from these grounds temporary lights have to be used.\nIn the 2008 Season England will play three One Day Internationals under lights at home against South Africa at Cardiff and Headingley and Trent Bridge.\nIn the following is a list of the Grounds in England and Wales that have staged day/night ODI's since 2000\nGrounds and floodlights.\nAs of 2008 only a third of the eighteen first-class counties in the whole of England and Wales have Paramount Floodlights at their home grounds. Because of this the other counties have to use temporary floodlights which are brought in by road when they stage their floodlit matches at home and because of this (as well as the cost) most, especially the smaller counties only host one floodlit match per year in the NatWest Pro40 League and apart from their home Twenty20 Cup matches it is often seen as the main event of the cricketing season at their grounds with higher than average attendances often recorded depending that the weather is fair.\nIn August 2008 Nottinghamshire will become the sixth county in England and Wales to use paramount floodlights at their county ground which for the first time will be used in an ODI between England and South Africa.\nIn the following is a list of the County Grounds which have paramount floodlights along with the year in which they were installed.\nOver the winter in preparation for the 2009 Cricket Season both Lord's and The Oval also had permanent floodlights installed. Both these grounds have telescopic floodlights which can move upwards when required to light up the playing surface. Northamptonshire also installed permanent floodlights at their Wantage Road ground for the 2010 season. This took the total number of counties to have floodlights at their grounds to nine, exactly half of the 18 counties. Kent also installed permanent telescopic floodlights at their Canterbury ground in time for the 2011 cricket season. Durham and Yorkshire installed lights at the Riverside and Headingley for the 2015 season\nBoth Leicestershire at their Grace Road ground and Gloucestershire at their Nevil Road ground installed floodlights in time for the 2016 season. Both grounds used the lights for the first time for matches in the T20 Blast competition on Friday 20 May 2016. With Somerset also having received planning permission for floodlights to be installed at their Taunton ground this only leaves Worcestershire as the only county not to have permanent floodlights at their home ground.\nEngland v West Indies (First day/night Test Match).\nOn 17 August 2017 Edgbaston played host to the first ever day/night Test match in England and only the fifth to be played worldwide between England and the West Indies with the just the first out of the three planned test matches being played under the lights using the pink ball. Play started at 14:00 BST with the scheduled close of play at 21:00 BST.\n1st Test.\nAll Timings are BST\nMatch Timings\n1st session: 2.00pm – 4.00pm,\nLunch: 4.00pm – 4.40pm,\n2nd session: 4.40pm – 6.40pm,\nTea: 6.40pm – 7.00pm,\n3rd session: 7.00pm – 9.00pm.\nDay/night match timings.\nOver the years, match timings for day/night games in both the Sunday/National League and the Twenty20 Cup have changed. In July 1997 in the very first day/night match at Edgbaston play did not start on that night until 6.10 pm with play not finishing until 11.38 pm which brought about complaints from locals. These days matches apart from the Twenty20 Cup start in the mid-to-late Afternoon at either 2.30 pm for Friends Provident Trophy and One Day International matches with Pro40 matches starting a bit later at 4.40 pm with matches finishing at around 10.15 pm to 10.20 pm. Day/night Twenty20 Cup match start and finish times have also changed over the last few years. In 2003, matches started at 7.30 pm and finished at 10.15 pm. In 2006, timings were brought forward with the matches starting at 7 pm with the match finishing at 9.45 pm.\nHere are the match timings for the 2008 Season.\nAll timings are BST\nNatWest Pro40 League (40 overs)\n1st Innings: 4.40pm – 7.20pm,\nInterval: 7.20pm – 7.40pm,\n2nd Innings: 7.40pm – 10.20pm\nFriends Provident Trophy (50 overs)\n1st Innings: 2.30pm – 6.00pm,\nInterval: 6.00pm – 6.45pm,\n2nd Innings: 6.45pm – 10.15pm\nTwenty20 Cup (20 overs) (group stage and quarterfinals)\n1st Innings: 7.00pm – 8.15pm,\nInterval: 8.15pm – 8.30pm,\n2nd Innings: 8.30pm – 9.45pm\nTwenty20 Cup Final\n1st Innings: 7.15pm – 8.30pm,\nInterval: 8.30pm – 8.45pm,\n2nd Innings: 8.45pm – 10.00pm\nOne Day Internationals (50 overs)\n1st Innings: 2.30pm – 6.00pm,\nInterval: 6.00pm – 6.45pm,\n2nd Innings: 6.45pm – 10.15pm"

        "text": "The 2008 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the fourth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, governed by FIFA. Overall, this was the 14th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995–2004 but was not governed by FIFA. It took place in Marseille, France, in the Plages du Prado from 17 to 27 July 2008. It was the first tournament to take place outside Brazil.\nThe winners of the tournament were Brazil, who won their third consecutive FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup title and their twelfth title overall.\nQualifying rounds.\nAfrica.\nThe qualifiers to determine the two African nations who would play in the World Cup took place in Durban, South Africa for the third year running between March 25 and March 30.

The hosts, the United Arab Emirates qualified for the second time after beating Japan in the final of the championship, 4-3, for the second consecutive year. Iran beat China in the third place play off to claim the third berth at the World Cup for the third year in a row.\nEurope.\nFor the first time since the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup qualifiers began in 2006, due to the large interest of European nations in beach soccer, UEFA held a tournament dedicated to World Cup qualification in Benidorm, Spain, between, May 11 and May 18, instead of allowing European nations to qualify to the World Cup through the Euro Beach Soccer League. Hosts Spain won the championship, with neighbours Portugal finishing second. Russia beat Italy in the third place play off, but regardless of the result, both teams qualified to the World Cup, along with the finalists.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean Zone.\nThe North, Central America and the Caribbean Zone qualifiers took place between April 17 and April 19 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between Australia and England",
        "text": "The rivalry between the England and Australia national rugby union teams started on 9 January 1909 at Blackheath's Rectory Field in England, during the 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, dubbed the 1st Wallabies. The Wallabies won the match 9–3. The two nations next met in 1928, at Twickenham, during the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada and England won 18–11. After the 1939–40 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II, twenty years passed before England and Australia next met, again at Twickenham, with Australia winning the 1948 test 11–0. It would then be another decade until the two nations played another test against one another. In 1958, they met again at Twickenham, and England won 9–6.\nEngland and Australia played each other twice during the 1960s, first in 1963, when the Wallabies defeated England 18–9 at Sydney's Sports Ground, during England’s first tour overseas. They met again in 1967 during the 1966–67 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France and Australia triumphed 23–11 at Twickenham. The nations played each other another four times during the 1970s; with England winning 20–3 at Twickenham in 1973, Australia winning 16–9 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1975 and again one week later 30–21 at Ballymore during the 1975 England rugby union tour of Australia, and England winning in 1976, 23–6 at Twickenham, as part of the 1975–76 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and the United States.\nThe two nations would meet six times during the 1980s, the first encounter was in 1982, during the 1981–82 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland with England defeating Australia 15–11 at Twickenham. Two years later the Wallabies were victorious at Twickenham, winning 19–3 on their way to winning their first and up to now only Grand Slam. The next match was a pool match in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup at Sydney's Concord Oval in 1987, which Australia won 19–6. The nations played three times in 1988: Australia won 22–16 in Brisbane and 28–8 at the Concord Oval, during the 1988 England rugby union tour of Australia and Fiji with England winning the third and final match at Twickenham 28–19.\nThe sides met three times during the 1990s before the end of the amateur era and the introduction of the Cook Cup. The first match was in 1991 at the Sydney Football Stadium, won 40–15 by Australia. The next match was the 1991 Rugby World Cup Final at Twickenham, which the Wallabies won 12–6. with Tony Daly scoring the only try of the game. The last pre-Cook Cup match was a quarter-final tie at the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, played at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town. England won 25–22, thanks to a last-minute drop goal by Rob Andrew. \nCook Cup and Ella-Mobbs Trophy (since 1997).\nThe Cook Cup came about at the start of Rugby Union's professional era, when the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) agreed to play each other on a home-and-away basis. The first Cook Cup match was played at the Sydney Football Stadium on 25 June 1997. Australia won the match 25–6. The series was however to be decided through two tests, and the second took place at Twickenham in London, this resulted in a 15–15 draw. Since Australia won the first test, they were crowned champions.\nIn 1998 Australia ran out 76-0 winners at Lang Park in Brisbane. The Wallabies were captained by John Eales, and in total, Australia scored 11 tries against a weakened England side. The subsequent meeting at Twickenham saw England lose by just one point, the score being 12–11. In 1999, the Cook Cup was decided through one match rather than two, as the 1999 Rugby World Cup meant that there was no space in the schedule for a November test match between the countries. Australia defeated England 22–15 at Stadium Australia. In 2000, the Cook Cup was again contested over a single match, due to the 2001 British Lions tour to Australia, and for the first time saw England and Australia meet as reigning champions of their respective hemispheres. The match was played at Twickenham, and England won 22–19 to win the Cook Cup for the first time.\nThe single-test format remained for 2002, and England successfully defended the Cook Cup by beating Australia 32–31 at Twickenham. In 2003, the Cook Cup was again decided over one match, owing to the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The match was played at Melbourne's Telstra Dome, and England won 25–14, marking their first ever victory over Australia on Australian soil. Later that year, England repeated the feat when the two nations met in what is arguably their most famous encounter, at the 2003 World Cup final. Jonny Wilkinson landed a drop goal in extra time that saw England win the Rugby World Cup 20–17.\nThe 2004 Cook Cup was contested over two matches. The first post-World Cup edition of the challenge saw Australia beat England in Brisbane in June and then again in London in November to reclaim the Cook Cup for the first time since 1999. The 2005 Cook Cup was contested over a single test, which England won 26–16 at Twickenham. In June 2006 the countries played a two-match test series in Australia, with the home team winning both matches to regain the Cup.\nThe Cook Cup has been contested nearly every year since, with the exception of the World Cup years (2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019). Australia retained the cup in 2008, 2009 and the mid-year tests of 2010, before England regained it in the 2010 end-of-year tests. Australia regained the cup in 2012, but since then England have dominated the series, winning it outright in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021 and 2022. The match scheduled for Twickenham in November 2020 did not take place, making 2020 the first non-World Cup year this century in which the Cook Cup has not been contested. \nThe Cook Cup was renamed the Ella-Mobbs Trophy from the July 2022 series.\nSince 1909, England and Australia have played each other 55 times. England lead the series by 28 wins to 26, with one match drawn.\nList of series.\n "

        "text": "David George Baldwin (born March 30, 1938) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.\nLife and career.\nBorn in Tucson, Arizona, on March 30, 1938, Baldwin pitched for three years for the University of Arizona. In the 1959 College World Series, he beat Fresno State 5 to 1 on a two-hitter and lost the final game of the series 5 to 3 to Oklahoma State. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1959 and pitched on three pennant winners in his first four years of pro ball.\nLater, he was a relief specialist for the Washington Senators (1966–69), Milwaukee Brewers (1970), and Chicago White Sox (1973). In 176 games he compiled a record of 6 wins and 11 losses, with 23 saves and an ERA of 3.08. The combined batting average of opponents against him was .234 In 1967, he ranked 3rd in the American League and 5th in the major leagues (of pitchers with 10 or more appearances) with an ERA of 1.70. That season he ranked 5th in the American League for relief runs saved (11.8), ranked 7th in saves (12), and ranked 9th in pitching appearances (58). In 1970, Baldwin led major league pitchers in range factor per nine innings (a measure of fielding proficiency) with a value of 5.094, the seventh highest value ever compiled.\nIn 1974, Baldwin, at age 36, was the second oldest player in both the Pacific Coast League and the American Association. Baldwin did not commit an error during his six-year major league career, handling 64 total chances (15 putouts, 49 assists) and committed only three errors throughout the 16 years he played professional baseball.\nAfter he retired from baseball in 1974 he earned a Ph.D. in genetics and an M.S. in systems engineering from the University of Arizona. He worked as a geneticist, engineer, and artist until his retirement in 2003. Subsequently, he has collaborated with other researchers studying the physics, physiology, and psychology of baseball. In addition, he has published his baseball memoir, \"Snake Jazz\", and (under the pen name \"DGB Featherkile\") a collection of his poetry, \"Limbic Hurly-Burly\". Many of his poems have appeared in such journals as \"American Poetry Journal\", \"Blue Unicorn\", and \"Evansville Review\". His poetry won the \"Atlanta Review\"'s 2007 International Publication Prize and the 2009 Fluvanna Prize from The Lyric.\nBaldwin's painting \"Fugue for the Pepper Players\" is in the collection of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and was featured in \"Treasures of the Baseball Hall of Fame\" by John Thorn (1998) pp. 188–189.\nBaldwin has been inducted into the University of Arizona Sports Hall of Fame (class of 2015) and the Pima County, Arizona, Sports Hall of Fame (class of 2011). He received the Professional Achievement Award from the University of Arizona Alumni Association in 2009."

        "title": "Vanderbilt Commodores baseball",
        "text": "The Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team is an American National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college baseball team from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The team participates in the Eastern division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and plays its home games on campus at Hawkins Field. The Commodores are coached by three-time National Coach of the Year and three-time SEC Coach of the Year, Tim Corbin. During Corbin's tenure as head coach, Vanderbilt has become one of the premier college baseball programs in the United States, responsible for 19 first-round picks in the MLB draft.\nHistory.\nVanderbilt first fielded a baseball team in 1886. Herbert Charles Sanborn, the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology from 1921 to 1942, who was also the president of the Nashville German-American Society, coached the team in 1912–1913. Baseball became a scholarship sport in 1968.\nThe Commodores secured only three NCAA appearances in the 20th century—in 1973, 1974, and 1980. They had only three other winning seasons in SEC play in the first 35 years of the scholarship era. However, they have been to every NCAA tournament but one since 2004. The team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to \"Baseball America\", made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and SEC tournament crowns. The Commodores were ranked first in most polls for a majority of the 2007 season and earned the #1 national seed for the 2007 NCAA tournament. Vanderbilt's victory over the University of Virginia in the finals of the 2014 NCAA tournament marks the program's first national title and second appearance in the College World Series, having first appeared in 2011. In 2019, Vanderbilt's fourth College World Series appearance, they beat Michigan two games to one in the finals, winning their second national title.\nStadium.\nThe original venue for the Commodores ball club was Dudley Field. Currently, the Commodores play their home games at Hawkins Field, which is an on-campus facility with a 3,700 seat capacity. Temporary outfield bleachers were installed for the 2007 Regionals and all of the 2008 season, bringing the capacity to 3,535. In May 2008, Vanderbilt announced extensive plans to upgrade its athletic facilities, including the addition of permanent seats down the first base line and outfield seats in both left-center and right field. These additions increased the size of Hawkins Field to its current capacity of 3,700 seats. It is adjacent to both Vanderbilt Stadium and Memorial Gymnasium and is across the street from the McGugin Center. Hawkins Field opened in 2002 and is named after a donor who gave $2 million to help finance construction. The stadium was also the site of the first NCAA Baseball Tournament Regional that Vanderbilt ever hosted when it was the site of the Nashville Regional in 2007. Vanderbilt and Hawkins Field again hosted Regionals in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023 along with hosting Super Regionals in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2021.\nYear-by-year results.\nRecords taken from the 2011 Vanderbilt baseball media guide.In 1997, Vanderbilt forfeited 30 games due to an ineligible player.\n√ Vanderbilt forfeited 30 games due to Hunter Bledsoe being ineligible player.\nConference championships.\nVanderbilt has won 10 conference season championships, 4 conference tournament championships, and 9 conference division championships."

        "text": "The Tulane Green Wave baseball team represents Tulane University in NCAA Division I college baseball. The Green Wave baseball team competes in the American Athletic Conference and play their home games on campus at Greer Field at Turchin Stadium. They are coached by head coach Jay Uhlman.\nTulane has captured 16 conference championships in three\ndifferent leagues and have made 22 NCAA Regional Appearances, including three Super Regionals and two trips to the Men's College World Series.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1893–1946).\nTulane played its first game during the 1893 season. It was a 10–2 victory over the Southern Athletic Club.\nEarly Modern era (1947–1974).\nDuring this era, Tulane won the 1948 SEC championship. Tulane left the SEC after the 1966 season. The school's final SEC season marked a milestone in racial integration in the South when Stephen Martin, a walk-on who was attending the school on an academic scholarship, became the first African American to play any varsity sport in the SEC.\nJoe Brockhoff era (1975–1993).\nUnder Joe Brockhoff, Tulane made seven NCAA tournament appearances. His teams won one regular season and three tournament Metro Conference championships. Brockhoff finished with an overall record of 641–350–2 (.647) in his 19 seasons as head baseball coach.\nRick Jones era (1994–2014).\nRick Jones was hired as head baseball coach at Tulane in 1994. In 1996, Tulane played its first season as a founding member of Conference USA.\nIn 2001, the team's 55 wins set a school record and led the nation. The team made it to the College World Series in Omaha, only to blow an 8–0 lead against Stanford University and lose the game 13–11. The Green Wave won its next game against Nebraska 6–5 but was eliminated in the third game by Cal State Fullerton.\nIn 2005, the Green Wave tied its 2001 record for wins. Tulane started the season ranked first in the nation and held the top spot throughout most of the regular season. The Green Wave entered the postseason ranked No. 1 and beat Rice to win its Super Regional. Tulane advanced to the College World Series for the second time in school history. The Green Wave defeated Oregon State 3–1 in its first game but fell 5–0 to Texas, the eventual national champion. In an elimination game against Baylor, the Green Wave led 7–0 in the 7th inning before the Bears scored 8 runs in the final three innings to win the game. Brian Bogusevic won Louisiana Pitcher of the Year, was named to four All-American teams (including Louisville Slugger's first team), and was a semifinalist for three national awards. He was taken in the first round of the 2005 draft by the Houston Astros. Pitcher and first baseman Micah Owings was named Conference USA and Louisiana Player of the Year. He was drafted in the third round by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Third baseman Brad Emaus was named Conference USA and Louisiana Freshman of the Year. Head Coach Rick Jones was named Louisiana Coach of the Year.\nIn 2006, the Tulane baseball team returned to New Orleans after spending the fall semester at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. With the renovation of Turchin Stadium delayed, the Green Wave were forced to play home games at nearby Zephyr Field for 2 seasons. Despite the distractions and disruptions of their day-to-day lives, the Green Wave finished the regular season 39–17, in third place in C-USA with a 15–9 conference record. Tulane lost to Ole Miss in the NCAA Regionals to end the season.\nThe university's Renewal Plan called for the suspension of some of its sports, and Tulane Athletics did not return to a full 16 teams until the 2011–12 school year.\nPrior to the 2007 season the Green Wave was recognized by \"Baseball America\" as one of the top college baseball programs in the country since the NCAA expanded its tournament from 48 to 64 teams. The ratings were formulated by evaluating a program's national impact, overall competitiveness, fans and facilities, and academics. The Wave received an \"A\" rating, one of only 16 teams so designated.\nThe 2007 season saw the long-term effects of Hurricane Katrina finally wear on the team. With construction underway on the new Turchin Stadium, the Wave played a second straight season at Zephyr Field. A solid 28–11 start to the season (including a sweep of in-state rival LSU) was followed by a 6–15 limp to the finish line. The Green Wave failed to garner an NCAA bid for the first time since 1997.\nIn 2010, the NCAA named Tulane the 17th winningest team of the 2000s in terms of winning percentage and 16th by overall wins.\nDue to health concerns in his 21st season as head coach, Rick Jones stepped down temporarily, handing over control of the 2014 team to recruiting coordinator and hitting coach Jake Gautreau. He was replaced by David Pierce. Jones finished with an overall record of 726–401–2 (.644) during his tenure as head coach for the Green Wave.\nDavid Pierce era (2015–2016).\nIn his first year at Tulane in 2015, David Pierce brought the Green Wave back to postseason play for the first time since 2008. In 2016, he improved on that and Tulane won the American Athletic Conference championship. On June 29, 2016, Pierce left the Green Wave baseball program for the Texas Longhorns. He was only the third coach to lead Tulane to an NCAA appearance.\nTravis Jewett era (2017–2022).\nOn July 14, 2016, Tulane hired Travis Jewett as head coach after a previous stint as an assistant coach at Vanderbilt.\nOn May 16, 2022, Tulane and Jewett agreed to mutually part ways effective immediately. Jay Uhlman was named interim head coach.\nJay Uhlman era (2022-present).\nOn June 7, 2022, Tulane hired Jay Uhlman as head coach. He led Tulane back to the NCAA Regionals for the first time since 2016, joining Rick Jones and David Pierce as the only coaches to do so in their first seasons at Tulane. The Wave did it in unconventional fashion going 15-39 in the regular season but won the American Athletic Conference Tournament (first since 2005) over East Carolina to make the NCAA tournament in Baton Rouge. He is only the 4th coach in Tulane history to take his team to the NCAA Tournament.\nTraditions.\nLogo and uniforms.\nTulane Baseball is widely regarded year in and year out as having one of the best logos and uniforms in college baseball. Their jerseys feature two pelicans, Louisiana's state bird, perched on a baseball bat in the style of the St. Louis Cardinals logo. Throughout the years, multiple publications and fans have voted the Green Wave jerseys as having the #1 Logo and Uniform in college baseball, and as recently as 2016 the NCAA named it one of the top nine in the country.\nTulane's \"birds on the bat\" logo pays homage to the New Orleans Pelicans, a former minor league baseball team in New Orleans whose logo also borrowed from their parent club, the St. Louis Cardinals.\nTulane has worn multiple color combinations throughout the years that include the following: olive green, sky blue, cream, white, gray, black, and padre style camo jerseys, all donning the famous Tulane \"birds on the bat\" logo. The baseball cap insignia features either the school's \"Angry Wave\" logo or the \"Slugger Bird\".\nStadium.\nThe Green Wave have played its home games at Greer Field at Turchin Stadium since 1991. The team has a .750 winning percentage in games played there and consistently ranks highly among Division I baseball programs in average attendance figures. In 2008 the Green Wave returned to a brand-new Greer Field at Turchin Stadium, nearly rebuilt at the site of the old stadium after damage from Katrina forced the municipality to go with a much larger construction project. The new stadium expanded seating to 5,000, including four luxury box suites and a partially covered seating area with 2,700 chairback seats.\nNotable players.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Tulane baseball program has retired four numbers in the school's history. One player, a player/coach and two coaching legends each have their names and numbers immortalized inside Greer Field at Turchin Stadium. A trio of New Orleans natives are all enshrined in the Tulane Athletics Hall of Fame, with head coach Joe Brockhoff (East Jefferson High School), Cary D. Livingston (West Jefferson High School) and Milt Retif (Jesuit High School) all have their numbers hung on the facade inside the Green Wave's home stadium. The latest honoree was former Georgia Tech assistant Rick Jones who created an Omaha pedigree program during his tenure at Tulane. He took the 2001 and 2005 teams to Omaha, once as the number one overall national seed. \nOther prominent former players.\nAndrew Friedman\nBobby Brown\nScott Sidwell\nCollegiate national team members.\nOver the last two decades, the Green Wave have been well represented on the nation's most elite team: USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team. Nine players/coaches have donned the red, white and blue uniform on eight separate occasions since Ivan Zweig became the first to represent Tulane as a member of Team USA in 1991.\n\"**\"Indicates selected to team but did not participate due to injury\nTulane and MLB.\nBy the numbers.\nFront office in MLB"

        "text": "The American Association (AA) was a professional American football minor league based in New York City. Founded in 1936 with teams in New York and New Jersey, the AA extended its reach to Providence, Rhode Island prior to the onset of World War II. After a four-year hiatus, the league was renamed the American Football League as it expanded to include teams in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1947, the Richmond Rebels of the Dixie League purchased the assets of the defunct AFL Long Island Indians and jumped leagues (causing the demise of the DL).\nThe American Association was the first minor football league with a working arrangement with the National Football League as a system of farm clubs, beginning with the purchase of the Stapleton Buffaloes (which played one game as the New York Tigers) by New York Giants owner Tim Mara in 1937.\nIn the late 1930s and 1940s, the league enjoyed popularity comparable to that of the more established National Football League (NFL) of 1920/1922, despite being in direct competition. In 1949 and 1950, the league was adversely affected by instability of membership. After starting its last season with six teams, only two league members survived to the end of the year.\nThe Atlantic Coast Football League originally established itself in several former American Association markets (reviving some of the team names as well) and hiring the same president, Joe Rosentover, when it began play in 1962.\nOrigin of league.\nThe American Association was formed after a proposal by Edwin Simandl, manager of the Orange Tornadoes football team. Members of the defunct Eastern League (1932) and Interstate League (1933) became charter members of the new AA as the owner of the Passaic Red Devils, Joe Rosentover, became the league's president. The original lineup consisted of four teams from New York (Mt. Vernon Cardinals, Brooklyn Bay Parkways, New Rochelle Bulldogs, and White Plains Bears) and four from New Jersey (Orange Tornadoes, Paterson Panthers, Passaic Red Devils, and Stapleton Buffaloes, the last of which consisted mostly of the remains of the defunct Staten Island Stapletons). The formation of the league was announced in June 1936.\nFrom 1936 to 1937, there was at least one \"groupie\" team that never joined the league, but played the bulk of its games against AA franchises: the Harlem Brown Bombers, a barnstorming/traveling team that consisted entirely of black players and was coached by Fritz Pollard, played seven games against AA teams over two years, compiling a 1-4-1 record.\nAmerican Association (1936–1941).\n1936.\nWhile the league did not have official divisions, several sources show the membership divided into a “New York Division” (NY) and a “New Jersey Division” (NJ). Teams are ranked by win percentage.\nPlayoffs: Brooklyn 18, New Rochelle 0; Paterson 10, Orange 0 (Mt. Vernon declined to participate in playoffs)\nChampionship: Brooklyn wins title after Paterson withdraws (Paterson stays in the league)\nIn the first game of a series between the AA champion and the winners of the Dixie League, the Washington Pros (Dixie League) defeated the Brooklyn Bay Parkways (American Association) 13-6 in Richmond, Virginia, January 1, 1937. It was the last time that an American Association team lost to a team in the Dixie League in a football game.\n1937.\nPassaic dropped out due to stadium issues and was replaced by the Brooklyn Bushwicks and the Danbury Trojans; the Brooklyn Bay Parkways were renamed the Brooklyn Eagles (remiscent of the iconic daily newspaper in the borough, the \"Brooklyn Eagle\"); the Orange Tornadoes moved to Newark, New Jersey; and the Stapleton Buffaloes officially \"moved\" to Manhattan to become the New York Tigers, a traveling team that lasted only one game. Although Passaic dropped out, owner Rosentover continued serving as A.A. president, a position he would hold for another 13 years, until the dissolution of the league.\nWhile the league was \"unofficially divided\" into two divisions in its first year, the realigned American Association was put into two official divisions for 1937: a Northern and a Southern division. For the 1937 season only, standings were based on two points per win and one point per tie.\nPoint totals do not include 1-0 forfeit scores.\nThe 1937 championship game matched the Newark Tornadoes against the White Plains Bears, which ended in a 3-3 tie. Newark suggested an extra period to end the game, with the blessing of the league commissioner provided that White Plains agreed, but the Bears refused and the title was shared. \nSouthern Division.\nChampionship: Newark 3, Paterson 3 (co-champions declared when Paterson refused to play the suggested overtime period)\n1938.\nGone were Mt. Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains; the Clifton Wessingtons received the rights to White Plains' 1937 team and joined the AA for 1938; and the Brooklyn Bushwicks moved to Union City, New Jersey, and became the Rams. Tim Mara, New York Giants owner, purchased the Stapleton franchise, moved it to Jersey City, New Jersey, and made it the first farm team in professional football. Bill Owen, brother of Steve Owen, managed the team. A number of former New York Giant players were on the New Jersey team, including Ken Strong, who was barred from the NFL club until 1939 after defecting to the New York Yankees of the second American Football League in 1936.\nIn the lineup of the Brooklyn Eagles was a reserve guard who eventually made his mark as a head coach: Vince Lombardi. The Clifton Wessingtons featured tailback Joe Lillard, the last African American NFL player before the imposition of a color line in 1936.\nDown to seven teams, the league decided to scrap the divisional alignment for 1938. In addition, there were no plans for championship playoffs: the championship was determined strictly by winning percentage (ignoring tie games).\nNo playoffs: Jersey City was declared league champions\n1939.\nA year after Tim Mara bought the Jersey City Giants and used it as a farm team for his New York Giants NFL franchise, the AA underwent more change in 1939. Gone was Clifton, but the league returned to a two-division, eight team format as the Wilmington Clippers and the Providence Steamroller (independent teams in 1937 and 1938) joined the AA. Chicago Bears owner George Halas purchased the Newark Tornadoes and renamed them the Bears (Wilmington protested the Bears' use of Sid Luckman in a playoff game, which the Bears won, 13-6, to win the Southern Division title).\nSouthern Division.\nChampionship: Newark 27, Paterson 7\n1940.\nBrooklyn, Danbury, and Union City dropped out in the offseason; the Long Island Indians join the league for the 1940 season... and was promptly raided by members of the new American Football League and lost four starters. The rest of the American Association was similarly hurt by defections to the new league (the Boston Shamrocks, champions of the AFL in both 1940 and 1941, got the bulk of its roster by raiding the Indians and the Steamroller).\nBack to only six teams, the AA instituted a Shaughnessy playoff system, with the fourth-place team facing the first-place team and the second- and third-place teams meeting in semifinal matches, with the winners facing each other in a championship game.\nStandings include two forfeits by Providence; the point totals do not. Providence dropped out of the league November 12, 1940, but was expected to return for the 1941 season.\nPlayoffs: Newark and Long Island tied for the last playoff spot. The two teams played to a 0-0 tie on December 1, 1940. A rematch scheduled for December 5 was cancelled due to snow; the league broke the tie with a best three-of-five coin toss, which Newark won to enter the playoffs.\nSemifinal games: Jersey City 7, Newark 6; Wilmington 11, Paterson 8\nChampionship: Jersey City 17, Wilmington 7\n1941.\nWhile Tim Mara sold the Jersey City Giants, the team was sold to the owners of the N.F.L.'s Cleveland Rams, setting off a sequence of arrangements that tied the membership of the AA (except Providence) with the NFL. The raiding of the AA by the AFL continued, with Wilmington and Providence being particularly hard hit. The Steamroller's loss of seven players forced the team to drop out of the league. The A.A. found a replacement team with a connection with the AFL: the New York Yankees.\nThe 1941 New York Yankees was not the same team as the 1940 Yankees. The latter was team of the AFL that was sold to Douglas Hertz in late 1940, but the AFL revoked the franchise in August 1941 in response to a financial controversy on the part of Hertz. The team was then sold to a group headed by William Cox (who later became the president of the AFL) as preparations for the new season had begun (under the new regime, the name of the team was changed to the New York Americans). Hertz then formed a new barnstorming team, called it the New York Yankees, and started playing independent teams in the American northeast before accepting the invitation to join the American Association. The team left the League after losing all six of its games and folded after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ushered in the United States' participation in World War II, December 7th, 1941, and making a question in the future temporarily for all professional sports.\nPlayoffs: Wilmington 33, Paterson 0; Long Island 7, Jersey City 6\nChampionship: Wilmington 21, Long Island 13\n1942.\nThe Hartford Blues were expected to replace the New York Yankees for the 1942 season; the Churchill Pros (based in Springfield, Massachusetts) were enlisted to replace Providence when the team became the new Springfield Steamroller.\nAmerican Association president John Rosentover announced in August 1942, that the AA was following the lead of the third American Football League, in that the league was suspending operations due to World War II. \nDespite the absence of the AA, there was an unofficial \"league\" operating in the area - the Northeast Football League, with an informal association of teams that operated since 1940. To the already existing Blues, Steamroller, Wilmington Clippers and Paterson Panthers joined the newly formed Holyoke Golden Bears, Long Island Clippers, New London Diesels and Worcester Panthers. Wilmington considered the best team in the circuit, finishing undefeated with only one tie against Philadelphia Eagles.\nWhile some member teams kept playing on in an informal assemblage, the Northeast circuit did not return in 1943, and the AA remained officially out of action until the post-war year of 1946.\nAmerican Football League (1946–1950).\nIn the autumn of 1945, after the surrender of Japan in World War II, the American Association returned to business, unlike the third American Football League. John Rosentover remained league president, and the five teams that finished the 1941 AA season (Jersey City, Long Island, Newark, Paterson, and Wilmington) returned to the fold, but the two franchises that were supposed to join the league in 1942 (Hartford and Springfield) did not survive the league's layover.\nThe third American Football League, which had originally announced intentions of resuming play after the war, did not survive it either, so the American Association adopted a new name upon resumption of operations: \"American Football League\". The league renewed its working relationship with the old National Football League, of 1920/1922, considered a \"major league\" of pro football. A compact with the Dixie League and the far west's Pacific Coast Professional Football League prohibited the participation of players signed to \"outlaw leagues\" (originally directed toward the third AFL, but, starting 1946, also applied to the newly formed All-America Football Conference of 1946–1949, soon to be involved in major league competition with the old NFL). On March 24, 1946, the formalization of the compact, the Association of Professional Football Leagues as the \"Big Three\" of the minor leagues of pro football in the United States, was announced by PCPFL president (and Association chairman) J. Rufus Klawans.\n1946.\nThe resurrected league had three new entries for the first post-war season: the Scranton Miners, Newark Bombers (replacing the Bears, who moved to Akron, Ohio), and the Bethlehem Bulldogs. As the games resumed, fan attendance returned to prewar levels.\nWestern Division.\nChampionship: Jersey City 14, Akron 13\n1947.\nAkron left the AFL in early 1947, leaving Newark as the Chicago Bears' primary farm team. Newark moved to Bloomfield, New Jersey, and became the Cardinals. Similarly, the Scranton Minors moved to Wilkes-Barre and became the Barons. The league retained its divisional setup despite having only seven teams.\nWestern Division.\nThe Long Island Indians dropped out after three games; they were replaced by the Richmond Rebels, which started the season competing in the Dixie League. The defection reduced the Dixie League to just three members, and another long-standing minor league (founded 1936) folded within a week.\nChampionship: Bethlehem 23, Paterson 7\n1948.\nBloomfield folded before the start of play in 1948 and the league scrapped its two-division setup for the upcoming season. The Shaughnessy playoff system was reinstated.\nBethlehem was crippled by a pair of events prior to play. First, the Philadelphia Eagles ended their working arrangement with the Bulldogs and worked with Paterson instead; second, the league instituted a new rule limiting salaries to $2000 a game per team (in 1947, the Bulldogs averaged $5500 a week). After a 0-4 start blamed in part by salary dissention, owner Bob Sell released seven players. The team barely missed the playoffs despite playing the last six games with a 4-1-1 record.\nIt was the last year that the league had an official working agreement with NFL teams, as the league severed ties with all minor league teams. The last affiliate teams were Paterson Panthers (Eagles), Jersey City Giants and Richmond Rebels (Bears), although some teams kept an informal relationship with their NFL affiliates until the AFL collapsed. \nPlayoffs: Wilmington defeated Richmond; Paterson beat Jersey City \nChampionship: Paterson 24, Wilmington 14\n1949.\nWith the dissolution of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League in 1948, the American Football League (formed as the American Association in 1936) became the sole remaining prewar minor league. Charter member Paterson had not missed a week of league play (except refusing to play the 1936 league championship game), and would not until the end of the league. For the first time since the end of World War II, there were no changes in membership prior to league play in 1949.\nPlayoffs: Richmond 66, Wilmington 0; Paterson 16, Bethlehem 7\nChampionship: Richmond 35, Paterson 14\nAfter winning three games in their first four games, Wilkes-Barre was hit by a rash of injuries in their games with Richmond and Paterson. Bob Edgerson, Bullets president, informed the league that the injuries would force him to cancel an upcoming game with Wilmington. Two days later, league president Joe Rosentover revoked the franchise. Rosentover then asked the independent Erie Vets if they could finish the Bullets' schedule, but the team had disbanded for the season. The last four scheduled Wilkes-Barre games were declared forfeits.\nRichmond owner Harry Seibold applied for an expansion franchise in the All-America Football Conference, which had lost a member when the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers merged for the 1949 season. No action was taken on the application as the AAFC merged with the NFL for the 1950 season. Richmond remained in the AFL.\n1950.\nAlthough the Erie Vets could not complete Wilkes-Barre's schedule in 1949, they did join the AFL for the 1950 season; in addition, the Wilmington Clippers left the league and were replaced by the Brooklyn Brooks. The league made an unsuccessful overture to the Buffalo Bisons (AAFC), who had been rejected when the AAFC and the NFL merged, to have the Bisons join the AFL. The league abandoned the Shaughnessy playoff system and opted to have only the top two finishers play for the championship. It turned out that only two teams were still playing at the end of the season.\nBethlehem called it quits in early October, having lost two games (one by forfeit); later that week, the Brooklyn franchise was revoked for failure to pay the entrance fee. After Joe Rosentover announced the revocation, he announced that the games involving the Bulldogs or the Brooks would not count (they are included below). A new league schedule was drawn up, but in early November, charter member Paterson was forced to close up shop because of a financial dispute.\nLater that month, longtime league member Jersey City Giants (who entered the league in 1938 after its owners purchased the assets of charter member Stapleton Buffaloes) also called it quits after being crushed by each of the other two remaining teams in the league. Thus after nine weeks, Erie and Richmond were the last teams standing.\nIncludes forfeits by Brooklyn and Bethlehem (point totals exclude them); official league records have the games involving Brooklyn and Bethlehem stricken.\nChampionship: Richmond 35, Erie 7\nWith only two teams remaining in the league, this American Football League (the fourth of that name) folded after the championship game."

        "text": "The 2007 Welsh Open was the 2007 edition of the Welsh Open professional snooker tournament and was held from 12 to 18 February 2007 at the Newport Centre in Newport, South East Wales. It was the 16th staging of the competition since 1992 and the tenth time it took place at the Newport Centre. The tournament was the fifth of seven World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) ranking events in the 2006/2007 season. The host broadcasters were BBC Cymru Wales and Eurosport.\nGrand Prix winner Neil Robertson won the tournament, defeating 500–1 outsider Andrew Higginson, who was in only his third appearance in the main stages of a professional competition, nine &lt;dfn&gt;frames&lt;/dfn&gt; to eight (9–8) in the final. It was Roberston's second ranking tournament victory, becoming the fourth non-British and Irish player to win more than one ranking title. Robertson won against Michael Holt and world champions Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Steve Davis en route to the final. Higginson achieved the tournament's highest break with a maximum break in the second frame of his quarter-final match with Ali Carter. The Welsh Open preceded the China Open and followed the Malta Cup.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nThe Welsh Open began as a ranking tournament in 1992 initially in February, occurring after the Masters, but later replaced the Classic in January. The event was sponsored by the cigarette brand Regal until 2003 (known as the Regal Welsh Open), but UK restrictions on tobacco advertising left it unsponsored until 2009. The Welsh Cup was first held at the Newport Centre in Newport in 1992 before it moved to the Cardiff International Arena (now called Motorpoint Arena Cardiff) in 1999. It was held at the Welsh Institute of Sport in 2004 and returned to the Newport Centre in 2005.\nThe 2007 tournament took place at the Newport Centre in Newport, South East Wales between 12 and 18 February. It was the fifth of seven World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) ranking competitions in the 2006/2007 season, following the Malta Cup and preceding the China Open. Held between January and February, the Malta Cup was won by 2005 world champion Shaun Murphy, who defeated Ryan Day by nine frames to four (9–4) in the final. The defending Welsh Open champion from 2006 was Stephen Lee, who defeated Murphy by the same scoreline. The total prize fund was £225,500, and the host broadcasters were BBC Cymru Wales and Eurosport. All matches were best-of-nine frames until the semi-finals.\nTwo-time Welsh Open champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was the pre-tournament favourite to win his third title in Wales. Reigning world champion and world number 2 Graeme Dott spoke of his delight to enter the Welsh Open in contention to top the world rankings but vowed not to lose his concentration, \"If you have big expectations, they can hamper the way you play and create extra pressure. That's the last thing I want.\"\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying rounds were played to the best-of-nine frames between players ranked lower than 32 for one of 16 places in the final stage, at Pontin's Snooker Centre, Prestatyn, Wales from 6 to 8 January 2007. It was contested over three rounds and higher-ranked players received byes to the second and third rounds. Provisional world number 56 Jimmy White narrowly missed out qualifying for the fifth successive tournament of the season with a 5–4 defeat to Mark Allen in the third qualifying round. The successful qualifiers included the 1991 world champion John Parrott, Andrew Higginson, Ricky Walden and Ben Woollaston.\nRound 1.\nThe 16 first-round matches on 12 and 13 February were between players ranked 17–32 and those who had made it through the qualifying stage. In this round Joe Perry came from 2–1 behind with a break of 127 in frame five to defeat Parrott 5–2 after the latter missed a straightforward red ball shot in frame seven, Gerard Greene whitewashed Mark King 5–0, David Gilbert won 5–1 over James Wattana, and Joe Swail defeated Adrian Gunnell by the same scoreline. Woollaston took a surprise 5–1 victory over David Gray as the former World Championship semi-finalist Andy Hicks lost 4–5 to Dave Harold. Breaks of 65, 68, and 70 enabled the 1995 World Championship runner-up and 1996 British Open winner Nigel Bond to edge out Liang Wenbo (who achieved breaks of 86, 56, 48 and 45) 5–3 and avenge his opponent's 5–0 whitewash of him from the 2006 tournament. The two-time Welsh Open runner-up Alan McManus compiled a breaks of 113 and runs of 71 and 54 to defeat Rod Lawler 5–2, bemoaning afterwards of the lack of an audience in the arena because he felt more comfortable playing in front of a larger crowd.\nMarco Fu lost his match 2–5 to Higginson after the latter tied 2–2 and compiled a break of 125 along with runs of 70, 67 and 81. Stuart Bingham made a match-winning break of 115 to whitewash Joe Delaney 5–0. Michael Holt achieved breaks of 131, 104 and 115 in defeating Ricky Walden 5–4, as the former World Amateur Champion Ian Preece was whitewashed 5–0 by Mark Selby. Another whitewash occurred when Ryan Day was defeated 5–0 by Michael Judge, a match in which Day's highest break was 24 and Judge compiled a 137 total clearance to win the game. World number 54 Jamie Burnett made a match-high break of 43 en route to winning 5–3 against Robert Milkins. Breaks of 110 and 79 gave Jamie Cope a 5–1 victory over the struggling Ding Junhui. Provisional world number 36 Ian McCulloch trailed Allen 4–2 but breaks of 72, 47 and 74 gave him a 5–4 victory, although he said after the match that he was disappointed with his performance.\nRound 2.\nThe winners of round one went through to face members of the top 16 in the second round between 13 and 14 February. In this round Selby took just over an hour to defeat Matthew Stevens 5–1 with a 98% potting success rate and breaks of 65, 64, 133, 80 and 68. Afterwards, Stevens said he was angry with the WPBSA because he had been refused dispensation to remove his bow tie as he was ill with flu, which affected his vision and balance. Lee leveled 2–2 with Bond but the latter won three successive frames with a break of 68 to claim a 5–2 victory. Stephen Maguire achieved breaks of 121, 83 and 111 en route to whitewashing his compatriot McManus 5–0 in a match that ran for just over 90 minutes. John Higgins, the 2000 Welsh Open champion, was defeated 5–3 by the unranked Higginson. Trailing 3–0 Higginson took advantage of an error from Higgins to achieve successive breaks of 68, 50, 60 and 121 and won the match in the eighth frame following a fluked green ball and putting Higgins in a snookered position behind the brown ball.\nThe 2006 Malta Cup champion Ken Doherty took a 5–3 win over Swail from breaks of 49, 79, 116, 47 and 84 with Swail producing two breaks of 87 and a 65 to prevent his opponent from claiming an easy victory. Neil Robertson claimed a 5–2 victory against Holt. O'Sullivan began at 1–1 against McCulloch until he made a clearance in the third frame after McCulloch missed a ball while 49–43 ahead. Breaks of 109 and 53 and a 64 clearance on the black ball gave O'Sullivan a 5–3 win, after which he said his playing technique needed improving. World number 7 Peter Ebdon lost 4–5 to Harold, who came from 4–1 down to take the match to a final frame decider that lasted 38 minutes and ended when Ebdon hit a difficult pink ball instead of the brown ball and conceded. Anthony Hamilton ended a ten match and ten-month losing streak with a 5–4 victory over Perry. Coming from 3–1 behind at the mid-session interval Hamilton rallied to tie the match at 3–3 until Perry won the eighth frame on the pink ball. Hamilton won the final frame decider with a break of 119.\nStephen Hendry, a three-time Welsh Open champion, missed a frame winning opportunity at 4–0, allowing his opponent Woollaston to produce a 51 clearance in frame five and a break of 61 in the sixth. But Hendry recovered with a break of 127 in frame seven to win 5–2. Murphy took 72 minutes to whitewash Cope 5–0 and outscored him 556–32 in a game which saw Murphy become the first player in the history of snooker to produce four consecutive century breaks (a 135 clearance and runs of 123, 102 and 101) in a best-of-nine frames match and the second time it had been achieved in a major ranking tournament. Dott compiled a match-winning break of 114 for a 5–3 victory against Greene and the six-time world champion Steve Davis whitewashed Gilbert 5–0. Judge won 5–2 over number 12 seed Barry Hawkins with a game-winning break of 79 to extend Hawkins' record of not winning while in the top 16 rankings and the two-time world champion Mark Williams lost 4–5 to Burnett despite recovering from 4–2 down. The final second round match saw Ali Carter defeat Bingham 5–3.\nRound 3.\nIn the third round held on 15 February, O'Sullivan won 5–1 against Selby. He took the first frame by potting the pink ball, made a break of 70 in the second and won the third before Selby compiled a 100 break for a 3–1 score at the mid-session interval. A break of 80 in frame five and a sixth frame win earned O'Sullivan the victory. Hamilton overcame Harold 5–3 with a break of 120 to win his second game of the season in a match that lasted almost 3 hours and 20 minutes. Davis reached the 84th quarter-final of his career in a world ranking competition by defeating Dott 5–3. He built a 3–1 advantage with breaks of 82, 69 and 76 that Dott reduced by taking two successive frames. Dott missed a yellow ball shot to a baulk pocket in frame eight and Davis won the match with a clearance to the pink ball. Murphy prevailed 5–4 in a 3-hour and 48-minute match against Burnett. After trailing 2–0 and 4–2, Burnett recovered to force a final frame decider with a break of 104 in frame seven and he claimed the eighth on the blue ball after Murphy missed an easy brown ball shot. Murphy won frame nine unchallenged.\nIn his match against Hendry, Robertson took a 4–0 lead, a period in which Hendry did not pot a single ball in 39 minutes and Robertson achieved a 141 total clearance. Hendry responded to win three successive frames as he accumulated 255 points without reply from breaks of 64, 96 and 83. However, Robertson won the match 5–3 in frame eight with a run of 51. Robertson said after the match, \"This is first time since then I've had that really hungry attitude back\", and Hendry praised his opponent for his performance during the eighth frame. Doherty made breaks of 99 and 111 to tie 3–3 with Maguire but the latter drew clear to claim a 5–3 victory, his first win against Doherty in three attempts. Higginson reached the first quarter-final of his career with a 5–1 win over Judge, while Carter recovered from 3–0 down to narrowly defeat Bond 5–4.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals held on 16 February, Higginson achieved a maximum break in the second frame of his 5–1 victory over Ali Carter. It was the first maximum break of his career, the third in the history of the Welsh Open and the 56th in professional competition. Frames three and four were won by Higginson with breaks of 83 and 48 and accrued 342 points without reply. Carter prevented a whitewash with a break of 54 in frame five but Higginson won the match with a break of 104.\nRobertson won 5–4 against O'Sullivan in a closely contested match. Robertson went 2–0 up with breaks of 135 and 45, which O'Sullivan tied with breaks of 69 and 122 in the following two frames. O'Sullivan compiled a 109 break in frame five as he accumulated 322 unanswered points but Robertson had a reprieve when a button on O'Sullivan's waistcoat made contact with the yellow ball and won frame six. O'Sullivan won a fragmented seventh frame and Robertson took the match to a final frame decider with a century break of 124. Robertston won the match with a clearance and a 74–45 scoreline after O'Sullivan missed a straightforward red ball shot.\nDavis overcame Hamilton by the same scoreline to enter the 58th semi-final of a ranking tournament in his career. Coming from 3–0 and 4–3 behind Davis achieved a break of 61 after Hamilton (leading 46–0) grazed the black ball while attempting to pot a red ball in frame eight. Davis took advantage of three errors from Hamilton to complete the match and claim victory with a clearance from the green to pink balls in the final frame decider. Maguire twice came from a frame behind in his match against Murphy before gaining the lead in the fifth frame. He was able to maintain his advantage to win 5–3 and complete the semi-final lineup.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-final matches held on 17 February were increased to the best-of-11 frames. Robertson won 6–3 against Davis and was the first player to enter the final. Davis won the opening frame, with Robertson responding with a runs of 42 and 41 in the second after Davis missed a red ball shot. Robertson drew clear to lead 4–1 with breaks of 70, 109 and 79. Frame six was taken by Davis who came from 51–0 behind to compile a 54 clearance but lost a disjointed seventh frame to Robertson . Davis won frame eight with a break of 91 but Robertson completed the match in the ninth frame. After the match, Robertson spoke of his run into the final that saw him defeat three world champions, \"They've won lots of times at the Crucible and countless other tournaments as well so you could say it's been a big week for me, scalping wise. But it'll all count for nothing if I don't keep my focus in the final.\" Davis bemoaned missing a straightforward red ball in the second frame, \"When you do that Neil scores a lot of points. If your safety doesn't work against him there's damage done.\"\nThe other semi-final game saw Higginson become the first unranked player to enter the final of a ranking tournament since Terry Griffiths in the 1979 World Snooker Championship with his defeat over Maguire by the same scoreline. Both players shared the opening four frames of the match to level the score at 2–2. Higginson opened a two-frame lead with breaks of 66 and 94 in frames six and seven and a further break of 64 in the eighth after Maguire overran his intended position on the black ball while on a run of 48. Maguire delayed Higginson's win in frame eight but the latter compiled runs of 53 and 57 to take the victory in the ninth frame. Afterwards, Higginson called it \"a dream, totally surreal\" and said he would benefit from the ranking points, prize money and the additional experience, \"This is unbelievable. Before the start I was very nervous because I suddenly realised that I'd got a great chance to do something that was beyond my wildest dreams.\"\nFinal.\nThe best-of-17 frames final on 18 February was played against Robertson and Higginson. It was refereed by Michaela Tabb, who became the first woman in history to take charge of a ranking snooker event final. The pre-final favourite to win the tournament was Robertson, while his opponent Higginson was a 500–1 outsider in his third appearance in the main stages of a professional competition.\nRobertson won the first five of the six frames with breaks of 98, 76 and 71 as Higginson compiled a break of 114 in the second frame. Although Higginson clinched the seventh frame, Robertson produced a break of 74 in the eighth to conclude the first session 6–2 up. In the second session the first six frames were won by Higginson from breaks of 54, 100, 97, 64 and 81 en route to a 8–6 lead and outscored Robertson 425–49. This left Higginson within a solitary frame of winning the first ranking tournament of his career. However, Robertson compiled a clearance of 92, and breaks of 32 and 59 in frame fifteen to force the match to a final frame decider. Robertson maintained his composure to win the tournament and the match after Higginson missed a plant at the start of the last frame.\nAfter the match, Robertson praised Higginson's performance and said he had to remain patient and believe in himself despite feeling anxious, \"It was just a matter of getting a chance and thankfully I got it.\" Higginson said he was not disappointed to lose the tournament and revealed he entered the tournament without any anticipation since he was the underdog in most of his matches, \"I needed to win one more match to take the title and if someone had told me this would happen a week ago, I would have sent them for a drugs test. Getting this far is a dream come true.\"\nIt was Robertson's second ranking tournament win of the season after the Grand Prix in October 2006. He joined Cliff Thorburn, James Wattana and Ding Junhui as the fourth non-British or Irish player in history to win more than one career ranking competition. The victory earned Robertson £35,000; he moved to seventh in the provisional world rankings while Higginson rose to 40th. The event, according to Phil Yates of \"The Times\", would be remembered for Higginson's performance and praised him for \"greatly enhancing the tournament by so nearly defying ante-post odds of 500–1.\"\nMain draw.\nNumbers to the left of the players' names are the tournament seedings.

The team was captained by Andrew Stoddart and, except in the Test matches when it was called England, it was generally known as A. E. Stoddart's XI. The playing strength of the team was weakened by Stoddart acceding to a request from the Australians to bring “new blood”. As a result, established players including JT Brown, Albert Ward and Bobby Peel were not selected.\nStoddart only played in the third and fourth Test matches, following the news before the first Test that his mother had died. Archie MacLaren captained England in the first, second and fifth Tests. England won the first Test comfortably by nine wickets after Ranjisinhji played one of the great Test innings. Weakened by illness he batted at number 7 he scored 175 in 223 minutes, hitting 26 fours, a performance which set up the victory. Australia then emphatically won the next four Tests.\nAustralia, captained by Harry Trott, therefore regained The Ashes. Australia were well served in batting by Joe Darling (he scored 537 runs, including three centuries), Clem Hill and Charlie McLeod; and in bowling by Ernie Jones, Monty Noble and Hugh Trumble. J. T. Hearne and Tom Richardson were England's most successful bowlers but the team was largely let down by its batting, with only MacLaren and Ranjitsinhji earning any distinction.\nThe English team played a total of 23 matches on tour: five Tests; seven first-class matches against state teams; and eleven minor matches against local teams. In the state matches, Stoddart's XI won three, drew three and lost one.\nPlayers.\nThe English party consisted of thirteen players, twelve of whom played for England in the Test series:\nThe following players represented Australia in the Test series:\nTest series summary.\nAustralia won the Test series 4–1."

        "text": "Haywood v. National Basketball Association, 401 U.S. 1204 (1971), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled against the NBA's requirement that a player could not be drafted by an NBA team until four years after graduating from high school. Justice Douglas, in an in-chambers opinion, allowed Spencer Haywood to play in the NBA temporarily until the litigation could proceed further. The case was settled out of court, Haywood continued playing, and the NBA modified its four-year rule to allow players to enter the league early in cases of \"hardship\".\nBackground.\nSpencer Haywood turned pro after his sophomore season at the University of Detroit, joining the American Basketball Association’s (ABA) Denver Rockets in 1969. While both the NBA and the ABA required players to be at least four years removed from their high school graduation, the ABA offered a hardship exemption. With his mother raising 10 children while picking cotton at $2 per day (equivalent to about $ per day in ), Haywood met the criteria.\nHaywood led the ABA in scoring (30.0 per game) and rebounding (19.5 per game) in 1969-70, before jumping to the NBA the following season. Seattle SuperSonics owner Sam Schulman signed Haywood to a six-year, $1.5 million contract, ignoring the four-year rule. As a result, the NBA threatened to disallow the contract and implement various sanctions against the SuperSonics.\nProcedural history.\nHaywood challenged this decision by commencing an antitrust action against the NBA. As part of his claim against the NBA, Haywood argued that the conduct of the NBA was a \"group boycott\" and a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The central issue that had to be determined was whether the NBA draft policy was a restraint on trade and therefore was illegal in accordance with the Sherman Act.\nThe case was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which issued an injunction in Haywood's favor, ruling:\nThe NBA appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which stayed the injunction. Joined by the SuperSonics, Haywood appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the District Court, reinstated that court's injunction against the NBA, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings.\nImpact.\nShortly after the Supreme Court's decision, the league and Haywood reached an out-of-court settlement which allowed him to stay with the Sonics permanently.\nThe decision allowed a significant number of high school graduates and college attendees to make themselves eligible for the NBA draft without waiting until four years after high school."

        "text": "Baseball in the Tampa Bay area, both amateur and professional, has had a long and storied history, even though the Tampa Bay Rays are one of the two youngest franchises in Major League Baseball, the other being the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nSpring training.\nIn 1913, the Chicago Cubs moved their spring training site to the city of Tampa. St. Petersburg soon followed, becoming a spring training host for the first time in 1914 when the St. Louis Browns came to town.\nSt. Petersburg.\nSince 1914, more Major League spring training games have been played in St. Petersburg than any other city.\nTampa.\nTampa has hosted spring training for seven teams: the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, Washington Senators, and the New York Yankees, who currently call Tampa their spring training home.\nDunedin.\nDunedin has been the only spring training home to the Toronto Blue Jays since the franchise's inception.\nMinor leagues.\nPast.\nThe Tampa Bay area has had a long association with minor league baseball. The first modern example was the 1919 Tampa Smokers, a charter member of the original Class D Florida State League (FSL). The expansion St. Petersburg Saints joined the FSL in 1920. After the Smokers folded in 1954, the Tampa Tarpons played in the FSL from 1957 until 1989.\nTampa, St. Petersburg, and other nearby communities also fielded teams in a variety of defunct minor leagues, including the Florida International League, the Florida State Negro League, and the short-lived Florida West Coast League.\nPresent.\nThe Tampa Bay area is currently home to five teams in Low-A Southeast, a Low-A circuit which effectively replaced the Class-A Advanced Florida State League following the 2021 reorganization of Minor League Baseball: the Tampa Tarpons, Clearwater Threshers, Dunedin Blue Jays, Bradenton Marauders, and Lakeland Flying Tigers. Several major league organizations also field squads in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League and the Florida Instructional League.\nBesides hosting actual baseball games, the corporate offices of Minor League Baseball have been located in St. Petersburg since 1973.\nOther professional leagues.\nSt. Petersburg was the home of the St. Petersburg Pelicans in the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989–1990. The league featured former major league players who were age 35 or older. The Pelicans won the only league championship.\nCollege baseball.\nSeveral notable ballplayers have come from the college and university baseball programs in the Tampa Bay Area. Players and managers have reached the Major Leagues from the University of South Florida, University of Tampa, St. Petersburg College and Eckerd College. Other schools in the area with baseball programs include Pasco-Hernando Community College, Saint Leo University, and Hillsborough Community College.\nThe University of Tampa Spartans baseball program has won eight Division II national championships: 1992, 1993, 1998, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2019.\nAmateur baseball.\nAmateur baseball also has a long tradition in the Tampa Bay area. This tradition began in the ballfields of Ybor City and West Tampa, two neighborhoods founded in the late 1800s by immigrants from Cuba, Spain, and Italy. The neighborhoods were home to many social clubs, many of which sponsored highly competitive teams that inspired much local support.\nToday, high school and AAU baseball in the area is very competitive, with many players drafted out of high school into the major leagues every year.\nLittle League Baseball teams from the area have excelled in the Little League World Series, finishing as Runners-Up in the 1948, 1975, 1980 &amp; 1981 Little League World Series tournaments. Tampa Bay area teams have won the state Little League tournament in 1967, 1969–1975, 1977, 1980–1981, 1988–1991, 1994, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2012. In addition, local teams have won Junior League championships in 1982, 1985, 2004, and 2011.\nLittle League Baseball's headquarters for the Southern Region was located in Gulfport until 2009.\nNotable baseball players from the Tampa Bay area.\nAl López, the first area native to play and manage in the major leagues and the first to be enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame, came out of the leagues of Ybor City in the early 20th century. Since then, many current and former major league players and managers such as Lou Piniella, Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Tino Martinez, Luis Gonzalez, Dwight Gooden, Howard Johnson, Brad Radke, Craig Lefferts, Tony La Russa, Matt Joyce, Chone Figgins, Ryan Raburn, Hall of Famer Wade Boggs and Steve Garvey (among many others) have gotten their start on local baseball programs around the area.\nTampa Baseball Museum.\nThe Tampa Baseball Museum is being developed by the Ybor City Museum Society and will cover more than 130 years of Tampa's baseball history. It will be a place to celebrate the Tampa Bay area's rich baseball history with memorabilia and exhibits. The museum building was once the childhood home of Al López, Tampa's first Major League player, manager, and Hall of Fame inductee. The house was moved to its present location across the street from the Ybor City State Museum and has been completely rehabilitated. The Tampa Baseball Museum will open once exhibits are completed and installed."

        "text": "The 1994 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament featured 64 teams for the first time ever. The Final Four consisted of North Carolina, Purdue, Louisiana Tech, and Alabama, with North Carolina defeating Louisiana Tech 60–59 to win its first NCAA title on a 3-point shot by Charlotte Smith as time expired. The ball was inbounded with only 00:00.7 left on the clock, making it one of the most exciting finishes in tournament history.\nNotable events.\nThe Alabama team was a six seed in the Midwest region. After beating the 11 seed Oregon State, they faced a higher seed, Iowa, who were seeded third in the region. Alabama won that game, and went on to face another higher seed in Texas Tech, the defending national champions. Alabama won again, and went on to face Penn State, the top seed in the region. Alabama won yet again, this time by 14 points, to advance to their first final Four.\nIn the semi-final game of the Final Four, they faced Louisiana Tech, a team they had played earlier in the year. In their December match-up, Alabama had beaten the Lady Techsters by 22 points, 99–77. In this game La tech opened up a six-point lead at the half. Alabama's All-American guard Niesa Johnson cut her hand on a locker room sink, which required seven stitches. Because it was such an important game, Johnson was bandaged and medicated and returned to the game. The Alabama team fought back from an eleven-point deficit and cut the margin to two points with seconds to play. The plan was to get the ball to Betsy Harris to attempt a three-point play, but Harris stepped out of bounds. After a made free throw, they had one more chance with a three-point attempt but it failed, and La Tech moved on to the championship game.\nIn the other semifinal game, the North Carolina team faced Purdue. North Carolina's Charlotte Smith was expected to be an important key to the game, and the Purdue coach, Lin Dunn, tried to prepare the team to handle Smith. That planning was ineffective, as Smith scored 23 points, and set a personal career records for assists with eight. The Purdue team was down 13 points in the first half, but fought back and managed to take a two-point lead in the second half. However, the Tar Heels switched to a zone defense after made baskets, and retook the lead, ending up with an 89–74 victory, and the first North Carolina team to make it to the Championship game.\nIn addition to Charlotte Smith, North Carolina had a freshman guard Marion Jones who would later be known for world class performances in track and field. Jones picked up her third foul only six minutes in the game and had to sit. This \"rattled\" the North Carolina team but they kept the game close. When the game drew to a close, the La Tech team had a two-point advantage with less than a second on the clock, but North Carolina had the ball. With 0.7 seconds left, there was just enough time to catch and shoot. The ball was inbounded to Charlotte Smith who had made only eight three-pointers on 31 attempts during the season. Smith launched the ball, but never saw what happened as her vision was blocked. Her teammates mobbed her, and she realized she had hit the shot to complete one of the most dramatic finishes in NCAA Championship history. North Carolina won the Championship 60–59.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 1994 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-two conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1994 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-two additional teams were selected to complete the sixty-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-two conferences earned an automatic bid. In sixteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-two additional at-large teams were selected from sixteen of the conferences.\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty-six states, plus Washington, D.C. Texas had the most teams with five bids. Fourteen states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nFirst- and second-round games played at higher seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nEighteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nFourteen conferences went 0-1: Big South Conference, Ivy League, MAAC, MAC, MEAC, Midwestern Collegiate, North Atlantic Conference, Northeast Conference, Ohio Valley Conference, Patriot League, Southern Conference, Southland, SWAC, and Trans America."

        "text": "Daniel Richard Cole (born 9 May 1987) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a prop for Premiership Rugby club Leicester Tigers and the England national team.\nCole has been part of multiple Six Nations Championship campaigns and contributed to England’s successes, including victories in 2017 and 2020 and the Grand Slam in 2016. Predominantly playing as a tighthead prop, he has also earned caps for England in over 100 test matches and notably represented the British &amp; Irish Lions on two separate tours to Australia and New Zealand.\nClub career.\nCole's first team début came in the October 2007 EDF Energy Cup pool match against Bath. Most of the 2007–08 season was spent on loan to Bedford Blues and it was the beginning of the 2008–09 season before Cole played for the first team again. Cole was involved in most of the games in the first half of the season. In January 2009, Cole was loaned to Nottingham R.F.C. and subsequently returned to Leicester later in the season to feature as a replacement as Tigers beat London Irish by a single point in the final of the 2008–09 Premiership.\nThrough injury to Leicester tight-heads Julian White and Martin Castrogiovanni, Cole achieved a run of games during the 2009–10 season which saw him gain notoriety as man-of-the-match against Wasps. In February 2010, Cole signed a new contract. The Tigers went on to retain their league title winning the 2009–10 Premiership final 33–27 against Saracens, where Cole again came on as a replacement for Castrogiovanni. In 2013 Cole won his third Premiership title on this occasion starting in the victory over local rivals Northampton Saints.\nCole won the Outstanding Service Award at the end of the 2016/17 season.\nCole started the 2022 Premiership Rugby final as Tigers beat Saracens 15-12, with Cole winning his fourth title. On 17 December 2022 Cole made his 300th appearance for Leicester, only the 36th player to achieve the feat, in a 23-16 win against Clermont Auvergne.\nInternational career.\nEngland.\nCole was a member of the squad that finished third at the 2006 Under 19 Rugby World Championship and the following year represented the England under-20 team in the Six Nations Under 20s Championship. In January 2009 he made his debut for the England Saxons against and later that year started all three games at the 2009 Churchill Cup, including the final against Ireland A.\nCole was promoted to the Senior Squad for the 2010 Six Nations Championship as injury cover for Tigers squadmate Julian White and made his senior England debut as a replacement for David Wilson in England's 30–17 win over in the opening round of the tournament on 6 February 2010. He played in all subsequent games in the 2010 Six Nations, earning his first start against Italy and scoring his first international try in what was also his first home start against , and began to cement his place as England's first-choice tighthead.\nCole was taken on the 2010 summer tour of Australia and played in both matches. Although England lost the first game, Cole put in a strong performance which saw the England scrum gain an unprecedented two penalty tries. The second Test saw England beat Australia 20–21. He was a member of the side that won the 2011 Six Nations Championship missing out on a grand slam with defeat in the final round against Ireland. He was included in the squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and started in their quarter-final elimination against France.\nCole won his fiftieth cap in the final round of the 2015 Six Nations Championship against France as England finished runners up in the tournament. He was included in Stuart Lancaster's 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup and went on to start in all four of their pool games as the hosts failed to reach the knock out phase.\nCole was included in new coach Eddie Jones's 31-man squad for the 2016 Six Nations and scored a try in the final game against France as England completed the grand slam. Cole was included in the 2016 tour of Australia; he played in the one-off test against Wales at Twickenham, which also saw a debut for Leicester teammate Ellis Genge, and started in all three tests in Australia. Cole scored a try in the final test of the series in which England whitewashed the Wallabies for the first time. The following year saw Cole score a try against Italy during the 2017 Six Nations Championship as the team eventually retained their title missing out on a consecutive grand slam with defeat in the final game away to Ireland which also brought an end to a record equalling eighteen successive Test victories.\nAlthough Cole was dropped from England's international team at the end of 2018, a resurgence in form saw him re-selected for the 2019 Six Nations Championship. Cole's continued good form saw him chosen for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, for what would be his third Rugby World Cup. On 26 September 2019, in a World Cup pool match against the United States, Cole became England's joint-third highest capped player with 91 international appearances. In the World Cup final starter Kyle Sinckler was knocked unconscious after two minutes and replaced by Cole for the remainder of the game as England were defeated by South Africa to finish runners up.\nOn 7 August 2023, Cole was named in England's squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nCole was one of 37 players selected to represent the Lions on their 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia and featured in all three Tests as the Lions won their first series for sixteen years.\nIn 2017 Cole was selected for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, he did not make the test team but featured in five non-capped tour games. Overall he played fourteen times for the Lions on the 2013 and 2017 tours winning three caps."

The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nThe Football Federation of Chile is the second oldest South American federation, with 127 years of existence. Its foundation dates back to June 19, 1895, at the port city of Valparaiso. Its first President was David Scott.

The championships were used as the Australian trials for the 2008 Olympic Games squad.\nLike all previous Australian swimming trials, the championships program mirrored the 2008 Olympic swimming program with the addition of the non-Olympic events – 50 m backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly; 800 m freestyle (men) and 1500 m freestyle (women).\nResults.\nHighlighted swimmers achieved the qualification conditions to be included in the Olympic team in that respective event.\nOlympic team news.\nDue to strong performances, two additional members were added to the Australian Olympic swim team: Nick Ffrost and Felicity Galvez both finished seventh in their 200 m freestyle events. Additionally, Galvez finished third in the women's 200 m butterfly. It is assumed Galvez will swim the heat of the 4×100 m medley relay with Libby Trickett likely to swim the freestyle leg, elevating Jessicah Schipper into the butterfly position. This however has created controversy with freestyler Andrew Mewing appealing his non-selection after finishing 8th with an A qualifying time, whilst Galvez was selected via a B qualifying time, that ranked her 9th in the 200 m freestyle. Mewing lost his appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Adam Lucas finished second in both the 200 m and 400 m individual medley events, but was not selected because he swam a B qualifying time, rather than an A qualifying time. These are the only events on the Australian roster that remain without a second qualifier.\nMelissa Gorman failed to meet the qualification time for the 800 m freestyle at the championships themselves, however was included in the team to swim this event after qualifying for the 10 km marathon swimming event.\nDuring the early hours of 30 March 2008, Nick D'Arcy was involved in an altercation with a fellow Australia swimmer, Simon Cowley. Cowley was a winner of three gold medals at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. D'Arcy is now facing possible expulsion from the 2008 Olympic team. In his own decision, D'Arcy withdrew from the upcoming 2008 World Short Course Championships. He has been charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm."

        "title": "International Cycling Association",
        "text": "The International Cycling Association (ICA) was the first international body for cycle racing. Founded by Henry Sturmey in 1892 to establish a common definition of amateurism and to organise world championships its role was taken over by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1900.\nBackground.\nThe ethos at the end of the 19th century and the increasing influence of the Olympic Games made amateurism an issue in many sports. It was especially relevant in cycle racing because riders had begun travelling internationally to compete in track, or velodrome, races. Riders from one country would complain that they were at a disadvantage to those from another, that they were riding against what they considered to be professionals.\nThe world's dominant cycling association was the National Cyclists' Union (NCU) in Britain. The historian Jim McGurn said:\nThe NCU's championships were considered the unofficial championships of the world. It was because the sport needed world championships independent of any national body that Henry Sturmey of the magazine \"The Cyclist\" and later founder of the Sturmey-Archer gear company proposed an International Cyclists Association in 1892. Having secured the co-operation of British officials and writers such as George Lacy Hillier, he approached other countries' national associations through the NCU.\nThey met in the Royal Agricultural Hall, London in November 1892, listed as representing the NCU (Henry Sturmey and W. M. Appleton), the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (A. E. Kemplen), German Cyclists Union (Heinrich Kleyer), Dutch Cyclists Union (Franz Netcher), Italian Cyclists Union (G. Bonetti), Belgian Cyclists Union (A. Choisy), Canadian Cyclists Association (Dr P. E. Doolittle).\nTrouble was already in store because the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques was not the French national body. The national body, the Union Vélocipèdique Française, sent observers but was not allowed to take part because the NCU had broken off relationships with it over the question of amateurism. \"Scottish Cyclist\" reported:\nThe meeting agreed that any country could belong to the ICA \"providing they enforce a strict amateur rule\", resolved to hold a world championship on the track at one mile, 10 km and, with pacers, 100 km. \"If possible,\" the meeting resolved, \"a team race of teams of not more than four, at a distance of 10km.\"\nThe Zimmerman problem.\nThe case for a common definition of amateurism was accentuated by the case of the American, Arthur Augustus Zimmerman. Zimmerman was an amateur. By the definition proposed by the ICA, that meant:\nZimmerman was \"recognised as an amateur by the ruling body of his country\", the League of American Wheelmen. The \"New York Times\" listed his winnings in 1892 as including 29 bicycles, several horses and carriages, half a dozen pianos, a house, land, furniture and \"enough silver plates, medals and jewellery to stock a jewellery store.\" That summer he took the British mile, five-mile, 25-mile and 50-mile championships, all on the track. Next year he came back with two Raleigh bikes, his name in Raleigh advertising, and - the NCU suspected - Raleigh money in his wallet as well.\nThe NCU banned Zimmerman from Britain. But a further weakness in the ICA appeared when the League of American Wheelmen and the associations of other countries took no notice: there was no insistence in the rules that all member countries had to recognise the decisions of others.\nThe world championships.\nThe first world championships were held in Chicago, the winners receiving a gold medal and all participants a silver medal. The distance from the centre of world cycling in Europe limited the number of riders and Americans won two of the three gold medals. The tables below show what would have happened had gold, bronze and silver medals been awarded to the first three.\nThe following championships were run in Antwerp, Cologne, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Vienna and Montreal.\nThe end of the ICA.\n\"After a modest start in the early 1890s,\" said the British cycling official George Herbert Stancer, \"[the ICA] achieved considerable success, eventually gaining the support of all the important sport-controlling bodies in the cycling world. But he went on:\nFrance's objection was that Britain had more than one vote and more than one team in championships. The NCU represented only England and the associations of the other individual nations that made up the United Kingdom were separately represented.\nThe sequence of world championships meant that France was due to promote them, in Paris, in 1900. France no longer wanted to tolerate the system in which several British teams competed and a proposal at an ICA meeting before the 1900 championships called for the UK to be limited to one. Stancer said no warning had been given and that representatives of Scotland, Ireland and three colonies included in the motion were not present. Sturmey succeeded in having the proposal postponed rather than have the countries \"kicked out in their absence,\" as Stancer put it.\nBefore the fresh meeting was held, Stancer said, France convened a meeting in Paris and formed the Union Cycliste Internationale. Not only would it permit just one team from the United Kingdom but the NCU and Britain's other governing bodies were excluded because they had not been at the founding meeting. It took until 1903 for Britain to be admitted."

        "title": "Clout archery",
        "text": "Clout archery is a form of archery in which archers shoot arrows at a flag (known as \"the Clout\") from a relatively long distance and score points depending on how close each arrow lands to the flag.\nScoring zones are defined by maximum radii from the flag pole. Each arrow scores points depending on which scoring zone it enters the ground in. An arrow embedded in the flag pole is counted as being in the highest scoring zone. If an arrow is lying on the ground, it is considered to be in the scoring zone in which its point lies.\nThe scoring zones may be marked on the ground. Where this is not practical, a non-stretch rope or chain marked with the radii of the scoring zones is attached to the flag pole and swept around it to determine which arrows are in which zones.\nA designated person collects the arrows in each zone, sorts them into sets, and lays them on the ground. Each archer in turn points to his or her arrows and calls out the scores in descending order.\nA single clout round consists of three dozen arrows, shot in ends of 6 arrows. Tournaments typically consist of a double clout round, in which a total of six dozen arrows is shot.\nArchery GB clout.\nThe Archery GB version of clout is used in the United Kingdom. The information in this section is drawn from Part 7 Clout Shooting of the Rules of Shooting (January 2023).\nFlags are set at specified distances for combinations of age and gender. The archer's bow type does not affect the distance the archer shoots.\nEach flag consists of a square piece of coloured fabric on a short softwood pole, the flag to be as close to the ground as is practical.\nShooting may be \"one way\" or \"two way\":\nA minimum overshoot is required behind each set of flags.\nMost Archery GB clout shoots are one-way.\nEach arrow scores points depending on which scoring zone it lands in. Scoring zones are defined by maximum radii from the flag pole.\nBLBS clout.\nThe British Long-Bow Society has its own form of clout shooting. The Society restricts the archers to the use of English longbows and wooden arrows.\nLadies shoot , gentlemen . BLBS clouts are always two-way.\nThe target is a diameter, white, resting on a frame at 45 degrees to the ground with a central black spot. Concentric rings are marked at , , , and from the centre.\nScoring is 6 for a clout, down to 1 for the outside ring. 2 rounds of 36 arrows in 12 ends of 3 are shot to make a 'Double Clout Round'\nAt the Woodmen of Arden's traditional shoots, the 'marker' at the target end steps from behind his screen, lies on his back and waves his top hat in the air to signify that a clout has been scored.\nWA clout.\nThe WA version of clout is used worldwide. The information in this section is drawn from Book 5 Miscellaneous of the WA Constitution and Rules. (WA 2008)\nFlags are set at specified distances for combinations of gender and bow type.\nThe WA rules do not define any separate distances for juniors or for longbows, though tournament organisers will often introduce such additional distances.\nEach flag consists of a piece of coloured fabric not exceeding high and wide on a softwood pole, the flag to be no more than from the ground.\nShooting may only be \"one way\".\nAustralian clout.\nThe Archery Australia version of clout is used in Australia. The information in this section is drawn from Section 12 Clout Archery of the Archery Australia Constitution and Rules. (AUST – online version)\nSeveral possible shooting distances are defined. The archer selects the distance he or she wants to shoot, though for record purposes only certain combinations of age class, gender, bow division and distance are recognised.\nThe same clout target may be used for archers shooting at different distances. A shooting line is set up for each distance and the shooting is staggered so that each distance is shot with safety in mind. All archers shoot at the same time.\nEach clout consists of a point-down triangular structure (usually made from laminated cardboard, so as to prevent arrows passing through) not exceeding high and wide at its widest point on a suitable (e.g. softwood) pole, the clout to be from the ground.\nSmall flags are placed on each side of the clout at intervals, so that the archers can see where the outer edges of the even-numbered scoring zones are. The flags are colored as (from the centre), gold, red, blue, black and white (i.e. the colours of an archery target).\nShooting is only in one direction (generally to the south).\nEach arrow scores points depending on which scoring zone it lands in. Scoring zones are defined by maximum radii from the flag pole. There are ten zones in Australian clout. Zones may be marked on the ground, but these are not used for scoring. Only the scoring zones marked on the rope or chain are used for scoring."

        "title": "1959–60 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1959–60 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team is the only basketball team to win a national title in Ohio State history. They were coached by Hall of Fame coach Fred Taylor and had three future Hall of Famers on their roster—center Jerry Lucas, forward John Havlicek, and reserve forward Bob Knight, who entered the Hall for his storied coaching career, most notably at Indiana.\nSeason summary.\nCoach Fred Taylor started two sophomores at the beginning of the season, Lucas and Mel Nowell, with returnees Joe Roberts, Larry Siegfried and Dick Furry. An injury to Furry got Havlicek inserted into that first game, and he started thereafter.\nIn this era, freshman could not play varsity college basketball. The recruiting class of Lucas, Nowell, Havlicek, Knight, and Gary Gearhart were not eligible to lead the Buckeyes until 1959–60. This was their first college season of play as the game is considered today.\nThe 1959–60 team posted the best shooting, highest-scoring team in college basketball that season at over 90 points per game. The key to the attack was the rebounding and outlet passing of Lucas. The other four athletes routinely overwhelmed opponents with fast break baskets. In 1960, this kind of offensive play was then the cutting edge of the game, and a big reason why all five starters were later drafted into the NBA. There were only eight NBA teams at this time, so this was not an easy feat.\nLucas shot a then-record 63% from the floor that season in an era when some college starters commonly shot 35% from the floor. More than just a great rebounder, he also had a great shooting eye from as far out as 25 feet (there was no three-point line then), and also had a hook shot that was nearly automatic. While the statistic was not well-kept then, Lucas probably led this team in assists, at 5–6 per game, he was an outstanding passer as well. He came very close to leading the country in both individual scoring and rebounding as well as shooting. After the outstanding Lucas, the Bucks may have had the best backcourt in the country in Siegfried and Nowell. Siegfried was then rated very highly as an all-around guard at both ends of the court. With Havlicek looked to contribute to the great offensive team with his hustling defense, Siegfried became active this season in this area as well and was outstanding. Nowell had one-on-one playground skills that were well-developed and effective immediately that season. With three sophomores now starting, Ohio State did have two early-season losses to Utah and Kentucky, but then clicked through the rest of the schedule. A late-season loss to Indiana came after they had clinched the Big Ten.\nThe Buckeyes steamrolled through the NCAA tournament by an average of 19.5 points a game, dusting off defending national champion California 75–55 in the final behind two future NBA stars, Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek, two excellent guards in Larry Siegfried and Mel Nowell and a defensive work ethic that limited opponents to .388 shooting over the course of the season. The team was also very well-coached. After Hall-of-Famer Taylor, Graf had coached at Harvard and was very strong on defense. Truitt later led as a college coach at several NCAA schools.\nNCAA Basketball Championship.\nIn that game, the Buckeyes shooting was off the charts, but it was also defense that won them the championship. Lucas gave Darrall Imhoff room only when he was far away from the basket; in close, he was always between Imhoff and the ball. Still, very few in the noisy capacity audience at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California -most of them California partisans- were ready to concede defeat to the Big Ten champions. Often enough in the past, California had come from behind to win on the wings of its mistake-inducing press. Pete Newell brought his team back into play in the second half, with a crushing defense and within five minutes, Cal scored 10 points to Ohio State's 5. Ironically, though, it was this fanatical defense that eventually proved to be Cal's undoing. Covering on the Ohio State man with the ball, the Golden Bears were obliged to uncover a free man somewhere else. After a short period of fumbling, Ohio State began to find him. Two or three furiously quick breaks with more than five minutes to go destroyed California for good. When the flurry was over, Ohio State's shooting percentage was a remarkable 67.4 percent, and its victory margin was the largest in the 22-year history of the NCAA finals."

The Negro League Committee also met in person and selected two players, Martín Dihigo and John Henry Lloyd. The Negro League Committee also decided to disband; it had elected nine players in seven years. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 8, 1977, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1957 or later, but not after 1971; the ballot included candidates from the 1976 ballot who were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1971. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.

        "text": "The National Bowling Stadium is a ten-pin bowling stadium in Reno, Nevada. The stadium is recognizable for an aluminum geodesic dome in its facade, built to resemble a large bowling ball.\nNicknamed the \"Taj Mahal of tenpins\", the 78-lane stadium opened on February 3, 1995, cost $47.5 million, and took three years to build. It is often the filming location for bowling scenes in films.\nConstruction and financing.\nThe stadium was constructed as part of a renovation effort of downtown Reno, which also saw the construction of the Silver Legacy Resort Casino, The concept for construction of the stadium was in part to capture tourism dollars being sent to Las Vegas, and as part of an agreement with the American Bowling Congress that upon construction of a first-class permanent facility, they would ensure their return to Reno every third year. The project was funded by a room tax lobbied by the city of Reno to the Nevada Legislature based on commitments from the American Bowling Congress and the Women's International Bowling Congress, which itself merged with the ABC to form the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) in 2005.\nThe original construction of the stadium had 80 lanes, but since an architectural error resulted in the stadium not having a center aisle for bowlers to march out for the team event, the center lanes had to be converted to an aisle. Despite the conversion to a 78-lane facility, the main pro shop/gift shop is still called \"Lane 81\".\nFeatures.\nThe stadium can be covered to be converted to convention space. It utilizes fully automatic scoring on what (upon construction) was the world's longest rigid, backlight video screen, with oversight from a computerized command center on the stadium's fifth level. When it opened in 1995, it was just in time to welcome 100,000 members of the American Bowling Congress for their 100th anniversary meeting. In 2009 the National Bowling Stadium broke the record for most United States Bowling Congress championships hosted, surpassing the tie between Buffalo and Toledo.\nThe stadium also hosts an extension of the International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame (IBM/HF), which is located in Arlington, Texas. The museum displays hall-of-fame portraits as well as artifacts collected and preserved by the IBM/HF.\nFilm history.\nThe National Bowling Stadium has been the filming location for several feature films. In addition to being the location of the grand finale between Bill Murray and Woody Harrelson's characters in the 1996 bowling film \"Kingpin\", the stadium was also a setting in the Michael J. Fox/Kirk Douglas film \"Greedy\"."

The Pirates selected him in the 31st round of the 1965 amateur draft. His debut for the Pirates on May 30, 1970 was memorable. He relieved Gene Garber in the fifth inning of a game at Forbes Field against the San Francisco Giants, struck out Willie Mays, and got Willie McCovey to hit into a double play; he finished that appearance with three perfect innings pitched and four strikeouts, and hit a single in his only plate appearance.\nNelson started his career with a 4-0 record for the Pirates in 1970, a feat not equaled by a Pirates starting pitcher until Zach Duke in 2005. Nelson also was the last Pirate pitcher to win his first 3 career starts until Gerrit Cole matched the feat in 2013.\nNelson also was the starting and winning pitcher in the final game played at Forbes Field on June 28, 1970. He commented on the fans' frenzy at the end of that game: \"After the game, the fans stormed the field and took everything, grass, bases, numbers off the scoreboard. I even saw some old ladies with parts of chairs. It was a real scene.\"\nNelson appeared in 15 games for the Pirates in 1970 and 17 games in 1971, both as a starter and a reliever. He struggled with control in 1971, walking 26 batters in 34 innings. In July, he was demoted to the minor leagues, but refused to report to his minor-league team. Although his teammates voted him a half-share of their 1971 World Series money, Pirates management did not award him a World Series ring. He underwent rotator cuff surgery and never returned to the majors.\nNelson was a good-hitting pitcher, with 7 hits in 26 career at bats for a batting average of .269.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Nelson became a produce salesman. He died unexpectedly at his Sacramento, California home at age 57 in 2004."

        "text": "This is a record of Argentina's results at the FIFA World Cup. Argentina is one of the most successful teams in the tournament's history, having won three World Cups: in 1978, 1986, and 2022. Argentina has also been runner-up three times: in 1930, 1990 and 2014. In 18 World Cup tournaments, Argentina has 47 victories in 88 matches. The team was present in all but four of the World Cups, being behind only Brazil and Germany in number of appearances.\nWorld Cup Finals.\n1930 v Uruguay.\nThe inaugural FIFA World Cup tournament culminated with Argentina facing hosts and current Olympic champions Uruguay. The match was turned twice: Argentina went into half-time with a 2–1 lead in spite of an early goal for Uruguay, but the hosts ultimately won 4–2. Guillermo Stábile, one of Argentina's scorers, became the tournament's top striker with 8 goals total.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\n1978 v the Netherlands.\nArgentina hosted the 1978 edition of the World Cup and reached the final. The Netherlands had already played the previous final in West Germany 1974 - and also lost to the hosts.\nDiego Maradona was 17 years old at this point and already a star in his home country, but did not make the squad as coach César Luis Menotti felt he was too inexperienced to handle the pressure of this major tournament. The playmaker position was instead filled by Mario Kempes, who ended up becoming the first Argentinian to win the Golden Ball in addition to being the tournament's top scorer with 6 goals.\nThe Dutch side was missing a superstar of their own: Johan Cruyff did not join the 1978 World Cup squads due to the aftermath of a kidnapping attempt which occurred in 1977. He only disclosed this information 30 years later.\nThe closely contested match was influenced by a hostile atmosphere and ended with the Dutch players refusing to attend the award ceremony after Argentina grabbed the title in extra time.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n1986 v West Germany.\nEight years after the victory on home soil, Argentina won the World Cup title for the second time. Diego Maradona was voted Best Player of the tournament after scoring five goals and assisting the decisive 3-2 by Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute of the final. The match was played in front of a record attendance of 114,600 people.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n1990 v West Germany.\nIn 1990, Argentina faced West Germany in a repeat of the 1986 edition. Pedro Monzón became the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup final, but was later joined by teammate Gustavo Dezotti. The match was decided by a penalty kick in favour of Germany.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n2014 v Germany.\nIn 2014, Argentina reached the final for the fifth time and for a third time had to face the German team, making it the most recurrent meeting for a final. In spite of a number of chances on both sides, regular time finished goalless. In the second half of extra time, substitute striker Mario Götze scored the decisive goal for Germany.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n2022 v France.\nArgentina opened up the scoring when Messi scored a penalty kick, and doubled their lead with a Di Maria goal in the 36th minute. France made two substitutions in the first half, but went into half-time trailing 0–2. Despite not having a shot until after the 80th minute, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area. Mbappé scored the penalty, and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores. With the scores tied, the match went to extra time. Messi scored again for Argentina in the second extra time half. Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after his initial shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in the final of a men's World Cup. With the scores tied at 3–3, the match was completed by a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\nRecord by opponent.\nArgentina have played a total of 88 FIFA World Cup games through 18 tournaments, facing 39 rivals.\nTeams in bold denote world cup winners, teams in \"italics\" show teams which played its first match ever in a World Cup against Argentina.&lt;br&gt;\nTeams with a * mark no longer exist. East Germany was annexed to Germany. Soviet Union now plays as Russia.&lt;br&gt;\n+Played as Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.\nHead coaches.\nThrough Argentinian team history, several coaches had trained it with different football styles from offensive to defensive tactics. There are two predominant 'football schools' about world champions coaches César Menotti who propagates possession and well-look play and Carlos Bilardo who prioritize results and tactical order. These head coaches divides Argentine fans kindly. Other managers such as Marcelo Bielsa has got his own football style. In another way this list shows records in World Cups and in qualifying stages excluding friendlies.\nFrom 1994 towards, three points are given for a win. Previously were two.\nAgainst conferences.\nFIFA delegates regional qualification and other organization affairs to continental conferences, so it divides into six differents of them grouped by geographical location. Argentina plays in CONMEBOL conference in South America. Due to World Cup rules that two teams of same confederation can not play in the same group in first round except for UEFA, it commonly faces teams which plays outside its continent most recently from Africa and Asia. Argentine national has never played versus an Oceanian (OFC) squad.\nAgainst debutants.\n'Albiceleste' has played against first-world-cup teams more than other, doing so 17 times, 7 of them being the first World Cup match ever. This list shows records versus those selections including all-debutants 1930 edition. Curiously, Argentina's debut was versus France which previously had played before.\nSweden, Bulgaria, Greece, Japan, Ivory Coast, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland played its first time against Argentina.&lt;br&gt;France, Mexico, Chile, United States, Uruguay, Northern Ireland, Haiti, East Germany, Jamaica and Croatia played in its first world cup but after first game.\nRecords and statistics.\nMost appearances.\nLionel Messi has captained the team in 19 matches.\nLionel Messi's total of 26 matches is a record for the side and the most for a player at the FIFA World Cup.\nMiscellaneous.\nArgentina's game versus West Germany in 1958 featured a yellow jersey instead of the traditional light blue and white colors or blue as alternate. This was because both teams wore white jerseys, creating confusion. As the South American side forgot to bring an alternate one, they decided to borrow jerseys from local team club Malmö. Germany won 3–1.\nIn the 1978 France - Hungary match something similar occurred. Both teams arrived to the match with white jerseys, so France was forced to borrow jerseys from Mar del Plata's local club Kimberley. France wore striped green and white keeping the traditional blue shorts and red socks. France won 3–1.\nThe stadium José María Minella is the southernmost World Cup venue located at . Including France vs. Hungary, several matches of the 1978 World Cup were played in this stadium. Mar del Plata is in the south of Buenos Aires Province.\nReferees.\nAs a major CONMEBOL member, Argentina has been represented by match officials in nearly every tournament. In 2006, Horacio Elizondo refereed the final between France and Italy, where he sent off Zinedine Zidane after a headbutt to an opponent. In 2018, Néstor Pitana did it when France played versus Croatia. They are also the only two who refereed the opening game in the same tournament."

        "text": "The County Ground, Beckenham is a cricket ground in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley. The ground is owned by Leander Sports and Leisure and is used as an outground by Kent County Cricket Club for First XI fixtures, as well as for other matches. As of 2019 the Kent Women cricket team played the majority of their matches at the ground.\nThe ground, which is on a site, was first used for first-class cricket in 1954. It hosted two matches during the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup and has been used by Kent as a regular outground since 2003. The ground was redeveloped in 2001–02 and in 2014 and facilities include a 13 pitch square, a 2,048-seater stand, an indoor cricket school and 3G football pitches.\nHistory.\nThe ground was established by Lloyds Bank as its main sports ground in the London area in 1918, having developed facilities at the ground in the early 1920s. The original site served as the base for the bank's sports clubs, including Lloyds Bank Cricket Club and Lloyds Bank RFC. The bank sold the ground, which extended to at its greatest extent, to developers for almost £2 million in September 1999, and it is now operated by Leander Sports and Leisure group.\nThe ground was first used by the Kent First XI in 1954 when it hosted a County Championship match against Gloucestershire in a low-scoring rain-affected draw. Kent had previously played home matches at Foxgrove Road in Beckenham between 1885 and 1905, and played one John Player League match at the nearby Midland Bank Sports Ground in 1970. The county have a tradition of playing at outgrounds in what is now south-east London. Until 1965, Beckenham, along with other parts of south-east London, was part of the county of Kent, and it is treated by the club as being \"Metropolitan Kent\". Grounds in nearby Blackheath, Catford, Crystal Palace and Dartford have all also been used by the club in the past for a total of more than 150 matches; the first match played by the county club after its foundation in 1842 was played at White Hart Field in Bromley.\nThe ground was used for two women's One Day Internationals during the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup but Kent did not use it again until the 2003 season when they again played Gloucestershire in a 2003 ECB National League match and Hampshire in a 2003 Twenty20 Cup match. As of August 2022 it has hosted eight County Championship matches and 15 List A matches, but has mainly been used by Kent for Twenty20 cricket, most commonly matches against near neighbours Surrey. Notable matches include a one-day game against the touring West Indians in 2004 and the 2008 Friends Provident Trophy quarter final, a game which had to be moved from the county's usual base at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury due to heavy rainfall.\nIn 2017 a new Kent record for the highest partnership for any first-class wicket was set by Sean Dickson and Joe Denly who made 382 runs for the second wicket against Northants. Kent's total score of 701 for 7 declared was their second highest in any first-class match and their highest on a home ground. Dickson's score of 318 was the second highest score in Kent's history and only the third score of 300 or more to have been made by a Kent player for the county. It is the highest individual score made on a home ground by a Kent player.\nThe County Ground is also used by Kent's second XI and junior sides as well as being the main ground used by the Kent Women cricket team. Two matches in May 2017 saw Sri Lanka play Scotland in preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy and West Indies A played India A in a four-day first-class match on the ground in July 2018.\nGround development.\nAs a result of the sale of the ground in 1999, its main gates, which are a war memorial commemorating the members of Lloyds Bank who died in World War I and World War II, were removed and stored at the bank's Lombard Street headquarters in central London. They have since been moved to the sports ground at the bank's management training centre in Solihull.\nFollowing the sale of the ground, the facilities were redeveloped by Leander Sports and Leisure, working with Kent and Bromley London Borough Council. A new pavilion was constructed with the aim of turning the ground into a centre of excellence for sports in south-east London. The plans were backed by the Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London at the time. Initial plans were for Kent to return to the ground during 2001, although the first match played at the newly developed ground was in 2003. As part of the development 42 flats were built on the site which is designated as Metropolitan Open Land. Kent's matches at Beckenham were partly supported by Bromley Council from 2006.\nFurther redevelopment of the ground took place in 2014, partly to provide the opportunity to increase revenue from non-cricket activities as the site was making a loss for the cricket club. Kent had played no matches on it in 2013 and would have pulled out of the ground if the development had not gone ahead. They returned in 2015 with six days of cricket scheduled, including a County Championship match and two NatWest t20 Blast fixtures. The £30 million redevelopment has seen the club open a new indoor cricket centre and a function centre and the ground now features a permanent 2,048-seat spectator stand and all-weather sports facilities. The ground adjoins the training facilities used by Crystal Palace Football Club who make some use of the all-weather facilities on the site. A new digital scoreboard has been installed at the ground and the outfield has been improved.\nThe ground owners, Leander Sports and Leisure, built 48 houses on part of the site in order to fund the redevelopment which includes a number of year-round facilities including an indoor cricket school, 3G football pitches and a physiotherapy clinic. Redevelopment was seen as essential in order to keep the ground as a financially viable cricketing venue, with the aim of developing a significant base for Kent in the north-west of the county, to develop younger cricketers and as a general sports development hub in metropolitan Kent. Kent took an initial 20-year lease on the ground and have the aim of further developing the ground in the future.\nIn February 2024 Kent's Chief Executive Simon Storey confirmed that the club were exploring the possibility of hosting a third-London based side in The Hundred at Beckenham, amid plans for an expansion from an 8-team to a 10-team competition.\nTransport.\nThe ground is around north of Beckenham town centre with the main entrance on the Worsley Bridge Road. The A2015 road runs to the east of the ground whilst the Mid-Kent railway line is around to the west. Lower Sydenham railway station and New Beckenham railway station, on the Mid-Kent line, Beckenham Hill railway station on the Catford Loop Line and Beckenham Junction station on the Chatham Main Line and Tramlink are all located within of the ground.\nThe ground is on London Buses route 54 and route 352. Around 350 car parking spaces are available on the ground on match days.\nRecords on the ground.\nAs of August 2023, nine first-class, 17 List A and 23 Twenty20 men's matches have been held on the ground. Other than one first-class match between West Indies A and India A in July 2018, all of these matches have featured Kent as the home team. Two women's One Day International matches were held at the ground in 1993, the ground has been used by Kent's women's side and the South East Stars, one of the eight regional sides in English domestic women's cricket, have played matches on it.\nThe ground has tended to produce \"flat, white wickets\" which favour batting and a number of Kent's batting records have been set on the ground.\n\"All records last updated 15 May 2022\"\nFirst-class cricket.\nKent's record partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket, second highest team score in first-class cricket and second highest individual score in first-class cricket were all set on the ground in July 2017 against Northants. The score of 701/7 declared set the team's highest score on a home ground and included only the third triple-century scored by a player playing for Kent, Sean Dickson's 318 runs. The best bowling in a match for Kent was the 7/74 taken by Azhar Mahmood against Gloucestershire in 2009.\nList A cricket.\nThe highest List A score on the ground was set by Durham in 2021. Their score of 405/4 surpassed the previous best, Kent's 384/8 against Surrey in June 2018 which had equalled Kent's highest List A score and set a new record for their highest score in a 50 over match and against a first-class county. Darren Stevens' 6/25 taken in the match against Surrey are the best bowling figures on the ground. The match also saw Kent record their highest margin of victory in terms of runs in List A cricket, winning by 220 runs.\nThe highest individual score on the ground is the 181 scored by Hampshire batsman Tom Prest in 2021. In 2021 Durham's Graham Clark, who scored 141 not out, and Alex Lees scored 242 runs for the first-wicket against Kent, a new record for any wicket on the ground in List A cricket.\nTwenty20 cricket.\nKent's match against Gloucestershire in 2011 saw the only T20 century scored on the ground, Azhar Mahmood scoring 106 not out as Kent won by eight wickets. Wahab Riaz, in his debut for the county, took the only T20 five-wicket haul on the ground which included Kent's second T20 hat-trick. Wahab's figures of 5/17 remained Kent's best T20 bowling figures until 2017 when Adam Milne took 5/11 against Somerset at Taunton."

        "text": "William John Tobin (May 20, 1895 – May 8, 1963) was a Canadian ice hockey player, executive and head coach. He was a senior executive with the Chicago Black Hawks for the team's first 36 years of existence, also serving as coach for parts of two seasons. From 1946 to 1950, he was also the team's principal owner.\nPersonal information.\nTobin was born in Ottawa, Ontario. Tobin died in Chicago's Mercy Hospital of emphysema. He was survived by his wife Muriel, son Donald W. and daughter Mrs. Elaine Bovaird, all of Chicago, and two sisters, Mrs. Maude Sunderland and Mrs. Gertrude Ashe, both of Ottawa.\nIce hockey career.\nTobin was a goaltender for several senior hockey teams of the Ottawa City Hockey League before signing with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Big-4 League in Alberta. His signing provoked a controversy that helped to end the league. Tobin's eligibility to play for the Eskimos was questioned and an inquiry was held. The Calgary Tigers, upset with the makeup of the panel which investigated Tobin's status, refused to accept the decision and refused to play the league championship against Edmonton. Calgary broke from league affairs along with other Calgary teams, leading to the league to fold. Tobin played from the 1920–21 season until 1924–25 with Edmonton, which moved to the Western Canada Hockey League.\nIn 1926, Tobin helped found the new Chicago Black Hawks organization. He'd traveled to Chicago after spending most of the previous year out of hockey, and hoped to find a job. Founder and owner Major Frederic McLaughlin made Tobin his assistant and head of hockey operations. Tobin was head coach of the Black Hawks for parts of two seasons, 1929–30 and 1931–32. He was promoted to team president in 1938. He was included on the Stanley Cup team picture with Chicago as executive in 1934 and 1938. However, his name was only included on the Cup in 1938.\nIn 1941, Tobin took over the independent Kansas City Americans of the American Hockey Association, later in the United States Hockey League. Tobin operated the team until 1951, when it became part of the Black Hawks' organization.\nAfter McLaughlin's death, Tobin nominally headed a syndicate that bought the Hawks from the McLaughlin estate. However, it was an open secret in NHL circles that Tobin was a stand-in for Detroit Red Wings owner James E. Norris, who helped Tobin put together his syndicate. Norris had been the Black Hawks' landlord since 1936, when he bought Chicago Stadium. While NHL rules prohibited the ownership of multiple teams by one owner, the arrangement effectively allowed Norris to control the two teams. In 1950, Tobin sold his share of the Hawks to James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz. He remained vice president and head of hockey operations until 1954, when Tommy Ivan became general manager. He retained the title of vice-president of the team after the sale, until his death in 1963."

He returned to the NHL Toronto club, renamed the Toronto St. Pats, as head coach for its 1920–21 season.

An international match can be played \"between senior/open age or restricted age-level teams from different countries\".\nRecognition.\nMembers of the international governing body can make their own recognition of a match as having test status. It is possible for a match to be considered a test by one side but not the other. Matches may also be given test status retrospectively by their governing bodies.\nA notable instance of a different in opinions of the status of past matches is a consequence of the Super League war. The Australian Rugby League does not recognise the games played in 1997 by the Australian Super League side against Great Britain and New Zealand. The three sides were representing members of the Super League International Board, the ARL's rival. The five matches, two against New Zealand (the inaugural Anzac Test and an end of season match) and a three test tour of England against Great Britain (Super League Test series) are recognised by the Rugby League International Federation, Rugby Football League and New Zealand Rugby League as tests. There have been calls for the Super League Tests to be included in the ARL's records but ARL Chief Executive Geoff Carr said in 2010, \"All historians, and the NRL, agree this is the way it should be treated\". ARL historian David Middleton has stated that those players who joined Super League did so in the knowledge that they were forfeiting their chance of representing the established national team.\nThe first official rugby league international took place on 1 January 1908 when Wales defeated New Zealand 9–8 at the Aberdare Athletic Ground in Aberdare, Wales in front of approximately 15,000 fans. The match was the 29th game of the 1907–08 All Golds tour."

        "text": "Arundel Castle Cricket Ground is a cricket ground in Arundel, West Sussex, England, nearby to Arundel Castle. It has been in use since 1952. The ground was first used by the Sussex 1st XI in 1972 for limited-over matches and in 1990 for County Championship matches. As of the end of the 2015 English cricket season, Arundel Castle has hosted 32 first-class matches, 20 List A matches, and 5 T20 matches.\nCricket history.\nMany matches have been played at the ground over the years by Sussex, often as part of the Arundel Festival, an annual event held in August. Arundel Castle's first List A match was a 1972 match between Sussex and Gloucestershire in the John Player League. Gloucestershire won the match by 2 wickets, helped by a five-wicket haul from Mike Procter. In 1990, Arundel Castle hosted its first County Championship match. The match was between Sussex and Hampshire and ended in a draw, after Colin Wells scored a century for Sussex and Chris Smith scored a century for Hampshire.\nThe ground has hosted some tour matches, and also MCC matches against international A sides. The first of these matches was in 2000 as part of Zimbabwe's tour of England against a West Indians team. The match ended in a draw, with West Indians Sherwin Campbell, Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul all scoring centuries, as well as Zimbabwe and Sussex cricketer Murray Goodwin. In 2002, Arundel Castle hosted a drawn match between Indians and West Indies A and in 2003 it hosted a drawn match between India A and South Africans. The ground hosted MCC matches against the Australians in 2001, the West Indians in 2004, and Sri Lanka A in 2007; the MCC lost all three matches.\nIn June 2010, the Unicorns hosted Sussex in a match at Arundel Castle. The Unicorns chased down Sussex's score of 325/4 from 40 overs, scoring 327/4, which at the time was the highest successful run chase in the history of 40-over cricket. Batsman Wes Durston scored 117 from 68 balls for the Unicorns.\nIn 2015, a T20 match between Sussex and Surrey was abandoned after Surrey cricketers Moisés Henriques and Rory Burns collided with each other whilst attempting a catch. Both players were subsequently hospitalised.\nIn 2020, Hampshire played their home games in the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy at Arundel as their normal home venue of the Rose Bowl in Southampton was in use by England for Test matches.\nOther history.\nIn September 2003, Zoological Society of London released 1,000 crickets – specifically \"Gryllus campestris\", the endangered British field cricket – into the wild at the Arundel Castle ground and another undisclosed location in West Sussex.\nIn 2012, \"The Sunday Telegraph\" included Arundel Castle in their list of \"Britain's best 5 cricket grounds\", calling it a \"great stop on a family day out in the Sussex countryside.\" In 2015, \"The Independent\" listed the ground in the 10 most picturesque outgrounds to watch County Cricket.\nRecords.\nFirst-class cricket records.\nSource:\nList A cricket records.\nSource:"

In 1953, the Bruins again lost only one regular season game, 20–21 at Stanford on October 17; Stanford was later defeated by USC on November 7. With the Rose Bowl again on the line for both teams, UCLA defeated USC 13–0 to win the Pacific Coast Conference outright and gain the New Year's Day berth in Pasadena.\nGame summary.\nThis was the first meeting between the two schools. It was the first Rose Bowl appearance for the Spartans; they had previously only played in the 1938 Orange Bowl. It was the third bowl appearance for the Bruins, all in the Rose (1943, 1947). The weather was sunny; the Spartans wore their green home jerseys and the Bruins wore their white road jerseys.\nMichigan State fumbled twice in the first half, which allowed the Bruins the first two scores. The Spartans had only one completed pass and 56 yards in the first half; they scored a touchdown with 4:45 remaining in the first half.\nVictor Postula knocked down four Bruin passes; head coach Biggie Munn instituted a \"split-line offense\" against the Bruins.\nThe Spartans assembled two long drives in the third quarter to pull ahead 21–14. The Bruins recovered another Spartan fumble and scored to pull within a point at 21–20, but the extra point kick failed. Billy Wells of Michigan State returned a punt 62 yards for a touchdown with 4:51 left in the game.\nGame facts.\nIn their first official season in the Big Ten, the Spartans led the league in the number of black players. Michigan State's eight black athletes represented nearly a quarter of all African Americans in the entire conference."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1978 introduced a new system that would continue to 1994. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected Eddie Mathews. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected Addie Joss and Larry MacPhail. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 7, 1978, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nThe special committee on Negro leagues had disbanded after its 1977 meeting. Two of its members were appointed to the Veterans Committee, as part of expanding that body from twelve to eighteen members. Its responsibilities were extended to cover the Negro leagues, which would continue until the next reform in 1994.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1958 or later, but not after 1972; the ballot included candidates from the 1977 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1972. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 36 players; a total of 379 ballots were cast, with 285 votes required for election. A total of 2,779 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.33 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nRoberto Clemente, who died following the 1972 season, was included on the 1973 ballot under a standard provision for players who die before the five-year waiting period has elapsed.\nThe newly-eligible players included 18 All-Stars, 11 of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 39 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 7-time All-Star Bill Mazeroski and 5-time All-Stars Hoyt Wilhelm and Maury Wlls. The field included two MVPs (Wills and Denny McLain), one Cy Young Award winner (Denny McLain, who received the MVP the same year as one of his two Cy Young Awards; that same season, he was the last pitcher to win thirty games in a season) and two Rookies of the Year (Ron Hansen and Gary Peters). Bill Mazeroski also had eight Gold Gloves at Second Base, the record at the time.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Ted Abernathy, Joe Azcue, John Bateman, Wade Blasingame, Don Buford, Donn Clendenon, Tony Cloninger, Moe Drabowsky, Joe Gibbon, Tom Haller, Steve Hamilton, Ron Hansen, Joe Horlen, Julián Javier, Denny Lemaster, J. C. Martin, Don Mincher, Gary Peters, Phil Regan, Jim Roland, Ron Taylor, Stan Williams, and Bobby Wine.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nGordon Cobbledick (1898–1969) and Edgar Munzel (1907–2002) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring baseball writers. The awards were voted at the December 1977 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1978 ceremonies."

Listed at and , he threw and batted right-handed.\nBiography.\nBorn in 1903 in Prescott, Arkansas, Moore attended Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, where he played college baseball during 1923–1925.\nMoore began his professional baseball career in 1928 with the Little Rock Travelers, a Class A team in the Southern Association. He pitched to a 15–21 win–loss record and 4.13 earned run average (ERA). Late in the season, he made his major league debut on September 21, pitching one game for the Cleveland Indians. Moore pitched a complete game but took the loss as the Indians were defeated by the Washington Senators, 2–1. Moore again pitched primarily for Little Rock in 1929, accruing a 6–20 record with 3.53 ERA. He appeared in two major league games with Cleveland, making two relief appearances without registering a decision.\nIn 1930, Moore went 15–13 for Little Rock with a 4.34 ERA. He appeared in nine games (five starts) that season with the Chicago White Sox, pitching to a 3.60 ERA with a 2–1 record. He is not to be confused with outfielder Jimmy Moore, who also played for the 1930 White Sox, although at different times during the season. Moore spent all of 1931 with the White Sox, making 33 appearances (four starts) with a 4.95 ERA and an 0–2 record. In 1932, Moore pitched for the Toledo Mud Hens, a Double-A team in the American Association, registering a 6–8 record in 31 games. He made his final major league appearance that season, pitching one inning for the White Sox in an April 23 loss to the St. Louis Browns.\nMoore appeared in a total of 46 major league games over parts of five seasons, posting a 2–4 record with 4.52 ERA and 29 strikeouts in innings pitched; he had three complete games and one save. Moore's professional career continued through 1938, as he pitched for the New Orleans Pelicans in the Southern Association in 1933, then spent five years in the Texas League, records of which are incomplete.\nAt age 39 during World War II, Moore was living in Oklahoma City and working at Midwest Air Depot (now Tinker Air Force Base). He married Vera May Montgomery in July 1943 in Oklahoma City. Moore died in 1973 at the age of 69 in Seattle, Washington, and was buried in Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, Colorado."

Tiger Woods won his third U.S. Open and 14th major title, defeating Rocco Mediate on the first hole of sudden-death, following an 18-hole With this victory, Woods joined Jack Nicklaus as the only two players to win the career grand slam three times. The U.S. Open was held at the Torrey Pines Golf Course for the first time, on its South Course.\nIt was an unlikely victory for Woods, who entered the tournament considerably short of match practice and was plagued throughout the week by an ailing left knee. Two days after the championship, Woods revealed that he would miss the remainder of the 2008 season after undergoing knee surgery; this was his last win in a major championship until the 2019 Masters.\nThis was the final 18-hole playoff at the U.S. Open. A two-hole aggregate playoff was introduced by the United States Golf Association (USGA) \nField.\nAbout half the field each year consists of players who are fully exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open.

Players outside the top 60 and ties and outside ten strokes of the leader will be \"cut\" after 36 holes.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 12, 2008\"\nThe leaders after the first round were two little-known American players, Justin Hicks, a 33-year-old Nationwide Tour player, and Kevin Streelman, a 29-year-old PGA Tour rookie. They both shot 3 under-par 68s to lead four other players at 69 (−2), including the 2006 champion, Geoff Ogilvy. The top three ranked players in the world were paired together for the first two rounds, but none of them broke par for the day: Woods 72 (+1), Phil Mickelson 71 (E), Adam Scott 73 (+2). Woods was playing his first event since the Masters, after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, and Scott was playing with a broken little finger on his right hand. The World Golf Rankings were also used for three other pairings, making four pairings include the top 12 golfers in the world. Defending champion Ángel Cabrera shot 79 (+8). Mark Calcavecchia withdrew after playing nine holes with an injured knee and foot. In all, 11 players shot sub-par rounds and the scoring average was 75.58.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 13, 2008\"\nThe first round co-leaders both fell well down the leaderboard: Justin Hicks shot an 80 (+9) to drop to a tie for 49th and Kevin Streelman shot 77 (+6) to drop to tied for 22nd. Stuart Appleby carded a 70 (−1) to take the lead at 139 (−3), one stroke ahead of Robert Karlsson, Mediate, and Woods. Woods shot a 30 on the front nine, one stroke more than the U.S. Open record for nine holes set by Vijay Singh in 2003. Singh made his 14th consecutive cut at the U.S. Open, the longest current streak. Miguel Ángel Jiménez shot the low round of the day −5 (66) and moved into a tie for 5th.\nThe cut was at +7 (149), 10 strokes from the leader, and 80 players made the cut. Defending champion Cabrera shot a 76 (+5) for at total of 155 (+13) to miss the cut by six shots. Ian Poulter withdrew with a wrist injury after playing 15 holes. Three amateurs made the cut: Derek Fathauer (+4), Michael Thompson (+5), and Rickie Fowler (+7).\nIn all, 19 players shot sub-par second rounds. The scoring average was 74.96 for round two and 75.27 overall.\nAmateurs: \"Fathauer (+4), Thompson (+5), Fowler (+7)\", Stanley (+8), Taylor (+10), Tway (+11), Cox (+15), Wilson (+17), Henderson (+21), Wolstenholme (+23), Quagliano (+25).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 14, 2008\"\nOvernight leader Stuart Appleby shot 79 (+8) to slip back to T-19 at 218 (+5), while playing partner Rocco Mediate shot 72 (+1) to finish two strokes behind at 212 (−1). Many of the leaders struggled on day three. Karlsson and Jiménez dropped back to 215 (+2), Davis Love III to 4 over-par and D. J. Trahan to 1 over-par. Lee Westwood finished at 211 (−2) after a round of 70, the only one to shoot par or better in all three rounds. Woods, despite struggling with his knee injury, dazzled on the back nine with some improbable shots, resulting in two eagles and a chip-in birdie from the rough on the 17th to take the 54-hole lead at 210 (−3), a stroke ahead of Westwood. Brandt Snedeker shot the low round of the day at 68 (-3). In total, 11 players shot sub-par rounds and the scoring average for the round was 74.36 and 75.08 overall.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 15, 2008\"\nWoods had previously won each of the thirteen major championships in which he entered the final round with at least a share of the lead, and his fourteenth was no different. He lost his lead on the first hole, double-bogeying the hole for the third time in the tournament, and followed that with a bogey on the second, but regained two of the shots with birdies on 9 and 11. He also bogeyed 13, the same hole on which he had sunk an eagle putt the previous day.\nMediate had put together a solid round, only scoring one bogey over the final 13 holes. However, he barely missed a birdie putt on 17 and hit a wedge too strong on 18; his pars on the two final holes kept both Woods and his playing partner Westwood in contention. Both came to the par-5 final hole one shot behind Mediate, who was in the clubhouse at 283 (−1).\nWoods and Westwood both hit their drives into bunkers and had to lay up. Woods' second shot went into the rough; Westwood laid up in the fairway. Both reached the green with their third shots, leaving them with birdie putts to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate. Westwood's putt, which had a severe break to the right, was not successful. Woods' putt was closer at , with a much less severe break; his putt lipped the hole before dropping and putting him in the playoff. Both Woods and Mediate became the first to finish under par at the U.S. Open since 2004.\nHeath Slocum shot the low round of the day (and the tournament) at 65 (−6). In total, 12 players shot sub-par rounds and the scoring average for the round was 72.87 and 74.71 overall.\nAmateurs: Thompson (+8), Fowler (+13), Fathauer (+15).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nPlayoff.\n\"Monday, June 16, 2008\"\nThe 18-hole playoff was the first playoff for the U.S. Open since 2001. After trading the lead three times on the front nine, Woods built a three stroke lead through ten holes. Mediate rallied on the back nine with three consecutive birdies which gave him a one stroke lead heading to the 18th hole. Like the day before, Woods birdied to tie Mediate and forced the playoff into sudden-death, the third in U.S. Open history (1990, 1994; previously, extra full rounds were played, with the last in 1946).\nThe sudden-death playoff started and ended at the par-4 7th hole; Woods left his birdie putt inches short and tapped in, while Mediate's tee shot found the left fairway bunker and his putt to save par missed right.\nThe playoff started at noon Eastern on ESPN, with NBC taking over at 2 p.m. Eastern and showing the final ten holes; ESPN's two hours earned the highest ever ratings for golf coverage on cable at the time, while NBC had the highest-rated Monday golf broadcast since 1978.\nWith the win, Woods kept his unbeaten streak alive when he has at least a share of the lead heading into the final round of a major championship (14−0). The streak ended at the PGA Championship in 2009.\nWoods' injury.\nTwo months earlier on April 15, Woods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. During his rehab, Woods sustained a double stress fracture of his left tibia. Throughout the tournament it was clear Woods was in pain, and the general feeling was that he was just returning from the initial surgery too soon. He did not reveal the news about the fracture until Wednesday, two days after the Monday He had surgery to repair his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and needed time to rehab that and the stress fracture, and announced on his website that he would miss the remainder of the 2008 season."

His batting average was the second-highest in the league. Holyoke finished the year ranked second among the eight teams competing for the International Cup.\nIn 1880, Powell played first base for the Washington, D.C., team in the National Association. The team finished in first place in their league, and Powell had a .292 batting average and 74 total bases in 48 games. The National Association disbanded after the 1880 season, and Powell began the 1881 season with the Washington baseball club which that year joined the Eastern Championship Association.\nMajor leagues.\nIn the middle of June 1881, Powell was recruited by Frank Bancroft to join the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He replaced first baseman Lew Brown who had been released by the team for alcohol and disciplinary reasons. Upon joining the Wolverines, Powell was described as being six feet tall, \"rather spare in build, although weighing 175 pounds, brown hair and eyes and gentlemanly in appearance.\" In his rookie season at Detroit, Powell compiled a .338 batting average and .380 on-base percentage, both of which led the Detroit team and ranked second in the National League behind Cap Anson. He stayed with the Detroit club for three full seasons, batting .240 in 1882 and .273 in 1883. He also led the National League in 1883 in both double plays (62) and errors at first base (54).\nIn 1884, Powell jumped to the newly formed Union Association, playing for the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds. He compiled a .319 batting average in 43 games for the Outlaw Reds.\nIn 279 games over five major league seasons, Powell compiled a .283 batting average with 213 runs scored, 43 doubles, 11 triples, three home runs, and 115 runs batted in.\nLater years.\nAfter the 1884 season, Powell retired from baseball due to impaired health and went into business with his brother. He died of consumption (an outdated term usually referring to tuberculosis) at his home in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, in February 1888. He was 31 years old at the time of his death. Following his death, a writer in the \"Sporting Life\" noted: \"Martin Powell was a model man, a kind friend, a devoted Catholic, loved and respected by all.\" He was buried at St. Bernard's Cemetery."

        "title": "Cycling in Sydney",
        "text": "Cycling in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia takes place for recreation, commuting and as a sport. Sydney has a hilly topography and so may require a slightly higher level of fitness from cyclists than flatter cities such as Melbourne and Canberra. Sydney depends heavily on motor vehicles where traffic and public transport operate at capacity. This means that cyclist are often competing with motorists for limited space on busier roads, and for limited government resources for expenditure on road infrastructure. In its favour, Sydney has a generally mild climate and there are active cycling groups.\nIn 2015 the NSW Government enacted legislation that increased fines for many offences that are considered by some as trivial or even legal in most other countries, such as riding without a helmet.\nCycling in Australia has, until recently, been a minority interest sport, and hostility on the road is also common. One Danish cyclist, Thomas Andersen, who had cycled around the world for four years, more than 30,000 kilometres through 25 countries from Europe to Asia to Australia to South America, singled out Sydney in 2014 as being the worst city he had visited for cyclists.\nSydney cycling network.\nFor the most part, cyclists ride on the road with motor vehicles (current regulations only permit cyclists under 16 years old to ride on the footpath. Historically, bicycle infrastructure was largely constructed in areas for recreational riding or along shared paths such as in parks. Prior to the involvement of Jan Gehl, the City of Sydney created a Bicycle Action Plan in 2007, part of which involved building physically separated cycleways. In May 2009, the first of these, a 200m stretch along King Street in the CBD opened. In the following decade the number of commuter cycling trips doubled and the City of Sydney produced a Cycling Strategy and Action Plan 2018 - 2030. The plan sets out to prioritise connecting the cycleway network, supporting people to ride, supporting business to support their employees to ride and to lead by example.\nSubsequently, longer segregated paths have been built along selected routes through the city. There had been plans to extend these separated routes, however these have largely not gone ahead, and some important commuter paths, like the College Street bike path, have actually been removed in 2015 at the insistence of Duncan Gay, the former Minister for Roads, Maritime and Freight (who has openly described himself as \"the biggest bike lane sceptic in government\") with the support of Mike Baird, a former Premier of New South Wales.\nAnother criticism of Sydney's separated paths is that the traffic lights preference cars over both pedestrians and cyclists. Not only are cyclists critical of the reported difficulty in triggering a light change, they are also unhappy that priority is afforded to cars by default, in much the same way that pedestrians must push a button before being included in the traffic light sequence.\nCoinciding with the City of Sydney's new investment in cycleways, the state of NSW has repeatedly released statewide plans for bicycle infrastructure, including in 2010, BikePlan NSW. The plan is acknowledged by Bicycle NSW, but thought to be underfunded by local bicycle groups. While premier of NSW, Kristina Keneally bicycle commuted 10 km each way from the suburb of Pagewood to the CBD.\nParticipation.\nThe National Walking and Cycling Participation Survey for 2023 found the following participation rates for cycling in Sydney \nPlanning and government.\nLocal government.\nOne of the aims of BikePlan 2007–2017 is increasing total percentage trips in the city from 2% to 5% by 2011.\nAside from building cycleways, City of Sydney has engaged in a publicity campaign, \nsubsidised cycling courses, installed parking rings throughout the city and subsidised bicycle parking at City of Sydney events which also fund BIKESydney (the local BUG). New development controls have been suggested which, among other things, require increasing bicycle facilities in residential and commercial properties. The City of Sydney's '2030 Sustainable Sydney' plan (2008) has a section dedicated to cycling.\nCooperation with other associations is often required. For example, the two bridges leading into the CBD are controlled by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (Pyrmont Bridge), and the RMS (Sydney Harbour Bridge). The NSW government, through the RMS, control all traffic lights (including along cycleways), arterial roads and speed limits. Although there are plans to limit major CBD roads to private cars, on-going efforts to make the city more friendly to non-motorised transport are made through agreements with the NSW state government.\nOther city councils also have bicycle plans of varying scope, based on funding, local demand, and current facilities. In July 2010, Parramatta City Council installed secure bicycle storage area in their city areas, while proposing to reduce overall funding for cycling facilities.\nMany councils maintain detailed information about cycling in their region. Some examples are: \nState government.\nTransport for NSW is the state responsible for road infrastructure and safety. Their latest bike plan was produced in 2022.\nRegulations.\nIt is not uncommon for bicycles to be allowed thoroughfare where cars are not. These may be labelled \"bicycles excepted\", \"shared zones\" etc. Contraflow lanes have been installed on some one-way streets specifically for bicycles.\nGroups.\nBicycle NSW is a member-based association representing bicycle users across New South Wales since 1976 and boasts a membership of 15,000+ members, supporters and subscribers. Launched as the Bicycle Institute of NSW to advocate for the use of bicycles for transport, they continue to advocate for the essential infrastructure and education to improve rider safety, and host a series of events to increase participation and rider experiences. Membership of Bicycle NSW includes personal accident and third party liability insurance when riding and a range of other benefits.\nBike Sydney is a not-for-profit community Bicycle User Group (BUG) organisation established in 2000 to lobby state and local government and has since expanded beyond advocacy and is involved in cycling events and services around Sydney.\nBicycle Network, originally Bicycle Victoria, is one of the largest cycling membership organisations in the world, with 45,000 members in 2015.\nBUGs.\nMany local Bicycle User Groups (BUGs) operate to assist and advocate for cyclists through an official Affiliation or friendly association with Bicycle NSW. Bicycle NSW maintains a list of BUGs across NSW. A rides calendar is also available.\nCooperatives.\nSydney has several community based bicycle cooperatives or organisations. Their activities include repair workshops, bike recycling, training and education.\nOther groups.\nAs interest in cycling grows, increasing numbers of informal interest groups have emerged, such as Sydney Cycle Chic, and Sydney Bicycle Film Festival. Others exist as Facebook groups including \"I Love Sydney Bike Lanes\" and \"Cycleways\".\nMaps and routes.\nMany councils provide cycling maps in paper and downloadable format. The NSW government provides a similar service\nSeveral collaborative mapping services are available, some using Google Maps for their base layer\nBike riding experiences are published in these magazines.\nInternet.\nSeveral groups have active discussion boards and web sites.\nPublic transport.\nDue to Sydney's geography, trains and ferries complement cyclists well. For example, trains can take you to the start of some great cycling rides in Ku Ring Gai Chase National Park, or a ferry across Sydney harbour can shorten a cycling trip by not having to rely on limited bridge crossings. Ferry wharves are also frequently beyond walking distance from surrounding facilities.\nTravelling with a bicycle.\nBicycles are permitted free of charge on Sydney Trains, Sydney Metro and Sydney Ferries. Ferry access is subject to availability of space. They are not permitted on Sydney Buses.\nBicycle Storage.\nThere's a growing number of bike sheds and lockers at train stations, ferry wharves and bus interchanges.\nTrains.\nSydney Trains railway stations have an uneven amount of bicycle parking\nThose transporting a bicycle on a train will notice that not all stations have ramps or lifts to get to the train platform.\nMost city trains do not have specific provision for bicycles, aside from the vestibule area. Intercity trains operating Newcastle, the Blue Mountains and the South Coast frequently have a single hook at the end of the carriage.\nFerries.\nPrivate operators may allow bicycles on board, sometimes for a fee, but it is worth checking before travelling. Private ferry services include: \nLight rail.\nBicycles are allowed on all Light Rail services subject to availability of space. They were also permitted aboard the former Sydney Monorail.\nServices.\nSydney has many cycling focused businesses offering services such as courses to build confidence and learn how to ride safely on road, bicycle fitting, frame and custom building, bicycle hire and guided tours.\nFacilities.\nParking stations.\nThe City of Sydney council offers free parking for bicycles at Goulburn Street and Kings Cross car parks There are also a number of bike sheds and lockers in the city including opal card operated security parking such as at Redfern and Green Square train stations.\nVelodromes.\nSydney has several velodromes including the indoor Dunc Gray Velodrome (Bankstown), which was part of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Outdoor tracks are located Hurstville Oval, Lidcombe Oval, Merrylands Oval and Tempe. Many velodromes have been demolished including sites at Wiley Park, Camperdown and Surry Hills."

        "title": "Egypt national cricket team",
        "text": "The Egypt national cricket team was the team that represented the country of Egypt in international cricket matches. They were active from 1909 until World War II.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket was first played in Egypt in the 19th century, and a cricket club was formed in Alexandria by British residents in 1851. Cricket was very much a recreational activity until the opening of the Suez Canal saw the British population increase (see History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty).\nMore clubs were established by the military, who began to dominate the local game. In October 1884, a combined Army and Navy team played against Alfred Shaw's XI who were on their way to Australia for an Ashes tour.\nInternational matches start.\nBy 1909, cricket had become the main sporting and social activity of the British population, and standards were good enough for the Marylebone Cricket Club to send a team to tour in 1909. A national side was raised for the first time, and the MCC played three matches against them, winning two and losing the other. They also played matches against local clubs in addition to teams representing the military and civilian populations.\nI Zingari toured in March 1914. They played three matches against the national side in addition to matches against Cairo and Alexandria Cricket Club. The matches against the national side saw two draws and one win for the tourists. A return visit of sorts took place later in the year with a combined Egypt/Sudan team playing the MCC at Lord's in a two-day match. The MCC won by ten wickets.\nThe Free Foresters were the third tourists in 1927, playing twice against the national team, losing the first match and drawing the second. One player in the Free Foresters team on the tour was Hubert Martineau, who was to provide regular opposition for Egypt in the forthcoming years.\nMartineau took a team to Egypt every year between 1929 and 1939. The tours typically included two matches against the national side in addition to matches against club and military teams.\nDecline.\nAlthough Egypt were playing matches regularly against Martineau's team, the quality of cricket in the country began to decline in the 1930s. As cricket was dominated by the military, the players changed often, leading to a lack of consistency. Players from the local civilian population were often ignored, and only one native Egyptian ever played for the team.\nMartineau's tours ceased with the outbreak of the Second World War, and whilst cricket was played in the country during the war, the matches were solely recreational activities for troops stationed in the country. The national team never played again after the war.\nAttempts were made to resurrect cricket in the country, with an Egyptian club team touring England in 1951, and playing the MCC at Lord's. Omar Sharif, the filmstar and bridge player, was a member of that team. The players in these clubs were from the upper classes and supported the Egyptian monarchy, leading to little support for cricket when the monarchy was abolished in 1953. The new government took no interest in the game and cricket began a steady decline, with schools stopping their teaching of the game. Gezira Sporting Club played a match against the visiting Pakistan in 1954, but the match was ended early so that the Pakistan players could visit the pyramids and the Sphinx.\nCricket grounds began to be built over, and it was not until the late 1990s that the game saw a resurgence amongst the Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and British expatriate communities. As of 2001, attempts were being made to reintroduce cricket into schools. A cricket league in Cairo was being played by April 2008 and it is hoped that Egypt will eventually take part in the North West African Championship.\nPlayers.\nThe only native Egyptian to play for the national team was Abdou Hassanein, who took 17 wickets in his two matches. John Traicos, who played Test cricket for South Africa and Zimbabwe, was born in Zagazig, Egypt. The following players played first-class cricket and played for Egypt:"

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1915 through 1924 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds.\nIn 1921, the park (Crosley Field) was in its tenth season and no one had yet hit a ball over the fence without the benefit of a bounce. The first ball to clear the fence on the fly was hit in late May by John Beckwith of the Chicago Giants of the Negro National League. Then on June 2, with the last-place Reds playing the St. Louis Cardinals, Duncan dug in against left-handed hurler Ferdie Schupp with a runner on second and one out. Duncan connected. The ball rocketed toward left field, easily cleared the wall, and Duncan had registered Organized Baseball’s first home run to go out of the park in Redland Field. It cleared the 12-foot concrete wall by four to six feet, and it traveled an estimated 400 feet.\nIn 727 games played, Duncan batted .307 (827-2695) with 23 home runs, 361 runs, and 374 RBI. His best year was 1922 when he hit .328 with 8 home runs and 94 RBI. In the 1919 World Series he hit .269 (7-26) and leading all regulars with 8 RBI."

        "text": "The Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race was a series of non-championship motor races run according to Formula One rules, held at Davidstow Circuit, in Cornwall, UK.\nHistory.\nDavidstow Circuit was built on the site of former Royal Air Force base RAF Davidstow Moor, using the perimeter roads and runways of the airfield, and held its first race meeting in 1952. The circuit was renowned for its poor weather conditions, thick fog and torrential rain being a frequent \noccurrence, and its altitude. The circuit was almost 1000 ft above sea level and situated near Brown Willy, the highest point on Bodmin Moor. Facilities at the track were basic – latrines were dug into the ground, and spectators were separated from the race track by waist-high scaffolding bars.\nThe Formula One race was first held on 7 June 1954 and was staged on two more occasions, a second fixture in 1954 and one in 1955, before the event was abandoned. Following the last of these events the circuit ceased to host motor racing events. These races marked the first victories in Formula One for both Lotus and Connaught.\nAlthough officially classified as Formula One races, the majority of drivers competed in obsolescent 2-litre Formula Two cars. In fact over the course of the three F1 races held at the circuit, only a single Formula One car took part: Leslie Marr drove his streamlined Connaught to a comfortable victory in the 1955 event.\nResults.\nThe Formula One races at Davidstow generally had very small fields due to its remote location and rudimentary facilities. The 1955 event had just six starters, as did the second race of 1954, while the inaugural event saw seven cars on the grid for the start."

        "title": "History of George Mason basketball",
        "text": "George Mason Patriots men's basketball program dates to 1966. Basketball and athletics as a whole have contributed significantly to George Mason's popularity and success. The Patriots are the mascot and logo of George Mason University. The Patriots home court for both the men and women is at the EagleBank Arena, which is in Fairfax Virginia. The Patriots compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Until 2012–13, they competed in the Colonial Athletic Association, better known as the CAA. Both conferences are part of NCAA Division I sports. The men's team is coached by Tony Skinn. The women's team is coached by Nyla Milleson.\nHistory.\nThe Patriots made a transition from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics NAIA to the National Collegiate Athletic Association NCAA Division II, and subsequently into the NCAA Division I rank in the 1978–79 season. According to the history of George Mason basketball, both the men's and women's basketball programs have been fixtures of campus life, and have all been enjoyed by students, parents, faculty, staff, other alumni. Although many of the school's athletic programs are enjoyed by George Mason Patriots and have had many of their own memorable moments, the men's basketball program remains the key sport at the University. The men's basketball team has played at the Patriot Center since 1985, and in prior years played at the PE Building on the west side of the Fairfax Campus. George Mason has sent 3 players to the NBA since 1979. Those being Rob Rose, Ricky Wilson, and Jason Miskiri. George Mason has had numerous basketball players pursue post-college basketball careers overseas over the years, with many George Mason basketball alums still currently continuing their basketball careers overseas.\nNCAA Tournament appearances.\nMen's\nThe Patriots have advanced to the NCAA tournament six times (1989, 1999, 2001, 2006,2008, and 2011) and the NIT tournament (National Invitation tournament) three times (1986, 2002 and 2004). The basketball team is best known for its 2006 NCAA Final Four appearance where Mason beat North Carolina, Connecticut, Michigan State, and Wichita State. The Patriots lost to the eventual champion Florida in the Final Four. After the Patriots run in the 2005–2006 season, and their successful finish in the 2007–2008 season, George Mason Head Coach Jim Larranaga was offered to leave Mason for a 5-year, $4.25 million offer from Providence College. Coach Larranaga announced his decision in April 2008 by declining the offer from Providence, and extending his current contract with Mason to 2015.\nFinal Four.\nGeorge Mason celebrated the 2005–2006 basketball campaign, when they set a school-record by winning 27 games, going 27–8 on the year. That season the patriots were ranked top 25 in the USA Today and ESPN polls for the very first time. George Mason was ranked #8 in the final NCAA Basketball polls that year, making that Mason's highest ever ranking in men's basketball. George Mason was nominated for 2 ESPY awards by ESPN. The Patriots were nominated for an ESPY in the category of \"Best Moment,\" for making the Final Four after downing three highly favored opponents. The run to the Final Four, which ESPN says is \"considered by most the greatest in NCAA Tournament history\", culminated with the Patriots beating top-seeded Connecticut 86–84 in overtime on March 26 to advance to the school, and the CAA conference's first-ever Final Four. George Mason also defeated Michigan State, North Carolina, and Wichita State in the NCAA Tournament while defeating the University of Connecticut in the Elite 8 to earn a trip to the Final Four in Indianapolis. George Mason would later fall to the eventual National Champion, University of Florida, in the Final Four game. While the Patriots were nominated for their virtuoso performance, the man who helped conduct the orchestra was also nominated for an ESPY as George Mason head men's basketball coach Jim Larranaga was nominated in the \"Best Coach/Manager\" category.\nAfter the 2005–2006 season Head coach Jim Larranaga was named Virginia Coach of the Year on June 26, 2006. George Mason was one of only three teams since 1982 without a tournament win in its school history to still enter the final four. Georgia did it in 1983, and Virginia did it in 1981. During the 2005–2006 season the final four had a bigger following than the Super Bowl and the NBA Playoffs that year. The main following came from office pools and parties in houses, dorms, and bars.\nGeorge Mason women's basketball.\nIn 2008, news broke out that women's basketball coach Debbie Taneyhill decided to resign to pursue other opportunities.\nCoach Taneyhill spent 11 seasons as Mason's women's basketball head coach and had much success with the ladies. During Taneyhill's tenure as coach, she helped the lady Patriots to four-straight winning campaigns, from the 2000 to the 2004 season. She also led them to two post-season appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament, WNIT in 2001 and 2004, and was named 2001 Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. \nShe was the sixth coach in George Mason's 33-year history and was the only head coach to have 10 or more wins in each of her first eight seasons. She led the Patriots to the 2004 CAA Championship title game for just the third time in school history. Taneyhill ranks second all-time among Mason coaches in both wins and games coached.\nDuring the 2005–2006 season George Mason University was selected to host the Colonial Athletic Association Women's Basketball Championship, to be played at the Patriot Center. It was the first time that George Mason served as host to the women's championship. In 2003 Mason Guard Jen Derevjanik advanced to the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association). Derevjanik is one of few players ever in Mason's history to play in the WNBA. Jen wrapped up her second season with the WNBA's Connecticut Sun in 2005, where the Sun's competed in the WNBA finals for the second straight season. Derevjanik is the first Mason player to be part of a team that has advanced to the WNBA Finals.\nPlayers.\nNotable player accomplishments.\nCAA PLAYER OF THE YEAR\nCAA ROOKIE OF THE YEAR\nALL-CAA (ECAC South Conf., 1980–85)"

While the DEL is an independently operated league, the other two are run by the German ice hockey federation, the DEB, through the ESBG. The leagues below the Oberliga are operated by the state federations (German:\"Landesverbände\") and don't run nationwide. The 2006–07 season for the three top leagues started on 7 September 2006 with the first round in the \"DEL\" and finished on 17 April 2007 with the third and last game of the \"DEL\" finals, with the Adler Mannheim winning their fifth DEL title.\nDeutsche Eishockey Liga, the DEL.\nThe DEL is the highest tier of German ice hockey. The league was played with 14 clubs in the 2006–07 season, the same number as the previous season. However, in place of the Kassel Huskies, who were relegated the previous season, the Straubing Tigers took part in the competition, having won the 2nd Bundesliga in 2005–06. The modus had slightly changed from the 2005–06 season. Each club played the other four times, resulting in 52 regular season games per club. The top six clubs at the end of the regular season are qualified for the first round of the play-offs. The clubs seven to ten play a preliminary round to determine the last two places for the first round. For the teams placed eleven to fourteen, the season had ended. No club was relegated from the \"DEL\" this season but one new club admitted, the EHC Wolfsburg Grizzly Adams, champion of the \"2nd Bundesliga\".\nFinal table.\nThe final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime or penalties, one for a loss after overtime or penalties and no points for an outright loss.\nPlay-offs.\nThe four rounds of the 2006–07 play-offs were played under the following system:\nLike the regular season, in the play-offs games will be decided by penalty shoot-outs (P) after a five-minute overtime (OT) sudden-death. In all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6).\nTop scorers.\nThe five highest placed scores in the regular season and play-offs are:\n2nd Bundesliga.\nThe 2nd Bundesliga is the second highest tier of ice hockey in Germany. The league played with 14 clubs in the 2006–07 season, the same number it had since 2001. Each club played each other four times during the regular season. The top eight teams in the league qualified for the play-offs to determined the 2nd Bundesliga champion who also gained promotion to the DEL this season. For the clubs placed nine and ten, the season has finished after the regular round. The bottom four clubs played out the two relegated teams from the 2nd Bundesliga.\nRegular season.\nThe final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime, one for a loss after overtime and no points for an outright loss.\nPlay-offs.\nThe three rounds of the 2006–07 play-offs were played under the following system:\nIn all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6). Should a game be undecided after regular time, there will be one overtime (OT) in sudden death format. Should there still be no winner, the game is decided through penalties (P).\nPlay-downs.\nThe play downs consists of only one round, played in a best-of-seven format. The two loser of this round are relegated to the Oberliga.\nOberliga.\nThe Oberliga is the third tier of ice hockey in Germany and as such the lowest nationwide level, below it are currently the LEVs (\"Landesverbände\"). In the 2006–07 season the league played with 14 clubs. However, the Ratinger Ice Aliens were excluded from the competition on 16 November 2006 and all results involving the club canceled.\nEach club in the league played each other club four times in the 2006–07 season. The top eight teams then took part in a best-of-seven play-off round to determined the two promoted teams to the 2nd Bundesliga. Because the EHC Wolfsburg was admitted to the DEL, a third Oberliga club was also promoted, this being the SC Riessersee which had been the best placed semi final loser. For the bottom five clubs, the league season was finished after the regular round, due to the expansion of the Oberliga no team was relegated. The teams placed nine to twelve played a cup qualification round however.\nPlay-offs.\nThe Oberliga play-offs were operating on a best-of-seven modus in the first round and semi finals. The finals were played as best-of-three. The winning teams of the semi-finals are promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga.\nSemi finals.\nWinners promoted to 2nd Bundesliga.\nLeagues below the Oberliga.\nThe levels below the Oberliga are not administrated by the DEB but rather by the local federations, the LEVs. With the ESBG's intention to increase the number of clubs in the Oberliga from 13 to 19, seven promotion places were available for the LEV clubs. The league champions and promoted clubs from the regional leagues were:\nRegionalliga West.\nThe Regionalliga West is actually not quite a league but rather a promotion round. It contains the best six teams of the Regionalliga Nordrhein-Westfalen, and the top two teams of the Regionalliga Hessen and the Baden-Württemberg Liga each. The winner of this league is nominally promoted to the Oberliga. As such, the league covers the German states of Baden-Württemberg, Hessen, Saarland, Rheinland-Pfalz and Nordrhein-Westfalen.\nRegionalliga Nordost.\nThis league covers the north and north east of Germany. Again, it is more of a promotion round, compromising nine teams. In an effort to strengthen the sport in the east of Germany, four clubs from this region were promoted to the Oberliga. The \"Regionalliga Nordost\" covers the German states of Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia.\nBayernliga.\nThe Bayernliga is the only single-state league of the three, covering just Bavaria. The reason for this is that the state holds approximately one third of all ice hockey clubs in Germany and 17 of the 41 clubs in the first three divisions in 2006–07 were from this federation."

        "text": "The 1961 Major League Baseball season was played from April 10 to October 12, 1961. That season saw the New York Yankees defeat the Cincinnati Reds in five games in the World Series. The season is best known for Yankee teammates Roger Maris' and Mickey Mantle's pursuit of Babe Ruth's prestigious 34-year-old single-season home run record of 60. Maris ultimately broke the record when he hit his 61st home run on the final day of the regular season, while Mantle was forced out of the lineup in late September due to a hip infection and finished with 54 home runs.\nIn response to the proposed Continental League, the American League expanded by two teams in the first MLB expansion since 1901. The original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins. The American League therefore placed a new team in Washington, also called the Senators. Also, the American League placed a team in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Angels.\nIn order to keep its schedule balanced, the American League season was extended by eight games. Previously, teams had played 154 games (22 games per opponent), but from 1961 AL teams would play opponents 18 times each for a total of 162 games. The National League played a 154-game schedule for the final time in 1961 before switching to 162 games when they also expanded to ten teams for the 1962 Major League Baseball season.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nTelevision coverage.\nCBS and NBC continued to air weekend \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts, while ABC televised several games in prime time. One of ABC's prime time games occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all MLB games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film \"61*\", the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.\nThe All-Star Game and World Series aired on NBC."

        "title": "Eisenhower baseball controversy",
        "text": "The Eisenhower baseball controversy refers to the allegations that the former general and President of the United States, Dwight Eisenhower, played minor league baseball for the Junction City Soldiers in the Central Kansas League the year before he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. The story goes that he did so under the assumed name of \"Wilson.\" The question of whether Dwight Eisenhower played minor-league baseball is not well documented and is subject to various interpretations.\nControversy.\nWhile at the academy, Eisenhower played college football for West Point. This would not be an issue except that in order to play college football, one must have never played a sport for money, because doing so causes forfeiture of an athlete's amateur status. If Eisenhower did in fact play baseball for money, it would have been in violation of the Cadet Honor Code. One source contends that Eisenhower even signed a voucher claiming that he had never played sports for money. The Eisenhower Presidential Library claimed in an e-mail that \"We do not have any documentation as to whether Ike signed a voucher when he arrived at West Point. It would be interesting to see if West Point required this in 1911.\"\nCadet Honor Code.\nThe Cadet Honor Code, formalized in the 1920s, states simply that:\nThough Eisenhower graduated in 1915, before the formalization of the Honor Code, playing amateur football while having formerly been a professional athlete would constitute either lying, cheating, or both. In the early, informal, sometimes characterized as vigilante justice, phase of the Honor System, it is unclear if Eisenhower would have graduated to become an officer in the United States Army.\nEisenhower's love for baseball.\nEisenhower long had aspirations of being a professional baseball player. He is quoted as saying:\nWhen I was a small boy in Kansas, a friend of mine and I went fishing and as we sat there in the warmth of the summer afternoon on a river bank, we talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up. I told him that I wanted to be a real major league baseball player, a genuine professional like Honus Wagner. My friend said that he'd like to be President of the United States. Neither of us got our wish.\nAt West Point, Eisenhower tried out for the baseball team but did not make it. He would later be quoted as saying, \"Not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest.\"\nEvidence.\nThe evidence that exists on the subject of Eisenhower's playing semi-pro baseball consists of quotes and later statements which can be contradictory. In June 1945 during his homecoming trip to the United States at the end of World War II in Europe, General Eisenhower attended a New York Giants game in New York City. According to articles in \"The New York Times\" (June 20, 1945) and \"Life\" (July 2, 1945), he acknowledged in a meeting with the two teams' managers that he had briefly played semi-pro ball in Kansas. He was again quoted as referring to this incident during his visit to Abilene, Kansas, a few days later (\"The New York Times\", June 23, 1945; \"The Wichita Eagle\", June 23, 1945). The \"Times\" quoted him as saying:\nThe Eisenhower Foundation biography includes that \"he may or may have not played semi-professional baseball\" upon a summer return to Abilene after his sophomore term in 1913.\nEisenhower never made it clear what years he played ball and for what teams. His naval aide's wartime diary, \"My Three Years with Eisenhower: The Personal Diary of Captain Harry C. Butcher, USNR\" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1946), mentions that during the war General Eisenhower told his staff and colleagues stories about playing semi-pro baseball.\nEisenhower's early biographer, Kenneth S. Davis (\"Soldier of Democracy\", Doubleday, 1945), relates that it was common for temporary \"town teams\" to be organized to play teams from other towns and that players would split up the gate money at the end of the game. Quite often this would amount to only a few dollars per player.\nAfter his election as president in 1952 there was renewed interest in Eisenhower's sports activities, and he received numerous inquiries regarding his having played semi-pro baseball. The president and his staff either ignored these inquiries or outright denied such activities.\nCharlie Wheatley claimed that he played professional baseball with Eisenhower with the Abilene Reds of the Class D Central Kansas League in 1910. Mel Ott was quoted as saying that \"The General admitted that as a youth he had done so (played semi-pro ball), under the assumed name of Wilson.\" An outfield player by the name \"Wilson\" is listed among the 1911 roster of the Junction City Soldiers minor league team of Junction City, Kansas. He was said to have played in 9 games with 31 at bats and 11 hits for a batting average of .355. He also had 10 putouts in 10 chances for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage.\nReferences.\nMost of this article is based on research conducted by and reproduced with permission from the Eisenhower Presidential Library.\nFrank Sinatra relays the story of \"Wilson\" on \"The Bill Stern Sports Newsreel 07/09/48\" (available from Radio Spirits in the CD collection \"60 Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows Starring Frank Sinatra And Friends\")"

        "title": "UConn Huskies men's basketball",
        "text": "The UConn Huskies men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I men's college basketball team of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. They currently play in the Big East Conference and are coached by Dan Hurley. With six national championships and 45 conference titles, the program is considered one of the blue bloods of college basketball.\nUConn has won six NCAA tournament championships (1999, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023 and 2024), which puts the program in a tie for third-most all time and is the most of any program since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Huskies have won eight Big East tournament championships (tied for most all time) and 11 Big East regular season championships (most all time). UConn has 36 NCAA tournament appearances (tied for 13th-most all time) and has played in seven NCAA Final Fours (10th-most all time), 13 NCAA Elite Eights (11th-most all time) and 19 NCAA Sweet Sixteens (tied for 11th-most all time). UConn won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship in 1988 and the NIT third-place game in 1997, with 13 NIT appearances in total. The Huskies also have one American Athletic Conference tournament championship and two ECAC New England regional tournament championships.\nFrom the Huskies' first game in 1900–01 season to the end of the 2023–24 season, the program has amassed 1,805 wins and compiled a .648 winning percentage, both top 25 in NCAA Division I history. Initially a New England regional powerhouse, UConn won multiple conference championships in the 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including a run of 10-straight Yankee Conference championships from 1951 to 1960. The Huskies appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times between 1939 and 1970 — second-most of any school in the tournament's early era — reaching their first Sweet Sixteen in 1956 and first Elite Eight in 1964. The program began its emergence as a national powerhouse after becoming a charter member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, building steadily from its first national postseason championship in the NIT in 1988 to its first NCAA championship in 1999.\nSince 1999, the Huskies have won six national championships in a span of 25 years, a run only rivaled by UCLA under John Wooden. In 2024, UConn became the eighth school in NCAA Division I history to win back-to-back national championships, and the first to do so in 17 years. After the 2023–24 season, Fox Sports dubbed the Huskies' sustained success \"the greatest run of the 21st century\" and recognized UConn as \"one of the greatest programs in the history of college basketball.\"\nNumerous UConn players have gone on to achieve professional success after their time in Storrs. In 2011, six former Huskies were included in SLAM Magazine's 500 Greatest NBA Players of All-Time: Ray Allen, Richard Hamilton, Clifford Robinson, Caron Butler, Ben Gordon and Emeka Okafor. Kemba Walker is generally regarded as the greatest player in Charlotte Hornets franchise history. Other successful former Huskies include Andre Drummond, Rudy Gay, Donyell Marshall, Toby Kimball, Jeremy Lamb, Charlie Villanueva, Scott Burrell, Travis Knight, Kevin Ollie, Jake Voskuhl, Shabazz Napier, Marcus Williams and Jordan Hawkins.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1901–1946).\nConnecticut Agricultural College played its first organized men's basketball game on February 8, 1901, a 17–12 win against Willimantic High School. The victory led the school to add men's basketball as a varsity sport the following year. The program's first intercollegiate game came in the 1904–05 season, a 66–22 loss to UMass. Connecticut did not have a home court during these early years and eventually ceased competition in 1908 as a result. An independent team was given permission to compete under the school's name from 1910 to 1914. Connecticut resumed sponsorship of men's basketball as a varsity sport in the 1914–15 season following the construction of Hawley Armory, the school's first on-campus basketball court. The Aggies, as they were called at the time, had no coach and posted a 1–4 record on the season.\n1915–1921: John Donahue and Ross Swartz.\nLooking to improve on its performance in the 1914–15 season, Connecticut named John F. Donahue as the program's first head coach. However, he led the team to four losing seasons and an 11–23 overall record. Connecticut named M. Ross Swartz as Donahue's replacement. He posted a 7–5 record in his first year — the school's first winning season since returning basketball as a varsity sport — but finished 7–9 in his second.\n1921–1922: Wilder Tasker.\nWith losing records in five out of the previous six years, Connecticut finally turned the corner when it named J. Wilder Tasker as head coach for the 1921–22 season. The Aggies played their most aggressive schedule to date, and opened the season with a 38–33 win against Harvard in Cambridge. In its second game, the team notched the program's first major upset, a 33–31 win over Army at West Point on December 21, 1921. Army was ranked #3 in the nation that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll, and went undefeated the following year. Connecticut finished the year 15–4 overall, the program's best season to date. Tasker returned for the 1922–23 season but abruptly resigned after the team's first game, a 52–19 loss to Army. He left Connecticut with a 15–5 overall record. Roy J. Guyer coached the remainder of the season, finishing 8–6 as interim head coach.\n1923–1927: Sumner Dole.\nConnecticut named Sumner Dole as head coach ahead of the 1923–24 season. After posting a losing record in his first season, Dole led Connecticut to back-to-back New England Conference championships in 1925 and 1926. Hugh Greer was captain of the 1925–26 team. That season included a 30–26 win over UMass, a team ranked #25 in the country that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. After the 1926–27 season, Dole stepped down as men's basketball head coach, but continued to coach the school's football team. He finished with a 34–22 record over four seasons as head coach.\n1927–1931: Louis Alexander.\nWith Dole shifting his focus to the school's football team, Louis A. Alexander was named Connecticut's first men's basketball-only head coach in 1927. In his first season, Alexander won the school's third New England Conference championship. That season included a 39–36 win over Springfield College, a team ranked #11 in the nation that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Alexander led the team to winning records again in the next two seasons before stepping down halfway through the 1930–31 season. He left Connecticut with a 35–19 overall record. Dole, who was still head coach of Connecticut's football team, coached the remainder of the men's basketball season, posting a 5–3 record as interim head coach and bringing his overall record to 39–25.\n1931–1936: John Heldman Jr..\nConnecticut named John Heldman Jr. head coach ahead of the 1931–32 season. Harrison \"Honey\" Fitch, the program's first African American player, joined the team in the 1932–33 season. Heldman made the controversial decision to bench Fitch in a game against the US Coast Guard Academy in 1934 after Coast Guard refused to play if Fitch was on the floor. Heldman coached the following year, but resigned after the first game of the 1935–36 season, a loss to the school's alumni. Heldman finished with a 19–42 overall record. J. O. Christian coached the remainder of the 1935–36 season, finishing with a 3–10 record as interim head coach.\n1936–1945: Don White.\nAfter five straight losing seasons, Don White was named head coach of the Huskies for the 1936–37 season. Prior to arriving in Storrs, White spent 12 seasons as the head coach at Washington University. He led Connecticut to an 11–7 record in his first year. In the 1940–41 season, the team went 14–2 and won the school's fourth New England Conference championship. One of the first true stars from Connecticut was Hartford's Bernie Fisher, who played under White. He was captain of the 1944–45 team, which was the first Huskies team to play a game in Madison Square Garden. That season also included a 67–59 win over Rhode Island, a team ranked #19 in the country that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. White left Connecticut after eight seasons to become the head coach at Rutgers. He compiled an overall record of 94–59 during his time in Storrs.\n1945–1946: Blair Gullion.\nConnecticut hired Blair Gullion as White's replacement for the 1945–46 season. Gullion spent three seasons as head coach at Tennessee prior to World War II and took over as Connecticut's head coach after returning from his service in the war. He coached the Huskies to an 12–6 record in his first season. At the start of the 1946–47 season, Connecticut joined the newly formed Yankee Conference. Gullion left the team six games into the season to accept a position as Washington University's athletic director, finishing with a 15–8 overall record as head coach.\nHugh Greer era (1946–1963).\nHugh Greer became UConn's head coach after Gullion's midseason departure. Greer, a former player at the school in the 1920s, was in his second season as UConn's freshman team coach when Gullion resigned. Prior to that, Greer had coached at South Windsor's Ellsworth High School, winning five state championships between 1939 and 1945.\nLed by senior Walt Dropo, a three-sport star at the school, the Huskies started the 1946–47 season 4–2 under Gullion, with road losses to rival Rhode Island and an NYU team that appeared in the NCAA tournament the previous year. Gullion resigned after the loss to NYU. The school then asked Greer to helm the team. He led UConn to a perfect 12–0 mark to finish the year, giving the team an overall record of 16–2 on the season. This was the best single season finish in school history to that point.\nIn the 1947–48 season, UConn moved into a new home arena — the Storrs Cage — replacing Hawley Armory. The structure was built by salvaging parts from a World War II airplane hanger, leading to the nickname \"the Hanger.\" This facility had a capacity of 4,000 seats, allowing general admission attendance for the first time. The team's first game in the Storrs Cage was a 63–29 win over Maine in January 1948. The Huskies won their first Yankee Conference title at the end of that season.\nUConn made its first NCAA tournament appearance in the 1950–51 season, where they lost to St. John's 63–52 at Madison Square Garden. The Huskies finished the season with a 22–4 overall record. In 1953–54 season, Greer famously led UConn to a 78–77 victory against undefeated Holy Cross, breaking the Crusaders' 47-game home winning streak and keeping them out of the NCAA tournament. Holy Cross won the NIT title a few weeks later. UConn made its second NCAA tournament appearance and finished the year with a 23–3 overall record.\nThe UConn Field House replaced the Cage as the team's home court at the start of the 1954–55 season. UConn defeated rival Rhode Island in resounding fashion, 116–77, in the field house's inaugural game on December 1, 1954. The Huskies ended the season with their first National Invitation Tournament appearance and a 20–5 overall record. In the 1955–56 season, Greer led UConn to its third NCAA tournament appearance and its first trip to the Sweet Sixteen following an 84–75 win over Manhattan in the first round. The Huskies narrowly lost to Temple 65–59 in the East Regional semifinal game played at Madison Square Garden. UConn made five consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament between 1956 and 1960.\nIn 1960–61, UConn unexpectedly posted the program's first losing season in 17 years. It was the only losing season of Greer's tenure. The reason for the Huskies' struggles became apparent in March 1961, when two players were questioned as part of the 1961 NCAA men's basketball gambling scandal that resulted in the arrest of 37 players from 22 schools. Team captain Pete Kelly and center Glenn Cross were ultimately found to have accepted bribes to shave points throughout the season. Greer was devastated and never recovered from the scandal.\nThe Huskies improved to winning form in the 1961–62 season, but finished one game behind UMass in the race for the Yankee Conference title. Greer died of a heart attack 10 games into the 1962–63 season. His final game was a 92–64 win over Maine, played at the UConn Field House on January 12, 1963. He died two days after and was replaced by assistant coach George Wigton. Wigton and the Huskies posted an 11–3 record through their final 14 regular season games to win the Yankee Conference title and advance to the NCAA tournament for the eighth time in program history.\nUnder Greer, UConn won 12 Yankee Conference titles in 16 seasons, including 10 consecutive titles from 1951 to 1960. Greer also led UConn to its first seven NCAA berths and one NIT appearance while compiling an overall head coaching record of 286–112.\nFred Shabel era (1963–1967).\nUConn named Fred Shabel as Greer's permanent replacement at head coach on April 1, 1963. Shabel previously spent six seasons as an assistant coach at Duke, four of which were under College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Vic Bubas. He played a role in Duke's first Final Four run in 1963 and initially accepted an offer to coach at Rutgers the following season, but withdrew after feeling unprepared to lead their program to success. Instead, he chose to accept an offer from Connecticut, which he believed had a clear path to the NCAA tournament in the Yankee Conference.\nShabel implemented a number of changes that had a significant impact on UConn's program and its culture. He introduced multiple defensive schemes for the first time, began calling offensive sets from the bench and pushed for the creation of the UConn pep band. Unlike Greer, who remained seated during most games, Shabel often stood and walked along the sideline.\nShabel's first year at the helm was an uneven one, with an 6–8 record in non-conference play in the 1963–64 season. However, the Huskies went 8–2 in Yankee Conference regular season play, tying with Rhode Island atop the conference standings to claim the program's 14th Yankee Conference title. In a one-game playoff, UConn defeated Rhode Island 61–60 on the road to break the tie, clinching the program's ninth appearance in the NCAA tournament. In the first round, UConn avenged a regular season loss to Temple, beating the heavily favored Owls 53–48 in the Philadelphia. They faced even more difficult matchup with Princeton in the Sweet Sixteen. Before the game, Princeton coach Butch van Breda Kolff said he was so confident in his team's ability to win that he did not watch the Huskies' game against Temple. A tightly contested game throughout, UConn's Dom Perno stole the ball from future Hall of Famer Bill Bradley in the final seconds to seal a 52–50 win, sending the Huskies to the Elite Eight for the first time ever. The run ended there, however, as UConn lost to Shabel's former team, Duke, by a score of 101–55 in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nUnder Shabel, the Huskies won four Yankee Conference championships in four years, leading to three NCAA tournament berths. By the mid-1960s, UConn had appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times, second-most in the country. After the 1966–67 season, Shabel stepped down as head coach to become the athletic director at Penn. He later attributed the move to the school's ambivalence about committing greater financial resources to athletics, including the administration's decision to decline an invitation to the NIT in 1966 without consulting him.\nBurr Carlson era (1967–1969).\nAfter Shabel's departure, UConn offered the head coaching job to Larry Brown, then a young assistant coach at North Carolina. Brown declined, saying he felt he was too \"young\" to take a head coaching position.\nThe job ultimately went to Burr Carlson, a former player and an assistant under Shabel. Carlson led UConn to back-to-back losing seasons for the first time in over 30 years and was fired.\nDee Rowe era (1969–1977).\nUConn named Dee Rowe head coach ahead of the 1969–70 season. Under Rowe, the Huskies returned to form, winning the Yankee Conference title in his first year. Rowe posted six winning seasons in eight years, with two NCAA berths and two NIT appearances. In 1976, UConn won the ECAC New England regional championship to earn an NCAA berth and then beat Hofstra in the first round of the 1976 NCAA tournament to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth time ever.\nAt the end of the 1975–76 season, the Yankee Conference dropped basketball, which left UConn as an independent. Rowe coached the Huskies' first season as an independent before retiring from coaching at 48 years old, citing heath issues at the time. He later cited \"burn out\" as the reason for his decision.\nDom Perno era (1977–1986).\nFormer UConn star Dom Perno was tapped as Rowe's successor for the 1977–78 season. Perno oversaw UConn's transition from an independent program to a member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, where UConn was one of the seven founding schools. Under Perno, the Huskies had some early success, winning an ECAC New England regional championship in 1979 and earning one NCAA berth and three NIT appearances over his first five years. However, after four consecutive losing seasons, Perno resigned on April 14, 1986.\nJim Calhoun era (1986–2012).\nUConn hired Northeastern head coach Jim Calhoun to take over the program in the 1986–87 season. Before coming to Connecticut, Calhoun spent 14 seasons at Northeastern, leading the team to the NCAA tournament five times in his last six years with the school. In his final season, Calhoun's Northeastern team defeated UConn 90–73 in a game at the Hartford Civic Center. \n1986-87 season: Calhoun's first year.\nCalhoun inherited a team that included future NBA player Clifford Robinson. However, Robinson and fellow starter Phil Gamble were declared academically ineligible halfway through the year. Calhoun finished his first year with a record of 9–19, his only losing season as UConn's head coach.\n1987-88 season: NIT champions.\nHeading into the 1987–88 season, Robinson and Gamble regained their academic eligibility and the team showed significant improvement. The Huskies won a game in the Big East tournament for the first time since 1980 and gained a berth in the National Invitation Tournament. UConn went on a run in the tournament and defeated Ohio State 72–67 at Madison Square Garden to win the NIT, the school's first national basketball title.\n1989-90 season: The 'Dream Season'.\nThe 1990 \"Dream Season\" brought UConn basketball back to the national stage. Led by Chris Smith, Nadav Henefeld, Scott Burrell, Tate George, Rod Sellers and John Gwynn, UConn went from unranked in the preseason to winning the Big East regular season and tournament championships, both for the first time. 1990 also marked the opening of Gampel Pavilion, the program's new on-campus home. In the NCAA tournament the Huskies garnered a #1 seed in the East Region, but trailed Clemson 70–69 with 1 second remaining in the Sweet Sixteen. Burrell's full-court pass found Tate George on the far baseline. George spun, fired, and hit a buzzer-beater that is known in Connecticut simply as \"The Shot\". They would be eliminated on a buzzer-beater two days later by Duke, losing in overtime 79–78. UConn finished with a 31–6 overall record.\nDuring the 1994–95 season, the Huskies hosted Syracuse on ESPN. During an exciting stretch of the second half of that game, ESPN color commentator Dick Vitale claimed that Storrs, CT was the \"capital of the basketball world\" as both the men's and women's teams were having undefeated seasons so far. The Huskies beat Syracuse but later lost to Kansas to end their undefeated season.\nUConn continued to rise as a national program throughout the 1990s, winning five more Big East regular season and three more Big East tournament championships, as well as reaching several regional finals.\n1998–99 season: 'We Shocked The World', 1st NCAA title.\nUConn entered the season ranked #2 in the AP Top 25 poll, returning its entire starting five from the previous year's Elite Eight team. Calhoun convinced leading scorer Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton to return for his junior season instead of departing for the NBA, putting the Huskies in position to make a historic run. UConn started the season 19–0, with wins over five ranked teams. By early December, the Huskies were ranked #1 in the AP poll, where they stayed for a program-record 10 weeks. The team's first loss came to #16 Syracuse on February 1, 1999, a 59–42 defeat in front of a sold-out crowd at the Hartford Civic Center. Both Hamilton and starting center Jake Voskuhl were out with injuries. UConn quickly rebounded, however, beating #4 Stanford 70–59 on the road.

The team responded with 12 straight conference wins that propelled UConn to a #1 ranking in the AP poll by February. In mid-February, the team lost key starter Jerome Dyson to a season-ending knee injury in a 63–49 win against #23 Syracuse. UConn finished the regular season 4–2 without Dyson — with the two losses coming against Pittsburgh, ranked top-five in both matchups. The Huskies finished the year tied for second in the Big East and received the #3 seed in the conference tournament. In the Big East tournament quarterfinals, UConn lost to #6 seed Syracuse in a six-overtime game remembered as one of the greatest college basketball games of all-time. The Orange appeared to a hit a game-winning shot at the end of regulation, but the basket was waived off after review. Syracuse never led in the first five overtimes, but UConn was unable to put the game away. The Huskies went scoreless in the first two and a half minutes of the sixth overtime and fell to the Orange 127–117. Despite the loss, UConn was awarded a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the program's third Final Four with a 82–75 win over #3 seed Missouri.

The season featured wins at #17 Notre Dame and against #6 Syracuse at the XL Center, as well as a double-overtime loss to #7 Georgetown at Gampel Pavilion. UConn finished with a 20–10 overall record.\nConference realignment resulted in the breakup of the old Big East at the end of the 2012–13 season. Instead of leaving with the so-called Catholic 7 schools, UConn chose to remain a member of the original Big East's legal successor, later named the American Athletic Conference. Until leaving the American in 2020 to join the new Big East, UConn was the only charter member of the original Big East still playing in the conference.\n2013–14 season: 'Hungry Huskies', 4th NCAA title.\nThe Huskies came into Ollie's second season ranked #18 in the AP Top 25 poll. They started the year 9–0, which included a 59–58 win over Indiana in the 2K Sports Classic championship game and a 65–64 win over #15 Florida on a buzzer-beater from Shabazz Napier.

This is what happens when you ban us.\" Ollie's team was the first #7 seed to ever win the NCAA tournament. UConn finished with a 32–8 overall record. After the season, Napier and DeAndre Daniels were selected in the 2014 NBA draft as the #24 and #37 overall picks, respectively.\n2014–15 season: Another AAC final loss, no NCAA bid.\nDespite losing four of its top five scorers from the previous year, UConn entered the season ranked #17 in the AP Top 25 poll. The Huskies started the year 3–0, but fell out of the top 25 amid a three-game losing streak to West Virginia, #7 Texas and Yale — the last two of which were 1-point losses on last-second shots by the opponent. UConn finished the regular season tied for fifth in the American. In the AAC tournament quarterfinals, Ryan Boatright hit a game-winning 3-point shot against #3 seed Cincinnati as time expired. The team advanced to the conference championship game for the second straight year after a win over #2 seed Tulsa in the semifinals. However, UConn lost to #1 seed SMU 62–54 in the championship and missed the NCAA tournament as a result.

They would again re-enter the top 25 in January before falling out for the remainder of the year. UConn posted an 11–7 record in conference play, narrowly missing a three-way tie for third place at 12–6 in the American. Instead, the Huskies finished sixth, but received the #5 seed in the tournament because SMU was ineligible for postseason play. In one of the program's most memorable postseason games, UConn defeated #4 seed Cincinnati 104–97 in quadruple overtime the AAC tournament quarterfinals. Down by 3 with 0.6 seconds left on the clock in the third overtime, Jalen Adams hit a three-quarter court shot to force the fourth and final overtime.

UConn finished with a 14–18 overall record. Two days after the loss to SMU, Kevin Ollie was fired for just cause related to the NCAA investigation. On July 2, 2019, the NCAA announced UConn's wins for the 2017–18 season would be vacated because of the school's recruiting violations, giving the school an 0–18 official record for the year.\nDan Hurley era (2018–present).\nUConn hired Rhode Island head coach Dan Hurley as Ollie's replacement for the 2018–19 season. He was introduced on March 23, 2018. Prior to his six seasons at Rhode Island, Hurley spent nine years coaching at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in New Jersey and two years at Wagner College. His father is Bob Hurley Sr., a longtime New Jersey high school basketball coach and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, and his brother is Bobby Hurley, two-time national champion as a player at Duke and current head coach at Arizona State.\n2018–19 season: Hurley's first year.\nHurley's first season at UConn was an up-and-down affair. The first marquee win under Hurley came in his third game when the Huskies defeated #15 Syracuse 83–76 in the 2K Sports Classic semifinals at Madison Square Garden. However, UConn lost to Iowa the following day in the tournament championship game. The team's 6–12 record in the American Athletic Conference was its worst record in conference play in over three decades.

UConn started the year 9–3, including an upset win over #15 Florida at Gampel Pavilion. On January 18, 2020, after a 61–55 loss at #14 Villanova — a non-conference game that would become a conference game the next year — Hurley remarked that other teams \"better get us now. That's all, you better get us now. Because it's coming,\" foreshadowing the program's return to national relevance in the years ahead. In the penultimate game of the regular season, UConn defeated #21 Houston 77–71 at Gampel Pavilion on senior night and finished the year tied for fifth place in the American. UConn was set to face Tulane in the first round of the AAC tournament on March 12, 2020.

The program currently holds the record for the most Big East regular season titles (11) as well as the most Yankee Conference regular season titles (18).\nNew England Conference (5)\nYankee Conference (18)\nBig East Conference (11)\nConference tournament championships.\nFor much of the 20th century, UConn was a member of conferences that did not hold a postseason tournament (New England and Yankee). The advent of the ECAC men's basketball tournaments in the 1974–75 season provided UConn with its first opportunity to win a postseason conference championship. Over the past half century, UConn has won 11 conference tournament titles. The program is currently tied with Georgetown for the most Big East tournament championships (8) all time.\nECAC New England Tournament (2)\nBig East Conference Tournament (8)\nAmerican Athletic Conference Tournament (1)\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nIndicates NCAA championship\n† Indicates vacated by the NCAA\nNational Championships.\n1999 NCAA Title.\nThe Huskies were the top seed in the West region, and a win over Gonzaga in the regional final sent UConn to Tropicana Field for the program's first Final Four appearance. They defeated Ohio State 64–58 in the semi-final to face off against Duke in the final. Despite having been ranked #1 for half of the year, the Huskies entered the national championship game as 9-point underdogs.\nUConn won their first national title with a 77–74 victory.

Okafor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nOne day later the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season.\n2011 NCAA Title.\nThe 2011 Huskies won 11 straight games in postseason play, the final six of which resulted in the program's third national championship. On April 4, 2011, they defeated the Butler Bulldogs, 53–41. UConn junior Kemba Walker was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nMany consider UConn's win in the Championship Game to be a great defensive performance, as the Huskies held Butler to only 18.8% shooting from the field (a record for field goal percentage defense in a championship game) and tied a title game record with ten blocked shots. An analysis by Sports Illustrated columnist Luke Winn credited the Huskies' defense by demonstrating, for instance, that they blocked or altered a staggering 26.6% of Butler's shots – compared to just 3.8% by Pittsburgh and 12.1% by VCU in earlier rounds. The 53 points scored by Connecticut were, in turn, the lowest point total by a winning team in a championship game since 1949.\n2014 NCAA Title.\nIn 2014, led by American Athletic Conference Player of the Year Shabazz Napier, UConn became the first #7 seed to win the NCAA Championship, getting past No. 1 seed Florida, No. 2 seed Villanova, No. 3 seed Iowa State, and No. 4 seed Michigan State, before defeating the Kentucky Wildcats 60–54 in the championship game in Arlington, Texas. UConn is undefeated in the state of Texas in the Final Four (6–0).\nAs in 2004, the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season twice.\n2023 NCAA Title.\nIn 2023, the UConn Huskies won all of their tournament games by more than 10 points. Their path to the championship began against #13 seed Iona in the first round, in which they would trail at the half but eventually pull away in the end. The Huskies would then beat #5 Saint Mary's, #8 Arkansas, and #3 Gonzaga. The national semifinal would be a 13-point defeat of #5 Miami, their smallest margin of victory in the tournament.\nThe national championship would be a 17-point defeat of #5 San Diego State University as UConn won their fifth national title, tying Duke and Indiana for the fourth spot in national championships. \n2024 NCAA Title.\nIn 2024, the UConn Huskies became the first team to repeat as NCAA tournament champions since the Florida Gators in 2007. They won their sixth title, putting them at a tie with North Carolina for the third-most championships of all time. Once again, they won every tournament game by double digits; their smallest margin of victory in the entire tournament was 14 points against Alabama in the Final Four. The Huskies also set the record for the largest combined margin of victory in all their games with 140 points; and largest-average margin of victory of 23.3 points per game. Because of that, the 2024 Huskies are considered one of the most dominant teams in the history of March Madness, following up 2023's strong performance.\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 36 times. Their combined record is 69–31.

Former athletic director John Toner was inducted on February 28, 2009. On April 5, 2011, Kemba Walker was the first men's basketball player to be added to the program since the inaugural inductees, an honor he was bestowed after leading the team to a national championship.\nThe Huskies of Honor are each recognized by a four by five foot panel which displays his name, jersey number and years of service, and a plaque which summarizes each's career accomplishments; Both the panels and the plaques are on permanent display at Gampel Pavilion on the University of Connecticut campus in Storrs, Connecticut.\nRetired numbers.\nOn December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen would be permanently retired, effective with ceremonies to be held during the Huskies' final 2018–19 home game on March 3, 2019.

        "text": "The UConn Huskies women's basketball team is the college basketball program representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, in NCAA Division I women's basketball competition. They currently play in the Big East Conference.\nThe UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016, plus over 50 conference regular season and tournament championships. They have taken part in every NCAA tournament since 1989; as of the end of the 2018–19 season, this is the third-longest active streak in Division I. From 2008 to 2022, they appeared in a record 14 consecutive Final Fours.\nUConn owns the two longest winning streaks (men's or women's) in college basketball history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton University on November 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017, when a buzzer-beater at the end of overtime caused a 66–64 loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four to Mississippi State. The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008, in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010. The Huskies also own the longest winning streak in regular-season games in college history; after an overtime loss to Stanford on November 17, 2014, they won their next 126 regular-season games until a 68–57 loss to Baylor on January 3, 2019.\nUConn's current head coach is Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma, who joined the team in 1985. Auriemma is one of the most successful coaches in college basketball: his 1149–150 () record represents the highest winning percentage among NCAA basketball coaches (minimum 10 seasons), any level, men's or women's, while ranking him second in all-time women's wins behind current Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer.\nUConn has also been one of the leaders in women's basketball attendance; the team plays its home games at both the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs and the XL Center in Hartford.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1974–1991).\nThe Huskies' first game was played on December 5, 1974, and was a 40 to 27 win over visiting Eastern Connecticut State University. After winning their first two games, the team lost the other eight in a 10-game season. The team had a losing record during its first six seasons under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75) and Wanda Flora (1975–80), and only one winning season (in 1980–81) in five seasons under Jean Balthaser (1980–85). Before the 1985–86 season, UConn hired as their new head coach Geno Auriemma, who had served as assistant coach at Virginia, with the goal of revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate impact and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.\nAuriemma pulled off one of his biggest and most important early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and Tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance; the tournament ended in a first round loss. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.\nIn Auriemma's 6th season (1990–91) the program broke through on the national scene, again capturing the Big East regular season and Tournament titles, and earning a #3 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed up to then. UConn beat Toledo 81–80 at Gampel Pavilion in the opening round game, with Bascom scoring a team NCAA tournament single-game record 39 points, and moved on to the regionals at The Palestra in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Here the team upset heavily favored ACC power North Carolina State in the Sweet 16, and then defeated Clemson 60–57 to advance to their first-ever Final Four, also a first for any Big East school. UConn's season ended with a 61–55 loss to top-seeded Virginia in the national semifinals at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Bascom was hit with early foul trouble and Virginia held off a late UConn rally. Including these final tournament games, Bascom had set a new UConn scoring record with 2,177 points during her years at the school.\nRebecca Lobo era (1992–1995).\nUConn followed up its surprise run to the Final Four in 1991 by landing All-American Rebecca Lobo from Southwick, Massachusetts.\nUConn had modest success in Lobo's first 2 seasons, losing early in the NCAA Tournament in both seasons. In 1993–94, UConn had its most successful season to that point; led by Lobo and teammates Jamelle Elliott, Jennifer Rizzotti, Pam Webber, Kara Wolters and Carla Berube, UConn won 30 games for the first time in program history, winning the Big East tournament and regular-season titles. In the NCAA tournament UConn reached the Elite Eight but came up short in its hopes to make it back to the Final Four, losing to eventual champion North Carolina.\n1995 national championship: undefeated (35–0).\nWith every major player back from 1994, and the addition of Auriemma's most highly ranked recruit to date (Connecticut Player of the Year Nykesha Sales), UConn was in for a season to remember in 1994–95. The season started with an 80-point win over Morgan State; two weeks later, UConn defeated powerhouse North Carolina State by 23 points on the road. This season also saw the birth of one of the greatest rivalries in college sports, the UConn-Tennessee rivalry, that began when the two teams met for the first time on Martin Luther King Day at Gampel Pavilion. UConn defeated Tennessee 77–66 in front of a sold-out crowd in a game televised on ESPN and soon afterwards was ranked No. 1 in the polls for the first time in program history.\nUConn went unbeaten through the Conference regular season and Tournament and easily advanced into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest game of the year opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn blew out Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go, a lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.\nWith a perfect 35–0 record, UConn became only the fifth Division I women's basketball team to go undefeated en route to a national championship, and only the second in the NCAA era (since 1982). The Huskies also became the first unbeaten team in NCAA history (all divisions, men or women) to win 35 games in a season.\nThe 1994–95 UConn team was widely credited with increasing interest in women's basketball. The team was honored with a parade in Hartford, CT that drew over 100,000 spectators. The team won the Team of the Year Award at the ESPN ESPY awards that year, and Lobo became a popular symbol of the sport. UConn also signed a landmark deal during the season with Connecticut Public Television to broadcast their games.\nLobo graduated in 1995 receiving countless accolades: the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the Wade Trophy, the Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, the Honda-Broderick Cup, the Best Female Athlete ESPY Award (first basketball player ever), the Associated Press Athlete of the Year (second basketball player after Sheryl Swoopes), the NCAA Woman of the Year Award, the Academic All-America of the Year and also All-sports Academic All-America of the Year.\nIn 2010 Lobo became the first Connecticut player inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, among a class of six inductees, followed by teammate Jennifer Rizzotti in the class of 2013.\nA new powerhouse is born (1996–2000).\nAfter the 1995 Championship title, UConn rose to national prominence as one of the powerhouses in women's college basketball, giving coach Auriemma the chance to recruit star talents from high school like Shea Ralph in 1996 and Svetlana Abrosimova in 1997.\nEscalation of rivalry with Tennessee.\nStarting with their two meetings in 1995, the rivalry between the Tennessee Lady Vols and UConn escalated through the late 1990s and into the 2000s, becoming the marquee matchup in all women's sports, and taking on parallels to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry in Major League Baseball. Geno Auriemma jokingly once referred to Pat Summitt and Tennessee as the \"evil empire\", like Red Sox president and CEO Larry Lucchino said of the Yankees.\nIn the 1995–96 season UConn ended Tennessee's home court winning streak at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged itself in the Final Four that year in Charlotte, defeating UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought to be one of the more memorable tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth swings of momentum.\nUConn defeated Tennessee during the 1996–97 regular season; after a season-ending injury for Shea Ralph in the first round of the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Regional Final where the two teams met again, with Tennessee prevailing and ending Connecticut's unbeaten season by winning 91–81.\nTennessee defeated Connecticut again in the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted in the days after the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote. With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52.\nNykesha Sales controversy.\nAuriemma found himself in a national debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Perretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.\nMany people weighed in on the decision on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising the integrity of the game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and he would never had done it without Bascom's blessing.\nArrival of the TASSK Force.\nAuriemma signed his best recruiting class to date in 1998 when he signed five top-15 nationally ranked players. High school All-Americans Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, and Keirsten Walters were dubbed \"TASSK Force\" by Connecticut fans, using the players' initials. The class renewed hope of bringing more championships to Storrs after watching archrival Tennessee win three in a row.\nThe first season for the highly ranked class in 1998–99 was up and down and featured many injuries: Sue Bird tore her ACL and was lost for the season after only 10 games.\nIn the 1999 meeting at Gampel Pavilion, Tennessee prevailed again. During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head. UConn fans booed Randall the rest of the game and Tennessee fans later gave her the nickname \"Boo.\" The 1998–99 season ended in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament, where UConn lost 64–58 to Iowa State, falling short of reaching the Final Four for the third consecutive time.\n2000 national championship.\nMotivated by the previous disappointing season, UConn came back in 1999–2000 with the clear goal of reaching the championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters had to give up basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27–1 record, their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home—UConn had beaten Tennessee earlier in the season in Knoxville, and this was the first year the teams met twice. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and beat Penn State in the semifinals, reaching the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71–52 for their second national championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36–1 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's MVP.\nDiana Taurasi era (2001–2004).\nAuriemma pulled off another huge recruiting coup when he convinced All-American guard Diana Taurasi to travel across country to attend Connecticut. Taurasi hailed from Chino, California, and attended Don Lugo High School where she was the recipient of the 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the \"Los Angeles Times\" to the best player in southern California. She was also named the 2000 Naismith and \"Parade Magazine\" National High School Player of the Year. Taurasi finished her high school career ranked second to Cheryl Miller in state history with 3,047 points.\nWith Taurasi joining the core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma confidently predicted another championship in 2001, but the season turned out to be more difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first national championship.\n2002 national championship: undefeated (39–0).\nAs with the 2000 champions, who had also come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn returned hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.\nUConn advanced to the Final Four and outscored rival Tennessee in the semifinals by 23 points. In front of a record-breaking crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma for the championship 82–70 to complete a perfect 39–0 season. The starting five of Bird, Taurasi, Cash, Jones, and Williams is widely regarded as the best starting five in women's college basketball history. The championship game that year shattered ratings for ESPN and at the time was the highest rated college basketball game to air on the network, men's or women's.\n2003 national championship.\nWith the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had to carry most of the load in her junior season, with help from returning teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class of Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 was supposed to be a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.\nIn the NCAA Tournament UConn easily advanced to the Final Four at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. UConn rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat Texas in the semifinals and, aided by Taurasi's 28 points in the finals, defeated rival Tennessee for UConn's fourth national championship. UConn became the first team to win a championship without a senior on their roster.\n2004 national championship.\nAlthough the entire team returned and expectations were sky high for a \"three-peat\" in Taurasi's senior year, UConn had an uneven season. The team gave up large leads against Duke and suffered losses to Notre Dame and Villanova, also losing to Boston College in the semifinals of the Big East tournament.\nThe Huskies found their rhythm during the NCAA Tournament, in which they were a #2 seed; in the Elite Eight they beat top-seeded Penn State to advance to the Final Four at the New Orleans Arena. After beating Minnesota in the semifinals, UConn again defeated Tennessee for the national championship. The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014.\nIn her career at UConn, Taurasi led the team to four consecutive Final Fours and three straight national titles. Prior to that final championship, her coach, Geno Auriemma, predicted his team's likelihood of winning with the statement, \"We have Diana, and you don't.\"\nTaurasi received many personal accolades at UConn including the 2003 and 2004 Naismith College Player of the Year awards, the 2003 Wade Trophy, the 2003 Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the 2003 USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and the 2004 Best Female Athlete ESPY Award. Taurasi was the third basketball player to receive this final honor, after former UConn star Rebecca Lobo and Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw. She achieved legendary status among UConn fans, and is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time.\nRebuilding years (2005–2007).\nRelative to their high standards, UConn struggled during the first two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that had become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).\nThe 2004–05 season was marked with sloppy play and ragged offense; UConn lost 8 games and failed to win the Big East regular season crown for the first time since 1993. In the NCAA tournament, UConn lost to Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the 2005–06 season, UConn showed some signs of improvement, winning the Big East tournament and beating Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen thanks to a fadeaway 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left by senior Barbara Turner. Behind a home state crowd, UConn almost upset #1 ranked Duke in the regional final, before falling in overtime by 2 points.\nIn the 2006–07 season, the team improved with the additions of Renee Montgomery, Mel Thomas, Ketia Swanier, and the #1 ranked high school player Tina Charles, helping UConn emerge as a contender again. UConn was a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but eventually lost to LSU in the regional final to end the season with a 32–4 record.\nMaya Moore era (2008–2011).\nAfter three down years by UConn standards, the team emerged as a heavy contender for the championship in the 2008 season. In addition to all players returning from the 2007 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the team after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending one of the biggest rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.\nDespite losing Mel Thomas and Kalana Greene to season-ending knee injuries, UConn went through the 2007–08 regular season with only a single loss at Rutgers, by two points, winning both the Big East regular season and tournament titles. Rallying from a 14-point deficit in the NCAA regional final they beat conference rival Rutgers and advanced to their first Final Four since Taurasi graduated. Those tournament victories were largely credited to senior Charde Houston, a top recruit out of San Diego viewed as not living up to expectations from Geno Auriemma and the UConn fans up to that point, who came up with key rebounds and clutch points in those games. In the National semifinals played at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa UConn lost to Stanford, ending its season with a 36–2 record. This would be the team's last loss for quite some time.\n2009 national championship: undefeated (39–0).\nFor the third consecutive year UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena Delle Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn Delle Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball in order to stay closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; Delle Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 pick at 2013 WNBA draft. Despite losing Delle Donne the Huskies were ranked No. 1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from the 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene who recovered from her knee injury.\nUConn finished the regular season undefeated for the 5th time in school history with a 30–0 record. They won their 17th Big East Regular Season title and their 15th Big East tournament title beating the Louisville Cardinals. The Huskies advanced to their 10th Final Four with an 83–64 victory over Arizona State, and then to the 6th NCAA Championship Game in program history by defeating Stanford, also by the score of 83–64. In the Championship Game UConn defeated Louisville 76–54 behind Charles' 25 points and 19 boards, ending the season with a perfect 39–0 record (with every victory by at least 10 points, a record of its own) and sixth national title.\n2010 national championship: undefeated (39–0).\nFor the second consecutive year (and the sixth time in school history) UConn finished the regular season undefeated, with an average margin of victory of 35.9 points. During the regular season UConn played 11 games against ranked opponents (including 6 in the top ten) with an average margin of victory of 24. They dominated the Big East tournament, winning the championship game 60–32. Throughout the regular season and the Big East tournament, UConn's closest win was against Stanford, by 12 points.\nLeading up to the Final Four in San Antonio, UConn dominated teams from Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played little more than half the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring its opponents by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by Baylor and the 6-foot-8 freshman Brittney Griner; Baylor trailed 39–26 at halftime, cut the deficit to 41–38 with 15 minutes remaining in the game, but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70–50.\nThe national championship game against Stanford was a completely different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only 11 teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: three of them were against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47. It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards, was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.\nA new record, but no three-peat.\nThe 2010–11 season began with high hopes but much uncertainty for the Huskies. Maya Moore returned for her senior season after a summer with the U.S. National team, but UConn lost major contributors Tina Charles and Kalana Greene who graduated in 2010. Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury. In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team. After a break in the schedule for the holidays, UConn traveled out west and beat the Pacific Tigers to stretch the streak to 90 games. That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinal. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008 Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinal). The loss ended the highly publicized winning streak, as well as their long held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East tournament Championship Game.\nIn the NCAA tournament Final Four UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points. Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A&amp;M Aggies.\nDuring 2010–11 season Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd Naismith College Player of the Year award, her 3rd straight Wade Trophy (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, her 2nd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and her 2nd John R. Wooden Award; she was also voted Big East Player of The Year (3rd time) and a fourth straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls (second player ever after Oklahoma's Courtney Paris).\nIn her amazing college career Maya Moore won 150 games and only lost 4, amassing a total 3036 points (1st Husky ever and 4th all-time in NCAA division I women's basketball), 1276 rebounds (2nd Husky ever), 310 steals (3rd Husky ever), 544 assists (6th Husky ever) and 204 blocks (4th Husky ever); she is the only women's basketball player in Division I history to record 2500 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, 250 steals and 150 blocked shots. On February 28 she was enshrined in the Huskies of Honor (3rd time ever for an active player).\nMaya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the Elite 88 Award, and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, Cosida Academic All-America of the Year in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and All-sports Academic All-America of the Year in 2011.\nAfter graduation Maya Moore was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.\nThe calm before the storm (2012).\nThe 2011–12 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.\nEven if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.\nBreanna Stewart era (2013–2016).\n2013 national championship.\nThe 2012–13 season began with high hopes having UConn landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall Breanna Stewart from Cicero – North Syracuse High School, forward Morgan Tuck and guard Moriah Jefferson. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where UConn went 27–3 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament UConn lost a third straight time to Notre Dame that delivered a last-minute comeback. In the NCAA tournament UConn key-players Stewart, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Stefanie Dolson and senior Kelly Faris raised their level of play, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four; in the semifinals they handily beat Notre Dame and in the finals they obtained a 93–60 win over Louisville, who had earlier upset Baylor, for a record tying eighth national championship.\nThe end of 2012–13 season saw the breakup of the Big East Conference. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Notre Dame defected to the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Louisville announcing later they would follow in 2014. Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"Catholic 7\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them. The remaining teams of the former Big East (Connecticut and Cincinnati) joined the new American Athletic Conference (The American or AAC), thus ending the UConn–Notre Dame rivalry in conference tournaments.\n2014 national championship: undefeated (40–0).\nWith Faris and Doty graduated, sophomore Breanna Stewart was the undisputed leader of the 2013–14 UConn team, starting in all 40 games and leading the team with 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game; her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals.\nThe team beat every opponent by at least 10 points and easily reached the NCAA tournament finals, where they met unbeaten Notre Dame, making it the first matchup of two undefeated teams in the championship game. UConn defeated 79–58 Notre Dame (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, Natalie Achonwa, who had torn her ACL in the Elite Eight), to finish the season 40–0, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting the new record for Championship with nine. Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor.\n2015 national championship.\nThe 2014–15 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the second game of the season, ending a 47-games winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson and senior Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn quickly recovered winning every other season game, including a 76–58 win against rival Notre Dame. In the National Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four held in Tampa, Florida. Connecticut defeated Maryland 81–58, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66–65, in the semifinals.\nThe teams met again on April 7, 2015, in the national championship game. UConn won by a score of 63–53 to achieve their third straight national championship and tenth total, with coach Auriemma tying a record set by John Wooden in college basketball.\n2016 national championship: undefeated (38–0).\nIn 2015 UConn landed another top recruit in #1 High School prospect Katie Lou Samuelson; she quickly earned a spot in the starting five alongside sophomore Kia Nurse and seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. The team was unstoppable all season long, beating every opponent by an average of 39.7 points, and easily winning conference regular season and tournament.\nWhile other #1 seeds Notre Dame, South Carolina and Baylor suffered early upsets in the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four where they defeated Oregon State 80–51 and then old Big East rival Syracuse 82–51 in the Championship Game. UConn completed their sixth undefeated season winning the 11th overall Championship (all-time record for both men's and women's college basketball) and 4th in a row (also a record for women's college basketball). Geno Auriemma is now the only coach in college basketball to have won 11 titles, passing UCLA legend John Wooden (who has 10) and reaching former NBA coach Phil Jackson.\nSenior Breanna Stewart was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player for a record 4th straight time; she also performed a back-to-back sweep of all individual honors, winning her 2nd straight Wade Trophy, a record 3rd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, a record 3rd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, a record 3rd Naismith College Player of the Year award and her 2nd straight John R. Wooden Award. Stewart finished with 2,676 points (2nd Husky ever), 1,179 rebounds (4th Husky ever), 426 assists and 414 blocked shots (1st Husky ever), and was a #1 pick in 2016 WNBA draft. Moriah Jefferson finished with a program-record 659 assists and a back-to-back Nancy Lieberman Award as best point guard in the nation. The trio of Stewart-Jefferson-Tuck ended its college career with a 151–5 record, the most victories for college basketball players; they are the only 4-time winners in college basketball history (freshmen were not eligible to play during UCLA men's streak). With their eleventh championship win in 2016, the UConn Huskies have tied the UCLA Bruins men's team for most college basketball championships, and became the first Division I women's basketball team to win four straight national championships.\nCurrent years (2017–).\nA new record streak ends.\nAfter losing the stellar trio of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, many predicted a sub-par season for UConn standards; the AP Poll ranked the team third in the nation, and coach Auriemma had designed a very tough non-conference calendar to test the strength of his young team. The first regular season game, a 2-point win against #12 Florida State, seemed to confirm the expectations, with coach Auriemma predicting \"a good beat\" ahead.\nAs the season progressed, however, the team quickly found its rhythm, beating ranked teams like Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and showcasing a talented core of young players. Together with sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, who had played few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.\nComing from a 75-wins streak from previous season, UConn tied its own previous 90-wins record with a 102–37 win against South Florida on October 1, 2017; the 100th straight wins mark was reached on February 13, 2017, with a 66–55 win against South Carolina.\nAfter easy wins in both conference regular season and conference tournament, UConn entered the NCAA tournament unbeaten, #1 overall and once again a heavy favorite to win it all; the season came to an unexpected end when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater to give its team a 66–64 overtime victory in the NCAA Final Four. The loss ended the streak at 111 consecutive wins, an all-time record not only for college basketball games, but also for any team sport played at college level.\nAuriemma's 1000th win.\nThe 2017–2018 season was very similar to the previous one. Connecticut returned every key player and added Duke's transfer Azurá Stevens and nation top ranked recruit Megan Walker; the team easily reached the Final Four with a 36–0 record that included solid wins over Stanford, Notre Dame, Louisville and South Carolina. The stage appeared set for a rematch with Mississippi State in the championship game, but historic rival Notre Dame beat UConn in the semifinal with another overtime last second shot by Arike Ogunbowale. Ogunbowale would hit a similar shot 2 days later as Notre Dame defeated Mississippi State 61–58 to win the national title.\nOn December 19 a win over Oklahoma gave coach Geno Auriemma his 1000th victory in just 1135 games, making him only the fourth women's coach to reach that plateau — preceded by Pat Summitt, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell — and the fastest one.\n2021-2022 First National Title Game in Six Years.\nIn 2022 NCAA tournament, in the Bridgeport Region UConn beat the 15th seed Mercer, 7th seed UCF, 3rd seed Indiana and the 1st seed, Nc State to reach the final four for the 14th consecutive year. They then beat long-time rival and defending national champions Stanford to reach the National Championship game for the first time since 2016. They lost to the number one overall seed South Carolina 64–49.\n2023-present.\nAfter winning the Big East Tournament in 2023, UConn was ranked as a No. 2 seed in the Seattle regional of the 2023 NCAA tournament. The Huskies advanced to the Sweet 16, where they lost to No. 3-seeded Ohio State, 73–61.\nOn February 7, 2024, Geno Auriemma became just the third college basketball coach to reach 1,200 wins when the Huskies defeated Seton Hall.\nSeason-by-season results.\n \nConference tournament.\nUConn played in the Big East Conference from the 1982–83 season, the first in which the league sponsored women's basketball and held a tournament, until the conference split in 2013. The Huskies won 18 tournaments in 31 years. From 2013–14 to 2019–20, UConn played in the American Athletic Conference, where they went unbeaten both in regular season and conference tournament games, with a perfect 139–0 record and 7 conference tournaments. In 2020–21, UConn rejoined several of its former conference mates in the current Big East Conference.\nPostseason.\nThe Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times, every year since their first appearance in 1989. Their combined record is 128–24 ; they have been to 23 Final Fours and are 11-time National Champions (1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016).\nHead coaches.\nSandra Hamm (1974–1975).\nSandra Hamm, a Terryville native, was employed part-time as the interim women's coach in the 1974–1975 season, when the team was 2–8. When she wasn't coaching, she taught physical education at a junior high school in Manchester.\nWanda Flora (1975–1980).\nAfter graduating from college in California, Wanda Flora went to graduate school at Indiana University, where she was an assistant coach for the women's basketball team and coached the junior varsity team. After a brief stint at a small college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that number had increased to 12 by 1980.\nJean Balthaser (1980–1985).\nIn 1980 the university hired Jean Balthaser, who had coached at the University of Pittsburgh. Ms. Balthaser continued to expand the program, leading UConn to its first winning season in her first year as coach, and finishing with a 52–88 record over five seasons.\nGeno Auriemma (1985–present).\nIn his 38 years as head coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, the Italian-born Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma has inextricably linked his name with that of the team. Inheriting a program that had only had one winning season in its entire history, Auriemma has overseen one of the most successful rebuilding projects in college sports history. Under his watch, UConn has become the winningest team in women's college basketball, and he has made a strong case as one of the best coaches ever. In his astonishing career Auriemma has won more than 25 different national Coach of the Year awards and was inducted into both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. He was head coach of the United States women's national basketball team from 2009 until stepping down from that role after the 2016 Summer Olympics. During his tenure with Team USA, they won the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, plus Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016.\nNotable players.\nIndividual achievements.\nUConn has featured a great number of star players, All-Americans, Hall of Famers and recipients of individual trophies. The following table shows the UConn players recipients of the major individual awards in women's college basketball.\nAfter the end of the NCAA tournament, the Associated Press selects a Most Outstanding Player.\nSeven UConn players received this award since its induction in 1982: Rebecca Lobo (1995), Sue Bird (2002), Swin Cash (2002), Diana Taurasi (2003 and 2004), Tina Charles (2009), Maya Moore (2010), and Breanna Stewart who won 3 times (2014, 2015, 2016).\nSchool records.\nStatistics correct through April 5, 2024.\nPlayers active in 2023–24 are in bold.\nMost points (1000-point club)\nMost rebounds (top-15)\nMost assists (top-15)\nMost steals (top-15)\nMost blocks (top-15)\nMost 3-Point Field Goals Made (top-15)\nHuskies of Honor.\nThe Huskies of Honor is a program recognizing the most significant figures in UConn history, with plaques in Gampel Pavilion commemorating the inductees.\nThe women's basketball players list includes guards Sue Bird, Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Renee Montgomery, Shea Ralph, Jennifer Rizzotti, Nykesha Sales, and Diana Taurasi; forwards Svetlana Abrosimova, Swin Cash, Napheesa Collier, Maya Moore, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Katie Lou Samuelson, Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck, and Gabby Williams; centers Kerry Bascom, Tina Charles, Stefanie Dolson, Rebecca Lobo, and Kara Wolters.\nRetired numbers.\nOn December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #50 worn by Rebecca Lobo would be permanently retired, effective with ceremonies to be held during the Huskies' final 2018–19 home game on March 2, 2019. In its announcement, UConn stated that going forward, number retirement would be reserved for former Huskies players inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as Lobo was in 2017. At the same time, the Huskies announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen, a 2018 Naismith Hall inductee, would be retired by UConn men's basketball, with ceremonies held during the season's final men's home game on March 3, 2019. UConn's announcement did not make it clear whether both numbers would be retired across both men's and women's programs, but a university spokesperson clarified that the retirements applied only to the teams that Lobo and Allen competed for, meaning that #50 remains available in men's basketball and #34 in women's. Additionally, on November 14, 2022, UConn retired the #32 worn by Swin Cash, as she was a 2022 Naismith Hall inductee, with ceremonies held during the women's team game against Texas.\nWNBA success.\nTwenty UConn players have been selected in the first round of WNBA drafts. Five of them have been first overall picks: Sue Bird (2002), Diana Taurasi (2004), Tina Charles (2010), Maya Moore (2011), and Breanna Stewart (2016). Rebecca Lobo was part of the 1997 inaugural draft, with the top players allocated to founding teams without any particular order; similarly Nykesha Sales was part of the 1998 WNBA expansion players allocation.\nIn the 2002 WNBA draft, the four UConn players tabbed \"TASS Force\" (Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones, Sue Bird, Swin Cash) were all first round selections, each having immediate impact with their WNBA team.\nIn the 2016 WNBA draft UConn performed even better, with the three seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck sweeping the first three picks for the first time in the history of any major sport.\nTrophies and awards.\nTeam of the Decade 2000–2009\nIn 2010 \"Sports Illustrated\" selected the top 25 sports franchises of the decade 2000–2009. The sports under consideration were the four major professional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) along with the three most prominent college sports: football, men's basketball and women's basketball. The Connecticut Huskies were the #3 selection on the list, behind only the professional basketball Lakers and the professional football Patriots, making the Connecticut women's basketball team the highest ranked of the collegiate teams for the three sports under consideration. During this period, UConn won five national titles, while making the Final Four seven of the ten years. Two of the seasons (2001–02 and 2008–09) resulted in perfect 39–0 records.\nRecords and achievements.\nStreaks.\n\"Active streaks in bold\""

The single topping the charts for three weeks in June 1984, and was the second highest selling single in Australia in 1984 behind \"Dancing in the Dark\" by Bruce Springsteen. The piece is centered around fictitious commentary of a match between Australia and Pakistan.\nThe track has never seen a full-length re-issue since the 2000 release of Wired World of Sports.\nBackground and release.\nAt the time of \"It’s Just Not Cricket's\" release, Birmingham was running his own music marketing consultancy and helping manage fellow comedian Austen Tayshus. In a 2014 interview with Sydney Morning Herald, Birmingham explains \"The year before I’d written \"Australiana\" [also a No. 1 hit] for Austen Tayshus and I wanted to see if I could do something for myself. One day I went out in my backyard with a pencil and paper and wrote what would basically become the six or seven minutes of \"It’s Just Not Cricket\". Some mates came around that night and asked what I'd been doing all day. I played them the dictaphone recording and they got a good laugh out of it\". adding \"I’d actually worked for EMI Music back in 1975 and I had them as a client of my own business, so it was an obvious choice as to where I’d take this thing\".\nA track heavily based on \"It's Just Not Cricket\" involving a match between England and Sri Lanka was featured on the 1999 UK compilation \"It's Just Not Cricket (Volumes 1 and 2)\"."

Listed at tall and , Oliver batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Montgomery, Alabama.\nOliver was a slap hitter who rarely tried to drive the ball. As an outfielder, his arm and speed were already well above average, while his graceful style prompted baseball historian Fred Lieb to compare him to Joe DiMaggio and Tris Speaker.\nIn his rookie season for Boston, Oliver led the American League in games played (154), outs (472) and at-bats (646), while hitting a career-high .293 and leading his team in runs (86), hits (186) and singles (153). He enjoyed another good season in 1931, when he hit .276 and posted career-numbers in doubles (35) and RBI (75). He also led his team in singles (122), triples (5) and outs (436), and was considered in the American League MVP vote. The next two years he shared duties at center field with Dusty Cooke and Carl Reynolds.\nIn a four-season career, Oliver was a .277 hitter with 202 runs and 176 RBI in 514 games, including 191 doubles, 11 triples, 12 stolen bases, and a .316 on-base percentage without home runs. In 504 games at center field, he collected 1,425 outs with 45 assists and made 14 double plays, while committing 21 errors in 1,491 chances for a .986 fielding percentage.\nOliver holds the modern major league baseball record by going 1,931 at-bats without a home run in his career.\nOliver coached for the Philadelphia Athletics and Baltimore Orioles from 1951 to 1954.

Born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, he played for Bath, Northampton and the Ospreys. His career was greatly interrupted by injuries, and he won just one cap for Wales, on the tour to Japan in 2001.\nProfessional career.\nLloyd came through the Bath academy, first appearing in a friendly against Keynsham in 1999, before making his competitive debut against Leicester Tigers in May 2000. That summer, Lloyd was selected for a Wales Developmental tour to Canada, the youngest player selected.\nLloyd made nine appearances the following season, and was selected in 2001 for the Wales U21 team. That summer, Lloyd was selected for the 2001 Wales rugby union tour of Japan. Lloyd made his first appearance for Wales in the 45–41 defeat against Suntory. Lloyd was selected at blindside flanker for the first test against Japan, making his international debut on 10 June 2001, and scoring a try in the match as Wales won 64–10. Lloyd made one more appearance during the tour, off the bench against the Pacific Barbarians.\nFollowing the Wales tour, Lloyd returned to Bath, but suffered a serious back injury in November 2001. His injury ultimately kept him out for the majority of the following two seasons. In November 2003, Lloyd signed for the Ospreys, with the aim of pushing for further Wales caps.

One of Roberts' teammates at the Ospreys was fly-half James Hook, with whom he formed an effective half back partnership, after the pair had done the same at both Neath College and Neath RFC.\nAfter three years with the Ospreys, Roberts signed for their regional rivals, the Scarlets, on 27 March 2008, following the departure of former Scarlets scrum-half Dwayne Peel to Sale Sharks. He signed a two-year contract with the Llanelli region, where he would compete with Sililo Martens, Lee Williams and Gavin Cattle for the number 9 jersey.\nRoberts has represented Wales internationally at every level from schools through to full international. In 2007, Roberts was selected for the Wales Sevens team.\nRoberts was selected for the Wales senior squad for the Autumn international series in October 2008. After Premier Rugby refused to release Peel and Gloucester scrum-half Gareth Cooper for Wales' final Autumn test against Australia, coach Warren Gatland gave Roberts his international debut with a start against Canada on 14 November in an effort to give him a level of international experience ahead of the Australia game.\nRoberts made two more appearances for Wales in the 2009 Autumn tests, first coming on for Cooper after 54 minutes of the New Zealand game on 7 November, before replacing Peel for the final eight minutes of the Australia match three weeks later.

        "title": "South African cricket team in England in 2008",
        "text": "The South African cricket team toured England between 29 June and 4 September 2008. They played four Test matches, one Twenty20 International and five One Day Internationals against England. They also played six tour matches against Somerset, Middlesex, Bangladesh A, a PCA Masters XI and two against the England Lions.\nIt was announced that following the conclusion of this four-match series, future matches between England and South Africa would comprise five Test matches but only three one-day matches after the series was granted 'icon' status. The first game with the new format would be in the 2009–10 season in South Africa. In fact though, the next series was four matches, and the 2012 series three.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nThe series between South Africa and England was a highly anticipated one. England had recently played for the best part of six months against the same opposition (New Zealand) winning the two test series 4–1 on aggregate. They were aware that South Africa would prove to be far superior opposition in the test arena. South Africa arrived in England off the back of a successful winter which had seen them win series in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and draw one in India. They had also beaten New Zealand and West Indies on their home soil comfortably.\nEngland named an unchanged XI for the sixth test in a row, a record. Graeme Smith won the toss and chose to field first hoping his much publicised pace attack would make early inroads into the struggling England batting lineup, which had not passed 400 in their first innings for over a year. However, the South African bowlers were wayward on the first day of the match, and apart from a post-lunch burst where they captured three quick wickets, were unable to exert much authority.\nKevin Pietersen scored a century, a notable moment as it was the first time he had faced his country of birth in a Test match. On day 2, he would go on to score 152, and Ian Bell, who the South Africans has specifically targeted as a player under pressure, scored 199 before being dismissed by the only spinner in the South African squad, Paul Harris.\nIn amongst this, the openers had scored well for England and Stuart Broad, batting at no 8, scored a free flowing 76 as the South African bowling attack wilted. England eventually declared late on day two on 593/8, straight after Bell was out for 199. The day's play came to an end very early in South Africa's reply due to poor light.\nOn day 3, England's bowlers carried on from where the batsmen left off. Graeme Smith was caught off a rising Anderson delivery early in the day to get things going, and all the bowlers contributed from there. Neil McKenzie produced a gritty 40 before being bowled round his legs by Monty Panesar. AB de Villiers scored freely before being very well caught by James Anderson off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Ashwell Prince compiled a determined century to give the South African innings some resemblance of respectability.\nHowever, South Africa were bowled out for just 247, and Michael Vaughan quickly enforced the follow on late on day 3. The openers had to survive a tricky session which saw England open their attack with Monty Panesar and Kevin Pietersen due to the poor light conditions. In fact, Smith was almost dismissed by Pietersen twice during this spell, something he would have been very relieved to avoid, not just due to the match situation, but also as a result of the rivalry between the two players.\nDay 4 saw a much more determined approach from the South Africans, aided by a very flat wicket offering little to the bowlers. Smith and McKenzie batted slowly and cautiously, particularly during the morning where the scoring rate was around 1 run per over. Slowly, but surely, they built a partnership and started to chip away at England's lead, whilst frustrating the bowlers in the process. Both men would record a century, and the only wicket to fall in the day was Smith who top edged a pull shot from the new ball off James Anderson's bowling shortly after reaching his 100.\nSouth Africa's resistance continued into the final day, where Hashim Amla also compiled a century to keep England at bay. McKenzie was eventually dismissed after 9.5 hours at the crease, and the only real highlight for England was the cheap dismissal of Jacques Kallis to an excellent yorker from Ryan Sidebottom. The match was declared a draw shortly after tea, with South Africa's second innings score on 393/3. South Africa did declare this innings to call a halt to proceedings, with Michael Vaughan agreeing his side would not go out to chase the 47 run difference.\nEssentially it was a match of two halves. England dominance for three days, exploiting helpful conditions and a poor South African bowling effort. South Africa responded excellently on the final two days, to ensure they only lost three wickets during two days of play. It was felt at the time that South Africa would have gained the most out of the drawn fixture.\n2nd Test.\nThe second test of the series was played at Headingley. England omitted the struggling Paul Collingwood from the side, and replaced him with Andrew Flintoff, returning to play his first test since the final Ashes test at the SCG at the start of 2007. Ryan Sidebottom, suffering from injury, was replaced with debutant Darren Pattinson. This decision provoked considerable reaction as many felt there were other bowlers who were better placed to come into the side – Chris Tremlett, Matthew Hoggard and Stephen Harmison all sprung to mind. Pattinson, born in Grimsby and raised in Australia, had only bowled a handful of overs at first class level, and whilst he had shown promise, his elevation to the test arena was arguably too much too soon for him. A year previously, he was playing grade cricket in Australia alongside his regular job as a roof tiler. He had even shown uncertainly when asked about how keen he was to actually play for England. The decision to field him during a critical Test match prompted a variety of reaction and viewpoints from commentators, players and press experts.\nSouth Africa named an unchanged side, boosted by the confidence of the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was the best of a bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.\nSouth Africa used day 2 to ensure England had no chance in the match. Although Hashim Amla was dismissed by Pattinson for his maiden test wicket during the morning session, Ashwell Prince and AB de Villiers formed a strong partnership which would frustrate England for the rest of the day. Their batting was cautious, but not defensive, and they both gradually ground out large scores knowing that they were taking the match out of England's reach. By the end of day 2, South Africa's score was 322/4, a lead of 119.\nAshwell Prince registered his century on day 2, and would go on to score 149. AB de Villiers passed the 3 figure mark on day 3, and went on to make a magnificent 174, and it required a brilliant catch by Andrew Flintoff at slip to eventually dismiss him. England's bowling attack looked innocuous, and lacking any firepower at all. Even Andrew Flintoff struggled to make a significant impact, as South Africa were eventually dismissed for 522 – a massive lead of 319.\nEngland's second innings batting effort was an improvement on the first, but still left people with more questions than answers. Andrew Strauss was out for 0, Michael Vaughan looked brilliant for 21 runs but then edged Makhaya Ntini through to Mark Boucher. Alastair Cook scored a decent score of 60, but not enough to get England out of trouble. Kevin Pietersen came in for the most criticism, scoring 13 runs off 4 balls before edging through to the keeper off the bowling of Jacques Kallis.\nIn contrast, the non specialist batsmen showed the sort of application that was required in the situation. James Anderson, batting as nightwatchman, kept Alastair Cook company for almost the entire morning session of day 4, compiling his highest score of 34. He faced some extremely hostile bowling during this, and was hit on the helmet by Dale Steyn. Later on, Andrew Flintoff and Tim Ambrose formed a partnership that looked promising, but both fell in the 30s. Stuart Broad, batting at no 8 and with just the tail to support him, made another highly impressive innings of 67 (not out) which included some magnificent cover drives and pull shots. Broad had arguably contributed more with the bat than the ball in the series so far, and even prompted Geoffrey Boycott to compare some of his strokeplay with that of Sir Garfield Sobers.\nHowever, the overall picture was that England succeeded in making South Africa bat again, but with a target of just 9 runs. South Africa therefore won the test by 10 wickets and took a 1–0 lead in the series."

During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing .\nRobinson spent four seasons as a bullpen coach and pitching coach in the Major leagues for the White Sox and Houston Astros. He currently serves in a coaching capacity for the Pittsburgh Pirates Minor League Baseball (MiLB) organization.\nPlaying career.\nA native of Evanston, Illinois, Robinson attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale. In 1975, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Robinson was selected by the White Sox in the 19th round (467th overall) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. After a sparkling season as a relief pitcher for the Class A Appleton Foxes — 50 games pitched, a 10–3 win–loss record, with 17 saves, 121 strikeouts and a 1.72 earned run average (ERA), in 89 innings pitched — he made the 1979 ChiSox' opening day roster. But he was ineffective in two trials and 11 games with Chicago that season, losing his only decision and posting an ERA of 6.28. In between those stints, however, Robinson had a good season for the Triple-A Iowa Oaks, winning 13 games in relief.\nFollowing Robinson's success at Iowa with a strong months to begin , he was recalled to the ChiSox in July and pitched well in middle relief. In 15 games through the end of September, Robinson split two decisions and allowed only 26 hits in 35 innings pitched, with an ERA of 3.09. But in , he appeared in only 29 professional games, including four with the White Sox, to conclude his MLB career. However, Robinson's last appearance in the big leagues — on October 4 — was a memorable one. Entering the game in the ninth inning at Comiskey Park with the White Sox trailing the Minnesota Twins 12–9, Robinson pitched a scoreless inning. Then, when the White Sox rallied for four runs and a walk-off, 13–12 victory, Robinson was credited with the win.\nAll told, in 30 MLB games and innings pitched, Robinson split four decisions, giving up 42 hits and 28 bases on balls, with 35 strikeouts, and a career ERA of 4.05.

        "text": "USA Bobsled/Skeleton (USABS) is the official national governing body (NGB) for Bobsled and Skeleton in the United States. It serves as the American representative for the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation and is chartered by the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee.\nUSABS is headquartered in Lake Placid, NY. The organization formerly used the name \"United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation\" or USBSF.\nRacing Circuits and Operations.\nThe bobsled and skeleton teams compete on the two levels within the IBSF, a development level and a world cup level. The Development Team competes on the North American Cup and European Cup while the National Team generally competes on the World Cup. In an Olympic year, the teams that compete on the World Cup will usually carry directly into the Winter Olympic Games. \nNorth American Cup.\nThe North American Cup (NAC) consists of tracks in North America. These tracks are located in Lake Placid NY, Park City UT, and Whistler BC. There was formerly a track located in Calgary AB, but it has been closed since the 2019 season.\nEuropean Cup.\nThe European Cup (EC) is another development level circuit that races only on tracks in Europe.\nWorld Cup.\nThe World Cup (WC) races on tracks in any location around the world (North America, Europe, and Asia). Bobsled teams and Skeleton athletes gain points through placement in races throughout the season and race in the World Championships (generally held in February) each year. The location for World Championships and World Cup races change from year to year. Tracks from the NAC and EC are used for the World Cup.\nBasics of Bobsled and Skeleton.\nIn modern day bobsled, men compete in two disciplines, 4-man and 2-man. Women also compete in two disciples, those being 2-man and mono-bob. Skeleton athletes always compete solo, unlike Luge, which does have a doubles event. Bobsled and Skeleton are managed under the IBSF and are a separate entity from luge, although the three together are considered to be under the umbrella of \"sliding sports.\" All three sports utilize the same tracks, with luge having different start gates at the top of each track. This is because in luge, the athlete pulls themselves to start while in bobsled and skeleton, the athletes push the sled from a running position in the grooves cut into the start area. These start areas are much longer to give athletes time to accelerate the sled to max velocity before getting in.\nThose who drive the bobsled down the track are referred to as Pilots or Drivers and sit in the front of the sled and steer the runners using the ring and rope system inside. The other athletes are referred to as Push Athletes and do not contribute to the movement of the sled once they hop in. The Brakeman is the rear-most athlete in the sled in both 2-man and 4-man and they pull the brakes when the bobsled reaches the very end of the run, which is generally an uphill portion of the track.\nRecruitment.\nUSABS recruits athletes from around the United States that have competed in a wide background of sports. Sports with a large emphasis on power and speed generally develop skills that transfer the best. Common sporting backgrounds for athletes that have made Team USA include football and track &amp; field. Although athletes from other sports have made World Cup teams as well. Due to the level of collegiate sports in the United States, many athletes that enter training and competition for USABS have generally already completed all of their years at a university and step into Bobsled or Skeleton in their early to mid twenties. \nCoaches for Team USA host \"combines\" in various cities throughout the United States each summer to recruit, but in recent years, they have also allowed athletes to submit video of athletic feats through a virtual combine.

        "text": "The Kansas State Wildcats baseball team is a member of the NCAA and the Big 12 Conference. The program's first official game was in 1897.\nFollowing the completion of the 2021 season, Kansas State's all-time record is 1,904–1,897–10 ().\nHome field.\nKansas State plays its home games at Frank Myers Field at Tointon Family Stadium. The stadium was built in 1961, and re-dedicated in 2002 with major improvements including a digital scoreboard, upgraded locker-room facilities, coaches' offices, and more.\nThe team's first official home field was an open public square in Manhattan located at Bluemont Avenue and 8th Street, which it began using in the 1898 season, called Athletic Field. Construction of Bluemont Elementary School on that plot of land forced Kansas State to move its athletics on campus beginning in 1911. The team's on-campus baseball diamond was initially located at the southwest corner of the campus, at the current location of Memorial Stadium. However, in the following decades the squad played at numerous locations around Manhattan, including City Park and (for many years) Griffith Park, before the opening of the current ballpark.\nHistory.\nAccording to most sources, Kansas State began intercollegiate competition with a match against St. Mary's College on May 26, 1894. (St. Mary's was a regional athletics powerhouse, whose recent graduates included baseball pioneers Charles Comiskey and Ted Sullivan.) However, the first game reflected in the school's official history is a 4–3 win over Fort Riley on April 10, 1897. Playing in the old Kansas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the baseball team earned its first varsity championship in 1907 under coach Mike Ahearn.\nAfter joining the Missouri Valley Conference in 1913, the Kansas State baseball team won major conference titles in 1928, 1930 and 1933. The school's most recent championship was the Big 12 Conference regular season championship in 2013. Kansas State's best finish at the Big 12 Conference baseball tournament was runner-up at the 2008 tournament.\nTranscending results on the field, the team established an important milestone when Kansas State catcher Earl Woods, the father of golfer Tiger Woods, became the first African-American baseball player in the Big Seven Conference in 1951.\nRecent seasons.\nThe Wildcats have established a number of firsts for the program in recent years. The team qualified for its first NCAA tournament in 2009, and has returned three times since. Kansas State also earned its first national rankings in the \"USA Today\"/ESPN Coach's Poll in 2009, and set a new school record for wins with 43 in 2009, breaking the previous mark of 35 set in 1976.\nIn 2013, the Wildcats won the Big 12 Conference title and reestablished a new team record for wins. The school also was awarded the right to host the program's first NCAA regional. After winning the Manhattan Regional, Kansas State advanced to its first ever NCAA Super Regional. The team played at the Corvallis Super Regional, falling to the host and Pac-12 champion Oregon State Beavers. Kansas State finished ranked in the top 15 of all the major polls, the team's highest final rankings in history.\nRivalry.\nKansas State's main rival is the Kansas Jayhawks. The teams play every year in the Sunflower Showdown."

Mitchell did feature during the autumn, earning his third international Welsh cap coming on as a replacement against Samoa.\nNot initially selected in the touring squad for the 2010 summer trip to New Zealand and home test against South Africa, Mitchell was on the stand by list as injury cover.

This was to be his final appearance for Wales.\nControversy.\nIt was announced on 27 June 2013 that Mitchell had been arrested in Brisbane, Australia following the Lions first test against Australia on 22 June. Mitchell who had been in Australia as a fan admitted assault occasioning bodily harm with a circumstance of aggravation (being he was in company) after hitting Cian Barry at the Red Hill pub in Brisbane. Mitchell was sentenced to six months' imprisonment wholly suspended for two years, fined A$1,800 and ordered to pay A$3,000 in compensation to the victim. In court Mitchell described his actions as \"My actions... were totally unacceptable and unforgivable.\""

Nabhvarna are currently ranked 6th in the FIH World Rankings, and are ranked as the best team in Asia. They have won the gold medals at the 2002 Commonwealth Games and 1982 Asian Games. They have also won the Women's Asia Cup twice, i.e. in 2004 and 2017. They also won the Asian Champions Trophy 2016 and 2023.\nHistory.\nThe team's breakthrough performance came at the Women's Hockey World Cup at Mandelieu in 1974, where it finished in 4th place. Their best performance in the Olympic Games was at 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics (where they came in 4th), when a women's event was held for the first time in Olympic history. The team also won the Gold medal at the inaugural 1982 Asian Games held in New Delhi, defeating Korea in the finals. Captain Suraj Lata Devi led the team to the Gold for three consecutive years at different events- during the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, and the 2004 Women's Hockey Asia Cup. Team members were referred to as the \"assi (Jasjeet) jaisi koi nahi\" or the \"Golden Girls of Hockey,\" after the 2004 win. The team earned a 3rd-place finish at the 2013 Women's Hockey Asia Cup at Kuala Lumpur defeating China in a shootout. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, it finished in 5th place but at 2014 Asian Games, Incheon stunned Japan 2–1 in a tight match to clinch their third bronze medal at the Asian Games. During the summer of 2015, the team hosted the Round 2 of the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League and finished on top to qualify for the next stage. At the World League Semi-finals held in Antwerp the team finished in the fifth place beating higher ranked Japan in classification match.

The team entered the finals after defeating the New Zealand women's national field hockey team. and placed first, winning the Gold after they beat the English women's hockey team.\nThis event served as the inspiration for the 2007 Bollywood film about women's field hockey, \"Chak De! India\" starring Shah Rukh Khan (after screenwriter Jaideep Sahni read a short article about it). Sahni began to model the character of Kabir Khan on hockey coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik. After hearing the storyline, Kaushik suggested that Sahni meet hockey player Mir Ranjan Negi (who faced accusations of throwing the match against Pakistan during the 1982 Asian Games). Sahni has stated that he was unaware of Negi's tribulations while writing the script and that the resemblance with Negi's life was entirely coincidental. Negi affirmed this point stating that he didn't \"want to hog the limelight. This movie is not a documentary of Mir Ranjan Negi's life. It is in fact the story of a team that becomes a winning lot from a bunch of hopeless girls\". In response to the fact that the media equated Kabir Khan with Negi, Sahni said that \"Our script was written a year and a half back. It is very unfortunate that something, which is about women athletes, has just started becoming about Negi.\"\nTokyo Olympics and resurgence.\nIndia at the 2020 Summer Olympics for the first time ever, reached the semi-final in the Women's Hockey Olympic event but failed to bag any medal after they lost to Argentina in the semi-final and then to Great Britain in the bronze medal match.

Listed at and , he threw and batted left-handed.\nBiography.\nShea, nicknamed \"Lefty\", was signed by the Boston Red Sox on June 15, 1928, the day after he graduated from Boston College, where he had played college baseball. He made his first professional appearance two weeks later, on June 30; it was also Shea's only major league appearance. Hosting the New York Yankees at Fenway Park, the Red Sox were trailing, 9–3, at the end of the eighth inning in the first game of a doubleheader. Shea was brought in to pitch the top of the ninth; the first batter that he faced was Lou Gehrig, whom he walked. This was followed by a double and then three ground outs, which allowed two of the Yankees to score. Thus, Shea was charged with two earned runs in one inning pitched, for an earned run average of 18.00\nShea went on to have a brief minor league career, pitching for the Pittsfield Hillies of the Eastern League in 1928 and 1929.\nA native of Everett, Massachusetts, Shea died in 1956, aged 51, at his home in Malden, Massachusetts."

The team's match against Australia in January 1879 was retrospectively given Test match status, making it the third Test ever and the third between Australia and England, though it was not part of The Ashes which began in 1882.\nHarris' tour party arrived in Australia just two months after the touring Australians had returned from England. They were scheduled to play five tour matches, two each against New South Wales and Victoria and one against the combined Australians. Whilst in Sydney, the notorious Sydney Riot of 1879 occurred as a result of the tourists match against New South Wales. The English team, which is sometimes referred to as Lord Harris' XI, also visited New Zealand where they played a single match in Christchurch. From there, they travelled home via the Pacific and the US, stopping in Hoboken \"en route\" to play one further match there.\nThe touring team.\nHenry Maul (1850–1940), a batsman, played in eight of the minor matches on the tour, and later had a long career with Warwickshire in their pre-first-class days, but never played first-class cricket. Frank Penn, the only other tourist not to play in the Test, played in the one-off Test against Australia in 1880."

        "text": "Larry Quinn (born c. 1952) is an American ice hockey executive, businessman and politician, best known for his involvement with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL. Quinn has had two stints in the Sabres organization, the first in the 1990s as team president, and the second in the mid-to-late 2000s as managing partner, minority owner, and \"de facto\" president. Quinn, in 2014, won election to Buffalo Public Schools' board of education.\nBuffalo Sabres.\nQuinn first joined the team as President in the 1990s and was responsible for hiring general manager Darcy Regier in 1997, after he had fired then-GM John Muckler. After Quinn and Regier allowed coach Ted Nolan to leave after the end of his contract, they hired Lindy Ruff as head coach. Both Regier and Ruff would stay with the team until their respective dismissals in 2013. Quinn assisted then-owners Northrup R. Knox and Seymour H. Knox III in securing the construction of what is now the KeyBank Center and the abandonment of Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Quinn first served as President and CEO of the Sabres from 1 November 1996 to 9 April 1998. The Sabres compiled a record of 69 wins, 48 losses and 27 ties and captured the Northeast division title in 1997 and advanced to the conference finals in 1998.\nQuinn was let go in 1998 as John Rigas took over the franchise. Four years later, the Adelphia Communications scandal led to the league taking over the team. Quinn associated himself with the prospective ownership group led by Tom Golisano, initially serving as a consultant. When investor Hormoz Mansouri left the ownership group, Quinn stepped in and was rewarded with a minority stake in the franchise. When Golisano closed on his purchase of the team on 12 March 2004, Quinn was named managing partner and CEO of the franchise.\nQuinn resigned on 22 February 2011 when the team was purchased by Terry Pegula. The Sabres compiled a record 300 wins, 200 losses, 5 ties and 57 overtime losses and won the Presidents trophy in 2007 and the northeast division title in 2007 and 2010. The Sabres advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2006 and 2007.\nQuinn oversaw the first NHL Winter Classic held on 1 January 2008 at Ralph Wilson Stadium.\nTed Black assumed Quinn's non-hockey duties upon Pegula's assumption of ownership; the title of President was left vacant until Pat LaFontaine's hiring in November 2013.\nBusiness and political ventures.\nA real estate developer by trade, Quinn served as vice chairman of the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation. He was a significant advocate of the proposed, but ultimately unsuccessful, bid to bring a Bass Pro Shops supercenter to downtown Buffalo. Quinn left the ECHDC upon leaving the Sabres organization in 2011. Although Quinn initially left Western New York after his second tenure with the Sabres, he returned by February 2014 to announce his intent to run for Buffalo Public Schools' board of education. He won that race, running on an alliance with sitting board member Carl Paladino.\nLarry's son, Matt Quinn, is a television producer who works on political campaigns."

Elliott was a three-time academic and athletic All-American at the University of Arizona, leading his team to a Western Athletic Conference championship and two NCAA tournament appearances. He was a 1977 Third Team All American, a 1975, 1976 and 1977 Third Team All-WAC conference honoree, and a 1975, 1976, and 1977 Academic All American. Elliott received a bachelor of science in accounting, and later, an MBA from the University of Arizona as well. He is a past chairman of the Retired NBA Players Association.\nUniversity of Arizona basketball.\nElliott came to the University of Arizona from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many Arizona basketball advocates credit the young Elliott for introducing modern Arizona basketball to the nation under the coaching style of Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden (the first black head basketball coach in D1 collegiate basketball). At a time when UCLA was the west coast powerhouse athletic program, Tucson worked to move from being a small \"Old Pueblo\" town with a great university to the U of A metropolis that it is today. Sold-out games and revenue from the Snowden Era put basketball in the spotlight. Elliott was described as having \"one of the best drop steps you will ever see.\" He had an 18.6 career scoring average while in college between 1973–1977. He is still second, behind Sean Elliott, on the University of Arizona's all time records list with 2,131 points, field goals (808), attempted field goals (1,512), free throws (515), and attempted free throws (767). He scored 39 points against Utah in 1977, which is noted as the fourth best all-time single game performance at U of A.\nNBA career.\nElliott was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA, but never played for them. He spent half a year playing basketball in Europe and three seasons with the New Jersey Nets. Following his NBA career, Elliott briefly played for the Detroit Spirits of the Continental Basketball Association during the 1982–83 season.\nEA Sports.\nElliott may be best known in younger generations for his voice work as a color-commentator on NBA Live games with late sportscaster (and former Memphis Grizzlies announcer) Don Poier from 1999 to 2003.\nCommunity involvement.\nElliott is involved with multiple charities and has established a scholarship in the names of him and his wife through the University of Arizona.

Co-written by Elliott's teammate and former NBA player Eric Money, it discusses the rise of basketball's popularity, being the first team to play in McKale center, the racial barriers that were broken, and the undying support of Tucson for the players. The book also pays homage to the Arizona basketball teams of the pre-Snowden era, through Lute Olson, and into Sean Miller.c.\nPersonal life.\nElliott currently resides in Tucson, Arizona. He and his wife Beverely have four adult children and ten grandchildren. Elliott also owns a successful accounting practice, Elliott Accounting Group, in Tucson that has been active for over 30 years."

        "title": "Women in baseball",
        "text": "Women have a long history in American baseball and many women's teams have existed over the years. Baseball was played at women's colleges in New York and New England as early as the mid-nineteenth century; teams were formed at Vassar College, Smith College, Wellesley College, and Mount Holyoke College. An African American women's team, the Philadelphia Dolly Vardens, was formed in 1867.\nA number of women's barnstorming teams have existed, and women have played alongside major league players in exhibition games. On April 2, 1931, 17-year-old Jackie Mitchell (originally known as \"Virne Beatrice Mitchell Gilbert\") of the Chattanooga Lookouts struck out both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game. Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided her contract as a result. The first girl to play on a boys varsity high school baseball team was Nellie Twardzik, on April 24, 1935. Twardzik started at first base for the Bartlett High School Indians in Webster, Massachusetts from 1935 through 1937. Her high school letter and glove are on display in the \"Diamond Dreams\" exhibit featuring women in baseball at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\nIn 1946, former player Edith Houghton became the first woman to work as an independent scout in Major League Baseball when she was hired by the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. In 1989, NBC's Gayle Gardner became the first woman to regularly host Major League Baseball games for a major television network. In 2015, Jessica Mendoza was the first female analyst for a Major League Baseball game in the history of ESPN, and Margaret Donahue (1892–1978) was the first non-owner female front office executive in Major League Baseball, starting as a stenographer for the Chicago Cubs in 1919 before becoming the team's corporate secretary in 1926 and team vice president and executive secretary before she retired in 1958.\nEffa Manley, the only woman member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame (inducted 2006), co-owned the Newark Eagles baseball franchise in the Negro leagues from 1935 to 1948.\nEarly history.\nWomen were playing base ball (as it was then called) as far back as the 1860s, but it was not normal for young women to play what was considered a man's sport. In fact, until the early 1890s, when the bicycle craze hit America, women who wanted to get some outdoor exercise were usually discouraged from doing so. Nevertheless, baseball was played at women's colleges in New York and New England as early as the mid-nineteenth century; teams were formed at Vassar College, Smith College, Wellesley College, and Mount Holyoke College. An African American women's team, the Philadelphia Dolly Vardens, was formed in 1867.\nIn the late 1890s, there were some organized efforts to have all-female baseball teams, several of which enjoyed success. One of the most successful was the Boston Bloomer Girls baseball club; they took their name from the comfortable pants that some sports-minded young women had begun to wear instead of a long skirt. Young women who went against traditional fashion norms and chose bloomers were often called \"bloomer girls\". While in some cities, local authorities banned women's baseball teams, including the Bloomer Girls, in other cities, the club was welcomed by curious fans who had never seen female ballplayers.\nThe Bloomer Girls toured the United States in 1897; the press referred to them as the \"champion women's club of the world\", although this may have been marketing hyperbole, given that the team often seemed inexperienced and did not play very well. One regular standout for the Bloomers was pitcher Maud Nelson, whose talents as a player were praised by reporters; but her teammates did not seem to have as much polish or skill as she did. As they gained more experience, they began to play with more confidence; while still regarded as a novelty, the club often drew large crowds of appreciative fans, many of whom came to see Maud Nelson and her curve ball. The Boston Bloomers were still touring and playing baseball in the early 1900s; by 1907–1908, their team also included several male players, but the majority of the team continued to be female.\nOn July 5, 1898, Lizzie Arlington became the first woman to play for a professional men's baseball team when she pitched the ninth inning for the Reading Coal Heavers against the Allentown Peanuts. Reading was leading 5–0 heading into the final inning when Arlington entered the game. Though she allowed two hits and walked a batter to load the bases, Arlington succeeded in retiring the next three batters to preserve the victory, as the crowd enthusiastically shouted \"Good for Lizzie!\"\nMargaret Donahue (1892–1978) was the first non-owner female front office executive in Major League Baseball, starting as a stenographer for the Chicago Cubs in 1919 before becoming the team's corporate secretary in 1926 and team vice president and executive secretary before she retired in 1958.\n1920s–present.\nPerhaps the best known young woman playing baseball in the early 1920s was Rhode Island's Lizzie Murphy. A first baseman, she played for the Providence (RI) Independents, and was praised by newspaper reporters for her fielding skills. Sportswriters said she was every bit as talented as a male player, and noted that she was paid $300 a week, more than many minor league players of the 1920s received. Murphy, who had begun playing baseball when she was only ten, had dreams of becoming a major league player, but she was not able to achieve that goal. She did in 1922 become the first female baseball player to play against major league players, in a game that was a charity exhibition pitting all-star players from the New England and American Leagues against the Boston Red Sox. She was also able to have a long career in the semi-pro leagues, leading a touring team that played all over the eastern United States. According to newspaper accounts, she developed a loyal following, with numerous fans who came out to watch her and her team play. Lizzie Murphy's baseball career lasted from 1918 to 1935.\nWhile Murphy was perhaps the best-known woman playing for an all-male team in the 1920s, there was at least one other woman athlete whose abilities included playing baseball. Philadelphia's Betty Schenkel not only played baseball with the boys during high school, but she was said to be adept in other sports, including basketball, soccer, and cycling.\nOn April 2, 1931, 17-year-old Jackie Mitchell (originally known as \"Virne Beatrice Mitchell Gilbert\") of the Chattanooga Lookouts struck out both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in an exhibition game. Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided her contract as a result. \nThe first girl to play on a boys varsity high school baseball team was Nellie Twardzik, on April 24, 1935. Twardzik started at first base for the Bartlett High School Indians in Webster, Massachusetts from 1935 through 1937. Her high school letter and glove are on display in the \"Diamond Dreams\" exhibit featuring women in baseball at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\nEffa Manley, the only woman member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame (inducted 2006), co-owned the Newark Eagles baseball franchise in the Negro leagues from 1935 to 1948.\nWorld War II through 1950.\nDuring World War II, over 500 baseball players, including super-stars like Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio, were drafted. This left major league rosters depleted and severely diminished the level of talent in the league. The owner of the Chicago Cubs, Philip K. Wrigley formed a committee to come up with ideas to keep baseball financially afloat during the war. The result of that committee was the organization of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which operated from 1943 to 1954. At the height of its popularity, it had teams in twelve cities. One of the most successful of the teams in the league was the Rockford (IL) Peaches, which won four championships. The Peaches, and the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, were commemorated in a 1992 movie, \"A League of Their Own\", starring Geena Davis. In 2022, the television series \"A League of Their Own\", co-created by Will Graham and Abbi Jacobson, was an adaptation of the 1992 movie with new characters and storylines, about the formation of a World War II-era women's professional baseball team.\nFounded for similar reasons as the AAGPBL, the National Girls Baseball League was in operation from 1944 to 1954.\nIn 1946, former player Edith Houghton became the first woman to work as an independent scout in Major League Baseball when she was hired by the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. \n1950s–1990s.\nThere not being a rule against it, 12-year-old Kathryn Johnston of Corning, New York became the first girl to play Little League Baseball in 1950. Johnston played first base for the King's Dairy team. After that, a rule prohibited girls from playing in Little League; this was in force until 1974. In the final week of December 1974, President Gerald Ford signed into law a bill that opened the Little League baseball program to girls.\nIn 1952 Major League Baseball began a ban on the signing of women to contracts, a ban that lasted until 1992.\nThe Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro leagues were the first professional baseball team to hire a female player to a long-term contract that was not voided soon after. In an effort to replace Hank Aaron, who had left the team the previous year, the Clowns hired Toni Stone to play second base with the team in 1953, in which she batted .243. \nIn 1988, Julie Croteau was recognized as the first woman to play men's NCAA baseball.\nStarting in 1989 and continuing to date (July 2021), Janet Marie Smith oversaw multiple MLB stadium projects for the Baltimore Orioles, the Atlanta Braves, the Boston Red Sox, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smith directed the design of Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards which marked a new era of MLB parks. Camden Yards was the first of the \"Retro Ballparks,\" and was unique in that it honored many qualities of ballparks from the classic era ballparks like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, but also incorporated modern elements and building techniques to improve the overall fan experience as well as the views. Smith's work in major league baseball stadium design and renovation has influenced ballpark design since 1992. \"Every ballpark built since Oriole Park’s opening owes some debt of its design to that park.\" Oriole Park became known as \"the Baltimore ballpark that changed baseball.\" Janet Marie Smith's \"fingerprints are all over baseball.\"\nIn 1992 Major League Baseball lifted a ban on the signing of women to contracts, a ban that had begun in 1952.\nSince 1992, the San Francisco Giants have employed older men as “balldudes”, instead of the traditional youths. In 1993, Corinne Mullane became the first \"balldudette\", and she and her daughter Molly, who began working as a balldudette in the 2000s, have since been included in the National Baseball Hall of Fame as the first mother-daughter ball-retrieving duo in baseball.\nIn the 1993 MLB draft, the Chicago White Sox drafted left handed pitcher Carey Schueler in the 43rd round. She was the first woman ever drafted by a Major League Baseball team.\nIn 1994, the Colorado Silver Bullets women's professional baseball team was founded, in which the women players barnstormed around the country playing men's professional and semi-professional teams. They won six of 40 games in their inaugural season, improving to a final winning season of 23–22 in their final year, 1997. Croteau played with the Colorado Silver Bullets in its inaugural season. After one season, she and teammate Lee Anne Ketcham joined the Maui Stingrays of the Hawaii Winter Baseball League, becoming the first women to play in the Major League Baseball-sanctioned league.\nIn 1995, Ila Borders became the first woman to start as pitcher in a men's collegiate baseball game.\n2000s.\nEffa Manley, the only woman member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, was inducted into it in 2006. She co-owned the Newark Eagles baseball franchise in the Negro leagues from 1935 to 1948.\nIn 2008, Eri Yoshida, at 16 years old, became Japan's first professional female baseball player to play in a men's league by signing a professional contract with a new Japanese independent league. In April 2010, she signed a contract with the Chico Outlaws, becoming the first woman to play professionally in two countries.\nIn 2008, Mamie \"Peanut\" Johnson was drafted (at age 72) by the Washington Nationals in a special Negro leagues honorary draft that preceded 2008 Major League Baseball draft, marking the first time a woman was drafted in the MLB's yearly new player draft.\nIn 2009, Justine Siegal became the first female coach of a men's professional baseball team. In 2011, she was the first woman to throw batting practice to an MLB team, the Cleveland Indians at spring training. She also threw BP to the Oakland Athletics, Tampa Bay Rays, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and New York Mets. In 2015, Siegal became the Oakland Athletics guest instructor for their Instructional League Club, thus making her the first female coach in major league baseball history.\nOn August 15, 2014, Mo'ne Davis was the first girl in Little League World Series history to pitch a winning game (for the Taney Dragons), which also made her the first girl to pitch a shutout in Little League postseason history.\nFor one day in May 2016, Jennie Finch was a guest manager for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League, becoming the first woman to manage a professional baseball team. The team played and won one game that day.\nIn 2016, the Sonoma Stompers of the Pacific Association, an independent baseball league, signed Kelsie Whitmore and Stacy Piagno; they became the first female teammates in professional baseball since the 1950s in the Negro Leagues. Whitmore pitched to Anna Kimbrell during a game in 2016, forming the first all-female battery since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\nIn January 2021, Boston Red Sox hired Bianca Smith as a minor league coach. With the hire, Smith was the first black woman to become a coach in professional baseball. On January 11, 2022, the Yankees announced that Rachel Balkovec would manage the Low-A Tampa Tarpons in 2022, making her the first woman to manage in affiliated baseball.\nIn May 2022, Kelsie Whitmore signed with the Staten Island FerryHawks of the Atlantic League, and started a game for them in left field; this made her the first woman to start an Atlantic League of Professional Baseball game. Slightly later in May she became the first woman to pitch in an Atlantic League game when she made her first pitching appearance for Staten Island; entering the game with the bases loaded and two outs, she retired Ryan Jackson, a former major leaguer, on a fly out to end the inning.\nJaida Lee, at 16 years old, was in August 2022 the first female to compete in men’s baseball at the Canada Summer Games.\nIn November 2022, Olivia Pichardo became the first woman chosen for any Division I baseball roster when she was chosen for that of Brown University. Pichardo became the first woman to play in a Division I baseball game on March 17, 2023, pinch-hitting for Brown University.\nIn January 2023, Veronica Gajownik was hired to manage the Hillsboro Hops, which made her the first woman to manage a Class High-A baseball team, and the first openly LGBTQ manager in minor or major league baseball history.\nIn 2023 Jocelyn Alo became the first woman to play for the Savannah Bananas, getting an at bat in one of their games. In 2024 it was announced that Alo had become the first female member of the Savannah Bananas, by signing a one-month contract with them.\nAlso in 2024, the video game \"\" enabled users to create and play as a female baseball player for the first time.\nBroadcasting.\nIn 1989, NBC's Gayle Gardner became the first woman to regularly host Major League Baseball games for a major television network. In 1990, CBS Sports' Lesley Visser became the first woman to cover the World Series, serving as their lead field reporter. In addition to working the World Series from 1990–1993 for CBS, Visser covered the 1995 World Series for ABC Sports via The Baseball Network.\nOn August 3, 1993, Gayle Gardner became the first woman to do television play-by-play for a Major League Baseball game. It was the Colorado Rockies vs. Cincinnati Reds on KWGN-TV in Denver. Also in 1993, CBS' Andrea Joyce became the first woman to co-host the network television coverage of the World Series. Joyce co-hosted that particular World Series with Pat O'Brien.\nIn 1995, NBC's Hannah Storm not only became the first woman to serve as solo host a World Series game, but also the first woman to preside over the World Series Trophy presentation. In 2009, New York Yankees broadcaster Suzyn Waldman became the first woman to work a World Series game from the broadcast booth.\nOn July 2, 2015, Jenny Cavnar became the first woman to provide analysis for a series of National League games in the radio booth, filling in on KOA for the Colorado Rockies vs Arizona Diamondbacks. Cavnar would also become the fill-in play-by-play voice for the Colorado Rockies on April 23, 2018, when she stepped in the booth to call the San Diego Padres at Colorado Rockies. On August 24, 2015, Jessica Mendoza was the first female analyst for a Major League Baseball game in the history of ESPN, during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks. John Kruk, Dan Shulman and Jessica Mendoza called the 2015 American League Wild Card Game on October 6, and Mendoza thus became the first female analyst in MLB postseason history. In October 2020 Mendoza became the first female World Series analyst on any national broadcast platform; she was on ESPN's radio platform.\nOn July 20, 2021, MLB produced its first-ever all-female broadcast of a game between the Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Rays. The game was called by Melanie Newman, MLB.com writer Sarah Langs, and Alanna Rizzo. Heidi Watney and Lauren Gardner hosted the pregame and postgame shows. The game was broadcast live on YouTube. ESPN would do the same on September 29, 2021, with Newman and Mendoza calling a game between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nBefore the 2024 season, the Oakland Athletics hired Jenny Cavnar as their full-time play-by-play announcer, making her the first female primary play-by-play announcer in MLB history.\nUmpires.\nThere is evidence that at least one woman, Amanda Clement, was umpiring semi-professional games as early as 1905. \"Mandy\", as she was called, grew up near a ballpark in her hometown of Hudson, South Dakota, where she was introduced to baseball by her brother Henry. Clement began umpiring while a student at Yankton College, and gained fame nationwide for her knowledge of baseball and her accuracy in umpiring the games. She was paid between $10 and $15 per game, which helped pay her tuition. She umpired games in North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota until at least 1909, and later became a physical education instructor for high school and college women's teams. She still would umpire an occasional semi-pro game in South Dakota even during the 1910s. There were several other woman umpires in the early 1920s: one was Deana Ernest of Toledo, Ohio, who umpired semi-pro games in the area, and also managed a city league team there. Another was Nina Belle Hurst, a resident of Sawtelle, California, who umpired in the Southern California Baseball Managers Association. During World War II, there were also some women who umpired, including some the press jokingly referred to as \"WUMPS\" (women umpires). Among them was Lorraine Heinisch, of Kenosha WI, who umpired semi-pro games in 1943, including a championship game in Wichita, Kansas.\nThe first woman to umpire a professional game was Bernice Gera. A former Little League coach and a passionate fan of baseball, she entered umpiring school in 1967 (the first woman ever to attend the Fort Lauderdale Baseball School). After a lengthy court battle with major league baseball, she finally won the right to umpire. Her first pro game was in the minor leagues in June 1972, a game between the Auburn Phillies and Geneva Rangers in the New York-Penn League, but after several disputed calls, she decided to resign and never umpired another professional game.\nIn 1988 Pam Postema became the first female umpire to officiate a Major League Baseball spring training game, and the last until Ria Cortesio in 2007. Since 2017, Jen Pawol has been active as an umpire in the minor leagues.\nExecutives.\nThe first woman to own a baseball team was Helene Hathaway Britton, who owned the St. Louis Cardinals National League baseball team from 1911 through 1916. Margaret Donahue was the first female front office executive in Major League Baseball who was not an owner. She worked for the Chicago Cubs from 1919 to 1958 and introduced marketing concepts such as the season ticket and reduced prices for children under 12, both still used in the 2000s. Since then, many women have held executive positions in business and financial areas of Major League Baseball. Yet, there have not been many women who have become player personnel, though, there are women who have been hired as general managers (GMs) for minor league affiliates. However, these positions are not responsible for player personnel moves, since roster maneuvers are handled by front-office personnel of the minor league affiliate's major league parent team.\nOne woman who has a position in player personnel at the Major League level is Kim Ng. She first worked for the Chicago White Sox, where she successfully presented an arbitration case. After working for the American League as director of waivers and records, she was hired as Assistant GM by the New York Yankees. When she left the Yankees in 2001 for the same position with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Yankees hired another woman to replace her, Jean Afterman. Afterman still holds the same position as of July 2015. Kim Ng later moved on to work for Major League Baseball as Senior Vice President of Baseball Operations. In 2020, she was hired by the Miami Marlins as the first woman and first Asian American to serve as general manager of an MLB team.\nCoaching.\nSeveral women have made milestone firsts as coaches, including:"

        "title": "Badminton Library",
        "text": "The Badminton Library, called in full The Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes, was a sporting and publishing project conceived by Longmans Green &amp; Co. and edited by Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort (1824–1899). Between 1885 and 1902 it developed into a series of sporting books which aimed to cover comprehensively all major sports and pastimes. The books were published in London by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. and in Boston by Little, Brown &amp; Co.\nThe series was dedicated to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, \"one of the best and keenest sportsmen of our time\".\nEditor.\nThe founder of the Library, the Duke of Beaufort, acted as its overseeing editor, assisted by Alfred E. T. Watson, and chose authors who were authorities in their fields. Explaining his purpose, the Duke said: \nDescription.\nThe \"Badminton Library\" was originally published in twenty-eight volumes between 1885 and 1896. To these was later added \"Rowing &amp; Punting\" (1898), superseding \"Boating\" (1888). New volumes for \"Athletics\" (1898) and \"Football\" (1899) supplemented the original \"Athletics and Football\" (1887). In 1902, the final entirely new volume, \"Motors and Motor-Driving\", covered a new sport, and lastly there was a new edition of \"Cricket\" in 1920.\nOn the combining of athletics and football in a single volume, Mike Huggins says in \"The Victorians and Sport\" (2004) that it suggests \"...that football's leading place was not yet assured amongst the more literate reading public.\"\nThe original volume on \"Cricket\" (1888) has sixteen chapters on topics such as 'Batting', 'Bowling', 'Fielding', and 'Umpires'. It defines the Marylebone Cricket Club as \"The Parliament of Cricket\" and describes the sport as \"Our National Game\". Allan Gibson Steel wrote the chapter on bowling.\n\"Cycling\" (1887), by Viscount Bury, notes that riding the tricycle and bicycle, whether by women or by men, \"is by far the most recent of all sports in the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes. There is none which has developed more rapidly in the last few years.\" It considers that \"England may be looked upon as the Home of Cycling\" and quotes Thomas Huxley's words to the Royal Society: \"Since the time of Achilles, no improvement had added anything to the speed or strength attainable by the unassisted powers of man\", commenting that a bicyclist had recently raced 146 miles in only ten hours.\n\"Skating\" (1892) deals first with 'Origins and Development', 'Figure skating', and 'Recreation and Racing', noting that Holland was \"the Skater's Paradise\" and giving a list of racing records since the 1820s, then continues with chapters on Curling, Tobogganing, Ice-Sailing and Bandy.\nLaura and Guy Waterman's \"Yankee Rock &amp; Ice\" (2002) calls the Badminton Library \"a quaint turn-of-the-century British series\", while a review of the publication \"Collectors Guide to the Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes\" says of the books: \nTwo useful series for purposes of comparison are the slightly later \"American Sportsman's Library\" and the \"Lonsdale Library of Sports, Games and Pastimes\" (Seeley, Service &amp; Co.).\nEditions.\nThe \"Badminton Library\" was published in three different formats:\nName.\nThe name 'Badminton Library' was derived from that of Duke of Beaufort's principal country house, Badminton in Gloucestershire. There is no volume in the series on the sport of Badminton, named after the same house.\nIn fiction.\nJ. K. Stanford's fictional game shot George Hysteron-Proteron was said to have been educated at Eton, the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the \"Badminton Library\"."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected Warren Giles and Hack Wilson. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 5, 1979, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding. The annual Hall of Fame Game, an exhibition contest, was played the following day; this was the first time that the induction ceremony and game were held on different days.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1959 or later, but not after 1973; the ballot included players whose last appearance was in 1973. Originally a selection committee met and decided that only Willie Mays and Luis Aparicio were first year players deserving of being on the ballot, but after a protest by Milt Pappas, all eligible first-year candidates were placed on the ballot.\nAll 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. A new rule affecting candidate eligibility was put in place in 1979 placing importance on a candidate receiving 5% of votes. The thirty-one players affected by this rule who would not appear on the 1980 ballot are marked with an asterisk (*).\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 54 players; a total of 432 ballots were cast, with 324 votes required for election. A total of 3,327 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.70 per ballot.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nEnos Slaughter and Bobby Thomson were on the ballot for the final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 11 All-Stars, representing a total of 51 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 20-time All-Star Willie Mays and 10-time All-Star Luis Aparicio. The field included one MVP (Mays, who won twice), and four Rookies of the Year (Tommy Agee, Luis Aparicio, Frank Howard and Willie Mays).\nIn addition, Willie Mays had 12 Gold Gloves at Outfield, tied for most all-time with Roberto Clemente, and Luis Aparicio had 9 Gold Gloves at Shortstop, the record at the time.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nTim Murnane (1851–1917) and Dick Young (1917–1987) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring baseball writers. The awards were voted at the December 1978 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1979 ceremonies."

The race was to be run over 30 laps of the little circuit, but this was reduced to 20 laps due to the bad weather. The race was won by British driver John Coombs in a Lotus Mk VIII.\nThis was the second of three Formula One races held in Cornwall during 1954 and 1955, and the first Formula One race to be won by a Lotus.\nRodney Nuckey led the race until lap 17, when he suffered oil pressure problems, leaving Coombs and Tom Kyffin to battle for the lead until the end."

        "text": "The 2008–2009 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics was a multi race competition over a season of track cycling. The season ran from 31 October 2008 to 18 February 2009. The World Cup is organised by the Union Cycliste Internationale.\nThe World Cup kicked off in Manchester, Great Britain on 31 October 2008. Although many of the top riders did not participate in this round, as they were still recovering from the 2008 Summer Olympics, this gave many less experienced riders an opportunity to make their mark in the competition.\n171 riders were on the start list for the second round in Melbourne, Australia, held from 20 to 22 November 2008. New talent was prevalent once more, demonstrated by Cyclingnews' statistics which showed that 100 of those riders were under the age of 23 and only 12 were over 30.\nThe third round was held at the newly renovated Alcides Nieto Patiño Velodrome in Cali, Colombia from 12 to 14 December 2008. 166 athletes competed in this round, representing 30 different countries.\nFor the fourth round, held from 16 to 18 January 2009, riders returned to the Beijing velodrome in China for the first time since the 2008 Summer Olympics. Temperatures in the velodrome were much lower than the sweltering heat experienced by the riders during the summer, this time it was approximately 16 degrees indoors.\nThe fifth and final round was held in Copenhagen, Denmark from 13 to 15 February 2009. British paralympic rider Darren Kenny also made an appearance at Copenhagen, a world record attempt had been scheduled during the World Cup, on 14 February. Kenny intended to attempt to break his own CP 3 World Hour Record of 41.817 km which was set in Manchester on 8 January 2005.\nAs the five rounds of the World Cup were held scattered around the world, only a few riders were able to participate in every round. Those who attended the first two rounds were able to rise to the top of the overall series standings, this led to many unfamiliar names appearing at the top of the rankings.\nOverall team standings.\nOverall team standings are calculated based on total number of points gained by the team's riders in each event. With one round remaining, 60 teams have so far participated in the 2008–2009 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics. The top ten teams are listed below:"

        "title": "International Ice Hockey Federation",
        "text": "The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF; ; ) is a worldwide governing body for ice hockey. It is based in Zurich, Switzerland, and has 82 member countries.\nThe IIHF maintains the IIHF World Ranking based on international ice hockey tournaments. Rules of play for IIHF events differ from hockey in North America and the rules of the National Hockey League (NHL). Decisions of the IIHF can be appealed through the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IIHF maintains its own hall of fame for international ice hockey. The IIHF Hall of Fame was founded in 1997, and has been located within the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1998.\nPreviously, the IIHF also managed the development of inline hockey; however, in June 2019, the IIHF announced that they would no longer govern inline hockey or organize the Inline Hockey World Championships.\nFunctions.\nThe main functions of the IIHF are to govern, develop and organize hockey throughout the world. Another duty is to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the sport.\nThe federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its statutes, bylaws and regulations as well as in holding a clear jurisdiction with regards to ice hockey at the international level. The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the sponsorships, license rights, advertising and merchandising in connection with all IIHF competitions.\nAnother purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players' development and in the development of coaches and game officials. On the other hand, all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups. The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players' transfers. It is also the body that presides over ice hockey at the Olympic Games as well as over all levels of the IIHF World Championships. The federation works in collaboration with local committees when organizing its 25 World Championships, at five different categories.\nThe IIHF is also responsible for the organization of European club competitions such as the Champions Hockey League or the Continental Cup.\nThe federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body, which is the Council. The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard to the game's rules, the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation. It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board. The president of the IIHF is the representative of the federation. He represents the federation's interests in all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federation's statutes and regulations. The president is assisted by the General Secretary, who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF.\nHistory.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation was founded on 15 May 1908 at 34 Rue de Provence in Paris, France, as Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The 1920 Olympics were the first to integrate hockey into their program.\nThe 1928 Winter Olympics, which also served as the World and European Championship for the year, saw a record 11 countries participate.\nThe Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which had caused Hungary to be occupied by the Soviet Army, led to a boycott of the 1957 World Championships, which were being staged in Moscow. Canada and the United States led the boycott, and were joined by Norway, West Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.\nThe 1962 World Championship, hosted by the American cities of Colorado Springs and Denver, was boycotted by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which led to a further boycott by the other Eastern Bloc countries. At issue was the boycott of the 1957 championships in Moscow by Canada and the United States, and the Americans refusal of East German passports in reaction to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany.\nFor the 1965–66 season, the IIHF created the European Cup, a tournament consisting of the top club teams from around Europe. The competition was originated by Günther Sabetzki, based on the Association football European Cup (now UEFA Champions League). In 1968 the IIHF organized the European U19 Championship, a junior competition for players aged 19 and under. The age limit was later reduced to 18 in 1977.\nDuring the 1980s Canada stopped boycotting the World Championships and Olympic Games. The Canadians had boycotted these tournaments between 1970 and 1976 after the IIHF had refused to allow them to roster professional players at the World Championships from NHL teams that had not qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. President Sabetzki found a compromise that resulted in the return of Canada to international events beginning in 1977. The pro players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs were allowed to compete and in exchange, Canada agreed to participate in the World Championships. They also waived their right to host any World Championships. The creation of the Canada Cup (a competition organized by the NHL in Canada every four years) was also part of the new agreement between the IIHF and North American professional hockey.\nThe IIHF continued to grow in numbers during the 1980s and 1990s, both due to political events and the continued growth of hockey worldwide. The dissolution of the Soviet Union saw its membership transferred to Russia, and the addition of four ex-Soviet republics; Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to the federation. In addition, the memberships of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - all of which had initially joined the IIHF in the 1930s but were expelled following their annexation by the Soviet Union - were renewed. The breakup of Yugoslavia also resulted in an increase in membership. Croatia and Slovenia joined as new members, while the membership of the old Yugoslavia was transferred to FR Yugoslavia (which later became known as Serbia and Montenegro and still later dissolved into the independent republics of Serbia and Montenegro). When Czechoslovakia broke up, its membership rights were transferred to the Czech Republic, and Slovakia was admitted as a new member. The influx of new members resulted in the IIHF increasing the size of the Group A tournament. It expanded from 8 teams to 12 in 1992 and from 12 to 16 in 1998.\nThe IIHF celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008. As part of the celebrations, the 2008 World Championship was held in Canada for the first time (the tournament was co-hosted by the cities of Halifax and Quebec City).\nThe number of members grew in the 21st century: Chile (2000), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2001), Liechtenstein (2001), North Macedonia (2001), the United Arab Emirates (2001), Macau (2005), Malaysia (2006), Moldova (2008; presumably expelled from IIHF membership in 2023), Georgia (2009), Kuwait (2009; had originally joined in 1985, but was expelled in 1992), Morocco (2010), Kyrgyzstan (2011), Jamaica (2012), Qatar (2012), Oman (2014), Turkmenistan (2015), Indonesia (2016), Nepal (2016), the Philippines (2016), Algeria (2019), Colombia (2019), Iran (2019), Lebanon (2019), Uzbekistan (2019), Tunisia (2021), and Puerto Rico (2022).\nThe IIHF received international criticism for holding the 2014 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships in Belarus, because of the poor human rights record of the country. Several human rights organisations launched the \"Don't play with the dictator!\" boycott campaign and there were appeals from the US Congress, the German Parliament, and the European Parliament. \nThe IIHF again received criticism for planning to partly hold the 2021 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships in Belarus. In January 2021, the IIHF withdrew the 2021 World Championship from Minsk due to safety and security issues during the political unrest, besides the COVID-19 pandemic and decided to solely hold the tournament in Riga, Latvia.\nOn 23 May 2021, civilian Ryanair Flight 4978, which was enroute from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in Minsk and a passenger of that flight was detained. In protest, Latvian officials replaced the Belarusian state flag in Riga with the former flag associated with the Belarusian opposition groups, including at the 2021 IIHF World Championship display of flags. This was by order of Mayor of Riga Mārtiņš Staķis and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs. The IIHF issued a statement protesting the replacement of the flag, and IIHF president René Fasel asked the mayor to remove the IIHF name, its flag and its symbols from such sites, or to restore the flag, insisting that the IIHF is an \"apolitical sports organization\". In response, Staķis said he would remove the IIHF flags.\nOn 28 February 2022, the IIHF suspended the memberships of the Russian and Belarusian ice hockey federations until further notice due to the countries' invasion of Ukraine.\nStill, non-Russian players in Russian clubs are according to IIHF rules bound by their contracts, and cannot leave their clubs and Russia until their contracts expire or are terminated by their club. If players leave anyway they can be sued and would be blocked from playing for other clubs.\nOn 22 March 2023, the IIHF excluded Russian and Belarusian national and club teams from IIHF competitions during the 2023–24 season, based on safety considerations.\nIIHF Hall of Fame.\nPrior to the establishment of the IIHF Hall of Fame, the IIHF displayed a collection of historical artifacts from World Championships and the Olympic Games in temporary exhibits. From 1992 to 1997, the IIHF loaned its exhibits to the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.\nThe first step taken by the IIHF to create its own hall of fame was a proposal made in 1996, which was later ratified at the 1997 IIHF summer congress to host the museum in Zürich. The approval came exactly 89 years from the foundation of the IIHF, with the purpose of honoring former international ice hockey players, builders (administrators) and officials. The annual induction ceremony takes place on the medal presentation day of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The IIHF agreed with the National Hockey League to transfer its exhibits to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada, as of 29 July 1998.\nTournaments.\nDevlopemental.\nSince 2017, the IIHF has sanctioned the IIHF Development Cup for developing men's and women's national teams that do not qualify to compete in the IIHF World Championships.\nExecutives and personnel.\nThe IIHF employs twenty staff members at the headquarters in Zurich.\nMembers.\nAs of 2024, the IIHF has 82 members.\nThe federation has 60 full members, including two suspended members: Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus (suspended), Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, North Korea, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia (suspended), Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Full members have a national body dedicated to the sport, and participate annually in the international championships. Only full members have voting rights.\nIn addition, there are 21 associate members who either do not have a national body dedicated to the sport, or do not regularly participate in the international championships (Chile would be 22nd but is still listed as 'affiliate' despite having ice hockey now). They are Algeria, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Greece, Indonesia, Jamaica, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Macau, Morocco, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan.\nBy division.\nMen.\nThe following are countries who will compete in the 2024 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships, divided by tier:\nMen U20.\nThe following are countries who will compete in the 2025 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, divided by tier:\nWomen.\nThe following are countries who are competing in the 2024 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships, divided by tier:\nRegistered players.\nBased on the number of registered ice hockey players, including male, female and junior, provided by the respective countries' federations. This list includes 71 out of 82 IIHF member countries with more than 100 registered players as of October 2022.\nIIHF World Ranking.\nThe IIHF World Ranking is a tool to reflect the long-term quality of the countries' national team program. The IIHF World Ranking is released following each IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship and the Olympic Ice Hockey Tournament."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle was a swimming event held as part of the swimming at the 1920 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourth appearance of the event. A total of 31 swimmers from 15 nations competed in the event, which was held from August 22 to August 29, 1920. Nations were limited to four swimmers each. The United States swept the medals, and Duke Kahanamoku broke his own Olympic record in the semifinals and bettered his time again in the final to successfully defend his championship from 1912. Kahanamoku was the first man to successfully defend an Olympic 100 metres freestyle title (excluding Charles Daniels's win in the 1906 Intercalated Games) and third man to win multiple medals of any color in the event (including Daniels's silver and Zoltán Halmay's gold in the 1904 yards-based event).\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nOne of the six finalists from 1912 returned: gold medalist Duke Kahanamoku of the United States. The favorites were Kahanamoku and fellow American Norman Ross, the 1919 Inter-Allied Games winner. Kahanamoku had broken the world record in 1918.\nBrazil, Czechoslovakia, Japan, Luxembourg, and Switzerland each made their debut in the event; Australia made its first appearance separate from New Zealand (the two had previously competed together as Australasia). The United States made its fifth appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date. Hungary missed the event for the first time, with the nation not invited to the Games after World War I.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was the same used in 1912; for each round before the final, the top two in each heat plus the fastest third-place swimmer would advance. There were 6 quarterfinals of between 4 and 7 swimmers, allowing 13 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 2 semifinals had 6 or 7 swimmers; 5 advanced to the final.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1920 Summer Olympics.\nIn the first heat Duke Kahanamoku set a new Olympic record with 1:01.8 minutes. In the semi-final he equalled the standing world record with 1:01.4 minutes. In the final which was later re-swum Kahanamoku set a new world record with 1:00.4 minutes, in the second final he equalled his record of 1:01.4 minutes again.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest two in each heat and the fastest third-placed from across the heats advanced.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest two in each semi-final and the faster of the two third-placed swimmer advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nIn the first final Norman Ross finished fourth and William Herald finished fifth, but a second final was run after a protest by Herald, claiming that Ross had fouled him. For the second run Ross was disqualified. None of the medal ranks changed."

        "title": "Alabama–Huntsville Chargers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Alabama–Huntsville Chargers ice hockey (commonly referred to as the UAH Chargers) were an NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represented the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The program was discontinued in 2021 due to funding issues and lack of conference membership.\nThe Chargers played their home games at Propst Arena at the Von Braun Center. In 1987, Alabama governor George Wallace declared Huntsville to be the \"Hockey Capital of the South\".\nHistory.\nFounding and club championships.\nDespite being a Southern city that might be considered unfamiliar with a winter sport such as hockey, Huntsville was, beginning in the 1950s, and still is to date, home to a large number of Northern-born (and possibly some Canadian) civilian professionals working in the aerospace and defense industries, and officers and enlisted people in the U.S. Army, who desired a taste of home in their sports allegiances. Even though a similar demographic in the Atlanta market failed to make an NHL team (the Flames) profitable in the 1970s (leading to its 1980 move to Calgary, Alberta), Huntsville proved to be a different case entirely in this regard. UAH, with which a fair number of the transplants had an institutional affiliation, was a convenient forum for their enthusiasm.\nThe UAH ice hockey program began as a club team in the late 1970s. Joe Ritch organized the inaugural Charger team in 1979, and served as head coach. UAH defeated Emory University 11-4 in its first game on October 26, 1979. UAH dominated opposition in its first three seasons, winning three Southern Collegiate Hockey Association championships. The Chargers won the first of their three National Club Hockey Championships in 1982, defeating Southern Methodist 14-2 in the title game.\nFor the 1982-83 season, Doug Ross became head coach as the Chargers moved to the Central States Collegiate Hockey League. UAH lost the conference championship game in overtime to Marquette, but the Chargers hosted the U.S. National Collegiate Club Hockey Championships, where they defeated Auburn (16-2), Arizona (7-4), and Penn State (5-4) en route to their second consecutive national championship.\nUAH hosted the club national championship tournament again in 1984, and the Chargers claimed a third straight title with wins over Miami University (3-1), Indiana (13-4), and Ohio (12-1). UAH hosted the tournament a third time in 1985, but its bid for a fourth straight championship fell short with a 6-2 loss to North Dakota State.\nVarsity and Division II championships.\nUAH elevated the hockey program to varsity status for the 1985-86 season as a member of the NAIA. The school became a full NCAA Division II member in 1986. With no NCAA sponsorship of hockey at the Division II level, UAH moved its program to Division I as an independent beginning with the 1987-88 season. The Chargers went 63-81-8 in their five seasons in Division I. UAH finished with a winning season twice in that span: 1988-89 (15-10-1) and the last season, 1991-92 (18-10-1).\nUAH returned to Division II hockey in 1992 with the NCAA resuming sponsorship of a national championship. In 1994, the Chargers hosted its first Division II national championship series, but lost to Bemidji State in overtime of a mini-game tiebreaker. After narrowly missing a chance at the title in 1995, the 1995-96 UAH team went undefeated (26-0-3) in the 1995-96 season and beat Bemidji State 7-1 and 3-0 at the Von Braun Center to claim its first NCAA championship in any sport. The Chargers traveled to Bemidji State for the 1997 finals, losing 4-2 and 3-2. The 1997-98 UAH team claimed its second Division II championship in 1998, beating Bemidji again 6-2 and 5-2 in Huntsville to finish 24-3-3.\nReturn to Division I and CHA era.\nUAH moved ice hockey back to Division I for the 1998-99 season as an independent, and the team became a charter member of College Hockey America starting with the 1999-2000 season. The Chargers won CHA regular season championships in 2001 and 2003.\nThe 2006-07 UAH team earned the school's first CHA tournament title and NCAA Division I tournament bid. The Chargers spotted Robert Morris a 4-0 first-period lead, but rallied to beat the Colonials 5-4 in overtime. At the Midwest Regional in Grand Rapids, Mich., UAH took No. 1 seed Notre Dame to double overtime before losing 3-2 in Doug Ross's final game as head coach before retiring.\nDanton Cole became UAH's third head coach in 2007.\nIn 2009, with the CHA's demise imminent following the announced departures of Niagara, Robert Morris, and Bemidji State, UAH applied for membership to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. The CCHA denied UAH's application on August 11.\nUAH won the final CHA tournament in 2010, beating Niagara 3-2 in overtime for its second berth in the Division I tournament. The Chargers lost to top-ranked Miami 2-1 at the Midwest Regional in Fort Wayne, Ind.\nIndependence and survival.\nCole left UAH in 2010 to become the head coach of the U.S. National Development Team. Assistant Chris Luongo was promoted to head coach as the Chargers became the lone independent program in Division I. The program struggled as an independent as scheduling and recruiting hurt without a championship to play for. UAH was a combined 6-54-3 in its first two independent seasons from 2010 to 2012.\nEarly into the 2011-12 season, interim UAH President Malcolm Portera announced that the 2011–12 season would be the school's final season competing at the NCAA Division I level, citing financial reasons. The program would be \"realigned\" as a club team, and the coaches' jobs would be eliminated. New UAH president Dr. Robert Altenkirch reversed the decision after he and school administrators met with local supporters on December 6, 2011. The school set up a campaign to raise funds for the program and have it join a conference.\nDespite the questions about its hockey future, UAH was the host institution for the 2012 Frozen Four in Tampa, Florida.\nA week before the start of the 2012-13 season, UAH replaced Luongo and hired Kurt Kleinendorst to become the program's fifth head coach.\nOn January 17, 2013, after months of discussions with conference officials and league member representatives, UAH formally applied to and was accepted to join the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The Chargers began conference play in the 2013-14 season.\nKleinendorst resigned on May 29, 2013. UAH named Mike Corbett as its sixth head hockey coach on July 8, 2013.\nDiscontinuation.\nIn response to the financial difficulties faced by the university as a result of COVID-19, UAH president Darren Dawson discontinued the men's hockey program, as well as the men's and women's tennis programs.\nOn May 25, 2020, the university announced the program would be reinstated if the community could raise $750,000 by Friday, May 29. Pledges from alumni reduced the amount needed from the general public to $500,000. On May 29, fundraising efforts surpassed $500,000, and shortly afterwards the university confirmed the program would be restored for the 2020-2021 season.\nThe program was once again indefinitely discontinued in May 2021 due to the team's lack of conference membership, which was a condition of a significant portion of the funds pledged the previous summer. The University stated it intends to reinstate the program once conference membership is secured.\nVarsity records.\nSince the 1985-86 season through the 2015-16 season.\nSeason.\nIndividual\nTeam\nGame.\nIndividual\nTeam"

        "title": "The Iowa Baseball Confederacy",
        "text": "\"The Iowa Baseball Confederacy\" is a 1986 novel written by Canadian author W.P. Kinsella. It is less well known than his novel \"Shoeless Joe\", which came to prominence when it was made into the film \"Field of Dreams.\" Like in \"Shoeless Joe\", baseball is at the heart of the novel, which uses \"magic realism\" to blend events and individuals past and present with the author's love of the game. However, it covers more themes than Shoeless Joe and it explores a greater number of plot lines.\nPlot.\nGideon Clarke has two obsessions, baseball and playing the trumpet. His life in the small town of Onamata in Iowa in 1978 is dominated by his desire to prove the existence of the Iowa Baseball Confederacy, a minor league 'active' in the early part of the 20th century, and to show the world that a team from this league played against the Chicago Cubs in 1908. Gideon has plenty of time to pursue his baseball obsession since his father (who was killed by being struck on the head by a ball at a baseball game) has left him in a financial position where he has no need to work. Unfortunately, there is no shred of evidence that the Confederacy ever existed or that the game against the Cubs took place. An almost subconscious knowledge of the events of 1908 shared by both Gideon and his father has been the root cause of their life long obsession as they strive, unsuccessfully' to validate what they believe to be the truth.\nGideon is married to Sunny, with whom he is deeply in love in spite of her habit of disappearing for long periods without an explanation other than her desire to be free. He accepts these periodic disappearances philosophically, and we learn of the parallel to his mother Maudie who was working in a traveling show when she met and married Gideon's father. In the book both Maudie and Gideon's sister have long departed the family home, and we find out that his sister is on the run as an urban guerrilla. Following his father's death, Gideon is informally adopted by his neighbors the Barons who also care for a Down Syndrome girl called Missy, for whom Gideon has a kind of brotherly affection. Gideon's best friend is called Stan; a minor league baseball player who dreams, in spite of the march of time that he can still make it in Major League Baseball.\nWhen Gideon discovers that his neighbor John Baron once played in the Confederacy, he becomes convinced that some sort of rift in time can take him back to 1908 and provide the ultimate proof of the game against the Cubs. He meets up with Stan on the site of the old baseball ground and they slip seamlessly into July 1908. Gideon passes himself off as a sports writer and he is adopted as the Confederacy Mascot. Stan is introduced as a baseball player and later becomes a member of the Confederacy team. The game against the Cubs starts normally enough, but instead of the professionals crushing the local farmhands, it becomes a titanic struggle between two well matched teams, neither of whom will give way. Accepting a draw is unacceptable to either side and so the game continues day after day, with the Cubs refusing to return to Chicago to fulfil their allotted major league fixtures. Along with the game itself Gideon encounters a mythical Indian figure named Drifting Away who was punished centuries ago by his grandfathers. It gradually becomes clear that the shadowy Drifting Away is influencing the game in favor of the Confederacy and that his own future is linked to the outcome. Gideon also meets and falls in love with Sarah, with her membership of the Twelve-Hour Church giving him scope for sneaking away to spend many nights of love making with her.\nAlthough the game starts normally enough it becomes increasingly surreal as it proceeds through its more than 2000 innings and weeks of play. Visitors to the game include the President of the US and Leonardo da Vinci. Players die or disappear and the later stages of the game are played in the pouring rain that increasingly threatens the town. The statue of the Black Angel from the local cemetery ends up playing in right field and batting .300. However, the more Gideon meets with Drifting Away, the more he realises that their paths are in conflict and he understands that his love affair with Sarah cannot end happily. The game is finally ended on Day 40 by Drifting Away striking a home run, with the town being simultaneously washed away. The next morning in the seemingly restored town Gideon witnesses Sarah become the first person in the county to be killed by a motor car. Gideon and Stan return to 1978, where Gideon realizes that Sunny is gone forever, and learns that John Baron is dead.\nThemes and Ideas.\nReaders must decide for themselves if the events of 1908 actually happened or if they were, as seems likely, merely a dream. Gideon is, of course, convinced that they were all real events. Apart from his obvious love of the game, the book explores some of W. P. Kinsella's favorite themes. While his lyrical writing about baseball is the core of the book, it is intertwined with the power of obsession, influence of dreams in shaping our destiny, the role of family, and the tragedy of love and loss."

        "title": "Maurice King (basketball)",
        "text": "Maurice E. King (December 1, 1934 – September 17, 2007) was an American professional basketball player who played for the NBA champion Boston Celtics in the 1959–60 season.\nEarly life.\nKing was born in Kansas City, Missouri and graduated from R. T. Coles High School in Kansas City, Missouri in 1953.\nKing led the R. T. Coles Jeeps to a Missouri state high school basketball championship in 1952 and a second-place finish in 1953.\nKing's stellar play earned him a basketball scholarship from the University of Kansas that commenced with the 1953–54 school year.\nKing was the second black basketball player to play at Kansas (and first black starter), following LaVannes Squires from Wichita East High School in Wichita, Kansas and preceding Wilt Chamberlain, who was the third.\nCollege career.\nAfter redshirting his first season at Kansas due to the freshmen eligibility rules in effect at the time, King played a reserve role in his sophomore season for the Kansas Jayhawks during the 1954–55 season in which Kansas finished with an 11–10 record and 5th place in the Big 7 Conference.\nEarning a starting position as a junior in 1955–56, King earned All-Big Seven honors for that season as KU's scoring leader averaging 14.0 points per game. The 1955–56 season, which Kansas finished with a 14–9 record and 5th place in the Big 7 Conference, was Wilt Chamberlain's freshman year in which Chamberlain was forced to redshirt due to NCAA rules in place at the time. As the only other black player on the Kansas team, King was a valuable friend and mentor to Chamberlain as they became fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha Psi, Mu Chapter.\nIn 1956–57, King's senior year, Chamberlain joined the Kansas Jayhawk varsity squad as a sophomore and led the team in scoring (29.6 points per game) and rebounding (18.8 rebounds per game). King remained a starter for the Jayhawks team and was a key contributor for the Jayhawks scoring 9.7 points per game.\nThe Jayhawks were ranked #1 or #2 in the Associated Press and U.P.I. polls the entire 1956–57 season, and advanced to the 1957 NCAA tournament as champion of the Big 7 Conference in its last season before it became the Big 8 Conference. The Jayhawks then defeated Southern Methodist University and Oklahoma City University in the Midwest Regional that was held at SMU Coliseum in Dallas, Texas to advance to the 1957 Final 4. King's stellar play landed him on the 1957 Midwest Regional all-tournament team.\nIn the 1957 Final 4, Kansas defeated University of San Francisco in the semi-final by the score of 80–56. The Jayhawks then lost to University of North Carolina by the score of 54–53 in triple overtime in the iconic 1957 NCAA title game at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. King was second on the Jayhawks behind Chamberlain in both scoring (11 points) and rebounds (5 rebounds) in the title game.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his senior season at Kansas, King was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 48th pick in the 6th round of the 1957 NBA draft. However, instead of joining the Celtics at that time, King served a two-year stint in the U.S. Army. Upon leaving the Army after his two-year commitment in 1959, King joined the Boston Celtics and played one game in the 1959–60 season. Later that season, the Celtics won the 1960 NBA title earning King an NBA championship recognition.\nImmediately after his stint with the Celtics during the 1959–60 season, King joined the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Professional Basketball League for the remainder of the season.\nOn August 2, 1960, the St. Louis Hawks signed King to a training camp contract. King played for the Hawks in the 1960 pre-season but did not play in any regular-season games in the 1960–61 NBA season.\nPrior to the 1961–62 season, King joined the fledgling Kansas City Steers of the American Basketball League (ABL).\nIn the ABL's inaugural season, King averaged 7.8 points per game, and led the team with an average of 3.2 assists. In Kansas City's second season in 1962–63, King averaged 14.7 points and 5.7 assists before the ABL folded on December 31, 1962.\nUpon the folding of the ABL, King immediately signed with the Chicago Zephyrs of the NBA, and played in 37 games in the 1962–63 NBA season, averaging 5.8 points and 3.8 assists.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter leaving the NBA after the 1963 season, King went on to a career with the Kansas City Kansas Public Schools. Later, King had a long career as a personnel manager for Hallmark Cards.\nAfter his playing career ended, King remained active as a supporter of the University of Kansas athletic program. He served on coaching search committees that hired football coach Mike Gottfried in 1982, basketball coach Larry Brown in 1983, athletic director Bob Frederick in 1987, football coach Glen Mason in 1987, and basketball coach Roy Williams in 1988.\nKing also served on the Jackson County, Missouri Parks and Recreation Advisory Board.\nPersonal life.\nKing had four children: Yasmin Brown, Calvin Wainright, Maurice King III, and Kimberly King-Crawford. Two of King's grandsons, Ish Wainright and Amaad Wainright, also played college basketball.\nDuring his career at Baylor, Ish Wainright played in four NCAA tournaments, including advancing to the Sweet Sixteen in 2014 and 2017. In one game he played for Baylor against Kansas, he honored his father's legacy by having his name be called Ishmail King-Wainright instead of just Ishmail Wainright. Wainright also played college football for one season in Baylor as a tight end, to the point where he once joined the Buffalo Bills of the NFL under their training camp roster after graduating from Baylor. Ishmail currently plays for the Phoenix Suns, previously under a two-way contract throughout the 2021–22 season before getting a full-time contract with them in 2022 and then being on another two-way contract for the 2022–23 season before getting a two-year contract in 2023. He has also played for the Uganda men's national basketball team for events like the FIBA AfroBasket 2021.\nAmaad Wainright previously played college basketball for Trinity Valley Community College before transferring to Kansas State University starting in their 2017–18 season. During that specific season, Wainright and Kansas State made it to the 2018 NCAA tournament, going as far as the Elite 8 in their tournament run that season. However, he transferred out of Kansas State the following season, joining the LSU–Shreveport Pilots basketball team for his final two years in college."

        "title": "Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball",
        "text": "The Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball program represents the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio. The school's team competes in NCAA Division I as part of the Big 12 Conference. The Bearcats are currently coached by Wes Miller.\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are the 12th winningest basketball program of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati had an all-time tournament record of 46–32. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 36 have gone on to play in the NBA.\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at Fifth Third Arena, which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. Cincinnati joined the original Big East Conference in 2005, which was rebranded as the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in 2013. In 2023, they joined the Big 12 conference.\nBy the numbers.\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2021–22 season):\nHistory.\n1901-1940s – The beginning.\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to Yale but later defeated a team from the University of Kentucky while compiling a 5–4 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the Buckeye Athletic Association and the Mid-American Conference.\n1954–1958 – The start of something special.\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, Armory Fieldhouse, with a 97–65 win over Indiana in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was Jack Twyman, who earned All-America status in 1954–55. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nOscar Robertson made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport—college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the Missouri Valley Conference by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to Kansas State in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n1958–1964 – A run unlike any other.\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958–59 and 1959–60, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach (Ed Jucker) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960–61. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961–62. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962–63, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when the Loyola Ramblers overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60–58, in overtime.\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161–16 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. Connie Dierking (1958), Ralph Davis (1960), Bob Wiesenhahn (1961), Paul Hogue (1961, 1962), Tom Thacker (1963), Tony Yates (1963), Ron Bonham (1963, 1964) and George Wilson (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n1970s – Continued success.\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170–85 record (.667). The success was led by flashy-dressing head coach Gale Catlett, who led the Bearcats to the NCAA tournament in the 1974–75 season returning Cincinnati to the Big Dance for the first time since the 1965–66 season. Cincinnati inaugurated the Metro Conference by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974 to 1977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. Catlett was also a skilled recruiter, bringing Jim Ard (1970), Lloyd Batts (1973), Steve Collier (1976), Gary Yoder (1977), Bob Miller (1978) and Pat Cummings (1979) to Cincinnati who all earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\nAfter the 1977–78 campaign Catlett would leave to coach his alma mater West Virginia and Cincinnati hired Chicago Bulls head coach Ed Badger. A month into Badger's first season, the Bearcats were banned from postseason play and live television for two years due to numerous violations under Catlett, including recruiting violations and impermissible benefits. Badger would have only two winning seasons during his tenure, and resigned after the 1983 season.\n1980–1988 – Down in the dumps.\nTony Yates, a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, succeeded Badger as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983–84, UC went 3–25 (0–14 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1–9 in 1915. After tallying only two more winning seasons, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 NIT. All told, the 1980s were an especially hard time for the Bearcats, who went 112–142 over the course of the decade and notched only two winning seasons.\n1989–2005 – Back into the national spotlight.\nBob Huggins, the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989–90 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five]\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992–2004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992–2005).\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, Danny Fortson, Kenyon Martin and Steve Logan, picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, Nick Van Exel, Ruben Patterson, Bobby Brannen, Melvin Levett, Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996–97 after receiving second team recognition in 1995–96. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999–2000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001–02 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president Nancy Zimpher in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for DUI in 2004. This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach Andy Kennedy as interim head coach for the 2005–06 season.\n2006–2009 – Resurrecting a gutted program.\nIn the spring of 2006, Mick Cronin was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach Andy Kennedy after the dismissal of Bob Huggins. Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker Connor Barwin.\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008–09 season with an 18–14 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009–10 campaign.\n2010–2019 – Return to winning ways.\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight consecutive NCAA Tournaments, along with Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas, Michigan State and North Carolina. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018–19 season.\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17 against San Diego State. Assistant Coach, Larry Davis took the reins and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over Purdue in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2013–14 season and 2017–18 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons Cincinnati won the American Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as Sean Kilpatrick, Troy Caupain, Jacob Evans, and Gary Clark. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and Jarron Cumberland.\n2020–present – Coaching shakeups.\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the UCLA Bruins after UCLA had fired Coach Steve Alford earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the Bearcats). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that John Brannen was being hired as the new head coach.\nIn his first year, Brannen would lead the 'Cats to a share of the regular season AAC championship before both the AAC tournament and the NCAA tournament were cancelled due to COVID-19. In Brannen's second season, the team struggled to find its footing and dealt with 5 COVID related opt-outs and a 25 day program pause. The Bearcats would finish 12—11 but enjoyed a surprising run in the 2021 AAC tournament before losing in the final.\nOn March 26, Athletic Director John Cunningham announced the university would begin investigating allegations against the program. Soon after on April 3, it was announced that head coach John Brannen was placed on indefinite leave. Finally, on April 9 the school announced Brannen had been relieved of his duties effective immediately along with assistants.\nOn April 14 Cincinnati hired Wes Miller to become their next head coach, replacing Brannen.\nNotable games.\n01/09/1958 – Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54: 19-year-old sophomore Oscar Robertson (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win. His 56 points, at the time, was a Madison Square Garden record.\n03/25/1961 – Cincinnati 70, Ohio State 65: The Buckeyes were the defending champs, 27–0 and No. 1 in the nation. They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's Bobby Knight sent the game into overtime, tied at 61. Cincy, led by Paul Hogue and Bob Wiesenhahn, took it from there, winning, 70–65, giving the Bearcats their first basketball title in school history.\n03/24/1962 – Cincinnati 71, Ohio State 59: Cincinnati and Ohio State, again ranked Nos. 1 and 2 at the end of the regular season, became the first teams to play each other in two consecutive NCAA championship games. Unlike the year before, this game was not close. Cincy led by eight at the half and won by 12 as Paul Hogue and Tom Thacker led the way with 22 and 21 points, respectively. When it was over, the Bearcats' second-year coach Ed Jucker had a pair of NCAA titles in two tries.\n03/23/1963 – Loyola Chicago 60, Cincinnati 58: Despite its No. 3 ranking and a scoring average of 91.8, nobody expected Loyola of Chicago to beat Cincinnati, especially when the Ramblers fell behind by 15 in the second half. But Loyola rallied to send the game into OT and won the title on a last-second rebound and basket by Vic Rouse.\n3/13/1976 – Notre Dame 79, Cincinnati 78: Facing No. 7 Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament, the No. 15 Bearcats had led the entire game and were inbounding under the Irish basket with eight seconds left. The Bearcats were called for a five-second violation, in part for their signal for a timeout being missed by the official. Notre Dame would get the ball and score with two seconds remaining to escape with the victory.\n12/21/1981 – Cincinnati 75, Bradley 73: This contest is still listed as the longest game of NCAA Division I history, reaching seven overtimes. Reserve forward Doug Schloemer hit the decisive shot, a left-wing 15-footer with one second remaining in the seventh overtime. If he had missed that jump shot, it would have gone to an eighth overtime.\n12/12/1983 – Kentucky 24, Cincinnati 11: It what became known as the \"stall game\", first year coach Tony Yates had his players go into a four-corner spread and waste the clock. Trying to limit the pain from the No. 2 Wildcats, boos rang out for most of the game and Kentucky refused to reschedule a series with Cincinnati after the end of the contract. This game was a big factor that lead to the introduction of the shot clock for the 1985–86 season.\n12/12/1984 – Cincinnati 69, UAB 67: No. 17 UAB had a one-point lead, but in the waning seconds, Tony Wilson, who was on a track scholarship, hit a 54-foot shot beyond half-court at the buzzer to give Cincinnati a 2-point win at Riverfront Coliseum.\n11/25/1989 – Cincinnati 66, Minnesota 64: It was the school's first game under Bob Huggins, in their new arena, the Shoemaker Center. Walk-on Steve Sanders, who was also the school's football team's wide receiver for four years, hit the buzzer-beating three-pointer to give UC a 66–64 win over No. 20 Minnesota.\n01/23/1993 – Cincinnati 40, UAB 38: The No. 9 Bearcats were heavily favored playing at home vs an 11–7 UAB team. It was an ugly, very low-scoring affair, where UAB led at halftime 15–11. In a tie game with seconds left, Corie Blount for UC had his shot blocked. It was kicked around and Nick Van Exel recovered it to put up a long two-pointer at the buzzer. Nothing but net. Cats won 40–38.\n12/17/1994 – Cincinnati 81, Wyoming 80: UC trailed Wyoming all game, but when down 2 in the final seconds, LaZelle Durden put up a 3-point attempt as the final horn sounded. He was fouled, but hit all three free throws with no time on the clock. UC won, 81–80, and Durden's 45 points were the most by a Bearcat in 34 years.\n03/12/1995 – Cincinnati 67, St. Louis 65: LaZelle Durden fired in the game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds to play in the conference championship game over Saint Louis, giving the Bearcats a 67–65 victory and clinching an NCAA Tournament berth.\n02/11/1996 – Arizona, 79, Cincinnati 76: The Bearcats had the ball under their own hoop in a tie game vs Arizona with just a few seconds left. Miles Simon stripped the ball from Danny Fortson, and hit a three-quarter-court buzzer-beater to beat UC, 79–76.\n02/06/1997 – Cincinnati 65, Tulane 64: The game was tied at 63 with 2 seconds left, and UC had the ball. Bobby Brannan threw the ball the length of the court. Danny Fortson made the catch near the hoop and laid it in with 0.2 seconds remaining. The majority of the Bearcats bench stormed the court in excitement, thinking the game was over. Cincinnati was given a technical foul for the incident, awarding Tulane two free throws and the ball. Honeycutt only made one of two free throws, and Tulane was unable to score with 0.2 seconds left. Cincinnati won by one.\n02/19/1998 – Cincinnati 93, UAB 76: All-American Ruben Patterson was awoken at 6:00 in the morning by Bob Huggins. The coach broke the news to him that his mother had a heart attack overnight and died. Patterson played the game that night anyway, after spending all day crying. He scored a career-high 32 points in a 93–76 win over UAB.\n03/15/1998 – West Virginia 75, Cincinnati 74: Cincinnati took a 2-point lead with 7.1 seconds remaining against West Virginia in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Jarrod West of WV then banked in a 30-foot three-pointer with 0.8 seconds left, a shot that was tipped by Ruben Patterson. West Virginia advanced to the Sweet Sixteen with a 75–74 win.\n11/29/1998 – Cincinnati 77, Duke 75: No. 14 Cincinnati took on No. 1 Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout championship. In a tie game with 3 seconds left, Cincinnati ran a \"hook-and-ladder\" type play, that had Kenyon Martin hit an open Melvin Levett sprinting towards the hoop. Levett dunked the ball with one second left, and the Bearcats won, 77–75. As of the 2019 season, it is their lone win vs a No. 1 team.\n03/02/2000 – Cincinnati 66, DePaul 64: DePaul led the No. 2 Bearcats by 17, and by 10 with under 4 minutes remaining. The National POY Kenyon Martin took over, scoring 5 straight field goals for UC and had 2 key blocks down the stretch. With the game tied at 62, freshman DerMarr Johnson hit the game-winning jumper with 2.7 seconds left.\n02/22/2002 – Cincinnati 63, Marquette 62: 9th-ranked Marquette led No. 4 Cincinnati by 4 with 30 seconds remaining. Steve Logan hit a three-pointer with 22 seconds left, then after a missed one-and-one free throw by Dwyane Wade, Donald Little hit a jumper with 3 seconds remaining. Cincinnati won 63–62 in their biggest win of the season.\n03/08/2006 – Syracuse 74, Cincinnati 73: In the first round of the Big East tournament, the Bearcats led by one with 8.3 seconds remaining. Devan Downey of UC was at the line shooting two free throws. After making the first, he missed the second. Trailing by 2, Gerry McNamara of Syracuse came down and hit a running one-handed three pointer with 0.5 seconds left, giving Syracuse a one-point win. Cincinnati, who was a bubble team, just barely missed the NCAA tournament (even with a Joe Lunardi prediction of a 9 seed on the morning of Selection Sunday), snapping their streak of 14 straight appearances.\n3/11/2010 – West Virginia 54, Cincinnati 51: The Bearcats needed a marquee win to shore up a borderline NCAA tournament at-large profile and they would get the opportunity against #6 West Virginia and their former Coach Bob Huggins in the Big East Quarterfinals. With the score tied, the Bearcats were able to force WVU into a shot clock violation with 6.4 seconds left, giving them the final possession from under the opposing team's baseline. Captain Deonta Vaughn would inbounds to sophomore Dion Dixon, who the Mountaineers were able to overwhelm near halfcourt - causing him to dribble the ball off his leg and out of bounds. On the ensuing possession, tournament MVP Da'Sean Butler would receive the ball with 3.1 seconds left and unleash a highly contested 3 pointer which banked in and sent West Virginia to their eventual Big East tournament championship and the Bearcats to the NIT.\n12/10/2011 – Xavier 76, Cincinnati 53: The 2011 rivalry game with Xavier ended in a bench-clearing brawl between the two teams, with the officials calling an end to the game with less than 10 seconds left. For more details, see 2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl.\n03/09/2012 – Cincinnati 71, Syracuse 68: Unranked Cincinnati took on No. 2 Syracuse (31–1) in the Big East tournament semifinals. The Bearcats were hot out of the gate, hitting 8 of their first 10 three-point attempts and jumping out to a 25–8 lead. Syracuse came roaring back in the game, getting it to a one-point game with a few seconds left. A Justin Jackson dunk with a second remaining capped the Bearcats 71–68 win, the school's highest-ranked victory since 1998.\n03/19/2015 – Cincinnati 66, Purdue 65: 8-seeded Cincinnati and 9-seeded Purdue met for the first time in the NCAA tournament in this round of 64 matchup. In a game that was close the majority of the way, Purdue began to pull away down the stretch. Down 7 with 48 seconds to go, the Bearcats hit a three pointer, forced a turnover, and made an and-one layup, all within 6 seconds to cut it to one. Down two with 7 seconds left, sophomore Troy Caupain drove to the hoop and hit a floater that dramatically spun around the rim, hung on the rim for a second, and fell in, as time expired. In overtime, UC prevailed 66–65, to advance to the round of 32 against an undefeated Kentucky team.\n03/11/2016 – UConn 104, Cincinnati 97: In a 4-overtime thriller for the ages, Cincinnati and UConn faced off in the AAC Tournament. In the closing seconds of the 3rd overtime, in a tie game, UC guard Kevin Johnson drained a long 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to take a three-point lead. In a desperation heave, Jalen Adams of UConn banked in a 75-footer to extend the game. UConn outscored Cincinnati in the 4th overtime, 16–9, advancing in the conference tournament in which they would end up winning.\n03/18/2016 – St. Joe's 78, Cincinnati 76: In the first round of the NCAA tournament, 9-seeded Cincinnati took on 8-seeded St. Joe's. After the Cats clawed back from a second half deficit of 12 points, St. Joe's drained a 3-pointer with under 10 seconds left to take a two-point lead. Cincy guard Troy Caupain drove the length of the floor to the hoop, and got the ball to Octavius Ellis after being swarmed by a double-team. Ellis attempted to quickly slam it home, only to discover his dunk was 0.1 seconds too late. Time expired. St. Joe's advanced.\n03/04/2018 – Cincinnati 62, Wichita State 61 : The 10th ranked Bearcats met the 11th ranked Shockers at their home arena on senior night - facing a team that regularly played six seniors - for a chance to win the American Athletic Conference regular season championship outright. In a modern classic under the gaze of a hostile sellout crowd, both squads went back and forth throughout the matchup. Down 1 with 9.3 seconds left under their own basket, Wichita State whipped it around to senior three point ace: Conner Frankamp. UC anticipated the mismatch with sophomore Center Nysier Brooks on the perimeter. Frankamp's potential game-winner missed wide with State corralling the offensive rebound; however, fellow UC sophomore Jarron Cumberland laid down some suffocating defense under the basket, causing their putback to miss off the backside of the backboard as time expired. This gave UC its second regular season AAC title and first outright.\n03/11/2018 – Cincinnati 56, Houston 55 : Cincinnati met the nationally ranked Houston Cougars for the third time this season, having split the regular season 1-1. The rubber match came in the finals of the American Athletic Conference tournament, with both schools seeking their first ever AAC tournament title. Gary Clark and company were able to cut down the nets for the first time in their collegiate careers, as Houston's star Rob Gray turned the ball over on the game's final possession.\n03/18/2018 – Nevada 75, Cincinnati 73: With the \"South bracket\" in the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament shaping up in Cincinnati's favor, the Bearcats seemed prime for continued March success as they led Nevada by 22 points with 11 minutes remaining. Nevada mounted a furious comeback, scoring 16 straight points over the next 3 minutes. The game continued to be touch and go for the remainder of the half, with an overwhelming amount of foul calls against the Bearcats. With 9 seconds left, Nevada took their first and only lead of the game at 75–73. The Bearcats dribbled the full length of the court but bobbled the ball and never got a clean look as time expired and Nevada tied the second largest comeback to-date in NCAA Tournament history.\n03/17/2019 - Cincinnati 69, Houston 57: After being beaten twice by the Cougars in 2019 - the second an embarrassing 85–69 home loss on Senior Day a week earlier that cost them a share of the AAC regular season crown - the Bearcats got a third shot at the outright AAC regular season champs, but were thought to be heavy underdogs against the 31-2 Cougars. After defeating SMU (82-74) and Wichita State (66-63) in the AAC quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, the Bearcats scored a redemptive victory. AAC Player of the year Jarron Cumberland scored 33 points and was named tournament most outstanding player as the Bearcats successfully defended their AAC Tournament Crown and delivered Houston's only double digit loss of the 2018-2019 season.\n03/07/2020 - Cincinnati 64, Temple 63: The Bearcats under new coach John Brannen endured an up and down season - epitomized by a Senior Day where they fell behind underdog Temple by as many as 14 points. Fueled by All-AAC players Jarron Cumberland and Trevon Scott, the Bearcats slowly mounted a comeback - tying the game at 54 with 2:03 left. After a hectic 2 minutes, Temple took the lead on a late 3 with 10 seconds remaining. Out of timeouts, Jarron Cumberland drove down the court but his layup ricocheted off the back iron; however, Trevon Scott heroically made a putback layup in the waning seconds to give the Bearcats a dramatic win. The win ultimately shored up the Bearcats' bubbly tournament resume and gave the Bearcats a share of the AAC regular season title.\nRivalries.\nXavier.\nCincinnati's main basketball rivalry is Xavier University. The two schools play annually in the Skyline Chili Crosstown Shootout. Cincinnati's record in the Shootout is 51–39. However, Cincinnati has lost five consecutive matchups against Xavier.\nLouisville.\nUC and Louisville were rivals, first playing in 1921, until the 2010–13 NCAA conference realignment put the contest on hiatus, as Louisville moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference on July 1, 2014. The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference to Conference USA, and more recently in the Big East Conference, which in 2013 was renamed to the American Athletic Conference. The teams have faced off 99 times in series history, with Louisville leading the all-time series 53–43. Most notably, Louisville and Cincinnati faced each other twice over the course of the 2011-12 season. UC would upset then No. 17 ranked Louisville at home before facing off again in the 2012 Big East men's basketball tournament championship game, where Louisville would prevail 50–44.\nMemphis.\nFirst playing in 1968, Cincinnati and Memphis have been longtime conference rivals from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference, Great Midwest Conference, Conference USA, and currently in the American Athletic Conference though Cincinnati is scheduled to leave for the Big 12 Conference in 2023. The teams have faced off 86 times in basketball series history, with Cincinnati leading the all-time series 47–38.\nFamously, Cincinnati beat Penny Hardaway's Tigers four times in the 1991–92 season, including in the Elite Eight on the way to the program's sixth Final Four appearance.\nOther rivals.\nUC and Dayton have faced off 91 times, with UC leading the all-time series 60–31.

        "text": "The \"DEL\", \"2nd Bundesliga\" and \"Oberliga\" are the first three levels of ice hockey in Germany. All three leagues operate nationwide. While the \"DEL\" is an independently operated league, the other two are run by the German ice hockey federation, the \"DEB\", through the \"ESBG\". The leagues below the \"Oberliga\" are operated by the state federations (German:\"Landesverbände\") and don't run nationwide. The 2007–08 season for the three top leagues started on 6 September 2007 with the first round in the \"DEL\" and finished on 25 April 2008 with the fifth and last game of the \"2nd Bundesliga\" finals.\nDeutsche Eishockey Liga, the \"DEL\".\nThe \"DEL\" is the highest tier of German ice hockey. The league was played with 15 clubs in the 2007–08 season, one more than the previous season, because the 2006–07 \"2nd Bundesliga\" champion EHC Wolfsburg Grizzly Adams had joined the league. The modus however remained the same. Each club played the others four times, resulting in 56 regular season games per club. The top six clubs at the end of the regular season qualified for the first round of the play-offs. The clubs seven to ten played a preliminary round to determine the last two places for the first round. For the teams placed eleven to fifteen, the season has ended. No club was relegated from the \"DEL\" this season. The league will however expand and admit a sixteenth team for next season.\nThe league was won, for a third time in four years, by the \"Eisbären Berlin\".\nFinal table.\nThe final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime or penalties, one for a loss after overtime or penalties and no points for an outright loss.\nPlay-offs.\nThe four rounds of the 2007–08 play-offs were played under the following system:\nUnlike the regular season, in the play-offs games will not be decided by penalty shoot-outs but in overtime (OT) sudden-death. In all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6).\nTop Scorers.\nThe five highest placed scores in the regular season and play-offs are:\n2nd Bundesliga.\nThe \"2nd Bundesliga\" is the second highest tier of ice hockey in Germany. The league played with 14 clubs in the 2007–08 season, the same number it had since 2001. Each club played each other four times during the regular season. The top eight teams in the league qualified for the play-offs to determined the \"2nd Bundesliga\" champion who also has the opportunity to gain promotion to the \"DEL\" this season. For the clubs placed nine and ten, the season has finished after the regular round. The bottom four clubs play out the two relegated teams from the \"2nd Bundesliga\". However, due to the later insolvency of two of the league's teams, only one club, the \"EV Landsberg\", was relegated.\nThe league was won by the \"Kassel Huskies\" who thereby earned the right to apply for a \"DEL\" licence and return to the league they played in until 2006.\nThe \"Moskitos Essen\" and \"Eisbären Regensburg\" both declared insolvency on 15 April 2008, being unable to meet their debts. Both clubs are immediately relegated from the \"2nd Bundesliga\". The two relegated clubs, \"Lausitz\" and \"Landsberg\", are the first replacement for the two. The \"EV Landsberg\" is in financial trouble themselves and will probably not take part in the next \"2nd Bundesliga\" season, therefore the \"Wölfe Freiburg\" become the next replacement as best-placed semifinal loser from the \"Oberliga\". Should \"Regensburg\" be able to survive the insolvency, the team could enter in the \"Oberliga\" for the 2008–09 season, this is however seen as unlikely by the club. If not it will take up the place of its reserve team in the Bavarian \"Landesliga\" (Tier V). Which league the \"Moskitos Essen\" will be playing in 2008–09 is not yet clear but it will not be the \"2nd Bundesliga\". Like \"Regensburg\", the team could take the place of the reserve side which won promotion to the \"Regionalliga\" (Tier IV) this season.\nDue to the structure of the \"2nd Bundesliga\", where all teams playing are separate companies operated by the mother club, the insolvency of one of those does not mean the club itself becomes insolvent. Reserve teams are usually operated by the mother club and therefore unaffected by any insolvencies.\nRegular season.\nThe final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime, one for a loss after overtime and no points for an outright loss.\nPlay-offs.\nThe three rounds of the 2007–08 play-offs were played under the following system:\nIn all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6). Should a game be undecided after regular time, there will be one overtime (OT) in sudden death format. Should there still be no winner, the game is decided through penalties (P).\nPlay-downs.\nThe play downs consists of only one round, played in a best-of-seven format. The two loser of this round are nominally relegated to the \"Oberliga\".\nOberliga.\nThe \"Oberliga\" is the third tier of ice hockey in Germany and as such the lowest nationwide level; below it are currently the \"LEV's\" (\"Landesverbände\"). In the 2007–08 season the league played with 19 clubs. For the first time since 2001, the \"Oberliga\" was split into a northern and a southern group. Unlike until 2001 however, when the top teams of the two divisions only met in the finals, games between the two groups are already staged in the regular season, when teams from the same division met each other four times while teams from opposite divisions only met twice.\nThe first four clubs in each group qualified for the \"Oberliga\" play-offs to determine the two promoted clubs to the \"2nd Bundesliga\". An \"Oberliga\" final is not played as the two semifinal winners are both promoted. The regular season results between the two semifinal winners determined the \"Oberliga\" champion instead. The two fifth-placed teams and the sixth from the south finished their season with the end of the regular season. The bottom four clubs of each division played out one relegated team each, independently of each other. In turn, the three regional champions will gain promotion to the \"Oberliga\" with the possibility of more clubs moving up should the \"DEL\", as planned, expand or a club in the top three divisions fold or withdraw.\nThe league was won by the \"Dresdner Eislöwen\" who are, together with the runner-up \"Tölzer Löwen\", promoted to the \"2nd Bundesliga\". Due to \"Kassel\" gaining entry to the \"DEL\", the \"Wölfe Freiburg\" were also promoted. Of the bottom two clubs, only \"Erfurt\" was relegated. \"Weiden\" withdrew from the league for financial reasons.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season saw the league split into two groups, the \"Oberliga Nord\" and \"Oberliga Süd\", a separation which had existed until the 2000–01 season.\nPlay-offs.\nThe \"Oberliga\" play-offs are operating on a best-of-seven modus. The winning teams of the semifinals are promoted to the \"2nd Bundesliga\". Should the \"DEL\" expand to 16 teams, the best placed club of the two semifinal losers will also gain entry to the \"2nd Bundesliga\".\nSemi finals.\nWinners promoted to \"2nd Bundesliga\".\nPlay-downs.\nThe \"Oberliga\" play-downs are also operating on a best-of-seven modus. The two groups determine separately one relegated team each, this being the losing teams of the second round.\nSecond round.\nLosing teams relegated to the \"LEV's\".\nLeagues below the \"Oberliga\".\nThe levels below the \"Oberliga\" are not administrated by the \"DEB\" but rather by the local federations, the \"LEV's\". With the \"ESBG's\" intention to increase the number of clubs in the \"Oberliga\" from 19 to 20 to balance both leagues, three promotion places will be available from the \"LEV's\" to this league in 2007–08. Should the \"DEL\" expand as well, another promotion spot would become available and it is planned to hand this one to the \"Regionalliga West\". Only the three regional champions had the right for promotion but all clubs but the \"Herner EV\" declined:\nRegionalliga West.\nThe \"Regionalliga West\" is actually not quite a league but rather a promotion round. It contains the best six teams of the \"Regionalliga Nordrhein-Westfalen\", and the top two teams of the \"Regionalliga Hessen\" and the \"Baden-Württemberg Liga\" each. The winner of this league is promoted to the \"Oberliga\" but this seasons runner-up, the \"EHC Dortmund\" may gain promotion to. As such, the league covers the German states of Baden-Württemberg, Hessen, Saarland, Rheinland-Pfalz and Nordrhein-Westfalen.\nRegionalliga Nordost.\nThis league covers the north and north east of Germany. Again, it is more of a promotion round, compromising ten teams from two groups, the northern and the north eastern group. The \"Regionalliga Nordost\" covers the German states of Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, Sachsen-Anhalt, Sachsen and Thüringen.\nBayernliga.\nThe \"Bayernliga\" is the only single-state league of the three, covering just Bavaria. The reason for this is that the state holds approximately one third of all ice hockey clubs in Germany and 18 of the 48 clubs in the first three divisions are from this federation."

        "text": "David Ivor Walter Hilton (born 3 April 1970) is a former professional rugby union player who played as a prop. Although he was born in England, he qualified to play for the Scotland national team by virtue of a grandfather who he believed was born in Scotland; however, it later emerged that his grandfather's birth was registered in England. Despite this, Hilton completed a residency period to restore his Scottish eligibility, and he went on to win a total of 42 caps in a seven-year international career. At club level, he played for Bath, Glasgow and Bristol.\nCareer.\nProfessional career.\nDuring his club career, Hilton won the Heineken Cup for Bath in 1998, as well as league and domestic cup successes for the same club.\nHe left Bath and played for Glasgow in the Welsh-Scottish League and then the Celtic League.\nAfter being capped for Scotland on residency criteria he continued to play for Glasgow until 2003 before then returning to England to play for Bristol, until his retirement in 2008.\nInternational career.\nHilton won his first cap for Scotland against Canada on 21 January 1991 and his 42nd and final cap against South Africa on 16 November 2002. Hilton originally believed he qualified for Scotland as his grandfather was born there.\nHowever, in 2000 - and after 41 caps for Scotland - Hilton discovered his grandfather's birth was registered in Bristol and not Edinburgh as he believed. Hilton claimed that his grandfather was born 16 weeks before the Bristol registration but he could not prove whether or not his grandfather was born in Scotland. Without adequate documentation he did not qualify to play for Scotland under the international eligibility rules.\nAt around the same time it was discovered that Welsh internationals Shane Howarth and Brett Sinkinson were ineligible to play for Wales under the grandparent rules. The resulting scandal encompassing Hilton and the others was named Grannygate and was embarrassing for the players and rugby unions alike. However both the SRU and the WRU escaped without punishment. As part of a subsequent TV investigation, Hilton's great-grandfather was traced to Glasgow giving credence to Hilton's Scottish ancestry.\nHilton had already moved from Bath to Glasgow to play for Glasgow Caledonians, later renamed Glasgow Rugby, a year before the scandal broke so he had already a period of residence in Scotland. He had then to complete another two years in order to qualify again for Scotland under the three-year residency rule. After that period of residency Hilton played once more for Scotland in a victory over South Africa in 2002.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2012 Hilton joined Moseley as forwards coach and occasional replacement prop, having previously been coach at Dings Crusaders. Hilton also coaches Clifton RFC Under-14s, who in the 2016/17 season won the Gloucester County Cup, the Nando's Cup, the Bristol Combination 7s Cup and were finalists in the Bristol Combination Cup. Clifton later went on to win the Bristol Combination cup as well as another Nando's Cup and three more Bristol combination 7s cups.\nHilton now coaches Bristol Bears Women in the Tyrell's Premier 15s completion."

        "text": "Putney Town Rowing Club (PTRC) is a rowing club on the Tideway, the tidal reach of the River Thames in England. Its official British Rowing registered colours are navy and white.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded at the Half Moon Hotel, Putney in 1922 where it decided to base itself underneath The Duke's Head pub in Putney.\nSince 1986 PTRC has occupied a boathouse in Kew. This allowed the club to expand, but its one-storey building was burnt down in 1992 by arson. The current boathouse was purpose-built in 1995 to create a large hall, bar, meeting room, changing areas and racking for a large number of boats, inside and outside.\nOn 26 October 2005, Putney Town had celebrated 10 years of the new boathouse with \"Phoenix Party\", where the entire fleet was taken out and rowed past the clubhouse, in front of a number of old members and local dignitaries.\nEquipment and facilities.\nThe club house is at Townmead Road, Kew, just upstream of Chiswick Bridge on the southern (Surrey) bank of the river. The ground floor consists of a boatshed and a weight lifting area. The first floor has a large gym, bar, kitchen and changing rooms.\nThere are launches for coaching crews, a fully equipped weights area and Concept 2 ergometers. The large hall also allows the running of circuit training sessions, stretching and fitness classes as desired.\nMembers.\nThe club is for members only, but anyone may join under the following categories: Senior, Junior, Cox, Veteran or Land (Non Rowing). Members compete at a number of events, from local tideway regattas and head races, multi-lane national races and including Henley Royal Regatta (HRR), Henley Women's Regatta, the Vets Head of the River Race and a number of other local and national regattas.\nThe club has links with local schools such as Shene School and Christ's School with the ARA's 'Project Oarsome' initiative. The London Oratory School have also used the Putney Town boathouse in the past.\nResults.\nNon-local regatta accolades include that in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 the club's men's eight qualified for the Thames Challenge Cup for men's eights at Henley Royal Regatta, on each occasion knocked out of the heavily competed tournament on the first full day of racing. The qualification for the event in 2007 was the first time the club qualified into the event for 40 years. The Wyfold Challenge Cup saw the (coxless) four also qualify in 2010.\nMulti-lane (i.e. 6-8 lane) rowing has expanded. The first such win for a club crew was at Wallingford Regatta annually held at Eton-Dorney, in the Senior 3 Coxed Four, in 2008. The men's squad have competed in a number of events, including the Head of the Charles in Boston, MA and annually at all the major Tideway heads.\nThe women's senior squad has excelled at nationally attended eights races, at Henley Women's Regatta in 2008, the intermediate eight reached the semi-final of the Invesco Perpetual Trophy. See below for the 2014 pennant and medals won at the women's eights head of the river race.\nAt other national competitions:"

        "title": "1995 PPG Indy Car World Series",
        "text": "The 1995 PPG Indy Car World Series season was the seventeenth in the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) era of U.S. American open-wheel car racing. It consisted of 17 races, beginning in Miami, Florida on March 5 and concluding in Monterey, California on September 10. The PPG Indy Car World Series Drivers' Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Jacques Villeneuve. Rookie of the Year was Gil de Ferran. This was the last season before the formation of the Indy Racing League by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner, Tony George, and the last time the United States Auto Club-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 would appear in the Series.\n1994 IndyCar Rookie of the Year Jacques Villeneuve won the season opener at Miami, a foreshadowing of things to come for the French-Canadian driver. After Scott Goodyear was penalized, Villeneuve won the 1995 Indianapolis 500 despite also receiving a penalty in the race that put Villeneuve down two laps. Villeneuve also won at Road America and Cleveland en route to the 1995 IndyCar Championship and an offer from Frank Williams to drive in Formula One in 1996. Though Team Penske scored five wins (four by 1994 IndyCar champion Al Unser Jr.), they were nowhere near the juggernaut that they were in 1994, with a low point being that both team drivers (Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi) failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. The Honda engine that was abandoned at Indianapolis the previous year led most of the Indy 500 in 1995. The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company returned to the series and Indianapolis for the first time since 1974. Danny Sullivan's racing career came to an end after a hard crash at Michigan International Speedway.\nTeams and drivers.\nSeveral teams went through complete overhauls during the 1994 offseason. At Newman-Haas Racing, Nigel Mansell left IndyCar and returned to Formula One, and Mario Andretti retired. The team signed Michael Andretti for the seat vacated by his father. Canadian Paul Tracy, who had harsh words about Michael Andretti (notably at Toronto) in 1994 while driving for Marlboro Team Penske, became Michael's teammate (and Mansell's replacement) at Newman-Haas when Team Penske went from three cars to two. Gerry Forsythe and Barry Green, owners of Jacques Villeneuve's car in 1994, went their separate ways. Villeneuve stayed with the newly christened Team Green. Rahal-Hogan Racing released Mike Groff and signed Brazilian Raul Boesel and his Duracell sponsorship as a teammate to 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal. Chip Ganassi Racing lost both of its drivers from 1994, Michael Andretti and Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin. The team signed Jimmy Vasser from Hayhoe Racing and Bryan Herta from A. J. Foyt Racing. Eddie Cheever replaced Herta at A. J. Foyt Racing. PacWest Racing released both Dominic Dobson and Scott Sharp and signed 1985 Indianapolis 500 winner Danny Sullivan and Maurício Gugelmin, who came over from Ganassi Racing. Walker Racing released Willy T. Ribbs and Mark Smith and signed Brazilian rookie Christian Fittipaldi to team with Robby Gordon. Dick Simon Racing released Raul Boesel and Hiro Matsushita, signed Chilean rookie Eliseo Salazar, and added a second car at Phoenix for the rest of the season, driven primarily by Mexican rookie Carlos Guerrero. Hall Racing released Italian Teo Fabi and signed Brazilian rookie Gil de Ferran. Galles Racing added a second entry for Marco Greco from Long Beach until the end of the season to team with Adrian Fernandez. Payton/Coyne Racing signed Belgian Eric Bachelart as its second driver, teaming with Alessandro Zampedri.\nHayhoe Racing folded, and Jimmy Vasser signed with Chip Ganassi's team. King Racing folded, leaving Canadian Scott Goodyear without a full-time ride. Indy Regency Racing folded and returned to Indy Lights, leaving Dutchman Arie Luyendyk without a full-time ride. Euromotorsport also folded.\nNew teams.\nTasman Motorsports, which had won the last two Indy Lights championships, moved up from Indy Lights and brought with them one of their Indy Lights drivers, 1994 Indy Lights championship runner-up Brazilian Andre Ribeiro. Patrick Racing returned to the grid full-time after a three-year absence and after spending all of the 1994 season testing the new Firestone tires with driver Scott Pruett. Arciero Racing signed Hiro Matsushita and his Panasonic sponsorship. Gerry Forsythe left Forsythe/Green Racing to form the other new full-time team to the grid, Forsythe Racing, which signed Teo Fabi.\nSupplier changes from 1994.\nThe Rahal-Hogan team switched from Honda to the Ilmor-Mercedes engine. Comptech Racing, PacWest Racing and Walker Racing switched from the Lola Cars chassis to Reynard Motorsport, while Galles Racing switched from Reynard to Lola. Payton/Coyne Racing switched from Goodyear to Firestone tires.\nDrivers and teams.\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1995 Indy Car World Series season. Firestone returned to IndyCar after two decades of absence.\nSeason summary.\nSchedule.\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\nRace notes.\nMiami.\nThe return of the Grand Prix of Miami was held around Bicentennial Park. The race was presented by Toyota, who had announced plans to enter IndyCar racing in 1996 with Dan Gurney's All American Racers team. The grand marshal for the race was Mario Andretti, who had retired after the 1994 IndyCar season. Polesitter Michael Andretti returned to Newman-Haas Racing after two years with other teams (McLaren in the 1993 Formula One World Championship and Ganassi in the 1994 Indy Car World Series). Michael's new teammate Paul Tracy clipped a barrier in the Turn 3 chicane on Lap 2, bringing out a full-course yellow. A few laps after the restart Bryan Herta, in his first race for Ganassi, locked up the brakes in Turn 12 but missed the tire wall. At Lap 15 two possible winners dropped from contention; rookie Gil de Ferran, who had qualified an impressive 4th for Jim Hall, lost use of his transmission, and reigning IndyCar champion Al Unser Jr.' s new Penske PC-24 developed an electrical problem. On Lap 19 rookie Christian Fittipaldi made his first IndyCar pit stop and ran over the used left front tire as he left, catching a few inches of air. Eddie Cheever, another Formula One veteran, spun harmlessly in Turn 12 on Lap 22. Two laps later rookie Andre Ribeiro tried to meet the apex of Turn 10, but failed to see Adrian Fernandez in his mirrors. Their accident brought out another full-course yellow. Emerson Fittipaldi's engine failed during the yellow; another contender eliminated. After the restart, leader Michael Andretti was trying to pass rookie backmarker Eliseo Salazar in Turn 1. Salazar came down on him entering Turn 1, squeezing Michael into the inner wall, but he continued without incident and the car seemed to be running just fine. Later on that lap, Dennis Vitolo (perhaps best known for his crash in the 1994 Indianapolis 500 with Nigel Mansell) spun exiting the Turn 3 chicane. He hit the wall in the Pagan Racing Reynard but drove back to pits without further incident. On Lap 35 the yellow was out again after Payton/Coyne Racing's Alessandro Zampedri crashed in Turn 5.\nAt halfway the leaders were Michael Andretti, Maurício Gugelmin, Jacques Villeneuve, Danny Sullivan, Scott Pruett, and Bobby Rahal. For seventh place some intense racing took place between Chip Ganassi's new hire Jimmy Vasser and Walker Racing teammates Robby Gordon and Christian Fittipaldi. On Lap 50 Andretti made his final pit stop, but ended his day because the suspension damage in the right front (from the contact with Salazar) was too severe. This handed the lead to Gugelmin, Andretti's former teammate, for the first time in his IndyCar career. Soon after Andre Ribeiro found the Turn 5 tire barrier, meaning that final pit stops would occur under the yellow. Jacques Villeneuve's team won the battle out of the pits. With less than 20 laps to go, Sullivan spun out of 5th place right in front of Robby Gordon. The 1988 PPG Cup Champion stalled the engine, as he had not raced an IndyCar in 18 months, and the yellows were waved again. Bryan Herta was another victim of the Turn 5 wall a few laps later, but was rescued from the tires and finished the race. On Lap 84 Gordon crashed heavily in Turn 6 but walked away. Villeneuve held off Gugelmin and Rahal to win the first race of the new season.\nSurfers Paradise.\nSee 1995 Indycar Australia\nPhoenix.\nSophomore driver Bryan Herta won his first career pole with a new track record. In traffic, Herta and Paul Tracy diced for the lead until Michael Andretti took the lead on Lap 33. On Lap 39 rookie Andre Ribeiro crashed in Turn 2, bringing out the first yellow of the day. Andretti stayed in the lead, but polesitter Herta ran over his air hose and received a stop and go penalty after the restart. Tracy took the lead in Turn 1 with a four wide pass on the inside of Michael, Robby Gordon, and Dean Hall on the far right. Gordon, who was one lap down, took his lap back in Lap 61. Ten laps later Michael Andretti retook the lead. By halfway, 's winner Emerson Fittipaldi was in striking distance of the lead. He passed Andretti on Lap 105 to lead his first laps of the season. Soon after, the second caution flag was waved when Stefan Johansson's Bettenhausen-prepared Penske PC-23 trailed smoke. Michael Andretti was hoping for an adjustment in the left rear but it wasn't made. When the race restarted, Tracy briefly took the lead from Fittipaldi. Frontrunner Scott Pruett was charged with a stop and go penalty for a blend line violation during the yellow.\nWith less than 50 laps to go, rookie Gil de Ferran spun off Turn 2 and hit the inside tire wall and brought out the yellow flag again. On the restart Tracy took the lead from Fittipaldi again, and touched with Scott Pruett, one lap back after his stop and go. Pruett lost two more laps after a precautionary pit stop. Both Tracy and Fittipaldi pitted for a \"splash-and-go\", Emerson doing so with 7 laps to go. Michael Andretti was the new leader, but his crew did not inform him of this, and he allowed Robby Gordon to pass him for the win with 5 laps to go. Michael told ABC's Gary Gerould, \"I had no idea I was in the lead.\".\nLong Beach.\nA battle for third place went wrong on Lap 17 when Paul Tracy tried to pass rookie Gil de Ferran in Turn 3. The two collided and brought out the safety car. Bobby Rahal, Emerson Fittipaldi, and Michael Andretti all encountered troubles later while running second to Al Unser Jr. Andretti nearly spun at Lap 55 when he had simultaneously overtaken Unser and backmarker Dean Hall on the backstretch and locked up the rear brakes. He didn't crash, but dropped to 6th. Rahal took second, and nearly took the lead after pit stops, but his transmission failed after 77 laps. Fittipaldi's engine expired with 20 laps remaining. Andretti fought back to reclaim 2nd, but repeated his Lap 55 mistake on Lap 102. Because he had lost first gear earlier in the race, he stalled while trying to restart with 2nd gear. Teo Fabi stole 2nd, but was penalised because he did so under Andretti's local yellow flag. Eddie Cheever ran out of fuel on the final lap, and Christian Fittipaldi (who would have been on the lead lap) ran out before he could take the white flag, dropping to 14th. Unser won his record 6th Long Beach Grand Prix by 23 seconds.\nNazareth.\nEddie Cheever started 21st and made his second and final pit stop at Lap 106. Car owner and race engineer A. J. Foyt planned to keep Cheever on the track to the checkered flag, hoping for his first win as an owner since Foyt himself won the Pocono 500 in the 1981 USAC season. Cheever was looking for his first career IndyCar win; his best result had been 2nd to Bobby Rahal at Phoenix in 1992. Separate incidents for hometown favorite Michael Andretti and rookie Gil de Ferran helped Cheever conserve fuel. The race resumed at Lap 195 with Cheever in the lead. He rocketed away as the instrument panel indicated that he had ample fuel. However, fuel gremlins hadn't left Foyt's team since Long Beach, as the #14 ran out of fuel again in Turn 2 on Lap 199. Emerson Fittipaldi took the lead, held off Jacques Villeneuve, winning in eleven consecutive seasons (dating back to 1985), and claiming what would be his 22nd and final IndyCar victory.\nIndianapolis 500.\nThe Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC but was included in the championship.\nSee 1995 Indianapolis 500 for race results and other information.\nMilwaukee.\nItaly's Teo Fabi, driving for Forsythe Racing won his first pole since Denver in 1990 for the Porsche team. The start was aborted after an improper field alignment, but the start was clean on Lap 2. On Lap 7 Michael Andretti touched Robby Gordon's left rear tire with his right front wing; the contact was dramatic but harmless. Fabi led the first 27 laps until Al Unser Jr. (looking to put the DNQ at Indy behind him) overtook him in traffic. Behind him, Paul Tracy was making bold passes on the outside in the same traffic. Fabi was the first to make a pit stop at Lap 63, followed by Unser at Lap 65. Tracy came in ten laps later, followed by his teammate Andretti, who stalled exiting his pit and lost several seconds before continuing. Unser reclaimed the lead after the first round of stops. At Lap 124 the first real yellow of the day (the aborted start counting as the first) came when Chilean rookie Eliseo Salazar spun in Turn 4. Emerson Fittipaldi attempted to sneak into the pits for his final stop, but after he slowed to avoid Salazar he collected marbles on his tires which, adding to his oversteer condition, caused him to spin into the pitlane and he nudged the inside wall with the right rear. He was done for the day. Under the yellow the leaders made their second and final pit stops, and Tracy beat Unser out of the pits. Al Jr. retook the lead from Tracy on Lap 144, and as they sliced through lapped traffic Tracy took the lead with 22 laps to go. A few laps later, Tracy tried to pass a group of cars (trailed by Alessandro Zampedri) on the outside, and he lost traction momentarily but continued without further incident. Fuel concerns were eminent in both the Penske and Newman-Haas pits, but Tracy took the checkered flag ahead of a fast-closing Unser by less than one second.\nPortland.\nAl Unser Jr. took the chequered flag, but Jimmy Vasser was declared the winner. Unser was disqualified because of ride height issues. This was caused by erosion of the skidplate on the kerbing. Shortly after the season was over, Unser was re-declared the winner, taking from Vasser what would have been his first CART IndyCar win.\nToronto.\nIndyCar point leader Jacques Villeneuve set a new track record (57.230 seconds) in winning his third consecutive pole for the 10th annual Molson Indy Toronto. Inaugural winner Bobby Rahal and four-time Toronto winner Michael Andretti, neither of whom had won in 1995, started in Row 3. The first incident of the day began when Stefan Johansson tried to sneak around Raul Boesel in Turn 3 (a hard braking zone and passing opportunity where many incidents take place) but bumped Bryan Herta into the wall. Herta then bounced off Eddie Cheever, damaging the right front suspension, and stalled the engine after missing the corner. On Lap 9 the order was Villeuenve, Vasser, Pruett, Andretti, Tracy, Fabi, Rahal, Unser and de Ferran, followed by Robby Gordon and rookie Andre Ribeiro, who tried to outbrake Gordon in Turn 3 in a battle for 10th place. Ribeiro spun after they touched and dropped to last. On Lap 17 Pruett spun out of 3rd place in Turn 8. On the next lap Unser tried to outbrake Rahal (who was stuck behind Fabi, who was a bit off the pace) in Turn 3, but the two champions touched and Unser tagged the outside wall, and the first full-course yellow was brought out. Stefan Johansson, who had just pitted, lost his right rear tire coming onto the backstretch. Pruett then retired with a leak in the cooling system after setting the fastest lap of the race. In a strange scoring error, leader Villeneuve was dropped to 5th after his pit stop because he was not picked up as the leader. Car owner Barry Green was not pleased. The restart was interrupted by an unusual situation at the back of the field. 16th placed Éric Bachelart was involved in a spectacular Turn 7 accident that also involved Eliseo Salazar, Marco Greco, and Carlos Guerrero, who was launched over Alessandro Zampedri. Bachelart said in his interview with Gary Gerould that the field, several seconds in front of him, suddenly slowed down after catching the leaders. Turn 7 is a flat corner (taken without lifting off the throttle) and a blind corner, catching the cars involved by surprise. Guerrero shared Bachelart's opinion. No one was injured in the melee.\nOn the restart Michael Andretti led Maurício Gugelmin and Paul Tracy. Tracy tried to outbrake Gugelmin on the outside of Turn 3, but the two touched wheels and Tracy spun. Michael and \"Big Mo\" were now trailed by Bobby Rahal, Villeneuve, and Jimmy Vasser. Rahal began losing ground behind Gugelmin, who had yet to pit, and was trapped behind him until the Brazilian pitted at Lap 43. At the same time, backmarker Buddy Lazier spun the Project Indy car in Turn 3. A lap later Andretti caught backmarker Hiro Matsushita, already infamous for not yielding to the leaders, and lost 4 of the 9 seconds he had gained over Rahal. The two pitted on Lap 63 with over 15 seconds over 3rd placed Jacques Villeneuve, who pitted on the next lap. No change among the leaders through pit stops, but Rahal caught Andretti in lapped traffic; the pack included Johansson, Ribeiro, Cheever, and Danny Sullivan, who lost 5 laps after a tow back to the pits. At Lap 75 Sullivan passed Cheever, who tried to meet his apex after being passed. When Cheever turned in he touched the leader Andretti, who was trying to lap him. The light contact didn't appear to damage the car. 4th place Vasser dropped from the race with 13 laps to go with a broken header. Michael Andretti took the win ahead of Rahal and point leader Villeneuve.\nCleveland.\nRookie Gil de Ferran claimed his first CART pole position with a new track record (58.328 seconds, 146.2 mph). At the start, in Turns 9 and 10 (the final chicane), rookie Andre Ribeiro and 1993 Cleveland winner Paul Tracy touched wheels and spun off. Both made unsuccessful attempts to continue in the race, and retired early. Scott Pruett was also caught up in the mess, losing a lap before returning. Throughout the bulk of the race de Ferran exploited the potential of his car, proving to be difficult to beat. Second placed Teo Fabi, if anybody, seemed to be the only man who could outrun him. Behind them, Michael Andretti and Bryan Herta were in close proximity for most of the race. They were later joined by Robby Gordon and point leader Jacques Villeneuve as the \"best of the rest\". Mid-race, Gordon and Villeneuve showed their own competitive spirits (perhaps too competitive) by pressing on each other through Turn 2 and missing Turn 3. Each ran through the grass and continued on. Teo Fabi stayed out several laps longer than de Ferran for final pit stops, coming in at Lap 66. He left with a 4-second lead over de Ferran, but came back in immediately and retired the car with a broken header.\nÉric Bachelart crashed in Turn 9 to bring out the final caution flag. On the restart, 4th placed Robby Gordon took the lead briefly with a very deep entry into Turn 1. de Ferran held the lead, but was again challenged next time around in Turn 1 when Andretti passed him on the outside as Gordon passed him on the inside (ironically, all three cars were sponsored by rival brands of motor oil). Gordon slowed with a flat tyre (blaming Andretti over the radio to Derrick Walker), dropping from contention. With 5 laps to go, de Ferran passed Andretti for the lead exiting Turn 8 and was about to lap Scott Pruett as well. Proper racing etiquette is that a lapped car, regardless of pace should yield to a lead lap car. However, Pruett did not do this, and collided with de Ferran (who perhaps was not close enough to make Pruett think that he would attempt a pass), putting them both out of the race. The order was now Andretti, Herta, and Villeneuve. On Lap 89 (of 90) Herta went for the lead in Turn 9, but he slowed to let Andretti by because of the local yellow (overtaking is illegal in a yellow zone). Jacques Villeneuve had the proper momentum to pass both of them, and after a touch with Andretti in Turn 1, he took off and won his 5th race in 28 starts. ABC Sports' Sam Posey called this race the greatest of the year, and pointed out that the widest course on the schedule was producing the closest racing.\nMarlboro 500.\nBefore qualifications, Walker Racing's Robby Gordon had a hard practice accident, forcing the Valvoline crew to withdraw. Parker Johnstone won the first IndyCar pole position for Honda. The start was aborted twice, due to improper alignment of the field, but the rookie polesitter was not at fault. Later on, championship leader Jacques Villeneuve came into the pitlane unexpectedly with wheel hub problems. Johnstone soon had the same issues, as did Maurício Gugelmin. This problem was thought to be limited to the Reynard cars, but this myth was dispelled when Bobby Rahal's Lola was similarly diagnosed.\nNearing halfway rookie Andre Ribeiro established himself as the car to beat, but after a routine pit stop his car failed to get up to race pace. He then retired with electrical issues. Polesitter Parker Johnstone also dropped out with brake failure, and 3rd place runner Eddie Cheever's gearbox quit. At Lap 194 Danny Sullivan's great career ended when he crashed in Turn 1. Lyn St. James, driving for Dick Simon, lost an engine while running in the Top 10 and Sullivan lost control in the oil. Bryan Herta struck a stray tyre from the accident, ending his day as well. Sullivan's injuries included a broken pelvis, and had to withdraw from the Brickyard 400 the following weekend. He later announced his retirement from auto racing (later becoming a driver analyst for ABC and ESPN's IndyCar coverage). Scott Pruett and Al Unser Jr. were alone in the lead lap and made their final scheduled stops during this long yellow flag.\nThe race resumed at Lap 207 with Unser beating Pruett out of the pitlane. Unser appeared to be out of contention at Lap 230 when he pitted with blistering on the right rear tyre, but he stayed in the lead lap and caught a lucky yellow thanks to an unfortunate Alessandro Zampedri, who crashed in Turn 4 at Lap 238. When the race restarted Unser, in his 200th IndyCar start, was flying through the field, and it was only a matter of time before he caught Patrick Racing's Pruett. The Californian barely led at the white flag as Unser swept around him, but he made great use of the draft and pulled the same move through Turns 3 and 4. At the pit entry Pruett had the lead and beat Unser by a carlength, giving Firestone Tires their first IndyCar win since the 1970s, and Patrick's first win since Nazareth in September of 1989 with Emerson Fittipaldi.\nMid-Ohio.\nPoint leader Jacques Villeneuve set a new track record in qualifying; the eight such occurrence of the season. Al Unser Jr., starting in Row 4, came in during the parade laps with a flat tire. At the start Americans Eddie Cheever and Scott Pruett touched wheels and collected compatriot Parker Johnstone, who spun off in Turn 4 (the starts at Mid-Ohio take place on the backstretch, just after Turn 3). Johnstone's day was over before it started. A few laps later, Brazilians Raul Boesel and Andre Ribeiro received stop and go penalties for overtaking under the Turn 4 yellow, the site of Johnstone's accident. Through the first 20 laps only Michael Andretti could match the pace of polesitter Villeneuve, both men several seconds ahead of third placed Maurício Gugelmin. By this time, however, the wicker on Andretti's rear wing came loose, and ultimately the left side of the wicker flew off. But Andretti stayed on Villeneuve, apparently unaffected by the \"wing change\". Little Al made his first pit stop at Lap 23, a bit earlier than the leaders who were negotiating traffic. Pay drivers Hiro Matsushita, Eliseo Salazar, and Carlos Guerrero were not easy for Jacques and Michael to overtake. The duo pitted on Lap 29, with no position change, but Michael made a dramatic pass in Turn 7 (a part of the esses, or the \"twisty bits\", as they are also called at Mid-Ohio) to take the spot. The pass was not for the lead, however, because rookie Gil de Ferran stayed out for a few more laps on a light fuel load. De Ferran went from 5th to 3rd after his pit stops completed the first round of stops. Soon after pit stops second place Villeneuve reported braking problems, which was later diagnosed as a boiling problem on a very warm and humid day. Rookie Andre Ribeiro was soon very warm when he brought the Tasman car into the pits unscheduled; a fire developed in the rear of the car when the fuel vent stack stuck open allowing fuel to gush out and ignite on the exhaust. De Ferran took second from Villeneuve whose pace had slowed due to concern over the brakes. On Lap 39 Bobby Rahal, the crowd favorite who had moved up from 8th to 4th in the pit stops, tried Villeneuve on the outside of Turn 5. They touched wheels and Rahal was sent into the wall. Neither he nor the crowd were pleased with Villeneuve, who was given enough room according to Rahal. Al Unser Jr., off sequence with the leaders, pitted under the full course yellow.\nAfter the restart rookie point leader Christian Fittipaldi jumped out in his pit stall with a fire in the back. 2nd placed de Ferran dropped out with engine failure, meaning that the top three rookies were all out of the race. Final stops began on Lap 54 when Robby Gordon brought the Walker Racing #5 car in. The air gun for the right front tire changer failed, adding nearly 30 seconds to the pit stop time. Robby expressed his displeasure over the radio to Derrick Walker, lamenting that their race had been thrown away. Leader Michael Andretti pitted with 24 laps to go, and did not lead again until Vileneuve, Paul Tracy, and Unser made their pit stops. Unser stretched his fuel to Lap 70; 14 laps to go. Typical of Roger Penske's strategic thinking, this pit sequence moved Unser up to second, behind Andretti and ahead of Andretti's teammate Tracy. Andretti's lead was unassailable with 4 laps to go, but he slowed with a broken header and could only sit forlornly in Turn 6, pondering what might have been. Despite the unusual pit strategy, Al Unser Jr. captured the win over Tracy, Villeneuve, Adrian Fernandez, and Bryan Herta.\nLoudon.\nAndre Ribeiro won his first pole with a new track record. Adrian Fernandez crashed in Turn 2 on Lap 1 (he had crashed in Turn 3 in Friday practice). On Lap 42 Scott Pruett crashed in front of Michael Andretti, who took the lead during the pit stops. At halfway Paul Tracy was black flagged for an oil leak, and was prevented by CART officials from returning to the race, leaving the Canadian fuming. With three laps to go a battle for 20th went wrong as Marco Greco and Buddy Lazier (both 13 laps down) crashed, and the race ended under yellow. Indy Lights graduate Andre Ribeiro won his first IndyCar race; also the first for his team and for Honda.\nVancouver.\nJacques Villeneuve won his fifth pole position of the year, setting yet another track record (which was no longer a surprise by this time of the season). The point for the pole was crucial for Villeneuve, who could eliminate Al Unser Jr. from championship contention, and thus become the 1995 champion. The start was clean, but in Turn 5 (a tight and tricky chicane) Unser tangled with rookie Gil de Ferran in a battle for 7th. Unser continued but de Ferran, who was on the outside, was flung into the air after wheel contact and struck the barrier. The red flag was issued and the first lap was nullified. De Ferran's team managed to prepare the backup car for the second start. The second attempt was aborted when Villeneuve jumped the green flag. The third start was the official start. Rookie leader Christian Fittipaldi slowed with a flat right rear tire after contact with uncle Emmo, who pitted for a new nosecone behind Villeneuve, Jimmy Vasser, Bobby Rahal, Scott Goodyear (in his third start of the year), and Michael Andretti. Vasser dropped out on Lap 7 with a broken header, moving Robby Gordon into the Top 5. At the same time Formula One veteran Domenico Schiattarella spun the Project Indy car in Turn 5, bringing out Johnny Rutherford in the safety car again. By Lap 20 the leaders had caught Hiro Matsushita, which compressed the Top 6 cars (Villeneuve, Rahal, Andretti, Gordon, Unser, and Teo Fabi). On lap 23 Andretti made one of his trademark bold passes in Turn 10 to get second from Rahal, and behind them Al Jr. passed Gordon. Rahal pitted on Lap 25, and the lead changed hands when Andretti repeated his Lap 23 pass on Villeneuve. The French-Canadian's loss of pace was because of a loss of grip, as he locked up tires and stepped the back end out on acceleration trying to keep second place ahead of Al Junior. He locked up the fronts in Turn 5, allowing Unser to set up a great exit and launch around Villeneuve, who dropped to 7th by Turn 8 and pitted on that lap, taking the harder compound of Goodyear Eagles. On Lap 39 Unser pitted and Teo Fabi spun the Forsythe car in Turn 5. He did not hit a wall or stall the engine, but leader Andretti took no chances and made his first pit stop.\nAt Lap 49 Andretti and Unser, the only former winners of the Molson Indy Vancouver, were in close proximity some 17 seconds ahead of third place Paul Tracy when the yellow was waved for Marco Greco, whose Galles Racing entry was stopped on the pit straight. After the restart Gil de Ferran, who had done very well in the early going to keep his backup car in 5th place, could not pass the lapped car of Carlos Guerrero. Behind him, Andre Ribeiro attempted to pass him on the pit straight, but running side by side through the first turn usually doesn't work, and Ribeiro clipped the wall with the right front and brought out the yellow again. Unser, who had set the fastest lap earlier, passed Andretti for the lead on Lap 60. It wasn't long before Andretti lost use of second gear, the culprit from Long Beach. Though Michael was no longer a threat to Unser's bid for the win, having dropped out of the race, Unser was getting fed up with Raul Boesel who was on the tail end of the lead lap. On Lap 66 Tracy made a pass on Bryan Herta for 3rd in Turn 3, but locked up the rear tires and collected Herta and 5th place Maurício Gugelmin, ending the Brazilian's day. With 20 laps to go, Jacques Villeneuve was running 5th behind Unser, Rahal, de Ferran, and Gordon, when he suddenly lost 5th and 6th gears. Scott Goodyear, one lap down, swerved to avoid hitting Villeneuve, and clipped him coming into the sweeping Turn 9. Goodyear nearly hit the tire barrier in Turn 10 as his left rear was flattened by Jacques' front wing. After Bobby Rahal pitted from 2nd, \"Albuquerque Al\" was unchallenged on his way to his 30th IndyCar win (pending the appeal from Portland) ahead of Gil de Ferran. Al would keep the championship fight alive if Team Penske won the appeal.\nLaguna Seca.\nWith the Portland appeal set to take place after the conclusion of the season, the championship was not entirely settled. Assuming Team Penske won the appeal, Al Unser Jr. still had a chance, but as long as point leader Jacques Villeneuve finished 8th or better, he would be the champion regardless of Unser's result. Jacques won his 6th pole of the season, with another track record and a precious championship point. Unser started a lowly 14th.\nThe full course yellow was displayed on the opening lap as Robby Gordon spun out of Turn 1 after a touch with Adrian Fernandez. As Villeneuve led from the start, his front rowmate Bryan Herta lost several positions before losing 5 laps in the pitlane with engine problems in Chip Ganassi Racing's final race with the Ford-Cosworth powerplants. A lap later Parker Johnstone spun and stalled in Turn 1, but the corner workers got him rolling again to avoid another safety car deployment. As Unser marched into the Top 10, Alessandro Zampedri spun his Dale Coyne Racing entry in Turn 11 and brought out the second full course caution. After maintaining the lead, Villeneuve pitted on Lap 29, followed by rookie Gil de Ferran and 1983 Laguna winner Teo Fabi one lap later. De Ferran's Jim Hall-led crew got the drop on Team Green, which was crucial for the Brazilian's slim chances of leapfrogging countryman Christian Fittipaldi for IndyCar Rookie of the Year. After trailing de Ferran for a few laps, Villeneuve suddenly made an unscheduled stop due to a slow puncture on the right front. This dropped him to 13th, over 35 seconds out of the lead, and about 25 seconds behind title rival Unser, who had climbed up to 6th after pitting a few laps early. Just beyond halfway, the order was de Ferran, Paul Tracy, Mauricio Gugelmin, Unser Jr, and Fabi.\nAt Lap 45, Villeneuve pitted a 3rd time, while the other leaders had yet to begin the second round of pit stops. The problem was the same as before: a slow right front puncture, but the culprit was the brake vent which had apparently been rubbing the tire. De Ferran pitted from the lead on Lap 54, maintaining his comfortable lead over Tracy after Gugelmin led briefly. Gordon found trouble again, this time in Turn 11 because of contact with backmarker Marco Greco; Gordon came in to replace a broken front wing, and Greco with a flailing left rear tire carcass. With Unser running 7th at the completion of scheduled pit stops, Villeneuve came in for a 4th stop to replace the front wing, with adjusted placement of the brake vents.\nThe final caution flag of the day was displayed with 20 laps to go when rookie Andre Ribeiro collided with the lapped car of Bryan Herta, sending the New Hampshire winner into the wall leading up to Turn 3. Rookie leader Christian Fittipaldi spun exiting Turn 5, retiring shortly afterwards and surrendering any opportunity to contest rookie honors with de Ferran controlling the race. De Ferran claimed Rookie of the Year by taking his first IndyCar win by 8 seconds over twice defending race winner Paul Tracy. Mauricio Gugelmin, Michael Andretti, and Scott Pruett completed the Top 5. Unser came home 6th, ahead of Bobby Rahal, Jimmy Vasser, Teo Fabi, and Adrian Fernandez on the lead lap. 11th place Jacques Villeneuve became the youngest national champion in the modern era at the age of 24, and the 2nd youngest in history (Louis Meyer was also 24 in 1928). The F1-bound French-Canadian was a lap down with Raul Boesel, who claimed the final point."

        "title": "Trick bowling",
        "text": "Trick bowling is a form of competitive bowling in which unusual and difficult custom setups are used. Trick bowling often involves special pin setup, multiple bowling balls, or obstacles placed on the lane.\nTrick Bowling has a rich history in bowling leagues across the country, and has more recently become a staple of the world's most popular and largest professional bowling league, the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA).\nPopular trick shots.\nMultiple pin strike: As opposed to the standard 10-pin bowling setup, this trick is set up with more than 10 pins (usually to 30 to over 100 pins) in the same triangular formation as the standard 10-pin setup and played on an open area instead of a bowling lane. The bowler usually releases the ball with a great strength and/or a precision technique to ensure that the ball has enough strength to start a chain reaction that will knock down all pins. This trick is often implemented in bowling video games, with \"Wii Sports\" being the most famous example. \nSpinning-ball spare conversion: The bowler spins one ball slowly down the lane, and sends a second ball down the lane normally. The second ball is meant to knock down nine pins, while the first slowly spun ball picks up the spare.\nTowel shot: A shot perfected by PBA Legend Norm Duke. The bowler wraps the ball in a handtowel, and releases it in a slingshot-like manner down the lane. This shot is very difficult because the bowler has no fingers in the ball, and it is very difficult to create spin and maintain accuracy.\nMultiple balls: A bowler will take three or more balls in one hand and attempt to knock down as many pins as possible pick up a difficult split.\nOff-hand bowl: The bowler takes the ball and bowls it with his off hand, or the hand he would not normally bowl with. For instance, a right-handed bowler bowling with his or her left hand.\nBackwards approach shot: The bowler, facing away from the pins, throws the ball between his legs without looking down the lane.\nMarked shots: The bowler will place a marker on the lane, the most common being a small piece of tape, and the ball must cross over that marker before knocking down the pins.\nReduced finger shots: Instead of putting the normal two fingers and a thumb in the ball, the bowler will use only two, or even one finger in the ball and roll it down the lane trying to knock down the required number of pins, usually a spare pickup. \nProp shots: A prop shot is where the bowler places an object or person in the lane to create an obstacle for the shot and make it more difficult. The most common props are chairs and people. Chairs are set up in the lane, and the bowler must either bowl over them or through the legs. For people, the most common setup is to bowl through their legs.. A variation of this trick is to throw the ball to the air from a distance, and landing onto the lane.\nFlying eagle: A variation of the hardest spare pickup in bowling: the 7–10 split. This shot requires two lanes. The 7 pin is set up in the lane that the bowler throws the ball down, while the 10 pin is set up in the lane to the right. Another pin is set up further up in the lane with the 7 pin. The bowler must hit the lead pin, send it flying into the adjacent lane to knock down the 10 pin, and the ball must continue through and hit the 7 pin.\nTrick bowling at the professional level.\nIn the days before the PBA's existence, Andy Varipapa was well known for his trick bowling. More recently, the PBA brought trick bowling to the national spotlight by creating a trick bowling competition, similar to the All-Star games of other professional sports leagues, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Football League, and National Hockey League. The PBA's trick bowling competition is known as the \"skills challenge.\" Some of the PBA's top bowlers have participated in the competition, including Parker Bohn III, Norm Duke, Chris Barnes, Del Ballard, Jr., Wes Malott, Doug Kent, Brian Voss, Danny Wiseman and Chris Johnson.\nThe format in the skills challenge is like a game of \"horse\" in basketball. One bowler attempts the trick shot, and his opponent has the chance to match it. If the opponent cannot match the challenger's shot, the challenger gets a point. The first bowler to three points wins.\nChanges in format.\nIn the 2006-2007 Skills Challenge, the format changed from a head-to-head style competition to a team-based competition, with teams of two. This added a new dynamic to the competition, because partners could bowl together and create more difficult shots.\nHowever, after negative reactions from the fanbase, the format was changed back to head-to-head in the 2007-2008 competition.\nPBA Skills Challenge Champions.\n2004-2005: Chris Barnes\n2005-2006: Norm Duke\n2006-2007: Doug Kent And Danny Wiseman\n2007-2008: Chris Barnes"

        "title": "Ernie Adams (American football)",
        "text": "Ernie Adams (born March 31, 1953) is a former American football coach and researcher best known for his years with the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He is a longtime friend and associate of head coach Bill Belichick, first meeting Belichick when they played high school football together. With Adams, the Patriots won six Super Bowls. Adams is renowned for his extremely thorough analysis of the game, as well as his casual style of dress and his low profile.\nEarly years.\nAdams attended the Dexter School near Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts. Given his knowledge of football for his age, Adams was asked to coach the school's intramural football team as an eighth grader.\nHe later attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts for high school. While there, he read \"Football Scouting Methods\" written by Steve Belichick, who was then a football scout for the United States Naval Academy. In 1970, Steve Belichick's son Bill enrolled at Phillips Academy for a post-graduate year after graduating from Annapolis High School. Adams, a senior, recognized Belichick's name and the two quickly became friends. At one point, they snuck into a Boston College football practice together to practice scouting.\nBeginning in 1971, Adams attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. As a freshman, Adams sought a student assistant position for the Wildcats' football team and secured it after impressing an assistant coach with a report on a football formation. He would serve as a scout for Northwestern until his graduation in 1975 with a degree in education.\nProfessional career.\nFirst stint with Patriots.\nAfter his graduation from college, Adams pursued an unpaid position with the New England Patriots in 1975. After contacting then-head coach Chuck Fairbanks numerous times, Adams received a playbook from assistant coach Hank Bullough to learn; Adams learned it in two days, and was presented with another playbook, which he again learned in two days. Adams was hired as an offensive and administrative assistant, and eventually prepared scouting reports for the team, which Fairbanks said were the most thorough he had received in his career.\nNew York Giants.\nIn 1979, Patriots assistant Ray Perkins was hired to be the head coach of the New York Giants. He promptly hired Adams as an offensive assistant, working with quarterbacks and receivers. Adams then convinced Perkins to hire Belichick as a special teams coach; Belichick had spent the previous eight years as a student at Wesleyan University and as an assistant coach for three NFL teams. Adams spent three seasons as the Giants' offensive assistant before moving to their scouting department as pro personnel director. By 1985, he had become frustrated with that job, and took a lucrative job offer as a municipal bonds trader on Wall Street.\nCleveland Browns.\nAdams left Wall Street to join the Cleveland Browns in 1991, where Belichick had just been named to his first NFL head coaching position. Adams was again an offensive assistant, working with tight ends and running backs. However, Belichick was fired by the franchise after the Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens in 1996, and Adams returned to Wall Street, starting his own investment business.\nSecond stint with Patriots.\nBelichick got his next coaching opportunity with the Patriots in 2000. This time, Adams joined the team not as a coach, but as Football Research Director. Adams filled a variety of roles for the team. On gamedays, he assisted the coaching staff from the team's upper level skybox, where his duties included advising Belichick on which plays to issue a replay challenge. For many years, the Patriots' gameday communications system included a telephone handset labeled \"ERNIE\" that was mounted within easy reach of Belichick, other coaches and key players. He also assisted the scouting department in preparing for the NFL draft in the spring, and built the team's player value chart for the draft. Also, Adams worked on special assignments for the coaching and scouting staffs, which typically involve breaking down game tape. In 2007, as part of Spygate, it was revealed that Adams received tapes from a \"third camera\" that recorded opponents' defensive signals from a location on the sideline, in violation of a league memo issued by commissioner Roger Goodell. Belichick confirmed this was the case, but said that they were only a small part of the \"mosaic\" that formed the Patriots' offensive game plans at the time.\nAdams and Belichick were known to have an interest in mathematical analyses of football; Adams once contacted Rutgers University statistics professor Harold Sackrowitz, asking him to evaluate the Patriots' two-point conversion chart following a study by Sackrowitz on the decision. Adams also presented Belichick with a study concluding teams punt too often on fourth down.\nWith the Patriots and throughout his career, Adams was known for keeping a low profile. Former Browns owner Art Modell notably quipped, \"I'll pay anyone here $10,000 if they can tell me what Ernie Adams does.\"\nOn May 1, 2021, it was announced that the 2021 draft would end his tenure with the Patriots. His last day of work for the organization was at the conclusion of the offseason program on June 16, 2021, retiring afterwards."

        "text": "Daniel Taylor (born April 28, 1986) is a Canadian-Belarusian professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was drafted in the seventh round (221st overall) of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings and has appeared in four NHL games with the Kings, Calgary Flames, and Ottawa Senators.\nInternationally Taylor played for the Belarusian national team at the 2021 World Championships.\nPlaying career.\nThe son of a British mother and Canadian father working for the British army, Taylor moved with his family to the Ottawa suburb of Orleans, Ontario when he was two years old. He spent three seasons in the Ontario Hockey League playing for the Guelph Storm and Kingston Frontenacs before moving onto professional hockey. Taylor spent the majority of the 2007–08 season with the Manchester Monarchs of the AHL. He played in 23 games, posting a 13–5–2 record. He also had a 2.40 GAA, 0.921 save percentage and recorded four shut-outs. He earned a recall to the Kings, and made his NHL debut on March 29, 2008, in relief of starting goaltender Erik Ersberg. Taylor played the third period, giving up two goals in what was a 7–2 loss to the Dallas Stars. Taylor returned to the Monarchs for the 2008–09 season and played 15 games, recording a 7–4–2 record. That year he had a 2.66 GAA and a 0.909 save percentage.\nFor the 2009–10 season Taylor was signed to a professional try-out agreement by the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL. He played in nine games that year for the Crunch, posting a 2–4–0 record before he was released from the agreement. He also had a 3.63 GAA and 0.896 save percentage.\nThe next year, Taylor signed with the Springfield Falcons. Taylor stayed with the team for the 2010–11 season and played in four games, having a 2–2–0 record. He had a 2.35 GAA and a 0.929 save percentage. He played the remainder of the season in Germany with the Hamburg Freezers. Taylor returned to the Falcons for the 2011–12 season. In ten games with Springfield he posted a 5–3–0 record with a 2.58 GAA and a .914 save percentage, but there was a crowded crease in Springfield with Taylor, Manny Legace, and Allen York, and Taylor was bounced out. But it did not take long for him to get signed as he was picked up by the Abbotsford Heat of the AHL.\nOn August 10, 2012, Taylor was extended by the Heat to a one-year contract for the 2012–13 season. He was among the AHL's goaltending leaders midway through the season with a second-best GAA of 1.77 and was fourth in save percentage at .930 when an injury to Calgary Flames' goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff led the Flames to sign Taylor to an NHL contract on February 6 and recall him to Calgary. He spent several days with the Flames, but was returned to Abbotsford without seeing action. However, he was again recalled to Calgary on February 16, replacing Leland Irving as the backup goaltender to Joey MacDonald.\nFive years after his first NHL game, Taylor finally made his second appearance (and first NHL start) on February 18, 2013, against the Phoenix Coyotes. He made 37 saves, but the Flames lost the game 4–0. In his second start, on March 3, Taylor earned his first NHL victory with a 4–2 win over the Vancouver Canucks.\nA free agent following the season, Taylor chose to go to Sweden. He signed a contract to play with Färjestad BK in the SHL for the 2013–14 season and helped the team reach the finals. He then spent the 2014–15 season with HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), before joining fellow KHL side Medvescak Zagreb. In the course of the 2015–16 campaign, he was transferred to Czech outfit HC Sparta Praha.\nOn July 6, 2016, the Zagreb team announced that Taylor would return for the 2016–17 season.

        "text": "The 2000 United States Open Championship was the 100th U.S. Open Championship, held June 15–18 at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California. Tiger Woods won his first U.S. Open by a record-setting fifteen strokes over runners-up Ernie Els and Miguel Ángel Jiménez – it remains the most dominating performance and victory in any major championship. As the United States Golf Association wanted to begin the millennium with a memorable tournament, Pebble Beach was moved up two years in the rotation. Notable golfers going into the tournament at large included Jack Nicklaus, playing in his final U.S. Open; Vijay Singh, the year's Masters winner; Ernie Els; and David Duval.\nDefending champion Payne Stewart had died in an aviation accident on October 25 the previous year at the age of 42. His death was commemorated many times throughout the week, starting with a ceremony on the eve of the tournament at the 18th hole. Speakers included Stewart's widow Tracey and his good friend Paul Azinger, while attendees included Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, David Duval, Tom Lehman, Lee Janzen, Sergio García and Stewart's caddy Mike Hicks, and it concluded with shots being hit into Stillwater Cove in a golf version of a 21-gun salute. García also wore Stewart's trademark navy plus fours in Stewart's honor in the first round. Nicklaus was asked to take Stewart's spot in the traditional opening grouping of the prior year's Open Championship (British Open) winner (Paul Lawrie), U.S. Amateur winner (David Gossett), and U.S. Open winner, and he asked for a moment of silence in Stewart's memory before his opening tee shot.\nAside from being the last U.S. Open appearance for Nicklaus, playing in his 44th consecutive U.S. Open, it was also the last appearance for two-time winner Curtis Strange.\nCourse layout.\nPrevious course lengths for major championships\nThe 2nd hole was previously played as a par-5.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 15, 2000\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Friday, June 16, 2000\"\nPlayers who started early took advantage of the calm conditions before dense fog came in. The second hole proved difficult for many golfers. USGA officials changed the hole from a par-5 to a par-4. Tiger Woods, with an early starting time, fired a six-under 65 to take the first round lead. 75 golfers were unable to complete their rounds due to fog and finished Friday morning. Local favorite and CBS commentator Bobby Clampett, playing in his first event in 21 months, shot 68 to tie for fourth with Hale Irwin and Loren Roberts, three shots behind Woods. Players' Championship winner Hal Sutton tied for seventh after chipping in on the 1st hole for the first ever opening hole eagle in U.S. Open history.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 16, 2000\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, June 17, 2000\"\nWeather conditions made the course extremely difficult for scoring. Tiger Woods, however, seemed almost impervious to the conditions and continued to make birdies to stretch his lead. On the 6th hole, Woods fired a now famous approach to reach the par-5 in two shots, ripping an iron from deep rough over the ocean and a cypress tree and winding up within 15 feet from the hole. He would two-putt for birdie, would also birdie the 7th and 11th holes. With darkness settling in, Woods and his playing partners decided to attempt to play the 12th hole, a par 3, before halting play. Woods made the most of it, sinking a 30-foot putt for birdie and finishing his day with a large fist pump.\nAfter returning on Saturday, Woods hooked his tee shot on the 18th hole into the Pacific, which left him with only one ball left, but drove straight at the second attempt and bogeyed the hole to finish with two-under par 69. With the scoring average so difficult, he still increased his lead to six shots. Playing his last U.S. Open hole, Nicklaus memorably reached the 18th green in two shots but ultimately three-putted for par. Lee Westwood finished the round tied for sixth after making an 80-foot eagle putt on the 18th hole for the first eagle on that hole during a U.S. Open.\nAmateurs: \"Wilson (+4)\", Baddeley (+11), Barnes (+11), Gossett (+13), Lile (+14), McLuen (+16).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 2000\"\nThe 36-hole cut was 149 (+7), and only 63 players advanced to the third round. The low number was attributed to the fact that the cut is the top 60 players and ties, plus anyone within 10 strokes of the leader. Only 17 players were within 10 strokes of Woods. Conditions on Saturday were brutal for scoring, with the wind blowing hard and the rough difficult to manage. Woods, after finishing his 2nd round 69, made a triple bogey on the third hole but multiple birdies eventually put him back at even par for the round. Woods drained a 15-foot putt on the 9th hole, the most difficult on the course, and finished at even par for the day with a 71. His ten stroke lead was the largest 54-hole lead of a U.S. Open.\nErnie Els shot the low round of the day with a 68, the only round under par all day, to put him into second place.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 18, 2000\"\nTiger Woods won his third major championship in amazing fashion after a final round 67. Woods began his day by making nine consecutive pars, but he only missed one fairway and one green on his way to an outward 35. He would end his par streak with a birdie at the 10th, while his competitors faltered on the brutal poa annua greens. Woods then made three consecutive birdies at 12, 13 and 14 to move to 12-under par. After a par at 15, Woods then got up and down at both 16 and 17 for pars. He would par the final hole to finish off a bogey-free 67. At twelve strokes under par, he was the only player to finish at even par or better and became the first player in the 106-year history of the U.S. Open to finish at double-digits under par. Only one other player had even reached double-digits under par in a U.S. Open – Gil Morgan in 1992, the last time the tournament had been held at Pebble Beach. Woods' aggregate 272 tied what was then the lowest score ever in a U.S. Open set by Nicklaus, Lee Janzen and Jim Furyk, all achieved on par-70 courses. His 15-stroke margin of victory also surpassed the 13-shot record margin set by Old Tom Morris at the 1862 Open Championship at Prestwick and remains the largest in a major championship.\nAmateurs: Wilson (+20)\n\"Full final leaderboard\"\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nImpact.\nTiger Woods would go on to win four majors in a row, the first player since Bobby Jones to simultaneously hold all four major championship titles, otherwise referred to as the \"Tiger Slam\". The year 2000 is often regarded as the pinnacle of Woods's career.\nIn a 2011 piece for the ESPN outlet \"Grantland.com\", writer Bill Barnwell argued that Woods' performance at the 2000 U.S. Open was statistically the most dominant by any major championship winner since 1960. When compared to the performance of all golfers who completed four rounds in that event, Woods' score of 272 was 4.12 standard deviations better than the mean of the field he competed against—more than half a standard deviation better than the winner of any other major in that period."

        "text": "The 1990 U.S. Open was the 90th U.S. Open, held June 14–18 at Course No. 3 of Medinah Country Club in Medinah, Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago. Hale Irwin became the oldest U.S. Open champion by defeating Mike Donald at the 91st hole, the first in sudden-death, after the two tied in the 18-hole Monday It was Irwin's third U.S. Open title, with previous wins in 1974 and 1979. Implemented decades earlier, it was the first use of sudden-death in the U.S. Open; the last tie in a playoff was in 1946. Sudden death was needed again in 1994 and 2008.\nIt was the third U.S. Open at Medinah, which previously hosted in 1949 and 1975. It later hosted the PGA Championship in 1999 and 2006, and the Ryder Cup in 2012.\nIrwin was without a PGA Tour win in five years and 11 years removed from his last U.S. Open victory in 1979; he received a special exemption from the USGA to enter the tournament. Irwin began the final round in a tie for 20th place, four strokes back of leaders Billy Ray Brown and Donald. Playing well ahead of the leaders, Irwin fired a round of 67, which included a birdie putt at the 72nd hole. After the putt dropped, he provided the championship with its enduring image as he took a \"victory lap\" around the green, high-fiving spectators. Irwin, however, had not won the championship yet as there were still golfers on the course with a chance to overtake him. Donald made par saves from on the 12th and from on the 14th before making bogey at the 16th. A two-putt par on the last tied him with Irwin, forcing an 18-hole Monday playoff. Brown and Nick Faldo finished a stroke out of the playoff in a tie for third place.\nIn the playoff, Donald took a two-shot lead to the 16th tee. Needing a birdie, Irwin responded with a brilliant 2-iron approach and sank the putt to get within one. After both players parred the 17th, Irwin made par at the last, giving Donald a chance to win the championship. His par putt, however, narrowly slid by, implementing sudden-death for the first time in U.S. Open history. (Previous playoff ties went on to play additional full rounds, the last of which was in 1946.) Irwin needed just one more hole, recording a birdie at the par-4 1st to win the championship.\nAt , Irwin became the oldest winner of the U.S. Open, surpassing the record set in 1986 by Raymond Floyd by 15 months. The oldest winner of a major is Phil Mickelson, 50 at the 2021 PGA Championship.\nCurtis Strange attempted to win his third consecutive U.S. Open; he began the final round just two off the lead, but a final round 75 dropped him back to 21st place. Amateurs Phil Mickelson and David Duval made their major championship debuts, finishing in 29th and 56th place, respectively.\nScoring conditions were ideal throughout the week, with a record 39 under-par rounds in the first round and 47 in the second.

It was the second tour of Argentina by England and was apparently arranged without the tour manager Geoff Cooke's knowledge and at an inconvenient time of the year for the England players in July and August. For this reason, eight England players declined the invitation to make the trip, and the only seasoned internationals on the tour were Will Carling, Richard Hill, Wade Dooley, Brian Moore, Jeff Probyn and Peter Winterbottom.\nIt was also notable in that it was the first series between Argentina and a Home Nation since 1981, as the Home Nations were prohibited from playing Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War in 1982 and represented a start of a warming period of relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina.\nMatch details.\nComplete list of matches played in Argentina:"

From 23 May 1944, during the final preparations for D-Day, the base was completely sealed. During the base's operation, she was assigned a number of depot ships. The first was the \"Nab Happy Lass\", from the time of commissioning until 30 April 1945.

A total of 43 fencers from 9 nations competed in the event, which was held on August 25 and August 26, 1920. Nations were limited to eight fencers each. The event was won by Nedo Nadi of Italy, one of his five gold medals in 1920. His brother Aldo Nadi took silver. Adrianus de Jong of the Netherlands finished third. They were the first medals in the individual men's sabre for both countries. This was the only time from 1908 to 1964 that Hungary did not win the men's sabre—with no Hungarian fencers competing after the nation was disinvited after World War I.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Seven of the eight finalists from 1912 had been Hungarian; with Hungary not invited to the 1920 Games in the aftermath of World War I, none of those seven could return. The other finalist, however, was Nedo Nadi of Italy—the heavy favorite with no Hungarians competing (and with 1919 Inter-Allied champion Vincent Gillens of Belgium not attending either).\nCzechoslovakia made its debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their fourth appearance in the event, tying Austria (also not invited to the Games following the war) for most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a three-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to three touches (an unpopular change from the more typical five). Standard sabre rules were used, including that the target area was the now-standard target above the waist (in contrast to the larger target in 1912 and the whole body in 1896, 1900, and 1908)."

        "text": "BAE Warton RUFC is a rugby club based in Warton, Fylde, England.\nHistory.\nThe Club originally appeared as a Wednesday side running for a while in the 1980s, using players from surrounding clubs, and playing mid-week social games. BAE Warton RUFC in its own right was formed in 1992. The club was affiliated to the RFU in 1992 and went on to join the then Courage League in 1994, playing in division Lancs North Two. Though not without its successes in the league, the club was forced to withdraw from the Courage league following the 1996/1997 season, when injuries and lack of depth to the squad were preventing the club competing at the required level. For the 1997/1998 season the club resumed with a schedule of friendly games against junior sides (with one or two exceptions) at clubs throughout Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria.\nWith the pressure of competing in the league removed, the club continued to flourish, albeit fairly static in terms of growth, but with a steady influx of new blood replacing retirees and players leaving the Club due to work commitments. This continued until the season 2002/2003, when the retirement of several key players at the end of the previous season seriously weakened the squad. Slowly, the corner was turned, and with the steady arrival of new players during 2003 and 2004, the Club found itself in its strongest position in terms of personnel for many years. Along with the upturn in numbers playing and training for the club, the standard of rugby improved, due in no small part to the efforts of our past and present coaches, allowing a return to league rugby for the first time since 1997.\nAfter a brief spell in Divisions 3 and 4, the Club found itself, midway through the 2010/11 Season, languishing in mid-table of Division 5 (North) of the re-branded North West Intermediate Rugby Union Leagues when a change of management and an influx of new players re-invigorated the club. The re-focused squad enjoyed a transformation of fortunes and gained promotion at the end of the season out of the league's basement and into Division 4 (North).\nA record breaking season in 2012/13 saw the Club promoted for a second successive year, but this time as Champions and with an astonishing 1000+ points difference, into Division 3 (North). After enjoying two back to back promotions, few expected the club to progress any further. This wasn't to be the case as Warton enjoyed another successful season finishing as runners up just one point behind Preston Grasshoppers. Thereby ensuring the team had achieved three back to back promotions.\nFacilities.\nHome matches are played at Bank Lane sports ground in Warton, Training is held on a flood-lit all-weather pitch during the Winter months and post-match hospitality provided at the Coach &amp; Horses in Freckleton - and new players are always welcome."

The swimming events at the 1896 Olympic Games were held in a bay in the Aegean Sea with swimmers being required to swim to the shore—Hungarian swimmer Alfréd Hajós won two gold medals that year, saying \"My will to live completely overcame my desire to win.\" The 1900 Summer Olympic Games in Paris had the swimming events take place in the River Seine, and the events at the 1908 Summer Olympics were held in a 100-metre pool surrounded by an athletics track in the White City Stadium in London.\nRaces are held in four swimming categories: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly, over varying distances and in either individual or relay race events. Medley swimming races are also held, both individually and in relays, in which all four swimming categories are used. In the Swimming at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, both men and women competed in eighteen events in the pool. Of the 35 pool-based events, swimmers from the United States hold fourteen records, Australia seven, China four, Hungary three, Great Britain and South Africa two each, and one each to Ukraine, Russian Olympic Committee and Sweden.

        "text": "G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki (), is a professional volleyball team based in Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece. It plays in A1 Greek Volleyball League. Founded in the 1920s, they evolved in one of the most successful departments of G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki multi-sports club and one of the best teams in Greece and Europe, as they have won 5 times the Greek league (2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012) and reached 3 times (2005, 2006, 2009) the final of the CEV Champions League.\nHistory.\nIraklis was one of the first Greek clubs which encouraged volleyball before World War II. After the war, they were always among the top teams in Greece. The first national championship was played in 1968 and Iraklis was also able to contribute to the National Teams with plenty of players. During the 70's, Iraklis participated twice in the championship finals, due to the contribution of Nikos Antoniadis. In 1987, 1989 and 1992 Iraklis made it to the European Cup and in 1997 came the outburst of the team.\nThanks to an organized effort, Iraklis played three consecutive Championship finals and finally won its first title -the Greek Cup- in 2000. Two years later, the team won both the Championship and the Cup titles, while finishing third in the CEV Champions League final-four held in Opole, Poland.\nThe next four years Iraklis dominated in Greece, confirming his superiority by winning one Championship (2005), three Greek Cups (2004, 2005, 2006) and two Greek Super Cups (2004, 2005), but mostly by participating in three more CEV Champions League final-fours. In 2004 in Belgorod, Russia, the team finished in the fourth place. Next year, the presence of world-class players such as Lloy Ball, Thomas Hoff and Clayton Stanley helped the team to reach the final-four which took place in Thessaloniki, Greece. Iraklis beat Lokomotiv Belgorod in the semi-final, but lost 1-3 to Tours VB in the final, despite the outstanding support by the fans. In 2006, Iraklis made it again to the final in Rome, Italy, to be beaten by Sisley Treviso 3-1. About 4,000 Iraklis fans traveled to Rome to support the team.\nThe following season marked the beginning of a transitional period. Many of the top players were released from the team, while the budget was cut in half. Even so, the team's dominance in Greece continued. In 2007, Iraklis finished third in regular season, but managed to win the Championship beating Olympiacos S.C. in the semi-finals and Panathinaikos VC in the finals, having both times a disadvantage. The next Championship (2007–08) had the same conclusion. Iraklis defeated Panathinaikos VC in the finals without losing a single game and won the championship for the fourth time in their history.\nHonours.\nDomestic.\nGreek League\nGreek Cup\nGreek Super Cup\nGreek A2 League\nEuropean.\nCEV Champions League"

        "title": "1941 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1941 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the ninth playing of the mid-summer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 8, 1941, at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, Michigan, the home of the Detroit Tigers of the American League.\nResult and key moments.\nThe American League defeated the National League, 7–5. With the NL leading 5–4, two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and Joe Gordon and Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees on base; Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox hit a walk-off home run off of Claude Passeau of the Chicago Cubs to win it for the AL.\nPrior to Williams' at-bat DiMaggio hit a potential game-ending double play groundball. However, Billy Herman’s relay throw pulled first baseman Frank McCormick off the bag, thus extending the game and setting up Williams' at-bat.\nIn the end, the AL's dramatic 7–5 walk-off win overshadowed two home runs hit by Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Arky Vaughan, which had given the NL 3–2 and 5–2 leads in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nUmpires.\nThe umpires changed assignments in the middle of the fifth inning – Summers and Pinelli swapped positions, also Jorda and Grieve swapped positions.\nGame summary.\nBob Feller (Cleveland, AL) and Whit Wyatt (Brooklyn, NL) pitched three and two scoreless innings, respectively, to start the game. Neither team put a runner in scoring position until the fourth inning, when doubles by Cecil Travis (Washington) and Ted Williams off Paul Derringer (Cincinnati) put the AL ahead 1–0.\nBucky Waters (Cincinnati) led off the sixth inning with a double. A bunt by Stan Hack (Chicago Cubs) moved Waters to third and a sacrifice fly by Terry Moore (St. Louis Cardinals) tied the game at 1–1.\nThe AL answered in the bottom half of the same inning when Cleveland shortstop Lou Boudreau (who had entered the game for Joe Cronin) singled home Joe DiMaggio for a 2–1 AL lead.\nThe top halves of the seventh and eighth innings saw the heroics of Arky Vaughan, who hit a two-run home run in each to also score two St. Louis Cardinals players: Enos Slaughter, who had opened the seventh inning with a single, and Johnny Mize, who had preceded Vaughan's round-tripper in the eighth with a one-out double.\nWith the score now 5–2 in favor of the National League the first pair of brothers to ever appear together in an All-Star Game cut into the NL lead, when Dom DiMaggio – in his first plate appearance of the game – singled home Joe after his one-out double.\nIn the ninth inning, White Sox pitcher Eddie Smith, who had given up one of Vaughan's home runs, retired the NL in order in his second inning of work. One of the three NL hitters to step to the plate that half-inning was pitcher Claude Passeau, who – with his team leading 5–3 – was not pulled for a pinch hitter, and thus returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth for his third inning of work. (The only position player left on the NL bench, Cookie Lavagetto, was inserted as a pinch hitter one batter after Passeau's at-bat.)\nWith one out in the bottom of the ninth, three consecutive AL batters reached base, putting the tying and go-ahead runs on base and bringing Joe DiMaggio to the plate. The “Yankee Clipper” then hit what some sources describe as a routine double-play groundball, which would have ended the ballgame. However, the relay throw from second to first by Billy Herman pulled first baseman Frank McCormick off the bag and extended the game.\nWith the NL still leading 5–4 (a run had scored on DiMaggio's groundout), the AL now had the tying run on third and the winning run on first. Not electing to walk Ted Williams, which would have advanced the winning run to second base and brought Dom DiMaggio to the plate, NL manager Bill McKechnie let Passeau pitch to Williams. With the count two balls and one strike Williams hit a three-run home run off the third deck of the right field stands of Detroit's Briggs Stadium for a 7–5 American League victory.\nContext and aftermath.\nThe 1941 All-Star Game took place in the midst of Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak (but did not count towards it, as the All-Star Game is regarded as an exhibition game). DiMaggio had equaled the all-time record of 44 games, set by Willie Keeler in 1897, seven days prior to the All-Star Game and broken it the day after that (July 1 and 2, respectively). The streak would end nine days after the All-Star Game, when DiMaggio went hitless on July 17 against the Cleveland Indians.\nTed Williams, whose batting average was at .405 at the time of the All-Star Game, would even slightly improve on that hitting pace for the rest of the season and end the 1941 campaign at .406, making him the last hitter to reach the .400 mark for a season.\nThe 1941 Major League Baseball season, of which the All-Star Game marked the midway point, was the last played prior to the United States' entry into World War II. The juxtaposition of that memorable season taking place with the war looming is illustrated in the 1991 book \"Baseball in ’41\" by renowned sportswriter Robert Creamer. Although the Major League season and the World Series would continue to be played during the war years, the All-Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to wartime travel restrictions.\nThe fact that Arky Vaughan was eventually denied the accolades of being the player of the game despite his two home runs can be seen as symbolic of his entire career: Despite arguably being the preeminent offensive shortstop of his time, hitting .300 or higher in 12 of his 14 Major League seasons, Vaughan was not inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1985 (posthumously, by the Veterans Committee, nearly four decades after his last major league appearance) and is not remembered as vividly as many of the other stars of this era."

Within two weeks and three days, seven matches were to be played, the first four at sea level, and the final three, including the Test Match, at the altitude in the highveld with only two days to acclimatise before a demanding fixture against Northern Transvaal. From the outset, under captain John Pullin and the management of Alec Lewis and John Elders, there was a buoyant and optimistic spirit in the squad, as if they were determined to erase the memories of the last few seasons of undistinguished English performances.\nApartheid backdrop and controversy.\nThe tour took place against the backdrop of widespread condemnation of the apartheid regime. Under pressure from other African nations, the International Olympic Committee had excluded South Africa from competing in the Summer Games since 1964, and there had also been protests against visiting sporting teams from South Africa.\nIn 1971, an international cricket boycott was instituted against South Africa to voice global disapproval of their selection policies and apartheid in general. South Africa subsequently became a world sporting pariah, and were excluded from the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, test cricket, and a host of other sports. \nThere were protests against the 1972 England rugby tour, including a blockade of their hotel to try to prevent them leaving, in which 14 people were arrested.\nTest Match.\nPiet Greyling led a combination of Springboks who seemed hopelessly unsure of themselves. Dawie Snyman collected all the South African points with three penalties while England, with unspectacular competence, grabbed every scoring chance. Fullback Sam Doble converted a try by wing Alan Morley and also booted four penalties."

They won four of the seven matches but lost both of the test matches as well as drawing the fixture against Western Province.\nEngland's decision to take part in the tour drew public criticism, and was the subject of covert political pressure, partly due to the prevailing apartheid system in South Africa. The Council of the Rugby Football Union voted in favour of the tour proceeding by 44 votes to 6. Although only Ralph Knibbs of Bristol made opposition to apartheid his reason, many other top players were also unable to tour, and the squad was relatively inexperienced. 10 of the 26 players were uncapped before the tour and 7 gained their first caps in South Africa."

One day later they found the bodies of a 46-year-old woman and her three children. Police suspected that Lee and the woman had been in a relationship. Lee had apparently borrowed the equivalent of $250,000. He was unable to pay the money back, and police speculated that this was the motive of the killings. Police said their details about the case were still sketchy because there was no suicide note, but Lee was seen on security video removing four large black duffel bags from the woman's apartment late one evening. He was also put at the scene by a witness who saw him in the parking lot about the time that the woman and her daughters went missing."

        "title": "Bob King (basketball)",
        "text": "Bob King (August 24, 1923 – December 10, 2004) was a college basketball coach and administrator. He was head coach at the University of New Mexico from 1962 to 1972 and at Indiana State University from 1975 to 1978. He also served as Assistant Athletics Director at New Mexico (1972–73) and Athletics Director at Indiana State (1974–80).\nKing coached basketball Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Mel Daniels, and Don Nelson. The success of his New Mexico teams led to the construction of The Pit, the home venue of the Lobos, and its court is named after him. He also assembled the Indiana State team that went to the 1979 NCAA Final Four and lost in the championship game. Both schools have inducted King into their Athletics Halls of Fame, as has the Missouri Valley Conference.\nEarly career.\nKing was born in Gravity, Iowa, where he was an All-State basketball player in high school. He lettered in baseball as a freshman at the University of Iowa before graduating in three years with a bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1947. He earned a master's degree in Educational Guidance and Psychology from Drake University in 1957. King coached for 12 seasons at Britt High School and Algona High School in Iowa and Rockford West High School in Rockford, Illinois. King led Rockford West to three consecutive Regional championships from 1957 to 1959, while compiling an overall high school record of 205–75. King then returned to his alma mater and became an assistant coach at Iowa for two seasons (1960–62) under Sharm Scheuerman. At Iowa, King coached two-time All-American, NBA player and Hall of Fame coach Don Nelson, who became the all-time leader in NBA coaching victories.\nUniversity of New Mexico.\nKing was hired as head coach of the New Mexico Lobos in 1962. The Lobo program had gone 42–149 (.220) over the previous eight seasons and had only two winning seasons in the previous fifteen years. King transformed the program immediately, winning more games in his first two seasons than the team had won in the previous six combined. In ten seasons as Lobo head coach, King compiled a record of 175–89 (.663), the second most coaching wins in team history, with two Western Athletic Conference (WAC) titles, three appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), and the school's first NCAA tournament bid.\nKing instilled fundamental principles of the game, running a disciplined offense and a relentless, pressure defense, building his early teams around dominant centers. His first Lobo squad was led by future ABA-standout Ira Harge, who transferred to New Mexico from a Junior College in Iowa. The Lobos went 16–9 in their first season under King. In 1963–64, they won the WAC championship for the first time and went to the NIT in New York City. They defeated Drake and upset NYU before losing in the championship game to Bradley, finishing the season 23–6, the most wins in program history at that point. Harge averaged 19 points and 12 rebounds as a Lobo and was honored as \"the most prolific scorer in the history of the school\" at the time.\nKing next signed center Mel Daniels, one of the greatest players in Lobo history. Daniels averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds a game as a three-year starter (1964–67), leading the team to a combined 54–24 record and two more NIT appearances. Daniels went on to become an ABA All-Time Team member after winning two MVP awards and three championships with the Indiana Pacers. In 2012, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. After his playing career, Daniels joined King's staff at Indiana State as an assistant, and he later worked in the Pacers front office for over twenty years.\nThe Lobos entered the national rankings for the first time and spent a total of 52 weeks in the rankings during King's tenure. The team became wildly popular in Albuquerque, attendance at their games more than doubled, and soon their home venue was selling out regularly. University Arena, now formally known as Dreamstyle Arena but popularly known as \"The Pit\", opened at the beginning of the 1966–67 season and has become one of the most renowned college basketball arenas in the country. Attendance at The Pit was second in the nation in its first year and has remained among national leaders ever since, and the Lobos have won over eighty percent of their games there.\nDuring the same period, Lobo rivals UTEP and New Mexico State also attained national prominence. UTEP (then Texas Western) won the national championship in 1966, and New Mexico State reached the Final Four in 1970. A fierce rivalry developed among King, Miners coach Don Haskins, and Aggies coach Lou Henson. Their teams each played one another twice a season, often with national rankings at stake.\nThe 1967–68 Lobos had lost Daniels to graduation, and they were picked in preseason polls to finish last in the WAC. Instead they bolted to a 17–0 start, climbing into the national rankings. The team was the most balanced squad King had at New Mexico, with four players averaging in double-figures, led by Ron Nelson with 19.5 points per game. The Lobos beat #5 Utah and #10 New Mexico State, surging to #4 in the polls. They won the WAC conference, and Nelson was honored as All-WAC and a Helms All-American. The Lobos received their first bid to the NCAA tournament, playing in the regionals at The Pit. They were upset by Santa Clara, however, and finished the season 23–5.\nThe focus on inside play returned the next season as Willie Long began his run as a three-year starter. The team finished 17–9 but failed to reach the post-season. Long averaged 23.9 points a game in both his final two seasons, earning All-WAC recognition both years and Helms All-American status as a senior. Like Harge and Daniels, Long went on to play in the ABA. The Lobos slumped to a 42–36 record in King's final three seasons as head coach, with no postseason appearances.\nKing stepped down as coach after the 1971–72 season, becoming Assistant Athletics Director at UNM the next year. He had hoped to take over as Athletics Director, as the current AD was set to retire in 1973, but after he was passed over for the job, perhaps due to state politics, King resigned.\nIndiana State University.\nKing was hired as Athletics Director at Indiana State, serving from 1974 to 1980, transforming the program and leading it to national prominence. Under King the ISU football program elevated to Division I status, and the school joined the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The men's gymnastics team was NCAA co-champion in 1977, producing Olympian Kurt Thomas, and four-time Olympic medalist Bruce Baumgartner wrestled for the ISU team.\nKing was head coach of the ISU basketball team for three seasons, from 1975 through 1978. King and assistant coach Bill Hodges recruited Larry Bird, who had started school the previous year at Indiana University but quit before basketball season began. Bird had been working for the public works department in his hometown, among other odd jobs, while also playing in AAU league games and tournaments. Hodges was persistent, showing up at Bird's house and jobs, trying to convince him to return to college ball. King and Hodges went to see Bird play in an AAU all-star game. King noticed scratches on Bird's arms and correctly guessed that he had been putting up hay all day. Bird finished with 43 points and 25 rebounds, and King convinced him to visit ISU for a tryout. Bird enrolled for the fall semester but sat out the 1975–76 season due to NCAA transfer rules. The Sycamores went 13–12. Bird practiced with the team, and rumors began to circulate that the red-shirt squad was beating the starters.\nBird began his ISU career year with a flourish, scoring over 30 points in his first games, later scoring 47 points with 19 rebounds against Butler. The Sycamores had joined the MVC but were not eligible for the conference title, and they dominated a schedule of mostly independents. Bird averaged 32.8 points and 13.3 rebounds a game, leading the team to a 25–2 regular season record. Sports Illustrated put him on its cover and called him \"College Basketball’s Secret Weapon.\" Attendance surged and ISU recorded its first ever sold-out home games. The Sycamores were ranked #16 and received their first post-season invitation as a Division I school, playing at Houston in the NIT. They lost in the closing seconds, 83–82, despite 44 points and 14 boards from Bird, finishing the season 25–3.\nThe Sycamores began the 1977–78 season 13–0, including a blowout over Purdue. They then lost five straight, struggling on the road in the MVC. The team finished the season strong, winning eight out of ten but losing at Creighton in the conference tournament final. They again received a bid to the NIT, where they beat Illinois State in the first round before losing at Rutgers, 57–56, finishing the season 23–9. Bird averaged 30 points and 11.5 rebounds and was named a first team UPI All-American.\nShortly before practices for the 1978–79 season started, King suffered a heart attack followed by a brain aneurysm and was forced to relinquish his coaching duties. Hodges took over, but King continued to contribute as the coaches met regularly during the season. Hodges especially valued King's input on defense, where his innovative scheme was later adopted by Bob Knight at Indiana. The team completed its pre-conference schedule undefeated, including a win at eventual Big Ten champion Purdue, and they climbed into the national rankings. Early in the conference season, Hodges had become frustrated with opponents breaking the ISU press and asked King to attend practice. King recommended an adjustment that led to immediate improvement and a series of tough conference wins.\nKing could have returned to the sidelines at some point, but he continued to have short-term memory problems. He attended most Sycamore home games but was not up to traveling. He made an exception for the MVC road game to New Mexico State, where he still had a number of friends. The game, played before a record crowd in Las Cruces, turned out to be one of the biggest scares of the season for the Sycamores. Bird and two other starters fouled out, and the Aggies held a two-point lead with time running out. ISU sixth man Bob Heaton hit a half court desperation shot at the buzzer to send the game into overtime, and the Sycamores edged the Aggies in the extra period. ISU players hoisted Hodges onto their shoulders in celebration, but he reached down and embraced King.\nThe Sycamores rose to #1 in the national rankings and completed the regular season 26–0. Bird averaged 28.6 points, 14.9 rebounds, and 5.5 assists a game. Junior PG Carl Nicks added 19.3 points and five assists a game. King had encouraged Nicks to transfer to a junior college for his sophomore season to hone his game, and the strategy had paid off. (As a senior the next season, Nicks averaged 26.8 points a game, and he later played professionally for several years.) ISU swept through the MVC tournament, winning the championship game over New Mexico State.\nThe Sycamores received a one-seed in the NCAA tournament . They beat Virginia Tech and Oklahoma handily, then edged #5 Arkansas to reach the Final Four. They beat #6 DePaul in the semi-final game, advancing to the NCAA championship game against #3 Michigan State at 33–0. The Spartans were led by Magic Johnson, and the game became one of the most memorable finals in NCAA basketball history, sparking a surge of interest in the NCAA tournament. The Spartans won, and Bird and Johnson continued their intense rivalry over the next decade in the NBA.\nHodges was named National Coach of the Year. He honored King, stating, \"The two greatest things a man can give another are knowledge and a chance. Bob King gave me both.\" Former New Mexico great Mel Daniels was also an assistant coach on the ISU staff. Years later, Daniels, Bird, and Nicks would be reunited on the coaching staff and front office of the Indiana Pacers.\nKing continued as ISU Athletics Director until he retired in 1980. He compiled a head coaching record of 61–24 (.718) at ISU, the third best winning percentage in school history (John Wooden is first at .746), and the eighth most coaching wins. King was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2014.\nRetirement.\nIn thirteen seasons as a head coach, King compiled an overall record of 236–113 (.676), taking five teams to the NIT and one team to the NCAA Tournament. His teams won over 20 games four times, and he never had a losing season in his career.\nIn 1981 King returned to New Mexico, where he lived in Albuquerque and Belen and regularly attended Lobo games at The Pit. He was inducted into the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame in 1982 and the University of New Mexico Athletics Hall of Honor in 1987. In a formal ceremony on December 1, 1992, the basketball court at The Pit was dedicated and named Bob King Court in honor of the man known as the “Architect of Lobo Basketball.”\nKing died in Albuquerque on December 10, 2004, survived by his wife, four sons, and two daughters. A public memorial service was held at The Pit, attended by hundreds of mourners and former players, including Bird, Daniels, Harge, and Ron Nelson. Nelson praised King for his integrity and discipline, qualities he instilled in his players. Daniels and Harge credited King for caring about his players and teaching them life lessons beyond the game. Daniels noted how King had taught him to prepare, on the court and in the classroom, and that he treated his players with respect, which they readily returned. Harge stated, \"Bob King did more for me than anybody in my life.\" Bird said King \"was instrumental in the success of my career. I will always be grateful for his friendship, guidance, and help. Coach King was more than a coach; he was a dear friend and mentor.\""

Following the success of the Northern Union's first season, several more clubs from the established Rugby Football Union joined the rebel competition. This resulted in the decision that for the 1896–97 season the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire. This season also saw the introduction of the Challenge Cup, with Batley defeating St Helens in the inaugural final.\nSeason summary.\nEight new teams joined the twenty-two teams already in the breakaway Northern Union, and so it was split into two county leagues for the 1896–97 season. The new teams were Bramley, Castleford, Heckmondwike, Holbeck, Leeds Parish Church, Morecambe, Swinton and Salford. Salford's first game was a 10-0 defeat away to Widnes on 5 September 1896.\nMr J.E. Warren of the Warrington club was elected as the new President of the Northern Union. Warren, previously Warrington's secretary, had played a key role in Warrington's involvement in the foundation of the Northern Union.\nThe leading try scorer overall this season was Hannah of Hunslet, who crossed the line 19 times. The leading goal kickers were Albert Goldthorpe of Hunslet and Sharpe of Liversedge who both successful 26 times. The leading points scorer was Archie Rigg of Halifax with 112 points.\nLancashire Senior Competition.\nAfter finishing second from the bottom of the competition in the previous season, Broughton Rangers made a remarkable turnaround to finish the 1896–97 competition at the top of the Lancashire division, just one competition point ahead of Oldham, who had won more matches and had a better points differential. Although participating in the Lancashire Senior Competition, Runcorn and Stockport were from Cheshire.\nSource: \"R.L.Yearbook 1995–96 cited in \"The Vault\"\".\nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nPld = Games played; W = Wins; D = Draws; L = Losses; PF = Match points scored; PA = Match points conceded; PD = Points difference; Pts = League points.\nYorkshire Senior Competition.\nThe previous season's champions, Manningham continued their good form in the Northern Union's second season, finishing in second place.

        "text": "The 2008–09 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represented Duke University in the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team's head coach was Mike Krzyzewski, who served for his 29th year. The team played its home games in Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina. The Blue Devils captured the ACC Championship by defeating Florida State in the championship game in Atlanta.\nPre-season.\nThe 2007–08 Duke Blue Devils finished the season 28–6 (13–3), placed second in the ACC regular season standings, and lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Earlier in the season, the squad reached as high as #2 in the Coaches' Poll with only one loss. Some late season losses caused them to finish the regular season ranked #9 in the country and #2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Duke then lost in the semifinals in the ACC tournament to the Clemson Tigers. Duke was given a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. After narrowly defeating #15 Belmont, Duke lost 73–67 to the #7 West Virginia Mountaineers.\nRecruiting.\nOn September 26, 2007, forward Olek Czyz committed to Duke University. Czyz is a 6–7 Poland native who has spent the last three years in Reno, Nevada. Both Scout and Rivals.com listed him as the 27th best power forward in the nation. However, Scout.com had him 80th overall, while Rivals.com had him back at 102nd. As a junior at Reno High School, Czyz averaged 18.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, leading Reno to a 24–6 record. In his sophomore year, Olek had a ten-point and six rebound average, while leading his team to a state championship. Other schools to make offers to Czyz were Arizona State, Colorado State, Florida, Kentucky, Louisville, Nevada, Pepperdine, and Washington State.\nOn the first day of November, the Blue Devils received a commitment from Elliot Williams. The 6–4 shooting guard from Memphis, Tennessee was listed as the number 3 shooting guard in the country by Rivals.com, while Scout.com had him as the number 4 shooting guard and the number 14 overall prospect in the country. Williams spent high school at St. George's where he averaged 25 points, seven rebounds, and six assists per game. In his junior year, Elliot averaged 22 points and six rebounds per contest, while leading his team to a state championship. Williams turned down offers from Clemson, Memphis, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, and Virginia.\nPower forward Miles Plumlee, a 6–10 native of Warsaw, Indiana, who attended high school in Arden, North Carolina, committed to the Blue Devils on May 1, 2008. Miles, who is the older brother of 2009 commitment Mason Plumlee, had signed a letter of intent to Stanford University, but after head coach Trent Johnson took the coaching job at Louisiana State, Plumlee requested and was granted a release. Plumlee is rated as the 17th best power forward of the 2008 recruiting class by Scouts.com, while Rivals has him ranked 29th at forward and 101st overall.\nOffseason changes.\nThe only senior Duke lost from their 2007–08 squad was DeMarcus Nelson who graduated. Nelson was projected to go somewhere in the late second round in the 2008 NBA draft, but instead went undrafted. On September 9, 2008, Nelson was signed by the Golden State Warriors.\nJoe Alleva, the Duke Athletics Director, interviewed for the athletics director job at Louisiana State on April 1, and was offered for the position on April 3. After 10 years as Duke's athletics director, Alleva took the job and is scheduled to start on July 1. At Duke a twelve-person committee, assembled by Duke President, Richard H. Brodhead, searched for a new athletics director. Joe Alleva said in an interview that he would do anything to help in the search. On May 30, Brodhead announced that the Duke had hired former Notre Dame athletics director Kevin White. Coach Mike Krzyzewski said the White \"is one of the most respected people in intercollegiate athletics\" and brings \" wealth of experience and is someone who people admire\".\nDuke forward Taylor King decided to transfer to Villanova University in April 2008. As a freshman at Duke, King played in all 34 games, averaging 5.9 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. He had 43 three-pointers that season, putting him eighth all-time against Duke freshmen. When announcing his transfer, King told reporters \"Nothing against Duke, but it's time for a change. I needed to explore other places. Villanova is a true family atmosphere where everyone's got each other's back.\" Per NCAA regulations, King will have to sit out a season.\nOn April 26, associate head coach Johnny Dawkins announced that he would be leaving the Blue Devils, to take over the head coaching spot at Stanford. Dawkins was a member of the 1986 Duke team that lost in the finals to Louisville. After nine seasons in the NBA, Dawkins was hired as an assistant coach during the 1998–99 season. Two years later he was promoted to associate head coach, a job he's held for nine years.\nIt was announced on May 5, that Nate James would replace Johnny Dawkins as an assistant coach. James was a captain on the 2000-01 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team that won a national championship.

There were 10 boats (90 competitors) from 10 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the Netherlands, the nation's first victory in the men's eight and first medal of any color in the event since 1900. Germany took silver; it was the 9th time in the past 10 Games that a German team (Germany, United Team of Germany, East Germany, or West Germany) was on the podium, with the only exception being 1984 when no German boats competed. Russia earned bronze in its independent debut.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nOf the 10 nations competing, five had won medals in top-level competition in the last four years. Canada was the reigning Olympic champion, though it had not been on a World Championship podium since. Germany, the 1992 Olympic bronze winners, had taken gold at the 1993 and 1995 World Championships. The 1994 World Champion was the United States, which had also earned bronze in 1993 and 1995. Dutch crews had been runners-up in 1994 and 1995. Romania had taken silver at the 1992 Olympics and 1993 World Championship, as well as bronze in 1994.\nRussia and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 19th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nThe competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals) as well as a repechage. "

While at the \"U\" Hawkins earned a degree in Finance, with a B average.\nIn his four years at Miami the Hurricanes had a 44-4 win–loss record and Hawkins played in four \"New Years' Day\" bowl games: a January 1, 1986, 35-7 loss to the University of Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl; a January 2, 1987, 14-10 loss to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl; a 20-14 win over the University of Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1988, and a 23-3 win over the University of Nebraska on January 2, 1989 in the Orange Bowl. The Hurricanes were National Champions after the 1987 season and the victory over Oklahoma.\nHawkins is a member of the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nHawkins measured 6'6 1/18\" and 260 pounds at the NFL Combine. Had a \"superb showing\" at the combine. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.73. Was described as a \"Polished player with 5 years experience on one of nation's top teams. Very intelligent. Positive influence on teammates. Type of lineman who would adapt well to the many adjustments.\" Was reported to have good quickness and leaping ability along with a good \"closing burst\" and \"good upper-body strength and runs well for a big guy\" \nLos Angeles Rams.\nHawkins was the 21st selection in the 1st round of the 1989 NFL draft and was the 5th defensive end chosen, behind Burt Grossman (San Diego Chargers), Trace Armstrong (Chicago Bears), Jeff Lageman (New York Jets), and Wayne Martin (New Orleans Saints). Rams Coach John Robinson stated, \"Bill is the kind of player that can develop into a big-time pass rusher, the kind of player we've talked about getting but could not find\".\nAfter a prolonged holdout Hawkins signed a reported four-year, $1.9-million contract that included a $750,000 signing bonus on August 18, 1989.\nHe played in 13 games, starting 1, as a rookie and was voted All-Rookie despite missing the final three games with a left knee injury. Finished season with 11 tackles with a high of 6 against the Dallas Cowboys on December 3, 1989. He also forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Larry Kelm securing the 35-31 win.\nIn 1990 Hawkins played in 15 games without a start. He was slow to recover from his knee injury which ended his 1989 season. He played mostly defensive tackle in the Rams \"Eagle\" defense, which was a pass rush scheme. In that role Hawkins made 9 tackles and 3 sacks, with 2 of the sacks coming against the Atlanta Falcons on December 23, 1990. He also batted away two passes in 1990. Hawkins also began pursuing a law degree in 1990.\nInjuries and an incompatible defensive style reduced contributions in his first two seasons. \"Bill is consistently improving\", coach John Robinson said of Hawkins. \"He came into (1991) camp really light. We hope he gains weight. His improvement has been very gradual\". Hawkins was on injured reserve for 10 games in 1991 and played in only six games as a backup defensive end in the Rams new 4-3 pressure defensive scheme (installed by new defensive coordinator Jeff Fisher), recording 4 tackles for the season and one fumble recovery. Back and rib injuries were the reasons Hawkins missed time in 1991.\nWith the arrival of new Head Coach Chuck Knox and yet a new defensive scheme Hawkins earned the starting right defensive end spot. Despite suffering a torn calf muscle on August 6, 1992, Hawkins held the starting job for the first half of the season until he injured his knee on November 8, 1992, which ended his season. An MRI revealed he suffered damage to the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and underwent major reconstructive surgery. In 1992, in 8 games (7 starts), Hawkins recorded 15 tackles and 2 sacks and batted down 2 passes.\nHe attempted to come back from knee surgery in 1993 but failed to make the team. On April 27, 1993, he signed a new contract (he was a free agent) but during training camp he was cut. Due to injuries to other Rams defensive linemen he was activated on August 25, 1993. Hawkins participated in his first practice since undergoing knee surgery in November, 1992, and said his knee felt \"pretty good\". However, Hawkins' career, ended on August 31, 1993, when Chuck Knox informed him that his services were no longer required.\nJupiter High School.\nIn the 2010–2011 season he coached the defensive line for the varsity team."

This joint venture lasted for three seasons before disbanding, with North Melbourne continuing in the association on its own.\nGeelong was re-admitted as a single entity prior to the 1993/94 season with Michael King as Club President, and former North Melbourne, St. Kilda, South Melbourne and Victorian Shield representative Peter Cox as the Inaugural First XI Captain.\nThe club originally used the St. Mary's Football Club rooms as its headquarters during the season before the move to the current location on Geelong Cricket Ground in January 1996. The City of Greater Geelong and Geelong Football Club played a major role in developing the club to what it is today after the move off Kardinia Park, with the building of the Ford Stand with seats facing the Geelong Cricket Ground. The two clubs still have a strong working relationship from which both parties benefit. Throughout this time, St. Mary's Football Club (West Kardinia Oval) has continued to be the venue for the club's third and fourth XI matches.\nAs the Pathway to the Baggy Green eight players have been chosen to represent Victoria since the club's inception. Jason Bakker, Clinton Peake, Kevin Neville, Brad Stacey, Daniel Lowery, Ben Oliver, Grant Lindsay, Aaron Finch &amp; Jake K Reed have all played at the highest level, while many others have achieved state and national representation in junior and invitational XI's. \nAaron Finch, of course winning a national Baggy Yellow with his selection in 2010/11 in the Australian T20 team and Australian One Day Side.

The recently completed season also saw the Club have all its four teams participating in finals for the second consecutive season.\nThe Second XI won a sixth premiership in 2011/12 bringing the club tally to 11 two-day premierships, three 3rd XI and two 4th XI.\nThe Geelong Cricket Club's momentum has been building and all that is missing is the much coveted First XI flag to adorn the Bruce Moore Room.\n The club is yet to win a premiership; their best effort was runner-up to Ringwood Cricket Club in 2007–08."

It would also be the last season whereby the British championship was decided by a play-off system until Super League III in 1998. Dewsbury were crowned champions after defeating Leeds in the Final. The 1972–73 season was also punctuated by the 1972 Rugby League World Cup which was played in France in October and November. At the end of this season the league re-formed into two divisions. The top 16 in the championship would form Division 1 and the bottom 14 Division 2.\nRule changes.\nNumber of tackles:\nTimekeeping:\nSeason summary.\nSalford's David Watkins set the record for most goals (including drop goals) in a season with 221. Also, on 19 August 1972, Watkins started his record scoring streak which lasted until 25 April 1974. He totalled 929 points from 41 tries and 403 goals in 92 consecutive matches for one club.\n1972-73 also saw the Wigan club celebrate its centenary, having been formed as Wigan F.C. on 21 November 1872. During the season they played a special Centenary Celebration match against an \"Australians\" side.\nHunslet disbanded at the end of the season, reforming as New Hunslet for the 1973–74 season.\nChampionship.\nFinal.\nThe 1973 Final was to be the last time a play-off system would be used to determine the British champions until 1998's Super League season. The match was played on 19 May 1973 at Bradford's Odsal Stadium between the previous season's champions, Leeds and first-time finalists, Dewsbury. Dewsbury had suffered a county cup record defeat 36–9 at the hands of Leeds in the Yorkshire County Cup Final earlier in the season. Also Leeds had finished 3rd on the ladder and Dewsbury 8th. However, Dewsbury opened up a 12–4 lead by the interval with tries by the hooker Mike Stephenson and Allan Agar and two goals and a drop-goal from the boot of centre Nigel Stephenson. Leeds captain Alan Hardisty was sent off for the first time in his career for a high tackle on John Bates.\nA second try from Mike Stephenson on 44 minutes extended Dewsbury's lead and though Leeds hit back with tries by Graham Eccles, Phil Cookson and Les Dyl, it was not to be with Nigel Stephenson converting his own try to complete a resounding 22-13 success. Leading journalist Jack Winstanley wrote at the time: \"Dewsbury's win sprung from a superb team effort that paid ample tribute to the coaching and inspiration of (coach) Tommy Smales. They bewildered a jaded Leeds outfit with a series of scissors moves and dummy passes that might have looked grossly over-elaborate had they not worked to such perfection.\" The Harry Sunderland Trophy for man-of-the-match went to Mike Stephenson. Greg Ashcroft, Jeff Grayshon and Alan Bates also played in the champion Dewsbury side.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe 1973 Challenge Cup Final was won by Featherstone Rovers who beat Bradford Northern 33–14 at Wembley Saturday 12 May 1973 before a crowd of 72,395. Featherstone Rovers' Great Britain scrum half-back, Steve Nash put in a man-of-the-match performance to win the Lance Todd Trophy. Cyril Kellett scored 8-conversions for Featherstone Rovers, the most in a Challenge Cup Final (equalled by Iestyn Harris in 1999).\nPlayers No.6 Trophy.\nThis was the second season of the League Cup, which was known as the Players No.6 Trophy for sponsorship reasons. Leeds won the trophy by beating Salford 12-7 in the final. The match was played at Fartown, Huddersfield. The attendance was 10,102 and receipts were £4563.\nCounty cups.\nSalford beat Swinton 25–11 to win the Lancashire Cup, and Leeds beat Dewsbury 36–9 to win the Yorkshire Cup."

        "title": "Super Bowl curse",
        "text": "The Super Bowl curse is a phrase that refers to phenomena that may occur in the National Football League (NFL) where the team whose stadium will host the upcoming Super Bowl either misses the playoffs or suffers early postseason elimination.\nNo Super Bowl host team had managed to reach the title game until the 2020 season, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played in Super Bowl LV and won at their home stadium. The next year, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in a home game during Super Bowl LVI.\nSuper Bowl champions rarely win consecutive Super Bowls, compared to other professional sports leagues such as Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League.\nThe team that loses the Super Bowl often has a less successful following season and may miss the playoffs.\nThe term was first used around 1992, when \"The Washington Post\" used the term in print. Former NFL General Manager Charley Casserly attributed the curse to such factors as \"a shorter offseason (five weeks shorter than the 18 teams that failed to make the playoffs), contract problems, [and] more demand for your players' time\". Casserly also noted that \"once the season starts, you become the biggest game on everybody's schedule,\" suggesting that pressure from fans and spectators may also affect a team's performance.\nThe home-field advantage curse.\nThe home-field curse is said to affect a team if the Super Bowl is played at it home stadium. As of 2024, only two teams have played the Super Bowl in their stadiums, the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LV and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams against the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl LVI at their new home, SoFi Stadium; both host teams won. The Buccaneers are the only team to achieve the feat as the designated home team. Super Bowl LVI also marked the first time Los Angeles had hosted since 1993, when the Super Bowl was played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. SoFi Stadium had just opened in 2020. Super Bowl LVI was the eighth Super Bowl played in Los Angeles. Only Miami, Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins, has hosted more Super Bowls (eleven).\nBesides the 2020 Buccaneers and 2021 Rams, only two NFL teams have reached the Super Bowl hosted in their home region: the 1984 San Francisco 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium, rather than Candlestick Park, and the 1979 Los Angeles Rams, who played Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl, rather than the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Besides Stanford Stadium and the Rose Bowl, the only Super Bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an NFL team at the time was Rice Stadium in Houston for Super Bowl VIII: The Houston Oilers had played there previously but moved to the Astrodome several years earlier. The Miami Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowl II and III. Currently, two stadiums are home to two NFL teams of both conferences: MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII, is the home stadium of two NFL teams—the New York Giants and the New York Jets; SoFi Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl LVI, is the home of the Los Angeles Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams.\nSix teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the Dolphins twice in 1994 and 1998, the 2016 Houston Texans, the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams; and three have qualified to play in the conference championship game: the Vikings in the 2017 NFC Championship Game, the Buccaneers in the 2020 NFC Championship Game, and the Rams in the 2021 NFC Championship Game (the 2021 Rams became the first Super Bowl host team to host a Conference Championship). From 1966 to 2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. Beginning with the 2021 season, the NFL stretched to 17 games being played; it is no longer possible to have a split season unless there is a tie game. The Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, regardless of the teams that qualify.\nThis list of examples is not exhaustive; until 2020, no team had ever qualified and played in the Super Bowl while its home stadium was hosting it, home or away. Furthermore, a Super Bowl host stadium's team has never been the #1 seed nor had the best overall record in the league, as the 2020 Buccaneers were the fifth seed in the NFC.\nThe Non-Repeat Curse.\nSince 1993, few winning teams have followed up their Super Bowl appearances with a second Super Bowl appearance or even advanced to a conference title game in the subsequent season (the 1994 Dallas Cowboys qualified for their conference title but did not qualify for the Super Bowl). Only seven teams have won back-to-back Super Bowl championships, and only one of these seven have made more than two consecutive winning appearances in the Super Bowl. The only franchise to reach more than three straight title games was the Buffalo Bills who lost four Super Bowls from 1990 to 1993. The hard salary cap, draft, free agency, schedule, generally large team roster, and generally high injury rate of the sport make it more difficult to win repeat league championships in the NFL compared to other major North American professional sports leagues (Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League) where dynasties have been prevalent.\nBetween the 2004 and 2022 season, no incumbent holder had managed to successfully defend their title until the 2023 Kansas City Chiefs with wins in Super Bowl LVII and LVIII. Between 2006 and 2013, every defending Super Bowl champion would conclude the following season either losing their opening playoff game or failing to qualify for the playoffs.\nThis list of examples includes every team that has ever had back-to-back appearances at the Super Bowl.\nThe \"Super Bowl Runner-Up Jinx\".\nAlthough many teams experience this phenomenon, it is certainly not the rule. There are many speculations made about potential causal factors for this trend, including the team having a shorter offseason due to their extended postseason play, difficulty settling contracts, more pressure on the players, and an increase in visibility, which could contribute to nervous playing. Only the 1971 Dallas Cowboys, 1972 Miami Dolphins, and 2018 New England Patriots have followed up a Super Bowl defeat with a Super Bowl win the following season.\nOne feature of the Super Bowl Runner-Up Jinx is that the team that loses the Super Bowl will not advance as far as the conference championship game the following season — something only three of the last 27 such teams have done (the Patriots twice). Not only that, but 12 of these 27 Super Bowl runners-up did not even make the playoffs the year after, including four that finished last in their division.\nThis list of examples is not exhaustive."

        "text": "Martin James Riley (born May 8, 1955) is a former Canadian basketball player and Olympian. Riley has been described as “one of the finest basketball players to emerge out of the province of Manitoba”.\nRiley played for the Canadian men's national basketball team from 1973 to 1980. Riley made the national team when he was 17 years old, being the first player to make the national team immediately out of high school and being one of the only 17-year-olds in history to make the Canadian national basketball team. Riley was later named the captain of the 1980 Olympic team.\nRiley also had a successful career at the University of Manitoba. He was the CIAU Player of the Year in the 1975–76 season, a three-time First-team All-Canadian (1976-1978), Manitoba's athlete of the year (1976) a CIAU national tournament champion (1976), CIAU tournament MVP (1976) and Great Plains Athletic Conference player of the year (1978), among other accomplishments.\nInternational career.\nRiley represented Canada on their national men's basketball team from 1973 to 1980. Riley made the Canadian national team immediately out of high school as a 17-year-old. He was the first player to earn a spot on the Canadian men's national basketball team immediately out of high school and one of the few 17-year-olds to ever make the Canadian men's national basketball team.\nRiley represented Canada in the 1976 Olympics where Canada finished fourth overall. This was one of only three times in history in which Canada has competed for an Olympic medal in men's basketball. Riley was Canada's fifth overall scorer in these Olympic games.\nCanada qualified for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, with Riley being selected as captain of the team. However, Riley and his teammates unfortunately did not compete in these games seeing that Canada boycotted these Olympics as a result of the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. This 1980 Canadian Olympic team was positioned to be a medal-contender given that Canada competed for the bronze medal in the Olympic games preceding and following these 1980 Olympics (1976, 1984), with this time of Canadian basketball being described as \"arguably the Canadian national team's greatest era\" and \"Canada's golden age of basketball\".\nRiley was also offered a place on the 1984 Olympic team; however, seeing that taking the offer would have resulted in him losing his head coaching position at the University of Manitoba, Riley declined.\nRiley represented Canada in many international tournaments, including the 1974 and 1978 FIBA World Championships, 1975 and 1979 Pan American Games and 1977 and 1979 World University Games. Riley performed well in these tournaments; for example, Riley was Canada's second-leading scorer in the 1978 FIBA World Championship, where Canada finished 6th overall.\nUniversity.\nBefore attending university, Riley was the point guard and captain of the Sisler High School basketball team in Winnipeg during the 1972–73 season. He and his teammates achieved a perfect 35–0 record and won the province's 4A title that year. This team was the only undefeated varsity boys basketball teams in Manitoba for several decades. This year, Riley also was awarded the Carl Ridd award for excellence in academics and basketball.\nRiley played for the University of Manitoba Bisons from 1973 to 1978. He was the CIAU Player of the Year in the 1975–76 season, a First-team All-Canadian in the 1975–76, 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons, and Manitoba's athlete of the year in the 1975–76 season.\nHe and his teammates won the CIAU national championship in 1976, defeating St. Mary's 82–69 in the national final game. Riley was named the CIAU tournament MVP this year. This was the Bison's first and only national title in program history. This was a satisfying win for the Bisons after losing in the CIAU national finals game by one point the prior season. Overall, the Bisons played in the CIAU national tournament four of Riley's five seasons at the university.\nAdditionally, Riley was a CIAU national tournament all-star in the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons, the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) player of the year in the 1977–78 season and a GPAC first-team all-star in the 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons.\nProfessional / Semi-Pro.\nAfter graduating from the University of Manitoba in 1978, Riley played in Canada's Senior Men's Basketball league with the team Nicolett Inn, where he and his teammates won the national senior title in 1979 and 1980. Riley completed his playing career in the 1980–81 season after playing professionally in Argentina for the team River Plate.\nCoaching career.\nRiley was the head coach of the men's basketball team at the University of Manitoba from 1981 to 1984. Riley has also been head coach at the high school level, including at Churchill High School, Dakota Collegiate and Miles Mac Collegiate. At Miles Mac, Riley led the program to two provincial championships. Riley also started the Winnipeg Wolves basketball club in 2006, a basketball program for high school athletes, and has led the Wolves' girls' program.\nPost-career Awards.\nRiley has been inducted into the Canada Basketball Hall of Fame (1995); the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (1991); the Canada West Hall of Fame in their first induction class (2020–21); the Manitoba Basketball Hall of Fame (1996); and the Manitoba High Schools Athletic Association Hall of Fame (2001).\nFurther, the 1976 Canadian men's national team was inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame (2007); the 1976 University of Manitoba men's basketball team was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame (2011); the 1979 and 1980 Nicolett teams from the Canadian senior men's league were inducted into the Manitoba Basketball Hall of Fame (2003); and the 1973 Sisler boys basketball team was inducted into the Manitoba High Schools Athletic Association Hall of Fame (2011), with Riley being a member of each of these teams.\nPersonal life.\nRiley was born May 8, 1955, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was raised in Winnipeg as one of five children raised by his single mother. Riley eventually became a high school teacher, teaching psychology, law and geography at the high school level."

        "title": "1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season",
        "text": "The 1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the first ever season of semi-professional rugby football, which formed the foundation of the modern-day sport of rugby league. Twenty-two Northern English teams from both sides of the Pennines broke away from the Rugby Football Union to create and compete in their own competition.\nThe inaugural Championship ran from September 1895 until April 1896. The Northern Union's first season would prove so popular that the following season saw the addition of several more clubs, and the tournament was split into two separate county competitions.\nBackground.\nThe Rugby Football Union (RFU) had been organising the British rugby football season for much of the late 19th century, maintaining rules of strict amateurism. However clubs from the largely working-class areas of Northern England believed that their players should be compensated for time taken off work as a result of playing rugby. It was put forth in an RFU meeting that broken time payments should be allowed, but the motion was voted down and all clubs were required to prove their amateurism or face expulsion from the Union.\nOn Thursday, 29 August 1895 delegates from twelve Yorkshire and nine Lancashire clubs met at The George Hotel in Huddersfield to discuss their dispute with the RFU over compensating players. They voted unanimously to resign from the RFU and set up the Northern Rugby Football Union (to later be renamed the Rugby Football League) and run a competition of their own in which broken time payments were allowed. Mr H. H. Waller, chairman of the Brighouse club, was elected the first ever chairman of the Northern Rugby Football Union. Of the clubs at that meeting, only Dewsbury backed out for the time being, but two Cheshire clubs, Stockport and Runcorn had joined up by the time the new 'Northern Union' played its first games on 7 September.\nRule changes.\nEach team was to play all other teams twice – once at home and once away. This meant a longer than normal football season so it started a fortnight earlier than usual. In addition to the overall Northern Union championship, these games' results also counted towards final placings in the separate county competitions. The team with the highest standing on the table at the end of the season would be crowned champions of the tournament.\nThe points system for the Northern Union's rugby was as follows:\nOperational rules.\nBroken time payments:\nSeason summary.\nThe new Northern Union competition kicked off on Saturday, 7 September 1895 and, before it had got properly started (before the second weekend's fixtures), there was a move to change the rules of the game to further the interest of spectators and to make rugby that was distinctively different from that authorised by the RFU. In an experimental game at Valley Parade on 1 October between Manningham and Halifax, thirteen players were on each side, line-outs were abolished and, for part of the game, a round ball was used. A fair crowd was attracted and virtually all the officials of the Northern Union looked on. Play was started with the round ball, but midway through the first half it burst. A conventional oval ball replaced it until another round ball could be found in the second half. Little attempt was made to dribble and kick the round ball and it was thus deemed not to be a success. The game ended 3–3, but the long-term ramifications for the Northern Union were to be great indeed.\nThe championship hung in the balance until the final game of the tournament. Manningham needed travel to Hunslet and win in order to beat Halifax by a single point and claim the first Northern Union title. The Manningham team left Midland Station at 2.10, but the committee elected to travel in two stagecoaches. A large following travelled with the team and the road adjacent to the ground was crowded with various vehicles flying banners, flags and even Chinese umbrellas in Manningham's claret and amber colours.\nThe match was played at a furious pace. A crowd of around 15,000 saw the game swing from end to end. The referee at one point had to halt the match in order to caution the players of both sides as the game was getting extremely rough. The match remained scoreless until the second half when Manningham's Jack Brown attempted a drop kick. The ball struck the post, but flew over the bar to wild cheers. Manningham won 4–0 and thereby became the first ever champions of the Northern Union.\nThe Northern Union held an additional contest, for determining county champions, and it was won by Lancashire with Yorkshire second and Cheshire third.\nThe season ended on 29 April, which made it three weeks longer than the footballers at the time were used to. Some clubs had also found the regular trans-Pennine journeys more difficult than they'd expected. Therefore, before the season was over the Union had decided to discontinue the championship for the foreseeable future, and instead run enlarged county senior competitions.\nThe leading try scorer for the season was Jack Hurst from Oldham who crossed the line 28 times. The leading goalkicker for the season was George Lorimer of the Champions, Manningham, who was successful 35 times. The leading point scorer was shared between Cooper of Bradford and George Lorimer of Manningham with a total of 106 points each."

        "text": "The 1931 National Challenge Cup was the annual open cup held by the United States Football Association now known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.\nHistory.\nBy the spring of 1931, the twin ravages of the Great Depression and the \"Soccer Wars\" had taken their toll on the American Soccer League. As a result, Sam Mark moved his Fall River F.C. to New York, hoping that a new market there would be more lucrative. Once there he merged the club with New York Soccer Club and renamed them the New York Yankees. Before the merger was finalised, however, Fall River F.C. had entered the National Challenge Cup and Mark was unable to re-register them as the Yankees. As a result, the Spring 1931 season saw them continue to play in the Challenge Cup as the \"Fall River F.C.\" while at the same time playing as the \"New York Yankees\" in the ASL. While the \"Yankees\" only managed to finish third in the ASL, the \"Marksmen\" won the cup. Largely on the goalscoring strength of Billy Gonsalves, with 9, and Bert Patenaude, with 13, they reached the final where they eventually beat Chicago Bricklayers in a final played as a three-game series. The last of these three games is officially regarded as the last game the 'Marksmen' ever played. The first leg of the final was played on April 5 at the Polo Grounds, where the 'Marksmen' won 6–2, and seemingly established a clear lead. Patenaude scored five goals in that game while Bill McPherson added the other. A week later at Mills Stadium in Chicago, the Bricklayers kept the series alive by earning a 1–1 draw. This time Gonsalves got on the score sheet. Sparta Stadium in Chicago attracted 4,500 for the deciding game on April 19. The 'Marksmen' could only field 10 players after their captain, Alex McNab, broke his arm in a midweek friendly and the club had neglected to bring along any reserves. Despite this they still managed to win 2–0 with goals from Patenaude and Gordon Burness.\nThe 'Marksmen' were not the only club to relocate, merge or disappear. This has made it difficult to follow the teams as they progressed through this year's competition. To muddy the waters more, the Providence F.C. had been bought by a group of Fall River businessmen and moved to that city to replace the 'Marksmen'. The 'Gold Bugs' were then renamed Fall River F.C. Furthermore, after the 'Gold Bugs' had moved to Fall River to become Fall River F.C., it merged with the New Bedford Whalers. As these teams had all played initial Challenge Cup games, the results become difficult to follow.\nWestern Division.\nRound Robin groups for Quarterfinal qualifying."

It is made from mayonnaise with a smaller amount of tomato-based sauce such as ketchup, as well as seasonings including pimento, oregano, and cumin.\nOrigin.\nAccording to legend, the sauce was invented by the physician Luis Federico Leloir in the mid-1920s at the golf club of the seaside resort Mar del Plata. Tired of eating shrimp and prawn with mayonnaise, he asked the waiter to bring various ingredients (vinegar, lemon, mustard, ketchup, and others) and experimented with different mixtures. The favourite was ketchup and mayonnaise. Leloir's companions named the result \"salsa golf\", and its fame grew. Soon it spread to neighboring Uruguay while also being common in Chile.\nRecipes.\nThere are several recipes, but the sauce is always mostly mayonnaise with a tomato-based sauce like ketchup. Seasoning is added to give the sauce an Argentine flavor, such as pimento, oregano, and cumin. The mixture can also include Worcestershire sauce and mustard.\n\"\" is used to dress salad, meat, and other food, and it is the main ingredient in a typical Argentine dish called \"palmitos en salsa golf\".\nIn neighboring Paraguay, ' is also very popular and is sometimes eaten as a delicacy with quail eggs.

        "text": "Chris Butler (born October 27, 1986) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Buffalo Sabres, Calgary Flames and hometown club, St. Louis Blues. Butler was a fourth round selection of the Sabres, chosen 96th overall at the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. He then played three seasons at the University of Denver before turning professional in 2008.\nEarly life.\nButler grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri, playing both hockey and baseball. He attended Chaminade College Preparatory School (Missouri) for high school. His father Doug was also a professional hockey player, drafted by the NHL's Boston Bruins and the Calgary Cowboys of the World Hockey Association in 1977, and played parts of three seasons in the American Hockey League (AHL). Doug coached his son as the younger Butler grew up. Chris's mother, Martha, was also an athlete who played field hockey while she attended college in St. Louis.\nPlaying career.\nJunior and college.\nButler played high school hockey in St. Louis for Chaminade College Prep., one season in Junior B followed by two seasons with the Sioux City Musketeers of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He led the Musketeers with a +36 plus-minus rating in 2004–05, played in the league's All-Star Game and was named to the first All-Star team following the season. He was then selected by the Buffalo Sabres, 96th overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft but first committed to attend and play hockey at the University of Denver.\nIn his first season with the Denver Pioneers, Butler was selected to join the United States junior team at the 2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He played four games for the fourth place Americans. Butler spent three seasons with the Pioneers, scoring 20 goals and 66 points in that time. He was the team's assistant captain in 2007–08 and was considered the team's top defenseman while being named an All-American. Butler left the Pioneers following his junior season, signing an entry-level contract with the Sabres.\nProfessional.\nButler began the 2008–09 season with the Sabres' AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He appeared in 27 games for the Pirates and scored 12 points when he was recalled to Buffalo on December 18, 2008. He made his NHL debut the following night against the Los Angeles Kings, a 5–0 victory in which he scored his first NHL point with an assist on a goal by Adam Mair. He scored his first goal on March 20, 2009, against Martin Biron of the Philadelphia Flyers. Butler appeared in 47 games for the Sabres in his rookie season, scoring two goals and four assists.\nAn ankle injury forced Butler out of the Sabres' lineup for 12 games in 2009–10, but he posted improved offensive numbers, scoring 21 points in 59 games. Still, he found himself marginalized by the Sabres late in the season, and stated himself that he lacked consistency in his play in 2010–11. He appeared in 49 games for the Sabres, and while his offensive production dropped to nine points, he improved his plus-minus to +8 after finishing −15 the year previous. Following the season, however, Butler was packaged in a deal that saw him dealt to the Calgary Flames along with Paul Byron on June 25, 2011, in exchange for Robyn Regehr, Ales Kotalik and a second round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. The Flames quickly signed him to a two-year, US$2.5 million contract. During his tenure with the Flames, Butler tied a dubious plus-minus record, finishing -7 during a January 5, 2012 game against the Boston Bruins.\nOn July 16, 2014, Butler signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the hometown club, the St. Louis Blues. On July 1, 2015, Butler re-signed with the Blues on a one-year, one-way contract worth $675,000. Butler familiarly agree to remain with the Blues to following season, agreeing in free agency to return for a third season on July 2, 2016.\nIn his fifth season within the Blues organization in the 2018–19 season, Butler continued as a veteran presence in the AHL while splitting the year between the San Antonio Rampage and the Blues. He made 13 regular season appearances with St. Louis, contributing with 1 goal and 2 points. He was a part of the extended playoff squad for the Blues, and as a part of the Blues first Stanley Cup championship he skated with cup following the Stanley Cup Finals Game 7 victory over the Boston Bruins.\nOn July 3, 2019, Butler reportedly retired from hockey after 11 professional seasons.\nCoaching career.\nBulter remained within hockey in accepting an amateur scouting role with the Arizona Coyotes organization for the season. After a lone season with the Coyotes, on August 8, 2022, Butler moved to the Pittsburgh Penguins organization after he was announced as a player development coach, to help develop defensive prospects."

        "title": "2009 Baseball World Cup",
        "text": "The 2009 Baseball World Cup (BWC) was the 38th international men's amateur baseball tournament. The tournament was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation, which titled it the Amateur World Series from the 1938 tournament through the 1986 AWS. The 2009 tournament was held, for the first time, across a continent — with games played in 27 cities across eight European countries, from September 9 to 27. The final was a repeat of the previous BWC final, with the United States again defeating Cuba, winning its fourth title. Canada won the bronze medal, the nation's first medal in the tournament, after defeating Puerto Rico 6–2.\nThere were 22 participating countries (which stands as the most ever in tournament history), with 20 teams split into five groups for the first round, after which \"official\" host Italy and 2007 European Champion Netherlands joined the advancing 14 teams in the second round.\nThe next competition would be the last amateur championship held as the BWC tournament, which was replaced in 2015 by the quadrennial WBSC Premier12.\nFormat.\nPrevious editions of the World Cup were held with no more than 18 teams. These teams were initially broken up into two pools, with the top teams from each pool qualifying for the final knockout stage. With 22 teams competing in the 2009 tournament, the format has been expanded into three phases. Teams that play from the first round and finish among the top eight teams of the tournament will now have played as many as 15 games, making it one of the longest campaigns for any international baseball tournament.\nAll of the teams, with the exception of Italy and Netherlands, will compete in the first round (as hosts for the second-round games, Italy and Netherlands receive a bye through the first round). The teams will be broken into five pools of four teams each. Each pool will be held in a different country, with the hosts Czech Republic, Spain, Sweden, Croatia and Germany assigned to the corresponding pools. (Previously, Russia had been set as the host nation for Pool D, however they were replaced by Croatia in an announcement from the IBAF.) Unlike the 2009 World Baseball Classic, the pools will be conducted in single round-robin format. The top two teams from each pool will automatically qualify for the second round, while four of the five third-place finishers will also qualify as wild cards. In some respects, the first round is like a final qualifying tournament, similar to the format used for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nThe second round operates similarly to the first, but on an expanded scale. The field of teams is split into two pools, one hosted in Italy, the other in the Netherlands. The fourteen qualifiers from the first round are assigned to the pools, and commence a single round-robin competition. The top four teams from each pool then qualify for the third and final round.\nThe third round is broken into two parts: a partial round-robin and then four classification games, including the final. Each team will play four games during the round-robin phase, against the teams they have not yet faced (in Round 2) who also qualified – i.e. the teams from the Italian pool will face the teams from the Netherlands pool, but not each other. The teams are then ranked on their results in this phase and in games of the 2nd round between qualified teams, but in two groups based on the pool they qualified from. Each team then plays a classification game against their counterpart from the opposite group to determine their final placings in the tournament – i.e. the fourth place Italian qualifier faces the fourth place Netherlands qualifier to determine seventh and eighth positions, the third place qualifiers compete for fifth and sixth positions, and so on. The winner of the final classification game will be declared the winner of the World Cup for 2009.\nTiebreaking procedures.\nThe IBAF employs a standard tiebreaking system across all tournaments it sanctions, though it will use a modified version for this World Cup. Ordinarily there are five criteria available to be used when two or more teams finish the tournament (or a section thereof) with the same winning percentage; if the first method does not split the teams involved, the next one is used, continuing down the list of methods until a distinction is achieved. The criteria used to determine the higher placed finishing team, in order, are:\nFor this World Cup though, a simplified method of tiebreaking will be used:\nIn the case of determining the four wild card teams that will progress from the first to the second round, the first measure will automatically be skipped, as it will be impossible for the teams to have played against each other.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams qualified for the tournament, either through finishing high enough in the 2007 World Cup, placing high enough in regional tournaments that doubled as qualifying tournaments for the event, or by automatic qualification by hosting some part of the tournament.\nRound 3.\nSemi finals.\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nAwards.\nThe IBAF announced the following awards at the completion of the tournament."

        "title": "Small ball (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, small ball is a style of play that sacrifices height, physical strength and low post offense/defense in favor of a lineup of smaller players for speed, agility and increased scoring (often from the three-point line). It is closely tied to the concepts of pace and space, which pushes the speed of the offense and spreads out the defense with extra shooters on the court. Many small ball lineups feature a non-traditional center who offers skills that are not normally found from players at that position.\nTeams often move a physically dominant player who would typically play the small forward position into the power forward position. Examples of players who have been used in this role include Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James. That individual would play alongside either a traditional power forward (shifted into the center position), or alongside a center.\nThe advantage of using small ball is that the power forward position is occupied by a faster, more agile player who can outrun and outmaneuver the opposing power forward. In many cases the player may have a better three-point shooting percentage than a traditional power forward, which (as well as increasing points from three-point plays) can help spread the opposition defense. The opposing defender will come out to mark the player on the perimeter of the three point line, allowing space for teammates to run in and score around the basket. A player occupying this position, with a high three-point shot success percentage, is coined a \"stretch four\". Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra employed this style of play starting in 2011–12, labeling it as \"pace and space\". Early in the playoffs, small forward LeBron James filled in at power forward after the Heat lost starter Chris Bosh to injury. James remained at that position for the remainder of the playoffs, as Bosh was moved to center when he returned.\nWhile the style of play does have advantages, there are several disadvantages. The addition of speed and agility comes at the cost of strength and height; the lack of traditional \"big men\" can make it more difficult to guard the space under the basket while on defense and can also prevent the team from having a low-post offensive threat when attacking. Rebounding is often sacrificed; for example, in the 2012–13 season, the Miami Heat, playing small ball, had the most wins during the season, but were the worst team in the NBA in rebounding. \nThe biggest exposure of the shortcomings of a small and short team surely was on display in the Western Conference finals of 2018, where Houston Rockets, 1st seed of both the West and best team of the season, led by MVP James Harden with Chris Paul had a 3–2 lead over eventual &amp; reigning champions, Golden State Warriors but were pushed into Game 7. The Rockets led the 1st half by double digits, yet their greatest strength also became their achilles heel where they spectacularly missed a record breaking 27 consecutive 3s, they lost by only 9pts, exposing just how over reliant their small ball system was on making 3s. A more balanced/traditionally sized team would have been better placed for scoring by other means than long ranged shots after such a drought of failed shots.\nThe Golden State Warriors in 2014–15 used small ball to a greater extent in the NBA Finals than any prior champion, swapping out big man Andrew Bogut from the starting lineup for Andre Iguodala, who would eventually be named the Finals MVP. The Warriors' small lineup came to be known as the Death Lineup. The Warriors attained a historic level of success, winning three NBA titles and setting the NBA wins record during the period from 2014 to 2017. The success of the Warriors' small ball lineups has caused some analysts to consider small ball to be the future of basketball, eschewing traditional lineups in favor of a brand of \"positionless\" basketball that allows teams to play small."

He later managed a newsagent's shop and was also a window cleaner. Having been Yorkshire amateur champion on eleven occasions, and the CIU Championship in 1963, 1966 and 1969, Dunning turned professional in 1971 at the age of 45. He played his first World Championship match in 1972, when he lost to John Pulman in the first round, after beating Pat Houlihan and Graham Miles in qualifying. He produced his best performance in 1974, when he reached the quarter-final, subsequently losing his match against Miles 13–15. Dunning's final appearance in the main stages of the event came in 1982.\nIn 1977, he reached the quarter-finals of the inaugural UK Championship, losing 0–5 to Alex Higgins.\nDunning reached the final of the International Masters in March 1984. The tournament, played on a three-man-group round-robin basis, saw Dunning start as a 7–1 outsider to qualify from his first group. He beat Tony Knowles 2–1 in the opening game, he became favourite, before comfortably winning his next match against Les Dodd.

The firing came after a controversial game the previous night, which allowed Louisiana–Lafayette a game-winning shot with six players on the court during overtime. The error was discovered immediately after the game. Coach McDonald and athletic director Ross Bjork contested the results at the scorer's table. However, officials declined to review the incident due to NCAA rules. He was replaced by assistant coach Ray Harper in interim, who was eventually named head coach moving forward.\nIn September 2013, he was promoted from assistant to head coach of the Austin Toros. On July 27, 2015, he signed a contract extension with the now Austin Spurs.\nOn April 12, 2018, McDonald was hired as an assistant coach for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball team, working under head coach Frank Haith."

        "text": "The St. John's Red Storm men's basketball team represents St. John's University located in Queens, New York. The team participates in the Big East Conference, where it is a founding member of the league. As of the end of the 2022–23 season, St. John's ranked ninth with 1,922 total wins among NCAA Division I teams. St. John's has appeared in 30 NCAA tournaments, most recently appearing in 2019. The Red Storm's best finish in the NCAA tournament came in 1952 when they were NCAA runner-ups and made the Final Four. St. John's also made a Final Four appearance in 1985. St. John's is coached by Rick Pitino.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1907–1927).\nThe St. John's men's basketball team played its first game on December 6, 1907, losing to New York University and registering its first win in program history against Adelphi University on January 3, 1908. Just three years later, the 1910–11 team were undefeated in a 14–0 season coached by former track and field Olympian Claude Allen, for which the team was later honored by the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll as national champions.\nBuck Freeman era (1927–1936).\nThe Wonder Five.\nTwenty years later, former St. John's player Buck Freeman was hired as coach. In his first four years, from 1927 to 1931, the team had a 85–8 record. The 1929–30 and 1930–31 teams were known as the \"Wonder Five\", made up of Matty Begovich, Mac Kinsbrunner, Max Posnack, Allie Schuckman, and Jack \"Rip\" Gerson, who together helped revolutionize the game of basketball and made St. John's the marquee team in New York City. On January 19, 1931, the Wonder Five team was a part of the first college basketball triple-header at Madison Square Garden in a charity game which saw St. John's beat CCNY by a score 17–9. Freeman finished his coaching career with a record of 177–31, an .850 winning percentage.\nFirst Joe Lapchick era (1936–1947).\nJoe Lapchick, a former player of the Original Celtics, took over as head coach at St. John's in 1936 and continued the success the school had become used to under Buck Freeman. Lapchick coached from 1936 to 1947 and again from 1956 to 1965. His Redmen teams won four NIT championships (1943, 1944, 1959, 1965). Lapchick preferred to take his teams to the more prestigious NIT instead of the NCAA tournament, making the NIT semifinals 8 out of a total 12 times, and only one NCAA tournament appearance in his 20 years of coaching the Redmen. Under Lapchick's coaching his teams also won six Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles.\nBack-to-back NIT Champions.\nOn its way to its first of back-to-back NIT titles, St. John's had a record of 21–3 with only two losses occurring during the regular season. One was a 40–46 home loss to rival Niagara and another was a 38–42 loss at Madison Square Garden to Manhattan. The 1942–43 St. John's team were led by senior caption Andrew \"Fuzzy\" Levane and sophomore All-American center Harry Boykoff. The Redmen's trademark defense and inside scoring presence of Boykoff led them past Rice, Fordham, and Toledo to claim the first of six NIT titles. The season did not end after the NIT; three days later St. John's participated in the first Red Cross charity benefit game against NCAA champion Wyoming to determine a national champion. Wyoming won, 52–47.\nSt. John's became the first team to repeat as champions in the seven-year history of the NIT even though World War II and the players' commitment to serve in the armed forces made it a very difficult season. Harry Boykoff missed the 1943–44 and 1944–45 seasons due to being drafted for the war effort, along with the team's star point guard Dick McGuire for half the 1943–44 season and the entire following two years. Despite the losses of their star players, the St. John's team managed to finish the season with an 18–5 record and a second NIT crown by defeating Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats and Ray Meyer's DePaul Blue Demons. The Redmen were led by playmaking junior guards Hy Gotkin and Bill Kotsores, the latter of whom was selected as the 1944 NIT Most Valuable Player. For the second year in a row the Redmen participated in the Red Cross benefit game where they faced the NCAA champion Utah, and lost 36–44. The 1951 1952 team lost to Kentucky 81–40 in December 1951. In the NCAA tournament, St John's beat Kentucky, 64–57. They later finished second in the tournament to Kansas.\nSt. John's success continued the following year where they produced another 21–3 record, but their chance at a rematch with George Mikan's DePaul squad and a third consecutive NIT title was shattered with an upset loss to Bowling Green in the semifinals. They beat Rhode Island State for a third-place finish. Lapchick's Redmen made the NIT both of the next two years and added two more Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles before heleft to take the head coaching job of the New York Knickerbockers in just the second year of their existence in the new Basketball Association of America, becoming the highest paid coach of the league at the time.\nFrank McGuire era (1947–1952).\nLapchick was succeeded by Frank McGuire, a former player under Buck Freeman, who made the postseason four out of five years as the coach and had an overall record of 102–36, culminating in a second-place finish in the 1952 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Under McGuire, the Redmen reached an overall number one ranking in The Associated Press poll twice, won three Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles, competed in four NITs and made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament where they made it to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual national champion Kentucky. They defeated North Carolina State for a regional third-place finish that year.\nAt the end of the season, McGuire left St. John's to become the basketball coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On paper, this was a significant step down from St. John's, as UNC was not reckoned as a national power at the time. However, school officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of rival North Carolina State under Everett Case. McGuire's assistant coach, Al \"Dusty\" DeStefano, took over the head coaching duties of St. John's from 1952 to 1956. DeStefano's teams only made one postseason appearance and it was a 58–46 loss to the Seton Hall Pirates in the NIT Finals who were led by All-American center Walter Dukes. The following year, the Redmen had their first losing season in over 30 years.\nSecond Joe Lapchick era (1956–1965).\nOne month after leaving his position with the New York Knicks, Lapchick resumed his head coaching duties where he started and put St. John's back on its winning path. Picking up where he left off, he added two more NIT championships, made the postseason 6 out of 9 times, and finished with an overall college coaching record of 334–130. In 20 years of coaching in the college ranks, Lapchick only had one losing season.\n1959 &amp; 1965 NIT Champions.\nSt. John's finished the 1958–59 season with an overall 20–6 record and captured its first ECAC Holiday Festival title with a 90–79 victory over St. Joseph's in the final and the school's third NIT championship by defeating top-seeded Bradley 76–70 in double overtime. The starting five for the Redmen consisted of four seniors and sophomore sensation Tony Jackson who was named both the Holiday Festival and NIT Most Valuable Player during the 1958–59 season, setting a school record of 27 rebounds in one game. At the end of the season senior captain Alan Seiden was rewarded with second team All-American honors and the Haggerty Award, given to the best collegiate player in the New York metropolitan area. Throughout the next three years, St. John's went 58–18, led by Jackson who received All-American honors all three years at school, 6'11\" center and future NBA champion LeRoy Ellis, and future ABA/NBA coach Kevin Loughery. In the 1961–62 season, St. John's made their fifth NIT finals appearance before falling to Dayton 73–67.\nLapchick went into the 1964–65 season knowing it would be his last year coaching at St. John's because he reached age 65, the mandatory retirement age of the university. His team began the year off by upsetting Cazzie Russell's Michigan Wolverines, the No. 1 team in the nation according to both the Associated Press and United Press International polls, by a score of 75–74 to capture the school's second ECAC Holiday Festival title. St. John's finished the season 21–8 and went on a remarkable run in the 1965 NIT by defeating Boston College, New Mexico, Army, and top-seeded Villanova to win Lapchick his fourth NIT championship. The Redmen were led by the rebounding of sophomore forward Lloyd \"Sonny\" Dove and the scoring of senior Ken McIntyre who totaled 101 points in his last four games, over 1,000 points for his college career, and being named the Most Valuable Player of both the Holiday Festival and the National Invitational Tournament.\nLou Carnesecca era (1965–1992).\nLou Carnesecca was hired as the head basketball coach at St. John's in 1965, after serving as an assistant at St. John's since 1958, and given the difficult task to follow in the footsteps of Lapchick. In the 1985 NCAA tournament, he coached the Redmen to their second Final Four appearance. He was named the National Coach of the Year in 1983 and 1985 and Big East Coach of the Year on three occasions. His record at St. John's was 526–200. Carnesecca led the team to its record fifth NIT title in 1989, to the NCAA's Elite Eight in 1979 and 1991, and to the Sweet Sixteen in 1967, 1969, and 1983.\nCarnesecca temporarily left St. John's to coach in the ABA from 1970 to 1973, when it was coached by former player Frank Mulzoff, who gathered a record of 56–27 and three post-season appearances. Upon Carnesecca's return, he continued to guide the program to 29 consecutive postseason tournament appearances and to playing in a major conference, the Big East.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Red Storm have appeared in the NCAA tournament 30 times. Their combined record is 27–32. Due to impermissible benefits to a player, their 2002 appearance has been vacated by the NCAA making their official record 27–31.\nNIT results.\nThe Red Storm have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 30 times. Their combined record is 45–30. They are six-time NIT Champions (1943, 1944, 1959, 1965, 1989, 2003). Due to impermissible benefits to a player, their 2003 appearance (and title) has been vacated by the NCAA, making their official record 40–30.\nSt. John's rivalries.\nBig East rivalries.\nThe St. John's-Georgetown rivalry was one of the most intense matchups in the Big East during the 1980s, highlighted by the 1985 Big East Championship, 1985 NCAA semifinal game, the \"Sweater Game\" between Hall of Fame coaches Lou Carnesecca and John Thompson, and Hall of Fame players Chris Mullin and Patrick Ewing. St. John's fans also count other East Coast rivals the Villanova Wildcats, Providence Friars, Seton Hall Pirates, and former Big East founders Syracuse Orange and the Boston College Eagles along with the Connecticut Huskies and Pittsburgh Panthers among their most frequently played opponents.\nNew York rivalries.\nSt. John's fifth most frequent played opponent is fellow Vincentian and Western New York college, the Niagara Purple Eagles. The universities have played each other every college basketball season since 1909. St. John's also frequently plays other New York City opponents representing the four other NYC boroughs; the Fordham Rams and Manhattan Jaspers of The Bronx, the St. Francis Terriers and LIU Blackbirds of Brooklyn, the NYU Violets and CCNY Beavers of Manhattan, and the Wagner Seahawks of Staten Island. These teams were all instrumental in creating the postseason National Invitational Tournament hosted annually at Madison Square Garden. From 1933 to 1963 most of these schools came together to play each other in the Metropolitan New York Conference. The Red Storm own an all-time record of 250–86 against these other New York City schools.\nNotable players and coaches.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Members.\nThe following St. John's players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame.\nAwards and honors.\nMetropolitan Basketball Writers Association award winners.\nAll-Metropolitan First Team\nFacilities.\nDeGray Gymnasium (1932–1956).\nDeGray Gymnasium was the original home of the St. John's Redmen when the university was located at 75 Lewis Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, NY.

When the university was transitioning from Brooklyn to Queens, the basketball team split their home games between the old Madison Square Garden and Martin Van Buren High School for five seasons.\nCarnesecca Arena (1961–present).\nIn 1961, home games were moved to the 5,602-seat Alumni Hall on the newly constructed Queens campus opening with a 79–65 win over George Washington University. On November 23, 2004, the building and court were renamed for Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca.\nMadison Square Garden (1931–present).\nOn January 19, 1931, St. John's was a part of the first college basketball triple-header at the third Madison Square Garden on 8th Avenue and 50th Street in a charity game which saw St. John's beat CCNY by a score 17–9. St. John's has played at least one game in the arena every year since then, for a record 89 consecutive seasons, for both regular season home games, preseason and postseason tournaments including the Big East, NIT, and Holiday Festival.\nTaffner Field House.\nThe current training facility of the St. John's basketball team is Taffner Field House, located on the Queens campus adjacent to Carnesecca Arena.

        "title": "2008 end-of-year rugby union internationals",
        "text": "The 2008 end of year rugby tests, also known as the Autumn internationals saw Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, the Pacific Islanders and Canada tour the northern hemisphere. The tour ended with the traditional 'final challenge' Barbarians match, against Australia, which was the first rugby union Test at the new Wembley Stadium. New Zealand and Australia also contested a Bledisloe Cup match outside of either country for the first time; the match was played in Hong Kong with the hope of raising rugby's profile in China.\nThe test matches took on added significance, with seedings for the 2011 Rugby World Cup draw to take place on 1 December at stake. For the first time in the history of the Rugby World Cup, the International Rugby Board used the IRB World Rankings to seed teams in the World Cup draw. Teams will be assigned to four-strong seeding pots based on their rankings; each team within a pot will be drawn into a different pool for the World Cup finals.\nNew Zealand recorded a second straight grand slam tour.\nWeek 4.\nGoing into Week 4, the main storyline was the battle for fourth place in the IRB World Rankings. New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia were entrenched in the top three. The team that stood in fourth place on 1 December would avoid being drawn into the same pool as one of the Tri Nations powers in 2011. Four teams could have ended the week in fourth place: Argentina, England, France, and Wales.\nThe missed conversion by Ronan O'Gara on Ireland's only try of the match proved decisive for Argentina. With the other results on the day, the Pumas would have dropped to fifth place, behind England, if O'Gara had converted, as it would have given Ireland a win by more than 15 points. As it turned out, Argentina retained fourth by a narrow margin.\nWeek 5.\nThe battle for fourth place in the IRB World Rankings finished this weekend, with Argentina remaining in fourth place without playing as England lost and Wales failed to achieve the 15-point winning margin required. Argentina therefore took top seeding for the following month's 2011 Rugby World Cup draw along with the three Tri-Nations teams.\nThe other major news of the week was New Zealand's win over England, completing a successful Grand Slam tour for the All Blacks. This was the All Blacks' third such successful tour, with the previous ones being in 1978 and 2005.\nEffect on World Cup seeding.\nFollowing the 29 November tests, the 12 teams that qualified automatically for the 2011 Rugby World Cup were seeded thus:\nPot 1\nPot 2\nPot 3"

        "text": "George Ivory (born August 7, 1965) is the head men's basketball coach for Mississippi Valley State University. He was the head men's basketball coach at the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff from 2008 to 2021. Previously, Ivory was an assistant at Mississippi Valley State, his alma mater, from 1998–2002, 2007–2008, and 2021–2022.\nPlaying career.\nIvory grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, where he attended Murrah High School, one of the top basketball schools in the country. He played at Murrah for three years, winning numerous awards prior to graduating in 1983. \nAfter Ivory finished at Murrah High School, he went on to attend college at Mississippi Valley State University. While at MVSU Ivory was selected as Freshman of the Year, First Team All-SWAC, SWAC Tournament MVP, and Player of the Year in the conference. Ivory started all four years at Mississippi Valley State University, where he still ranks tops in scoring, steals, assist, minutes, and games played. \nUpon graduating from Mississippi Valley State University in 1988 with a bachelor's degree, and after trying out professionally with the Chicago Bulls, Harlem Globetrotters, and Illinois Express, Ivory was drafted by the Wyoming Wildcatters of the CBA.\nCoaching career.\nIvory later went back to college at Jackson State University to receive his master's degree in 1996 while working as a graduate assistant with the Lady Tigers for three years before becoming a full-time assistant in 1991–1998 under head coach Andrew Pennington. \nJSU won two tournament championships, a regular-season championship, and made one NCAA appearance. In the fall of 1998, Ivory accepted a similar position with Mississippi Valley State University as men's assistant coach under then-head coach Lafayette Stribling, where they had several outstanding recruiting classes as well as several outstanding teams which competed for SWAC titles for consecutive years. \nIvory subsequently crossed the state line to become an assistant coach at UAPB in the fall of 2002 under then-head coach Van Holt. Holt and staff led the Golden Lions to the finals of the SWAC Tournament in 2005–06. \nIn 2006–07, Ivory crossed another state line as he was hired as an assistant coach at Grambling State University under then-head coach Larry Wright. In 2007–08 Ivory went back to his alma mater Mississippi Valley State University as an assistant coach under then-head coach James Green, where they went on to win the SWAC Tournament Championship and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\nArkansas–Pine Bluff.\nIn the spring of 2008, Ivory was named the head coach of Arkansas-Pine Bluff. Prior to the start of his first season, the Golden Lions were picked 9th in the SWAC's preseason poll, but UAPB went on to finish in 4th place in the SWAC during their 2008–09 campaign. Arkansas-Pine Bluff also completed conference play with a winning record for the first time in school history. \nThe 2009–10 basketball season brought about unprecedented success for the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff men's basketball team. After starting the year 0–11, the Golden Lions finished the season with a remarkable run all the way to the NCAA tournament. The Golden Lions went 18–5 over the course of their last 23 games as they concluded the season with an 18–16 overall record.\nUAPB won the 2010 SWAC Basketball Tournament Championship, marking the schools’ first title in over four decades (1967). Arkansas-Pine Bluff followed their undefeated SWAC tourney run with a victory over the Winthrop Eagles in the NCAA Opening Round game, snapping a 17-year conference losing streak in the NCAA tournament.\nThe Golden Lions eventually faced the NCAA National Champion Duke University basketball team in the first round of the tournament. Arkansas-Pine Bluff was the only Division I institution from the state of Arkansas to qualify for the NCAA tournament. For his teams outstanding accomplishments on the court Ivory was named the 2010 HSRN National Coach of the Year, becoming the first coach from Arkansas-Pine Bluff to be awarded such honors. On April 6, 2021, Ivory resigned from UAPB after 13 seasons at the helm.\nMississippi Valley State.\nOn March 14, 2022, Ivory was named the 12th head coach at his alma mater, Mississippi Valley State, replacing Lindsey Hunter."

Rugby statistician Serge Piquet has produced a currently unofficial, but generally accepted, world ranking, but where rankings are referred to by some boards these will normally be the finishing positions in the previous Women's Rugby World Cup (which only takes place every four years and will only include those countries that qualified for the finals).\nThe IRB's seedings for each World Cup are also influenced by positions in the previous tournament, but not entirely decided by them. The table below shows the final positions for the 2014 tournament and is therefore the closest thing to an \"official\" IRB ranking:\nRugby Europe Ranking.\nRugby Europe, formerly known as FIRA-AER, do produce an annual ranking of European nations, based on previous season's Rugby Europe and Six Nations competitions, for use in RE tournaments (though Six Nations teams are often given a higher seeding in tournaments than their ranking might suggest). As these will be based on more recent performances they can contradict the IRB list and also include countries not featuring in the World Cup-based ranking. On the other hand, they obviously only include European nations. Rankings (based on previous season results) appear to be:\nSevens.\nCurrent playing record (to end of 2011).\nDetailed results from a small number of tournaments, especially in Africa and Asia, have never been published. The following table therefore relates to the published tournament results. Note: Almost all of New Zealand's sevens matches - apart from the 2009 World Cup and qualifier and two Hong Kong Sevens - have been played by \"Aotearoa Maori\" and (before 2000) \"New Zealand Wild Ducks\". While in some cases they were officially sanctioned by the NZRU, neither were full New Zealand teams, and occasionally included players not eligible to play for New Zealand. As a result, they are not included in the table below. \"The playing record of these unofficial New Zealand teams is: Played 59, Won 55, Lost 4, 93.22%.\"\nOfficial rankings.\nIRB World Ranking.\nAs with rankings for 15-a-side rugby, IRB rankings for Sevens are based on the finishing positions in the previous World Cup.

The tournament was held from 30 August to 14 September 2014. Hosted by Spain, it was the last tournament to be held on the then-current four-year cycle. The next FIBA World Cup was held five years later, in 2019, to reset the four-year-cycle on a different year than the FIFA World Cup.\nThe United States won their fifth world championship, after beating silver medal-winning Serbia in the Final. France claimed the third place, while Lithuania finished fourth in the tournament.\nHost selection.\nFIBA opened the bidding process on 10 January 2008 and all the letters of intent were submitted on 30 April 2008.\nNine countries showed interest in hosting the event, as in order, they were Spain, France, Denmark, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Italy, Greece, and China.\nAmong the nine, only three were shortlisted by FIBA: China which would have hosted the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship later that year, Italy which last hosted a FIBA tournament in EuroBasket Women 2007, and FIBA EuroBasket 2007 host Spain.\nOn 23 May 2009, after voting by the FIBA Central Board in Geneva in which the Chinese and Spanish representatives abstained, China was the first to be eliminated in the first round of voting. In the final round, Arvydas Sabonis and Saša Djordjević announced that Spain won the hosting rights with eleven votes as opposed to Italy's eight.\nVenues.\nThe Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid was the main venue, hosting the final and half of the matches in the final round. While no arenas from the 1986 FIBA World Championship were reused, the current Madrid arena was built on the site of the original venue that was destroyed by fire in 2001, which was a venue used in 1986. Amongst venues used in FIBA EuroBasket 2007, the arenas in Granada, Seville and Madrid were reused. One arena, the Gran Canaria Arena, was the only new venue, being built after the tournament was awarded to Spain. The other cities hosted a group.\nOn 17 April 2010, Barcelona was added to the list of cities to hold games, bringing the total venues to six. This was Barcelona's first time being part of a major international event in basketball since the 1997 EuroBasket, in which the Palau Sant Jordi hosted the final stages. Barcelona will host half of the games in the knockout stage, including a semifinal.\nBelow is a list of the confirmed venues which were used to host games during the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Connor Floor was the official supplier of the basketball courts for each of the six sites.\nQualification.\nThere were 24 teams taking part in the 2014 World Cup of Basketball. After the 2012 Olympics, the continental allocation for FIBA Americas was reduced by one when the United States won the Olympic tournament, automatically qualifying them for the 2014 World Cup.\nQualified teams.\nAs of 21 September 2013, twenty teams had already qualified for the final tournament in 2014. To complete the 24-team tournament, FIBA would announce the four wild cards after a meeting in Barcelona on 1–2 February 2014; they could have announced an initial list of teams that would be considered after a Buenos Aires meeting on 23–24 November 2013. But later the FIBA Central Board decided not to trim the list of wild card applicants on their Buenos Aires meeting, making all 15 teams eligible to be selected on the February meeting at Barcelona.\nOn 1 February 2014, FIBA announced that it had allocated the wild cards to , , and .\nSuspension of Senegal.\nOn the FIBA Central Board meeting in Buenos Aires, FIBA suspended the basketball federations of Guatemala, Morocco and Senegal indefinitely \"due to their inability to properly function as the governing body for basketball in their respective countries.\" The Senegalese federation was suspended reportedly due to age fabrication in the 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship for Men and for Women; the Senegalese federation was dissolved as a result. On 2 February, FIBA lifted the suspension on the Senegalese federation after they complied with all of the requirements imposed by the FIBA, clearing the way for the participation of its national team in the tournament.\nRule and format changes.\nThis was the first time the NBA-style 4.90m rectangular free throw lane, the 1.25m restricted arc, and extended three point line (6.6 m [21' 8\"] from the basket at the corners; 6.75 m [22' 1.75\"] elsewhere) took effect in the tournament.\nThe final round was held in two arenas: in the Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid and Palau Sant Jordi, as opposed to a singular arena in 2010. Also, the arrangement of the round of 16 match-ups in the bracket were changed. In 2010, a team from Group A or B can meet a team from Group C or D as early in the quarterfinals, and cannot meet their groupmates until the semifinals. In 2014, teams from Groups A and B were in one half of the bracket played in Madrid, while teams from Groups C and D were in the other half and played in Barcelona; teams from Groups A and B could not meet teams from Group C or D until the final or third-place playoff, and could meet their groupmates as early as the quarterfinals.\nIn 2010, the round of 16 games were held in a span of four days, or two matches per day; in 2014, there would be four games per day, and the round of 16 will be done in two days. From the semifinals onward, unlike in 2010 where the semifinals were held in one day, and the third-place playoff and the final on the next day, the semifinals in 2014 were held on two days, followed by the third-place playoff the next day, and the final on the day after, or one game per day. Finally, the classification round for 5th place was also eliminated.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 3 February 2014 at 19:00 CET at the Palau de la Música Catalana, Barcelona. On 2 February, FIBA released the pots on how the teams would be drawn. \"Pot 1\" included the top 4 teams in the FIBA World Rankings, while the other pots were grouped on geographical and sporting criteria.\nFormer Spanish international Juan Antonio San Epifanio, Croatia's Dino Rađa, José Ortiz of Puerto Rico and Angolan Jean-Jacques Conceição assisted in the draw.\nGroup A, which included European champions France, hosts Spain, and traditional powerhouse Serbia has been labeled as the \"group of death\". The Americans, meanwhile, avoided the \"bracket of death\" of Groups A and B by landing in Group C, setting up a rematch of the 2010 final against Turkey, which were selected as wild cards, and a possible late knockout match-up against European runners-up Lithuania.\nSquads.\nEach team had a roster of 12 players; a team could opt to have one naturalized player from its roster. The final rosters had to be finalized at the team managers' meeting at the night prior to the first game. The final roster of 12 players per team must have been taken from a list of at most 24 players submitted to FIBA two months before the beginning of the championship.\nPreparation matches.\n2014 South American Basketball Championship.\nThe 2014 South American Basketball Championship in Isla Margarita, Venezuela was a qualifying tournament for the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship and for the 2015 Pan-American Games. defeated World Cup participants (who played with its \"B\" team) to win the title; the other team in the World Cup, (who also played with its \"B\" team), finished in third place defeating .

Australia fell to third place, thereby allowing them to face the United States at the semifinals instead of the quarterfinals if they finished second. This so-called \"tanking\" was blasted by Goran Dragić, whose Slovenian team were defeated by Lithuania in the final group match, dropping them to second place, causing them to face the Americans instead in the quarterfinals if they reach that far. Dragic implored on FIBA \"to do something about\" it.\nRight after Australia's elimination by Turkey in the first round, FIBA announced that the Boomers were under investigation for tanking. Australia coach Andrej Lemanis rejected the accusation that they tanked, saying he rested his players for the next stage due to the heavy tournament schedule, adding that: \"We always, as Australians, compete the right way\".\nOn 26 November 2014, Australia was cleared of tanking by FIBA.\nMarketing.\nRoad show and trophy tour.\nA tour of the Naismith Trophy was held to promote the event. The trophy was on display at the 2014 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans in February 2014, then the tour visited several countries in Latin America, Europe and the Philippines from April to mid-July. It also visited South Africa during the finals of the South African Premier Basketball League in August.\nPrior to this, FIBA and the Spanish Basketball Federation held a road show that ran from 2012 to 2014 visiting key Spanish cities, with some of the final stops being the host cities, and at Ljubljana, Slovenia during FIBA EuroBasket 2013.\nBall.\nOn 30 January, FIBA revealed the official ball that would be used in the World Cup. Designed by Molten, it \"will be the first time ever a custom designed basketball has been developed exclusively for an individual event\".\nMascots.\nOn 31 January, FIBA revealed the mascots of the World Cup: Olé and Hop. Olé and Hop's name came from the word \"alley-oop\"; they are directly inspired from the 2014 World Cup logo, and will have a tour of host cities leading up to the championship.\nTheme song.\n\"Sube la Copa\" by Huecco was named the official theme song of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The song, starting from 27 August, can be downloaded on iTunes, Spotify and Deezer, with all of the proceeds going to the FEB's Casa Espana, Huecco's Fundacion Dame Vida, and FIBA's International Basketball Foundation.\nReferees.\nThe following referees were selected for the tournament."

        "text": "George Fairbairn (born 25 July 1954) is a Scottish former rugby union and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s, and coached rugby league in the 1980s and 1990s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Borders, and at club level for Kelso RFC, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain and England, and at club level for Wigan, winning the Man of Steel Award in 1980, and Hull Kingston Rovers, as a goal-kicking , and coached at representative level rugby league for Scotland, and at club level Wigan, Hull Kingston Rovers, and Huddersfield.\nFairbairn retired as England's top point scorer in test football. In September 2012, he was named in Hull Kingston Rovers' greatest ever team.\nBackground.\nBorn in Peebles, Scotland, and raised in Coldstream, Scotland.\nPlaying career.\nWigan.\nIn 1974, he changed rugby football codes from rugby union to rugby league when he transferred from Kelso to Wigan. Although born in Scotland, Fairbairn qualified to play international rugby league for England due to his father being English. He became only the second Scottish-born person after Andrew Hogg to play for the England national team. Fairbairn won caps for England while at Wigan in the 1975 Rugby League World Cup against Wales (2 matches), New Zealand (2 matches), Australia (2 matches), and France, and later in 1975 against Papua New Guinea.\nHe won caps for Great Britain while at Wigan in 1977 Rugby League World Cup against France, New Zealand, and 2 matches against Australia including the 13–12 World Cup final loss at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

He also played for England in 1977 against Wales, and France.\nFairbairn played in all three tests for Great Britain in 1978 against the touring Australians during the Ashes series. He also played for England in 1978 against France. He played for Great Britain in 1979 against Australia and New Zealand (3 matches) on the Lions lackluster tour of both countries.

He then played for England in 1980 against Wales, and France, and for Great Britain in 1980 against the touring New Zealand Kiwis (2 matches).\nFairbairn was appointed as a player-coach at Wigan for the 1980–81 season, helping the club win promotion back to the first division. After the club's coaching duties were given to Maurice Bamford at the end of the season, Fairbairn requested a transfer, and was sold to Hull Kingston Rovers for a record fee of £72,500.\nHull Kingston Rovers.\nWhile at Hull Kingston Rovers Fairbairn played for England in 1981 against France and Wales. He also played for Great Britain in 1981 against France and in 1982 against the touring Australians (2 matches).

That Kangaroo touring team became the first team to go undefeated through a tour of Great Britain and France, earning themselves the nickname The Invincibles.\nIn October 1983, Fairbairn played fullback for Hull KR in their 8–6 victory over the touring Queensland state team from Australia at Craven Park. Fairbairns's two goals proved to be the difference between the two teams who had each scored a single try with Queensland and future Australian captain Wally Lewis only managing one goal from three attempts.\nGeorge Fairbairn played fullback in Hull KR's 14–15 defeat by Castleford in the 1985–86 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday 3 May 1986, in front of a crowd of 82,134.\nHe then played in Hull KR's 12–29 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1984–85 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park in Hull, on Saturday 27 October 1984, and played fullback, (replaced by John Lydiat) in the 22–18 victory over Castleford in the 1985–86 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1985–86 season at Headingley in Leeds on Sunday 27 October 1985.\nFairbairn played and scored two conversions in Hull KR's 4–12 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1981–82 John Player Trophy Final during the 1981–82 season at Headingley on Saturday 23 January 1982, and played in the 12–0 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1984–85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park on Saturday 26 January 1985.\nIn 1986, Fairbairn played for Hull KR is their 46–10 defeat by Australia as part of their 1986 Kangaroo tour.

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected outfielder Chuck Klein and Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, both deceased. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 3, 1980, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1960 or later, but not after 1974; the ballot included candidates from the 1979 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected by the BBWAA, along with players whose last appearance was in 1974. As had happened in the 1979 voting, the BBWAA choose to put all eligible first-year candidates on the ballot rather than limiting them to those chosen by a selection committee. All ten-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to ten candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be inducted into the Hall. The ballot consisted of 61 players; a total of 385 ballots were cast, with 289 votes required for election. A total of 2,963 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.70 per ballot.

        "text": "The 2000–01 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represented Duke University during the 2000–01 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, and were coached by 21st-year head coach Mike Krzyzewski.\nDuke won the 2001 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament and defeated Monmouth, Missouri, UCLA, USC, Maryland, and Arizona to win their third national championship in Duke's history, under the leadership of All-American duo Shane Battier and Jason \"Jay\" Williams.\nExpectations.\nShane Battier entered his senior season as the remaining member of Duke's heralded recruiting class of 1997 which included Elton Brand and William Avery and had nearly led Duke to a championship two years earlier. (Brand and Avery, along with Corey Maggette would become the first Duke underclassmen to leave early for the draft that year.) Despite losing the reigning ACC Player of the Year Chris Carrawell to graduation, the Blue Devils still retained sophomores Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Carlos Boozer and welcomed the addition of freshman Chris Duhon to their lineup.\nRegular season.\nOn January 27, 2001, the #2 Duke Blue Devils played at #8 Maryland Terrapins in what would become the first of four contests between these two ACC powerhouses. With Duke trailing by 10 points, with 54 seconds left in regulation, Williams scored eight points. These points included two 3 pointers in a 13 second span. James hit two free throws to send this game into overtime. In overtime, Battier blocked a layup by Juan Dixon at the baseline with 4 seconds left to preserve a 98 to 96 victory.\nHowever, the Blue Devils stumbled in the next game at home against their rival, 4th ranked North Carolina by a score of 85 to 83. A month later, Maryland would avenge their home loss to Duke when the No. 16 Terrapins defeated the No. 2 Blue Devils 91 to 80 on Shane Battier's Senior Night in Cameron Indoor Stadium. After center Carlos Boozer had to leave with a foot injury in that game, Coach Krzyzewski decided to change his strategy, favoring a smaller, quicker lineup by having Duhon start at point guard and moving Williams over to shooting guard. His plan was successful in Duke's next game at North Carolina, when Duke defeated the No. 4 Tar Heels 95 to 81 to claim a share of the regular season championship. The Blue Devils went on to win 6 of its games following Boozer's injury. Then Boozer rejoined the team in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament.\nConference tournament.\nDuke finished the regular season with a 26–4 record entering the ACC tournament as a No. 2 seed. In the tournament semifinals, they met Maryland for the third time this season. In another thrilling contest, after Maryland had rallied from a 14 point, second-half deficit, the Blue Devils defeated the Terrapins 84 to 82 when Nate James tipped in the game-winner with 1.3 seconds left to advance to the title game against North Carolina. In the third game between Duke and UNC that season, the Blue Devils emerged victorious as ACC tournament champions by the score of 79 to 53 and received a No. 1 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Blue Devils would travel the same path they took nine years ago when they claimed their last championship in 1992, from Greensboro to Philadelphia to Minneapolis, where they met Maryland for the fourth time that season, this time in the Final Four with a berth in the championship game at stake. Finding themselves down 39 to 17 with 6:57 to play in the first half and down 49 to 38 at Halftime, Duke went on to stage a comeback against the Terrapins and win 95–84 to advance to the championship game. Duke's 22-point deficit and 11-point Halftime deficit marked the largest comeback in Final Four history.\nFacing fifth-ranked Arizona led by Gilbert Arenas and Richard Jefferson and coached by Lute Olson, who had lost his wife to cancer earlier during the season, Duke was able to stave off a comeback attempt in the second half and clinch the title by a final score of 82–72. With his third national championship, coach Mike Krzyzewski tied his mentor Bob Knight for third place behind Adolph Rupp (4) and John Wooden (10).

        "text": "The Northwest War Industries League and American Football League were two closely related professional football minor leagues based on the West Coast of the United States that played for two nonconsecutive seasons during World War II.\n1942 NWIL season.\nThe Northwest War Industries League (NWIL) played one season in 1942, with the Seattle Shipbuilders, Portland Boilermakers (later Portland Rockets), and teams in Spokane, Washington and Vancouver, Washington, while plans for team in Tacoma fall through. The league commissioner was Chester \"Cotton\" Wilcox, and the plans were that 52% of all league profits would go to military servicemen's funds. As a result of players shortage, the league allowed the teams to play with college students.\nInformation regarding league demise has mostly been lost to time, but is known that only Seattle played in 1943, and that plans to append the league to the Pacific Coast Professional Football League as a semi-autonomous Northern Division fell through.\n1944 AFL season.\nIn 1944, Portland returned to play. At the same time, the PCPFL revoked the membership of the Los Angeles Mustangs to protest owner Bill Freelove’s raiding of Jerry Corcoran’s Los Angeles Bulldogs roster. Freelove responded by reorganizing the old Northwest Industries league into a \"new\" league, the American Football League (with famous Hollywood lawyer Jerry Giesler as president). In 1944, an unprecedented five Los Angeles area teams were competing in one of the two rival leagues.\nBoth leagues had undefeated champions (the PCPFL San Diego Bombers had won their third consecutive title). AFL members San Diego Gunners, Los Angeles Wildcats (no relation to the 1926 AFL team), and Oakland Hornets folded before the end of the season. All three San Francisco Clippers losses were to the Hollywood Rangers.\nOn December 21, 1944, PCPFL league president J. Rufus Klawans announced a merger between the two leagues. Immediately afterward, the AFL champion Hollywood Rangers and PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers scheduled two games, one at each team’s home, to decide the “unified” Pacific Coast championship. Hollywood swept San Diego, winning 42-7 and 21-10, for the bragging rights.\nHowever, what was trumpeted as a merger was in fact not much of a merger at all. Seattle and Portland, the two teams that had formed the basis of the original league on which the AFL had been built, declined to play in the new league. The PCPFL also demanded that the Rangers merge with the PCPFL's Hollywood Bears, something the Rangers were unwilling to do since the Bears had not played football in two years and the Rangers were the defending champions. Nonetheless, the Bears ended up restocking themselves mostly on the Rangers' players. One major point of contention between the two leagues went unaddressed: even though the leagues had agreed on a merger, they again refused entry to the Los Angeles Mustangs. In the end, of the five teams in the AFL at the end of the season, only one team ever played in the PCPFL, the San Francisco Clippers. The Rangers and Mustangs, having their league (that they organized) ripped out from under them, continued play as independents for 1945 and quietly folded."

        "text": "India has competed in all except four editions of the Commonwealth Games; starting at the second Games in 1934. India has also hosted the games once, in 2010. The most successful event for India in these games is shooting.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1930s–1960s).\nIndia have been fairly regular at the Commonwealth Games, featuring in all but four editions (1930, 1950, 1962 and 1986) of the quadrennial showpiece. Indian athletes debuted at the Commonwealth Games, then called the British Empire Games, back in 1934. The Indian contingent at London 1934 Games featured six athletes, who competed in 10 track and field events and one wrestling event. India won one medal at their debut Commonwealth Games. Wrestler Rashid Anwar was the first Indian to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games after clinching the bronze medal in the men's 74 kg freestyle wrestling event at 1934 British Empire Games. Since their debut in 1934, India have won 564 medals – 203 golds, 190 silvers and 171 bronze - at the Commonwealth Games. However, the first few editions were very challenging for the nation. Post-independence, India mainly participated in athletics but medals were few and far between until things took a turn for the better in 1958. Legendary sprinter Milkha Singh became the first Indian to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, clinching the top spot in the men's 440 yard event at Cardiff 1958. India bagged another gold in the same edition when heavyweight wrestler Lila Ram won in the men's 100kg freestyle category. Cardiff 1958 was a historic year for women's participation too as track and field athletes Stephanie D’Souza and Elizabeth Davenport became the first Indian women to compete at the Commonwealth Games.\nRise (1970s–present).\nThe rise of Indian wrestling in the 1970s and the 1980s played a significant role in the country's improving fortunes at the Commonwealth Games. While the men dominated the winners list in the initial years, Indian women have also upped their performances since the turn of 70s. Indian badminton players Ami Ghia and Kanwal Thakar Singh were the first Indian women to win a Commonwealth Games medal, pocketing a women's doubles bronze during Edmonton 1978. Along with the wrestlers, the Indian weightlifters stepped up and earned numerous accolades for the nation, with Raghavan Chanderasekaran proving to be the jewel in the crown. Two-time Olympian weightlifter Raghavan Chanderasekaran won three gold medals, including snatch, clean and jerk and overall, in the flyweight division at Commonwealth Games 1990 and followed it up with three silvers in bantamweight at the 1994 edition in Victoria, Canada. Pistol shooter Jaspal Rana is the most successful Indian athlete at the Commonwealth Games, with 15 medals – nine golds, four silvers and two bronze. He dominated the shooting circuit in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Indian shooters played a crucial role during India's best showing at the Commonwealth Games, which came in 2010. At New Delhi 2010, India won 101 medals - 39 gold medals, 26 silvers and 36 bronze to finish second on the medals leaderboard. New Delhi 2010 remains India's most successful Commonwealth Games until date. Since the 2000s, India have consistently finished among the top five countries in the medals table and are now a force to be reckoned with at the Commonwealth Games. At Commonwealth Games 2018 in Gold Coast table tennis ace Manika Batra was the most successful Indian with four medals. India finished third with 66 medals at the edition.\nHost.\nIndia hosted the Games in 2010, at Delhi. It was India's most successful Commonwealth Games to date with Indian athletes winning 38 gold, 27 silver and 36 bronze medals.\nOverall Medal Tally By Games.\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, India ended its campaign with a total of 61 medals (22 gold, 16 silver, 23 bronze). India with an overall total of 564 medals (203 gold, 190 silver, 171 bronze) is ranked 4th at the All-time Commonwealth Games medal table. India's first ever Commonwealth medal was won by Rashid Anwar, who won a bronze in the category of wrestling in 1934."

While the game scorer keeps track of points scored and fouls committed, statisticians also record other details of the game, such as assists, turnovers, and field goal percentage.\nGame statistics can be recorded using tally sheets, or computer software designed for the purpose.

        "text": "Daniel Richard Green (born June 22, 1987) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In his NBA career, Green has played for six teams. As of 2020, Green is one of just four players in history to have won NBA championships with three different teams; he won titles with the San Antonio Spurs in 2014, the Toronto Raptors in 2019, and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020.\nGreen spent his college basketball career at the University of North Carolina (UNC) from 2005 to 2009. He played in more games (145) and had more wins (123) than any Tar Heel before him. In 2009, during his senior year at UNC, Green won an NCAA championship.\nGreen was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 46th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After being waived by the Cavaliers, Green played for the San Antonio Spurs, the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Developmental League, and KK Olimpija in Slovenia.

During the 2013 NBA Finals, Green set an NBA record for most three-point field goals made in a Finals series (23). He then won an NBA championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2014. Green is just the third player from UNC to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship, the other two being James Worthy and Michael Jordan. Known for his perimeter defense, Green was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in the 2016–17 season. In 2019, he won a second NBA championship in his only season with the Toronto Raptors. Green won a third championship in 2020 with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nHigh school career.\nAs a high school freshman, Green attended North Babylon High School in North Babylon, New York, on Long Island and in addition to basketball, he played quarterback on the football team.

He averaged 5.2 points and 2.8 rebounds in his sophomore season. After his second year at North Carolina, Green considered transferring, but would ultimately finish his college career there.\nIn Green's junior year, he averaged 11.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.9 turnovers, 1.2 steals, 1.2 blocks in 22.3 minutes per game.

He shot 37.3% from the three-point line.\nApproaching his senior season, Green declared himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft. However, he refrained from signing with an agent so that he had the option to return to school, which he decided to do on June 16, 2008. He was named team captain alongside Bobby Frasor and Tyler Hansbrough for the year, and started every game as the Tar Heels won their fifth national championship. Green averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.7 turnovers, 1.8 steals and 1.3 blocks in 27.4 minutes per game for the season, again improving his shooting percentages, averaging 47.1% and 41.8% from the field and three-point line, respectively.\nGreen was selected to the All-ACC third team, and the ACC's All-Defensive Team.

        "title": "Historic Railpark and Train Museum (Bowling Green, Kentucky)",
        "text": "The Historic Railpark and Train Museum, formerly the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Station in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is located in the historic railroad station. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 1979. Opened in 1925, the standing depot is the third Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad depot that served Bowling Green.\nHistory.\nThe first Bowling Green railroad depot was built in 1858 prior to the L&amp;N's rails reaching Bowling Green. The rail line from Nashville reached Bowling Green on August 10, 1859. The line between Louisville and Nashville was complete on October 18, 1859, and was celebrated by 10,000 Nashvillians.\nDuring the Civil War, the young L&amp;N found itself to be a point of contention between the North and South. Kentucky was integral to the war and President Lincoln summed up the situation in this manner: \"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game\". Bowling Green was critical to both sides with its proximity to the Confederate state of Tennessee. The L&amp;N branched just south of Bowling Green with routes to Clarksville, TN, and the line to Memphis, TN, opening the path to the Western war plans. By 1863 the L&amp;N was the only railroad to cross both Union and Confederate Territories. The actions of L&amp;N President James Gutherie resulted in a contentious relationship with the U.S. War Department, after the Battle of Perryville sealed Kentucky's alliance, but saved the L&amp;N's future.\nWhen the Confederates were forced to retreat from the city in February 1862, they burned downtown and all the supplies they could not carry, as well as the depot and trains. The Union troops occupying the city set about building a new depot. It was a wooden building and served the railroad and people of Bowling Green into the 20th century.\nIn 1878 malaria broke out from New Orleans to Memphis, Tennessee. Residents of Memphis wishing to escape the epidemic boarded the L&amp;N trains, but residents from other towns refused to let them leave the train at their towns. Bowling Green's station was the first place they could leave the train, but enormous bonfires were built in order to deter infection. The evacuation of Memphis lasted a few days, until Memphis was quarantined.\nBy the 1880s, the depot was becoming too small to adequately serve all those who used it, and was in dire need of repair. However, the president of the L&amp;N, Milton H. Smith refused to build a new station in Bowling Green after the citizens chartered a competing railroad, the Bowling Green &amp; Ohio, that was to run east to Scottsville and connect with the Chattnooga &amp; Ohio out of Gallatin, TN. In retaliation, Milton Smith moved the railroad operations to Paris, TN, causing economic hardships for Bowling Green. Milton Smith died in 1921 and the current depot was opened with much fanfare October 2, 1925. It was constructed of limestone from the former White Stone Quarry located in southern Warren County, KY.\nThe L&amp;N Railroad signed an exclusive contract with a taxicab company to pick up riders at the station so a rival company sued claiming an illegal monopoly in 1928. In \"Black and White Taxicab and Transfer Company v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab and Transfer Company\", the United States Supreme Court upheld the contract.\nBy the early 20th century, local agricultural goods, such as strawberries and tobacco, were shipped from Bowling Green's depot, as well as locally mined building stone and oil. This made Bowling Green's L&amp;N station the largest employment center in Warren County. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Bowling Green station was a stop for over 30 passenger trains, plus freight trains, on a daily basis. The L&amp;N and other railroads operated the \"South Wind,\" which made a stop in Bowling Green.\nDecline.\nWith the signing the Transportation Act in 1957 to create a national interstate road system and the burgeoning popularity of air travel, passenger service began to decline in the 1960s. Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971, and cut back service to a single train, the Chicago-Miami/St. Petersburg\" Floridian.\" and the last passenger train left the depot on October 6, 1979.\nPreservation.\nLeft abandoned for many years and ownership passing through the hand of several private owners, the depot was saved from the wrecking ball by a group of concerned citizens. They transferred ownership to Warren Fiscal Court and the City of Bowling Green in 1997. Funding for renovations was acquired through the federal Transportation Enhancement program. The Depot Development Authority (DDA) was organized by the local government to oversee the twelve year, five phase, renovation process. Daily operations were under the oversight of Operation P.R.I.D.E., Bowling Green's beautification organization.\nIn 1999, the Bowling Green Public Library (now the Warren County Public Library) opened Kentucky's first Digital Library in the former train platform area. In 2002, the newly formed Historic Rail Committee located its first railcar on display tracks behind the depot. In 2007, the library relocated its services, Operation P.R.I.D.E. joined the City offices, and the Friends of L&amp;N Depot (formerly the Historic Rail Committee) opened its museum and retail operations.\nThe Friends of L&amp;N Depot, Inc., a 501(c)3 organization, manages the building operations through an agreement with the Warren Fiscal Court and City of Bowling Green, KY. The DDA was dissolved in 2008 having completed their assigned task of depot restoration.\nMuseum.\nThe L&amp;N depot currently serves as the home for The Historic Railpark and Train Museum, with a two-story museum in the old colored waiting room, and special events venue space in the original white waiting room. Museum docents provide behind the scenes guided tours of the railcars, including several very rare railroad equipment. Current vintage cars on site include:\nThe museum is home to the award-winning sHOw Modular Model Railroad Club permanent model railroad exhibit. It also hosts the two-day \"Festival of Trains\" in first weekend in December."
