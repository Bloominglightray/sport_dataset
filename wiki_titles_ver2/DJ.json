Despite this terrible result, Bowen was selected again two weeks later to face Ireland, this time led out by Tom Clapp. On this occasion Wales won even though their Irish opposition scored more tries. Bowen played against both Ireland and Scotland again the following season.

With Dothan, he won 14 games, and he was promoted later in the season to the Columbus Senators of the American Association. Dickerson played in ten games with the Senators and had a win-loss record of 3–2. After the 1916 minor league season concluded, the Cleveland Indians signed him to a professional contract.\nDickerson began the 1917 Cleveland Indians season, having drawn praise from Indians owner Jim Dunn. He ended up spending most of the season being sent to various minor league teams. After spending spring training with the Indians in New Orleans, he had stops in Milwaukee, New Orleans, Waco, and Butte, the last of which disbanded a week after Dickerson joined the team. Dickerson was brought up to the major league roster on August 2, and made his only major league appearance in a game against the Philadelphia Athletics. In the game, he pitched the final inning and did not allow an earned run in a 5–4 loss.\nTwo weeks after playing in his only major league game, Dickerson joined the military to fight in World War I, and was stationed in San Antonio. In early 1920, the Indians released him, citing that he had not sufficiently improved since they had signed him, and he did not play professional baseball after that. He died in Los Angeles at the age of 45."

He threw what would be his only MLB shutout on June 24, scattering eight hits and four bases on balls to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies, 3–0.\nIn January 1959 Briggs was sent to the Indians in a waiver deal that also featured outfielder Jim Bolger, pitcher Morrie Martin and utilityman Earl Averill, Jr. Although he pitched effectively in three spring appearances for Cleveland, Briggs spent most of the 1959 season in Triple-A with the San Diego Padres, where he went 14–6 (2.60).\nThat led to Briggs's only full season of Major League experience, 1960. He worked in 21 games for the Indians, all but two of them as a relief pitcher, and compiled a 4–2 mark with one save. His contract then was sold to the Athletics on July 30. But Briggs treated roughly in his first five appearances for Kansas City, allowing 14 hits, seven bases on balls and 13 earned runs in seven innings pitched. During that skein, he lost his only starting assignment to the Boston Red Sox on August 4, failing to record an out and allowing a three-run, first-inning home run to veteran Vic Wertz. Briggs finished the 1960 season 4–4 with a 6.42 earned run average.\nThe following winter, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds with fellow right-hander John Tsitouris for veteran southpaw pitcher Joe Nuxhall. Briggs never appeared in regular season game for Cincinnati, playing two more years of Triple-A before his 1962 retirement.\nDuring his MLB career, Briggs appeared in 59 games and 165 innings pitched, allowing 174 hits and 82 bases on balls. He struck out 80, had three complete games and the one save he recorded in 1960.\nBriggs died on December 25, 2018."

He batted and threw left-handed, and signed with Cleveland after starring in baseball and basketball at the University of Minnesota. He began his baseball career in the Double-A Eastern League in 1964, and in his sophomore season he hit 33 home runs, batted .311 and drove in 106 runs for the Triple-A Portland Beavers in 1965. Recalled by Cleveland in September, he made ten appearances as a pinch hitter and counted a double among his three hits. He began and ended 1966 with the Indians, but spent most of the year in Portland. In 38 MLB at bats, Davis made only six hits, but one was his first (and only) Major League home run, against veteran Jack Sanford of the California Angels as a pinch hitter on September 9.\nDavis then spent the entire 1967 season on the disabled list after he ruptured his Achilles tendon while playing a pick-up basketball game in January. He would never play another game for the Indians, but after his third stint with Triple-A Portland in 1968, he was traded to the newly established Padres. He was the starting first baseman in the first official National League game ever played by the Padres on April 8, 1969, and went hitless in three at bats against the Houston Astros. He started ten more games in April, but did not hit enough to hold the regular job, and was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in May. The Cardinals immediately sent him to Triple-A, where he spent the rest of the 1969 season, his last in baseball. In addition to his home run, Davis' 19 total MLB hits also included three doubles in 64 career games played and 105 at bats.\nDavis then returned to his hometown of Richfield, Minnesota, where he worked in real estate and banking.\nDavis died January 13, 2023."

        "text": "Steven Michael Comer (born January 13, 1954) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, who player in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Cleveland Indians in all or parts of seven seasons.\nEarly life.\nComer was born January 13, 1954, in Minneapolis, the son of Kenneth Donald Comer (1928-2009) and Joyce Emily Nelson Comer (1928–2010). His father served as a sergeant in the United States Army during the Korean War. He had two older brothers, Kenneth Donald Comer Jr. and John Nelson Comer, and a younger sister, Laurie Gail Comer, who died before turning a month old in 1960.\nComer attended the University of Minnesota. In 1974, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was not drafted by an MLB club, instead working in construction before being signed by the Texas Rangers in 1976.\nMajor League Career.\nComer played for the Texas Rangers (1978–1982), Philadelphia Phillies (1983), and Cleveland Indians (1984).\nHis first year in the Major Leagues had Comer both starting and relieving, going 11-5 with an ERA of 2.30 in 30 games, 11 of them starts. He completed three games, threw two shutouts, finished 14 games and had one save.\nHis best season came in 1979 when he won a career-high 17 games for the Rangers and set personal bests for innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts. He also led the team in wins, with one more than Hall of Fame pitcher Fergie Jenkins, and was second to Jenkins in games started (36) and complete games (6) for the team.\nIn 1980, Comer came into the season in the rotation, but he started the year on a negative note, losing three of his first four decisions with an ERA around 10.00 when he was sidelined due to a shoulder injury. He wouldn't recover fully that year, finishing at 2-4 with a 7.99 ERA.\nIn 1981, his shoulder was healed, and Comer was a vital part of the Rangers bullpen, pitching in 36 games, finishing 22 of them, and earning 6 saves, tying him with Charlie Hough for the team lead. He also went 8-2 with a 2.56 ERA.\n1982 was more of a trying year for Comer, as he pitched in one more game than the previous year (37), and nailed down six more saves, but ultimately he struggled, going 1-6 with an ERA of 5.10. He was released by the Rangers after the season.\nPrior to the 1983 season, Comer was signed by the New York Yankees, but released before Opening Day; he then signed with the Seattle Mariners, who released him in June. Picked up by the Phillies, Comer appeared in only three games for them that season, going 1-0 with a 5.19 ERA in three games, one of those a start. Philadelphia would lose the World Series that year, though Comer was a non-factor in the postseason, not appearing on their roster.\nComer would wrap up his Major League career in 1984 with the Indians, for whom he went 4-8 with an ERA of 5.68 in 22 games, 20 of them starts. He was one of seven pitchers that year to start double digit games for Cleveland.\nPersonal life.\nOn November 3, 1979 in Hennepin County, Minnesota, Steve married Kathy Lynn Gatz (b. January 10, 1955). Together they have three daughters: Margaret Anne Comer Hansel (b. July 2, 1985); Lauren Elizabeth Comer Schlangen (b. November 10, 1987) and Stephanie Lynn Comer (b. November 6, 1990).\nComer is a descendant of the Newkirk family, an early Dutch settler family to Ulster County, New York, as well as the Hay family, being a second cousin, four times removed of United States Secretary of State John Hay. A second cousin is actor Dash Mihok, as his grandfather Kenneth Newkirk Comer is the older brother of Mihok's grandmother, Zoe Comer Cloak."

        "title": "Baseball in the United States",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of baseball in the United States. The sport is one of the most popular sports in the U.S. for both participants and spectators. The World Series of MLB is the culmination of baseball's postseason each October. It is played between the winner of each of the two leagues, the American League and the National League, and the winner is determined through a best-of-seven playoff.\nAs baseball developed over 150 years ago in the Northeastern United States, it has been played and followed in the region longer than any other region in the nation. As of 2022, the Philadelphia Phillies, founded in 1883, are the oldest continuous same-name, same-city franchise in both Major League Baseball and all of American professional sports.\nAn extensive minor league baseball system covers most mid-sized cities in the United States. Minor league baseball teams are organized in a six-tier hierarchy, in which the highest teams (AAA) are in major cities that do not have a major league team but often have a major team in another sport, and each level occupies progressively smaller cities. The lowest levels of professional baseball serve primarily as development systems for the sport's most inexperienced prospects, with the absolute bottom, the rookie leagues, occupying the major league squads' spring training complexes and making no effort to earn money on their own.\nThen, every four years in March, the World Baseball Classic is held, which is the national team game, the most popular baseball national team game. The Team USA won its first championship in 2017 and lost to Japan in 2023 to win the second place.\nSome limited independent professional baseball exists, the most prominent being the Atlantic League, which occupies mostly suburban locales that are not eligible for high level minor league teams of their own. Outside the minor leagues are collegiate summer baseball leagues, which occupy towns even smaller than those at the lower end of minor league baseball and typically cannot support professional sports. Summer baseball is an amateur exercise and uses players that choose not to play for payment in order to remain eligible to play college baseball for their respective universities in the spring. At the absolute lowest end of the organized baseball system is senior amateur baseball (also known as Town Team Baseball), which typically plays its games only on weekends.\nMajor League Baseball.\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization that is the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, in fact the oldest professional sports league in the world. A total of 30 teams now play in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), with 15 teams in each league. The AL and NL operated as separate legal entities from 1901 and 1876 respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities since 1903, in 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball. The organization also oversees minor league baseball leagues, which comprise about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs. With the World Baseball Softball Confederation, MLB manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.\nBaseball's first professional team was founded in Cincinnati in 1869. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the dead-ball era; players rarely hit home runs during this time. Baseball survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, which came to be known as the Black Sox Scandal. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, baseball's color barrier was broken by Jackie Robinson.\nNew York City is for many sports fans synonymous with the New York Yankees and their logo. The team is noted as having been the team of many of the all-time greats in the history of the game, and for having won more titles than any other US major professional sports franchise. The city was also host to two other highly popular baseball teams in the National League, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, before their transfer to California beginning with the 1958 season. The Yankees' chief rivals, the Boston Red Sox, also enjoy a huge following in Boston and throughout New England. The fierce National League rivalry between the former Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants was transferred to the West Coast when the teams became the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, and California has always been among the US states which have supplied the most players in the major leagues. Philadelphia sports fans have rooted for the Phillies since 1883, as they are the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in all of professional American sports. Philadelphia Phillies fans are known for their rabid support of their team throughout Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley, and have famously been dubbed as the \"Meanest Fans in America\". Chicago sports fans also avidly follow the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox despite the comparative lack of success for the teams over their histories.\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among Major League players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the Mitchell Report, which implicated many players in the use of performance-enhancing substances, including at least one player from each team.\nToday, MLB is composed of thirty teams: twenty-nine in the United States and one in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series, a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired throughout North America and in several other countries throughout the world. Games are aired on television, radio, and the Internet. MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in the world with more than 74 million spectators in 2013.\nMinor league baseball.\nMinor League Baseball is a hierarchy of professional baseball leagues in the Americas that compete at levels below Major League Baseball (MLB) and provide opportunities for player development and a way to prepare for the major leagues. All of the minor leagues are operated as independent businesses. Most are members of the umbrella organization known as Minor League Baseball (MiLB), which operates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized baseball.\nExcept for the Mexican League, teams in the organized minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one major league team through a standardized Player Development Contract (PDC). These leagues also go by the nicknames the \"farm system\", \"farm club\", or \"farm team(s)\" because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals' general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system, and teams in small towns were \"growing players down on the farm like corn.\"\nSince 2021, the Minor League Baseball hierarchy is separated into the classes of AAA, AA, High-A, Low-A and Rookie. This came as a result of the reorganization of Minor League Baseball, which added or contracted new teams, as well as the elimination of Short-Season A and Rookie-Advanced.\nMajor League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams may enter into a PDC for a two- or four-year term. At the expiration of a PDC term, teams may renew their affiliation, or sign new PDCs with different clubs, though many relationships are renewed and endure for extended time periods. For example, the Omaha Storm Chasers (formerly the Omaha Royals) have been the AAA affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969, but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations, after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979, to the Washington Nationals in 2007 and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Guardians since 2009.\nA few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club, such as the Springfield Cardinals, owned by the St. Louis Cardinals, and all of the Atlanta Braves' affiliates except the Carolina Mudcats. Minor League teams that are owned directly by the major league Club do not have PDCs with each other and are not part of the reaffiliation shuffles that occur every other year.\nA special minor league is the Arizona Fall League. It operates outside the Minor League Baseball hierarchy and is owned by MLB as a whole; teams generally assign prospects from the AAA and AA classes to the league's six teams.\nToday, 19 affiliated minor baseball leagues operate with 246 member clubs in large, medium, and small towns, as well as the suburbs of major cities, across the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nThe World Baseball Classic is the most well known international baseball tournament in the United States, and is broadcast on FOX. The World Baseball Classic is held every March, every three to four years in the United States and other countries, and is the biggest international baseball tournament in the world.\nThe United States national baseball team, more commonly referred to as \"Team USA\", has competed in all iterations of the tournament. They reached the quarterfinals in 2006, the semifinals in 2009, the quarterfinals in 2013, before finally winning their first championship in 2017.\nThe 2023 World Baseball Classic saw rivals Team USA and Samurai Japan play in the final. This matchup was watched by up to 5.2 million Americans , more than the number of viewers at the MLB postseason NLDS and Wild Card Series. Viewership peaked at 6.5 million as Shohei Ohtani struck out Mike Trout to secure Japan's 3rd World Baseball Classic Championship.\nIndependent baseball.\nIndependent baseball leagues also exist, primarily placing their teams in suburban municipalities that lack minor league baseball teams of their own. Most such leagues operate with a level of talent comparable to the middle and lower ends of the minor league system; the Atlantic League, which operates mostly in the Northeast megalopolis, aims to be comparable in level of play to the higher level minor leagues.\nCollege baseball.\nCollege baseball is played on the intercollegiate level at institutions of higher education. In comparison to football and basketball, college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players, as baseball's professional minor leagues are more extensive. Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball. However, if players enroll at a four-year college, they must complete three years to regain eligibility, unless they reach age 21 before starting their third year of attendance. Players who enroll at junior colleges (i.e., two-year institutions) regain eligibility after one year at that level, Bryce Harper being a notable example. In 2013, there are 298 NCAA Division I teams in the United States.\nAs with most other U.S. intercollegiate sports, competitive college baseball is played under the auspices of the NCAA or the NAIA. The NCAA writes the rules of play, while each sanctioning body supervises season-ending tournaments. The final rounds of the NCAA tournaments are known as the College World Series; one is held on each of the three levels of competition sanctioned by the NCAA. The College World Series for Division I takes place in Omaha, Nebraska in June, following the regular season. The playoff bracket for Division I consists of 64 teams, with four teams playing at each of 16 regional sites (in a double-elimination format). The 16 winners advance to the Super Regionals at eight sites, played head-to-head in a best-of-three series. The eight winners then advance to the College World Series, a double elimination tournament (actually two separate four-team brackets) to determine the two national finalists. The finalists play a best-of-three series to determine the Division I national champion.\nPlayers seeking a professional career in baseball after college typically continue playing by way of collegiate summer baseball during the summer months after each college season ends. Dozens of collegiate summer baseball leagues, all of them independent from each other and from any other baseball organization, exist, each varying widely in level of talent, ranging from the elite Cape Cod League down to leagues that draw primarily from regional colleges. The one feature common to all collegiate summer baseball leagues is the use of wooden baseball bats like those used in the professional game; college baseball uses metal bats.\nPopularity.\nDuring the 21st century baseball has experienced a decline of popularity in terms of television viewership and participation among children."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLIX",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLIX was an American football game played to determine the champions of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2014 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks, 28–24. The game was played on February 1, 2015, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the second Super Bowl held at the stadium and the third in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\nThe Patriots' victory was their fourth overall and first since 2005's Super Bowl XXXIX, ending a 10-year championship drought. They finished the regular season with a 12–4 record en route to their eighth Super Bowl appearance, tying the record held by the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, and sixth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Seahawks, led by their Legion of Boom defense, also obtained a 12–4 record and were making their third Super Bowl appearance, in addition to their second consecutive after winning Super Bowl XLVIII. As the defending champions, the Seahawks were seeking to become the first to repeat since the Patriots in 2004. For the second consecutive season, both teams were the top seed from their respective conference.\nSuper Bowl XLIX was kept within a one-possession margin until Seattle took a 10-point lead in the third quarter. New England responded by scoring 14 consecutive points during the fourth to take a 28–24 lead with just over two minutes remaining. The game is most remembered for the Seahawks' last play, in which they threatened to score a winning touchdown from New England's 1-yard line, but were intercepted in the final seconds by Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler. Butler's interception is regarded as one of the greatest plays in NFL history, and in relation to Super Bowl win probability, it is analytically the most important single play in NFL history. In contrast, Seattle's decision to pass instead of run the ball is considered one of the worst calls of all time. Brady, who set the Super Bowl record for completions at 37, was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying the record held by Joe Montana. Two years later, Brady would surpass both records in Super Bowl LI.\nNBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX set the record for most-watched program in American television history and is the fourth-most watched American television broadcast of all time, behind Super Bowl LVII, Super Bowl LVIII, and the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The game was seen by an average of 114.4 million viewers, with it reaching to 118.5 million during the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show featuring Katy Perry and peaking to 120.8 million during New England's fourth quarter comeback. It is considered one of the greatest Super Bowls and was ranked eighth on \"NFL.com\"s 100 Greatest Games, the third-highest Super Bowl game. Butler's game-winning interception was ranked fifth on \"NFL.com\"s 100 Greatest Plays, the highest defensive play.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nInitial plan for Kansas City as host city.\nNFL owners initially voted in November 2005 to award a Super Bowl to Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, the founder of the American Football League (AFL) in the 1960s who helped engineer the annual game. Then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue further announced on March 5, 2006, that Kansas City would host Super Bowl XLIX. However, the game was contingent on the successful passage of two sales taxes in Jackson County, Missouri, on April 4, 2006.\nThe first tax to fund improvements to Arrowhead and neighboring Kauffman stadiums passed with 53 percent approval. However, the second tax that would have allowed the construction of a rolling roof between the two stadiums was narrowly defeated, with 48 percent approval. In the wake of the defeat, and opposition by the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and several civic and business groups, Hunt and the Chiefs announced on May 25, 2006, that they were withdrawing the request to host Super Bowl XLIX.\nBidding process.\nAfter the Kansas City plan fell through, the following submitted bids to host Super Bowl XLIX:\nTampa and Miami both submitted bids after losing the Super Bowl XLVIII bid to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Arizona had declined to bid for Super Bowl XLVIII, citing the economy, to focus on bidding for Super Bowl XLIX.\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello confirmed in April 2011 that Tampa and Arizona were selected as finalists. The league then announced on October 11, 2011, that University of Phoenix Stadium will host Super Bowl XLIX. This is the second Super Bowl contested at University of Phoenix Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl XLII in February 2008, and the third Super Bowl played in the Phoenix area, as Super Bowl XXX was held at Sun Devil Stadium in nearby Tempe in January 1996.\nTeams.\nNew England Patriots.\nThe New England Patriots had a rough start to their 2014 season, starting the season with a 2–2 record and hitting a low point with a humiliating 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in week four. By this point, the Patriots faced heavy criticism in the media, especially quarterback Tom Brady. Former Patriots safety and teammate Rodney Harrison declared Brady \"looked scared to death\" in the pocket and \"doesn't have any confidence in his offensive line.\" However, New England recovered with an NFL season long seven game winning streak, beginning with a dominating 43–17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in week five, and went on to lose only two more games for the rest of the year (the latter of which was done while resting the starters the final week of the season), finishing the season with a 12–4 record and the number one seed in the AFC. They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring (468 points) and eighth in points allowed (313), and had the largest point differential in the NFL (with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points). The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31 in the AFC Divisional playoffs, and then defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45–7 in the AFC Championship Game.\nBrady had another fine season in his 14th year as the team's starter, earning his 10th Pro Bowl selection with 4,109 passing yards and 33 touchdowns, with just eight interceptions. His top target was Pro Bowl tight end Rob Gronkowski, who caught 82 passes for 1,124 yards and 12 touchdowns, along with wide receiver Brandon LaFell, who caught 74 passes for 954 yards and seven touchdowns. Wide receiver Julian Edelman was another key aspect of the passing game, with 92 receptions for 974 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing for 92 yards and returning 25 punts for 299 yards and a touchdown. Running back Jonas Gray was the team's leading rusher with 412 yards and a 4.6 yards per carry average, while Stevan Ridley added 340 yards and Shane Vereen had 391. Vereen was also a reliable pass catcher, hauling in 52 receptions for 447 yards. On special teams, kicker Stephen Gostkowski was selected to his third Pro Bowl and became the third player ever to lead the NFL in scoring four times (and the first since the NFL-AFL merger), converting 35 of 37 field goals (94.6 percent) and racking up 156 points. Matthew Slater also made the Pro Bowl on special teams for the fourth time.\nThe Patriots defensive line was led by five-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Vince Wilfork and defensive end Rob Ninkovich, who compiled eight sacks. Behind them, linebacker Jamie Collins led the team in tackles (116) and forced fumbles (four), while also intercepting two passes. Linebacker Dont'a Hightower was also a big contributor with 89 tackles and six sacks. The secondary was led by Pro Bowl cornerback Darrelle Revis, along with safety Devin McCourty, who recorded two interceptions and Brandon Browner, who added a physical presence to the secondary.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nAfter winning Super Bowl XLVIII the previous season, the Seahawks also struggled to begin the season, floundering near the season's midpoint with a 3–3 record. However, they went on from there to win nine of their final 10 regular season games, preventing their opponents from scoring any touchdowns in five of them. By the time they finished with a 12–4 record and entered the playoffs, they had earned the number one seed, and not allowed any touchdowns in the previous 10 quarters. Their defense ranked first in the NFL in fewest points allowed (254) and their offense was tied at first in rushing yards (2,762). The Seahawks defeated the Carolina Panthers 31–17 in the NFC Divisional playoffs, and then defeated the Green Bay Packers 28–22 in overtime in the NFC Championship Game. Seattle became the first NFC team to advance to consecutive Super Bowls since the 1996–97 Packers in Super Bowls XXXI and XXXII.\nQuarterback Russell Wilson was back in control of the Seattle offense, completing 63.1 percent of his passes for 3,475 yards and 20 touchdowns, with seven interceptions, while also rushing for 849 yards and six touchdowns. The team's leading receiver was Doug Baldwin, who caught 66 passes for 825 yards and three touchdowns. Receiver Jermaine Kearse was another reliable target with 38 catches for 537 yards, while tight end Luke Willson caught 22 passes for 362 yards. Running back Marshawn Lynch was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl, ranking fourth in the NFL with 1,306 rushing yards and first in rushing touchdowns with 13. He also caught 37 passes for 364 yards and four more touchdowns. Running back Robert Turbin chipped in 310 yards and 16 receptions. On special teams, kicker Steven Hauschka ranked fourth in the NFL with 134 points and made 31 of 37 field goals (83.8 percent).\nMichael Bennett anchored the Seattle defensive line, leading the team with seven sacks, while teammate Bruce Irvin ranked second with 6.5 and intercepted two passes, returning both for touchdowns. Behind them, linebackers K. J. Wright and Pro Bowl selection Bobby Wagner combined for a staggering 211 tackles (107 for Wright, 104 for Wagner), while Wright also forced three fumbles. But the strongest aspect of the team's number one ranked defense was their secondary. Known as the \"Legion of Boom\", they sent three of their four starters to the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row: cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor. Sherman led the team with four interceptions, while Thomas had 97 tackles and forced four fumbles. Chancellor had 78 tackles and also recorded six passes deflected.\nPlayoffs.\nNew England became the first playoff team to overcome two 14-point deficits to win a game as they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31, pulling ahead for the first time in the game on Brady's 23-yard touchdown pass to LaFell with 5:13 left in regulation. Then safety Duron Harmon iced the game by intercepting a pass from Joe Flacco in the end zone on Baltimore's ensuing drive. Although New England only had 14 rushing yards, Brady's franchise playoff record 33 completions for 367 yards and three touchdowns, along with a rushing score, were able to make up the difference.\nThe Patriots had a much easier time in the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts. Although the score was still a close 17–7 by the end of the half, New England dominated the game in the second with touchdowns on their first four drives. Brady had another great game, throwing for 226 yards and three touchdowns with one interception, while Blount rushed for 148 yards and three scores. New England's defense held Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who had thrown for 4,761 yards and 40 touchdowns during the season, to just 12/23 completions for 126 yards. By the end of New England's two postseason games, Brady set new NFL records for postseason passing yards and touchdowns, while coach Bill Belichick set the all-time record for most playoff wins.\nSeattle started off their postseason with a 31–17 win over the Carolina Panthers. The score was just 14–10 at the end of the first half, but the Seahawks took control of the game in the second, scoring 17 unanswered points. After a field goal and Russell Wilson's 25-yard touchdown pass to Luke Willson, Chancellor put the game completely out of reach by intercepting a pass from Cam Newton and returning it 90 yards for a touchdown.\nSeattle had to mount a furious comeback to defeat their next opponent, the Green Bay Packers, as they fell behind 16–0 before Jon Ryan's 19-yard touchdown pass to Garry Gilliam on a fake field goal in the third quarter got them their first score. They still found themselves trailing 19–7 with just over 5 minutes left when Wilson threw his fourth interception of the day. But after Green Bay was forced to punt, Wilson led the team 69 yards to make the score 19–14 on his 1-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing kickoff, receiver Chris Matthews recovered an onside kick for Seattle, and they took their first lead on a 24-yard touchdown run from Marshawn Lynch. Now with the score 20–19, the Seahawks managed to go up by 3 points on a dramatic 2-point conversion play in which Wilson was forced to run all the way back to the 17-yard line near the right sideline before hurling the ball to the opposite side of the field, where Luke Willson, who had only been assigned as a blocker for the play, caught the ball and took it into the end zone. Although Green Bay kicked a field goal to send the game into overtime, Seattle's comeback could not be stopped. After winning the coin toss, the Seahawks took the ball and drove 87 yards to win the game on Wilson's 35-yard touchdown pass to Kearse, sending the Seahawks to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.\nPregame notes.\nSuper Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl matchup, and the first postseason matchup, between the Patriots and Seahawks; while Seattle was part of the AFC before moving to the NFC in the NFL's 2002 realignment, the teams had never met beyond the regular season.\nThe game was notable for featuring the coach of one team who had replaced the other as head coach; Patriots head coach Bill Belichick was hired in 2000 to replace Pete Carroll, who went on to become the coach of the Seahawks. This was only the fourth time this has occurred. The other three times were in Super Bowl III (Weeb Ewbank's New York Jets vs. Ewbank's former team, Don Shula's Baltimore Colts), Super Bowl XXXIII (Dan Reeves's Atlanta Falcons vs. Mike Shanahan's Denver Broncos), and Super Bowl XXXVII (Jon Gruden's Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Gruden's former team, Bill Callahan's Oakland Raiders). The only previous time that the old coach's former team had won was in Super Bowl XXXIII.\nSeahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith, despite being the MVP of the preceding Super Bowl XLVIII, had been returned to a reserve role for the 2014 season and did not play in Super Bowl XLIX, since defensive coordinator Dan Quinn opted to retain Bruce Irvin, K. J. Wright and Bobby Wagner as the starting linebacker trio.\nThe betting odds for Super Bowl XLIX initially opened after the conclusion of the conference championship games with the Seahawks favored by 2.5 points, but within hours of opening, heavy betting on the Patriots had moved the line to a pick 'em at most sportsbooks. Over most of the two-week run-up to the Super Bowl, the line held steady with the Patriots as slight 1-point favorites, but, on the day before the Super Bowl, a surge of large bets on the Seahawks pushed the line back to a toss-up.\nAfter the AFC Championship Game, ESPN reported an NFL investigation discovered 11 of 12 footballs the Patriots had used during it were under-inflated, while none of the balls used by the Colts had been, although these findings were later shown to be false. Patriots coach Bill Belichick denied any knowledge that the footballs his team used were not inflated to NFL standards. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick became large targets as controversy swirled around what colloquially became known as Deflategate just before the week of Super Bowl XLIX. The effects of the incident would drag on for nearly two years, finally being resolved with Brady receiving a 4-game suspension at the start of the 2016 season.\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Seahawks elected to wear their college navy home jerseys with navy pants, which meant that the Patriots would wear their white road jerseys.\nSuper Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl to be played in a retractable roof stadium with the roof open by league decision (previous Super Bowls played in such stadiums, including Super Bowl XLII, were played with the roof closed). The gametime temperature was , with clear conditions. It was the second time all season, along with the Pro Bowl, the stadium had its roof open during an NFL game or the College Football Playoff's Fiesta Bowl. It is the home stadium of the Arizona Cardinals, but all Cardinals home games in 2014 had it closed either because of warm temperatures or to provide home field advantage and hold in crowd noise.\nThe Patriots had also appeared in the only other Super Bowl to be held at University of Phoenix Stadium to date, having fallen short in their quest for a 19–0 undefeated season with a 17–14 loss to the New York Giants there in Super Bowl XLII. In fact, this game marked the Patriots' return to University of Phoenix Stadium for the first time since that contest.\nTeam facilities.\nThe Patriots used the Arizona Cardinals headquarters, in Tempe, Arizona, while the Seahawks used the Arizona State University practice facilities, also in Tempe.\nTickets.\nTicket prices for Super Bowl XLIX rose quickly, with the lowest-cost tickets reaching over $8,000 by January 29. The average ticket price charged by brokers was $10,352, an increase of more than three times over the previous year's prices. The raise in ticket prices was due to a shortage caused by the short selling practice of brokers and resale sites. Jeff Miller, writing for the \"Orange County Register\", observed that the cheapest tickets were nearly as expensive as a year's tuition at the University of Phoenix, and commented that the $28,888 price of seats near the 50-yard line \"should not only buy you Katy Perry's halftime show but also Katy Perry singing again from your backseat halfway through your drive home.\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nSuper Bowl XLIX was televised by NBC in the United States, with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color analyst Cris Collinsworth calling the game from the booth and Michele Tafoya working as sideline reporter. Game coverage was preceded by a six-hour pre-game show featuring the \"Football Night in America\" crew, including Bob Costas, Dan Patrick, Josh Elliott, Tony Dungy, Rodney Harrison, Hines Ward, Mike Florio and Peter King. John Harbaugh served as a guest analyst. Michaels, Collinsworth and Tafoya also contributed to the pre-game coverage along with Liam McHugh, Carolyn Manno, Randy Moss and Doug Flutie. It became the most watched broadcast in the history of American television, only one year removed from Fox's previous year's record-setting telecast of Super Bowl XLVIII. The presentation of the Lombardi Trophy was handled by Dan Patrick of NBC.\nA Spanish language telecast of the game was carried by NBC Universo, with play-by-play announcer René Giraldo and color analyst Edgar López. Formerly known as mun2, the network's re-branding was scheduled to coincide with the game. As with other major events broadcast by the network, the telecast was cross-promoted with other NBCUniversal properties, with various NBC News and NBC Sports programs either broadcast from Phoenix or featuring reports from the game. Golf Channel cross-promoted the game with its early-round coverage of the Phoenix Open golf tournament (the weekend rounds of the tournament aired on CBS, as per agreements for CBS and NBC to swap tournaments if they conflict with the Super Bowl or Winter Olympics), and live episodes of \"Feherty\" from the Orpheum Theatre.\nAn episode of \"The Blacklist\", \"Luther Braxton\", served as NBC's lead-out program. Following a break for local newscasts, a live episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" from the Orpheum was also broadcast.\nAdvertising.\nNBC set the sales rate for a 30-second advertisement at US$4.5 million, a price $500,000 above the record set by the two preceding Super Bowls. For the first time, the network also offered 15-second ad spots. A large number of automotive advertisers reduced their advertising during the game, replaced by a wave of fifteen first-time Super Bowl advertisers, including Skittles, Carnival Cruise Lines, Loctite, Wix.com, Jublia, a coalition of Mexican avocado growers, and Always among several others. NBC posted the commercials on a Tumblr blog as they aired throughout the game; the blog was promoted through NBC's own live stream, as it did not contain all of the same commercials as the television broadcast. The network had more difficulty than in recent years selling out the advertisements, with the last ads selling out four days before the game.\nParamount Pictures, Universal Studios, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lionsgate paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Paramount paid for ' and \"Terminator Genisys\". Universal paid for \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", \"Pitch Perfect 2\", \"Jurassic World\", \"Minions\", \"Furious 7\", and the debut trailer for \"Ted 2\". Fox paid for '. Lionsgate paid for \"\" during the pre-game show. Disney paid for \"Tomorrowland\".\nInternational.\nSuper Bowl XLIX aired on Seven Network, 7mate, and ESPN in Australia, CTV in Canada, Sky Television in New Zealand, and Channel 4, Sky Sports, and BBC Radio 5 Live in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nNFL Network produced an international television feed of the game carried in some markets, with alternate English-language commentary provided by Bob Papa (play-by-play) and Charles Davis (color analyst).\nThe Canadian broadcast was the most-watched broadcast on television that week, with 8.26 million viewers, while the pregame ceremonies in the half-hour preceding the game attracted 5.16 million viewers, making it the second most-watched program of the week. In the United Kingdom, the game was watched by 191,000 viewers, making it the eighth highest-rated program on Sky Sports 1 that week. It was the most viewed broadcast on pay television in Australia that day, with 94,000 viewers.\nThe game aired live in France on channel W9.\nThe game was broadcast live in India on Sony SIX.\nStreaming.\nNBC livestreamed the game for free on NBCSports.com on computers and the NBC Sports Live Extra app on tablets. Mobile device rights were exclusive to Verizon Wireless NFL Mobile for its subscribers who pay for NFL Mobile and they had to use NFL Mobile app instead of NBC Sports Live Extra.\nRadio.\nNational coverage.\nThe game was broadcast nationally on Westwood One radio, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason as color analyst, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage, with Larry Fitzgerald, Tom Brady, Scott Graham, Rod Woodson and Kurt Warner contributing. Scott Graham also handled public address duties inside the stadium for pregame introductions and postgame awards.\nLocal market coverage.\nThe flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their local play-by-play calls. In Seattle, KIRO-FM (97.3) and KIRO (710 AM) carried the game, with Steve Raible on play-by-play and Warren Moon on color commentary. As a clear-channel station, KIRO's commentary was audible over much of the West Coast of North America after sunset. In Greater Boston, WBZ-FM (98.5) carried the game, with Bob Socci on play-by-play and Scott Zolak on color commentary. Per contractual rules, the rest of the stations in the Seahawks and Patriots radio networks carried the Westwood One feed.\nInternational radio coverage.\nWestwood One's coverage was simulcasted on TSN Radio in Canada.\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live returned to coverage after the previous year's NFL broadcaster, Absolute Radio 90s, dropped out of sports coverage. Rocky Boiman and Darren Fletcher return as commentators.\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nIdina Menzel performed the national anthem and John Legend performed \"America the Beautiful\".\nHalftime show.\nOn October 9, 2014, \"Billboard\" announced that Katy Perry would perform at halftime and the NFL confirmed the announcement on November 23, 2014. At the start of the halftime show, on-field participants held up light globes which created a bird's-eye view of the Pepsi logo. Perry entered the stadium riding atop a large, golden mechanical lion, opening her set with a performance of \"Roar\". She then proceeded to sing \"Dark Horse\", with 3D rendering on the field creating a chessboard visual where the turf constantly turned into \"different shapes and sizes\", as acrobats surrounded the singer. Following this, Perry joined Lenny Kravitz for a duet version of \"I Kissed a Girl\", which included her \"rubbing up against\" Kravitz and flames exploding behind them. During these three songs, Perry was clothed in a \"flame-adorned\" dress, with her black hair in a ponytail. The costume has been described as the \"clothing equivalent of a flame\", and \"dress of fire\". The stage and field rendering transitioned into a \"breezy\" beach setting, with dancers dressed as sharks, palm trees and smiling beach balls dancing around Perry. She underwent a wardrobe change, and progressed into a \"campy\" medley of \"Teenage Dream\" and \"California Gurls\". Rapper Missy Elliott subsequently appeared, performing her songs \"Get Ur Freak On\" and \"Work It\", while Perry played \"hype-woman\" beside her, having now changed once again into a custom Super Bowl 49 jersey. After Perry briefly disappeared, Elliott performed \"Lose Control\". Perry returned, now sporting a \"star-encrusted gown\" for her closing song, \"Firework\". She rose out of midfield on a narrow platform that was attached to a shooting star prop, and flew above the crowds. During this performance, fireworks exploded around Perry and the stadium. The star Perry flew around the stadium attached to was heavily compared to \"The More You Know\"s public service announcements logo. It is the most-watched halftime show of all time, with a total TV audience of 120.7 million.\nIn August 2014, it was reported that the NFL had a short list of three potential acts for the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, including Coldplay, Katy Perry, and Rihanna. It was also reported by \"The Wall Street Journal\" that league representatives asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made following the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the \"Journal\", received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nAfter the first two drives of the game ended in punts, New England got the first scoring opportunity with a drive to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third-and-six, quarterback Tom Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by cornerback Jeremy Lane and returned to the 14-yard line. Lane broke his wrist and tore his ACL on the play when he tried to break his fall with his arm extended after being tackled by Julian Edelman, and subsequently missed the rest of the game. The game remained scoreless until New England's first drive of the second quarter, which began with Brady's 17-yard completed pass to Danny Amendola. Brady later completed a 23-yard pass to Edelman on third-and-nine, and eventually finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brandon LaFell.\nSeattle began to make progress when Russell Wilson completed his first pass of the day, a six-yard completion to Jermaine Kearse on third-and-six and with 5:36 left in the second quarter. After a five-yard run by Marshawn Lynch, Wilson completed a 44-yard pass to receiver Chris Matthews on the Patriots 11-yard line, setting up Lynch's three-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Only 2:16 remained in the half after Lynch's touchdown, but the scoring was far from over. Brady completed 5/6 passes for 59 yards on New England's ensuing possession, the last one a 22-yard touchdown completion to tight end Rob Gronkowski with 31 seconds remaining. Taking the ball back on their own 20, Seattle started off their drive with a 19-yard burst from Robert Turbin and a 17-yard scramble by Wilson. Then Wilson completed a 23-yard pass to Ricardo Lockette, with a facemask penalty on defensive back Kyle Arrington adding additional yardage that gave the team a first down on the Patriots 11-yard line. Only six seconds remained until halftime at this point, but coach Pete Carroll decided to take a shot at the end zone rather than kick a field goal, a gamble that paid off as Wilson threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Matthews on the next play, tying the game at 14 with just two seconds showing on the clock.\nSecond half.\nSeattle took the second-half kickoff and drove 72 yards to the Patriots' eight-yard line, featuring a 15-yard run by Lynch and a 45-yard reception by Matthews. After Lynch was stopped on third-and-one in the red zone, Steven Hauschka finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, giving Seattle their first lead of the game at 17–14. On New England's next possession, linebacker Bobby Wagner's interception of a Brady pass and six-yard return gave the Seahawks the ball at midfield. Just as with their last interception, Seattle lost a key defensive player due to injury. Defensive end Cliff Avril lay on the field motionless. After finally getting to his feet, he entered concussion protocol and did not re-enter the game. Seattle's pass rush, particularly Bennett inside and Avril outside, had hurried Brady into several drive-ending incompletions as well as the first interception. \"At times that night in the desert Bennett and Avril controlled the line of scrimmage almost by themselves.\" With Avril out, the Patriots were able to double-team Bennett and give Brady more time in the pocket.\nFollowing Wagner's interception, Seattle's offense took advantage of the turnover, driving 50 yards in six plays and scoring on Wilson's three-yard touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin, who was penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct for an improper end-zone celebration. This made the score 24–14, and it would remain this way going into the fourth quarter. Until this game, no team in Super Bowl history had come back to win after facing a fourth-quarter deficit of more than seven points.\nWith 12:10 left in the game, New England mounted a 68-yard drive to cut their deficit to 24–21 on Brady's four-yard touchdown toss to Amendola. The drive included two 21-yard completions from Brady to Edelman, the first one converting a third-and-14 in what was described by Bleacher Report as \"the NFL's worst nightmare\". Edelman was clearly concussed by Chancellor's helmet-to-helmet hit, \"suffering an apparent brain injury, staggering around on the field in plain view of the biggest television audience ever, per Deadline.com, and receiving no treatment.\" Dave Birkett of the \"Detroit Free Press\" reported that \"a medical observer was overheard radioing someone a second time saying Edelman needed to be examined.\" \"I thought he was going to go to sleep the way he was running,\" fellow Patriots receiver Brandon LaFell told Matt Pentz of \"The Seattle Times\". Nevertheless, Edelman remained in the game and eventually caught the game-winning touchdown pass.\nFollowing a three-and-out for Seattle, New England got the ball back on their own 32 at the 6:52 mark. Brady started off the possession with two completions to running back Shane Vereen for 13 total yards, and followed it up with a nine-yard pass to Edelman. Following a penalty against New England, Gronkowski caught a pair of passes that moved the team up 33 yards to the Seattle 19. Over the next three plays, Vereen rushed for seven yards, Brady passed to LaFell for seven more, and Blount ran the ball two yards to the three-yard line. Finally, with 2:02 left in the game, Brady gave his team a 28–24 lead with a three-yard touchdown toss to Edelman.\nAfter a touchback gave Seattle the ball on their 20, Wilson started off the Seahawks' drive with a 31-yard completion to Lynch. Then after two incompletions, he picked up another first down with an 11-yard pass to Lockette. The following play gave Seattle an opportunity to win the game. Wilson threw a deep pass down the right sideline to Kearse, who was covered by rookie reserve cornerback Malcolm Butler. Both players dove through the air for the ball, and Butler managed to deflect it with one hand, but the pass fell right into the hands of Kearse, who tipped it to himself and caught the ball while he was lying on his back. Butler managed to recognize the catch and recover in time to shove Kearse out of bounds as he got up, preventing a Seattle touchdown, but the play netted 33 yards and gave the Seahawks a first down at the Patriots' five-yard line with 1:05 left in regulation. Announcer Cris Collinsworth compared the play to two other acrobatic receptions by Patriots opponents that had defeated them in prior Super Bowls: David Tyree's Helmet Catch in Super Bowl XLII (which took place at the same stadium) and Mario Manningham's sideline catch in Super Bowl XLVI. Al Michaels also compared it to Antonio Freeman's famous \"Monday Night Football\" catch known as \"He did what?\" (a play that Michaels had himself called).\nOn the next play, Lynch ran the ball four yards to the Patriots' one-yard line where he was brought down by Dont'a Hightower. Since New England did not call a timeout, Seattle was able to run the clock down to 26 seconds before taking the snap for the next play. The Seahawks called a pass play in which Kearse would run a pick on the right side of the field to draw defensive backs away from Lockette as Lockette ran a slant to the middle, but Brandon Browner blocked Kearse at the line of scrimmage, preventing him from reaching Butler. Lockette appeared to be uncovered at the one-yard line when Wilson threw him the ball, but before the ball arrived, Butler correctly read the play and rushed into position to make the interception. The turnover—after an unsportsmanlike conduct call for excessive celebration—gave New England the ball on their own one-yard line with 20 seconds remaining in regulation.\nThe game was not quite over at this point. Since the ball was placed on the one-yard line, Brady had to take the snap in the end zone. If he took a knee or the Patriots otherwise failed to advance the ball beyond the goal line, this would be a safety, awarding Seattle two points, cutting the New England lead to 28–26, and forcing the Patriots to kick the ball back to the Seahawks who could win with a field goal. However, Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett moved across the line of scrimmage, earning a five-yard encroachment penalty against the Seahawks and moving the ball to the six-yard line. Brady then took a knee, Seattle called its final time-out, and Seattle linebacker Bruce Irvin rushed some of the Patriots players, starting a brawl involving players from both teams that resulted in a personal foul penalty for Seattle for another 15 yards. Irvin received the first ejection in Super Bowl history for throwing a closed hand punch at Rob Gronkowski. Brady knelt one more time at the 21-yard line and the Patriots were victorious.\nGame statistics.\nBrady completed 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards and four touchdowns, with two interceptions. His 37 completions set a new Super Bowl record, surpassing Peyton Manning's 34 set the previous year against Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII. He also surpassed Joe Montana's record for career touchdown passes in Super Bowls, setting a new record with 13. His top receiver was Edelman, who caught 9 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for seven yards and returning three punts for 27 additional yards. Vereen caught 11 passes for 64 yards and rushed for 13. For Seattle, Wilson completed 12 of 21 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 39 yards. Lynch was the top rusher of the game with 102 yards and a touchdown, and also caught a pass for 31 yards. Matthews, an undrafted rookie who had not caught any passes in the regular season or postseason before the Super Bowl, caught four passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. Wagner had 12 tackles (10 solo) and an interception. Linebacker K. J. Wright had 11 tackles (10 solo). New England became only the fourth team to win a Super Bowl despite losing the turnover battle (after the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V and the Pittsburgh Steelers in both Super Bowls XIV and XL).\nIn winning, Brady became the third quarterback in NFL history with four Super Bowl victories. Brady was also named MVP for a third time, tying the record set by Joe Montana. The Seahawks became the first defending champion since the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII to lose in the Super Bowl the next year. This also marked the 10th consecutive Super Bowl without a repeat winner (with the last one being the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX).\nIn a poll conducted by NFL.com a couple of months after the game, Super Bowl XLIX was voted by its readers as the \"greatest Super Bowl game\" of all time. The article does report that the voting was structured to try to account for \"recency bias\" in relation to the game at the time when the poll was conducted, but voters still \"pushed it through the competition\". Most lists of greatest Super Bowls continue to list it in the top few games.\nReactions to Seattle's final play.\nAfter the game, Seattle faced heavy criticism for their decision to call a pass play on second and goal from the 1-yard line with 26 seconds and one timeout left instead of a rushing play. Following the play, Collinsworth stated, \"I'm sorry, but I can't believe the call. … I cannot believe the call. You've got Marshawn Lynch in the backfield. You've got a guy that has been borderline unstoppable in this part of the field. I can't believe the call.\" He further added, \"If I lose the Super Bowl because Marshawn Lynch can't get it in from the 1 yard line, so be it. So be it! But there is no way... I don't believe the call.\" \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Peter King called the play one of the worst calls in Super Bowl history, as did retired Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. Retired running back Emmitt Smith, the NFL's all-time leading rusher, went even further, calling it the worst play call in the history of football. Others, including University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath, defended the call, crediting Butler for the play he made and pointing out that the Seahawks only had one time-out left. Writing for Grantland, Bill Simmons said the Seahawks \"took too much heat for the final play call\" and noted Carroll opted to run the ball on fourth down at the end of the 2006 Rose Bowl, costing his team the game.\nButler's interception, thanks to his quick \"read-and-react to Ricardo Lockette's underneath route\", has been considered one of the top clutch plays in Super Bowl history. It would also be a launching point for Butler's career. Butler, an undrafted rookie who had started only one game during the season, had entered Super Bowl XLIX listed #5 on the Patriots depth chart. But after this game, he would go on to start in all but one of the Patriots games over the next three seasons, as well as leading the team in interceptions in 2016, a season in which he helped them win another Super Bowl.\nIn the game, Lynch had gained at least one yard on 22 of 24 carries. While the Patriots in 2014 were ranked fifth-worst (28th overall) in the league in holding opposing backs for no gain or a loss, they had stopped him for no gain on both a third-and-2 and a third-and-1, the latter in the red zone. On the season, Lynch had scored just once on his five attempts from his opponent's 1-yard line. From 2010 to 2014, he scored 45 percent of the time, ranking 30th out of 39 running backs; for his career to that point, he was successful on 42 percent of his attempts (15 of 36).\nSeattle offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell acknowledged making the call, but also remarked that Lockette could have been more aggressive on the play. Wilson said the play was a \"good call\", and lamented throwing the interception and \"not making that play.\" Carroll, though, said the last play was \"all my fault\", and called Bevell \"crucially important to our future.\" The head coach added that Seattle would have run the ball on a subsequent play, as well that \"we don't ever call a play thinking we might throw an interception.\" Butler's interception was the only one against all 109 pass attempts during the 2014 NFL season from the 1-yard line.\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com, Pro Football Reference.com, The Football Database Super Bowl XLIX\nIndividual leaders.\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl XLIX had seven officials.

        "title": "Batting average (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, batting average (BA) is determined by dividing a player's hits by their total at-bats. It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal: A player with a batting average of .300 is \"batting three-hundred\". If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement. In this context, .001 is considered a \"point\", such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter.\nHistory.\nHenry Chadwick, an English statistician raised on cricket, was an influential figure in the early history of baseball. He is credited with creating the modern box score, in 1859, and the practice of denoting a strikeout with a \"K\". Chadwick wrote in 1869: \"In making up a score at the close of the match the record should be as follows:–Name of player, total number of times the first base was made by clean hits, total bases so made, left on bases after clean hits, and the number of times the first base has been made on errors...\" This led to the recording of \"clean\" hits—times a batter reached base without benefit of an error. In 1869, another early baseball proponent, Alfred Wright, published an end-of-season summary that included the average number of times a batter had \"clean\" hits on a \"per game\" basis. In 1871, a writer for the \"New York Clipper\", Hervie Dobson, proposed that a batter's \"average is found by dividing his total 'times first base on clean hits' by his total number of times he went to the bat\"—hits divided by at bats. By 1874, some teams were calculating batting averages, and by 1876, it was being calculated by all teams of the National League.\nValues.\nIn modern times, a season batting average of .300 or higher is considered to be excellent, and an average higher than .400 a nearly unachievable goal. The last Major League Baseball (MLB) player to do so, with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting championship, was Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox, who hit .406 in 1941. Note that batting averages are rounded; entering the final day of the 1941 season, Williams was at 179-for-448, which is .39955 and would have been recorded as .400 via rounding. However, Williams played in both games of a doubleheader, went 6-for-8, and ended the season 185-for-456, which is .40570 and becomes .406 when rounded.\nSince 1941, the highest single-season average has been .394 by Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres in 1994. Wade Boggs hit .401 over a 162-game span with Boston from June 9, 1985, to June 6, 1986, but never hit above .368 for an MLB season. There have been numerous attempts to explain the disappearance of the .400 hitter, with one of the more rigorous discussions of this question appearing in Stephen Jay Gould's 1996 book \"\".\nTy Cobb holds the record for highest career batting average with .366, eight points higher than Rogers Hornsby who has the second-highest career average at .358. The record for lowest career batting average for a player with more than 2,500 at-bats belongs to Bill Bergen, a catcher who played from 1901 to 1911 and recorded a .170 average in 3,028 career at-bats. Hugh Duffy, who played from 1888 to 1906, is credited with the highest single-season batting average, having hit .440 in 1894. The modern-era (post-1900) record for highest batting average for a season is held by Nap Lajoie, who hit .426 in 1901, the first year of play for the American League. The modern-era record for lowest batting average for a player that qualified for the batting title is held by Chris Davis, who hit .168 in 2018. While finishing six plate appearances short of qualifying for the batting title, Adam Dunn of the Chicago White Sox hit .159 for the 2011 season, nine points lower than the record. The highest batting average for a rookie was .408 in 1911 by Shoeless Joe Jackson.\nThe league batting average in MLB for the 2018 season was .248, with the highest modern-era MLB average being .296 in 1930, and the lowest being .237 in 1968. For non-pitchers, a batting average below .230 is often considered poor, and one below .200 is usually unacceptable. This latter level is sometimes referred to as \"The Mendoza Line\", named for Mario Mendoza—a lifetime .215 hitter but a good defensive shortstop.\nSabermetrics, the study of baseball statistics, considers batting average a weak measure of performance because it does not correlate as well as other measures to runs scored, thereby causing it to have little predictive value. Batting average does not take into account bases on balls (walks) or power, whereas other statistics such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage have been specifically designed to measure such concepts. Adding these statistics together form a player's on-base plus slugging or \"OPS\". This is commonly seen as a much better, though not perfect, indicator of a player's overall batting ability as it is a measure of hitting for average, hitting for power, and drawing walks.\nAnomalies.\nIn , bases on balls (walks) were counted as hits by the major leagues in existence at the time. This inflated batting averages, with 11 players batting .400 or better, and the experiment was abandoned the following season. Historical statistics for the season were later revised, such that \"Bases on balls shall always be treated as neither a time at bat nor a hit for the batter.\"\nIn rare instances, players have concluded their careers with a perfect batting average of 1.000—through the 2021 season, there were 94 such players in major-league history, 83 of whom recorded exactly one hit in one at bat. Only one player with a 1.000 average has had three hits—outfielder John Paciorek (1963), who had three hits in three at bats; he also had two walks, and scored four runs Players who had two hits in their only two at bats include: pitcher Frank O'Connor (1893), catcher Mike Hopkins (1902), pitcher Doc Tonkin (1907), pitcher Hal Deviney (1920), pitcher Fred Schemanske (1923), pitcher Chet Kehn (1942), second baseman Steve Biras (1944), and pitcher Jason Roach (2003). Pitcher Esteban Yan, who played in 472 major-league games from 1996 to 2006, mainly in the American League (where pitchers have rarely batted since the introduction of the designated hitter in 1973), also had two hits in his only two at bats, one a home run.\nQualifications for the batting title.\nThe MLB batting averages championships (often referred to as \"the batting title\") are awarded annually to the player in each league who has the highest batting average. Ty Cobb holds the MLB and American League (AL) record for most batting titles, officially winning 11 in his career. The National League (NL) record of eight batting titles is shared by Honus Wagner and Tony Gwynn. Most of Cobb's career and all of Wagner's career took place in what is known as the Dead-Ball Era, which was characterized by higher batting averages by star players (although the overall league batting average was historically at its lowest during that era) and much less power, whereas Gwynn's career took place in the Live-Ball Era.\nTo determine which players are eligible to win the batting title, the following conditions have been used over the sport's history:\nFrom 1967 to the present, if the player with the highest average in a league fails to meet the minimum plate-appearance requirement, the remaining at-bats until qualification (e.g., five at-bats, if the player finished the season with 497 plate appearances) are hypothetically considered hitless at-bats; if his recalculated batting average still tops the league, he is awarded the title. This is officially Rule 10.22(a), but it is also known as the Tony Gwynn rule because the Padres' player won the batting crown in 1996 with a .353 average on just 498 plate appearances (i.e., he was four short). Gwynn was awarded the title since he would have led the league even if he had gone 0-for-4 in those missing plate appearances. His average would have dropped to .349, five points better than second-place Ellis Burks' .344. In 2012, a one-time amendment to the rule was made to disqualify Melky Cabrera from the title. Cabrera requested that he be disqualified after serving a suspension that season for a positive testosterone test. He had batted .346 with 501 plate appearances, and the original rule would have awarded him the title over San Francisco Giants teammate Buster Posey, who won batting .336.\nAll-time leaders.\nMajor League Baseball.\nDifferent sources of baseball records present somewhat differing lists of career batting average leaders. There is consensus that Ty Cobb leads this category. Further rankings vary by source, primarily due to differences in minimums needed to qualify (number of games played or plate appearances), or differences in early baseball records. Baseball-Reference.com includes the Negro League teams considered major leagues by Major League Baseball. The below table presents the top ten lists as they appear in four well-known sources, with the rankings and degree of precision (decimal places) as provided in the source. The main article linked above is sourced from Baseball-Reference.com, which is also presented here. None of the players listed below are still living; each is an inductee of the Baseball Hall of Fame, except for Lefty O'Doul, Pete Browning, and Shoeless Joe Jackson (who is ineligible due to his alleged role in the Black Sox Scandal of 1919).\nMinor League Baseball.\nThe highest recorded single-season batting average in Minor League Baseball is .462, accomplished by Gary Redus in 1978, when he played for the Billings Mustangs, an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds in the Rookie Advanced-level Pioneer League. Redus was 117-for-253 in 68 games, as the Pioneer League only plays from June to early September. Redus went on to play in MLB from 1982 through 1994, batting .252 during his MLB career.\nNippon Professional Baseball.\nIn Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the leader in career batting average is Isao Harimoto, a member of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, who hit .319 in his NPB career. Nori Aoki, an active NPB player, has a career NPB batting average of .316 . Ichiro Suzuki batted .353 in NPB, but does not have enough NPB career at-bats to qualify for the league's title. Sadaharu Oh batting average of .355 in 1973 season. Randy Bass had a batting average of .389 in 1986 season.\nKBO League.\nIn KBO League (KBO), the leader in career batting average is Jung-hoo Lee, who hit .340 in his KBO career. And he is an active player. Baek In-chun batting average of .412 in 1982 season. This is the highest batting average of one season in KBO League."

Defending champion Pádraig Harrington, who played in the same group as Woods, was in second place after a 68. David Toms, 2001 champion, also started well. He made many long birdie putts and par saves to shoot a 69, placing him in a group of six tied for third place that also included two-time champion Vijay Singh. World number two Phil Mickelson struggled slightly, shooting a 2-over par 74. John Daly, 1991 champion, withdrew after posting a 78, citing a back injury.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 14, 2009\"\nTiger Woods broke away from the pack with a run of three straight birdies on the back nine, finishing the round with a four-shot lead. It is his largest margin after two rounds at a major since the 2005 British Open at St Andrews, when he led by five. Conditions on the second day were tough, with strong winds playing with putts and uneven greens. Vijay Singh, Lucas Glover and Brendan Jones, who moved up the leaderboard into second place, all played in the morning. The other two in the group tied for second place, Pádraig Harrington and Ross Fisher, had to cope with the fierce afternoon winds.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 15, 2009\"\nTiger Woods played a safe round, avoiding throwing away shots. His lead was halved to two shots over Pádraig Harrington and 2009 Honda Classic winner Yang Yong-eun. Henrik Stenson, winner of that year's Players Championship, scored a round of 68 and was tied for fourth place along with U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover. Ernie Els was as close as one shot from the lead but finished with three straight bogeys.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 16, 2009\"\nStruggling with his putting all day, Tiger Woods was in jeopardy of losing a major for the first time when leading after 54 holes. The only player who was able to take advantage of this was Woods' playing partner, Yang Yong-eun. Defending champion Pádraig Harrington was in contention early, but made a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 8th, causing him to fall from tied for 2nd to tied for 10th. Lucas Glover also reached contention, but faded with 4 bogeys in a span of 7 holes. Tied on the short par-4 14th, Yang chipped in for eagle from just off the green. The eagle gave Yang the lead which he did not relinquish. Yang sealed the victory by drawing a approach around a tree to within ten feet (3 m) on the final hole, setting up a birdie against Woods' closing bogey and a winning margin of three strokes.\n&lt;br&gt;\nComplete leaderboard\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball team represents Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I, and the team competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Saint Joseph's competes as well as part of the Philadelphia Big 5. Their home court is the Hagan Arena. The team is coached by Billy Lange, who was hired on March 28, 2019, after Phil Martelli was fired as head coach on March 19, 2019, after 24 seasons.\nThrough the years they have produced a number of NBA players. Saint Joseph's primary rivalry is with the Villanova Wildcats. Other rivals include the Temple Owls, the La Salle Explorers, the Penn Quakers, who make up the rest of the Big 5. Saint Joseph's basketball program was ranked 43rd best of all time by Smith &amp; Street's magazine in 2005.\nHistory.\nMen's basketball is the most popular sport at Saint Joseph's University. The Hawks have competed in 21 NCAA Tournaments and 16 NIT Tournaments. Throughout the school's history, 29 different players have been drafted into the NBA. The Hawks have been ranked 77 times in their history, 51 of which have been in the top 10.\nThe Hawks appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments between 1959 and 1974. They were coached by Hall of Fame coach \"Dr. Jack\" Ramsay from 1955 to 1966. Ramsay compiled a 234–72 record in his 11 years at Saint Joseph's. They reached the Final Four in 1961 (although their 1961 third-place finish was later revoked by the NCAA). Ramsay went on to coach several NBA teams and won the 1977 NBA Championship.\nJack McKinney took over after Ramsay left and led the Hawks to four more NCAA tournaments between 1969 and 1974.\nFollowing the 1974 season, the Hawks, with 11 fellow larger schools from the Middle Atlantic Conference, formed the new East Coast Conference.\nIn 1980–81, the Hawks, led by coach Jim Lynam, finished in second place in ECC play and won the ECC Tournament to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament. As a #9 seed, the Hawks defeated Creighton in the first round and upset the #1 seeded and #1 ranked DePaul to reach the Sweet Sixteen. The Hawks defeated Boston College to advance to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Indiana. Lynam also left the Hawks to enjoy a long career as a coach and executive in the NBA.\nSaint Joseph's joined the Atlantic 10 Conference prior to the 1982–83 season.\nThe Hawks' basketball program has also produced several NBA coaches. The first St. Joseph's player to become a professional team coach was George Senesky, who led the Philadelphia Warriors from 1955 to 1958. When Jack Ramsey left Saint Joseph's in 1968 he became the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. Ramsey then coached the Buffalo Braves from 1972 to 1976 before moving to the Portland Trail Blazers where he won the NBA championship in 1977. This victory upset the favored 76ers who featured Julius Erving and George McGinnis. From Portland he moved on to coach the Indiana Pacers from 1986 to 1988, after which he retired.\nAnother noted St. Joseph alum who coached for many years in the NBA was Jack McKinney. Coach McKinney, who followed Dr. Ramsey as the Hawks' head coach, left St. Joseph's to become an assistant head coach for the Milwaukee Bucks for two years before joining Dr. Ramsey at Portland. In 1979, coach McKinney was selected as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. His tenure in LA lasted only 14 games when he suffered major injuries in a bicycle accident. Assistant Head Coach and another St. Joe alum Paul Westhead took over for the injured McKinney and led LA to the NBA Championship. He stayed with the Lakers for three years and left to coach the Chicago Bulls and then the Denver Nuggets. He left Denver and became an assistant coach for three other NBA teams retiring in 2009. Following recovery from his injuries and with the success of Coach Westhead with the Lakers, McKinney took the head coaching job at the Indiana Pacers. After four successful years with Indiana, Coach McKinney ended his career in a nine-game stint with the Kansas City Kings.\nHawk basketball standout Jim Lynam started his NBA coaching career in 1981 as an assistant in Portland. Two years later he got his first head coaching job with the San Diego/LA Clippers. After two years in the West Coach Lynam came back home to Philadelphia to be an assistant with 76ers and in 1987 he was named the team's head coach. He remained in that position for five years before leaving to coach the Washington Bullets. In 1987 he left head coaching to become an assistant for three NBA teams before retiring in 2010.\nJim O'Brien began his NBA coaching career in 1987 as an assistant with the New York Knicks and then two years later the Boston Celtics. In 2001, he was named the Celtics head coach and stayed through part of the 2004 season. A year later he was at the helm of the 76ers then left for a four-year stint with the Pacers. He finished his coaching career as an assistant for three teams retiring in 2017.\nMatty Guokas, a successful NBA player in his own right, became an assistant coach of the 76ers in 1983. He went on to coach Philadelphia from 1985 to 1988. He then left the Sixers and took the head coaching position with the Orlando Magic and retired after four seasons.\nPerfect regular season.\nThe 2003–2004 Saint Joseph's University Hawks were the last Division I College Basketball team to finish the Regular Season undefeated before the Wichita State Shockers did so in 2013–14. Saint Joseph's ended the regular season with a 27–0 record and secured a #1 national ranking and a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Hawks were led by a backcourt of Jameer Nelson and Delonte West, both of whom were drafted in the 1st round of the 2004 NBA draft. The Hawks advanced to the Elite Eight with wins over Liberty, Texas Tech, and #17 Wake Forest. In the Elite Eight, they lost to Oklahoma State 64–62.\nNelson was named National Player of the Year while coach Phil Martelli was named Coach of the Year.\nIn 2009, the 2004 Hawks were named the best single-season team of the decade by Sports Illustrated.\nCurrent era.\nThe 2004–05 team attempted to repeat the prior year's success without its two star players. The Hawks again won the A-10, but lost the A-10 tournament championship to George Washington and failed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT and advanced to the Championship game before losing to South Carolina, 60–57.\nThe Hawks were able to repeat their trip to the NIT in 2006, but the Hawks lost in the second round to Hofstra.\nThe 2007–08 team finished in 4th place in A-10 play with a 21–13 record. They lost to Temple in the A-10 tournament and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. There, they lost to Oklahoma in the First Round.\nThe Hawks made trips to the NIT in 2012 and 2013, losing in the first round both years.\nThe 2013–14 Hawks finished the season with a 24–10 record and a third-place finish in A-10 play. The Hawks won the A-10 tournament by beating #23 VCU and earned the school's first bid since 2008 to the NCAA tournament. The Hawks lost to eventual National Champions, Connecticut, in the Second Round (formerly the First Round).\nFollowing the NCAA appearance in 2014, the Hawks looked to build on their success in 2014–15, but suffered a setback, finishing the season with 13–18 record.\nThe most recent appearance in the NCAA Tournament came in 2016. The 2015–16 team finished the season with a 28–8 record, a game out of first place in A-10 play. DeAndre' Bembry was named A-10 Player of the Year. The Hawks won the A-10 tournament for the fourth time by defeating VCU. The Hawks were awarded a #8 seed in the NCAA Tournament and defeated 9 seed Cincinnati in the First Round before losing to 1 seed Oregon.\nThe Hawks won the inaugural Big 5 Classic in 2023, defeating Temple 74-65. St. Joe's went 2-0 in \"pool play\" defeating Penn 69-61, and defeating 18th ranked Villanova in the Holy War 78-65. This was the Hawks' 21st Big 5 Championship and 10th outright.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Hawks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 21 times. Their combined record is 19–25.\nNIT results.\nThe Hawks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 16 times. Their combined record is 16–16.\nRivals.\nThe main rival has been the Villanova University Wildcats which is locally referred to as the Holy War. Saint Joseph's also has a heated rivalry with the Temple University Owls, the La Salle University Explorers, and the University of Pennsylvania Quakers. Because games against Drexel University are in-city, the two teams are sometimes considered rivals but Saint Joseph's leads the all-time series 43–6. The all-time series between La Salle and the Hawks is 63–49 in SJU's favor. They are losing the all-time series against Temple 63–75, Villanova 25–50, and winning the series with Penn 45–32.\nTraditions.\nFans of the Hawks often chant \"The Hawk Will Never Die!\". In a September 2003 issue, Sports Illustrated listed that cheer among \"The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)\", calling it \"the most defiant cheer in college sports\".\nRetired numbers.\nThe Hawks have retired four numbers for seven players, with No. 4 retired in honor of four players:"

        "text": "Peter Harold Boyne Burge (14 February 1884 – 15 July 1956) was an Australian rugby footballer and coach. He represented his country in both rugby league and rugby union. The eldest of the four Burge brothers, Peter was one of the first Australian dual-code rugby internationals.\nRugby union career.\nPlaying rugby union with South Sydney in 1904 the twenty-year-old Burge was selected for the Metropolis (City) representative side against the Great Britain tourists. When the All Blacks toured in 1905 Burge played against them firstly for Metropolis and then in a New South Wales side.\nBurge, a lock claimed a total of three international rugby caps for Australia. In two of these matches, he served as captain. His debut game was against New Zealand, at Sydney, on 20 July 1907. He made two rugby union tours, to New Zealand in 1905 with the first full Australian team and later on the epic 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain under captain Paddy Moran. On both trips he only played one game due to injury. On the Wallaby tour of 1908 he broke his tibia in his first match against Devon. He took no further part in the tour and one of the replacements sent over to fill the touring squad was his brother Albert Burge.\nRugby league career.\nHe was one of the fourteen 1908–09 Wallabies including Chris McKivat, Charles McMurtie, \"Boxer\" Russell and Arthur McCabe who defected to rugby league after their return from the Olympics and the epic tour. In Burge's case he joined his brother Alby in the 1909 \"Wallabies v Kangaroos\" promotional match which then disqualified him from the amateur code.\nHe joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1910 but then the following year linked with Alby and Frank at Glebe.\nHe toured Great Britain on the 1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, captained by his former Wallaby and then Glebe captain, Chris McKivat. He made four tour matches appearances for Australia.\nAlong with McMurtie and Bob Stuart, Peter Burge made his international league debut in a tour match on that 1911 tour but did not play in any Tests. Collectively they were therefore Australia's 17th to 19th dual-code rugby internationals.\nCoaching career.\nLike Frank Burge had done in 1927, Peter in 1937 coached the St. George Dragons.\nDeath.\nPeter Burge died suddenly at his brother Frank's house in Hurstville, New South Wales on 15 July 1956, age 72. He was buried at Waverley Cemetery with his parents, Peter and Emily Burge."

        "title": "Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (1999)",
        "text": "Maguire v SOCOG 1999 was a decision of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which ruled on 18 October 1999 that a blind man had been directly discriminated against by the failure of a government agency to provide ticketing materials for the Sydney Olympic Games in braille.\nThe Commission held it was not reasonable for the agency to rely on alternatives such as telephone information lines or an assumption the respondent could have the materials read to him by another. The commission also held that the cost of providing materials in braille should be considered in the context of an agency's overall budget rather than an assessed cost-benefit of the number of potential users of that material.\nBackground to the case.\nBruce Lindsay Maguire (b 1957) a small business owner from Baulkham Hills, New South Wales, was born totally blind and without sight or light perception. On 31 May 1999 Maguire sought to purchase tickets for himself and his family for the Sydney Olympic Games. At the time tickets were only available via an application form in a ticket book issued by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).\nMaguire initially tried to have the ticket book read aloud to him by his sister, but the level of detail and cross-referencing required in this process was onerous and the attempt was abandoned after several hours. Maguire then enquired about obtaining a braille version of the ticket book. SOCOG indicated a braille version would be published but this did not occur. On 7 June 1999 Maguire was contacted by SOCOG to advise that the book would not be printed in braille as the cost was considered too high given the likely small number of braille-literate users.\nMaguire then lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, alleging direct discrimination against him personally, and indirect discrimination against those with vision impairment. The specific grounds for the complaint were: \nIn September 1999 this third ground for complaint was separated from the others and formed the basis for the standalone decision in \"Maguire v SOCOG 2000\".\nPrior to the matter being heard, SOCOG instituted a telephone helpline for ticketing enquiries by the visually impaired.\nArguments.\nJurisdiction of HREOC.\nSOCOG initially objected to the Commission hearing the complaint on jurisdictional grounds. SOCOG argued it was a government agency and not a trading corporation and therefore not captured by section 12 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Instead, SOCOG argued the complaint should be heard by State disability tribunals.\nOn 24 September 1999 SOCOG withdrew its objection to the complaint being heard but indicated it may renew it should the matter proceed to the Federal Court. Commissioner William Carter maintained the commission was competent to hear the complaint but was not required to formally rule on the objection as it was withdrawn prior to hearing.\nDirect discrimination.\nIn failing to provide the ticket book in braille, the Commissioner found that SOCOG breached section 24 of the Act. SOCOG argued that the delivery of the information in the ticket book did not constitute the provision of services within the meaning\nof section 24. The Commissioner did not accept that argument as the services provided by SOCOG fell inside the definition stated in section 4, in which SOCOG was providing tickets to sessions at the 2000 Olympics where SOCOG cannot refuse as the terms of conditions for the tickets was the same for Maguire as for any sighted person and that the ticketing process was integral to gaining a ticket to attend and to enjoy the entertainment provided by SOCOG. In providing the ticket book in print and not in braille meant that Maguire was denied access to the ticket book, the consequential services provided by SOCOG and accordingly, Maguire was denied the opportunity to make a valid application for tickets to the Olympic games.\nLess favourable treatment.\nThe commissioner felt that unless Maguire could have access to the information in order to make a valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person. SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet. The commissioner dismissed those arguments. Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and hours of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected in all respect the final decided choices of That person. The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the ticket book which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation. The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the ticket book was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline. The vital information in the ticket book was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad.\nUnjustifiable hardship.\nSOCOG argued that the provision of the ticket book in braille was an unjustifiable hardship under section 24 (2). Using Section 24 and section 11 of DDA 1992, the commissioner found that despite the small proportion of blind persons in the community who use Braille, SOCOG had the financial capacity to bear the additional cost as the cost of 200 braille copies of the ticket book would be $17,250.00 in comparison to the ticket book printing and distribution expenditure noted in SOCOG's budget which was $7.18 million.\nIndirect discrimination.\nThe commissioner found that SOCOG in not providing the ticket book in braille treated Maguire less favourably than persons without the disability which is also a breach of section 6.\nDecision.\nAfter finding in favour of Maguire, under section 103(1)(b)(ii) of the act, the commissioner made a declaration that SOCOG provide to Maguire forthwith the second booklet and that prior to\n8 October, that SOCOG consult and inform Maguire as best it can of the classes and sessions for which tickets remain available and assist him in making a valid application for the remaining tickets by 8 October 1999. Consequently, the commissioner made a further declaration that, if Maguire desire to engage in the final ticketing process and SOCOG is unable to\nprovide Maguire with the third booklet in Braille by 23 October, SOCOG again consult with Maguire and inform and assist him in the same manner as described in the second declaration above."

        "text": "Fred Jowett (1879 – 5 October 1939) was a Welsh rugby union player who represented Wales, and the British Lions. Jowett played club rugby for Swansea, and county rugby for Glamorgan. His first and only cap was on 10 January 1903 at St Helens Ground in Swansea against England. He made his début in an experienced team, with only George Travers of Pill Harriers earning his first cap alongside Jowett. The match was a one sided affair, with Wales winning 21–5, thanks to a hat-trick of tries from Jehoida Hodges. Although playing his part in an excellent victory over England, Jowett was never selected again.\nThe next year Jowett was selected to represent Bedell Sivright's British Lions on their tour of Australia and New Zealand, and was selected for one test.\nJowett was a high scoring wing, and his 1902/03 season tally of 42 tries for Swansea is still a club record to this day. In 1905 the draw of professionalism proved too strong, and Jowett headed north to play for Hull Kingston Rovers, severing his ties with rugby union forever.\nDuring World War I, Jowett was a corporal in the Welsh ammunition column.\nInternational matches played\n&lt;br&gt;\"Wales\"\n\"British Lions\""

His first Main Tour stints were rather unsuccessful, with the best result a last 48 appearance at the 2004 Grand Prix. Jin has regained a Main Tour place by winning the 2008 Asian Championship, beating Aditya Mehta 7–3 in the final, having had spells on the tour on three previous occasions.

        "text": "Li Hang (; born 4 October 1990) is a Chinese former professional snooker player who, in 2023, was permanently banned from the sport after committing a range of match-fixing offences. Li first competed professionally during the 2008–09 season. His best performances during his professional career were reaching two ranking semi-finals. He reached a career high of 28th in the snooker world rankings in 2019.\nIn December 2022, the WPBSA suspended Li from the professional tour amid a match-fixing investigation. In January 2023, it charged him with fixing a match, being concerned in fixing matches, approaching a player to fix a match, seeking to obstruct the investigation, and betting on snooker matches. Following an independent disciplinary tribunal, Li received a lifetime ban from the sport.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nLi was entered into the wildcard round of the China Open as an amateur player for three consecutive years from 2006. He lost at this stage in 2006 and 2008, but in 2007 he beat Ian Preece 5–4 to reach the first round of a ranking event for the first time, where he lost 1–5 to 1997 world champion Ken Doherty. In April 2008, Li won the ACBS Asian Under-21 Snooker Championship with a 6–1 success over Li Yuan in the final. The title earned him a place on the 2008–09 snooker tour.\nProfessional debut.\nHis first tournament as a professional was the 2008 Jiangsu Classic, where he finished last in his group, although he managed to beat the 2008 World Championship runner-up Ali Carter 2–0. In qualifying for the first ranking event of the year, the Northern Ireland Trophy, Li beat Robert Stephen 5–1 and David Morris 5–4 to reach the last qualifying round, where he was defeated 2–5 by Andrew Higginson. This was the closest he came to reaching the main stage of a tournament during the season, with it ending when Li lost 9–10 to Daniel Wells in the second round of World Championship qualifying. Li finished the year ranked world number 71.\n2009/2010 season.\nLi entered qualifying for five of the six ranking events during the 2009–10 season, losing in the first round in the UK Championship, China Open and World Championship.&lt;ref name=\"2009/10\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the Grand Prix he saw off Brendan O'Donoghue and David Roe both by last frame deciders, before losing 3–5 to Mark Davis. Li enjoyed his best run in qualifying for the Welsh Open, reaching the final round by eliminating Ian Preece, Jin Long and Mike Dunn, but was then beaten 4–5 by Fergal O'Brien. However, his performances were not enough for him to retain his place on tour as he finished the season ranked 81st in the world, outside of the top 64 who remained.\nWildcard years.\nCompeting as an amateur after losing his place on the main tour, Li could not enter qualifying for any ranking events. In the next three seasons he was placed into the wildcard round for five events in his homeland of China. The best run of his career to date came in the 2011 China Open by beating Ken Doherty 5–1 in the wildcard round and Graeme Dott 5–4 in the first round.&lt;ref name=\"2010/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By facing Shaun Murphy in the second round he played his third former world champion in succession and led 3–1 before being edged out 4–5. He also reached the first round the following year, but was whitewashed 0–5 by Mark Selby.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012 Li entered Qualifying School in an attempt to win back his place on the tour, but was unsuccessful on each occasion. In the 2012–13 season Li entered all three of the new minor-ranking Asian Players Tour Championship events. He lost in the first round of the opener and the second round of the next, but then produced a fantastic result at Event 3.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won three matches to reach the quarter-finals and then beat compatriot Zhang Anda 4–2 and established top 32 player Robert Milkins 4–1 in the semis. In his first final in a professional event Li faced Stuart Bingham and raced into a 3–1 lead with a high break of 83 before his opponent came back to win the last three frames to edge the match 4–3. The result saw him finish fourth on the Asian Order of Merit, inside the top eight who qualified for the 2013–14 snooker tour. It also gave him a place in the PTC Finals, but he lost 0–4 to Barry Hawkins in the first round.\nRejoining the tour.\nLi beat Mark Joyce in his opening match of the 2013–14 season to reach the first round of the Wuxi Classic where he made three breaks over 50 to establish a 3–0 lead over world number three Judd Trump and went on to seal a 5–2 win, the best of his career so far. He was edged out 5–4 by compatriot Xiao Guodong in the following round. At the UK Championship, Li beat David Gilbert and Andrew Higginson both by 6–4 scorelines to face world number one Neil Robertson in the last 32.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Li gave the Australian a competitive game but lost 6–3, with Robertson stating afterwards that Li was much better than his ranking suggested and that his safety play had particularly impressed him. Li also qualified for the German Masters and China Open but lost 5–3 to ranking event winners Barry Hawkins and Marco Fu. Li whitewashed former world champion Peter Ebdon at the Welsh Open, before being beaten 4–1 by Anthony Hamilton in the last 64. Li was ranked world number 85 at the end of the season.\n2014/2015 season.\nLi won four matches at the Yixing Open, before losing 4–3 to Michael Holt in the quarter-finals. He defeated Nigel Bond, David Morris and Mark Joyce all by 5–2 scorelines to qualify for the Shanghai Masters, where he was beaten 5–3 by Stuart Bingham in the first round.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Championship, Li thrashed four-time world champion John Higgins 6–1 and Zhao Xintong also 6–1 to reach the last 16. A third 6–1 result followed, however it was Li's opponent Ronnie O'Sullivan who recorded it to end his tournament. Compatriot Liang Wenbo eliminated Li 5–1 in the first round of the German Masters. His second last 16 match in a ranking event came at the Indian Open thanks to wins over Allan Taylor and Stuart Carrington, but he lost 4–2 to Michael White. Following 10–1 and 10–7 victories over Chris Melling and Gary Wilson he stood one win away from qualifying for the World Championship for the first time. Li held 3–0 and 8–5 leads over Carrington but would ultimately lose 10–9. He ended a season inside the top 64 in the rankings for the first time as he was 55th.\n2015/2016 season.\nLi lost in the qualifying rounds for the first three ranking events of the 2015–16 season. A pair of 6–5 victories over Lee Walker and Ricky Walden saw him advance to the third round of the UK Championship, where he lost 6–3 to Jamie Burnett. Li was knocked out in the second round of the Welsh Open by Joe Perry and the only other ranking event he qualified for was the China Open, but he was beaten 5–3 by Walker in the first round."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Australia between 13 November 2008 and 15 February 2009. The tour was divided into two legs; commencing with a tour match against New South Wales, the first leg contained two Test matches between New Zealand and Australia in which the sides competed for the Trans-Tasman Trophy.\nNew Zealand then went home for a series against the West Indies and Australia hosted the South African team. New Zealand returned to Australia on 29 January 2009 for the second leg, comprising a tour match against the Prime Minister's XI, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) against Australia for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy and a Twenty20 International also against Australia.\nBackground.\nThe Australian side had recently returned from a tour of India where they had lost the four-match Test series, and with it the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2-0. During that series, Australia had repeatedly fallen behind the required over rate; during the final match, captain Ricky Ponting used part-time bowlers to try to catch up rather than push for a victory, a move which was criticised by former captains.\nPrior to this series, the New Zealand side had just completed a tour of Bangladesh, winning the test series 1-0 (with one test drawn after three days were lost to rain) and the one-day series 2-1. At the beginning of the test series, they were ranked seventh in the ICC Test Championship. Captain Daniel Vettori said that he \"was leading the nucleus of a good side\", but pointed out that the inexperienced batting lineup would face a tough task against an Australian side that would be looking to come back strongly from their series loss to India.\nTrans–Tasman Trophy.\n1st Test.\nBrisbane had been hit hard with weeks worth of devastating storms, leaving the pitch soft and green. Both teams were returning from the sub-continent and struggled badly with the bat. Australia were all out for just 214 late on day one with Clarke last to go on 98 runs, NZ survived a few overs to finish 0/7 at stumps. The next morning began perfectly for Australia with a wicket on the first ball, and more kept coming. NZ collapsing to be all out for just 156 from 50 overs, Taylor the highest scorer on 40. Australia did not fare much better with Hayden out first ball and Australia limping to 6/131 at stumps on day 2. Katich managed to score 100 and he ended running out of partners finishing not out on 131, seeing Australia to 268. Needing 327 runs to win, NZ got a terrible start and were 4-49 until a good partnership between Flynn and Taylor. However Australia managed two late wickets, one on the last ball of the day putting NZ at 6/143 at stumps on Day 3. Australia bowled NZ out for 177 on Day 4 to give them the 1-0 advantage.\n2nd Test.\nFollowing the first Test, the Australians called Peter Siddle into the squad with Shane Watson returning to state cricket. Jason Krejza was named in the team after having been twelfth man in the first Test; however, he twisted his ankle in training two days prior to the start of the match and his place was taken by fellow spin bowler Nathan Hauritz.\nOn the Tuesday before the match began, New Zealand Cricket announced the appointment of Andy Moles as successor of retiring coach John Bracewell. Moles was to take over immediately following the Australian Test series, meaning this was Bracewell's final match in charge of the New Zealand side. The only change to the New Zealand team was Peter Fulton replacing Grant Elliott in an attempt to bolster the batting lineup.\nODI Series.\n1st ODI.\nAustralia's top order capitulated with none of the top five scoring over 15 runs. There was some resistance from Hussey and Haddin, but ultimately Australia were unable to bat out the innings, running out of wickets and posting a very low score. Australia did however put the pressure on with the ball and for most of the chase New Zealand was behind Australia score at the same points in time. Michael Clarke clean-bowled a batsman but replays showed that the bails were dislodged by Haddin's gloves, which were in front of the stumps. The loss was Australia's fourth consecutive ODI loss, having just been defeated 1–4 against South Africa.\n3rd ODI.\nAustralia could have scored 303, but 2 penalty runs were not awarded because the Australian batsmen ran down the pitch (as opposed to beside the pitch, which is the rule) again after being warned not to by the umpire. The rule no runs are obtained from a delivery (ball) if a batsman runs down the pitch.\n5th ODI.\nRain caused the match to be reduced to 22 overs. The New Zealand innings was further reduced to 20 overs. Heavy rain caused the match to be abandoned when New Zealand were 123."

Previously, Kim was a shortstop for the Lotte Giants, SK Wyverns and Hanwha Eagles. He batted and threw right-handed.\nProfessional career.\nKim graduated from Busan Technical High School in 1991. He was then signed by the Lotte Giants, and played for the Giants for eleven seasons. In 2002, Kim moved to the SK Wyverns. After the 2005 season his contract with the Wyverns ran out and he became a free agent. Before the 2006 season Kim signed with the Hanwha Eagles for four-year.\nSince Kim was considered one of the best defensive infielders in the KBO league, he had been regularly picked for the South Korea national baseball team as a utility infielder.\nIn October 2002, Kim got first called up to the national squad, and competed in the Asian Games. He helped his team defend the gold medal, going 4-for-8 with 3 RBIs. A month later, Kim was joined in the South Korea national team again for the 2002 Intercontinental Cup held in Havana, Cuba.\nIn 2006, he was selected for the South Korea national baseball team, and participated in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Kim went 3-for-5 with an RBI over Team USA in Round 2. He hit a one-bounce ground rule double over the left field off setup man Dan Wheeler with two outs in the fourth inning, and smacked an RBI single off Mike Timlin in the sixth. At the last match of Round 2 against Team Japan, Kim drew a one-out walk in the eighth off Toshiya Sugiuchi and scored the tiebreaking run when Lee Jong-beom hit a two-RBI double.\nIn December 2007, Kim played for South Korea again at the Asian Baseball Championship held in Taichung, Taiwan. He went 3-for-3 with 3 RBIs, playing shortstop and second base during the competition.\nOn July 16, 2008, Kim was named to the South Korea national baseball team for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Due to right ankle injury, he was mainly used as a substitute infielder or first base coach during the Olympics. But in the team's seventh game in the round-robin, against the Netherlands, Kim drew a two-out walk in the fifth off Alexander Smit and scored a run when Kim Hyun-soo hit a two-RBI single.\nKim retired for good as a player after the 2009 season but retained his assistant coaching position in the Eagles."

The school's team currently competes in the Pac-12 Conference.\nThe Arizona State Sun Devils have appeared in the NCAA tournament 17 times, including 3 Elite Eights (1961, 1963, 1975). They have won eight conference championships (four WAC, and four Border Conference) and finished in the final AP rankings seven times. The highest national ranking the Sun Devils have achieved is AP No. 3 under Bobby Hurley during the 2017–18 season and No. 3 under Ned Wulk during the 1980–81 season when the starting lineup included future NBA stars Byron Scott, Fat Lever, and Alton Lister.\n38 ASU Sun Devils have been selected in the NBA draft, including ten-time NBA All-Star James Harden, Byron Scott, Isaac Austin, Lafayette Lever, Alton Lister, Lionel Hollins, Sam Williams, Jeff Pendergraph, Mario Bennett, Tommy Smith, Ike Diogu, Eddie House, Freddie Lewis, and Joe Caldwell.\nHistory.\nBobby Hurley era.\nArizona State is currently led by head coach Bobby Hurley (eight seasons), who replaced Herb Sendek. Sendek was credited for bringing a \"basketball atmosphere\" and level of excitement to Arizona State that had been absent for years. In his first four seasons at Arizona State, Sendek led the Sun Devils to three consecutive 20 win seasons, the 2009 Pac-10 conference tournament finals, and the second round of the 2009 NCAA tournament and 2014 NCAA tournament. Hurley, in turn, has taken the Sun Devils to the 2018, 2019, and 2023 NCAA Tournaments. \nThe Sun Devils earned a 3-seed and first-round bye in the Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament and were scheduled to play Washington State when the tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was also canceled due to the pandemic. While the NCAA did not release seedings for the canceled tournament, the Sun Devils were projected by ESPN's Joe Lunardi in his end-of-season \"Bracketology\" to be a 9-seed. This would have been the first time since 1964 that the Sun Devils had made the tournament in three straight years.\nRecord vs. Pac-12 opponents.\nArizona State has the following all-time series records vs. Pac-12 opponents. The Sun Devils lead three series with conference opponents. (Note: the listed all-time series records include any non-conference matchups). Updated through Feb. 20, 2024.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Sun Devils have appeared in the NCAA tournament 16* (15) times. Their combined record is 14–17 (12-16). ASU's 1995 NCAA tournament appearance (2 wins, 1 loss) was vacated by the NCAA.\nNIT results.\nThe Sun Devils have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 7–13.\nNAIA tournament results.\nArizona State appeared in the NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament twice. Their combined record is 2–2.\nCommissioners' Invitational results.\nArizona State appeared in the National Commissioners Invitational Tournament once. Their overall record is 0–1.\nRetired/honored jerseys.\nThe Sun Devils have retired/honored eight jerseys in program history, most recently Ike Diogu's 5 in 2022.

        "text": "The 1990 Major League Baseball lockout was the seventh work stoppage in baseball and, at the time, the second-longest since 1972. Beginning in February, the lockout lasted 32 days, virtually wiping out spring training, moving Opening Day back a week to April 9 and extending the season three days to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule. \nBackground.\nThe five-year Basic Agreement between the players and owners was set to expire on December 31, 1989. During the buildup to the lockout, the two sides spent months trying to iron out long-standing disagreements over free agency and arbitration; following arbitrator determinations that the owners had colluded in suppressing player wages in the mid-1980s, with a more open labor market player remuneration had rapidly increased. By the end of the 1989 season, salaries for nine top players had reached the $3 million-a-year level. In 1988, national television broadcasting contracts had been negotiated which brought revenue to $1.5 billion over four years, amounting to a 102 percent increase on the previous contract. Given the significant increase in funds available and the earlier disagreements over free agency there was a likelihood of a dispute.\nOwners' plan.\nThe owners set forth a revenue sharing plan in which 48% of gate receipts and all revenue from local and network broadcasting would go toward paying player salaries. These salaries would be based on a pay-for-performance scale, in which players with less than six years of experience would be compensated based on a ranking against their peers. Perhaps most importantly, a salary cap would be placed on each club. In the process, there would be a stipulation put in place that teams reaching the said cap could make no more free agent signings or salary increases.\nOwners claimed that under the plan, average player salaries would proceed to rise over 20% to $770,000 by the 1993 season. They cited rising attendance figures as well as solid television contracts with CBS and ESPN.\nMLBPA's response.\nAlthough revenue sharing of this type had worked considerably well in the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) Executive Director Donald Fehr, feared that a salary cap would restrict the number of choices free agents could make. He argued that a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multi-year contracts. Players were concerned that the owners were trying to limit free agency and had been engaged in long term preparations for a dispute.\nResolution.\nCommissioner Fay Vincent worked with both sides and, on March 19, a new Basic Agreement was reached. The minimum major league salary was raised from $68,000 to $100,000. Meanwhile, a six-man study committee on revenue sharing was established."

Overall, Ellis went 1–1 with a 3.24 ERA in eight games (one started) in his first big league season.\nOn April 23, 1968, Ellis was traded with Ted Savage to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jim Hickman and Phil Regan. On October 21 of that year, he was traded to the Cardinals for Pete Mikkelsen. He appeared in two games for the Cardinals in 1969, starting one of them. In 5 innings, he allowed only one run for a 1.69 ERA.\nEllis played his final big league game on July 12, 1969. Overall, he went 1–1 with a 2.86 ERA in 10 major league games.\nHe was involved in a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers on October 20, 1970. The Cardinals sent Ellis and Carl Taylor to the Brewers for Jerry McNertney, George Lauzerique and Jesse Huggins, a minor leaguer. After one season with the Brewers' top farm club, the Evansville Triplets, Ellis' professional career ended."

Several OUABC boxers were featured in a 2006 documentary titled \"Blue Blood\".\nThe club competes against Cambridge University Amateur Boxing Club in The Varsity Match, also known as The True Love Bowl, each year. Typically, the match location switches between Oxford and Cambridge, though some matches have been held in London.\nIn 2003/2004, OUABC began including female boxers in training and matches. In the 2005 Varsity Match, Kaleen Love of Oxford was the first Oxford woman to compete in a Varsity boxing match, and defeated Catherine Tubb of Cambridge Both were awarded Extraordinary Full Blues for their athletic accomplishments.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, under the tutelage of head coach Henry Dean, OUABC won 17 Varsity Matches in a row, the longest single stretch of victories in the history of the tournament. However, since then the Match results have been more balanced; and in both the 2005 and 2009 Varsity Matches, OUABC registered defeats by the maximum 9-0 margin. Cambridge University Amateur Boxing Club (CUABC) remains the only side to have achieved this feat since the number of bouts was increased to 9 in the 1950s. For a time, Cambridge had taken to hosting the match every second year in London, due to seating limitations at Cambridge venues, with the 2009 match recorded for a documentary aired on Channel 4."

He was also the player-manager of the Birmingham Grays in 1892, the owner, manager and second baseman of the Savannah, Georgia baseball club in 1893, and the owner and president of the Kansas City Blue Stockings club in the Western League from 1902 to 1903.\nEarly years.\nManning was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1862. His parents, Thomas and Catherine Manning, were immigrants from Ireland. His father worked as a common laborer. Manning had three younger sisters, Julia, Elizabeth and Mary.\nProfessional baseball player.\nBoston.\nManning made his debut in professional baseball playing for the Springfield, Massachusetts, club in 1883. He made his major league debut for the Boston Beaneaters in May 1884. At age 22, he appeared in 89 games for the Beaneaters, 73 as an outfielder, nine each at second base and shortstop, and three at third base. He compiled a .241 batting average in 345 at bats, and totaled 52 runs, 83 hits and 35 RBIs in 89 games. In 1885, Manning appeared in 84 games for Boston, 83 of them as an outfielder. His batting average dropped to .206 in 306 at bats.\nDetroit.\nIn September 1885, the Detroit Wolverines purchased Manning from the Beaneaters for $500. Manning appeared in 20 games, all at shortstop, for the 1885 Wolverines. The following year, he served as a backup outfielder for the 1886 Wolverines, appearing in 25 games at the position. After batting .269 in 1885 for Detroit, his batting average dropped 83 points to .186 in 1886.\nManning began the 1887 season in Detroit, but the team was loaded with talent, and Manning faced the prospect of again being a backup player. \"The Sporting Life\" opined in February 1887, \"Jimmy Manning ought not be a substitute in any nine. He is too good a ball player to be idle most of the time.\" In May 1887, the Wolverines sent their \"extra men\" (Manning and Knowlton) to the Kansas City Cowboys in order to relieve the club of salary obligations for players it did not need. Manning played in Kansas City for the next two months of the 1887 season, but Detroit reclaimed Manning in July, after an injury to second baseman Fred Dunlap. Manning appeared in only 13 games for the 1887 Wolverines, 10 in the outfield and three at shortstop, compiling a .192 batting average. In late July 1887, \"The Sporting News\" reported that Manning was \"troubled with malaria\" that he had contracted in Kansas City.\nKansas City, Part I.\nManning spent all or parts of six seasons with the Kansas City Cowboys from 1887 to 1892. He was acquired from Detroit in the middle of May 1887, and by the middle of July, Manning was referred to in \"The Sporting Life\" as \"the best and most popular player that ever wore a Kansas City uniform.\" He was reclaimed by Detroit for 13 games in July, but then returned to Kansas City in the middle of August. Manning compiled a career high .433 batting average in 381 at bats for the 1887 Cowboys. He played at shortstop for the Cowboys in 1887 and performed well defensively, the Kansas City correspondent to \"The Sporting Life\" calling him \"the greatest of shortstops at short field.\"\nIn 1888, Kansas City had two rival baseball teams, both called the Cowboys, with one playing in the American Association, and the other playing in the Western Association. Manning was player-manager of the Cowboys in the Western Association during the 1888 season. He hit .289 and stole 101 bases in 116 games.\nDuring the 1889 season, Manning joined the Cowboys of the American Association, considered a major league. Manning appeared in 132 games, 69 in the outfield and 63 at second base, and compiled a .204 batting average in 506 at bats. According to baseball historian David Nemec, Manning's .204 batting average was the lowest recorded up to that time by a major league player with at least 500 at bats in a season. Germany Schaefer broke Manning's record in 1891 with a .201 average in 512 at bats. In fact, Manning was not the offensive liability that his batting average might suggest; he drew 54 bases on balls and was hit by pitch 13 times to boost his on-base percentage to .297, and he also stole 58 bases during the 1889 season.\nDuring the winter of 1888–89, Manning traveled to Hawaii, Australia, Ceylon, Arabia, Egypt, Europe, and the British Isles as part of Albert Spalding's \"Around the World Baseball Tour\". Baseball games were held between the Chicago White Stockings and a picked team called the \"All-Americans\"; Manning played for the \"All-Americans\".\nIn 1890, the Cowboys left the American Association and rejoined the Western Association. In July 1890, Manning took over as the manager of the Cowboys, returning to the player-manager role he had filled in 1888. Manning had the best base-stealing record in organized baseball during the 1890 season, stealing 96 bases in only 111 games.\nIn 1891, Manning managed the club, played second base, and hit .299 with 10 triples and 58 stolen bases in 116 games.\nIn February 1892, Manning signed with Kansas City to again manage the team and play second base. The Kansas City correspondent to \"The Sporting Life\" wrote at the time: \"The news that Manning is to be with us again was hailed with satisfaction by his great army of friends, who have learned to admire him as a player and a gentleman during his many years' service in Kansas City. It may be put down as certain that no club in the Western League will have a better manager or as good a second baseman as Jimmy Manning.\" During the first half of the 1892 season, Manning hit .303 with 30 stolen bases in 62 games.\nBaseball manager and owner.\nBirmingham.\nIn late July 1892, Manning left Kansas City to become player-manager for the Birmingham Grays of the Southern League. He compiled a .268 batting average in 38 games for Birmingham, and assembled a team that was in competition for the Southern League pennant.\nSavannah.\nIn 1893, Manning was a player-manager and owner of the Savannah, Georgia club in the 12-team Southern Base Ball League. He played second base for the team and compiled a .290 batting average in 89 games. However, the team and the league disbanded in mid-August 1893. Despite the league's failure, the Savannah club made money and paid its bills on time, and Manning left in late August with a profit estimated at $4,000. The Savannah correspondent to \"The Sporting Life\" wrote that Manning left the city \"with the well-wishes of everybody in Savannah\" in appreciation for the way he conducted the club: \"There was no kicking, no fighting or no tough ball playing allowed, and it was a pleasure to see the game played. . . . If ever a man deserved to make money he did. He came here a stranger to every one in the city, but by his gentlemanly conduct and courteous treatment of every one he came in contact with, he soon made a host of friends.\"\nKansas City, Part II.\nIn the fall of 1893, Manning was one of the three principal organizers, along with Charlie Cushman and John S. Barnes, of the new Western League (a league that was later renamed the American League in 1900). In September 1893, he visited Kansas City to lay the groundwork for establishing a new baseball club there, including securing an option for the Exposition baseball grounds. \"The Kansas City Journal\" at the time called Manning \"the most popular ball player who ever wore a Kansas City uniform.\" Manning told the press in Kansas City, \"I spent six years here. Kansas City is like home to me ... If I put a new team here next year, as I hope to, it will be a winner, for that is what this town wants and what it demands.\"\nIn November 1893, the league was formally established with Manning as the owner of the Kansas City club. Manning expressed enthusiasm at the new league's prospects and said that the organizational meeting in Indianapolis had been \"a complete and unqualified success.\" Manning also stated that he would staff the new Kansas City Cowboys teams largely with the players who he had managed in Savannah in 1892.\nIn 1894, served as the Kansas City team's owner and manager, and also played second base, compiling a .326 batting average with 43 extra base hits and 41 stolen bases.\nDuring the 1895 season, Manning and his wife lived at the Centropolis Hotel in Kansas City, as Manning continued as owner and manager of the Kansas City Cowboys. He also appeared in 121 games as the team's second baseman and compiled a .359 batting average with 44 extra base hits and 39 stolen bases in 1895. Manning's team finished in second place in Western League in 1895. He reported that his team made profits of $18,000 in 1894 and $12,000 in 1895, the decline in 1895 resulting from \"five wet Sundays and a bad fourth of July\", with Sunday and holiday games generating profits of $1,000 on average.\nIn December 1895, Manning and Frank Selee organized a tour of baseball players to Australia for the winter of 1896–1897.\nManning continued to serve as team owner, manager and second baseman in 1896. Although he did not continue as a player after the 1897 season, he continued as the owner and manager of the Kansas City club through the 1900 season.\nDuring Manning's seven years as manager and owner of the Kansas City Blues, the team's record was as follows:\nWashington.\nManning was also one of the organizers of the American League as a competing major league. The organizational meeting was held at Chicago in late November 1900, with Manning attending as the representative of the proposed club in Washington, D.C., along with Charles Comiskey of Chicago, John McGraw of Baltimore, James D. Burns of Detroit and Henry Killilea of Milwaukee. At the meeting, it was decided that the new league would not have a team in Kansas City, and Manning was assigned responsibility for the proposed new club in Washington, D.C. Afterward, Manning stated: \"I am reconciled to the idea of moving into Washington. I will take my team there bodily, will add a couple of National Leaguers and will show them that American League ball is a long way faster than they imagine.\"\nIn late 1900, Manning became president of the new American League club proposed for Washington, D.C. In December 1900, he secured a 10-year option on two ballparks in Washington and planned his move from Kansas City to Washington. In March 1901, the new team, named the Washington Senators, was incorporated by Manning, Fred Postal, Bob Needham, John J. Hogan and William F. Hart.\nIn 1901, Manning served as the first manager of the Senators, leading team to a 61–73 record. In November 1901, Manning sold his interest in the Senators to Fred Postal and also resigned as the team's manager. Later reports attributed Manning's departure to differences with co-owner Postal, who was not satisfied with Manning's business management, though Manning's defenders noted that Manning had \"never posed as an expert book keeper, and was not originally engaged for business roles, and that point would have no bearing upon his re-engagement as team manager.\"\nKansas City, Part III.\nIn January 1902, after selling his interest in the Senators, Manning and Kid Nichols became partners and co-owners in the new Kansas City Blue Stockings baseball club in the Western League. He also worked as the western agent for a new explosive. Through the 1902 and 1903 seasons, Manning served as the club's president and Nichols the manager. Manning's club faced stiff competition from the Kansas City Blues baseball club in the American Association during the 1902 and 1903 season and folded after the 1903 season due to territorial rights.\nFamily and later years.\nThrough his baseball career, Manning had returned home to Fall River, Massachusetts, where he worked as a druggist in a store operated by Will Smith. Smith died suddenly in September 1894, and \"The Sporting News\" wrote at the time: \"For years Manager Manning has had that blessing that comes to so few -- a true friend. This friend, Mr. Will Smith, of Fall River, Mass., has been the sharer of all his hopes, his joy and his reverses. It was with him Manning made his first start in life, and every fall since he has been a devotee of the diamond he has returned home to again take up his work with Mr. Smith.\"\nAfter retiring from baseball, Manning was employed in the powder business in 1906. The following year, he was reported to be \"prospering in business in Kansas City.\"\nIn 1929, Manning died at age 67 in either Mercedes, Texas, or Edinburg, Texas. He was buried at the North Burial Ground in Fall River, Massachusetts."

        "text": "Brett Franklin Anderson (born February 1, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2009 to 2021 for the Oakland Athletics, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Toronto Blue Jays, and Milwaukee Brewers.\nEarly life.\nAnderson attended Stillwater High School in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where he was an all-state selection in 2006, his senior year. He had a 9–0 win–loss record that season with a 0.37 earned run average ERA, 102 strikeouts and only nine walks in innings pitched. He played in the Connie Mack World Series with his amateur team after both his junior and senior seasons and in the 2005 AFLAC High School All-American Game, where he was the winning pitcher. He also played for the US National 18-and-under team alongside Clayton Kershaw and Shawn Tolleson.\nAnderson's career numbers at Stillwater were 22–8 with eight saves, 276 strikeouts and an 0.90 ERA. He signed a letter of intent to play for Oklahoma State University where his father, Frank Anderson, was the head coach.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\n\"Baseball America\" rated Anderson as having the best command of any high school prospect heading into the 2006 Major League Baseball draft. and was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the second round. He was torn between signing and playing for his dad at Oklahoma State. He said that playing at OSU \"would be awesome. It'd be fun to play with my buddies. I'm torn.\" He also said that part of him wanted to prove that he should have been a first round pick. Nevertheless, he agreed to a contract with the Diamondbacks that included a signing bonus of $950,000 with an additional $80,000 to continue his education if he wanted to. The contract was finalized on September 1, 2006.\nAnderson made his professional debut on April 5, 2007, as the starting pitcher for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the Midwest League, in a game against the Great Lakes Loons, whose starting pitcher was former and future teammate Clayton Kershaw. He was 8–4 with a 2.21 ERA in 14 starts for the Silver Hawks and was selected to the Midwest League mid-season All-Star team. On June 21, 2007, Anderson was promoted by the Diamondbacks organization to the Visalia Oaks in the Advanced-Class A California League. On August 8, Anderson and several other Visalia players were involved in a car accident while en route to an amusement park, forcing the postponement of that night's game. Anderson sustained only a mild concussion but one of his teammates fractured his skull. He pitched in nine games for the Oaks with a 3–3 record and 4.85 ERA while missing some time due to some elbow tenderness.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn December 14, 2007, he was traded by the Diamondbacks with Dana Eveland, Greg Smith, Aaron Cunningham, Carlos González and Chris Carter to the Oakland Athletics for Dan Haren and Connor Robertson.\nIn 2008, Anderson was a combined 11–5 with a 3.69 ERA and 118 strikeouts in 20 games (19 starts) between the Stockton Ports in the California League and the Double-A Midland RockHounds of the Texas League. In his debut for Midland, he struck out 12 batters and gave up two runs in six innings for the win. He was selected to pitch in the All-Star Futures Game played at Yankee Stadium during the All-Star break and was named to the U.S. Olympic Team in Beijing. He pitched seven innings to collect the win in the bronze medal game against Japan.\nAnderson was a highly touted young prospect; in 2008 he was ranked as the 36th-best prospect in the Major Leagues, and in 2009 he was ranked the top prospect in Oakland's system and the #7 prospect overall by \"Baseball America\".\nAnderson was promoted to the Athletics as part of their opening day roster for 2009 and made his Major League debut on April 10, 2009 against the Seattle Mariners, allowing five runs in six innings to take the loss. He picked up his first career MLB win when he allowed only two earned runs in six innings against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 20. On July 6, he pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox striking out 9 batters, a career high. It was his first career shutout, and his first career complete game.\nOn September 24, 2009, Anderson broke the Oakland Athletics single-season rookie strikeout record (previously set by Rick Langford in 1977), while racking up 6 strikeouts in 5 innings versus the Texas Rangers. He finished the 2009 season with an 11–11 record, posting a 4.06 ERA. He led the team in wins (11) and shutouts (1) and tied with Brett Tomko in strikeouts (150).\nThe Athletics signed Anderson to a four-year, $12.5 million, contract extension at the start of the 2010 season, which he began by throwing six shutout innings against the Mariners. He allowed 3 hits, struck out 4 and walked 1, getting the win. In 19 starts in 2010 he went 7-6 with a 2.80 ERA. In 2011, after a June 5 outing, he was placed on the disabled list, eventually undergoing Tommy John surgery which required 13 months of rehabilitation. In 13 starts before the injury he was 3-6 with a 4.00 ERA.\nAnderson returned on August 21, 2012 for the Athletics, allowing one run in seven innings for a win against the Minnesota Twins. However, he suffered an oblique strain during a start against the Detroit Tigers toward the 4th inning and was later pulled out, taking the loss. He spent the remainder of the 2012 season on the disabled list with the injury, and had a 4-2 record in six starts that season. Despite his limited action during the regular season, the Athletics put him on the playoff roster for the 2012 American League Division Series against the Detroit Tigers. Anderson pitched six scoreless innings in a 2–0 victory in game three to keep the Athletics alive, though they eventually lost the series in five games.\nOn February 28, 2013, Anderson was named Opening Day starter for the A's for the 2013 season. He went up against Mariners ace Félix Hernández and came away with the loss. He left his start on April 19 with what was called a sprained ankle but was later determined to be a stress fracture in his right foot. He originally hoped to return to the rotation in July, but the injury was more serious than previously thought and he was placed on the 60-day disabled list. He was eventually activated from the disabled list on August 28, at which the Athletics chose to use him out of the bullpen through the rest of the season. He appeared in 16 games that season, only five of which were starts and was 1-4 with a 6.04 ERA. He also appeared in relief in game four of the 2013 American League Division Series against the Tigers, allowing the two winning runs to score on a walk, wild pitch and double.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn December 10, 2013, Anderson was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Drew Pomeranz and minor league pitcher Chris Jensen. In just his third start of the season, on April 12, 2014, Anderson broke his index finger while batting, sending him again to the disabled list. He rejoined the Rockies rotation in July and he pitched well for them for the next month. However, on August 5, he had to leave his start early due to back spasms He wound up undergoing season-ending back surgery to repair a herniated disc in his lower back. He made only eight starts for the Rockies in that injury riddled season, with a 1–3 record and a 2.91 ERA. After the season, the Rockies declined Anderson's $12 million option for 2015, making him a free agent.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn December 31, 2014, Anderson was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers to a one-year, $10 million, contract. In 2015 he started a career-high 31 games and pitched a career-high 180 innings. He was 10–9 with a 3.69 ERA. He had the highest ground ball percentage among major league pitchers (66.3%), and the lowest line drive percentage (15.2%) and fly ball percentage (18.5%). He earned an extra $2.4 million in bonuses by reaching that innings mark.\nAfter the season, Anderson accepted the Dodgers $15.8 million qualifying offer to remain with the club for the 2016 season. On March 3, 2016, it was announced Anderson required back surgery to repair a bulging disc in his back, and would miss 3–5 months. It was in the same area he had been injured in 2014. He finally rejoined the Dodgers on August 14 after a few minor league rehab starts. In his first start of the season, he allowed two home runs and five runs in the first inning and was replaced by a relief pitcher. He made three starts and one relief appearance for the Dodgers in September and was 1–2 with an 11.91 ERA for the season, allowing 15 earned runs in 11 innings.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn January 26, 2017, Anderson signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs for $3.5 million, with incentives for the number of games started which could raise the total value of the contract to $10 million. Anderson was designated for assignment on July 26, 2017, and was released on August 1, 2017.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn August 15, 2017, Anderson signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. On August 29, the Blue Jays selected Anderson's contract where he made his Blue Jays debut against the Boston Red Sox that same day.\nReturn to Oakland.\nOn March 20, 2018, Anderson signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. He was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds to begin the season. His contract was selected by Oakland on May 2 to make a start against the Seattle Mariners that night. After starting 4 games for the A's, Anderson was placed on the disabled list. He was activated off the disabled list on July 8. Anderson started 17 games on the season for the A's, finishing with a record of 4-5 in innings.\nOn February 13, 2019, Anderson re-signed with the Athletics, inking a one-year deal worth $1.5 million plus incentives. In 2019 he had the lowest strikeouts/9 innings ratio in the major leagues (4.60), and the lowest strikeout percentage in the major leagues (12.1%).\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 13, 2019, Anderson signed a one-year, $5 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2020, Anderson pitched to a 4-4 record over 10 appearances, with a 4.21 ERA and 32 strikeouts in 47.0 innings of work. \nOn February 16, 2021, Anderson agreed to re-sign with the Brewers on a one-year, $2.5MM contract, pending a physical. On February 22, the deal became official. In 24 starts for Milwaukee in 2021, he posted a 4–9 record and 4.22 ERA with 58 strikeouts in 96.0 innings of work. He became a free agent following the season.\nOn December 16, 2022, Anderson announced he wanted to return to MLB, and was participating in offseason training with Clayton Kershaw to stay in shape.\nScouting report.\nAnderson throws four pitches for strikes: a fastball, a curve, a changeup and a slider. His fastball sits in the 89-92 mph range and he offers a two-seam variety in addition to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he can paint on the corner versus right-handed batters and sweep away from lefties in the 79-81 mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84 mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding in his ability to command his entire arsenal.\nAnderson is considered an \"extreme ground ball pitcher\" with a ground ball rate of 58.2% -- second highest of all starting pitchers, since his career began in 2009."

        "title": "Asian Games Federation",
        "text": "The Asian Games Federation (AGF) was the governing body of sports in Asia from 1949 to 1982. The federation was disbanded on 16 November 1982 in New Delhi and succeeded by the Olympic Council of Asia. The AGF was responsible for the organisation of the Asian Games from 1951 to 1982. The Federation was established on 13 February 1949, in a meeting held in Patiala House in New Delhi.\nEstablishment.\nIn March 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, who later became the first prime minister of India, held the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi—a meeting with a prospect to bring the possibility of Asian Games under the attention of participating countries. Before the conference, Guru Dutt Sondhi, who was the member of the International Olympic Committee for India, encouraged Yadavindra Singh, Maharaja of Patiala and the then-president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), to communicate with meeting attendees to establish the Asian Games Federation. The proposal was not acknowledged by some representatives and the rest, who approved, refused to make any commitment.\nIn July 1947, the IOA, which initially was advocating the organisation of Games, retracted its patronage for unknown reasons. Sondhi found an alternative; rather than organising a multi-sport event, for which he needed an approval of the IOA, he opted for a single event championship titled the Asian Athletic Championships—a track and field event. Sondhi, who was also the president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI) (now Athletics Federation of India), received the consent of federation in February 1948. Yadavindra, on the request of Sondhi, became the president of the organising committee for the Championship, and Sondhi took the position of chairman. In early July, formal invitations were sent to various Asian countries, backed by the letter from the AAFI. But the response was not positive as there was a scheduling conflict with the 1948 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled from 29 July.\nMeeting in London.\nDuring the 1948 Olympic Games, Sondhi held a meeting on 8 August 1948, at Mount Royal Hotel in London. Invitations were sent to all the Asian National Olympic Committees present in London at that time. Chief Managers of Korea, China, Philippines, Singapore, Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria were called for the meeting, but only representatives from Burma, Ceylon, China, India, Philippines, and Korea attended. Sondhi made two proposals: first, to organise an Asian Athletic Championship in February 1949 in New Delhi, and second, to establish the Asian Games Federation, based on the IOC model. Founder of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation and first Filipino member of the International Olympic Committee Jorge B. Vargas stoutly backed the second proposal, and the first proposal was accepted by the attendees with an amendment. For the further development of the federation, a decision was made to conduct a meeting during the Championship in New Delhi in February 1949, and a sub-committee, consisting representatives from four nations, was appointed to draft the constitution and ordinances of the federation.\nMeeting in Delhi.\nThe Asian Athletics Championship was not realised due to \"unsettled conditions\" and economic difficulties of participating nations, but a meeting was organised at the Patiala House, in Delhi, among the representatives of nine Asian nations, on 12 and 13 February 1949. The meeting was attended by the representatives of Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand. The drafted constitution, presented by the sub-committee, was again revised as per the Olympic Charter—the constitution of the International Olympic Committee—and accredited. To avoid the ambiguity generated by the literal meaning of term \"athletic\", sub-committee rectified the primitively proposed title of the federation from Asian Amateur Athletic Federation to Asian Games Federation. Afghanistan, Burma, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines became the first five members of the Asian Games Federation after signing the constitution in its full term; the other four attendees also signed it, but it still needed the ratification by their governments or their National Sports Associations. The federation elected Yadavindra Singh as the president, Jorge B. Vargas as vice-president, and G. D. Sondhi as secretary treasurer."

        "text": "The 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's scratch was the women's scratch race at 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. It was one of the eight women's events, held at the Manchester Velodrome in Manchester, Great Britain on the fifth and final day of the Championships on 30 March 2008. It was the seventh women's scatch race appearance at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. 21 women from 21 countries participated in the race.\nAfter several attacks that did not come to anything Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands struck out alone with less than eight laps to go. No one else reacted and she rode solo to the finish. The sprint of the peloton behind Van Dijk was won by Yumari González of Cuba who took the silver medal with Belinda Goss from Australia taking bronze.\nQualification.\nQualification for the race was restricted to one cyclist per nation for the countries in the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) individual standings as of 18 February 2008, after the fourth and final round of the 2007–08 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics. Additionally, one place was available at the B World Championship, one place at each continental championships and one wild card for nations that did not qualify through the UCI standing. National federations of the qualified countries selected the rider. The maximum quota of the event was set at 24 cyclists but only 21 cyclists were registered.\nCompetition format.\nA scratch race is a race in which all riders start together and the object is to cross the finish line. The competition consisted on 40 laps, making a total of 10 km without intermediate points or sprints.\nThere were no qualification rounds for this discipline so the event was run direct to the final.\nSchedule.\nSunday 30 March\n16:30-16:50 Final\n17:15:-17:25 Victory Ceremony\nPre-race favorites.\nNot all 2007–08 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics medalists could participate in the race because each qualified country was only allowed to select one rider. Beside that, not all countries selected their World Cup medalist, if they had one. The main favorite for the race was Yumari González from Cuba, the defending champion, who won the scratch race at the 2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and won the first World Cup race in Sydney and finished third in the second World Cup race in Beijing. The silver medalist of 2007, María Luisa Calle of Colombia, was also selected. The start list further included Belinda Goss of Australia, Jarmila Machačová from the Czech Republic and Annalisa Cucinotta from Italy who won all three a silver medal during a World Cup race. The Netherlands did not select Marianne Vos, who won two of the four World Cup races, but selected Ellen van Dijk instead.\nRace.\nThe race started at 16:30 British Summer Time (UTC+1) and was scheduled to last until 16:50. 21 women form 21 countries took part in the race.\nThe race had several attacks, the first meaningful one coming in only lap five from Aksana Papko of Belarus in an early bid to match her countryman Aliaksandr Lisouski's victory in the men's race on day one. She was chased down by a small group that included Svetlana Paulikaite of Lithuania, Svitlana Halyuk of Ukraine and Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. The rest of the bunch was very attentive at this early stage and they were soon back together. Paulikaite struck out alone, but her effort did not come to anything. A crash in the middle period of the race took down Catherine Cheatley of New Zealand and Spain's Gema Pascual Torrecilla after a touch of wheels near the back. Cheatley rejoined after a few minutes, but Torrecilla pulled out having fallen more heavily. More attacks continued, but all were reeled. With less than eight laps to go, Van Dijk struck out alone and no one else reacted. She overtook the Danish rider Trine Schmidt from an earlier escape and had soon almost half lap lead. The rest of the riders did not react and looked to each other. Despite having almost half a lap on the rest of the bunch, Van Dijk refused to start getting complacent and kept going. When a chase did materialise, it was too late and Van Dijk finished alone with a considerable gap to take the gold medal and the rainbow jersey. Behind Van Dijk the sprint was won by the 2007 champion Yumari González Valdivieso of Cuba, ahead of Belinda Goss from Australia. Annalisa Cucinotta of Italy was fourth and Rebecca Quinn from the United States of America finished fifth.\nFinal classifications.\nThe victory ceremony was held at 17:15 British Summer Time (UTC+1). The winner was awarded the rainbow jersey and the top three riders got flowers and respectively a gold, silver and bronze medal.\nSource\nMedalists reactions.\n\"I was never World champion so it is my biggest victory so far! I was focused on the individual pursuit, everything for me was on that. My individual pursuit was good, but I was fifth and just missed the finals. I was very disappointed because I also missed the Olympic Games, because I only started riding [world cups] on the track four months ago. I didn't have enough points to ride in the individual pursuit in the Olympics.\" About the scratch race she continued: \"My plan was to attack about 10 laps from the finish, I wanted to go when the speed was a bit lower. I did it about eight laps before the finish. I was surprised, but every country has just one rider so they don't work together. That was better for me to ride away. I didn't look behind, just once\", she added. \"I knew I had to give it everything and if there was no gap, then there was no gap. But it worked out well.\" Despite having quite a considerable gap coming into the final lap, Van Dijk refused to believe that the race was won until the very end. She detailed the point at which she realised that she was definitely going to triumph. \"Just 100 metres before the finish\", she said. \"I didn't know how big the gap was [before then], I didn't look back, I was just focused on riding hard and getting everything out.\" A few days on from the frustration of non-qualification, her new rainbow jersey and gold medal provide her with a great deal of compensation. \"I was really, really disappointed with that\", she confirmed. \"But this makes up for it.\"\n\"The race was very fast.\" She told the assembled media. \"I didn't feel very good but at the end I was able to get the silver medal so I am happy about that.\"\n\"I'm certainly stoked by the result. It is such a great improvement on last year. It would have been great to have got gold, the top prize, but I am really happy. It has been a long wait. I had to put it in my head that I'd get in some training this week, get a bit fitter. But I am really happy with myself; things have been going well for me. I rode well in Europe last year.\""

In 1982, the sport was elevated to revenue status, which meant more money was available. Under Coach Lin Dunn, Purdue qualified for its first NCAA Tournament game in 1989. Ten years later, Purdue won its first national championship by beating Duke University in the title game. Sharon Versyp, a former Purdue standout, was introduced as the head coach at the start of the 2006 season.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nSource:\nYear by year results.\nConference tournament winners noted with # Source "

Kuniyoshi was known for his depictions of historical and mythical scenes, and combined both in portraying the tenth-century princess Takiyasha summoning a skeleton spectre to frighten Ōya no Mitsukuni.\nIn the image, the princess recites a spell written on a handscroll, summoning a giant skeleton. It rears out of a black void, crashing its way through the tattered palace blinds with its bony fingers to menace Mitsukuni and his companion.\nA copy of the print is housed in the Honolulu Museum of Art in the United States, having been donated by its previous owner, Victor S. K. Houston, in 1941.\nHistorical context.\nThe historical Princess Takiyasha was the daughter of the provincial warlord Taira no Masakado of Sōma, who tried to set up an \"Eastern Court\" in Shimōsa Province in competition with the emperor in Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto). That rebellion was put down in the year 939 and he was defeated, then decapitated. After his death, Princess Takiyasha continued living in the ruined shōen, or rural manor-house, of the Sōma clan, Masakado's former residence.\nThis print shows a mythical episode in which the emperor's official, Mitsukuni, comes to search for surviving insurrectionary conspirators."

        "title": "Basketball Arena (London)",
        "text": "The Basketball Arena for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics was located in the Olympic Park in Stratford, London. The arena was designed to be fully recyclable, and was dismantled in January 2013, the seating was sold to Barnet owner Tony Kleanthous to be used in the construction of The Hive Stadium.\nHistory.\nLondon's Olympic bid proposed that there would be four arenas in the Olympic Park, but the revised masterplan published in 2006 reduced this to three, with the volleyball matches being moved to Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The fencing arena was also cancelled, and the fencing took place at ExCeL.\nThe Basketball Arena had 12,000 seats for Olympic basketball and the semi-finals and finals of Olympic handball, and 10,000 for Paralympic wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. The arena was also used as a holding area for athletes during the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the games. Concept designs by Wilkinson Eyre Architects &amp; KSS Design Group were agreed in June 2008 and a planning application was submitted in November 2008. It was a temporary venue, and the largest built for any Olympic games. The possibility of subsequently deconstructing the arena and transporting it to Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Summer Olympics was discussed, though the plan was shelved due to doubts from some Brazilian officials about its feasibility.\nIn early October 2008 it was speculated that Wembley Arena could be used as a replacement venue for the preliminary rounds of the 2012 Olympic basketball tournament instead of the Basketball Arena, thus saving up to £90 million, but in March 2009 it was confirmed that a new arena would be built in Stratford as originally proposed.\nIn late October 2009, preparatory work had begun on the site and Paisley-based Barr Construction would begin building the main arena in spring 2010. The basketball arena took 15 months to build and was completed in June 2011.\nSustainability was an important concern. The arena was made out of sturdy individual components that could be easily dismantled and sub-divided for reuse elsewhere, with over two-thirds of the materials and components to be recyclable.\nThe test event for the arena was the London International Basketball Invitational competition, which took place between 16 and 21 August 2011. For the test event, the venue had a capacity of 3,000.\nConstruction.\nInstead of using a concrete sub-structure, a lightweight steel frame was used, with cladding. This meant the building (frame and cladding) was constructed in six weeks. The venue, a 30-metre-high rectangular volume (the equivalent of a seven-storey building) was made out of a steel portal frame and wrapped in 20,000 square metres of lightweight phthalate-free and recyclable PVC plastic. This translucent bespoke cladding was then stretched across the steel framing modules that pushed the fabric out and created the three-dimensional undulating pattern along the sides. An interwoven blackout layer was used in the roof fabric, this reduced most of the daylight during game sessions and maintained a fully controllable artificial lighting for use by the media and game spectators. The external fabric walls were translucent, allowing daylight to pass through during the day and artificial lighting to be visible during the evening.\nThe architects worked with United Visual Artists (specialists in concert lighting and installations) to create lighting and colour-changing effects for the evening games. The result was a dynamic illumination which, at night, transforms the white surface into a variety of saturated colours and strong silhouettes of the steel frame, creating the biggest light installation on the Olympic park.\nThe arena was constructed with materials that could be recycled efficiently. The arena was officially put up for sale on 20 January 2013 by GL events Slick Seating.\nAn agreement was made with Tony Kleanthous and Barnet that the seating used in the arena would be coloured orange and black, so that Barnet could purchase the seating after the venue was dismantled and use it in the construction of their new ground, The Hive."

It took place throughout September and October and featured a field of 29 players. The inaugural championship – the 2008 Championship League Darts – was held at the Crondon Park Golf Club in Essex and featured a prize fund of £189,000 and a place in the Grand Slam of Darts for the winner. Phil Taylor won the inaugural championship.\nThe final tournament was held in 2013.\nInternet coverage.\nAs there were no spectators in the playing room, coverage was exclusive to the Internet. The choice to broadcast the tournament over the Internet had been partly inspired by the Championship League snooker event and was also a successor to the live streaming of certain matches from the Blue Square UK Open regional finals from the PDC Pro Tour. The streaming was aided by the company Perform, a digital sports agency. Live streaming of every game was available on several sports betting websites, and was available internationally except in the United States of America where, for legal reasons, the Championship could not be shown."

Founded in 1928, it is one of the oldest volleyball clubs in Cyprus. Anorthosis have the most title wins in Cyprus, with 21 Cypriot Championship titles and 16 Cypriot Cup titles.\nHistory.\nThe history of department volleyball of Anorthosis is identified with the history of sport in Cyprus. The sport made its appearance in Famagusta in the 1920s with instructor and professor of gymnastics, Anastassis Economides. According to the proceedings of the meetings of the administrative council of Anorthosis, the sport of volleyball was added on 11 June 1928 with water polo. That season they were playing friendly matches, while the volleyball players of Anorthosis they were playing with the colours of the Gymnastic Association Evagoras (where it was creation of members of Anorthosis) at the duration of the Pancyprian Fights. Historians report that the period of 1928–1954 \"under the wise man guidance of Anastassis Economides, the team of volleyball gave to Anorthosis a lot of first victories, a lot of glory and filled the rooms of association with bowls and medals\". The volleyball teams of Anorthosis participated in the most tournaments that were carried out in the amateur base up to 1972, initially under the aegis of local committee SEGAS Cyprus and afterwards the Pancyprian Federation of Sports, while the athletes of Anorthosis also played a leading part in the distribution of beach volleyball that made an appearance at the end of the 1940s.\nIn 1972, with the creation of EOPE (Greek Federation of Volleyball) Anorthosis Volleyball Club, developed appreciable activity with climax the conquest Pan-Hellenic of championship (unbeaten) and its attendance in the A' championship of National category. Anorthosis is the unique team that fought in Pan-Hellenic Championship. However, the Turkish invasion deprived from the team of Famagusta, her eve in \"giants\" the Greek volleyball, after it was forced to withdraw five fighting before the end. If overcame even one opponent in the five games that remained her eve in A' National Category was certain. \nThe period after the invasion was exceptionally difficult. Substantially without seat, without athletic material… However, the players of Anorthosis exceeded each obstacle and made their association in big protagonist in the sport monopolizing the titles in a lot of cases. With 19 conquests of championship, 14 conquests of cup, 7 Super Cups and 11 Doubles, it is the team with the bigger successes in the Cypriot question volleyball. In the season 2009–10, with trainer Petros Kontos, Anorthosis occupied the 1st place in the championship.\nThe department of women's volleyball recrudesced for little in Larnaca after the Turkish invasion in 1974. In 1987, with initiative of Level of Anorthosis in Nicosia, the department \"is built\" in robustly foundations by their fans that live in Nicosia and from then participates regularly in the activities of the KOPE with bigger successes conquest 5 Super Cups, four championships and four cups."

        "title": "2009 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2009 Giro d'Italia was the 92nd running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It was held from 9 to 31 May 2009, and marked the 100th year since the first edition of the race. Starting in Venice and finishing in Rome, 22 teams competed over 21 stages. Four of the top ten finishers in this edition later had their results voided.\nThe Giro was raced on a unique path through Italy, taking the peloton to some historic cities and towns in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any well-known, storied climbs, the many intermediate and mountain stages in the second and third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult. The 10th and the 16th stages were both called the race's queen stage, as both contained multiple difficult mountain climbs.\nRiders protested during the ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was nominally about the overall safety conditions of the stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.\nDenis Menchov won the race, having taken the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended vigorously against attacks by his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41 seconds behind the winner, and won the mauve jersey as points classification winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams were announced for the Giro. These included fifteen ProTour teams, and seven Professional Continental teams. Three ProTour teams did not wish to participate, and were thus not invited: , , and . Conversely, the organizers of the race originally declined to invite , but changed this decision on 23 April, inviting them as the Giro's 22nd and final team. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists.\nThe 22 teams that took part in the race were: \nPre-race favorites.\nThe Astana team did not include 2008 race champion Alberto Contador, who chose not to defend his championship, but did include Lance Armstrong, who had recently returned from retirement. Though his appearance was put in doubt after he crashed out of stage 1 of the Vuelta a Castilla y León and broke his collarbone, Armstrong announced on 16 April that he would start the Giro despite undergoing surgery for his injury. star Cadel Evans was originally announced to be taking part in the Giro, but he publicly announced shortly afterward that he would not ride it, and accused RCS Sport (the organizers of the race) of using his name to promote the event. Contador and Evans both chose to focus on the Tour de France later in the season.\nMany riders were named as contenders, including Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong was considered an overall favorite, and it was also noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.\nFormer winner Stefano Garzelli named Leipheimer as the favorite, as did some American media outlets. Armstrong considered Basso to be the favorite when speaking about the Giro in December 2008. Other news outlets also referred to Basso as the pre-race favorite.\nOnly a small number of stages were expected to end in a sprint, barring a successful breakaway. Sprinters in the event included Mark Cavendish, Alessandro Petacchi, Allan Davis, Filippo Pozzato, Robert Hunter, Robert Förster, Tyler Farrar, Juan José Haedo, and Oscar Gatto.\nRoute and stages.\nThe first Giro d'Italia was held in 1909, and the 2009 route was designed to commemorate the 100th anniversary, though interruptions due to World War I and World War II meant this was only the 92nd race. Milan, which had for years been the city in which the Giro concluded, was the site of a ten-lap criterium on the same circuit that began the first Giro d'Italia. Every city that hosted a stage start or finish in the first Giro was visited in 2009 with the exception of Genoa, although Arenzano (in the province of Genoa) hosted the finish to stage 11. The 11th stage also went over the Passo del Turchino, a climb used every year in the classic cycling race Milan–San Remo.\nThe tenth stage was planned to mimic stage 17 of the 1949 Giro d'Italia, which was won by Italian cycling legend Fausto Coppi en route to the overall victory. That route originally included the Col d'Izoard, a climb in France which has been featured in the Tour de France numerous times. Race organizers were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio communication in the area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides. It was subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb added. Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over Monte Petrano and two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's queen stage.\nThe route received a small amount of criticism for failing to include any well-known and especially difficult climbs such as the Passo del Mortirolo or Monte Zoncolan, instead including stages featuring multiple climbs with lesser ascents. Race director Angelo Zomegnan responded to the criticism by saying, \"I won't follow the philosophy that the selection of climbs has to be determined by their names.\"\nThe 21 stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia were divided into five categories: one team time trial, seven flat stages, four intermediate stages, seven mountain stages and two individual time trials. The type of stage together with the average speed of the winner decided how much time each cyclist would be allowed to finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a team time trial in Lido, a barrier island in the city of Venice. The starting order of the teams was decided by a random draw. , the first team to take the course, won the stage, giving their star sprinter Mark Cavendish the first pink jersey as leader of the race. Cavendish was defeated in a sprint finish the following day by Italian Alessandro Petacchi, who was riding for the team. Petacchi became the next wearer of the pink jersey, after he won the Stage 3 sprint into Valdobbiadene. Cavendish went on to win three mass-start stages, but 's success was not limited to Cavendish's victories nor the team time trial, as Edvald Boasson Hagen and Kanstantsin Sivtsov also took stage wins.\nThe first two high mountain stages of the Giro revealed the men who would battle for the overall race title. Danilo Di Luca of took the win in Stage 4, and put himself just 2 seconds off the pink jersey. The next day, he claimed the jersey, when he was second to stage winner Denis Menchov at Alpe di Siusi as an elite group of favorites emerged including Menchov, Di Luca, and others who had performed well on the climb and were in high places in the overall standings.\nMenchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose to second before stage 12, the very long and hilly individual time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages to make up the time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.\nStefano Garzelli was the winner of the mountains classification, gaining points for consistent high placings on the summit stage finishes, as well as a brief breakaway on the mountainous stage 10. The points classification was won by Di Luca, after he finished in the top ten in eight of the road stages. The youth classification was won by Kevin Seeldraeyers, who remained consistent after Thomas Lövkvist lost nearly 25 minutes on stage 16. Lövkvist had, for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general classification.\nControversy arose during the ten-lap Milan criterium of the ninth stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding conditions in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly died as a result of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.\nThe protest at first only involved the criterium being neutralized – that is, the race director agreed that each rider would receive the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they actually crossed the line. After the riders rode a lap of the course, they decided instead not to contest the stage at all, riding the first six circuits slower than previous stages. After four laps, they stopped altogether as race leader Di Luca addressed the unhappy crowd to explain their actions. The times for the stage did not count, and there was no aggressive riding until a final sprint finish. Along with Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was considered the principal voice speaking for the peloton on this day. Although the protest was referred to by some as \"unanimous,\" cyclists such as Filippo Pozzato, who was himself bearing injuries sustained in a crash that would later force him to leave the race, said the riders had been too hasty in their decision, and that it should have been made conclusively before the stage began. Armstrong apologized to the fans for the effect the protest had on what was supposed to be a grand spectacle, but also contended that it was the correct decision for the peloton to make.\nSuccess in stages was limited to a few teams. Though there were nearly as many stages (21) as teams in the event (22), only eight teams ultimately came away with stage victories. Six different riders won multiple stages – Cavendish, Petacchi, Menchov, Di Luca, Carlos Sastre, and Michele Scarponi. Teammates of Sastre, Scarponi and Cavendish were also stage winners; Sastre's provided the winners to stages 14 (Simon Gerrans) and 21 (Ignatas Konovalovas), and Scarponi's teammate Leonardo Bertagnolli was the winner of stage 15. The only teams to be single stage winners were with Franco Pellizotti in stage 17, and with classics specialist Philippe Gilbert three days later in a stage thought to resemble a classic. Pellizotti was also the third-place overall finisher. With wins for Quick Step's Seeldraeyers in the youth classification, Garzelli of Acqua &amp; Sapone in the climbers' competition, and in the Trofeo Fast Team ranking, 11 teams – half of the total entries – won significant prizes during the race.\nAftermath.\nAbout two months after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was announced that second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had given two positive tests for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, an erythropoietin derivative) on 20 and 28 May, before the Cinque Terre time trial and the Mount Vesuvius stage in the race's final week. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling's governing body. It was announced on 8 August that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his results from the race. fired him on 13 August. Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy against him by the labs handling the tests. A period of legal maneuvering between Di Luca and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal (TNA) to suspend Di Luca for three years – while two years is a customary ban for a doping positive, CONI prosecutors sought a third year for recidivism, stemming from Di Luca's previous doping incident two years earlier. He was given a two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In October 2010, Di Luca was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the record. On 10 January 2011, he signed with and indicated that he would return to the Giro in 2011 to support Katusha team leader Joaquim Rodríguez.\nFive days before the start of the 2010 Giro d'Italia, 2009 podium finisher Pellizotti was identified as a rider of interest to the UCI's biological passport program due to irregular blood values. He was removed from his team's start list for the Giro and provisionally suspended. The UCI asked that CONI open disciplinary proceedings against him, which had no resolution until after the 2010 season finished. TNA cleared him on 21 October and declared him free to race, at which time the Liquigas team intended to re-sign him. The UCI decided in January 2011 to appeal his case to the CAS. The hearing was held in March, and Pellizotti asked for a quick resolution, with plans to return with in the 2011 Tirreno–Adriatico if he were cleared. The court reached its decision after five days, upholding the UCI's appeal, handing Pellizotti a two-year ban, and stripping all his results from this Giro and the 2009 Tour de France. Consequently, Pellizotti has said he is quitting the sport.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2009 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2009 was Sestrière in stage 10, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, which awarded a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1984 were eligible.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the \"Traguardo Volante\", or TV. The TV gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the TV classification. This award was known in previous years as the \"Intergiro\" and the \"Expo Milano 2015\" classification. It was won by Italian Giovanni Visconti, of .\nOther awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner Stefano Garzelli won this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by Danilo Di Luca. Additionally, the \"Trofeo Fuga Cervelo\" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Mauro Facci was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. and were most successful in avoiding penalties, and so shared leadership of the Fair Play classification.\nWorld Rankings points.\nThe Giro was one of 24 events throughout the season that contributed points towards the 2009 UCI World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 20 finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage."

        "text": "Paul Léo Émile Calvert (October 6, 1917 – February 1, 1999) was a Canadian professional baseball player. He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers over all or parts of seven seasons spanning 1942–51. Listed at tall and , he batted and threw right-handed. In 109 MLB games (27 as a starting pitcher) and innings pitched, Calvert allowed 345 hits and 158 bases on balls. He struck out 102, threw five complete games and earned five saves.\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Calvert broke into professional baseball in 1938. He spent most of the year playing in the Quebec Provincial League, at the time a minor league unaffiliated with MLB. He then played in three games for the Montreal Royals, and showed enough promise that the New York Giants gave him a tryout, but they passed on signing him as they felt he needed more experience. After spending 1939 out of organized baseball, Calvert was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization to a contract in 1940, and was invited to spring training. He then spent the season with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, playing in 21 total games for the two teams. He spent 1941 with Cedar Rapids, and finished the year with six wins, three losses, and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 11 games.\nHe signed with the Cleveland organization and in 1942 he won 17 of 24 decisions with a 2.22 ERA with Wilkes-Barre. That led to his call up to the Indians' roster when he made his MLB debut with two scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox on September 24 in his only major league appearance of the season.\nCalvert spent three full seasons—1944, 1949, and 1950—in the big leagues. His most notable campaign, 1949 with the Senators, saw him lead the American League in games lost (17) and in pitchers' fielding percentage (1.000 in 55 chances). His minor league career essentially ended after the 1952 season, although he got into three games in 1955 with the Class C Modesto Reds."

        "title": "City of Cambridge Rowing Club",
        "text": "City of Cambridge Rowing Club (CCRC) is the oldest 'town' (or CRA) rowing and sculling club in Cambridge, UK, and with about 300 members, it has one of the largest active rowing memberships in the region. The club's colours are dark blue, with a band of claret sandwiched between two bands of 'old gold'.\nThe club has one of the most successful historic records in town rowing as the only club to hold the men's headship for ten successive years (between 1951 and 1961), and its recent record includes winning the John Jenner trophy as the most successful club in Town Bumps for four successive years (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), with its women having reached \"Head of the River\" in 2008. The club also won the Lester Trophy (for Intermediate Club Coxed Fours) at Henley Women's Regatta in 2010.\nThe club has squads for all ages and abilities, including juniors, men, women, masters and novices.\nFacilities.\nThe club was the first Cambridge town rowing club to build its own boathouse on the banks of the River Cam, and it is still based at the same site, in the main row of boathouses opposite Midsummer Common. Many local CRA races are run from this clubhouse. In July 2019, the club opened a new 3 storey boathouse, giving it the newest town club boathouse on the river Cam. The new boat house has a large boat bay on the ground floor, club room and changing rooms on the first floor and gym on the top floor.\nThe club has a large fleet of racing shells and training boats, with a mixture of 8's, 4+/-/x and small boats. The club's boats have ARA alphanumeric registration codes starting with the letters \"CAM\" followed by three digits.\nRacing.\nThe club competes all year round at local CRA races on the River Cam, at regional regattas and head races such as those at Peterborough, Bedford and Norwich, and at major national events including Men's and Women's Tideway Head of the River Races, Henley Women's Regatta, Henley Royal Regatta and the National Championships. Club crews also occasionally compete at international events such as the Head of the Charles, the Galway Head and FISA Masters.\nThe biggest race in the local calendar is the CRA Bumps (or \"town bumps\") in which almost all club members participate. In 2008, the women's squad reached first position (\"Head\") in this race.\nCCRC Events.\nThe club hosts and runs several local rowing races on the River Cam, including the CRA Winter League (a \"league\" event run over the Cam Head Course over three successive months), the Head 2 Head races (where the standard Head Course is rowed twice in quick succession; first downstream and then, minutes later, in the more usual upstream direction) in spring and winter, the CCRC Sprint Regatta (a short ~400 m side-by-side sprint regatta outside the boathouses along Midsummer Common) and the Christmas Head (an upstream race past most of the boathouses).\nHistory.\nCity of Cambridge is the oldest town rowing club on the Cam. Early records show the existence of the 'Cambridge Boat Racing Club' in 1844, the largest contingent of which went on to become the 'Cambridge Town Rowing Club' in 1863. The Town club was formed by John Harvey in the working men's club that used to be on Market Hill; this formed the core of what became CCRC in 1932. The club's colours are dark blue, Claret and Old Gold.\nRecords are scarce for the first part of the twentieth century, with results in both the Bumps and the Eight's Head on the Thames existing from the late 1940s onwards. In 1953 the first eight finished 53rd on the Thames and held the headship in the Town Bumps. In the same year, the club's 90th anniversary, the first Town regatta was run on the Cam. The course ran from the Pike and Eel all the way down the long reach and round to the Plough. The Cambridge Daily News reported that R. Evans of St Neots was disqualified for knocking M. Clay of Nottingham and Union into the river during their singles race. Clay appeared to collect the trophy 'soaked to the skin, his hair on end and in bare feet'. The City Sprints are now held in front of the boat houses over a shorter course.\nCity purchased the freehold to the boathouse in 1959 and in 1963 celebrated its official centenary by opening its new boathouse. In July 2019, the club opened a new 3 storey boathouse, giving it the largest town club boathouse on the river Cam.\nBumps Racing.\nUniversity Bumps races had been held from the 1820s onwards but the town bumps only really took shape with the formation of the CRA (Cambridgeshire Rowing Association) in 1868. City were head of the river in the Town Bumps in 1875 but performed poorly until 1914 when they reached third place. In 1949 the 1st boat won their blades and in 1951 they were head of the river for the first time since the headship was lost in the 1870s. They retained the headship for the next 6 years and in 1958 had the chance to equal Rob Roy's record of 8 consecutive headships (set from 1904 to 1911).\nIn the buildup to the 1958 Bumps, Robs and City posted identical times in the 'Timed Race'. On the first night of the Bumps proper Robs caught 99's to go second and leave themselves three nights to catch City. But for all their endeavour Robs could not bump a determined City crew and the record was equalled. City went on to retain the headship for a further two years and a new record of 10 consecutive years of Headship was thus set by City before they were eventually toppled in 1962 by 99's."

        "title": "American football",
        "text": "American football (referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada), also known as gridiron football, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. A game is won by the team with the higher number of points, which are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.\nAmerican football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football\", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game, although its rules were developed independently from those of Camp. Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football. The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.\nAmerican football is the most popular sport in the United States in terms of broadcast viewership audience. The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high-school and youth football. , nearly 1.04 million high-school athletes play the sport in the U.S., with another 81,000 college athletes in the NCAA and the NAIA. The National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events globally. In 2022, the league had an annual revenue of around $18.6 billion, making it the most valuable sports league in the world. Other professional and amateur leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball; the sport maintains a growing following in the rest of North America, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.\nEtymology and names.\nIn the United States, American football is referred to as \"football\". The term \"football\" was officially established in the rulebook for the 1876 college football season, when the sport first shifted from soccer-style rules to rugby-style rules. Although it could easily have been called \"rugby\" at this point, Harvard, one of the primary proponents of the rugby-style game, compromised and did not request the name of the sport be changed to \"rugby\". The terms \"gridiron\" or \"American football\" are favored in English-speaking countries where other types of football are popular, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAmerican football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport in which two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.\nWhat is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton, two college teams. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head, or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6–4. Collegiate play continued for several years with matches played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873, to create a standard set of rules for use by all schools. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball. After playing McGill University using both American (known as \"the Boston game\") for the first game and Canadian (rugby) rules for the second one, the Harvard players preferred the Canadian style of having only 11 men on the field, running the ball without having to be chased by an opponent, the forward pass, tackling, and using an oblong instead of a round ball.\nAn 1875 Harvard–Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two Princeton athletes who were impressed by it. They introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the Professional Football Researchers Association compared to \"selling refrigerators to Eskimos\". Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system. These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player Walter Camp, now regarded as the \"Father of American Football\", secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap to replace the chaotic and inconsistent scrum. While the game between Rutgers and Princeton is commonly considered the first American football game, several years prior in 1862, the Oneida Football Club formed as the oldest known football club in the United States. The team consisted of graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools and played from 1862 to 1865.\nEvolution of the game.\nThe introduction of the snap resulted in an unexpected consequence. Before the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, in a game between Yale and Princeton, both teams used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0–0 tie. This \"block game\" proved extremely unpopular with both teams' spectators and fans.\nA rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three downs, or tackles, to advance the ball . Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a gridiron in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown, and five for a goal from the field. Additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized, and a static line of scrimmage was instituted.\nDespite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths. A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made. In response, 62 colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905. These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\nThe legal forward pass was introduced in 1906, although its effect was initially minimal due to the restrictions placed on its use. The idea of a 40-yard-wider field was opposed by Harvard due to the size of the new Harvard Stadium. Other rule changes introduced that year included the reduction of playing time from 70 to 60 minutes and an increase of the distance required for a first down from . To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the neutral zone was created along the width of the football before the snap. Scoring was also adjusted: points awarded for field goals were reduced to three in 1909 and points for touchdowns were raised to six in 1912. Also in 1912, the field was shortened to long, two end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball . The roughing the passer penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field in 1918.\nProfessional era.\nOn November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 () to play a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association in a match against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not prohibited outright.\nOver time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team. By 1922, the NFL had established itself as America's premier professional football league.\nThe dominant form of football at the time was played at the collegiate level. The upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925, however, when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons, defeated a team of Notre Dame all-stars in an exhibition game. A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to distinguish itself further from the college game during the late 1930s. Football, in general, became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game, a match between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants that is still referred to as the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". The game, a 23–17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major influence on the popularity of the sport. This, along with the innovations introduced by the new American Football League (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.\nThe rival AFL arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the ABC television network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to professional football in the United States: official time was kept on a scoreboard clock rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players who had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record $437,000 contract (equivalent to $ million in ). A five-year, $40 million NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966 when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that took full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. This championship game began play at the end of the 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl.\nCollege football maintained a tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game was associated with a particular conference and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1997. The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).\nTeams and positions.\nA football game is played between two teams of 11 players each. Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty. Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs; this \"platoon\" system replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams units. The number of players allowed on an active roster varies by league; the NFL has a 53-man roster, while NCAA Division I allows teams to have 63 scholarship players in the FCS and 85 scholarship players in the FBS, respectively. \nIndividual players in a football game must be designated with a uniform number between 1 and 99, though some teams may \"retire\" certain numbers, making them unavailable to players. NFL teams are required to number their players by a league-approved numbering system, and any exceptions must be approved by the commissioner. NCAA and NFHS teams are \"strongly advised\" to number their offensive players according to a league-suggested numbering scheme.\nAlthough the sport is played almost exclusively by men, women are eligible to play in high school, college, and professional football. No woman has ever played in the NFL, but women have played in high school and college football games. In 2018, 1,100 of the 225,000 players in Pop Warner Little Scholars youth football were girls, and around 11% of the 5.5 million Americans who report playing tackle football are female according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association.\nOffensive unit.\nThe role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown.\nThe offensive team must line up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can line up temporarily in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they report the change immediately to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, except the center (C), are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.\nThe main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB), and fullback (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either the quarterback or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it, or runs with it.\nThe primary role of the halfback, also known as the running back or tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage or goal-line situations. They are seldom used as receivers.\nThe offensive line (OL) consists of several players whose primary function is to block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of the offensive line is the center, who is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.\nThe principal receivers are the wide receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.\nDefensive unit.\nThe role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles).\nThe defensive line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles are to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.\nLinebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers tend to serve as the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays, given their vantage point of the offensive backfield. Their roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and tackling backs, wide receivers, and tight ends in the passing game.\nThe defensive backfield, often called the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite a receiver to be able to cover them. Safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties tend to be viewed as \"the last line of defense\" and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as breakout running plays.\nSpecial teams unit.\nThe special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball tries to execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts, and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.\nThree positions are specific to the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H), and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).\nThe positions specific to punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, upback, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR)—the player who catches the punt. Upbacks line up a short distance behind the line of scrimmage, providing additional protection to the punter.\nRules.\nScoring.\nIn football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game. The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone. The scoring team then attempts a try, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT) or conversion, which is a single scoring opportunity. This is generally attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is scored by what would normally be a touchdown, it is worth two points; this is known as a two-point conversion. In general, the extra point is almost always successful, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.\nA field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts. In practice, almost all field goal attempts are done via place kick. While drop kicks were common in the early days of the sport, the shape of modern footballs makes it difficult to reliably drop kick the ball. The last successful scoring play by drop kick in the NFL was accomplished in 2006; prior to that, the last successful drop kick had been made in 1941. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.\nA safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense. In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick.\nField and equipment.\nFootball games are played on a rectangular field that measures long and wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known as the end lines and sidelines. Goal lines are marked inward from each end line.\nWeighted pylons are placed the sidelines on the inside corner of the intersections with the goal lines and end lines. White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone. Inbound lines, or hash marks, are short parallel lines that mark off increments. Yard lines, which can run the width of the field, are marked every . A one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.\nGoalposts are located at the center of the plane of the two end lines. The crossbar of these posts is above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar apart for professional and collegiate play, and apart for high school play. The uprights extend vertically on professional fields, a minimum of on college fields, and a minimum of on high school fields. Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are normally placed at the tip of each upright as indicators of wind strength and direction.\nThe football itself is a prolate spheroid leather ball, similar to the balls used in rugby or Australian rules football. To contain the compressed air within it, a pig's bladder was commonly used before the advent of artificial rubber inside the leather outer shell to sustain crushing forces. At all levels of play, the football is inflated to , or just under one atmosphere, and weighs ; beyond that, the exact dimensions vary slightly. In professional play the ball has a long axis of , a long circumference of , and a short circumference of . In college and high school play the ball has a long axis of , a long circumference of , and a short circumference of .\nDuration and time stoppages.\nFootball games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided into two halves of 30 minutes and four quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two halves of 24 minutes and four quarters of 12 minutes. The two halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are followed by a short break. Before the game starts, the referee and each team's captain meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team can call either \"heads\" or \"tails\"; the winner of the toss chooses whether to receive or kick off the ball or which goal they wish to defend. They can defer their choice until the second half. Unless the winning team decides to defer, the losing team chooses the option the winning team did not select—to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed. If certain fouls are committed during play while time has expired, the quarter may be extended through an untimed down.\nGames last longer than their defined length due to play stoppages—the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game is measured by the game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate play clock is used to show the amount of time within which the offense must initiate a play. The play clock is set to 25 seconds after certain administrative stoppages in play and to 40 seconds when play is proceeding without such stoppages. If the offense fails to start a play before the play clock reads \"00\", a delay of game foul is called on the offense.\nAdvancing the ball and downs.\nThere are two main ways the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the center passes the ball backwards and between their legs to the quarterback in a process known as the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a running back, throws the ball, or runs with it. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out-of-bounds or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can be legally attempted only if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage; only one forward pass can be attempted per down. As in rugby, players can also pass the ball backwards at any point during a play. In the NFL, a down also ends immediately if the runner's helmet comes off.\nThe offense is given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from farther down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might attempt to score a field goal instead. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.\nKicking.\nThere are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts the first and third quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal; the safety kick follows a safety.\nOn a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop kicked or place kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or a tee; a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop kick or place kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball. The ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.\nThe three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball. The receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch, which prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver. The play ends as soon as the ball is caught, and the ball may not be advanced.\nOfficials and fouls.\nOfficials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a weighted yellow flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal. Women can serve as officials; Sarah Thomas became the NFL's first female official in 2015. The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the college level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:\nAnother set of officials, the chain crew, are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people—two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.\nSafety and brain health.\nFootball is a full-contact sport, and injuries are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet and a set of shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions.\nRepeated concussions (and possibly sub-concussive head impacts) can increase a person's risk in later life for CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's \"Heads Up Football\" program aims to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the \"Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine\" found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.\nA 2018 study performed by the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Boston University School of Medicine found that tackle football before age 12 was correlated with earlier onset of symptoms of CTE, but not with symptom severity. More specifically, each year a player played tackle football under age 12 predicted earlier onset of cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems by an average of two and a half years.\nLeagues and tournaments.\nThe National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are the most popular football leagues in the United States. The National Football League was founded in 1920 and has since become the largest and most popular sport in the United States. The NFL has the highest average attendance of any sporting league in the world, with an average attendance of 66,960 during the 2011 NFL season. The NFL championship game is called the Super Bowl, and is among the biggest events in club sports worldwide. It is played between the champions of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC), and its winner is awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy.\nCollege football is the third-most popular sport in the United States, behind professional baseball and professional football. The NCAA, the largest collegiate organization, is divided into three Divisions: Division I, Division II and Division III. Division I football is further divided into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The champions of each level of play are determined through NCAA-sanctioned playoff systems; while the champion of Division I-FBS was historically determined by various polls and ranking systems, the subdivision adopted a four-team playoff system in 2014.\nHigh school football is the most popular sport in the United States played by boys; over 1.1 million boys participated in the sport from 2007 to 2008 according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). There is a stark contrast in youth football participation between boys and girls. Only one youth football league exists in the United States for girls, the GFL. The NFHS is the largest organization for high school football, with member associations in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia. USA Football is the governing body for youth and amateur football, and Pop Warner Little Scholars is the largest organization for youth football.\nOther professional leagues.\nRival leagues.\nThe most successful league to directly compete with the NFL was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in 1964 before signing a five-year, US$36 million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began signing NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all the AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), was in play from 1946 to 1949. After it had dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.\nOther attempts to start rival leagues since the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970 have been far less successful, as professional football salaries and the NFL's television contracts began to escalate out of the reach of competitors and the NFL covered more of the larger cities. The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced such severe monetary issues it could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before the season could be completed. The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985. Originally not intended as a rival league, the entry of owners who sought marquee talent and to challenge the NFL led to an escalation in salaries and ensuing financial losses. A subsequent US$1.5 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only $1 in damages, which was automatically tripled to $3 under antitrust law.\nComplementary national leagues.\nThe original XFL, created in 2001 by Vince McMahon, lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN, and high expectations, the XFL suffered from low quality of play and poor reception for its use of tawdry professional wrestling gimmicks, which caused initially high ratings and attendance to collapse. The XFL was rebooted in 2020. However, after only five weeks of play, the league's operations slowly came to a close due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and filed for bankruptcy on April 13. The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009 but folded after suspending its 2012 season amid declining interest and lack of major television coverage. The Alliance of American Football lasted less than one season, unable to keep investors.\nInternational play.\nAmerican football leagues exist throughout the world, but the game has yet to achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball. It is not an Olympic sport, but it was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Summer Olympics. At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier. These countries rank far below the United States, which is dominant at the international level.\nNFL Europa, the developmental league of the NFL, operated from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 2007. At the time of its closure, NFL Europa had five teams based in Germany and one in the Netherlands. In Germany, the German Football League (GFL) has 16 teams and has operated for over 40 seasons, with the league's championship game, the German Bowl, closing out each season. The league operates in a promotion and relegation structure with German Football League 2 (GFL2), which also has 16 teams. The BIG6 European Football League functions as a continental championship for Europe. The competition is contested between the top six European teams.\nThe United Kingdom also operated several teams within NFL Europe during the League's tenure. The resulting rise in popularity of the sport brought the NFL back to the country in 2007 where they now hold the NFL International Series in London, currently consisting of four regular season games. The continuing interest and growth in both the sport and the series has led to the possible formation of a potential NFL franchise in London\nAn American football league system already exists within the UK, the BAFANL, which has run under various guises since 1983. It currently has 70 teams operating across the tiers of contact football in which teams aim to earn promotion to the Division above, with the Premier Division teams competing to win the Britbowl, the annual British Football Bowl game that has been played since 1985. In 2007, the British Universities American Football League was formed. From 2008, the BUAFL was officially associated with the National Football League (NFL), through its partner organization NFL UK. In 2012, BUAFL's league and teams were absorbed into BUCS after American football became an official BUCS sport. Over the period 2007 to 2014, the BUAFL grew from 42 teams and 2,460 participants to 75 teams and over 4,100 people involved.\nAmerican football federations are present in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania; a total of 75 national football federations exist . The International Federation of American Football (IFAF), an international governing body composed of continental federations, runs tournaments such as the IFAF World Championship, the IFAF Women's World Championship, the IFAF U-19 World Championship, and the Flag Football World Championship. The IFAF also organizes the annual International Bowl game. The IFAF has received provisional recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Several major obstacles hinder the IFAF goal of achieving status as an Olympic sport. These include the predominant participation of men in international play and the short three-week Olympic schedule. Large team sizes are an additional difficulty, due to the Olympics' set limit of 10,500 athletes and coaches. American football also has an issue with a lack of global visibility. Nigel Melville, the CEO of USA Rugby, noted that \"American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally.\" To solve these concerns, major effort has been put into promoting flag football, a modified version of American football, at the international level. Flag football has been shortlisted for appearance at the 2028 Summer Olympics, pending final approval by the International Olympic Committee.\nPopularity and cultural influence.\nUnited States.\n\"Baseball is still called the national pastime, but football is by far the more popular sport in American society\", according to ESPN.com's Sean McAdam. In a 2014 poll conducted by Harris Interactive, professional football ranked as the most popular sport, and college football ranked third behind only professional football and baseball; 46% of participants ranked some form of the game as their favorite sport. Professional football has ranked as the most popular sport in the poll since 1985, when it surpassed baseball for the first time. Professional football is most popular among those who live in the eastern United States and rural areas, while college football is most popular in the southern United States and among people with graduate and post-graduate degrees. Football is also the most-played sport by high school and college athletes in the United States. , the National Football Foundation reports nearly 1.04 million high-school athletes play the sport, with another 81,000 college athletes across both the NCAA and the NAIA; in comparison, the second-most played sport, basketball, had around 920,000 participants in high school and 63,000 in college.\nThe Super Bowl is the most popular single-day sporting event in the United States, and is among the biggest club sporting events in the world in terms of TV viewership. The NFL made approximately $12 billion in revenue in 2022. Super Bowl games account for eight of the top ten most-watched broadcasts in American history; Super Bowl LVII, played on February 12, 2023, was watched by a record 115.1 million Americans, and is second only to the Apollo 11 moon landing (125 million viewers).\nAmerican football also plays a significant role in American culture. The day on which the Super Bowl is held is considered a \"de facto\" national holiday, and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion. Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date so as not to conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule. Thanksgiving football is another American tradition, hosting many high school, college, and professional games. Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.\nOther countries.\nIn Canada, the game has a significant following. According to a 2013 poll, 21% of respondents said they followed the NFL \"very closely\" or \"fairly closely\", making it the third-most followed league behind the National Hockey League (NHL) and Canadian Football League (CFL). American football also has a long history in Mexico, which was introduced to the sport in 1896. It was the second-most popular sport in Mexico in the 1950s, with the game being particularly popular in colleges. The \"Los Angeles Times\" notes the NFL claims over 16 million fans in Mexico, which places the country third behind the U.S. and Canada. American football is played in Mexico both professionally and as part of the college sports system. A professional league, the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA), was founded in 2016.\nJapan was introduced to the sport in 1934 by Paul Rusch, a teacher and Christian missionary who helped to establish football teams at three universities in Tokyo. Play was halted during World War II by order of Emperor Hirohito, but the sport began growing in popularity again after the war. , there are more than 400 high school football teams in Japan, with over 15,000 participants, and over 100 teams play in the Kantoh Collegiate Football Association (KCFA). The X-League is the largest American football league in Japan, and the largest American football league in the world to use a promotion-relegation system. Some teams in the X-League, like the Panasonic Impulse, are sponsored by corporations, and all Japanese players on these teams are employed by the corporation. The league operates in separate spring and fall seasons, with each team playing five games. The top eight teams make the playoffs, which are played in Tokyo Dome; the champion is determined by the Rice Bowl. \nEurope is a major target for the expansion of the game by football organizers. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the sport was popular, with the 1986 Super Bowl being watched by over four million people (about 1 out of every 14 Britons). Its popularity faded during the 1990s, coinciding with the establishment of the Premier League—top level of the English football league system. According to BBC America, there is a \"social stigma\" surrounding American football in the UK, with many Brits feeling the sport has no right to call itself \"football\" due to the lack of emphasis on kicking. Nonetheless, the sport has retained a following in the United Kingdom; the NFL operates a media network in the country, and since 2007 has hosted the NFL International Series in London. Super Bowl viewership has also rebounded, with over 4.4 million Britons watching Super Bowl XLVI. The sport is played in European countries like Switzerland, which has American football clubs in every major city, and Germany, where the sport has around 45,000 registered amateur players.\nIn Brazil, football is a growing sport. It was generally unknown there until the 1980s when a small group of players began playing on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The sport grew gradually with 700 amateur players registering within 20 years. Games were played on the beach with modified rules and without the traditional football equipment due to its lack of availability in Brazil. Eventually, a tournament, the Carioca championship, was founded, with the championship Carioca Bowl played to determine a league champion. The country saw its first full-pad game of football in October 2008. According to \"The Rio Times\", the sport is one of the fastest-growing sports in Brazil and is almost as commonly played as soccer on the beaches of Copacabana and Botafogo.\nFootball in Brazil is governed by the Confederação Brasileira de Futebol Americano (CBFA), which had over 5,000 registered players as of November 2013. The sport's increase in popularity has been attributed to games aired on ESPN, which began airing in Brazil in 1992 with Portuguese commentary. The popularity and \"easy accessibility\" of non-contact versions of the sport in Brazil has led to a rise in participation by female players. According to ESPN, the American football audience in Brazil increased 800% between 2013 and 2016. The network, along with Esporte Interativo, airs games there on cable television. Football is often associated in Brazil as being the sport of supermodel Gisele Bündchen's ex-husband Tom Brady. The NFL has expressed interest in having games in the country, and the Super Bowl has become a widely watched event in Brazil at bars and movie theaters.\nFurther countries have also expressed interest in football to lesser degrees. The Arab world has expressed growing interest in American football, with many countries in the region being members of IFAF Asia. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which are not members of IFAF, have established their own domestic leagues. Egypt established two leagues for the sport, namely the Egyptian League of American Football and the Egyptian Federation of American Football, and Saudi Arabia hosts two teams based out of Jeddah and Yanbu respectively. China has additionally been a target for the expansion of the sport, with the Mainland being the home of the Chinese National Football League as well as a growing audience of Super Bowl watchers. Three franchises are also based out of Hong Kong, which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic regularly played mainland teams. NFL games average 900,000 viewers in China, though the league has cited logistical challenges which would prevent teams from playing games akin to abroad games in European countries.\nVariations and related sports.\nCanadian football, the predominant form of football in Canada, is closely related to American football—both sports developed from rugby and are considered to be the chief variants of gridiron football. Although both games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures , including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards), teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone. The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind the National Hockey League. The NFL and CFL had a formal working relationship from 1997 to 2006. The CFL has a strategic partnership with two American football leagues, the German Football League (GFL) and the Liga de Futbol Americano Profesional (LFA). The Canadian rules were developed separately from the American game.\nIndoor football leagues constitute what \"The New York Times\" writer Mike Tanier described as the \"most minor of minor leagues.\" Leagues are unstable, with franchises regularly moving from one league to another or merging with other teams, and teams or entire leagues dissolving completely; games are only attended by a small number of fans, and most players are semi-professional athletes. The Indoor Football League is an example of a prominent indoor league. The Arena Football League, which was founded in 1987 and ceased operations in 2019, was one of the longest-lived indoor football leagues. In 2004, the league was called \"America's fifth major sport\" by \"ESPN The Magazine\".\nThere are several non-contact variants of football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim to pull a flag tied around the ballcarrier's waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. Depending on the rules used, a game of touch football may require the ballcarrier be touched with either one or two hands to be considered downed."

        "text": "Héctor Olivera Amaro (born April 5, 1985) is a Cuban former professional baseball left fielder. He was part of the Cuban team that won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves.\nCareer.\nCuban career.\nOlivera played for the Santiago de Cuba team in the Cuban National Series from 2003 through 2014 and hit .323 with 96 home runs and 433 runs batted in for them. He missed the entire 2012–13 season due to a blood disorder, which also limited him defensively during the 2013–14 season.\nIn addition, he played for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 2007 and 2009 Baseball World Cups, the 2010 Intercontinental Cup, the 2011 Pan American Games and the 2009 World Baseball Classic.\nDefection from Cuba.\nOlivera defected from Cuba in September 2014 to pursue a career in Major League Baseball, establishing his residence in Haiti. His potential drew many scouts to his showcase in the Dominican Republic, where he was said to be in good physical condition with a quick bat and above-average power.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn March 24, 2015, he agreed to sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers for six years and $62.5 million, including a $28 million signing bonus. His contract also reportedly included a clause that would allow the Dodgers to add on a seventh year for $1 million if Olivera required Tommy John surgery. This clause was the result of several MRIs that showed Olivera had a minor UCL tear.\nOlivera worked out at the Dodgers training facility in the Dominican Republic while waiting for his visa to travel to the United States to be approved, which finally happened on May 11, 2015. He passed his physical on May 19 and officially signed his contract. The physical also revealed that, contrary to previous reports, he did not need elbow surgery. The team announced that Olivera would spend several weeks at their spring training facility in Arizona before joining a minor league team. On June 3, he was assigned to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League to begin his professional baseball career. He made his debut with the Drillers the next day and had one hit in four at-bats with two walks in a game against the Midland RockHounds. This was his first game action since the 2013-14 Cuban season and manager Razor Shines said, \"For a guy that hasn't played in that long, his at-bats were really good.\" In six games for the Drillers, Olivera batted .318 and hit a grand slam. He was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers on June 12. His advancement was hampered by a hamstring injury on June 20.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn July 30, 2015, in a three-team trade, the Atlanta Braves acquired Olivera, Paco Rodriguez, minor-league pitcher Zachary Bird and a competitive balance draft pick for the 2016 MLB Draft, while the Dodgers acquired Mat Latos, Michael Morse, Bronson Arroyo, Alex Wood, Jim Johnson, Luis Avilán and José Peraza, and the Miami Marlins acquired minor-league pitchers Victor Araujo, Jeff Brigham and Kevin Guzman. He was called up to the majors for the first time on September 1, 2015. Six days later, Olivera hit his first major league home run in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. In the off-season, Olivera played in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente based in Puerto Rico, where he began a transition to left field. The Braves continued starting Olivera in left field during spring training.\nOn April 13, 2016, Olivera was arrested outside Washington, D.C., after a domestic dispute. Although convicted of misdemeanor assault and battery and sentenced to a 90-day prison term, he was released after serving 10 days. He was subsequently placed on the MLB restricted list, and in his absence, the Braves recalled Daniel Castro from Triple-A Gwinnett as an infielder replacement.\nOn May 26, 2016, Olivera was ultimately suspended for 82 games without pay for violating MLB's off-the-field personal conduct policy that consists of domestic violence and other known violations, meaning that Olivera would not be eligible to play until August 1. The suspension applied retroactively on April 30, and Olivera decided not to appeal it.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn July 30, 2016, the Braves traded Olivera to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Matt Kemp and cash considerations. Upon the completion of his MLB suspension, the Padres designated Olivera for assignment on August 2. On August 9, 2016, Olivera was released.\nSugar Land Skeeters.\nOn May 30, 2017, Olivera signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. On November 1, 2017, he became a free agent and retired from professional baseball at age 32."

        "text": "John Michael \"Jack\" Daugherty (born July 3, 1960) is a former major league first baseman and outfielder for parts of seven seasons with the Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds and Montreal Expos.\nCareer.\nAmateur career.\nDaugherty played high school baseball at Kearny High School, in San Diego, California. At the collegiate level he played for the University of Arizona, and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Oakland Athletics on October 9, .\nMinors &amp; Independent League.\nDaugherty was released by the A's in January after only one season in their farm system. He played the 1984 season for the independent Helena Gold Sox of the Pioneer Baseball League before signing with the Montreal Expos in December.\nMontreal Expos.\nDaugherty made his major league debut in as a first baseman with the Montreal Expos. He was 1 for 10 in 11 games with his only hit coming against Greg Maddux. After spending the entire season in the minors, batting .285 for the Indianapolis Indians, he was sent to the Texas Rangers to complete an earlier deal in which the Rangers sent Tom O'Malley to the Expos for a player to be named later.\nTexas Rangers.\nIn he was used as a pinch hitter, back-up first baseman, left fielder and occasional designated hitter for the 4th place Rangers. He posted solid hitting numbers, with a .302 average, .364 on-base percentage, and .406 slugging percentage, over 58 games.\nDaugherty's best season was , as he appeared in a career high 125 games, hit six home runs, drove in 47, and batted .300/.347/.435. He was the first Ranger to hit over .300 with 100 or more at-bats in back to back seasons since Al Oliver accomplished the feat in -.\nThe best game of Daugherty's career came on Sunday, July 8, 1990, when he was 4 for 5 with two home runs and three RBIs. In fact, Daugherty hit 20% of his career home runs in that game and did so in back to back at-bats against pitchers Roger Clemens and Jeff Reardon. The home run against Clemens occurred in the 7th inning and the blast off of Reardon came in the bottom of the 9th to tie the game. The Rangers would go on to defeat the first placed Red Sox in 11 innings.\nInjuries limited Daugherty's season to only 58 games, for which he posted lackluster statistics of .194/.270/.264. Given a reprieve in , Daugherty nearly duplicated his '91 effort by hitting .205/.295/.276 over 59 games. The Rangers subsequently released him following the 1992 season.\nHouston Astros and Cincinnati Reds.\nDaugherty signed with the Houston Astros as a free agent on January 5, . Assigned to the Astros' triple A affiliate the Tucson Toros, Daugherty responded by tearing up the Pacific Coast League by hitting .390/.488/.525 over 42 games. Despite these numbers, he found little playing time with the parent club, as perennial all-star Jeff Bagwell occupied first base and manager Art Howe seemed to prefer using Kevin Bass, Chris Donnels and Chris James as his primary pinch-hitters. Daugherty was 1 for 3 in just four games with Houston. His lone Astros hit came as a pinch-hitter against Bob Tewksbury of the St. Louis Cardinals in a 6-1 Astros loss at Busch Memorial Stadium on May 4, 1993. The Astros later traded Daugherty to the Cincinnati Reds on July 12, 1993, for Steve Carter. With Cincinnati, he played in 46 games while hitting .220/.338/.356.\nChiba Lotte Marines.\nIn January , Daugherty signed with the Colorado Rockies, but did not make the major league roster that Spring. After two seasons in the Toronto Blue Jays' and San Francisco Giants' farm systems, Daugherty played in for the Chiba Lotte Marines. He played in 19 games, batting .119, before being released in June."

Phil Taylor was defending his Whyte &amp; Mackay Premier League title once again, however he failed to retain it after losing to Mervyn King 10–6 in the semi-finals.

This meant that Mervyn King and James Wade each played twice during week eleven, with Mardle now due to play five matches in the last three weeks. Mardle had been due to play two matches in both weeks thirteen and fourteen, which would give King the night off in Sheffield, and Wade the night off in Cardiff.

He graduated from Gove High School and Kansas State University.\nProfessional playing career.\nRandall was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in three separate drafts: 1966, 1968, and finally the 2nd round in 1969, after which he signed. For the next five and a half years, he played 744 games in the Dodgers' farm system and batted over .300 four times, but was never promoted to the major league level. Then, on December 23, 1975, he got his first break when he was traded to the Twins in exchange for reserve outfielder Danny Walton.\nRandall's second, perhaps more important, break was Minnesota manager Gene Mauch's decision to move future Hall of Famer Rod Carew to first base, opening up second base for Randall, who beat out Jerry Terrell for the job in spring training. Randall capitalized on the opportunity, batting .267 in 153 games in 1976 while finishing fourth in the American League in sacrifice hits.\nThat turned out to be the high mark of Randall's career. He spent the next two seasons splitting time at second base with Rob Wilfong, losing the starting job to the lefty-hitting Wilfong entirely in 1979. The following spring, he was released by the Twins and briefly served as a coach, then was restored to the active playing roster in May.

In high school, he was one of the most highly decorated basketball players in the United States. In college, he achieved success after transferring from University of Michigan to University of Missouri, but his success did not lead him to the National Basketball Association (henceforth NBA). Instead, he went to the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and has since played in various developmental and foreign basketball leagues as a professional.\nIn high school, he was a \"Street &amp; Smith\", Parade, and McDonald's All-American and in college he became a first team All-Big 12 Conference player and CNN/Sports Illustrated Big 12 Player of the Year. White was implicated in the University of Michigan basketball scandal, but was not named in the final indictments. He transferred from Michigan to Missouri after his freshman year, which included the basketball scandal, for unrelated reasons. He achieved several firsts for Missouri and led the team to their best season in the Big 12 era in 1998–99.\nHe declared himself eligible for the 1999 NBA draft as a redshirt junior and went undrafted. He was drafted in the 1999 CBA draft. He has had multiple stints in the CBA, United States Basketball League (USBL), International Basketball League (IBL) and various foreign leagues. As a professional, he once was named to the All-CBA second team. He was selected as an All-star or All-league player and been part of championship teams in several of the professional leagues he played in.\nHigh school.\nborn June 13, 1977, White went to high school at Metro Detroit's Inkster High School, where he played basketball. While at Inkster, he placed third in the 1995 Mr. Basketball of Michigan voting, which was won by Robert Traylor. He was named a Parade All-American as a junior according to the Detroit Public School League records, and according to CNN/SI he was honored by Parade as a senior. Prior to his senior season, he was named a \"Street &amp; Smith\" All-American. As a senior, he was named a McDonald's All-American. He was also named \"Detroit News/Detroit Free Press\" first-team (known as Dream Team) All-State for both his junior and senior seasons. He was part of one of the most star-studded McDonald's All-American classes with future NBA All-stars Vince Carter, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Antawn Jamison, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Chauncey Billups. During the tenth anniversary of his \"Street &amp; Smith\" 1994–95 High School All-America Team, eight of the twenty members were still playing in the NBA.\nCollege.\nWhite was implicated in early investigations of the University of Michigan basketball scandal because he accepted US$37,000. He was not named in later indictments and was not named as having been called before the grand jury. It was not clear how much money White received and how much was given to his friends and family to influence his decision to attend Michigan. Although White was one of several players captured on federal wiretaps and interviewed by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service, he cooperated fully and did not need to hire a lawyer. He was not among the players called before the grand jury (Robert Traylor, Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock) and was not found to have received large amounts of money.\nWhite transferred to the Missouri Tigers men's basketball team due to a clash with Steve Fisher after his freshman year with the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. White left the team for what was described as disciplinary reasons. White, who averaged 9.0 points and 4.7 rebounds, had been one of the most improved players during the previous season. He averaged eleven points and seven rebounds during the final seven Big Ten Conference games. Nonetheless, he was suspended for the first semester in October 1996 for violating a team rule.\nWhite played for the 1995–96 Michigan Wolverines team that went to the 1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as a seventh seed, but lost 80–76 in the first round to the Texas Longhorns men's basketball team. He returned to the 1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as an eighth seed with Missouri, but lost 61–59 in the first round to the New Mexico Lobos men's basketball team. However, as a result of the basketball scandal, Michigan has vacated all games from the 1995–96 season. As of 2008, the second place Big 12 finish that season is the only top four placing for the Tigers since the formation of the Big 12 conference during the 1996–97 season.\nDuring the 1998–99 season he became the first Missouri Tigers player to lead the team in scoring, rebounds and assists in the same season, and he placed in the top five in the Big 12 in both scoring and rebounding. That season he helped the Missouri Tigers snap the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team's 35 game home conference winning streak which had extended from February 20, 1994, to January 1999. That season he was twice named Big 12 men's basketball player of the week and made the official All-Big 12 first team. CNN/Sports Illustrated named White the Player of the Year in the Big 12. However, he lost the official conference player of the year award to Venson Hamilton, and he was only listed as a second team All-Big 12 player by the Associated Press.\nAfter his redshirt junior season, he declared himself eligible for the 1999 NBA draft with one year of collegiate eligibility remaining, making him the first Missouri Tiger to declare early for the NBA draft. Although some speculated that he was making a mistake declaring early for the draft, he had the burden of child support and some projected him as a likely draft selection. White went undrafted in the NBA draft after surrendering his final year of eligibility. However, that year some other early draft entrants met with better success: the first four selections (Elton Brand, Steve Francis, Baron Davis, and Lamar Odom) also had surrendered some remaining collegiate eligibility by declaring themselves eligible to be drafted in the NBA draft and high schoolers Jonathan Bender and Leon Smith were drafted in the first round. Many other underclassmen in his draft year such as Ron Artest, Richard Hamilton, and Corey Maggette have gone on to have successful NBA careers.\nProfessional career.\nWhite was drafted in the 1999 CBA draft by the Sioux Falls Skyforce. During the first year, he was a CBA All-rookie selection. He spent the 1999–2000 and some of the 2000–01 season with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He also spent some of 2000–01 and 2001–02 with the Florida Sea Dragons of the USBL. During the 2001–02 he spent part of the year with the USBL's Oklahoma Storm and the Brighton Bears of the British Basketball League (BBL). During the 2002–03 regular season as a member of the Rockford Lightning, he finished fourth in the CBA in scoring and seventh in offensive rebounds. That season he was named to the All-CBA second team. During the 2003–04 season he played for the Incheon ET Land Black Slamer of the Korean Basketball League (KBL). During 2005, he played with the Detroit Pros of the IBL. During the 2007–08 season he led the Pittsburgh Xplosion to the playoffs. In 33 regular season games he averaged 12.6 points and 4.8 rebounds for the 18–15 team. He has also played in the National Superior Basketball of Puerto Rico, Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (LPB) of Venezuela and in various leagues in Italy. Over the course of his professional career he was selected as an All-star or All-league player in the CBA, BBL, KBL and IBL. He has been part of Championship teams in the USBL in 2002, CBA in 2003 and LPB in 2007.\nOn October 21, 2011, it was announced that White had made the final twelve-man roster for the National Basketball League of Canada's London Lightning. He has since been placed on the inactive reserve list."

        "text": "The Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium is a baseball stadium located inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Manila, Philippines. It has a seating capacity of 10,000.\nHistory.\n1934 Far Eastern Championship Games.\nThe Far Eastern Championship Games (also known as Far East Games) was a small Asian multi-sport competition considered to be a precursor to the Asian Games. In 1912, E.S. Brown, president of the Philippine Athletic Association and Manila Carnival Games, proposed the creation of the \"Far Eastern Olympic Games\" to China and Japan. It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association. \nThe first Far Eastern Championship Games was held in the Manila Carnival Grounds in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913. Forbes was also the one who formally declared the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: The Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong. The Philippines also hosted the games in 1925 and 1934.\nThe Manila Carnival Grounds was redeveloped into the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in 1934, named in honor of the country's national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, before the 10th Far Eastern Games. Baseball was a main event in every Far Eastern Games and in that year, the games were played at the new Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium. Legendary American New York Yankees players Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth hit the first and second home runs, respectively on December 2, 1934. The game that saw the participation of an all-star team, which included Gehrig, Ruth and Philadelphia Athletics MVP Jimmie Foxx, was one of the highlights of the stadium’s history. The record is etched on the walls of the baseball stadium.\nWorld War II.\nIn February 1945, the Japanese forces built a defensive stronghold in their retreat against the advancing American infantry. The stronghold was built in the Harrison area, which included De La Salle University and the Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium. The 1st Cavalry Division of the Americans defeated the Japanese by utilizing three tanks, demolitions, and flamethrowers. The Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium suffered devastation due to the war.\nBy April 1945, Garrisoned American &amp; Filipino soldiers under the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army &amp; Philippine Constabulary were playing baseball before thousands of spectators at the ruins of the stadium after the liberation. The stadium was repaired with the floodlights of the then newly renovated stadium first opened by January 1946.\n1954 Asian Baseball Championship.\nThe stadium was the venue of the 1954 Asian Baseball Championship. The year 1954 is considered as the beginning of the golden era in Philippine baseball history as the Philippines won first place in the Asian Baseball Championships. The Philippines was the inaugural champions of the Asian Baseball Championships in 1954 but finished fourth in seven of the next eight editions of the biennial events. \nArchitecture.\nThe Rizal Memorial Stadium is considered to be an Art Deco architectural design that incorporated streamlines and simpler lines, flat surfaces and rounded edges. The design represented stability and modernity.\nThe complex, built under the supervision of architect Juan Arellano, started construction in 1927."

The two teams have played 37 test matches, with New Zealand winning 31, Ireland winning 5, and 1 match drawn. \nDuring the 2012 Irish Tour of New Zealand, New Zealand won all three tests, scoring 124 points to Ireland's 29. This tour also saw New Zealand post the biggest winning margin against Ireland in their history, with a score of 60–0 on 23 June 2012. \nOn 24 November 2013, New Zealand were trailing 22–17 against Ireland in the final minute of the match, and on the verge of their first ever loss to Ireland. Ireland gave up a penalty with under 30 seconds remaining, which ultimately led to New Zealand working their way up the field, ending in a try to tie the score. The try was converted at the second attempt, fiving New Zealand the victory and their perfect season. \nDespite New Zealand's dominance until 2016, the ten matches between 2013 and 2023 were shared five each in tightly contested matches between teams at the top of the world rankings. Ireland ended a 111-year wait for a victory at Soldier Field in Chicago with a 40–29 win on 5 November 2016. On 17 November 2018, Ireland won 16–9 at the Aviva Stadium, Dublin, their first home win against the New Zealand. Ireland scored their first victory against the All Blacks in New Zealand on 9 July 2022. The following week Ireland became just the fifth touring side to achieve a series win in New Zealand, winning 22–32 in Wellington for a 2-1 series victory, and consecutive victories against New Zealand for the first time. The most recent meeting between the teams saw New Zealand beat Ireland 28-24 in the quarter-final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup."

The first Test match between the two sides was played in 1905 at Cardiff Arms Park, with Wales winning 3–0, when the All Blacks were in Wales during the historic 1905–1906 All Blacks tour in Europe and North America. The loss was said to be controversial, as All Blacks wing Bob Deans claimed to have scored a try that would have brought them level. However, Wales were generally considered the better team with the All Blacks playing particularly poorly in the first half of the game. Two more Welsh victories in the next 50 years were balanced by a defeat by the 1924 All Black \"Invincibles\". Since the last loss (19 December 1953) New Zealand have won 33 consecutive encounters and Wales winning 0. Wales also played the touring New Zealand Natives team at St Helens on 22 December 1888 defeating them by 1 Goal to nil and the New Zealand Services at Cardiff on 21 April 1919, with Wales losing 6–3. Wales has accorded both of these matches 'test' status but neither game is considered to be an official test by New Zealand. Wales has also played the New Zealand Maori in Cardiff on 13 November 1982 defeating them 25–19. Neither country accorded that game test status."

        "text": "David Paul Montgomery (June 26, 1946 – May 8, 2019) was an American businessman and baseball executive. He served as chairman, minority-owner, and president of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball.\nEarly life and education.\nAs a child growing up in Philadelphia, Montgomery attended Philadelphia Phillies games at Connie Mack Stadium. Before attending college, Montgomery worked as a paper delivery boy and a high school baseball coach. Montgomery was a 1964 alumnus of the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia and as an undergraduate attended the University of Pennsylvania where he was first a liberal arts major, and then a history major. Montgomery was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while an undergraduate. Montgomery continued to attend Phillies games as a college student with future governor Ed Rendell, where he recalled \"[trying] to eat all the food that $5 could buy... as they shared their thoughts with the players\". He also attended the Wharton Business School as a graduate student, graduating in 1970. During his tenure at Wharton, he also coached the linemen for the varsity football team at Germantown Academy.\nBaseball career.\nAfter interviewing for positions with the Scott Paper Company and Quaker Oats and being encouraged by Rendell to apply for a job with the Philadelphia 76ers, Montgomery reached out to former Phillies ace Robin Roberts, whose son he coached at Germantown, about a job with the baseball club. Montgomery was hired as a member of the Phillies' sales department in 1971, becoming director of sales and marketing in the mid-1970s and the head of the business department by 1980. During the early 1970s, he was also the team's scoreboard operator.\nMontgomery, along with co-owner Bill Giles, purchased the team in 1981 for $30 million ($ today); Giles, the primary owner, named Montgomery the executive vice president of the team. In 1997, when Giles left the team presidency to become the chairman and focus on negotiating for a new stadium for the team, he recommended Montgomery to replace him as team president. In so doing, Montgomery became the first native of Philadelphia to run the club in over 60 years. One of his focuses with the team was brand development, evidenced by the team's commitment to signing successful players to long-term contracts prior to the opening of Citizens Bank Park in 2004.\nIn August 2014, Montgomery took a leave of absence from the Phillies, while undergoing treatment for jaw bone cancer. When he returned to the team in January 2015, he assumed the title of chairman, while Giles became chairman emeritus. Pat Gillick, who served as interim president during Montgomery's leave, assumed the role permanently.\nIn 2013, the Phillies opened a $4 million facility at their Carpenter Complex as the first indoor climate-controlled training center at a major-league spring-training site. It is used by the team year-round in Clearwater for training, rehabilitation, and daily workouts. On March 22, 2018, the Phillies renamed the indoor facility at the complex the \"David P. Montgomery Baseball Performance Center.\"\nAwards and honors.\nMontgomery received the Allan H. (Bud) Selig Executive Leadership Award from the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation, the Ed Snider Lifetime Distinguished Humanitarian Award from the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association, and has been recognized by the Mural Arts Program, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Philadelphia and the . Daisy Field, where he grew up playing baseball, was re-named for him in 2018, and in May 2019, he was honored by the Fairmount Park Conservancy as the recipient of the Centennial Award for Civic Leadership.\nOn March 5, 2020, Montgomery was named the fifth winner of the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Commissioner Rob Manfred and Montgomery's wife Lyn spoke on his behalf.\nOutside baseball.\nMontgomery was a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, served community action organizations, and was a member of Major League Baseball Enterprise's board of directors.\nPersonal life.\nMontgomery and his wife Lyn had three children and three grandchildren. Montgomery was diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone in May 2014, and underwent surgery that same year. He died from the disease on the morning of May 8, 2019, at the age of 72."

        "text": "Jason Michael Castro (born June 18, 1987) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Angels, and San Diego Padres. After playing college baseball at Stanford University, he was selected by the Astros in the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft (#10 overall). Castro made his big league debut with Houston in 2010. He was selected to the 2013 All-Star Game, serving as a reserve catcher, which made him the first Astro All-Star elected to play for the American League.\nEarly life.\nCastro was born in Castro Valley, California, and played high school baseball at Castro Valley High School. He played junior varsity basketball at Castro Valley High School for the legendary Coach Burns.\nCollege career.\nCastro attended Stanford University, where he played college baseball for the Stanford Cardinal. He was named the club's most valuable player his junior year. After his sophomore season in 2007, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he batted .341 in 39 games, was named the starting catcher for the East Division All-Star team, and helped lead the Red Sox to the league championship.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nCastro was selected by the Astros in the first round (tenth overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Castro started in Single-A for the Tri-City ValleyCats in 2008. He was promoted to play for the Class AA Corpus Christi Hooks on June 7, 2009, after playing in Advanced-A for the Lancaster JetHawks and played his first game for the team on June 10. He also played for the United States national team in the 2009 Baseball World Cup in Nettuno, Italy.\nCastro was selected to play for the United States team in the 2009 All-Star Futures Game in St. Louis. In the game, he threw out a runner and hit a three-run home run. He was ranked 53rd on Baseball America's list of \"Top 100 Prospects\" in 2009. Shortly after the Futures Game, the Astros sent Castro home early from the Arizona Fall League so that he could rest for the 2010 season.\nHouston Astros (2010, 2012–2016).\nOn June 20, 2010, the Astros promoted Castro to the MLB from the Class AAA Round Rock Express. He made his MLB debut on June 22, 2010, at Minute Maid Park against the San Francisco Giants. He singled off Tim Lincecum in his first career at-bat. Castro hit his first major league home run on June 24, 2010, against Matt Cain.\nOn March 2, 2011, while playing in a spring training game against the Detroit Tigers, Castro suffered a knee injury while running to first base. He underwent surgery two days later, on March 4, to repair his torn anterior cruciate ligament and a damaged meniscus. As a result, he missed the entire 2011 season.\nOn June 13, 2012, while pinch-hitting for Xavier Cedeño, Castro grounded out to Joaquin Arias to record the last out for Matt Cain's perfect game. He played 87 games in the 2012 season, finishing the year with a .257 batting average, 6 home runs and 29 RBI.\nOn May 20, 2013, Castro was awarded the honor of being American League Player of the Week. He earned his first All-Star Game selection that season as a reserve catcher, but did not appear in the game. He led the Astros with a .350 OBP. He set club catcher records with 63 runs, 18 home runs (16 of which were hit as a catcher, tying John Bateman's club record — two were while playing as a DH), and a .485 slugging percentage. In September, he had surgery to remove a cyst from his knee and missed the rest of the season. He played 120 games that year.\nAfter the 2013 season, Castro completed the degree that he had started at Stanford. When he was drafted, he was 25 credits shy of the degree. He had returned to Stanford in the 2010 offseason to begin taking the rest of the courses, but he was delayed by rehabilitation from his 2011 injury.\nBefore the 2014 season, Castro signed a one-year contract with the Astros worth $2.45 million. Before the 2015 season, he signed another one-year contract with the Astros, worth $4 million. In 2015, he batted .211.\nIn 2016, he batted .210.\nMinnesota Twins (2017–2019).\nOn November 30, 2016, Castro signed a three-year contract worth $24.5 million with the Minnesota Twins. In his first season with the Twins, Castro hit .242 with 10 home runs and 47 RBIs in 110 games.\nOn May 16, 2018, it was revealed that Castro was diagnosed with a torn meniscus in his right knee, which required season-ending surgery. In 2018 he batted .143.\nIn 2019, Castro played in only 79 games for the Twins due to sharing time with Mitch Garver, who had a breakout year.

With the Angels, he batted .192.\nSan Diego Padres (2020).\nOn August 30, 2020, the Angels traded Castro to the San Diego Padres for Gerardo Reyes. In 27 games split between the Angels and Padres, Castro batted .188/.293/.375 with two home runs and 9 RBI in 80 at-bats.\nReturn to Houston (2021–2022).\nOn January 22, 2021, Castro signed a 2-year, $7 million contract to return to Houston.\nIn the 2021 regular season, he batted .235, and .180 against left-handlers. On defense, he caught stealing 13% of runners, catching 4 runners while yielding 27 stolen bases.\nIn Game 2 (October 16) of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) versus the Boston Red Sox, he hit a home run in a 9–5 loss. It was his first and only postseason home run. On October 19, in Game 4 at Fenway Park, Castro played a key part in the series. With two out in a 2–2 tie, pinch-hitting for Martin Maldonado, he singled home Carlos Correa in the top of the ninth inning off Nathan Eovaldi to drive Correa home. The run was the first of seven that the Astros scored in the inning, with the Astros going on to win 9–2, tying the series at 2–2 after the Red Sox had won two in a row. Two games later, the Astros won the pennant to send Castro (who went 2-for-3 in the ALCS) to his first World Series. Prior to Game 4 of the 2021 World Series, Castro was removed from the Astros roster due to COVID-19 protocols, and he was replaced for the rest of the series by Garrett Stubbs.\nOn June 29, 2022, Castro, along with ace Justin Verlander, helped lead a 2–0 shutout of the New York Mets. Castro's two-run home run supplied all the offense in the game while tripling his RBI season total from one to three. On July 1, 2022, the Astros placed Castro on the 10-day injured list due to left knee discomfort. On August 2, the Astros announced that Castro underwent surgery on the left knee and would miss the remainder of the season. This made his home run his last at-bat. Due to injury, Castro was unable to make an appearance for the Astros in the 2022 postseason but still earned his first career championship ring as the Astros went on to win the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.\nRetirement.\nOn December 2, 2022, Castro announced on Twitter that he was retiring from Major League Baseball.\nUpon his retirement, Castro ranked as the Astros' career leader among catchers in home runs (71), and his 717 games at the position ranked third behind Alan Ashby and Brad Ausmus.\nPersonal life.\nCastro married Maris Perlman in late 2012. They met at Stanford, where Perlman played lacrosse. The couple founded Castro's Kids, a Houston-area literacy program. The couple has three children, 2 boys and 1 girl."

        "text": "Keith Jarrett (born 18 May 1948) is a Welsh former dual-code international rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s. He played representative rugby union for the British Lions and for Wales, where he set point scoring records, and Monmouthshire, and at club level for Abertillery RFC, Newport RFC and London Welsh RFC, as a centre, i.e. number 12 or 13. The teenaged Jarrett made a memorable international debut for Wales against England in 1967, scoring 19 of Wales's 34 points. He also played representative rugby league for Wales, and at club level for Barrow. \nEarly career.\nJarrett was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, the son of former Glamorgan cricketer Hal Jarrett, and attended Monmouth School. Like his father, he played cricket for Glamorgan County Cricket Club. In 1966 Keith Jarrett he played his first official rugby union match for Newport against Ebbw Vale, shortly after leaving school.\nCricket.\nJarrett played for Glamorgan Second XI from 1965 to 1967, appearing in two first-class matches in 1967 – one each against the Indian and Pakistani tourists. He was a middle order bat and change right arm seam bowler.\nInternational rugby career.\nJarrett played his first international for Wales on 15 April 1967 against England, aged eighteen years. He had been selected at full back even though he had never played senior rugby in that position. Newport were asked to play him at full back against Newbridge on the weekend before the international to give him some experience. He did not seem to be much of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. Instead, Jarrett took the ball without breaking his stride, and outflanked the astonished England defence to score in the left corner. He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points, equalling a Welsh record. His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of \"Rugby World\" magazine two months later. The try has been highly-ranked in several popular polls to select the greatest Welsh tries.\nIn 1968 he set a club record of 30 points for Newport against Penarth, and was selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa.\nJarrett played for Wales at rugby union ten times in all, making his final appearance against Australia on 21 June 1969 during the Wales tour of New Zealand and Australia.\nLater career.\nOn his return from tour in 1969, Jarrett joined rugby league club Barrow for a signing-on fee of £14,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £380,000 in 2016). He was also selected for the Welsh national rugby league side, before he had played his first match for Barrow. He was later transferred to Wigan, although he did not play for them.\nJarrett's rugby career was cut short in 1973, aged just 25, when he suffered a stroke resulting from a haemorrhage."

        "text": "The 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from February 12 to February 28. A total of 2,632 athletes (+124 from 2006 Olympics) representing 82 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+2 from 2006) participated in 86 events (+2 from 2006) from 15 different sports and disciplines (unchanged from 2006).\nAthletes from 26 NOCs won at least one medal, and athletes from 19 of these NOCs secured at least one gold. For the first time, Canada won a gold medal at an Olympic Games it hosted, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. In contrast to the lack of gold medals at these previous Olympics, the Canadian team finished first overall in gold medal wins, and became the first host nation—since Norway in 1952—to lead the gold medal count, with 14 medals. In doing so, it also broke the record for the most gold medals won by a NOC at a single Winter Olympics (the previous was 13, set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and matched by Norway in 2002). The United States placed first in total medals—its second time doing so in a Winter Games—and set a new record for most medals won by a NOC at a single Winter Olympics, with 37 (the previous record was 36, established by Germany in 2002). Athletes from Slovakia and Belarus won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.\nCross-country skier Marit Bjørgen from Norway won five medals (three gold, one silver, one bronze), more than any other athlete. Chinese short track speed skater Wang Meng tied Bjørgen for the lead in gold medals, with three.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.\nIn the men's individual biathlon competition, two silver medals were awarded for a second-place tie, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event."

        "text": "Roy Bell (born 30 August 1984) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played as a er for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL between 2004 and 2005.\nBackground.\nBell was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nCareer.\nBell made his first grade debut for South Sydney in round 23 2004 against North Queensland at the Willows Sports Complex. Bell scored a try in a 22–36 loss.\nBell's final game in the top grade came during the 2005 NRL season against St. George Illawarra in round 15 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nDespite scoring 7 tries in only 9 games, Bell departed South Sydney at the age of only 20. He was released from his South Sydney contract and returned to the North Coast of New South Wales in 2005 after not adjusting to life in Sydney and becoming homesick.\nIn this time Bell developed a cult following among rugby league fans because of his tiny frame and his skinny (even relative to his body) legs. At 65 kg, Bell was even smaller than Preston Campbell (74 kg), another Aboriginal player famed for his slight frame. His ability to tackle players twice his size was seen as a throwback to the days of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons.\nAfter departing from Souths, Bell continued to play rugby league in the local North Coast competition for Casino and Northern United. He then went on to play for South Grafton and won a group 2 premiership with them in 2015.\nControversy.\nIn 2005, Bell was stood down by South Sydney after being convicted of drink driving. South Sydney CEO Shane Richardson spoke to the media saying \"Roy is a fine young player but he has made a grave mistake in this instance and we will speak with him and his manager over the weekend about this incident\"."

        "text": "Ganton Golf Club is a golf club in Ganton, North Yorkshire, England. It has an 18-hole golf course that has hosted many major tournaments, including the 1949 Ryder Cup.\nGanton has been widely rated as one of the best golf courses in England and one of the very best in Yorkshire. It has also been rated in the top-100 courses in the world by \"Golf Digest\".\nHistory.\nFounded in 1891 as Scarborough Golf Club, the club's name was changed to Ganton Golf Club in 1907. The course at Ganton was originally designed by Tom Chisholm, assisted by Robert Bird, who became the club's first professional. Since then, modifications to the course have been made by a number of people, including James Braid, J. H. Taylor and Harry Vardon, Harry Colt, Alister MacKenzie, and Tom Simpson.\nVardon was the club's professional between 1896 and 1903; he was succeeded by Ted Ray, who remained at the club until 1912. Percy Adams, who, like Vardon and Ray, was also from Jersey, was the club's professional for a short time, before Arthur Day was appointed in 1913; he remained in post until his death in 1944. His successor was Jock Ballantine, who was appointed in early 1946. In 1950, Bill Branch succeeded Ballantine; he resigned in 1959.\nCompetitions at Ganton.\nThe course has been the venue for a number of notable amateur and professional competitions including the 1949 Ryder Cup, the News of the World Match Play (1953), the Sun Alliance PGA Championship (1981), the 2000 Curtis Cup, the 2003 Walker Cup and The Amateur Championship (1964, 1977, 1991), the English Amateur (1933, 1947, 1955, 1968, 1976, 2016) and the Brabazon Trophy (1952, 1960, 1987, 2006, 2021).\nIn 2017 it hosted the 128th Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge universities."

        "text": "Between July 1927 and March 1928 the New South Wales Waratahs, the top Australian representative rugby union side of the time, conducted a world tour encompassing Ceylon, Britain, France and Canada on which they played five Tests and twenty-six minor tour matches.\nThe Queensland Rugby Union had collapsed in 1919 and would not be reborn until 1929 leaving the New South Wales Rugby Union to administer the game in Australia at the national representative level. Just prior to the start of the Australian 1927 season an invitation from the International Rugby Board arrived in Sydney requesting a New South Wales side tour Great Britain to play Tests against the Home Nations.\nIn 1986 the Australian Rugby Union decreed the five full-internationals played on the tour as official Test matches.\nThe squad and its captain.\nA squad of twenty-nine players was selected comprising twenty-eight New South Welshmen and one Queenslander in the great fly-half Tom Lawton, Snr who had been forced to come to Sydney to continue his career due to the absence of rugby in Brisbane. The side was captained by Arthur Cooper \"Johnnie\" Wallace who from Sydney University had earnt a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford in 1922 and whilst there had represented Scotland in nine Tests between 1923 and 1926.\nThe selection of Wallace as captain is referred to by Howell as \"a masterstoke\". He was well known in Britain through his Oxford and Scotland association, was an experienced and naturally gifted player, a strong tactician and a great influence on the younger players. On the nine-month tour, the Australians won 24, lost 5 and drew 2 of the matches they played and returned having established an international reputation for playing fair and attacking rugby.\nTour itinerary.\nThe squad left Sydney by train on 22 July 1927 bound for Melbourne. They played a game on the afternoon of their arrival in Melbourne against a Victorian invitation XV which was won 19–9. They set off in \"Ormonde\" from Melbourne on 26 July for Adelaide where they had a one-day stop.\nBy 10 August \"Ormonde\" had arrived in Colombo where they were the guests of the Colombo Rugby Union and the tourists played that day against an All Ceylon XV in front of a crowd of 5,000 spectators. They set sail from Ceylon on 11 August. \"Ormonde\" passed through the Suez Canal and the Straits of Messina and a disembarkation was made at Naples to enable a visit to Pompeii. Another stop was made at Toulon before arriving at Gibraltar on 28 August and Plymouth by month's end.\nThe squad had two weeks preparation on land at Teignmouth in Devon before the first tour match against Devon and Cornwall on 17 September. The tourists then relocated to Wales where matches were played at Newport, Swansea and Cardiff.\nAt Oxford the Waratahs suffered their first defeat 0–3 against a varsity side, although they won the next encounter against Cambridge. Matches were also played at Liverpool, Newcastle and Coventry before they sailed to Dublin. The Waratahs won the first Test of the tour 5–3 against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 12 November.\nTwo weeks later the tourists met Wales at Cardiff Arms where they triumphed 18–8. From Cardiff they travelled to Scotland where matches were played at Glasgow, Melrose, Aberdeen and the Test loss at Edinburgh. The tourists made day trips to the Lochs, Lomond, Long and Gyll and where shown over the King's castle at Balmoral. Back in Edinburgh castles were visited by day with dinners and theatre parties attended at night.\nThe party travelled to London for New Year and were shown over the Houses of Parliament by Lord Donoughmore, the Secretary of the House of Lords and James Whitley, the Speaker of the House of Commons. They were presented to the Prince of Wales at St James's Palace and to the King at Sandringham House. At Sandringham they accompanied the King through the woods on a shooting expedition after lunch and were presented to Her Majesty, Queen Mary at afternoon tea.\nLater the Australians were flattered by a personal invitation to take tea at the Piccadilly residence of the Duke and Duchess of York where they met the infant Princess Elizabeth. Three other days were spent in the company of officers of the Army, Air Force and Navy culminating in a tour of the Royal Navy facilities at Portsmouth where they were of shown over the workings of the recently launched Australian submarines and , the museum piece and the royal yacht \"Victoria and Albert\".\nTwo days after the Test loss at Twickenham the squad left for France, spending a night in Paris before journeying to Bordeaux. There against a selected provincial side the Waratahs suffered the most convincing defeat of the tour with the locals taking an early lead and holding on to a 19–10 victory. Then followed a match in Toulouse against a side representing south-western France in which the visitors prevailed.\nBack in Paris, the tourists were entertained and shown the city's splendour before meeting the France national side at Stade Colombes in the final Test match of the tour in front of a crowd of 40,000 with 2,000 gendarmes stationed around the enclosure to keep in check the emotions of the enthusiasts. From Paris the squad crossed the channel and departed from Liverpool in \"Melita\" for Canada. They travelled by train from coast to coast with stops at Montreal, Toronto, Banff and Sicamous. Arriving in Vancouver in late February 1928 the squad spent twelve days and played three exhibition matches against varsity and club sides.\nIn March 1928 they boarded \"Aorangi\" in Vancouver to commence the final leg home with stops in Honolulu, Suva and Auckland before arriving in Sydney by month's end, a full nine months after first setting out.\nMatches of the tour.\nThe \"Exhibition Matches\" are not classed as important as the \"Tour matches\".

        "title": "1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France",
        "text": "Between late 1957 and March 1958 the Australia national rugby union team – the Wallabies – conducted a world tour encompassing Britain, Ireland, France and Canada on which they played five Tests and thirty-one minor tour matches. The Wallabies won 17, lost 16 and drew three of their games in total. They lost all five Tests of the tour.\nThe squad's leadership.\nVersatile back Dick Tooth had made 10 Test appearances for Australia before the tour and had captained the Wallabies well in two 1957 Tests against the All Blacks. Howell expresses a view that it was inexplicable that Tooth was not selected for the tour and partially blames this as cause of the disappointing tour result. However Howell writes that Bob Davidson possessed outstanding qualities to make him a natural touring captain. He was a born leader of men, was immensely popular, he met people well, was highly intelligent and spoke well in public. He played in 32 of the 41 tour games and did everything in his power to make the tour a success.\nVeteran second-rower Alan Cameron had captained the Wallabies in 18 matches in 1955 and 1956 but was no longer supreme in his position nor guaranteed of Test selection. However he made a superb contribution to the tour playing in 22 matches including one Test and captained the side in seven mid-week matches\nAs per tradition, Assistant Manager Dave Cowper assumed the coaching duties. Howell writes that in spite of the mounting losses, Cowper \"ever the gentleman, never criticised the players, even when he had every right to...he personified the true amateur, playing always to the rules with a strict code of ethics\" Squad member Nicholas Shehadie was less complimentary in his published recollections suggesting Cowper had limited imagination as a coach with \"our training devoid of variety which made it very tedious.\"\nTour details.\nThe squad was on tour for eight months in total and travelled to England by ship. Shehadie reports that the team issue consisted of \" \"two blazers, a pair of grey slacks, four green ties with a hand-painted wallaby on each, a heavy pullover and a track suit. In addition, each player received one pair of boots – with another pair to be issued in England – sandshoes for training on the ship, a heavy woollen scarf and tablets to counteract sea-sickness, Vitamin C tablets to counteract colds in Britain and a packet of tranquiliser tablets to be used at the player's own discretion\"\"' He recalls that the squad's pocket money was 10s a day, up from 5s a decade before.\nTest matches.\nIreland.\nShehadie writes in his memoirs that his response to Noel Murphy continually blocking his vision in the scrum was to deal him a punch in an ensuing scrum. He recalls that the Lansdowne Rd crowd booed the Australian team and that press afterwards singled out Shehadie for his brutal play. He suggests that Dave Cowper then determined to make an example of him and true to his word did not select him in another Test of the tour. It was therefore Shehadie's last Test match, as it would also be for Australia's other forward veteran Alan Cameron.\nEngland.\nThis was the day Twickenham booed, a rare sound at the august ground. But when big Jim Lenehan tackled Phil Horrocks-Taylor late and so heavily that he was taken off the field, the crowd were annoyed. Every time Lenehan touched the ball, the crowd booed.\nThe scores were 3–0 at half time, but soon Malcolm Phillips scored a great try and then the elegant Terry Curley gave the Wallabies the lead with a drop goal. When injury time came the score was 6-all. Then came the only try of the match by brilliant Peter Jackson. Jackson out on the wing, got a pass on the Wallaby 25. He was not the fastest of wings – but he was deceptive and knew sidestep, swerve and hand-off, and used them as deadly weapons. He swerved away from Rod Phelps and handed him off. He moved to cut in, plonking Terry Curley onto the wrong foot as he beat him on the outside. Phelps was gaining, the line was approaching, Phelps was faster and Jackson dived with Phelps on his back.\nIt was England's first post-war Test victory over one of the three Southern powers.\nTouring party.\nSquad.\nThe team's most experienced centre three quarter Jim Phipps ( 11 caps prior to tour) played 7 of the first 9 games but broke his leg against Glasgow and Edinburgh and did not play again on tour.\nThe Wallabies played a match in Perth on the way to England during which lock Stewart Scotts broke a wrist and feared he would be left at home. Management decided the six weeks boat trip would give him sufficient time to recover, a decision vindicated by his playing several mid- week games during the tour.\nSources.\nOnline references.\nJackson's try from Planet-Rugby.com"

        "title": "List of dual-code rugby internationals",
        "text": "A dual-code rugby international is a rugby footballer who has played at the senior international level in both codes of rugby, 13-a-side rugby league and 15-a-side rugby union.\nRugby league started as a breakaway version of rugby in Northern England in 1895 and in New Zealand and Australia in 1908, and consequently a number of early top-class rugby league players had been star players in the rugby union code. Accordingly, a high proportion of Australia and New Zealand's dual-code rugby internationals played in rugby league's formative years in those countries.\nFrom 1910 to 1995, dual-code internationals were infrequent and with the single exception of Karl Ifwersen, the player had always first appeared as a union international before shifting to league, due to strict bans applied by administrators in rugby union, which remained amateur, to those players who crossed to the professional code. In 1995 rugby union itself turned professional and the tide of switches began to reverse. Since then the vast majority of cross-code representatives have debuted internationally in league before moving to union where there is now a larger audience and more money available.\nBacks have more often been successful at the highest level of both games than forwards – approximately 65% of the players here listed are backs, although pre-1995 many notable forwards moved from union to league. Since 1995 nearly 90% of the league to union converts who went on to play internationally have been backs.\nThe following is an incomplete list of dual-code internationals, listed by country.\nHong Kong.\nQualifying on residency, New Zealand-born Jack Nielsen became Hong Kong's first dual-code international when the Hong Kong rugby league team played their first ever international match in November 2017.\nNew Zealand.\nThere have been 36 New Zealand dual-code internationals. Only four people became dual-code internationals after first representing New Zealand in rugby league: Karl Ifwersen, Sonny Bill Williams, Matt Duffie and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.\nAll Golds.\nThe 1907 Professional All Blacks (derisively referred to by the New Zealand press as the All Golds) left New Zealand in August 1907 for their ground-breaking tour of Britain via Sydney. The squad contained eight former All Blacks in George Smith, Thomas Cross, William Mackrell, Herbert Turtill, Duncan McGregor, Eric Watkins, Massa Johnston and Edgar Wrigley. These men became New Zealand's first dual-code internationals at the point they first played on the ten-month tour.\nThe three matches in Sydney between 17 and 24 August against professional New South Wales rugby rebels were played under rugby union rules so do not qualify as international rugby league appearances. But full internationals under \"Northern Union\" (rugby league) rules were played against Wales in Aberdare on 1 Januard 1908 and three Tests against Great Britain in Leeds on 25 January 1907, Chelsea on 8 February 1907 and Cheltenham on 15 February 1908. Three Test matches were played in Australia on the homeward leg before the All Golds arrived home in June 1908 having played 48 games (tour matches and Tests) as internationals.\nWales.\nWith 99, Wales have more than twice the number of dual-code rugby internationals than any other country.\nMore than one country.\nDally Messenger\nMessenger played for Australia in rugby union, and for both New Zealand and Australia in rugby league. One week after his final Test appearance as a Wallaby, Messenger, who was born in Australia, toured Great Britain at the invitation of the New Zealand All Golds in 1907. He made his international rugby league debut on that tour representing New Zealand. His Australian international Test debut was made in Sydney in Australia's inaugural rugby league Test v the Kiwis on 9 May 1908. He made six further international rugby league appearances for Australia.\nEmosi Koloto\nKoloto grew up in New Zealand playing rugby union and represented Tonga in the code before switching to league and moving to England. He was called up into the Kiwis in 1991 from the Widnes club and played five tests that year.\nJohn Schuster\nSchuster first played rugby union, representing both Samoa and New Zealand. Later he switched to rugby league and captained Western Samoa in two pool games at the 1995 World Cup.\nHenry Paul\nPaul was born in New Zealand. His senior club rugby league career was played in England but between 1995 and 2001 he regularly returned to New Zealand to make international appearances for the Kiwis. When he switched to union in 2002 he became eligible to represent England by ancestry of his grandfather and he did so in 2002.\nBrad Thorn\nThorn was born in Mosgiel, New Zealand. From age eight he played rugby league in Queensland and aged twenty-two he played for Australia during the Super League split year. When the code reunited in 1998 he also played for Australia.\nIn 2001 he moved to New Zealand and switched to rugby union. He appeared in twelve Tests for New Zealand (the All Blacks) from 2003. For 2005–06 he returned to the National Rugby League in Australia, winning a premiership with the Brisbane Broncos and playing at state level again. In 2008 he switched to rugby union for a second time and was again selected for the All Blacks.\nMichael Horak\nHorak was born in South Africa and represented South Africa in rugby league. He switched to rugby union in 1998 moving to England to play with the Leicester Tigers. He qualifies to represent England via his English mother and did so in 2002.\nLesley Vainikolo\nVainikolo was born in Tonga but raised in New Zealand playing rugby league at school. His league club career was played with the Canberra Raiders in Australia and the Bradford Bulls in England. During that period he made twelve national representative appearances for New Zealand (the Kiwis).\nHe took up rugby union with Gloucester Rugby in 2007. He was eligible to play for Tonga by birth, New Zealand by parentage or England by residence. He had previously declined to play for Tonga in the 2007 Rugby World Cup so that he could play for his adopted nation. He made his international rugby union debut for England v Wales in February 2008 and played in five tests that season.\nCraig Gower\nAfter a successful eleven year Australian rugby league career from 1996 to 2007 with the Penrith Panthers, during which he made five State of Origin appearances for New South Wales and twenty-three Test appearances for Australia (5 for the Super League team and 18 for the ARL team), Gower moved to Europe, switched codes and signed with French rugby union side Bayonne from 2008. He is eligible to play for Italy through his Italian grandfather. He was selected for Italy on their mid-season tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2009.\nShontayne Hape\nHape, a New Zealand Mãori, had a very successful rugby league career in both hemispheres, first with the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL (1999–2002) and then with the Bradford Bulls in the Super League (2003–2008). He made his Test debut for New Zealand in the 2004 Tri-Nations, and eventually appeared in 14 Tests for New Zealand. Hape switched codes in 2008, signing with Bath, for whom he still plays. Under IRB rules, he was already eligible to represent England on residency grounds, having lived there for well over the three years required to qualify. Hape made his union Test debut for England in 2010 against Australia.\nMaurie Fa'asavalu\nMaurie Fa'asavalu is a Samoan rugby union player who formerly played rugby league for St Helens. He was picked in the Great Britain rugby league squad after living in England for 4 years. He also played for England in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup\nBill Hardcastle\nA New Zealander and an 1897 All Black, Hardcastle journeyed to Sydney in 1899 on hearing that the visiting British rugby union team would be not be travelling to New Zealand. Australian rugby in those days had no residential rules and once he joined Sydney's Glebe RU club he qualified for Australian national selection. He was chosen for Australia in the fourth test of 1899 against Great Britain.\nIn rugby league he made two Test appearances for Australia and six minor appearances on the 1908 Kangaroo tour.\nVa'aiga Tuigamala\nTuigamala was nicknamed 'Inga the Winger' and initially represented New Zealand in rugby union. He then switched codes, joining Wigan in 1993. While playing league he represented Western Samoa at the 1995 World Cup. When rugby union turned professional he returned to his original code. Between 1996 and 2000 he represented Samoa in rugby union.\nLote Tuqiri\nBorn in Fiji, Tuqiri was a junior Australian rugby league international at age 19 in 1998. When he missed selection for Australia's 2000 Rugby League World Cup squad he opted to play for Fiji and captained the side in their three pool match appearances. He later played four rugby league Tests for Australia in 2001 before his 2003 switch to union and a long international representative career in that code.\nFred Jackson\nJackson toured Australasia with the 1908 Anglo-Welsh Lions. However, during the tour he was accused of professionalism and recalled to England by the Rugby Football Union. Jackson left the touring party but failed to return to England to face the accusations. In 1910 Jackson played rugby league in New Zealand and represented both Auckland and New Zealand against the touring Great Britain side.\nFirst dual-code rugby international.\nEngland's Anthony Starks and Wales' Jack Rhapps took the field in the inaugural rugby league international of 5 April 1904 between England and Other Nationalities Starks had made two rugby union Test appearances for England in 1896, and Rhapps had made a single rugby union Test appearance for Wales in 1897, and thus in April 1904 they became the world's first dual rugby code internationals.\nThe first tour matches played by the New Zealand All Golds in Britain in Nov &amp; Dec 1907 would have seen international cross-code debuts by some of the seven touring former All Blacks. At this stage of the tour the New Zealanders were still familiarising themselves with the new Northern Union rules which they had not seen until they arrived in Leeds in October. The first full international of the tour against Wales on New Year's Day 1908 saw confirmed appearances by Mackrell, Turtill, Wrigley, Johnston &amp; Cross for New Zealand and David Jones for Wales. Thus New Zealand's first five dual-code rugby internationals all achieved that feat in the same match.\nDual-code internationals who also represented in a third sport.\nMichael Cleary represented Australia in track &amp; field at the Commonwealth Games making him an international at the senior level in three sports. Dick Thornett achieved the same distinction having also represented for Australia in water polo at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Dai Bishop represented Wales in British Baseball."

        "text": "Cog Hill Golf &amp; Country Club is a public golf course and country club located southwest of Chicago, in Lemont. Cog Hill hosted the PGA Tour's BMW Championship from 2009 to 2011 on its championship course Dubsdread, as well as 16 times when the tournament was known as the Western Open.\nHistory.\nThree brothers moved to the Chicago area in 1920. John W., Martin J., and Bert Coghill bought the McLaughlin farm on the west side of Palos Park, Illinois in 1926 to build a golf club. They then hired David McIntosh, who owned Oak Hills, to build them a golf course. Cog Hill Course #1 opened on the Fourth of July weekend in 1927. Reservations for golf were taken at Chicago's Boston Store, which, at that time, was one of the downtown Chicago's leading department stores. The Chicago and Joliet Electric Railway ran from Chicago to Lemont, giving golfers easy access for 25 cents.\nThe club expanded in 1929 when the three brothers bought another from the Reed family on the east side of Parker Road. Course #2 was designed and built by David McIntosh and Bert Coghill. It was opened in the fall of 1929, within days of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Even during the tough twelve years of the Great Depression, Cog Hill was able to prosper. In 1951, Joe Jemsek bought Cog Hill. Course #3 was added in 1963 and Dubsdread was completed in 1964.\nThe Western Golf Association awarded the Western Open to Cog Hill in 1991. It changed its name to the BMW Championship in 2007. Tiger Woods shot a course record 9-under 62 on Dubsdread in 2009. Woods has won the tournament at Cog Hill five times.\nTournaments.\nMajor championships held at Cog Hill's Dubsdread course.\nCourses.\nCourse #1 Blue.\nCourse #1 is the oldest course at Cog Hill. The Blue course was designed and built in 1927.\nCourse #2 Ravines.\nCourse #2 Ravines was designed and built in 1929. Ravines was adjusted for to host the 1997 United States Amateur Championship. Golf Digest rated the course 4-Stars and as one of \"America's 100 Best Courses for $100 or Less\".\nCourse #3 Red.\nIn 1963 Cog Hill added Course #3.\nCourse #4 Dubsdread.\nDubsdread was designed and built by Joseph L. Lee/Dick Wilson in 1964. It was renovated by Rees Jones in 2007–2008."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians.\nEarly life.\nDonald attended Buchanan High School in Clovis, California, where his father is the coach of the baseball team. He played college baseball for the University of Arizona. In 2004 and 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star in 2005.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nDonald was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the third round (97th overall pick) of the 2006 MLB draft. He was originally drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 20th round of the 2003 MLB draft directly from high school, but chose not to sign.\nDonald was selected and participated in several All-Star games during the course of the 2008 season including the Eastern League All-Star game, and the premier event for minor leaguers, the MLB All-Star Futures Game (which in 2008 was played at Yankee Stadium).\nIn 2009, Donald played nine games with the Gulf Coast League Phillies, going 6 for 26 (.231) before being assigned to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the International League. While with the Pigs, Jason had a .236 batting average with one home run over the course of 51 games.\nOn July 29, 2009, the Phillies traded Donald, along with Carlos Carrasco, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp to the Cleveland Indians for Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn May 18, 2010, replacing injured Cleveland Indians shortstop Asdrúbal Cabrera, Donald played against the Tampa Bay Rays and recorded his first major league hit on his first plate appearance. In his second at bat, he singled to right field against Rays starter David Price to begin his major league career 2-for-2. He then walked in his third at bat.\nOn June 2, 2010, Donald was the 27th batter faced by Armando Galarraga, who was one out away from pitching a perfect game. Donald hit a ground ball to the right side of first baseman Miguel Cabrera, who fielded the ball cleanly and tossed the ball to Galarraga, who was covering first base. First base umpire Jim Joyce called Donald safe, but replay showed that the throw beat Donald by one step.\nPost-MLB career.\nOn December 11, 2012, Donald was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in a three-team deal that also involved the Arizona Diamondbacks. Shin-Soo Choo went with Donald to Cincinnati. Cleveland acquired Drew Stubbs from the Reds and Trevor Bauer, Matt Albers and Bryan Shaw from the Diamondbacks.

Donald helped lead the United States to a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Donald homered in the bronze medal game and led the team at the games in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Donald batted .381 for the Games.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 2008, Donald received the Arizona Fall League's Dernell Stenson Sportsmanship Award."

He attended Southwest Missouri State University.\nPlaying career.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nDrafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 31st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, Palmer started his professional career strong by having a 1.83 ERA in 2002 with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. Palmer spent the 2003 season with the Hagerstown Suns. However, Palmer spent three seasons in Double-A before earning a promotion to Triple-A Fresno in 2006. In 2007, Palmer pitched 150 innings for Fresno, recording an 11-8 record with a 4.32 ERA.\nOn August 14, 2008, Palmer was called up by the Giants. He made his Major League debut on August 16 against the Atlanta Braves. He started but only lasted 2.1 innings and allowed 6 earned runs. After making 3 starts, he was sent back to Triple-A and became a free agent at the end of the season. He was 0-2 in his 3 starts for the Giants with an 8.53 ERA.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nIn December 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nIn 2009, Palmer would come on as a fifth starter, as the Angels starting rotation struggled to overcome injuries and the death of rookie Nick Adenhart. Palmer made his Angels debut on April 23, 2009, earning the win after pitching six innings, giving up five runs on six hits, three walks, and one strikeout. He continued in the Angels starting rotation amassing a 7-1 record until he was moved to the bullpen on July 1, 2009 when Ervin Santana returned. He finished the season 11-2 with a 3.93 ERA. His elevated win and loss record is helped by the fact that the Angels lineup scored 7.47 runs per game and scored in double figures five times he pitched.\nIn 2010, Palmer was seen as a possible fifth starter after Angels ace John Lackey signed with the Boston Red Sox.\nHowever, the signing of Joel Piñeiro diminished any chances of Palmer in the starting rotation, and he returned to the bullpen for the 2010 season. In 3 seasons in the Angels organization, Palmer pitched in 57 games (17 as starter) with a 4.22 ERA and 13-5 record. He also spent substantial time with the AAA Salt Lake Bees.\nSan Diego Padres.\nThe San Diego Padres signed Palmer to a minor league contract on December 1, 2011. He appeared in 3 games for the Padres in the Majors and allowed 2 earned runs in 2 innings. He was also 6-9 with a 5.66 ERA in 20 starts for the AAA Tucson Padres.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nPalmer signed as a minor league free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 9, 2013. During spring training, he tore the medial meniscus in his left knee, ending any chance he had to make the Dodgers roster. He eventually joined the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes roster in late April. In 25 games (22 of which were starts), he was 6-8 with a 3.84 ERA.\nSeattle Mariners.\nPalmer signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners in December 2013. On August 17, 2014, Palmer was released by the Mariners."

        "text": "The 2019 Rugby World Cup () was the ninth edition of the Rugby World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's rugby union teams. It was hosted in Japan from 20 September to 2 November in 12 venues all across the country. The opening match was played at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, Tokyo, with the final match being held at International Stadium Yokohama in Yokohama. This was the first time that the tournament had taken place in Asia and outside the traditional Tier 1 rugby nations.\nThe tournament saw the first cancellation of matches at the Rugby World Cup with Typhoon Hagibis affecting three matches due to the expected impact on safety that the typhoon would have.\nSouth Africa beat England 32−12 in the final to claim their third title, equalling New Zealand's record. In doing so, South Africa became the first team to win the title after losing a match in the pool stage. The defending champions, New Zealand, finished third after defeating Wales in the bronze final.\nHost country selection.\nThe International Rugby Board (IRB) requested that any members wishing to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup and/or the 2019 event should indicate their interest by 15 August 2008, though no details had to be provided at that stage. A record 10 unions responded, with the 2019 tournament of interest to nine nations. Russia initially announced plans to bid for both events, but withdrew both in February 2009 in favour of what proved to be a successful bid for the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Australia withdrew from the bidding process on 6 May 2009.\nThe three potential hosts – Italy, Japan and South Africa – were announced on 8 May 2009. At a special meeting held in Dublin on 28 July 2009, the IRB confirmed that England would be hosts in 2015 and Japan in 2019, with the approval of the tournament organisers Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWC Ltd), going in favour 16–10.\nVenues.\nThe IRB (which was renamed World Rugby in November 2014), RWC Ltd, the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU) and host organisers Japan 2019 went through a process of asking for expressions of interest and meeting with and explaining game hosting requirements to interested parties from late 2013. In May 2014, it was announced that 22 municipal and prefectural organisations across Japan had expressed interest. Those organisations were asked to enter formal bids by 31 October 2014. On 5 November, organisers announced that 14 bids had been received. Hong Kong and Singapore had expressed interest in hosting some of the matches and were included in Japan's bid, but were not among the 14 stadiums announced in 2014. Nissan Stadium in Yokohama, venue for the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final and Niigata's Denka Big Swan Stadium, also a World Cup venue, decided not to bid.\nSeveral changes to the venues submitted in the JRFU's original 2009 bid were made. The JRFU's own Chichibunomiya Stadium in Tokyo, suitable for smaller interest games in the capital, was not included in the plan. The JRFU selected the larger and more modern 50,000-seat Nagai multi-purpose stadium as its preferred venue for games in Osaka, though East Osaka City, which had taken over the Hanazono Rugby Stadium from long-time corporate owners Kintetsu in April 2015, submitted a joint bid with Osaka Municipality, intending to refurbish the stadium. Kamaishi, Hamamatsu, Kyoto, Ōita, Nagasaki and Kumamoto were also not part of the JRFU's bid. While the bids included venues from a broad area of Japan, two areas were not involved in hosting: Hokushin'etsu (Hokuriku and Kōshin'etsu regions), which includes the city of Niigata; and the Chūgoku region, which includes Hiroshima and the nearby island of Shikoku. No city in Chūgoku hosted games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but Hiroshima did host games in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.\nThe new National Stadium in Tokyo being constructed for the 2020 Summer Olympics was expected to be the primary venue of the tournament. However, the original plans were scrapped and rebid in 2015 due to criticism over its design and increasing costs. As a consequence, it would no longer be completed in time. The fixtures assigned to the stadium were re-located, with the opening match moved to Ajinomoto Stadium and the final moved to Nissan Stadium in Yokohama.\nQualifying.\nThe top three teams from the pools at the 2015 World Cup received an automatic spot, with the remaining eight teams coming from the qualifying series around the world. Six of the remaining eight spots available were filled by regional qualifiers with the additional two spots being filled in play-off. Qualifying was split into five regional groups; Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.\nOn 1 July 2017, the United States became the first team to qualify after defeating Canada in the two-leg match to qualify as America 1. The following two weeks saw Fiji and Tonga booking their spots as Oceania 1 and 2 respectively. Samoa later confirmed their spot as the third Oceanic team with a win over Germany in a two-legged tie the following year. In January 2018, Uruguay became the fourth team to qualify with a 10-point victory over Canada across the two legs to book a spot as Americas 2.\nIn March, Romania initially qualified to take the spot as Europe 1. But after complaints from the Spanish into an investigation of ineligible players, it was deemed that Romania, Spain and Belgium all broke the eligibility rules and were deducted points which meant Russia qualified for the World Cup while Germany headed to the play-off against Samoa. In August, Namibia became the final team to qualify from the continental tournaments after defeating Kenya in the final round of the Rugby Africa Gold Cup. The final spot was decided by a repechage tournament in Marseille in November 2018, which was won by Canada after winning all three of their games.\nDraw.\nThe pool draw took place on 10 May 2017, in Kyoto. The draw was moved from its traditional place of December in the year following the previous World Cup, after the November internationals, so that nations had a longer period of time to increase their world rankings ahead of the draw.\nThe seeding system from previous Rugby World Cups was retained with the 12 automatic qualifiers from 2015 being allocated to their respective bands based on their World Rugby Rankings on the day of the draw:\nThe remaining two bands were made up of the eight qualifying teams, with allocation to each band being based on the previous Rugby World Cup playing strength:\nThis meant the 20 teams, qualified and qualifiers, were seeded thus (world ranking as of 10 May 2017):\nThe draw saw a representative randomly draw a ball from a pot; the first drawn ball went to Pool A, the second Pool B, the third Pool C and the fourth Pool D.\nSquads.\nEach team submitted a squad of 31 players for the tournament, the same as the 2015 tournament. These squads were to be submitted to World Rugby with the deadline being 8 September with the United States being the last team to reveal their squad on 6 September.\nMatch officials.\nWorld Rugby named the following 12 referees, seven assistant referees and four television match officials to handle the 48 matches:\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place at Ajinomoto Stadium in Tokyo on 20 September 2019 at 18:30 (JST). The ceremony featured a showcase of traditional and modern Japanese culture, as well as the culture of rugby union, and told the story of the evolution of rugby union in Japan. New Zealand's Richie McCaw, who captained the All Blacks to the World Cup title in 2015, performed a ceremonial handover of the Webb Ellis Cup. Six jet aircraft of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's Blue Impulse aerobatic team flew over the stadium. Kiyoe Yoshioka of Japanese pop-rock band Ikimono-gakari sang \"World in Union\", the official song of the Rugby World Cup. The tournament was officially declared open by Fumihito, Prince Akishino of Japan; both he and World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont gave speeches at the end of the ceremony, with Beaumont saying:\nPool stage.\nThe 20 teams are divided into four pools of five teams. Each pool is a single round-robin of 10 games, in which each team plays one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams are awarded four league points for a win, two for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four tries in a match is awarded a bonus point, as is a team that loses by seven points or fewer – both bonus points are awarded if both situations apply. The teams finishing in the top two of each pool advance to the quarter-finals. The top three teams of each pool received automatic qualification to the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nIf two or more teams are tied on match points, the following tiebreakers apply:\nIf three teams were tied on points, the above criteria would be used to decide first place in the pool and then the criteria would be used again (starting from criterion 1) to decide second place in the pool.\nPool A.\nThe opening match of the 2019 Rugby World Cup was played in Pool A with Japan scoring a 30–10 win over Russia. Kotaro Matsushima became the first Japanese player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup. For the Russian side, Kirill Golosnitsky scored the first try of the tournament after four minutes – the fastest try ever scored in the opening match of a World Cup. Two days later, Ireland defeated Scotland 27–3. On 24 September, Samoa played their first match against Russia in Kumagaya, and Samoa went on to win 34–9. Four days later, hosts Japan defeated Ireland 19–12, scoring four out of six penalties. While it was an upset win for Japan, World Rugby later admitted three of the four offside penalties were incorrectly awarded to Japan. Kenki Fukuoka scored a try in the 58th minute to give Japan a two-point lead after Ireland's Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney had scored the opening two tries. Yu Tamura's conversion and fourth successful penalty kick sealed the result for Japan. Scotland recorded their first victory of the World Cup with a 34–0 whitewash victory over Samoa in muggy conditions in Kobe, with Samoan captain Jack Lam stating that the rugby ball was \"a bar of soap.\"\nThree days later, Kobe Misaki Stadium held another match in Pool A – this time it was Ireland, who whitewashed their opponents (Russia) in a 35–0 victory with five different players getting tries for the Irish. The Irish though, did not have everything go right with Jordi Murphy being subbed off in the 27th minute due to a possible rib injury, which added to the Irish back row pain after losing Jack Conan earlier in the tournament. Japan recorded their third victory over Samoa in Toyota with a 85th minute try from Kotaro Matsushima sealing the Japanese a 38–19 bonus point victory. Russia in the final match of the tournament was hammered by Scotland 61–0 with George Horne scoring a hat-trick as the Scots became the first team in World Cup history to not concede a point from two consecutive World Cup matches. A red card to Bundee Aki in the 29th minute forced Ireland to go down to 14 men but that was the only blemish with Ireland winning 47–5 over Samoa in Fukuoka. Johnny Sexton scoring two tries for the Irish. The typhoon saw the Japan–Scotland match under threat with the Scottish Rugby Union demanding legal action if it was cancelled. But after an inspection deemed the match to go ahead, Japan held their nerve against a fast-finishing Scotland to take home a 28–21 victory with Kenki Fukuoka scoring two tries. The win saw Japan become the first Tier 2 team to qualify since 2007, as they topped the group while Ireland finished in second place.\nPool B.\nPool B started with New Zealand beating South Africa 23–13. New Zealand opened their scoring with two tries in four minutes from George Bridge and Scott Barrett giving New Zealand a 17–3 lead at half-time. Pieter-Steph du Toit scored a converted try to bring the score back to 17–10 but two penalties from Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett sealed the result. In Higashiōsaka, Italy conceded an early try against Namibia before running away with a bonus-point victory by 25 points. Italy earned a second bonus-point victory in Fukuoka, scoring seven tries in a 48–7 demolition of Canada. Over in Toyota, South Africa defeated Namibia by 54 points, scoring nine tries while Namibia could manage only a Cliven Loubser penalty in the 23rd minute. New Zealand recorded their second victory of the World Cup with a 63–0 victory over Canada at Ōita Stadium. For New Zealand, Brad Weber scored his first two tries in international rugby with the Barrett brothers (Jordie Barrett, Beauden Barrett and Scott Barrett) each scoring a try as they became the first trio of brothers to start for New Zealand.\nNew Zealand continued their demolition of their opponents with a 62-point win over Namibia in Chōfu, with the floodgates opening in the second half after Namibia restricted the All Blacks to 24 points in the first half. Sevu Reece, Ben Smith and Anton Lienert-Brown scoring two tries in the match. Between the two New Zealand games, South Africa romped over Italy with Cheslin Kolbe scoring two tries as the South Africans won 49–3 in Fukuroi. This was followed by a 66–7 victory over Canada with Cobus Reinach scoring the fastest hat-trick in World Cup history, with his three tries being scored in a space of 11 minutes. The final two matches of the group were not played as Typhoon Hagibis saw the cancellation of the New Zealand–Italy and Namibia–Canada matches. At the end of the pool stage, New Zealand finished on top of the table with South Africa finishing second.\nPool C.\nPool C's opening match saw Argentina come back from a 17-point half-time deficit against France at Tokyo Stadium, only for France's Camille Lopez to score a game-winning drop goal in the 70th minute to win 23–21. In Sapporo, two tries from Manu Tuilagi helped England to a bonus-point victory over Tonga. England followed that up with a 38-point victory over the United States, with Joe Cokanasiga scoring two tries in the victory; however, the match was soured by the first red card of the tournament, shown to the United States' John Quill for a shoulder charge to the head of England's Owen Farrell. Argentina bounced back from their defeat by France with a 28–12 victory over Tonga in Higashiōsaka; all of Argentina's scoring happened in the first 28 minutes, including a hat-trick from Julián Montoya as they raced to a 28-point lead before Tonga brought the margin back to 16 with two tries of their own. After Typhoon Mitag almost cancelled the match, the French were inconsistent with errors keeping the United States in the match before three late tries in the second half secured a 33–9 win in Fukuoka.\nIn Chōfu, England qualified for the quarter-finals with a 39–10 victory over Argentina with Argentinean player Tomás Lavanini being shown a red card, which forced Argentina down to 14 men as he was forced off due to a high tackle on Owen Farrell's head. France later joined them in qualifying for the knockout stage with a two-point victory over Tonga at Kumamoto Stadium. After conceding the first 17 points of the match, Tonga came back into the match with tries from Sonatane Takulua and Mali Hingano to close the gap to only three points before Romain Ntamack gave the cushion that France needed with two penalties in eight minutes giving France the victory. Argentina became the first team to finish their matches of the 2019 World Cup, with a 47–17 victory over the United States in Kumagaya. Joaquín Tuculet and Juan Cruz Mallia each scored two tries in the meeting, their first since 2003. After the England–France game was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Tonga ended their World Cup campaign with a 31–19 victory over the United States. This was due to the Tongan's using their opportunities with them converting into tries and despite the United States being within striking range with three minutes to go, Telusa Veainu converted the match-winning try and a bonus-point victory for Tonga. At the end of the pool stage, it was England winning the group with France finishing in second place.\nPool D.\nPool D opened with Australia beating Fiji by 18 points in Sapporo after Fiji led by two points at half-time. Australia scored four tries in the second half for the bonus point. Wales beat Georgia 43–14 at City of Toyota Stadium, after leading 29–0 at half-time and 22–0 after three tries in the first 19 minutes. In Kamaishi, Fiji scored the opening try against Uruguay. Two mistakes within eight minutes gave Teros the lead before a try from Juan Manuel Cat enhanced it to 12 points at half-time. Three Fijian tries in the second half were to no avail as two penalty goals from Felipe Berchesi gave Uruguay their first win in a World Cup since 2003. In Kumagaya on 29 September, Georgia recorded a 33–7 win over Uruguay. Dominant work by their forwards in the second half laid the foundation for the bonus-point victory. Over in Chōfu, Dan Biggar scored the fastest drop goal in World Cup history as Wales led 23–8 at the half. Two second-half tries from Australia brought the scores to within a point but the Welsh held out for a 29–25 win.\nA second half performance from Fiji at a wet Hanazono Rugby Stadium saw the Fijians record their first win of their 2019 World Cup campaign as they won 45–10 over Georgia. This was partly due to Semi Radradra scoring two tries while also aiding in setting up three more tries as Fiji scored seven tries to one in the bonus-point victory. Another slow start for the Australians in their game with Uruguay did not stop them from recording a win over the South Americans, with Tevita Kuridrani and Dane Haylett-Petty each getting two tries in the 35-point victory at Ōita Stadium. Four days later at the same stadium, Fiji got off to a 10–0 lead with the tries coming from Josua Tuisova and Kini Murimurivalu within eight minutes. Fiji held their lead until the 31st minute when Josh Adams scored his second try of three for the match. Wales increased their lead from there to win 29–17, qualifying for the quarter-finals with Australia. The penultimate match of Pool D saw Australia outlast a tough Georgia in difficult conditions in Fukuroi, as they won 27–8. Wales finished undefeated with a 35–13 win over Uruguay at Kumamoto Stadium to record a bonus-point victory and set up a quarter-final with France while Australia came in second.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage of the Rugby World Cup consisted of three single-elimination rounds leading to a final and a third-place playoff. Following a tie in regulation time, two 10-minute periods of extra time would be used to determine a winner. If the scores are tied at the end of extra time, an additional 10-minute \"sudden death\" period is played, with the first team to score any points being declared the winner. If the score remains tied at the end of extra time, a kicking competition would ensue.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first two quarter-finals were played on Saturday. The first quarter-final saw England defeat Australia 40–16 at Ōita Stadium. Two tries from Jonny May, plus the 18 turnovers that the Australians conceded and led to two more being scored by England, sealed the result that prompted Michael Cheika to resign as Australian coach. The following match saw New Zealand book their spot in the semi-finals, with the All Blacks cruising to a 46–14 win over Ireland at Tokyo Stadium. Aaron Smith scored two of the All Blacks' seven tries, with the Irish only getting on the board in the 69th minute from a Robbie Henshaw converted try. A penalty try was then added seven minutes later.\nThe other two quarter-finals were played the following day. In the opening match, France got off to an early 12–0 lead with Sébastien Vahaamahina and Charles Ollivon both scoring tries in the first eight minutes. Aaron Wainwright opened the Welsh account with a try in the 12th minute before Virimi Vakatawa scored the French's third, giving them a 19–10 lead at the break. Nine minutes into the second half, France went down to 14 men with Sébastien Vahaamahina being red-carded for an elbow to Aaron Wainwright as Wales went on to win the match 20–19 with a 74th minute try to Ross Moriarty. In the last quarter-final match, it was South Africa who claimed a 26–3 win over Japan with Makazole Mapimpi scoring two tries in the victory.\nSemi-finals.\nIn the first semi-final, England took on New Zealand in front of 68,843 spectators in Yokohama. In response to New Zealand's haka, England's players stood in a V-shape formation, for which they were later fined having crossed the halfway line. England scored the opening points of the game in the second minute with a try from Manu Tuilagi, converted by Owen Farrell. After two penalties on either side of the half, the All Blacks responded in the 57th minute to close the gap to six points with a converted try from Ardie Savea, but two later penalties in the 63rd and the 69th confirmed England's spot in the final.\nThe second semi-final was also played in Yokohama, as the 67,750 spectators in attendance saw South Africa take on Wales for a spot against England in the final. South Africa took a 9–6 lead into half-time, but Biggar levelled the scores with a penalty kick six minutes into the second half. Damian de Allende then scored the first try of the match in the 57th minute, fending off two Welsh tacklers to score from 20 metres out. Wales again equalised thanks to Josh Adams scoring down the short side from an attacking scrum on the South African five-metre line; however, they were penalised for collapsing a maul with five minutes left in the game, allowing Pollard to kick the winning points and book South Africa a spot in the final.\nBronze final.\nThe bronze medal was won by New Zealand in a convincing win over Wales. \nFinal.\nEngland started as favourites for the final, but they had an unfortunate start to the game as Kyle Sinckler was substituted in the third minute after colliding with Maro Itoje, leaving England with only one tighthead prop. South Africa tight forwards Bongi Mbonambi and Lood de Jager left the field through injuries in the 21st minute. During the first half the only points scored were from penalties, with South Africa leading 12–6 at half time after several handling errors by England. England came close to scoring a try, but did not manage to score after 26 phases.\nTwo more successful penalties on either side made the score 18–12 at the beginning of the second half. Makazole Mapimpi scored the first try in the 66th minute, making South Africa's lead 25–12 after the conversion while becoming the first Springbok to score a try in a World Cup final. Cheslin Kolbe followed up with another try eight minutes later, making the final score 32–12.\nTyphoon Hagibis and match cancellations.\nOn 10 October, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee announced that, due to the predicted weather caused by Typhoon Hagibis, the Pool B meeting between New Zealand and Italy and the Pool C meeting between England and France had been cancelled. The decisions had been made on safety grounds with considerations on the expected impact the typhoon would have on Tokyo, including likely public transport shutdown or disruption. This was the first ever occasion any Rugby World Cup match had been cancelled. Decision on cancellation of pool games scheduled for 13 October was made on the day of the game, including the match between Japan and Scotland.\nOn the evening of 12 October Japan Standard Time (JST), World Rugby and the Japan 2019 Organising Committee released a statement that they had advised Namibia and Canada of the possibility of their game being cancelled, with the typhoon predicted to impact Kamaishi. On 13 October, World Rugby and the Japan 2019 Organising Committee announced the cancellation of the Namibia–Canada game in Kamaishi. The decision was made following a level 5 evacuation order in the city on the day of the match following the typhoon. Canada's national team stayed in Kamaishi to help out local residents with their cleanup efforts. The Namibia national team interacted with fans in the campsite Miyako City.\nShortly after the announcement of the cancellation of the Namibia–Canada game, it was confirmed that the matches between Wales and Uruguay and the United States and Tonga would go ahead as scheduled. By noon on 12 October, it was confirmed that the match between Japan and Scotland was unaffected by the typhoon and would take place as scheduled, in front of spectators who had previously feared that they might have missed out with the game played behind closed doors.\nIn line with tournament rules, the canceled pool matches were declared as drawn, the points being shared two each with no score registered. With these cancellations, France were unable to compete for the top pool position (held by England at the time), with a victory to secure that place. For Italy, however, the cancellation effectively eliminated them from the tournament; a victory against defending champions New Zealand could have seen them qualify for the knock-out stage, dependent on the margin of the win. This also had implications on whether South Africa finished top of their pool or as runners-up, having already confirmed their progression to the quarter-finals.\nBroadcasting.\nFor the first time, the domestic rights holder did not serve as the host broadcaster of the tournament. Instead, International Games Broadcast Services (IGBS), a joint venture between Host Broadcast Services (HBS) and IMG, handled production of the footage distributed to rights holders. IGBS used production resources from traditional rugby nations such as Australia, France, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Japanese broadcaster NHK covered selected games in 8K resolution, using a combination of nine 8K cameras and up-converted 4K resolution footage from IGBS. The International Broadcast Centre was located outside Ajinomoto Stadium.\nWorld Rugby streamed the tournament on its website for unsold markets. Sport24 was the rights holder for in-flight/in-ship broadcast. In South Africa, pay television channel SuperSport had broadcasting rights. To enable the whole country to watch, the free-to-air South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) broadcast the final after they reached an agreement with MultiChoice.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "The 2009 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship as the State Farm Home Run Derby) was a home run hitting contest in Major League Baseball (MLB) between four batters each from the National League and American League. The derby was held on July 13, 2009, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, the host location of the 2009 MLB All-Star Game. ESPN (United States), Rogers Sportsnet (Canada), and ESPN America (Europe) telecast the event, while ESPN Radio broadcast on radio.\nThe winner of the event was Prince Fielder of the Milwaukee Brewers.\nRules.\nEach participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he receives 10 outs in each round.\nIn the first two rounds, home run totals carried over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a \"Swing-Off\" takes place. In a Swing-Off, each tied player gets 5 swings to get as many home runs as possible. Home runs hit during a first round Swing-Off does not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participated in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi-finals. The top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores deleted from the first two rounds.\nCharitable Initiatives.\nGold Ball.\nWhen a player reaches nine outs in each round, the \"Gold Ball\" was brought into play. For each Gold Ball hit for a home run, State Farm agreed to donate US $17,000 (one dollar for each of their agents) for each home run hit to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. This marks the fifth Home Run Derby for the Gold Ball rule. Each non-Gold Ball homer was worth $5,000. Overall, $527,000 was raised.\nStand Up 2 Cancer.\nMasterCard International would have donated $1 million to the Stand Up to Cancer initiative if a player had hit a home run off one of three designated banners in the stadium, which nobody did. Previously, sponsors like MasterCard and Chevrolet had given away 500 airline tickets and automobiles had home run balls hit designated banners. The banners remained in place for the All-Star Game."

        "text": "Kevin Huntley (born September 20, 1986) is a professional lacrosse player with the Toronto Nationals of Major League Lacrosse and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League. He plays the attack position. Huntley played collegiate lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University where he helped his team win two national championships, and finished his college career as the eighth all-time leading goal scorer in Johns Hopkins history. His father, Dave Huntley, was also an All-American at Johns Hopkins. In 2008, Huntley was named Major League Lacrosse Rookie of the Year.\nCollegiate career.\nHuntley won two national championships while playing with the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. As a freshman, he played in fifteen games and helped the Blue Jays win the 2005 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. He led his team in goals during the tournament. In 2006, as a sophomore, Huntley was awarded USILA third team All-American honors. In his junior season he helped his team win the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. In the Blue Jays' quarterfinal game against Georgetown University, Huntley scored a career high five goals. Earlier in the contest, Huntley was penalized for using an illegal stick. When he returned to play he was using a teammate's stick when he scored all five goals. As a senior, Huntley and the Blue Jays were again in the national championship game; however, this time they were defeated by the Syracuse Orange.\nBefore playing at Hopkins, Huntley was twice awarded the All-Metro High School Player of the Year by the Baltimore Sun while playing at Calvert Hall College High School. In addition, as a sixteen-year-old, he represented Team Canada at the 2003 Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships, helping his team win the silver medal.\nHuntley and his father Dave Huntley, a former All-American midfielder at Johns Hopkins, are the only father–son duo to win two national championships, and are only the second pairing to score 100 or more goals each in their respective Division I lacrosse careers.\nProfessional career.\nHuntley began his professional career with the Los Angeles Riptide in 2008. Originally drafted by the San Francisco Dragons 17th overall in the 2008 MLL Collegiate Draft, Huntley was immediately traded to the Riptide on draft day. Huntley joined a Riptide team that was coached by Huntley family friend John Tucker.\nHuntley has had an immediate impact on the league, and was named Rookie of the Week three times, Offensive Player of the Week once. He also set a record for the most goals scored by a rookie in Major League Lacrosse, breaking Adam Doneger's mark set in 2003. Following the season, Huntley was presented the Major League Lacrosse Rookie of the Year Award.\nOn February 12, 2010 it was announced Huntley was traded to the Hamilton Nationals along with four other players."

        "text": "Helsinki Swimming Stadium is an outdoor swimming venue in Helsinki, Finland, located in the Eläintarha area to the northeast of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.\nHistory.\nThe Swimming Stadium was designed by architect Jorma Järvi in the Functionalist style prevalent during the 1930s. The stadium was built for the 1940 Olympic Games which were cancelled due to World War II, but later hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics.\nBecause of the war, the construction of the Swimming Stadium was delayed, it was finally completed in 1947. In wartime, the finished pools were used to store herring and root vegetables.\nAccording to the International Swimming Federation, the water temperature in the pool needed to be at least 22 °C, nowadays 27 °C. The machinery to heat the outdoor pool was ordered from abroad, and the ship transporting them was sunk immediately after the war broke out.\nThe stadium has been listed as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland by Docomomo.\nCurrent use.\nThe Swimming Stadium is a popular recreational venue for citizens. It is open from the beginning of May to the end of September. In summertime it is visited by about 5,000 swimmers every day – 290,000 altogether in summer 2013. The stadium has three pools: a 50-metre exercise swimming pool, a diving pool and a children's pool, and a small, shallow, round wading pool for small children a little further away. The diving pool has two 1 metre and two 3 metre high springboards, and a 1-metre plateau in front of the diving tower. Use of the diving tower is controlled and requires lifeguard supervision. The 1 and 3 metre springboards are almost always freely usable by customers. However, when swimming teams or clubs come to practice at the Stadium, the 3 metre springboard may be reserved for their use.\nThe area also has a water slide, a gym, a basketball court, a volleyball field, a table tennis table and a café. The gym is open year-round.\nOutside normal opening times, the Stadium is used a practicing place for other aquatic sports, diving schools use the diving pool as practice place.\nThe Swimming Stadium was also the scene for filming the popular Finnish youth television show Summeri in 2003–2009 and 2011.\nIn January 2009, the city of Helsinki initiated a discussion of keeping the Helsinki Swimming Stadium heated throughout the entire autumn and winter, in order to make it accessible for outdoor swimming during the entire year, in honour of the 90th anniversary of the Sports Bureau of Helsinki. However, this idea was abandoned as too expensive."

        "text": "The men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from February 16–28, 2010. Games were hosted at two venues – Canada Hockey Place (renamed from \"General Motors Place\" for the Olympics due to IOC rules disallowing host venues to be named after non-Olympic sponsors) and UBC Thunderbird Arena. These Olympics were the first to take place in a city with a National Hockey League team since the NHL players were introduced in 1998, which meant players on the Vancouver Canucks who were competing in the Olympics were playing in their home arena: Roberto Luongo for Canada, Ryan Kesler for the United States, Pavol Demitra for Slovakia, Sami Salo for Finland, Christian Ehrhoff for Germany, and Daniel and Henrik Sedin for Sweden.\nTeams from twelve national hockey associations competed, seeded into three groups for the preliminary round. The tournament consisted of 30 games: 18 in the preliminary round (teams played the other teams in their own group); 4 qualification playoff games; 4 quarterfinal games; 2 semifinal games; 1 bronze medal game; and 1 gold medal game.\nDuring the tournament, Teemu Selänne of Finland became the all-time leader for points scored in the Olympics. He notched an assist in his second game of the tournament for 37 career points, surpassing Valeri Kharlamov of the Soviet Union, Vlastimil Bubník of Czechoslovakia, and Harry Watson of Canada. Sweden's goaltender Henrik Lundqvist set a modern-day Olympic shutout streak record of 172 minutes and 34 seconds, continuous from the final of the gold medal game of the 2006 Olympics until Sweden's quarterfinal against Slovakia.\nThe tournament was won by Canada for the record eighth time (one more than the Soviet Union), which defeated the United States in overtime in the gold medal game. \nQualification.\nBelarus, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States qualified as the top nine teams in the IIHF World Ranking. Germany, Latvia and Norway qualified via the qualification tournament for teams ranked 10th through 30th.\nPreliminary round.\nPoints to each team were awarded as follows:\nIf two or more teams were tied in points, the following tiebreaker criteria were used:\nIf a criterion left only two teams tied, then those teams were ranked based on their head-to-head result.\nGroup A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;section begin=C /&gt;&lt;section end=C /&gt;\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C5 /&gt;&lt;section end=C5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C6 /&gt;&lt;section end=C6 /&gt;\nPlayoff round.\nFollowing the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1D through 12D. To determine this ranking, the following criteria were used \"in the order presented\":\nQualification playoffs.\nThe top four ranked teams (1D–4D) received byes to and were deemed the home team in the quarterfinals as they were seeded to advance, with the remaining eight teams (5D–12D) playing qualification playoff games as follows:\nIf the score remained even after regulation, a 10-minute overtime period was played. If neither team scored, a shoot out of three rounds of penalty shots decided the winner. The four winners of these qualification playoff games advanced to the quarterfinal round, while the losers of the qualification playoff games received a final ranking of 9 through 12 based on their preliminary round ranking.\nAll times are local (UTC−8)\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D4 /&gt;&lt;section end=D4 /&gt;\nQuarterfinals.\nTeams seeded D1 to D4 were the home teams. If the teams were tied after 60 minutes of regulation, a 10-minute overtime period decided the winner immediately upon the next goal. If the game remained tied after the overtime period, a penalty shot competition determined the winning team.\nFollowing the quarterfinal games, the winning teams were re-ranked F1 through F4, with the winner of 1D vs. E4 re-ranked as F1, the winner of 2D vs. E3 re-ranked as F2, the winner of 3D vs. E2 re-ranked as F3, and the winner of 4D vs. E1 re-ranked as F4. The losers of the quarterfinal round games received a final ranking of 5 through 8 based on their preliminary round ranking.\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=E3 /&gt;&lt;section end=E3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=E4 /&gt;&lt;section end=E4 /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=F1 /&gt;&lt;section end=F1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\nBronze medal game.\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=G1 /&gt;&lt;section end=G1 /&gt;\nGold medal game.\nAll times are local (UTC−8).\n&lt;section begin=G2 /&gt;&lt;section end=G2 /&gt;\nThe gold medal game was a rematch of the men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, United States. In addition, Chris Pronger, Scott Niedermayer, Martin Brodeur and Jarome Iginla of Team Canada were returnees from the 2002 gold-winning squad and collected their second gold medal. Brian Rafalski and Chris Drury were the only players remaining from USA's 2002 silver squad.\nThe final score was a 3–2 win for Team Canada. Goal scorers for Canada were Jonathan Toews, Corey Perry and Sidney Crosby, with the winning goal scored in overtime. For USA, the goal scorers were Ryan Kesler and Zach Parise, the latter tying the game with 25 seconds left, forcing it to go into sudden death.\nSidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal off a pass from Jarome Iginla, seven minutes and forty seconds into overtime for Canada, gaining victory over the United States. The puck has been sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto; in Canadian media, Crosby's goal has been compared in significance to the ones scored by Paul Henderson in the 1972 Summit Series and Mario Lemieux in the 1987 Canada Cup.\nThe referees for the final were Bill McCreary (Canada) and Dan O'Halloran (Canada), while the linesmen were Stefan Fonselius (Finland) and Jean Morin (Canada).\nThe gold medal game was the last competitive event at the Olympics before the closing ceremony.\nTelevision ratings.\nThe gold medal game drew a big hockey audience in both Canada and the United States.\nIn Canada, the game drew an average 16.6 million viewers while 26.5 million Canadians watched at least part of the game. Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium claims that 22 million people – or two thirds of the Canadian population – were watching the gold medal game when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime, making the game the most-watched television broadcast in Canadian history. However, a new ratings system intended to better track out-of-home viewership was only implemented in August 2009, making it difficult to accurately compare these results with ratings prior to that date – specifically, the 2002 Canada–USA gold medal game in Salt Lake City, the record holder under the previous system. There was some speculation that the final game of the 1972 Summit Series had as many as 18 million viewers, although recently recovered Nielsen ratings archives indicate that only 4.255 million Canadians watched that game live.\nIn the United States, NBC said that the game was the most-watched hockey game in the U.S. in 30 years, drawing 27.6 million, the largest since the United States–Finland game that decided the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nFinal rankings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to the IIHF:\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam Finland was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 31 years and 5 months. Team USA was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 27 years and 2 months. Gold medalists team Canada averaged 28 years and 2 months. Tournament average was 29 years.\nLeading scorers.\n\"Rankings based upon points.\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n\"Goalkeepers with 40% or more of their team's total minutes.\"\nShutout posters\nAwards.\nUnited States' Ryan Miller was named the most valuable player and received the Directorate Award for best goaltender of the tournament. Directorate Awards also went to Brian Rafalski (United States) for best defenceman, and to Jonathan Toews (Canada) for best forward.\nThe tournament all-star team was voted on by the international media at the conclusion of the event. The following players were named:\nToews, along with Brent Seabrook and Duncan Keith would become the fourth, fifth and sixth players to win both Olympic gold medal and Stanley Cup (with the Chicago Blackhawks) in the same year, following Ken Morrow 1980, and Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan (2002). Patrick Kane would become the fourth player to win both Olympic silver medal and Stanley Cup in the same year, following Red Wings Sergei Fedorov in 1998, and Chris Chelios and Brett Hull in 2002.\nTriple Gold Club.\nThe Triple Gold Club, made up of individuals who have won the Stanley Cup plus gold medals at the Olympics and World Championships, gained two new members:\nLater the same season, Team Canada centre Jonathan Toews would go on to become the 24th and youngest player in the Triple Gold Club, following up his Olympic gold medal with the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks just four months after winning Olympic gold. He had previously won the World Championships in 2007.\nOfficials.\nGames were primarily officiated by NHL referees, a stipulation by the NHL if most Olympic players are NHLers, according to the IIHF (not NHL) rules."

        "title": "Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Canada hosted and participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canada previously hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Canada sent a team of 206 athletes (116 men, 90 women), including participants in all 15 sports, and finished with 14 gold medals and 26 in total (ranking 1st and 3rd respectively), surpassing their previous best medal performance at the 2006 Winter Olympics. The 14 gold medals also set the all-time record for most gold medals at a single Winter Olympics, one more than the previous record of 13 set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. This record was matched at the 2018 PyeongChang Games when Germany and Norway tied it, and broken at the 2022 Beijing Games by Norway. Canada was the first host nation to win the gold medal count at a Winter Olympics since Norway at the 1952 Winter Olympics.\nBrian McKeever became the first Canadian athlete to be named to both Paralympic and Olympic teams, although he did not compete in the Olympic Games.\nPreparation.\nIn May 2009, a motion for the Canadian Olympic team to wear seal skin on their uniforms was unopposed in Canadian parliament. The motion read: \"That, in the opinion of the House, the government should take advantage of the opportunity provided by the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games to promote seal products, particularly by studying the possibility of using these products in the making of the Canadian Olympic clothing.\" The motion was proposed by Raynald Blais of the Bloc Québécois in protest of the European Parliament's passing of a bill to ban the import of seal products. Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive officer Chris Rudge quickly dismissed the idea, saying \"It would be inappropriate for us and I think it would be inappropriate to use the athletes as a voice for issues that accrue to other elements to our society.\"\nOwn the Podium program.\nAfter Canadian athletes failed to obtain a gold medal in either the 1976 or 1988 Olympics, of which Canada were hosts, the Canadian Olympic Committee pledged to make Canada the top medal winning nation at 2010. They started the Own the Podium program and the Canadian government invested $120 million into the program.\nHockey uniform controversy.\nSince 1994, Canadian national hockey team players have worn uniforms that feature the logo of Hockey Canada, the governing body of the sport in Canada. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not allow the use of national federation logos, but did not strictly enforce the rule until the 2008 Summer Olympics. Canadian hockey teams used the Hockey Canada logo at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics, because the IOC does allow an exemption if the nation's National Olympic Committee approves. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) chose not to support an exemption. Chris Rudge, the COCs chief executive officer, said \"[Hockey Canada] is discontent is that we're not going the extra mile to go for an exemption for [them] ... but it's not our fight, it's the IOC's rule, and Hockey Canada knew this was coming. [...] We got directives on the summer uniforms two years ago, and we shared it then with the winter sports. We told them we didn't have the directives for winter sports at that time, but they had to know it was coming. … We let them know it would be a harder issue than before.\" Hockey Canada executives, concerned that they would lose money through apparel sales, unsuccessfully protested the decision. Bob Nicholson, president of Hockey Canada, said \"The COC is supposed to lead Canada into the Olympics and hopefully this isn't the way the COC is going to lead us over the next 13 months. [...] I just wish they would support us at the IOC level and they did not do that and I don't like that type of teammate.\" A new design was unveiled on 17 August 2009. According to Nicholson, the new jerseys will only be used in the 2010 tournament, and players will use the old version at other international tournaments.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe Canadian alpine skiing team is guaranteed 14 athletes, which is down from the original 22 (the maximum number a NOC may enter). The International Ski Federation (FIS) announced that the number of overall alpine skiers would be limited to 320, and that some of the guaranteed spots would go to smaller nations, so that there will be a more international field. Canada was originally guaranteed 14 skiers, although the number was later raised to 18, and can still enter a full team of 22 if other athletes meet the qualification standards. Gary Allan, president of Alpine Canada, felt that Canada should be allowed 22, arguing that television coverage and crowd reception will be better. Canada was allowed a team of 19 skiers, which was announced on 27 January 2010. That number was later increased to 22 when other nations were unable to fill their quotas.\nPrior to the announcement of the team, several athletes thought to be medal contenders were injured severely enough to keep them out of the Olympics, including 2009 world downhill champion John Kucera, Kelly VanderBeek, François Bourque and Jean-Philippe Roy.\nBiathlon.\nCanada sent eight biathletes to Vancouver. Canada had four individual entries in women's events but only one individual entry in men's events. However, as the host nation Canada was allowed to send a men's relay team. The men's team comprised Jean Philippe Leguellec, Marc-André Bédard, Brendan Green and Robin Clegg. The women's team, meanwhile, comprised Zina Kocher, Megan Imrie, Megan Tandy and Rosanna Crawford.\nBobsleigh.\nAs the host nation, Canada was guaranteed an entry in all three events (two-man, two-woman and four-man). Canada's full 12 athlete team was announced on 27 January 2010.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe 11 athlete team was announced on 22 January 2010. The team consisted of Ivan Babikov, George Grey, Alex Harvey, Devon Kershaw, Stefan Kuhn, Brian McKeever, 2006 gold medalist Chandra Crawford, Daria Gaiazova, Perianne Jones, 2006 silver medalist Sara Renner and Madeleine Williams. Brian McKeever, who is legally blind, competed at the 2002 and 2006 Winter Paralympics in both cross-country skiing and biathlon. He won four gold medals (two at each Games) in cross-country skiing as well as a silver and a bronze in biathlon. He would have been the first athlete in Olympic history ever to compete in the Winter Olympics after participating in the Paralympics. Four more cross-country skiers were announced on 27 January 2010: Drew Goldsack, Brent McMurtry, Gordon Jewett and Brittany Webster.\nCurling.\nCanada qualified both a men's and women's team. The representatives were decided at the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, held 6–13 December 2009, in Edmonton. Brad Gushue and his team, the gold medalists in the men's tournament in 2006, were unable to qualify for the trials, and did not get the chance to defend their gold medal. In the men's tournament, Canada was represented by the team of Kevin Martin, John Morris, Marc Kennedy and Ben Hebert. This was the second Olympic tournament for Martin, who won a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. In the women's tournament, the team of Cheryl Bernard, Susan O'Connor, Carolyn Darbyshire and Cori Bartel participated.\nMen's tournament.\nCanada had a bye in draws 3, 7 and 11.\n\"Tuesday, 16 February, 09:00\"\n\"Tuesday, 16 February, 19:00\"\n\"Thursday, 18 February, 09:00\"\n\"Thursday, 18 February, 19:00\"\n\"Friday, 19 February, 14:00\"\n\"Saturday, 20 February, 19:00\"\n\"Sunday, 21 February, 14:00\"\n\"Monday, 22 February, 09:00\"\n\"Tuesday, 23 February, 14:00\"\n\"Thursday, 25 February, 14:00\"\n\"Saturday, 27 February, 15:00\"\nWomen's tournament.\nCanada had a bye in draws 3, 5 and 7.\n\"Tuesday, 16 February, 14:00\"\n\"Wednesday, 17 February, 09:00\"\n\"Thursday, 18 February, 14:00\"\n\"Friday, 19 February, 19:00\"\n\"Sunday, 21 February, 09:00\"\n\"Sunday, 21 February, 19:00\"\n\"Monday, 22 February, 14:00\"\n\"Tuesday, 23 February, 09:00\"\n\"Tuesday, 23 February, 19:00\"\n\"Thursday, 25 February, 09:00\"\n\"Friday, 26 February, 15:00\"\nFreestyle skiing.\nThe full 18 athlete freestyle skiing team was announced on 24 January 2010. Dave Duncan was originally named to the men's ski cross team, but he broke his collarbone during a training run at the Olympics and was unable to compete. Brady Leman was named his replacement. However, Leman aggravated a broken tibia he suffered in 2009, and also did not compete. Replacing both of them was Davey Barr.\nFigure skating.\nCanada qualified two athletes or pairs in each of the four events for a total of 12 athletes. Participants were decided at the 2010 Canadian Figure Skating Championships.\nIce hockey.\nNational teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's management staff. The men's and women's national teams both qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nWith Vancouver being home to the Canucks, the 2010 Winter Olympics were the first to take place in an NHL market since the league started allowing its players to compete in the games in 1998 in Nagano, Japan.\nMen's tournament.\nA group of about 45 players were invited to an orientation camp in August 2009 (although players not invited could also have been named to the team) and the final 23 man roster was announced on 30 December 2009. The team was coached by Mike Babcock and included assistant coaches Ken Hitchcock, Lindy Ruff and Jacques Lemaire.\nGroup play.\nCanada played in Group A.\nWomen's tournament.\nIn March 2009, the national team staff named 22 players to the 2009 World Championship team, as well as four additional players who would not compete in 2009 but could potentially be included in the Olympic roster. The final roster of 21 players was announced on 21 December 2009. Brianne Jenner, Jocelyne Larocque, Delaney Collins, Jennifer Wakefield and Gillian Ferrari were included in the centralized roster, but were cut before the Olympics. The team, which includes 14 Olympic veterans and seven players making their Olympic debut, is coached by Melody Davidson.\nGroup play.\nCanada played in Group A.\nLuge.\nCanada's Olympic luge team, announced on 19 December 2009, in Whistler, British Columbia, consisted of ten athletes: six individual competitors and two teams for the doubles event. The women's team consisted of Alex Gough, Regan Lauscher and Meaghan Simister. The men's singles team will comprise Sam Edney, Jeff Christie and Ian Cockerline. For the men's doubles event, two teams participated: Chris &amp; Mike Moffat; and Tristan Walker &amp; Justin Snith. The Fast Track Group, the title sponsor of the team, announced that they would give $1 million (which would be split between the athlete and Canadian Luge Federation) to any athlete that won a gold medal. The company also offered $50,000 for a silver and $5,000 for a bronze.\nNordic combined.\nCanada sent a single athlete, Jason Myslicki, to compete in the Nordic combined.\nNote: 'Deficit' refers to the amount of time behind the leader a competitor began the cross-country portion of the event. Italicized numbers show the final deficit from the winner's finishing time.\nShort track speed skating.\nAs the host nation, Canada can send a full team of five men and five women for short track speed skating. Charles Hamelin finished third overall at the 2009 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships and was guaranteed a spot in the 2010 team by Speed Skating Canada. At the Canadian short-track speedskating trials, Jessica Gregg, Marianne St-Gelais, Kalyna Roberge and Tania Vicent earned spots on the women's team and Olivier Jean and Guillaume Bastille earned spots on the men's team with their performances. Valérie Maltais and François Hamelin were added to the women's and men's teams respectively as discretionary picks by the coaches. François-Louis Tremblay was unable to participate in the trials due to an ankle injury, but was given a bye and was named to the team. The number of skaters that will participate in each event will be determined by the team's performances at the first three World Cup events for the 2009–10 season.\nSkeleton.\nCanada's full six athlete team was announced on 27 January 2010.\nSki jumping.\nCanada's ski jumping team comprised Stefan Read, Mackenzie Boyd-Clowes, Trevor Morrice and Eric Mitchell. None of them reached the final.\nSnowboarding.\nJasey-Jay Anderson secured an Olympic berth in the parallel giant slalom by winning the event at the 2009 FIS Snowboarding World Championships. The full 18 athlete team was announced on 25 January 2010.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run.\nSpeed skating.\nCanada's speed skating team consisted of eight men and eight women. Canadian speed skaters participated in every event, with the exception of the men's 10,000 m. The team was named on 11 January 2010."

Lee High School in Montgomery, Alabama where he played several sports. According to the \"Montgomery Advertiser\", he \"came mighty close to signing a football scholarship at Troy State\" but chose instead to play college baseball at Chattahoochee Valley Junior College. At Chattahoochee, he was converted to catcher and, after two years, continued his college baseball career at Alabama.\nHe was selected in the Major League Baseball draft after each of his three college seasons and finally signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, who selected him in 1981 after his first season at Alabama. Hunt began to develop a drinking problem toward the end of the 1982 season but eventually won \"a six-month bout with alcoholism\" in 1983 after seeking help for himself, at which point he began advancing through the minor league system. \nIn June 1985, following an injury to catcher Darrell Porter, Hunt was called up to the Cardinals. On June 4, he recorded a hit in his first Major League at bat.\nHe had three hits in 19 at-bats in a total of 14 games. He moved to the Montreal Expos in the 1986 season. Hunt played in 21 games in 1986, with ten hits in 48 at-bats.\nIn a two-season career, he had a batting average of .194, with two career home runs and six RBI."

        "text": "The 2009 United States Open Championship was the 109th U.S. Open, held June 18–22 on the Black Course of Bethpage State Park on Long Island, in Farmingdale, New York. Lucas Glover won his only major title, two strokes ahead of runners-up Ricky Barnes, David Duval, and Phil Mickelson.\nThis was the second U.S. Open at Bethpage Black; the first in 2002 was won by Tiger Woods, also the defending champion. The 2009 edition was hit heavily by continuous rain throughout the tournament, and resulted in multiple suspensions of play. Mickelson announced that this would be his last tournament for a while, before he took time off to tend to his ailing wife, Amy, who had been recently diagnosed with breast cancer.\nCourse layout.\nBethpage State Park - Black Course\nField.\nAbout half the field each year consists of players who are fully exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open. Below is the list of the 74 players who were fully exempt for the 2009 U.S. Open. Each player is classified according to the first category in which he qualified, but other categories are shown in parentheses. Also listed are the 81 players who qualified through sectional qualifying.\nÁngel Cabrera (3,14,17), Michael Campbell, Jim Furyk (9,10,17), Retief Goosen (8,11,17), Geoff Ogilvy (8,9,12,13,14,17), Tiger Woods (3,4,5,8,9,12,13,17)\nDrew Kittleson\nZach Johnson (12,13,17), Phil Mickelson (5,9,10,12,13,17)\nTodd Hamilton, Pádraig Harrington (5,9,11,13,17)\nVijay Singh (9,10,13,17)\nHenrik Stenson (11,17)\nEduardo Romero\nEric Axley, Stewart Cink (9,10,17), Ernie Els (9,10,17), Miguel Ángel Jiménez (11,17), Rocco Mediate, John Merrick, Rod Pampling (16), Carl Pettersson (9,10), Heath Slocum, Brandt Snedeker, D.

Play was not restarted on Thursday, with the majority of players yet to tee off. Jeff Brehaut, through 10 holes, was one of four leading at 1-under par heading into Friday. Play was restarted on Friday morning and Mike Weir shot 64 (−6) to lead by two strokes at the end of the first round. Woods shot 74 (+4) with two double bogeys and three bogeys.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 19, 2009&lt;br&gt;Saturday, June 20, 2009\"\nThe round began at 5:00 pm on Friday afternoon and finished on Saturday afternoon. Because of the soft conditions caused by the heavy rain, many low scores were made during the second round. Ricky Barnes shot 65, and had a 36-hole record of 8-under par 132. Lucas Glover and Azuma Yano were also amongst the ones that shot very low scores. Woods shot 69 for 143 (+3), and Mickelson shot even par 70 to remain 1 under par at 139. The cut was at 144 (+4), the lowest at the U.S. Open since 2003, and was missed by major champions David Toms and Justin Leonard.\nAmateurs: \"Taylor (-2), Weaver (+1), Stanley (+4)\", Fowler (+6), Tringale (+7), Alexander (+8), Klaasen (+10), Martin (+10), Erdy (+12), Burgoon (+13), Kittleson (+13), Snyder (+14), Nagy (+16), Peterman (+16), Lewis (+21), Brock (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 20, 2009&lt;br&gt;Sunday, June 21, 2009\"\nMore heavy rain halted play at 6:55 pm on Saturday. The third round was resumed on Sunday at noon and completed in the late afternoon. Barnes and Glover both shot even par 70 to remain at the top of the leaderboard, while David Duval and Ross Fisher were five strokes back in a tie for third place. Weir struggled and fell back with a 74, Mickelson shot 69 to stay in contention, and Woods a 68 for 211 (+1), nine shots behind Barnes.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 21, 2009&lt;br&gt;Monday, June 22, 2009\"\nThe final round began Sunday evening until play was suspended due to darkness, with leaders Barnes and Glover on the second hole. Play resumed Monday morning. Barnes, who had held the lead through the second and third rounds, faltered on the front nine on Monday morning, and bogeyed five of the first nine holes. He shot one over par on the back nine, but was never able to catch up with Glover, his playing partner for the final two rounds. Duval had a triple-bogey at the par-3 3rd, but rallied on the back nine with three straight birdies before bogeying 17 and missing a birdie putt at 18 to finish at 2 under par. Woods made a charge on the back nine with birdies on 13 and 14, but then bogeyed 15 and parred the rest to finish even par. Mickelson tied Glover for the lead after making an eagle at 13 after hitting a perfect second shot on the par 5, but proceeded to miss a short birdie putt on 14, three-putt for bogey on 15, miss another putt on 16, and made another bogey on 17 on his way to finishing two strokes behind Glover and tied for second place with Barnes and Duval. It was Mickelson's fifth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open, breaking the record of four by Sam Snead, Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. (His sixth came four years later in 2013 at Merion.) Glover birdied 16 and parred the final two holes to seal the victory.\nAmateurs: Taylor (+8), Weaver (+9), Stanley (+13).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

Tim Clark won with a score of -5 (22), two shots better than José María Olazábal and Jack Newman. Three players shot a hole-in-one: John Merrick on the second hole, Greg Norman on the sixth, and Clark on the ninth.\nRound summaries.\nThe Masters Tournament is played over four days with an 18-hole round being played each day, for a total of 72 holes plus practice rounds and a par-three contest on the neighboring par-three course. Everyone outside the top 44 and ties or outside ten strokes of the leader was \"cut\" after two rounds.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 9, 2009\"\nThe first round weather conditions were sunny and calm. Chad Campbell, scored a 7 under par 65, which included five straight birdies in the first five holes. Campbell finished the day with a one stroke lead over Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan. Larry Mize shot a five under par 67 to be two strokes behind. Mahan led the field in total birdies with 9 in the first round.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 10, 2009\"\nCampbell continued his strong play with a 2 under par 70 to remain in the lead at 135 (−9) with Kenny Perry, who shot a bogey-free 67. Raymond Floyd, 1976 champion, Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 champion, and three-time winner Gary Player completed their final rounds at Augusta. Anthony Kim shot the day's low round with a 65, which included a new record for most birdies in a round with eleven.\nThe cut, the top 44 players and ties, was at 145 (+1), and fifty players advanced to the weekend. In all, 25 players shot sub-par rounds for the day and the scoring average was 73.74. For the tournament, 32 players were under par, and the scoring average was 72.99.\nAmateurs: Saxton (+3), Newman (+4), Kittleson (+6), Wilson (+10), Lee (+11).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 11, 2009\"\nThird round conditions were sunny, but with gusty winds that made scoring a bit tougher than the previous two days. Perry shot a two-under par 70 to remain in the lead at 205 (-11), with Ángel Cabrera who shot a 69. Campbell led for most of the day until a double bogey on the 16th hole and carded 72, two strokes back at 207. Jim Furyk finished another stroke back of Campbell. Five players shot the day's low round of 4 under par 68. Those players were: Jim Furyk -8, Steve Stricker -7, Sean O'Hair -4, Ian Poulter -4, and Steve Flesch -3.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 12, 2009\"\nSummary.\nPhil Mickelson birdied six holes on the front nine to score 30, tying the front-nine tournament record held by Johnny Miller, Greg Norman, and K. J. Choi. Third round co-leader Perry, age 48, led for most of the day; after birdies at 15 and 16, he disappointingly finished with bogeys at 17 and 18. He fell into a three-way tie at 276 (−12) with Cabrera and Campbell, leading to a sudden-death playoff.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nThe playoff began on the 18th hole and Campbell was eliminated after failing to get up and down from the right greenside bunker. Perry was just off the green to the right, chipped close, and tapped in for par. Cabrera scrambled after an errant tee shot and a recovery shot that ricocheted off a tree, fortuitously into the fairway. His third shot from ended away and he holed the par putt to extend the playoff. The next hole was the 10th, and Perry failed to get up and down from left of the green; Cabrera two-putted from for par to become the first Argentinian to win the Masters.\nControversies.\nRory McIlroy was involved in a controversial incident during the second round. In sixth place on the leaderboard with three holes left to play, McIlroy had double-bogeyed the 16th hole before hitting his approach shot into a bunker on the 18th hole. He failed with his first attempt to get the ball out of the bunker and kicked out at the sand, which could be an offense if it was deemed to be testing the condition of the hazard. He finished his round at 4:15 p.m. local time and at 8:40 p.m. was called to the clubhouse to view footage of the incident. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing, as a player is allowed to smooth over the sand provided that it does nothing to improve the position of the ball with regard to the next shot.\nAlso during the second round, while putting for birdie on the 15th green, Pádraig Harrington had stepped up to his ball and addressed it, but a gust of wind caused him to step away. The ball then moved, but since he had grounded his club previously, he was deemed to have caused it to move and was penalized one stroke. He sunk the putt and, with the penalty stroke added, scored a par 5 on the hole."

        "text": "Baseball Talk was a set of 164 \"talking\" baseball cards that were released by Topps and the LJN Corporation during the spring of 1989. Each card featured a plastic disk affixed to the back of an oversized baseball card. When placed in the SportsTalk player the cards would play two to three minutes of recorded audio. The player retailed for $24.99 and was labeled for ages six and up. It required four AA alkaline batteries to operate. \nThe cards featured most of the better known players in baseball in 1988 and were sold in toy stores throughout the United States and Canada during 1989 Major League Baseball season. LJN and Topps planned to debut talking NFL and NBA cards (it stated in print advertising \"Coming Soon - NFL Football and NBA Basketball Talking Cards), but those plans, along with follow-up MLB editions, were canceled as the card players often broke or played with poor audio quality. Stores were flooded with returned boxes of Baseball Talk and by the fall of 1989 many of the cards and players could be found in discount bins at places like Toys R Us and Target. At one point, packs of cards that had been priced at $4 a piece were selling for as low as 50 cents by stores that were eager to move a failed product.\nCards.\nThe SportsTalk player was sold with four cards (a checklist card that served as an introduction to the series, a Hank Aaron card, and the cards of 1988 stars Don Mattingly and Orel Hershiser). Additional cards were sold with four to a pack and were labeled in a manner that let the buyer know what cards were inside. Mel Allen narrated eight cards that featured highlights from historic games as well as 33 cards of former stars such as Babe Ruth and Duke Snider. Hall of Fame legends like Ted Williams, Sandy Koufax, Warren Spahn, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Bob Feller were omitted from the set as they did not agree to take part.\nDon Drysdale interviewed the players of the National League for their cards and Joe Torre did the same for the American League players. Many of the cards featured amusing or humorous anecdotes, such as Mike Flanagan recounting how his Japanese baseball glove manufacturer (Mizuno) spelled his name \"Mike Franagan\" and that the company's executives told him, \"Mr. Franagan, we're very grad you use our grub.\"\nRare collectibles.\nBecause the cards and players were on the market for a short period of time and that many of the players did not work well, a complete set and a working player sells for a Beckett book value of $250–300 (Beckett 2008 Almanac).\nChecklist.\nThe following is the numerical checklist for the only set of cards ever released for Baseball Talk.\n122 Present Day Players and Managers in 1988.\nBy Team.\nEach team was represented by at least three players except for the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who had two (Cal Ripken Jr. and Eddie Murray.) It is possible that the late season trade of Fred Lynn from Baltimore to Detroit did not allow time to find a third Oriole. The New York Mets had the most players with eight.\nOne Checklist card.\n164. Checklist\nSources and photographs.\n\"Topps to debut Baseball Talk\" \"Beckett Baseball Card Monthly\", March 1989.

        "title": "Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Three cities applied with bids to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (also known as \"XXIII Olympic Winter Games\" and \"XII Paralympic Winter Games\") in October 2009. The International Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Jacques Rogge, received three bids on October 15, 2009. The cities of Annecy, France, in the French Alps, Munich, Germany (host of the 1972 Summer Olympics), and Pyeongchang, South Korea, a two-time previous bidder, competed for the hosting rights to the event. This was the lowest number of bidding cities since the 1988 Summer Olympics, coincidentally also won by South Korea. The winning bid was announced on July 6, 2011, at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa by IOC President Jacques Rogge at 5.22 pm local time\nPyeongchang beat Munich and Annecy in the first round of votes with 63 of the 95 total votes.\nApplicant cities venues list.\nThese venues are from the applicant cities' mini bid books. Note that the selected candidate cities, and in particular Annecy, have changed their venues plan afterwards in the final proposal to the IOC.\nEvaluation of the applicant cities.\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\nA firm criteria for the Winter Olympics is the availability of alpine ski slopes of certain sizes, which narrows down potential locations fairly much, and often means locations in less populated areas. The men's downhill requires at least 700 meters altitude difference along around 3 kilometers length.\nAll three bidding cities were short-listed.\nCandidate cities overview.\nAll three cities suggested hosting the Games between February 9–25, 2018. The Paralympics will be held from March 9–18.\nAnnecy.\nAt first, the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) was quite reluctant in bidding for a Winter Games, preferring to focus on a bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, four cities (Annecy, Grenoble, Nice and Pelvoux) expressed interest in hosting the 2018 games. On September 24, 2008, the Olympic Committee announced it had granted these wishes and would bid in 2011. Annecy was elected as the official candidate city by the French NOC on March 18, 2009. The CNOSF acknowledged its tough competition, but intended to learn from the failure of Paris to secure the Summer Olympics recently with victory in Annecy, maintaining a humble approach.\nPrevious bid head Edgar Grospiron, Olympic skiing champion, stated, \"we have exceptional, spectacular scenery with Mount Blanc, economic strength with one million tourists every year, and so we believe that our bid is credible. We want to invite the world to a party in a world famous resort\". Grospiron was being assisted by IOC members and former Olympians Jean-Claude Killy and Guy Drut. However, his demission on December 12, 2010 raised questions on the viability of the bid. On January 10, 2011, Charles Beigbeder was named as the new CEO for the Annecy bid. In addition, Olympic champions Jean-Pierre Vidal and Pernilla Wiberg were appointed as Vice Presidents of the bid. Beigbeder said he would seek more financial support for the bid from the private sector. Also announced with Beigbeder's appointment was the selection of Pierre Mirabaud as Director General of the bid. Mirabaud had been a regional government prefect, experience which Beigbeder said was needed by the bid.\nOn February 12, 2011, the IOC evaluation commission completed its four-day inspection of the Annecy bid. During a brief press conference, commission chair Gunilla Lindberg was cautious in her praise of Annecy. On a positive note, she told reporters: \"We have during our visit witnessed very strong governmental support which the bid enjoys and this was highlighted by the presence of the President Sarkozy and many members of his cabinet throughout the visit. I think the bid committee of Annecy has listened to the comments made by the IOC [criticism of the spread-out venues in June] and there has been a big improvement, especially not having so many competition venues as was proposed.\" But there was no glowing assessment of the Annecy bid from Lindberg. The Swedish IOC member also gave no clue about any concerns that had arisen during the inspection team's four-day stay in the French Alpine town.\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy also travelled to Annecy to meet with the IOC Evaluation Commission inspecting the city's bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. \"The government will do everything possible, you can be sure, so that Annecy, applicant for the 2018 Winter Olympics, will be chosen,\" Sarkozy said. \"Annecy's victory will be the victory of the entire nation, standing behind you.\" While pledging his support for the bid he said \"you are trying hard. It's difficult. Your opponents are extremely powerful but I'm with you. If we win the Games it will be fantastic. And if we don't win, all we did will be useful for your cities and your region\".\nThe territory that was proposed to host the Games is concentrated in Annecy and Mont Blanc where 65% of the venues were already built and \"the world's leading winter sports destination\". In a reference to difficult snow conditions at the 2010 Winter Olympics, organizers made a guarantee of snow in Pays de Savoie where the average snowfall in February is 80 cm. Annecy is a smaller city, so the whole department of Haute-Savoie would have been used, including world-famous ski resorts like Chamonix, Megève, La Clusaz, Morzine and Le Grand Bornand. Spread over an area with a 50 km radius, everything is within an hour of Annecy, and two Olympic villages were planned., Of the 13 venues, six venues would have required permanent upgrades, two new venues were already planned to be built, and four other venues would have been built if the Games were hosted in Annecy. Sliding events would have been at La Plagne, the same facilities that were used for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and which were upgraded in 2008.\nHowever, in June 2010, the IOC criticized Annecy's bid stating that the competition venues were excessively dispersed. The IOC report was highly critical over the original venue plan, saying it would \"present major operational and financial challenges\" that would \"affect the Games experience for all client groups, particularly athletes\". On October 4, 2010 Annecy's leaders unveiled a new \"ultra-compact\" venue concept in response to the IOC concerns. Under the reworked venue plans, all ice and snow events would take place within a 21-mile radius at two main bases, Annecy and Chamonix, which are less than an hour apart and linked by motorway and the \"Games Train\". All alpine skiing would take place in Chamonix, which would also host ice hockey. All freestyle skiing and snowboard were centered on Annecy. Curling was relocated to Annecy, the hub of most ice sports, meaning that the Olympic Village would have been a little bigger than previously, to accommodate 2,500 athletes and officials. The revised bid moved the second Olympic Village (1,500 beds) from the Mont Blanc valley into the center of Chamonix.\nOn March 28, 2011, the CAO (Annecy Anti-Olympic Committee) stated that it wanted to tell people about what \"not only the excesses of the Olympics, the sport business, the financial stakes of multinationals and unacceptable demands of the IOC, but also on adverse impacts on the environment and on uncontrolled public spending with long-term debt for the Olympic city\". The group said it had collected 13,140 names for its petition opposing plans to bring the Winter Olympics to Annecy. In a press release issued on the 28th, the opposition group cited information reported exclusively by media outlet Around the Rings that an IOC poll showed only 51 percent of the local population supports the Annecy candidacy.\nBid costs were US$21 million. Venue construction was set for $419 million and transport/infrastructure costs (including some already planned and some dependent on the Games) was $2.1 billion. Among the transport costs were a new high-capacity gondola connection between Flaine and Mont-Blanc, and a train link. The nearest airport service would have been in Lyon and Geneva (35 minutes by car). Public support for the bid was 88% across France and 81% in the Annecy region.\nAnnecy's logo featured the French Alps, specifically Mont Blanc, as well as suggesting the letter \"A\" for Annecy.\nMunich.\nMunich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics, and if selected, it would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games (the title later was claimed by Beijing) and as well would be the first Olympics since 1936 Summer Olympics to have a single German nation following reunification. Berlin and Hamburg were considering a summer games bid for 2024 or 2028, but the German Olympic Committee put priority on the Munich bid. After Salzburg's failure to capture the 2014 bid, Germany felt it has a better chance and would have preferred the Olympics sooner rather than later. Munich's bid head was figure skating superstar Katarina Witt, replacing skiing star/filmmaker/entrepreneur Willy Bogner, Jr. who had to step down due to health reasons.\nMunich stressed an environmental approach and would have used existing venues in Munich (some from the 1972 Games), and existing venues in the Bavarian mountain resorts of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (location of the 1936 Winter Olympics) and Schönau am Königssee, an hour away by car. Fifteen competition venues were proposed – eight exist, three would have required construction and four would have been temporary. To take environmental responsibility, new venue construction would be on existing sites in order to minimize land use. Ice events would have been held in Munich in addition to the existing Olympic Stadium for ceremonies. The Olympic swimming pool would have been adapted into a curling venue, figure skating and short track would have been at Olympic hall, a hockey arena would have been on the site of the old cycling stadium, and a second ice hockey arena and a speed skating oval would have been dismantled and used elsewhere after the Games. Garmisch-Partenkirchen Snow Park would have housed nine snow venues, Both locations would have had Olympic villages. In the district of Berchtesgadener Land, located in close proximity of the border to Salzburg, Austria, the historic Koenigssee Sliding Center was renovated for the World Championships in 2011 for hosting bobsleigh, luge and skeleton.\nThe Green Party and several ecological associations opposed the bid. Arguments included the lack of natural snow, the environmental costs of artificial snow, using green land for temporary sites, road construction projects that would have caused a lasting increase of transit traffic, the financial risk, and the imposition of unnegotiable clauses by the IOC. As these points received increasing attention, public support for the bid diminished. While a 2009 poll gave 75.5% support of Munich residents and 68% across Germany, in spring 2010 these numbers were down to 69% and 64%, respectively. The bid proved highly divisive in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where more than 50 farmers refused to allow the use of their grounds. Before, similar refusal of farmers to cooperate had forced the planners to abandon Oberammergau as site of the Nordic competitions. As a replacement, a state-owned stud near Ohlstadt was chosen, which is located 200 meters lower than Oberammergau and more often than not is snow free in February.\nOn February 22, 2011, land owners in Garmisch-Partenkirchen supporting the 'Nolympia' initiative began collecting signatures under efforts to force a vote to decide whether the town would back the bid. \"The Olympic Winter Games are too big for Garmisch-Partenkirchen. With more than fifty events in the snow cluster there are almost five times as many events as the world ski championships,\" said Nolympia backer Axel Doering. \"Our goal is to win a referendum, so that the contracts be reviewed. Another goal is to finally show that the alleged \"huge majority\" [of support] for the Olympic Winter Games is a myth,\" he added. Munich's bid plans called for the leasing of land from private land owners for the Games. The then-German Olympic committee President Thomas Bach said complaints by landowners in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were not a problem for the bid. \"It's not a problem at all because for the field of play, it's one piece of land with 800 square meters. The piece of land was there for the alpine world championships six weeks before,\" said Bach. He added \"we have seen this at the world championships they were all going down on this very slope and they will go down in 2018, hopefully.\"\nOn February 28, 2011 the IOC evaluation commission traveled to Munich and to the other cities, in which competitions would be held. The 1972 Olympic Stadium in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was the high point of the IOC's tour. IOC Evaluation Commission chair Gunilla Lindberg said her inspection team had \"absolutely felt the atmosphere and passion\" for the Olympics at the end of its four-day inspection of the Munich bid. \"The general impression is that it is a strong bid with strong governmental support. It is a good team on the bid committee and Germany is a big winter sports country used to organizing competitions.\" The then-IOC vice-president Thomas Bach insisted that 2018 was a good time for the IOC and Olympic Movement to bring the Games to the traditional winter sports city of Munich to \"recharge the batteries after having been to new regions, with 2014 to Sochi and 2016 to Rio\". German chancellor Angela Merkel said Munich had a \"very good chance\" of winning the race to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. She added, \"The world can look forward to Germany hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games 2018.\"\nIn addition to its historical strength as a passionate winter sports nation, figure skating superstar Katarina Witt promoted the bid, as well as 2010 Winter Olympics star alpine skier Maria Riesch and Olympic champion Bavarian biathlete Magdalena Neuner.\nWithin the IOC, Munich had a strong ally with IOC vice president Thomas Bach, whom, it was thought, could swing the vote to Munich, even though the 2014 Games will have been held in Europe as well. Nevertheless, Munich was already considering a bid for 2022 even before the 2018 bid failed.\nOrganizers budgeted US$42 million for the bid and US$331 million for venues with $143 million budgeted for an ice hockey arena. $743 million was allotted for new and planned transportation improvements.\nThe slogan of the Games was \"Die Spiele im Herzen\" (The games at heart) and it was also being tagged as \"the friendly Games\". The logo was a stylized M, reminiscent of the Bavarian mountain silhouettes as well as the awnings in Munich's Olympic Park.\nFollowing the 2018 loss, Germany considering to focus for the 2036 Summer Olympics bidding with the capital city of Berlin currently in talks with Israel's Tel Aviv over possible joint bidding to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nPyeongchang.\nAfter losing the bids for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, Gangwon Province Governor Jin-sun Kim announced in September 2007 that Pyeongchang would bid a third time. He cited increased knowledge of the bidding process and the enthusiasm of residents as reasons to keep trying. According to a survey by \"The Chosun Ilbo\" on December 23, 2009, 91.4% of Koreans, 93.4% of Pyeongchang and Jeongseon residents, and 93% of Gangwon residents supported the 2018 Winter Olympics bid. Cho Yang-ho, Chairman of Hanjin Group, was appointed as the bid committee chairman in 2009, and successfully won the bid in 2011. South Korea's figure skating superstar and 2010 Olympic champion Kim Yuna and IOC member and Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee promoted the bid.\nThe Samsung Chairman and principal owner Lee Kun-hee, given a 3-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and illegal bond dealing, was reportedly pardoned by the South Korean president Lee Myung-bak with the hope that his connections and financial support would boost the chances of Pyeongchang.\nOn February 16, 2011, the IOC Evaluation Commission arrived in Korea for inspection of Pyeongchang's bid. \"We have seen great progress in the bid from the two previous bids,\" commission chairwoman Gunilla Lindberg said. \"We have also seen progress in Korean winter sports during the last four years.\" Speaking at the IOC news conference following the inspection of Pyeongchang and venues in Gangwon Province, Lindberg said \"I must also mention the passionate support of Gangwon residents. During our site visits it has been wonderful to see so many people to show their support to bring the Olympic Movement to Korea.\"\nSeven venues had been built since the previous bids, including ski jumping slopes, and biathlon and cross-country skiing courses. Pyeongchang would be a compact Olympic Games, with travel times of less than 30 minutes between the main accommodation in Alpensia resort and the venues and 10 minutes between venues. A new 250 km per hour KTX line will be built between Seoul and Wonju via Pyeongchang putting Pyeongchang within 50 minutes of Seoul.\nGerman reporter Dietmar Gessner from \"Sport Bild\" said that \"in Asia including Korea you can create more customers. You can make lots of money for winter sports.\"\nPyeongchang's slogan is “New Horizons.” The bid's logo suggests the winter scenery of Pyeongchang with snow on the mountains. The curve implies a will to win and symbolizes a snowboard and slope of winter sports.\nVotes results of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics.\nPyeongchang's first round victory was one of the most decisive victories in Olympic voting history. Pyeongchang's 63 vote count is the highest votes ever recorded for a first round bid for a hosting of an IOC Olympic Game. The previous record was held by Salt Lake City with 54 votes for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\nPotential cities overview.\nThese cities launched bids or indicated interest, but ultimately did not bid to the IOC.\nAlmaty bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but did not make the short list. After the 2014 and 2018 failures, Almaty made an official bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but was surpassed by Beijing, China.\nThe Ukrainian government announced in 2006 that Ukraine's popular Bukovel ski and snowboard resort was expanding in expectation of a bid.\nLi Zhanshu, governor of Heilongjiang Province, expressed interest for Harbin, host of the 2009 Winter Universiade, or possibly Changchun. Xinhua reported neither city will bid due to a number of reasons including weak infrastructure. Ultimately, the capital city of Beijing would eventually win the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics in 2015.\nGap looked at the idea of a bid, but withdrew it in September 2008. The cities of Grenoble, Nice, and Pelvoux also expressed interest to the French Olympic Committee, but were passed over for Annecy. France will host the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the national capital. \nGeneva planned to launch a bid pending a public referendum, but the city decided to bid in 2022 instead. The Swiss Olympic Committee did not support the bid. Switzerland eventually hosts the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in Lausanne.\nA 2007 report indicated the New Zealand Olympic Committee suggested a bid for a combined Queenstown – Dunedin bid.\nThe new government did not show the same enthusiasm of bidding as the previous one. The political change was already made during a bid by the Swedish Olympic Committee. It would have been the eighth attempt at bidding in the Winter Olympics, after many bids finished as runners-up.\nAfter losing a bid for the 2010 games, the host of the 1984 Winter Olympics expressed interest in bidding for the 2018 games.\nVessela Lecheva, BOC chairwoman announced plans to have at least one project for a multifunctional hall in Sofia to improve chances after three failed bids.&lt;ref name=\"Sofia/Bukovel\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sofia also bid for the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics but lost to Lillehammer.\nTromsø beat Trondheim and the joint-bid Oslo–Lillehammer. The bid cost became contentious in Norway, National support was also low, with only 38% in favor of the bid; however bid head Petter Rønningen cited polls showing stronger support. Finally the application was withdrawn due to a lack of support. The cost for Tromsø games was assessed to much higher that the 15 billion NOK assumed at decision, since every arena would need to be new built or heavily rebuilt.\nBohinj mayor Franc Kramar proposed a bid with seven other mayors in Upper Carniola region.\nDenver (which voted not to host the 1976 Winter Games after winning hosting rights), Reno/Tahoe (host of the 1960 Games), and Salt Lake City (host of the 2002 Games) had expressed interest in hosting before the U.S. Olympic Committee declined to submit a bid. The United States will later host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nThere were initiatives to present Zaragoza. However, the mayor announced they would reserve the bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, reasoning it would be unlikely for Europe to be awarded due to the unofficial continental rotation policy, giving the failure of Madrid's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics as an example. The games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, became the first Latin American city to stage the largest sports event in the world.\nPredicting indices.\nTwo websites, GamesBids.com and Around the Rings, feature predicting indices which specialize in evaluations of Olympic Games bids. They periodically release analysis of the candidates and assigns them a score between 0 and 100, or 0 and 110 respectively. The score produces a number that can be used to rate a bid relative to past successful bids – and possibly gauge its potential future success. GamesBids.com's scale is called BidIndex, ATR's is called the Power Index.\nPowerIndex predicted that Munich would win, while BidIndex predicted that PyeongChang would win. Annecy was at a distant third, lagging behind 13 points in the BidIndex and 10 points behind in the PowerIndex. Ratings for the BidIndex are from April 2011 and rating for the PowerIndex are from June 2011."

        "text": "Clifton Randolph Pennington (born June 15, 1984) is an American former professional baseball infielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Angels, and Cincinnati Reds between 2008 and 2018. In 2021 he was hired as the baseball recruiting coordinator for the Dallas Baptist Patriots.\nAmateur career.\nA native of Corpus Christi, Texas, Pennington played college baseball for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies baseball team under head coach Mark Johnson from 2003 to 2005. In 2004, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named to the league's Hall of Fame in 2020.\nProfessional career.\nOakland Athletics.\nPennington was drafted in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft by the Athletics. On August 12, , he was called up from the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, and made his Major League debut that day against the Tampa Bay Rays going 0-for-3 in a 2–1 win for the Athletics.\nPennington would end his 2008 season with a .280 batting average.\nFollowing the 2009 spring training camp, he was returned to the River Cats.\nOn July 31, 2009, Pennington was called back up by the Athletics. He hit his first major league home run on August 5, against the Texas Rangers. He finished the 2009 season with 4 home runs, 21 RBIs, and a .249 batting average. He started the 2010 season in the starting role. He finished the season with 6 home runs and 46 RBI.\nPennington started slow in the 2011 season, averaging .160 in his first 10 games. On August 1, he left during a game against the Seattle Mariners, after having trouble moving his muscles in his face and moving his eyes. Later that day, Pennington was diagnosed with Bell's palsy, which paralyzes one side of the face and prevents him from controlling his muscles. Although Bell's palsy can last for days, weeks, or months, he was listed as day-to-day and only missed two games.\nNear the end of the 2012 season, Pennington had started playing second base after the Athletics acquired Stephen Drew from the Arizona Diamondbacks to play every day shortstop, also due to the demotion of second baseman Jemile Weeks. Pennington went to the post season for the first time in his career as the Athletics won the AL West in 2012. They were eliminated in the ALDS by the Detroit Tigers in five games.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn October 20, 2012, Pennington was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks with Heath Bell and cash considerations. Oakland received Chris Young and $500K from Arizona, and the Marlins received minor-league infielder Yordy Cabrera from Oakland. Pennington and the Diamondbacks agreed to a two-year contract worth $5 million on January 23, 2013. The contract was finalized on January 30.\nOn April 13, 2013, Pennington was ejected for the first time in his MLB career for arguing a correctly ruled strike three call made by umpire Jim Reynolds. In an 18 inning game on 24–25 August 2013 at the Philadelphia Phillies, Pennington walked five times, one shy of the Major League record. Teammate Tony Campana also walked five times.

Fernando Martin Vicente, former head of the Spanish Federation for Mentally Handicapped Sports, allowed athletes with no disabilities to compete at the Games in order to win the gold medal. The team at the centre of the row was the Spanish basketball team, who won the gold medal after beating Russia in the final despite fielding a team mainly composed of athletes with no intellectual disability.

He played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball from 1977 until 1982, primarily as an outfielder. He also played five seasons in Japan with the Kintetsu Buffaloes from 1984 until 1988. His cousin was former infielder Enos Cabell.\nAmateur career.\nDavis attended Compton High School in California where he played on the school's baseball team with Odell Jones, Reggie Walton, Gary Ward and LaRue Washington.\nProfessional career.\nBrewers.\nDavis was signed as an amateur free agent by the Milwaukee Brewers in 1972. After several years in the minors, he was called up to the Brewers in July 1977. He split time in the outfield and as a designated hitter for the next four seasons, being used at DH more often than any other Brewer between 1978 and 1980.\nPhillies.\nDuring spring training in 1981, the Brewers traded Davis to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Randy Lerch. Davis played some right field and also came off the bench as a pinch hitter 20 times.

Davis continued in the same role to start the 1982 season, but was soon on the move again.\nWayne Nordhagen and end of Major League Baseball career.\nIn June 1982, Davis would be traded not once, but twice, each time for the same player. At the June 15 trading deadline, the Phillies first traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Wayne Nordhagen. While the Phillies sent Nordhagen on to the Pittsburgh Pirates on the same day in exchange for another outfielder, Bill Robinson, Davis stayed in Toronto for an entire week, appearing in three games and going 2-for-7 at the plate. On June 22, the Blue Jays traded Davis to the Pirates for a player to be named later. On June 25, the Pirates sent a player to the Blue Jays — and it was Nordhagen.\nDavis struggled for the rest of the season in Pittsburgh, batting .182 in 77 at bats. Not a very good defensive outfielder, Davis needed to hit well to keep his job, and Pittsburgh wound up releasing Davis in March .\nJapanese career.\nDavis found a second career with the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Japanese Pacific League, who signed him for the 1984 season. While Davis hit a .310 with 18 home runs in 1984, he broke out in 1985, hitting 40 home runs, driving in 109 runs, and batting .343 in 128 games. During the season, he hit home runs in six straight games to tie a league record. He repeated his success in , batting .337. In 1987, he drove in nine runs in one game on April 28.\nDavis also had his share of troubles in Japan. In 1986, he charged the mound after being hit by a pitch by Osamu Higashio and was fined 100,000 yen. Then, in 1988, his apartment was raided by the Japanese police, who found 14 grams of marijuana and related paraphernalia. After three weeks in police custody, he was released by the Buffaloes and sent home to the United States, with Ralph Bryant filling the void left by his departure on the Buffaloes. Many have speculated as to how he had possession of marijuana, including neighbors racially ratting him out, and speculatory by some Buffaloes fans, rival team fans planting marijuana and/or ratting him out."

The club has been a professional cricket club and academy since 2000.\nAbu Mohammad Sabur (Jhilu) is the president of the academy while Arman Islam Nammu is the General Secretary, which is managed by Joint Secretary Tayeb Afzal and Manager Shahadat Hossain and coached by Sadiquzzaman Pintu. Its home ground is the Dhanmondi Road 4 cricket field.\nThe club was formed by residents of Dhanmondi.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nSince the late 1980s, the children's park located in Dhanmondi Road 4 was in the grasp of drug dealers, sex workers, hijackers, etc. and as time wore on, the situation got worse. There was a time in the early and mid-1990s when the local residents were afraid to venture towards that park even during broad daylight after several incidents of hijacking and murder.\nA slum developed and sex workers were usually seen residing in the park. The seesaws, slides and swings provided by Dhaka City Corporation became so rusted and inoperative that it was hard to find a single child in the park. Drugs were sold so rampantly, the parents of the area were scared even if their children were passing by the children's park at that time.\nEarly days.\nThe locals realised that the children's park would be lost and after taking permission from the local Ward Commissioner, the seesaws, swings, etc. were removed and some keen cricketers started practicing. Soon, DCA (a registered academy recognised both by the Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Cricket Board) was developed. In a roundtable meeting of \"The Daily Star\" few years ago, speakers lauded the efforts of this community. In 2002, the daily's senior reporter Morshed Ali Khan praised DCA on its work during a cricket tournament at the park in its sports page."

        "title": "History of rugby union in Scotland",
        "text": "Rugby union in Scotland in its modern form has existed since the mid-19th century. Scotland has one of the oldest rugby union traditions and has introduced various innovations including rugby sevens.\nAs with the history of rugby union itself however, it emerged from older traditional forms of football which preceded the codification of the sport. In the same manner as rugby union in England, rugby union in Scotland would grow at a significant rate to the point where Scotland played England in the first ever rugby union international in 1871, a match which was won by the Scottish team.\nIn 1883, Scotland would become a founding member of the annual Home Nations Championship with England, Wales and Ireland, (now the Six Nations Championship with the inclusion of France and Italy), and since its creation in 1987 have competed in every Rugby World Cup. Scotland took part in co-hosting the 1991 Rugby World Cup, alongside the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. The governing body of rugby union in Scotland, Scottish Rugby Union, is the second oldest organisation of its kind, having been founded in 1873.\nEarly history.\nEarliest rugby games.\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century the distinction between rugby football and association football (soccer) did not exist in Scotland so both codes share the same history.\nThere is a long tradition of \"football\" games in Scotland, and many of these such as Jeddart Ba' bear more resemblance to rugby than association football, since passing and carrying by hand play a large part in them.\nThe Kirkwall Ba game still takes place, and involves scrummaging. Scottish soccer enthusiasts also cite these games as ancestral to their sport, despite their greater similarity to rugby.\nUnregulated School rugby.\nSeveral new schools were formed in Scotland during the first half of the 19th century, among them The Edinburgh Academy (1824), Loretto (1827), Merchiston (1833), Glasgow Academy (1845) and Trinity College, Glenalmond (1847). It is known that unregulated forms of football were played at all of these schools, but it was in Edinburgh that the handling game first took root and spread to other areas of the country.\nCodified rugby comes to Scotland.\nEdinburgh Academy and the Crombies.\nTwo young men, Francis Crombie and Alexander Crombie, came from Durham School to Edinburgh in 1854. Francis joined The academy as a pupil but Alexander had already left school. Apparently, the boys brought the knowledge of football from Durham School and this they passed on. Francis is recorded as having been the first school football captain and Alexander became actively involved in the formation of The Edinburgh Academical Football Club. He qualified for membership under a rule which allowed relatives of school pupils to become members. In 1858 he became the first captain of the Football Club - a position he held for eight years.\nThe High School in Edinburgh and Hamilton.\nDuring the same period, a boy named Hamilton came to the High School in Edinburgh (in 1856) from an English private school and brought with him the 'Rules of Rugby Football' as he had known them from south of the Border. This document was instrumental in the High School's adapting their existing game to this new form.\nFirst ever Schools match.\nThe first-ever inter-school match recorded in Scotland was Royal High School versus Merchiston (in Edinburgh), played on 13 February 1858. However, the game suffered from lack of uniformity of rule and ball.\nStandardisation of rules.\nIn The High School, in the early 1860s, football was played with '...monstrous inflated globes of vast circumference and ponderosity...'.\nH. H. Almond, a master at both Loretto and Merchiston, and a founding father of the game in Scotland, describing an incident in a Loretto versus Merchiston match, wrote: '...but so little did any of us, masters or boys, then know about it, that I remember how, when Lyall ran with the ball behind the Merchiston goal the resulting try was appealed against on the ground that no player may cross the line whilst holding the ball. The previous rule at Merchiston had been that he must let go of the ball and kick it over before he touched it down. It must be said in excuse for this and other similar sins of ignorance, that the only available rules were those printed for the use of Rugby School. They were very incomplete and presupposed a practical knowledge of the game.'\nDisputes.\nGradually, over several years, the game approached that then being played at Rugby. There were local variations which, inevitably, resulted in disputes.\nH.H. Almond: 'well into the 1870s the only schools able to play each other on even terms were The Edinburgh Academy, Merchiston and The High School.'\nFrom the mid-1860s, senior (former pupils) clubs started to appear in both the Edinburgh and Glasgow areas and these clubs, making good use of the then new railways, began to play each other. In those early club matches play was often halted whilst captains and umpires tried to settle some point of difference. Such disputes and mix-ups were frequent.\nSuch a state of affairs could not continue indefinitely and a group of men from The Edinburgh Academical Football Club convened a series of meetings and, in 1868, with the agreement of the other schools and clubs, set out and had printed rules for the game in Scotland.\nThe Green Book.\nThe resulting booklet Laws of Football as played by the Principal Clubs in Scotland, became known as The Green Book. Alas, no copy survives but it is worthy of note that neither the clubs nor \"The Green Book\" felt it necessary to include the word 'Rugby' in their title. Indeed, the Scottish Football Union, formed in 1873, did not alter its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union until 1924 - the year prior to the opening of Murrayfield.\nOldest continual fixture.\nThe world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy, although the 'Edinburgh Courant' journal of Jan 1858 describes a Rugby Football match of December 1857 between sides representing 'The university' (Edinburgh) and 'The Academical Club' (Edinburgh Academicals FC).\n1871 to 1924.\nThe first ever international.\nThe first international rugby football game resulted from a challenge issued in the sporting weekly \"Bell's Weekly\" on 8 December 1870 and signed by the captains of five Scottish clubs, inviting any team \"selected from the whole of England\" to a 20-a-side game to be played under the Rugby rules. The notice itself was inconspicuous, being slotted in between other items.\nThe team representing England was captained by Frederick Stokes of Blackheath, that representing Scotland was led by Francis Moncrieff; the umpire was Hely Hutchinson Almond, headmaster of Loretto College. England played in all white, with a red rose on their shirts; Scotland wore brown shirts and white cricket flannels with a thistle.\nThe game was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, the home ground of Edinburgh Academicals, on 27 March 1871. The game, played over two halves of 50 minutes between 20-a-side, was won by Scotland, who scored a goal (a try followed by a successful conversion kick). Both sides also scored a try, but these did not count as the conversion kicks were missed. Angus Buchanan scored the try (the first in international rugby), and William Cross converted it. A points scoring system had not then been devised.\nIn a return match at the Kennington Oval, London, in 1872, England were the winners.\nThis is not only the first international rugby match but the first international of any form of football because, despite the fact that three England v Scotland fixtures had already been played according to association football rules in 1870 and 1871, these are not considered full internationals by FIFA as the players competing in the Scotland team were London-based players who claimed a Scottish family connection rather than being truly Scottish players.\nFirst Provincial match.\nThe first provincial rugby football match in the world was played on 23 November 1872 in Scotland. This was between Glasgow District and Edinburgh District and played at the Burnbank ground in Woodlands, Glasgow. Edinburgh won the match 3–0 in a 20 a side fixture.\nThis match became known as the 'Inter-City'. The Glasgow - Edinburgh match is still played today between the now professional provincial sides. Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby compete for the 1872 Cup in recognition of the first Inter-City fixture.\nOrigins of the SRU.\nThe \"Scottish Football Union\" (SFU) was founded in 1873.\nThe Calcutta Cup.\nThe Calcutta Cup was gifted to the Rugby Football Union in 1878 by the members of the short-lived Calcutta Rugby\nClub. The members had decided to disband: the cup was crafted from melted-down silver rupees which became\navailable when the club's funds were withdrawn from the bank. The Cup is unique in that it is competed for annually\nonly by England and Scotland. The first Calcutta Cup match was played in 1879 and, since that time, over 100\nmatches have taken place.\nScotland have won the Calcutta Cup 39 times. They compete in Six Nations Championship and have never won it, however they did win the last 5 nations championship in 1999 only narrowly missing out on a grand slam. Scotland have participated in every Rugby World Cup tournament.\nInternational Rugby Board.\nThe SFU was a founder member of the International Rugby Board in 1886, along with Ireland and Wales.\nLeft: The minutes of the first formal meeting of the IRFB, from a meeting attended by Lyle and McAlistair of Ireland, Carrick and Gardner of Scotland, Mullock and Lyne of Wales.\nEngland belatedly joined the Board in 1890. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa became full members in 1949. France became a member in 1978 and a further eighty members joined from 1987 to 1999.\nThe International Rugby Board is now known as World Rugby and oversees the administration of the sport.\nWorld Rugby organises the Rugby World Cups.\nLate 19th and early 20th Centuries.\nIn 1897 land was purchased by the SFU at Inverleith, Edinburgh. Thus the SFU became the first of the Home Unions to own its own ground. The first visitors were Ireland, on 18 February 1899 (Scotland 3 Ireland 9).\nThe Scots enjoyed periodic success in the early days vying with Wales in the first decade of the 20th century. However, their Triple Crown win in 1907 would be the last for eighteen years as the First World War (1914–18) and England intervened to deny them glory.\nIn 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union.\nInternational rugby was played at Inverleith until 1925. The SRU bought some land and built the first Murrayfield Stadium which was opened on 21 March 1925.\nInvention of Rugby Sevens.\nScotland has played a seminal role in the development of rugby, notably in \nRugby sevens, which were initially conceived by Ned Haig, a butcher from Jedburgh, Scotland as a fundraising event for his local club Melrose in 1883. The first ever officially sanctioned international tournament of rugby occurred at Murrayfield as part of the \"Scottish Rugby Union's celebration of rugby\" centenary celebrations in 1973. Due to the success of the format, the ongoing Hong Kong Sevens was launched three years later. In 1993, the Rugby World Cup Sevens was launched and the trophy is known as the \"Melrose Cup\" in memory of Ned Haig's invention.\nUnion-League schism.\nIn 1895, there was a schism within the game of rugby in neighbouring England which saw the sport divided into rugby union which remained amateur and rugby league which permitted payments to players. However, no such split took place in Scotland where the clubs continued to play rugby union. Fourteen Scottish players would cross over and play rugby league in England before amateurism was abandoned.\nWhile rugby league is not as popular as rugby union in Scotland, it has maintained a continuous presence for over a century in the country, thanks partly to its proximity to Northern England which is the heartland of the game.\n1925-1945.\nIn 1925 Scotland already had victories over France at Inverleith (25-4), Wales in Swansea (24-14) and Ireland in Dublin (14-8). England, the Grand Slam champions of the two previous seasons were the first visitors to Murrayfield. 70,000 spectators saw the lead change hands three times before Scotland secured a 14–11 victory which gave them their first-ever Five Nations Grand Slam.\nIn 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons.\nThe outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 brought rugby union in Scotland to a halt. The SRU cancelled all arranged trial and international matches and encouraged the member clubs to carry on as best they could. Some clubs closed down, others amalgamated and carried on playing other local clubs and, sometimes, teams from the armed forces stationed in their various areas.\n1946-1973.\nOfficial internationals resumed in the 1946–7 season. In the Spring of 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand and Forces team.\nThe period after World War II was not a successful one for Scotland. In 1951, the touring Springboks massacred Scotland 44-0 scoring nine tries, a then record defeat. Scotland suffered 17 successive defeats between February 1951 and February 1955, scored only 54 points in these 17 games: 11 tries, six conversions, and four penalties.\nThe teams from 1955 to 1963 were an improvement. There were no win over England, but three of the games were drawn and only twice was the margin of defeat more than a single. 1964 was a good year for Scotland New Zealand were held to a 0–0 draw, the last international match in which no points were scored. The Calcutta Cup was won 15–6, the first time since 1950 and they shared the Five Nations title in 1964 with Wales.\nIn 1971 the SRU appointed Bill Dickinson as their head coach, after years of avoidance, as it was their belief that rugby should remain an amateur sport. He was officially designated as an \"adviser to the captain\".\nScotland were the first of the Home Unions to run a truly nationwide club league. This was introduced in 1973 and still flourishes today with several of the country's original clubs still very much in evidence, such as Heriots, West of Scotland, Watsonians and the famous 'border' clubs such as Gala, Hawick, Jed-Forest, Kelso and Melrose. However the advent of professionalism saw Scotland's District championship abandoned and two (later three) 'Super Districts' formed, which have resulted in the top players generally being unavailable for their clubs. These teams play in international club competitions such as the Heineken Cup and the Celtic League.\n1974-2000.\nJim Telfer became national coach in 1980.\nScotland toured Australia and won the first test, which to date is Scotland's only away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides. After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment, with only one victory at Twickenham in the last match.\nThe 1983–84 season brought a draw with the All Blacks 25–25 in the late autumn and their second Grand Slam captained by Jim Aitken. Jim Telfer stood down after the Grand Slam to concentrate on his professional career as a school master. He was succeeded by his assistant, the former Hawick fly-half, Colin Telfer.\nScotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. Rutherford, the team's general and controlling influence, badly injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level and Scotland had to face New Zealand in the quarter-final. They lost.\nTheir greatest year in the modern era, however, was 1990 when, captained by prop David Sole, their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the \"auld enemy\" and hot favourites, England. Sole famously walked his men onto the field with quiet but steely determination, to the delight of the partisan home crowd. Scotland won 13–7, and with it their third Grand Slam.\nThe second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They went out to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were again beaten by New Zealand.\nThe third World Cup, held in South Africa, came around in 1995. The tournament followed a familiar pattern: a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury-time try, meant that, as second in the pool, they faced a quarter-final against New Zealand and were eliminated.\nProfessionalisation.\nThe SRU redeveloped Murrayfield Stadium, which is the main home ground of the Scottish national team starting 1993.\nRugby union became professional in 1995. When the Heineken Cup was suggested SRU officials were concerned that Scottish club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that Scotland's District teams might do better if they became centrally funded.\nThe SRU professionalised the traditional Districts of Glasgow District, Edinburgh District, South and North and Midlands as the respective provincial clubs Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby, Border Reivers and Caledonia Reds.\nIn 1996 these provincial professional clubs were given the go-ahead to take part in Europe. For the first two seasons, players were still released to play for their clubs in domestic competition, but eventually the districts became full-time operations.\nMany of the traditional rugby union supporters in Scotland have viewed professionalism as contributing to a \"loss of a golden age\", with some supporters mourning local and amateur players being replaced by hired professionals.\nThen financial difficulties – the SRU's high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield and this initial lack of support from traditional club fans – called for retrenchment. After two seasons, the SRU 'merged' the four teams into two. This resulted in short-lived name changes: Edinburgh merged with the Border Reivers to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers; and Glasgow merged with Caledonia Reds to form a team to be known as Glasgow Caledonians. In effect, though, the Caledonia Reds and Border Reivers sides were selected by the SRU to be disbanded in 1998; and this despite the Reds winning the 1996–97 Scottish Inter-District Championship and the Border Reivers district being the traditional heartlands of Scottish rugby.\nWith the establishment of the Celtic League tournament, the SRU felt confident enough to resurrect one of the disbanded districts. It chose the Border Reivers and in 2002 and they joined the second season of the Celtic League. The merged names of Edinburgh and Glasgow were then ditched, although Edinburgh briefly flirted with a 'Gunners' epitaph in 2006; and Glasgow formally adopted its warrior logo as an epitaph in 2005.\nIn 2004 international rugby games were played at Hampden Park in Glasgow and McDiarmid Park in Perth, as part of the SRU's campaign to reach out to new audiences outside the traditional rugby areas.\nUnfortunately the Border side was still unsustainable and it folded again in 2007. Establishing four professional districts once again remains a long-term goal of the SRU and the now likelier candidate Caledonia Reds will be re-established when the SRU believe financial circumstances permit.\nChanges in the professional era.\nIn 1996, the 4 newly professional Districts continued as before, playing in the Scottish Inter-District Championship which became a European Qualifying Tournament. The top sides were entered into the Heineken Cup, the bottom side was entered in the European Challenge Cup. This meant that the Scottish Exiles side was excluded from the professional Inter-District Championship as it could not represent Scotland in European competition.\nIn 1998, when the Caledonia Reds and Border Reivers folded, the SRU realised that Glasgow and Edinburgh needed more competition to become competitive. Overtures were made to the Welsh Rugby Union and a Welsh-Scottish League began in 1999.\nThe success of the joint venture between the SRU and the WRU eventually brought the Irish Rugby Football Union on board and a Celtic League was set-up in 2001 with Scottish, Irish and Welsh sides. It ran in parallel with the Welsh-Scottish League for its first season, but fixture congestion prompted the ending of the Welsh-Scottish competition in favour of the expanded tournament.\nA brief cup competition, the Celtic Cup was also tried, but again this ended due to fixture congestion.\nThe Celtic League was further extended with the introduction of Italian professional sides. This resulted in another name change and the professional league became known as the Pro12. After two South African teams joined in 2017, the competition was renamed the Pro14.\nGlasgow Warriors became the first Scottish side to win a professional trophy in season 2014–15.\nInto the 2000s.\nThe new millennium.\nScotland also won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with some dashing displays of 15-man rugby and to a last minute win by Wales over England, but that year's World Cup ended the usual way, with a quarter-final defeat by New Zealand.\nThey endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games including a humiliating 34–20 defeat to a debuting Italy. In their last game they managed a 19–13 win under captain Andy Nicol over an unbeaten England at a rain-soaked Murrayfield\n2003 season &amp; the future.\nAfter a poor start in the Six Nations in 2004 in which Scotland did not win a single match and claimed the wooden spoon, things were believed to be steadily improving once again under the Australian coach Matt Williams, the first foreigner to coach the national team.\nDespite setbacks, many new and talented young players are coming through to the top level. Yet the record for 2004 was disappointing: Played 12, won 2, lost 10. Williams also attempted to introduce a controversial \"Fortress Scotland\" policy, whereby only those currently playing in Scotland were eligible to play in the national team. Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) is under new management, Chief Executive Phil Anderton (known as 'Firework Phil' for his pre-match entertainment spectacles) was leading the way back to financial solvency and implementing major reforms to reverse the decline of the game in Scotland, but he resigned in January 2005 after his boss David Mackay was forced to resign by the SRU's general committee. Since then, much effort and thought has gone into restructuring the way the game is governed in Scotland.\nUnder Frank Hadden.\nFrank Hadden, the head coach of Edinburgh Gunners (previously a PE teacher at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh), was appointed interim coach for the 2005 summer internationals against the Barbarians and Romania, winning two from two and instilling confidence in the national side again. On 15 September 2005, he was appointed national coach of the Scotland team up to and including the 2007 World Cup.\nIn the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20–16, and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France. Scotland also beat England 18–12 at home at Murrayfield on 25 February 2006 to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.\nIn the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders. In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress. A sound first half performance was squandered with an uncharacteristically poor defence in the second. Australia went on to win the game 44–15. The series provided a mixture of advances and setbacks. Scotland lost several key players through injury, notably captain Jason White who suffered a knee injury and missed the entire 2007 Six Nations Championship.\nScotland suffered a humiliating defeat on 24 February 2007 when they became the first Six Nations team to lose at home to Italy, 17–37. This was Italy's biggest ever victory over Scotland, home or away. After only six minutes of the match Scotland were already trailing 0-21, due to a clearance kick being charged down and two interceptions by the Italians. Man of the match was awarded to Italian Alessandro Troncon, who scored a late try to put the match out of reach.\nIn 2007, The Borders was disbanded yet again due to continuing financial difficulties. Also in the same year, the SRU began organising the Edinburgh 7s, the final event in the annual IRB Sevens World Series.\nLater that year, the side travelled to France for the rugby world cup. They fought their way through a difficult group and made it to the quarter-finals where they were knocked out by Argentina.\nDespite the promising World Cup, Scotland did not emerge in the Six Nations as the dark horses the media had predicted. Scotland opened their campaign at home but lost 27–6 to France. Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after round 2 as Scotland lost 30–15 to a rejuvenated Wales side who could have scored more. Scotland finally managed to score a try, against Ireland, despite losing. They didn't need to score a try against England however as they regained the Calcutta Cup with a 15–9 victory in a dull contest. Scotland scored two tries against Italy but lost thanks to a drop goal in the last minute to go down 23–20. Scotland managed to avoid the wooden spoon on scoring difference but it was a disappointing campaign. They then toured Argentina to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21-15 and won the second 26–14.\nScottish Sports Hall of Fame.\nThe following rugby players have been inducted to the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame:\nAlso Leslie Balfour-Melville (1854–1937), as an all-rounder, since he played many other sports."

        "text": "James McKeever (April 19, 1861 – August 19, 1897), was an American professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Boston Reds in 1884.\nEarly years.\nMcKeever was born in 1861 in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Irish immigrants. He moved to Boston with his parents at age three. He was boyhood friends in South Boston with Tommy McCarthy, who was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He graduated from the Lawrence School in Boston in 1875 and became employed by the Norway Iron Company.\nBaseball career.\nMcKeever played baseball \"as a business\" for several years for teams in the Boston area. \nIn April 1884, he signed with the Boston Reds in the Union Association. \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that McKeever was working at a South Boston foundry before signing his first professional contract with the Reds. \"The Boston Globe\" reported that he was \"a large man with no previous pro experience\" who would be positioned at catcher and serve as one half of Boston's \"change battery\" with pitcher Charlie Daniels. A biography of McKeever in \"The National Pastime\" described him as \"a strong defensive catcher\" who was \"unable to hit successfully against the suspect UA pitching.\" During his major-league career, he appeared in 16 games and scored 13 runs with a .136 batting average, before he was released along with Fred Tenney in August. \nMcKeever later played for several years for clubs in Biddeford, Maine (1885), Waterbury (1885), Minneapolis (1887), Eau Claire, Wisconsin (1887), Easton, Pennsylvania (1888), Haverhill, Massachusetts, Lowell, Massachusetts, and Oil City, Pennsylvania (1895). He also later played for the Boston-based clubs Woven Hose in 1890, the Whittentons in 1891, and Institute in 1893.\nHe played principally at the catcher position but also appeared as a right fielder, center fielder, and first baseman. He was described in the \"Star Tribune\" in 1887 as a \"fine back stop\" and an \"excellent thrower\" with endurance that allowed him to catch up to five games a week.\nPoor health led to his retirement as a player during the 1895 season. He thereafter served as manager of a semipro team in Boston.\nDeath.\nOn August 19, 1897, Mckeever died \"after an illness of five weeks of brain fever\". At the time of his death, the South Boston \"Bulletin\" called him \"one of the best known ball players about Boston.\" He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts."

He played five seasons in the majors, four for the Cleveland Indians and one for the Seattle Mariners, mostly in the outfield.\nSmith attended Lincoln High School and North Carolina State University, where he played college baseball for the Wolfpack. In 1969, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Canalmen of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.\nSmith was selected by the Indians in the third round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. He spent the next several seasons in their farm system, seeing only brief stints with the major league club in each season from 1973 until 1975. In 1976, Smith got his first real shot at big league playing time, playing 55 games and batting .256.\nPrior to the 1977 season, Smith was selected with the 58th pick (third round) of the 1976 MLB expansion draft by the Mariners. However, with the expansion team Smith saw very little time in the majors, playing in just 21 games, going 7-for-27 in his final major league season."

        "title": "Ancient Olympic Games",
        "text": "The ancient Olympic Games (, \"ta Olympia\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and were one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held at the Panhellenic religious sanctuary of Olympia, in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The originating Olympic Games are traditionally dated to 776 BC. The games were held every four years, or Olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule in the 2nd century BC. Their last recorded celebration was in AD 393, under the emperor Theodosius I, but archaeological evidence indicates that some games were still held after this date. The games likely came to an end under Theodosius II, possibly in connection with a fire that burned down the temple of the Olympian Zeus during his reign.\nDuring the celebration of the games, the \"ékécheiria\" (an Olympic truce) was announced so that athletes and religious pilgrims could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rival city states. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each Olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.\nThe ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate, although there were victorious women chariot owners. Moreover, throughout their history, the Olympics, both ancient and modern, have occasionally become arenas where political expressions, such as demonstrations, boycotts, and embargoes, have been employed by nations and individuals to exert influence over these sporting events. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate. The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations like the modern Olympic Games. Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.\nOrigin mythology.\nTo the Ancient Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology. During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.\nThese origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games. Greek historian Pausanias provides a story about the dactyl Heracles (not to be confused with the Hercules who was the son of Zeus and joined the Roman pantheon) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, who raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four-year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively). The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.\nAnother myth of the origin of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, had a daughter named Hippodamia, and according to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and therefore supernaturally fast. The king's daughter fell in love with a man called Pelops. Before the race however, Pelops persuaded Oenomaus' charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as a thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.\nOne (later) myth, attributed to Pindar, states that the festival at Olympia involved Heracles, the son of Zeus: According to Pindar, Heracles established an athletic festival to honor his father, Zeus, after he had completed his labors.\nThe patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.\nHistory.\nThe Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.\nPrehistory.\nAreas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians depicted athletic scenes in tombs of kings and their nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, and those events that occurred were probably the preserve of kings and upper classes. Minoans culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with bull-leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan games and also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies. Homer's heroes participate in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the \"Iliad\" there are chariot races, boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, archery, and spear throwing. The \"Odyssey\" adds to these a long jump and discus throw.\nFirst games.\nAristotle reckoned the date of the first Olympics to be 776 BC, a date largely accepted by most, though not all, subsequent ancient historians. It is still the traditionally given date and archaeological finds confirm, approximately, the Olympics starting at or soon after this time. \nArchaeology suggests that major games at Olympia arose not in 776 but probably around 700. Christesen's important work on the Olympic victor lists shows that victors' names and details were unreliable until the sixth century. Elis's independent state administered it, and while the Eleans managed the games well, there sometimes was bias and interference. Also, despite modern illusions, the famous Olympic truce only mandated safe passage for visitors; it did not stop all wars in Greece or even at Olympia. \nOlympiad calendar.\nThe historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated. The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using \"Olympiad\" for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316 BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765 BC for the first year of the first Olympiad. Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.\nAccording to the later Greek traveler Pausanias, who wrote in 175 AD, the only competition held at first was the \"stadion\", a race over about . The word \"stadium\" is derived from this event.\nEarly history.\nSeveral groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668 BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.\nIn the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to Olympia competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' roles.\nGreek sports also derived its origins from the concept that physical energy was being expended in a ritualistic manner, in which Paleolithic age hunting practices were turned into a more socially and glamorized function, thus becoming sport. The Greeks in particular were unique in the regard that their competitions were often held in grand facilities, with prizes and nudity that stressed the Greek idealisms of training one's body to be as fit as their mind. It is this ideology and athletic exceptionalism that resulted in theories claiming the Greeks were the inventors of sport \nOver time, the Olympic Games gained increasing recognition and became part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The other Panhellenic Games were the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games, though the Olympic Games were considered the most prestigious.\nImperial period.\nRoman conquest of Greece.\nAfter the Roman conquest of Greece the Olympics continued but the event declined in popularity throughout the pre-Augustan era. During this period, Romans largely concentrated on domestic problems, and paid less attention to their provinces. The fact that all equestrian victors were from the immediate locality and that there is a \"paucity of victor statues in the Altis\" from this period suggests the games were somewhat neglected.\nIn 86 BC the Roman general Sulla robbed Olympia and other Greek treasuries to finance a war. He was the only Roman to commit violence against Olympia. Sulla hosted the games in 80 BC as a celebration of his victories over Mithridates. Supposedly the only contest held was the stadion race because all the athletes had been called to Rome.\nAugustus.\nUnder the rule of emperor Augustus the Olympics underwent a revival. Before he came to full power, Augustus' right-hand man Marcus Agrippa restored the damaged temple of Zeus and in 12 BC Augustus asked King Herod of Judea to subsidize the games.\nAfter Augustus was declared a god by the Senate after his death, a statue of his likeness was commissioned at Olympia. Subsequent divine emperors also had statues erected within the sacred Altis. The stadium was renovated at his command and Greek athletics in general were subsidized.\nNero.\nOne of the most infamous events of Olympic history occurred under the rule of Nero. He desired victory in all chariot races of the Panhellenic Games in a single year, so he ordered the four main hosts to hold their games in 67 and therefore the scheduled Olympics of 65 were postponed. At Olympia he was thrown from his chariot, but still claimed victory. Nero also considered himself a talented musician, so he added contests in music and singing to those festivals that lacked them, including the Olympics. Nero won all of those contests, no doubt because judges were afraid to award victory to anyone else. After his assassination, the Olympic judges had to repay the bribes he had bestowed and declared the \"Neronian Olympiad\" to be void.\nRenaissance.\nIn the first half of the second century, the Philhellenic emperors, Hadrian and Antoninus Pius oversaw a new and successful phase in the history of the games. The Olympics attracted a great number of spectators and competitors and the victors' fame spread across the Roman Empire. The renaissance endured for most of the second century. Once again, \"philosophers, orators, artists, religious proselytizers, singers, and all kinds of performers went to the festival of Zeus.\"\nDecline.\nThe 3rd century saw a decline in the popularity of the games. The victory list of Africanus ends at the Olympiad of 217, though Moses of Chorene's History of Armenia lists a boxing winner from as late as 369. Excavated inscriptions also show the games continued past 217. Until recently the last securely datable winner was Publius Asclepiades of Corinth who won the pentathlon in 241. In 1994 a bronze plaque was found inscribed with victors of the combative events hailing from the mainland and Asia Minor; proof that an international Olympic Games continued until at least 385.\nThe games continued past 385, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia. The last recorded games were held under Theodosius I in 393, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.\nLocation.\nOlympia lies in the valley of the Alfeiós River (Romanized as Alpheus) in the western part of the Peloponnese, today around 18 km away from the Ionian Sea but perhaps, in antiquity, half that distance. The Altis, as the sanctuary as was originally known, was an irregular quadrangular area more than 180 meters on each side and walled except to the North where it was bounded by the Mount Kronos. It consisted of a somewhat disordered arrangement of buildings, the most important of which are the Temple of Hera, the Temple of Zeus, the Pelopion and the area of the great altar of Zeus, where the largest sacrifices were made. The name Altis was derived from a corruption of the Elean word also meaning \"the grove\" because the area was wooded, olive and plane trees in particular.\nUninhabited throughout the year, when the games were held the site became over congested. There were no permanent living structures for spectators, who, rich or poor, made do with tents. Ancient visitors recall being plagued by summer heat and flies; such a problem that sacrifices were made to Zeus Averter of Flies. The site's water supply and sanitation were finally improved after nearly a thousand years, by the mid-second century AD.\nCulture.\nThe ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him. Over time, Olympia, the site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon, was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece. The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of Zeus made of gold and ivory. It stood tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. As the historian Strabo put it,\nArtistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets, painters and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose. Pausanias claimed that the destroyed Sicilian polis of Naxos would have been completely forgotten if not for its four-time Olympic champion, Tisandros. Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games. His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.\nPolitics.\nPower in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th century BC. The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity. These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction. The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: on one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources. The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.\nThe spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630 BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.\nThe games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenic city-state. The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.\nDuring the Olympic Games, a truce, or \"ekecheiria\" was observed. Three runners, known as \"spondophoroi\", were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce. During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia. Legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce — primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games — was, for the most part, observed. Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the \"ekecheiria\". The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.\nWhile a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world. As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades, \nEvents.\nApparently starting with just a single foot race, the program gradually increased to twenty-three contests, although no more than twenty featured at any one Olympiad. Participation in most events was limited to male athletes, except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. Youth events are recorded as starting in 632 BC. Our knowledge of how the events were performed primarily derives from the paintings of athletes found on many vases, particularly those of the Archaic and Classical periods.\nCompetitors had access to two gymnasiums for training purposes: the Xystos for the runners and pentathletes, and the Tetragono for wrestlers and boxers.\nFor most of its history, Olympic events were performed in the nude. Pausanias says that the first naked runner was Orsippus, winner of the race in 720 BC, who simply lost his garment on purpose because running without it was easier. The 5th-century BC historian Thucydides credits the Spartans with introducing the custom of \"publicly stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic exercises. Formerly, even in the Olympic contests, the athletes who contended wore belts across their middles; and it is but a few years since that the practice ceased.\"\nRunning.\nThe only event recorded at the first thirteen games was the , a straight-line sprint of just over 192 metres.\nThe (lit. \"double pipe\"), or two-stade race, is recorded as being introduced at the 14th Olympiad in 724 BC. It is thought that competitors ran in lanes marked out with lime or gypsum for the length of a stade then turned around separate posts (), before returning to the start line. Xenophanes wrote that \"Victory by speed of foot is honored above all.\"\nA third foot race, the (\"long race\"), was introduced in the next Olympiad. Accounts of the race's distance differ; it seems to have been from twenty to twenty-four laps of the track, around 7.5 km to 9 km, although it may have been lengths rather than laps and thus half as far.\nThe last running event added to the Olympic program was the , or \"hoplite race\", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the games. Competitors ran either a single or double (approximately 400 or 800 metres) in full military armour. The was based on a war tactic of soldiers running in full armor to surprise the enemy.\nCombat.\nWrestling () is recorded as being introduced at the 18th Olympiad. Three throws were necessary for a win. A throw was counted if the body, hip, back or shoulder (and possibly knee) touched the ground. If both competitors fell nothing was counted. Unlike its modern counterpart Greco-Roman wrestling, it is likely that tripping was allowed.\nBoxing () was first listed in 688 BC, the boys' event sixty years later. The laws of boxing were ascribed to the first Olympic champion Onomastus of Smyrna. It appears that body-blows were either not permitted or not practised. The Spartans, who claimed to have invented boxing, quickly abandoned it and did not take part in boxing competitions. At first the boxers wore (sing. ), long leather strips which were wrapped around their hands.\nThe was introduced in the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC). Boys' became an Olympic event in 200 BC, in the 145th Olympiad.\nAs well as techniques from boxing and wrestling, athletes also used kicks, locks, and chokes on the ground. Although the only prohibitions were against biting and gouging, the was regarded as less dangerous than boxing.\nIt was one of the most popular events: Pindar wrote eight odes praising victors of the . A famous event in the sport was the posthumous victory of Arrhichion of Phigalia who \"expired at the very moment when his opponent acknowledged himself beaten\".\nDiscus.\nThe discus () event was similar to the modern competition. Stone and iron have been found, although the most commonly used material appears to be bronze. To what extent the was standardized is unclear, but the most common weight seems to be 2 kg size with a diameter of approximately 21 cm, roughly equivalent to the modern discus.\nLong jump.\nIn the long jump () competitors swung a pair of weights called . There was no set design; jumpers tended to use either spherical weights made of stone carved to fit the hand or longer lead weights. It is debated whether the jump was performed from a standing start or after a run-up. In his analysis of the event based on vase paintings, Hugh Lee concluded that there was probably a short run-up.\nPentathlon.\nThe pentathlon was a competition made up of five events: running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, and wrestling. The pentathlon is said to have first appeared at the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC. The competition was held on a single day, but it is not known how the victor was decided, or in what order the events occurred, except that it finished with the wrestling.\nEquestrian events.\nHorse racing and chariot racing were the most prestigious competitions in the games, due to only the wealthy being able to afford the maintenance and transportation of horses. These races consisted of different events: the four-horse chariot race, the two-horse chariot race, and the horse with rider race, the rider being hand picked by the owner. The four-horse chariot race was the first equestrian event to feature in the Olympics, being introduced in 680 BC. It consisted of two horses that were harnessed under a yoke in the middle, and two outer horses that were attached with a rope. The two-horse chariot was introduced in 408 BC. The horse with rider competition, on the other hand, was introduced in 648 BC. In this race, Greeks did not use saddles or stirrups (the latter was unknown in Europe until about the 6th century AD), so they required good grip and balance.\nPausanias reports that a race for carts drawn by a pair of mules, and a trotting race, were instituted respectively at the seventieth Festival and the seventy-first, but were both abolished by proclamation at the eighty-fourth. The trotting race was for mares, and in the last part of the course the riders jumped off and ran beside the mares.\nThe chariot races also saw the first woman to win an Olympic event, as the winner was deemed to be the wealthy benefactor or trainer that funded the team rather than those controlling the chariot (who could only be male). This allowed for horse trainer and spartan princess Cynisca to be the first female Olympic victor.\nDue to the winner being the benefactor, it was also possible for a particularly wealthy person to improve their odds by bringing multiple teams to the races; according to Plutarch, the record belongs to Alcibiades, who brought seven chariots to a single competition, winning the first, second, and either the third or fourth place at once.\nIn 67, the Roman Emperor Nero competed in the chariot race at Olympia. He was thrown from his chariot and was thus unable to finish the race. Nevertheless, he was declared the winner on the basis that he would have won if he had finished the race.\nOlympic festivals in other places.\nAthletic festivals under the name of \"Olympic games\", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.\nReferences.\nBibliography"

Proteas captain Graeme Smith saw it as his team's best chance to win a Test rubber Down Under: the bowling attack was globally vaunted, the fielding polished and the batsmen enjoying a particularly fecund run, Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla and Smith himself all having passed 1,000 Test runs for the year, while Ashwell Prince and AB de Villiers hovered around the 900 mark.\nAustralia, on the other hand, was still reeling from its two-nil Test defeat in India, although a clinical display against the touring New Zealanders assuaged some of their apprehensions: most notably, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin's sizeable hundred against New Zealand for once made seamless the void left by Adam Gilchrist's retirement.\nThe press duly built the series up as a must-see, but the players were far more reticent than they had been during the adjacent encounter three years before. Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. \"It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot\", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. \"If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. It's a bit the same with India last series. Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued over a long period of time.\" The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.\nSouth African allround kingpin Jacques Kallis arrived in Australia on the back of one of the worst batting troughs of his career. A little over a week before the First Test, journalist Robert Houwing observed that many of his countrymen had \"been ripping the proverbial fox to shreds: almost surreally, Kallis is the hound labouring at the rear of the pack. He shows just 519 runs from 13 Tests and 20 innings this year, at 28.83.\"\nSquads.\nFollowing injuries to Watson, Symonds, Clark, Krejza and Lee, Australia drafted in McDonald, Hilfenhaus, Bollinger and Hauritz.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nTeam selections: Shane Watson was named 12th man for Australia. South Africa's Ashwell Prince withdrew from the First Test team after suffering a broken thumb while batting in the nets. JP Duminy was chosen to replace Prince to make his Test debut.\nDay 1: Australia won the toss and elected to bat.&lt;br&gt;\nAfter a brief flurry of boundaries from Matthew Hayden, South Africa took three quick wickets - Hayden (12), Ponting (0, first ball) and Hussey (0) - to have Australia 3/15. Simon Katich (83) and Michael Clarke (62) then combined for a 4th-wicket partnership of 149 before both batsmen were out in the two overs before tea, leaving the home side at 5/166. After tea Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin pushed the run rate up towards 5 per over before Symonds was dismissed for 57, off 68 balls. Haddin (46) and Brett Lee (29) scored at a steady rate, and the day ended with Mitchell Johnson being out off the last ball of the day for 18. Jason Krejza remained 19 not out and Australia finished the day at 9/341.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa took a while to get used to the pitch before Makhaya Ntini took two wickets and Dale Steyn one within five overs in the morning session. The pitch settled down after lunch and only persistent bowling and poor shot selection produced the bulk of the wickets. Ntini finished with 3-66, Steyn 2-72, Morné Morkel 1-62, and Paul Harris 2-70.\nReports considered that honours were relatively even at the end of day one.\nDay 2: Australia's tenth wicket partnership put on 34 runs, and the team ended on 375. Morkel took the last wicket to finish with figures of 2-80.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa lost McKenzie for 2, but then consolidated until Amla (47) and Smith (48) fell close together and the score was 3/110. Kallis (63) and de Villiers (63) seemed to be in total control, and took the score to 234 without further loss. Mitchell Johnson then took 5 wickets for 2 runs in 21 deliveries with the old ball to have South Africa 8/243 at stumps. Johnson finished the day with 7-42. Krejza was the only other wicket-taker with figures of 1–102.\nDay 3: South Africa's last two wickets put on 38 runs to end at 281, with Johnson and Siddle taking one each. Johnson finished the innings with 8-61, the 8th best bowling figures in Australian Test cricket history. He might have taken nine, and the best figures ever, except that a skied top edge from Boucher (26) fell between Haddin and Lee in a mix-up between the fielders. Other wicket-takers: Siddle 1–44, and Krejza 1–102. Australia had a lead of 94 runs on the first innings.\nAustralia lost wickets regularly to reach 4/88. Katich (37) and Ponting (32) both got starts but were dismissed by determined bowling. A 60-run partnership between Clarke (25) and Symonds (37) was followed by three quick wickets. At 162–7 the match was evenly poised. Haddin (39*) and Krejza (28*) then added 66 runs to end the day with Australia at 7/228, and a lead of 322.\nSouth African wicket-takers: Kallis 2–19, Steyn 2–57, Harris 2–64, Ntini 1–55.\nDay 4: Australia's tail wagged for the second time in the match (putting on 162 runs for the last 4 wickets). Haddin (94), Krejza (32) and Johnson (21) all contributing runs and Siddle being at the crease for 37 minutes for his 4*. Haddin was the last out attempting to hit a six to reach his century, but was stumped by Boucher off Harris. Australia's total of 319 gave it a lead of 413.\nSouth African wicket-takers: Kallis 3-24, Harris 3-85, Steyn 2-81, Morkel 1-42, Ntini 1-76.\nSouth Africa started its run-chase slowly with McKenzie taking 52 deliveries to make his 10. Amla's arrival changed all that and he and Smith put on 153 for the second wicket in good time before Smith was out for 108 - his first score above 50 against Australia. Amla (53) was out shortly thereafter and the score was 3/179. Kallis (33*) and de Villiers (11*) saw the visitors through to stumps at 3/227.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-takers: Lee 1-40, Johnson 2-56.\nDay 5: Requiring 187 runs to win with a full day's play available, South Africa achieved the second highest successful run chase in Test cricket history, losing only the wicket of Kallis (57) on their way to 4/414. AB de Villiers (106*) and debutant JP Duminy (50*) put on 111 for the fifth wicket to take the visitors to victory.\nAustralia had a poor day in the field, taking only one wicket. Johnson 3-98 finished with 11 wickets for the match, while Lee was the only other wicket-taker with 1-73.\nSecond Test.\nTeam selections: Despite an injured knee Andrew Symonds was preferred to Shane Watson, who again was named 12th man. Australia also replaced Jason Krejza with Nathan Hauritz. South Africa named an unchanged side, after Ashwell Prince failed a fitness test on his cracked left thumb.\nDay One: Australia won the toss and elected to bat.&lt;br&gt;\nHayden (8) fell early before Katich (54) and Ponting (101) put on a 107-run partnership for the second wicket. Hussey went for his second duck in three innings before Symonds (27) and Haddin (40) got starts but didn't go on with it. Australia ended the day on 280–6, with Clarke (36*) and Lee (0*) at the crease. The Australian highlight of the day was Ponting's 37th Test century in front of a crowd of 63,263.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Steyn 2-61, Ntini 2-71, Harris 1-33, and Morkel 1-67.\nDay Two: Michael Clarke (88*) and the tail added a further 114 runs and Australia ended its first innings on 394.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Steyn 5-87, Ntini 2–108, Harris 1-38, Kallis 1-55 and Morkel 1-89.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa stated slowly and reached 141-6 when Boucher was dismissed. Smith continued his run of form with 62. Duminy (34*) and Morkel (21) helped the score to 198–7 at the close.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-takers: Siddle 3-24, Hauritz 2-49, and Johnson 2-53.\nDay Three: In a remarkable day's play South Africa reached 459 all out, after Duminy (166) and Steyn (76) put on 180 for the ninth wicket - the third highest all-time. Brett Lee didn't take the field all day due to a stress fracture in his foot, and Australia was left with three front-line bowlers and their part-timers.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-takers: Siddle 4-81, Hauritz 3-98, Johnson 2–127, and Hussey 1-22.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralia faced only 3 overs at the end of the day and finished on 4–0.\nDay Four: Only captain Ricky Ponting (99) and bowler Mitchell Johnson (43*) withstood the South Africa bowling as Australia was dismissed for 247 in their second innings. Ponting just missed out on a second century for the match which would have made him the only player to have done so four times. Steyn took five wickets to finish with ten for the match.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Steyn 5-67, Morkel 2-46, Kallis 2-57, and Ntini 1-26.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa were set 183 to win the match. At the close of play South Africa were 30–0.\nDay Five: Losing only captain Graeme Smith for 75, South Africa reached their victory target in 48 overs. This gave them a 2–0 lead in the series and their first ever Test series win in Australia.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-taker: Hauritz 1-41.\nThe fallout was significant: while the hosts were almost universally roasted, their opponents were lauded to the skies. Talk predominated around the forging of a new world order. \"This defeat doesn't mark the end of an era\", claimed Gideon Haigh in his blog for \"The Guardian\". \"The era had already ended. And the 13-year green and golden age in international cricket has really been a sequence of overlapping phases, subtly different, distinguished by key retirements: Taylor and Healy in 1999; the Waughs in 2003; Warne and McGrath in 2007.\" Calls for Shane Warne's return to Test cricket, omnipresent since his retirement in 2007, were now accompanied by calls for him to be given the captaincy in the impending Ashes as well. This was also the first time since 1992-93 Australia had lost a test series at home.\nThird Test.\nTeam selections: South Africa picked the same team for the third Test in a row. Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson were all omitted from the Australian team due to injury. Doug Bollinger and Andrew McDonald were included in the starting eleven, with Ben Hilfenhaus again being left out.\nDay One: Australia won the toss for the third time in the series and elected to bat.&lt;br&gt;\nAfter Katich (47) started strongly, Ponting was dismissed first ball for the second time in the series and Australia was 63–2. Hayden (31) and Hussey (30) both struggled, before Clarke (73*) and Haddin (38) came together at 162–5. Australia finished the day on 267–6, from 88 overs.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth Africa seemed flat in the field, with Clarke being dropped twice, but continued to take wickets at regular intervals.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Steyn 2-71, Kallis 1-43, Harris 1-44, Morkel 1-49, and Ntini 1-53.\nDay Two: Clarke (138) and Johnson (64) batted through the first session without loss - the first time Australia had done so for the series. Late hitting from Hauritz (41) and Siddle (23) lifted the total to 445 all out from 136.2 overs.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Harris 3-84, Steyn 3-95, Duminy 1–14, Kallis 1-54, Morkel 1-89, and Ntini 1–102.&lt;br&gt;\nIn reply, South Africa lost Smith retired hurt for 30 - with a broken left hand courtesy of a lifter from Johnson. McKenzie (23) and Amla (30*) were patient before Kallis (36*) lifted the scoring rate late in the day.\nSouth Africa finished on 125–1.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-taker: Siddle 1-21.\nDay Three: Johnson (2 wickets and a run-out) and McDonald (1 wicket) reduced South Africa to 193-5 (with Smith absent injured) before Boucher (89) and Morkel (40) put on 115 for the 6th wicket. Siddle then took 4–7 in 22 deliveries to have South Africa all out for 327. This gave Australia a lead of 118 on the first innings.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-takers: Siddle 5-59 (his first 5 wicket haul in Test cricket), Johnson 2-69, and McDonald 1-41.&lt;br&gt;\nIn reply, Australia were 33 without loss from 6 overs.\nDay Four: Australia aimed to set South Africa a victory target on the fifth day with Ponting (53) and Katich (61) getting starts. Hussey (45*) anchored the innings while Clarke (41) attempted to score quickly. The declaration at 257-4 set South Africa 376 to win.&lt;br&gt;\nSouth African wicket-takers: Morkel 2-38, Steyn 1-60, and Harris 1-63.&lt;br&gt;\nWith Smith absent injured Morkel (0) opened the batting with McKenzie. His demise gave Bollinger his first Test wicket. South Africa were 62–1 at the close. The pitch was cracked and showing uneven bounce. South Africa required a further 312 to win from 90 overs on the last day of the Test series for a 3-0 clean sweep.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-taker: Bollinger 1–11.\nDay Five: On a deteriorating pitch South Africa lost 3 wickets in each session to be all out for 272. Australia achieved victory with only 11 deliveries left in the match when Graeme Smith, batting for 17 deliveries and 26 minutes with a broken hand and injured elbow, was bowled by Mitchell Johnson. Besides the heroics of Smith, Ntini faced 75 deliveries, Steyn 65 and Harris 43 to get South Africa within sight of a draw.&lt;br&gt;\nAustralian wicket-takers: Siddle 3-54, McDonald 2-32, Johnson 2-49, Bollinger 2-53, and Hauritz 1-47.\nTwenty20 Series.\n1st Twenty20.\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat.\n2nd Twenty20.\nSouth Africa won the toss and elected to bat.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat.\nMidway through the game, someone threw an inflatable ball onto the pitch.

Australia got off to a poor start losing opening batman David Warner for 5.

Opening batsman, Shaun Marsh ably supported Ponting with a composed 73 from 103 balls."

        "title": "Association of Cricket Officials",
        "text": "The Association of Cricket Officials (ACO) is an organisation set up to represent and support cricket officials, especially umpires and scorers. It operates under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and is often referred to as the \"ECB ACO\" or similar. Current membership (as of March 2015) is \"near 8,000\".\nFormation.\nThe ACO was formed on 1 January 2008 as a result of members of the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers (ACU&amp;S) having voted in favour of their organisation amalgamating with the ECB Officials Association (ECB OA).\nWhen the association was formed, an Interim Board was set up to get the new organisation rolling. Roger Knight was appointed as Chairman of the Interim Board, and has remained the ACO chairman since.\nMembership.\nThe association has the following membership categories, with respective subscription rates, as of March 2015:\nFull, associate and junior memberships are for persons resident in England and Wales; EC membership is for those otherwise living in the European Union (and the Crown dependencies), and overseas membership is for remaining places in the world.\nFull, junior and EC members are those who are \"active\" in officiating in cricket – the association provides appropriate insurance cover as standard to these members (hence the higher subscription fees). Members officiate across the cricket spectrum from village cricket to Test cricket, including women's cricket.\nFull and junior members (aged 16 and over) must be certified by the Disclosure and Barring Service if active in England and Wales.\nCounty Associations.\nFor each ECB County Board there is an attached county ACO association. Members of the ACO residing in England and Wales are also a member of one of these county associations, typically the one where they live or are active in.\nCounties are then grouped into four regions (Midlands, London &amp; East, South &amp; West, and North), which are used largely as a forum for the county associations and to represent them on the national (England &amp; Wales) ACO Board.\nWales has a single ECB cricket board (called Cricket Wales) and therefore a single ACO association, which is also the (fifth) regional body.\nEducation programme.\nA new structure of cricket umpiring and scoring qualifications has now been put into place and the ACO provides training and examinations for these. Separate pathways (through the levels of qualifications) exist for umpires and scorers. Entrants to the pathways do not have to be ACO members, but to progress beyond Level 1 membership is a requirement.\nOld umpiring qualifications issued by the ACU&amp;S will be recognised as follows by the ACO:\nCurrent courses are as follows:\nA new education structure for both umpires and scorers is currently being phased in.\nBoard.\nThe association's Board as of 2014 consists of:\nThe Board has the following sub-committees:\nFurther notable officers of the association are:\nOfficial merchandise.\nThe famous Worcester-based cricket company \"Duncan Fearnley\" manufactures and retails clothing and accessories exclusively for the ECB ACO.\nOffices.\nThe association is registered at the ECB's head offices at Lord's Cricket Ground (Marylebone, Middlesex), but most administrative activity occurs at the ECB's offices at Edgbaston Cricket Ground (Birmingham, Warwickshire)."

        "title": "2005 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland",
        "text": "The 2005 New Zealand Rugby Union tour of Britain and Ireland was a Grand Slam Rugby Union tour played by the New Zealand National Rugby Union team, also known as the All Blacks, in the United Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland against their respective national teams. Played through November, it consisted of 4 matches against Wales, Ireland, England and Scotland.\nIt was the first Grand Slam Tour by the All Blacks since the 18 match Grand Slam tour of 1978.\nNew Zealand won all of their matches with a touring squad of 35 players selected by Head Coach Graham Henry. \nThe matches were played during November of 2005. The first match was against Wales on the 5th, the second was against Ireland on the 12th, the third was against England on the 19th, and the last match was against Scotland on the 26th to complete the first successful Grand Slam tour of the professional era. The last successful Grand Slam was by Australia in 1984 in between 14 other matches.\nTouring squad.\nA total of 35 players were selected for the touring squad: five props, three hookers, four locks, seven loose forwards, three halfbacks, seven midfielders and six back three-quarters, including five new caps. Graham Henry was Head Coach with Wayne Smith and Steve Hansen as his Assistant Coaches. Tana Umaga was named captain for the tour.\nTests.\nA total of four matches were played during the 2005 Grand Slam tour against the four home unions of Wales, Ireland, England and Scotland. The tour was played over four weeks, with one game each week.\nWales.\nWales were looking to beat the All Blacks for the first time since 1953, when they won 13–8 at Cardiff Arms Park. They came into the match and tour as the most recent Six Nations champions and the last of the Home Nations to agree to play the All Blacks on the 2005 tour. New Zealand came in after a successful British &amp; Irish Lions tour and another Tri Nations win.\nThe All Black coaching staff named three debutantes for the first test in Cardiff: Neemia Tialata and Chris Masoe were chosen ahead of regular starters Tony Woodcock and Richie McCaw, while Angus MacDonald came on for James Ryan for his first international.\nMatch summary.\nThe All Blacks started off their tour with a 41–3 victory over Wales in Cardiff on 5 November, the 100th anniversary of rugby between the two teams. Dan Carter was the standout player for New Zealand, scoring 26 points including two of the five tries by the visitors. Rico Gear scored the other three tries for his team. Wales took another loss to the All Blacks, having to wait another year until they could break their losing streak against them, winning 13–8.\nFirst half.\nBoth sides started the game a bit rusty, but the All Blacks quickly took control of the ball and position on the field, depleting the Welsh team of a chance at attack.\nNew Zealand struck first with an early penalty before Byron Kelleher lost the first chance for a try in the 16th minute of play. The halfback took a quick tap at halfway, running 45 metres through a gap before getting tackled downfield, failing to offload to the open Tana Umaga at his shoulder. Carter converted to be two from two and put the All Blacks out in front 6–0.\nWales also missed a chance for a try that had to be substituted for penalty because of poor play. Gareth Thomas made it happen with a nice break through a missed tackle to set up a ruck inside the All Blacks' 22-metre line. With players wide, an easy catch and pass game would have got them the try they needed but poor ball handling ended up with the penalty being called instead. First-five Stephen Jones converted it into points and decreased the deficit to a penalty's-worth, 3 points.\nRico Gear scored the only try of the first half after some nice all round All Black play. With the scores at 6–3 in favour of the visitors, Chris Jack took the ball from the line-out in Welsh territory and provided the ball to the backs. Umaga straightened and feed back to Carter who spread it to Mils Muliaina, it was an easy pass out to Gear after that who scored in the right hand corner. Carter converted the sideline conversion and put the All Blacks out to 13.\nWales gained confidence as the first half progressed but the Rico Gear try in the corner nine minutes from the half-time break gave the All Blacks the upper hand going into the second half.\nSecond half.\nThe All Blacks showed no signs of slowing down when they came out and scored two converted tries in the first ten minutes, both from Gear. Gear scored his second, set up by Carter, and third in the same corner as his first; his second came from a nice pass from Carter who put him through the gap and it was an easy run to the try line, while his third was as simple as his first two with some easy passing out wide where Gear got outside his man and scored another five-pointer. Carter converted and New Zealand secured the win with still half an hour to play with a 27–3 lead.\nWith the game all but over, both sides shifted down a few gears with scrappy play dominating much of the final half-hour. However, New Zealand were the ones who capitalised on it, when they scored their fourth try of the game, coming from a dominant play by Carter who broke an easy tackle and cruised down the line to score his 17th and, after the conversion, 19th points of the match. Yet, he wasn't finished, in the final minute of play Conrad Smith put a kick through for Umaga; Umaga won the race to the ball but went down with his challenger and popped the ball up to a supporting Carter who went in for his second try and then his fifth conversion of the night.\nCarter finished with 26 of the team's 41 points and the All Blacks started off their tour on the highest possible note.\nPlayer movement.\nBoth teams utilised all of their replacement players, bringing them on at some point during the match. Richie McCaw and Tony Woodcock were the two usual starters on the bench making room for run-on debutantes Neemia Tialata and Chris Masoe, while Angus MacDonald made his debut off the bench.\nIreland.\nIreland were looking for a historic first win over the All Blacks. Throughout the entirety of their test rugby back catalogue, Ireland had failed to register a single victory. The closest they had come was a 10–10 draw in 1973 at Lansdowne Road.\nThe All Black coaches named a completely different squad than their team that played against Wales with loose forward Sione Lauaki and prop John Afoa making their debuts. Afoa was selected in the initial squad for the Tri Nations earlier in the year but had to wait until the 2005 end-of-year tour be he got on the field. Richie McCaw was named captain while regular captain Tana Umaga was rested. They also named five forward replacements and only two back replacements.\nMatch summary.\nThe All Blacks' second test was as good as their first with good win over Ireland on 12 November. The score would have been a shutout, but a late try by Marcus Horan left the full-time score at 45–7. Two tries each to wingers Sitiveni Sivivatu and Doug Howlett and another 20 points contributed by Nick Evans helped the All Blacks to a perfect 2–0 start to their Grand Slam tour.\nFirst half.\nIreland struggled in the first ten minutes, unable to get out of their own half from the pressure the All Blacks applied. The result was inevitable as Sitiveni Sivivatu broke a tackle and scored the first try of the match in the ninth minute of play. Nick Evans converted and the All Blacks were up 7–0.\nAs possession switched between teams, New Zealand were the first to do something with it when stand-in captain Richie McCaw offloaded to busy halfback Piri Weepu for their second try. Evans missed the conversion, but a penalty five minutes later brought the All Blacks up to 15–0 26 minutes in.\nWith another penalty in the 35th minute, New Zealand gained a chance at a counter-attack off a kick from Ronan O'Gara that failed to clear the touchline. New Zealand soaked up the Irish pressure and gained possession, No. 8 Mose Tuiali'i broke down the right hand line, passed to Leon MacDonald who fed Sivivatu for his second and New Zealand's third. Evans converted and New Zealand went into half-time with a 25–0 advantage.\nSecond half.\nNew Zealand started where they finished off in the second half with Ireland trying to perform better than their poor first half when Nick Evans kicked two penalties in the first eight minutes from some disappointing play from the home side.\nA dangerous tackle by Ma'a Nonu on Gordon D'Arcy brought memories of the Tana Umaga \"spear tackle\" on Brian O'Driscoll in the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour and he was lucky to leave with just a warning.\nFive minutes after the tackle, winger Doug Howlett got the wide ball and scored what looked like New Zealand's fourth try of the night, but referee Jonathan Kaplan referred to the television match official and awarded Ireland a line-out instead, after it was determined his leg was out of bounds before the ball was grounded in goal. Ma'a Nonu was also called back after he knocked the ball on over the line. Howlett gained what he thought he had five minutes later with the first of his tries as the All Blacks spread it wide beyond Ireland's capacity, Evans converted and New Zealand were up 28–0.\nTen minutes from full-time Ireland took a quick tap and Shane Horgan scrambled over the line but was unable to ground the ball and they were awarded a penalty five metres out. Four minutes later, when the game was all but over, Howlett prospered from another period of prolonged New Zealand pressure and claimed his second try of the afternoon. Another conversion followed, and New Zealand were up by 45 points.\nIreland finally got on the board two minutes from full-time when Marcus Horan crossed the line from an Irish maul. David Humphreys converted, and the Irish left without the embarrassment of a whitewash.\nNew Zealand finished the game with a dominant performance, not letting Ireland in until the last minute, racking up their second win of the tour and halfway to their first Grand Slam tour since 1978.\nPlayer movement.\nNew Zealand used four of their possible seven substitutes, with Saimone Taumoepeau coming on to have his first run-out of the tour. Ireland used six of their subs during the game, with only Kieran Campbell not being used.\nEngland.\nEngland provided the toughest challenge yet with only four points separating the teams at the final whistle. England were the most recent team of the four 2005 opponents to beat the All Blacks with a 15–13 victory in 2003 at Westpac Stadium in Wellington.\nNew Zealand named the best team possible for the game with only seven of the players staying on from the last test against Ireland. Richie McCaw was a late replacement after copping a head knock in the previous test, he was replaced by Chris Masoe. It was marked and remembered by the three yellow cards referee Alan Lewis delivered to the All Blacks, who at one time were down to 13 men.\nAlong with Wales, England were celebrating 100 years of test rugby against the All Blacks, first playing on 12 February 1905.\nMatch summary.\nStaunch defence was a major factor in New Zealand's 23–19 win over England on 19 November in front of capacity crowd at a Twickenham Stadium going through a few developments. With 14 men for the better part of the second half, New Zealand kept the home team to just one try, running in two of their own and a total of 10 successful kicks at goal completing the scoring.\nFirst half.\nEngland dominated the early stages of the game, captain Martin Corry running in the first try five minutes in. New Zealand were penalised in their desperation to recover, and England opted for the line-out which got them to the All Blacks' 22-metre line. They completed the line-out and from the ensuing maul the home team scored their first and only try of the match. Charlie Hodgson converted the sideline conversion and the Twickenham crowd settled down to see how the All Blacks would respond.\nAs the two teams battled for supremacy in all areas it took five-eight Daniel Carter to make the break. Through a weak tackle by Corry on his own 22-metre line, Carter had a two-on-one. He managed to offload to his captain, Tana Umaga, who scored under the posts. Carter converted and the scores were equal 20 minutes in.\nAfter some tremendous defence from both teams, a penalty goal each saw the score move to 10–10 in which was an intensely fought battle, evident in the scrums where England, dominant in their match against Australia a week ago, were being given a much tougher test.\nAnother penalty by Carter after one missed by Hodgson left the All Blacks with a 13–10 advantage going into halftime after a tough, fast first half.\nSecond half.\nNew Zealand were immediately on the front foot five minutes after the restart with Daniel Carter making another break which set up a platform for Keven Mealamu to barrel over. With the conversion successful, New Zealand were out to a 10-point lead early on.\nAnother penalty each, and the score at 23–13, England sustained enough forward pressure to force Tony Woodcock to commit a yellow card offence in the 57th minute. England responded successfully with two penalties to Hodgson from some nice line-out and driving work by the forwards. The lead was knocked down to four points with a quarter of an hour left in the match with New Zealand still with 14 men.\nA couple of minutes before Woodcock was due to return, the replacement prop, Neemia Tialata, was sin-binned and, for a short while, New Zealand were down to 13 men.\nEngland were still unable to score any points though and with both sin-binned players returning, it looked like the All Blacks would be able to hold out for the last four minutes. However, with England threatening on attack, Chris Masoe was penalised for intentionally killing the ball and was shown the yellow card, giving the home team a shot at the win.\nDespite the player advantage, England could not create the opportunity to score the try needed for the victory, and New Zealand escaped with their toughest win of the tour.\nPlayer movement.\nNew Zealand received three yellow cards throughout the game, and were reduced to 13 men at one point. They also utilised all of their replacements except Andrew Hore. England only used one of their seven substitutes, with Matt Stevens coming on for Andrew Sheridan in the 74th minute."

        "text": "The 2009 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships were held 12–16 August 2009 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, on Lake Banook. The competition was organized by the International Canoe Federation (ICF). The Canadian city was selected to host the championships in October 2003 after having done so previously in 1997. Final preparations were made after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, with competition format changed for the first time since the 2001 championships. Four exhibition events for both paddleability and women's canoe were added. Sponsorship was local within the province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality. Media coverage was provided from Canada, Europe and the United States on the Internet, television and mobile phone. 669 canoeists from 68 nations participated at the championships themselves.\nGermany won the most medals with 18 medals and seven golds. Men's canoe's overall winner was Russia with seven medals (one gold, five silver and one bronze). In men's kayak, the big winner was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's kayak. Athlete comments ranged from disgust over the format adjustment made to the canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships will hopefully push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.\nWomen's Canoe events were introduced for the first time at an ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 2009 as exhibition events.\nExplanation of events.\nCanoe sprint competitions are broken up into canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.\nPreliminaries to the event.\nDartmouth was awarded the 2009 championships at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Madrid, Spain, on 23 October 2003.\nEvent format changes.\nAt the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a new program for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the addition of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men &amp; women), K-2 200 m TA&amp;A (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA&amp;A (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms or Trunks and Arms; LTA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms; and TA&amp;A – Trunks and Arms, or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.\nOfficial meetings.\nIn January 2009, ICF Secretary General Simon Toulson visited Halifax for three days and was impressed with the history of canoeing in the area and the development of future canoeists for Canada. Two public meetings were held in Dartmouth and Halifax on 24 and 26 March regarding the championships.\nFacility.\nDuring the end of 2008, Lake Banook had its canoe course upgraded by Dexter Construction Limited. Water that had been pumped out of lake ceased on 15 December 2008, allowing the lake to rise back to its regular level by February 2009. Cleanup, restoration and landscaping was completed in the spring of 2009. By May 2009, this construction included new concrete abutments at the , , , and finish points, debris and abutment cleanup, ten new lane wires, four new cross wires, and 800 new buoys. Starting gates were tested during the second national team trials held at the lake on 27–28 June 2009. Temporary grandstands for 20,000 spectators per day were also constructed.\nAdditional changes were for environmental reasons. This included the Halifax Regional Water Commission, Conserve Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia Environment providing water stations for athletes, spectators and volunteers to fill up reusable water bottles which were purchased on site. It eliminated 100,000 disposable bottles and of plastic waste. Dalhousie University's residence halls used energy efficient lighting and cleaning products. The university's cafeteria eliminated the use of trays, lessening food waste, energy consumption and daily water usage by . A buy local policy and delivery truck that ran entirely on vegetable oil fuel was also used.\nAccording to a 10 August 2009 press release, the staging area was at Birch Cove Park in Halifax. 669 from 68 countries competed at the championships with an estimated 100,000 spectators.\nSponsorships.\nThe Atlantic Lottery Corporation presented the \"Women in Canoe\" program that included 21 female canoeists from 12 different countries. Festival entertainment was sponsored by the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation, including a \"Concert on the Lake\" by Matt Mays on 14 August that drew 10,000 spectators.

The numbers in parentheses shown are for men and women who competed for each respective nation.\nRussia had the most overall attendees with 46 while Canada topped the number of women competing with 16.\nThe media guide listed 71 nations as participating, but seven nations listed did not compete (Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Montenegro, Nigeria, South Korea, Togo and Uganda) while four nations who competed were not listed (Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and Tajikistan).\nThe ICF sponsored ten athletes in a development program in Romania in early 2009 that allowed them to compete at the world championships. These countries included Algeria, Armenia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.\nCoverage.\nMedia coverage was provided by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Sports in Canada, Eurosport, and Universal Sports in the United States. Live results were provided onsite from the official website that was sponsored by Bell Aliant which ran 9 am to 4:30 pm AST on 13 August, 9 AM to 3:55 pm AST on 14 August, 8:44 am to 5:45 pm AST on 15 August 2009, and 8:30 am to 3:46 pm AST on 16 August.

Medals were presented in Mi'kmaq baskets for gold medalists, traditional European baskets for silver medalists, and in traditional African Nova Scotian baskets for bronze medalists. Mi'kmaq is a territory in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada prior to the settlement by the French in the 17th century. The settlement was rotated between the French and British between 1627 and 1755 before the British took over the area after the French and Indian War. Africans settled in Nova Scotia during the Atlantic slave trade that ran from the 16th to 19th centuries. The closing ceremonies on 16 August included passing the ICF flag from Dartmouth to the 2010 world championship hosts in Poznań.\nFestival performances.\nFestivals for all four days started 30 minutes before the first race and ended 30 minutes after the last race each day. Live entertainment took place each of the days along with vendors, displays and exhibits. Boating safety was discussed along with interactive exhibits on canoe construction and allowing to touch live animals from around the world, including tarantulas and a -long python.\nResults.\nThe preliminary draw was released on 9 August.

Azerbaijan won a complete set of medals in the canoe discipline while Uzbekistan won its first ever gold medal at the championships.\nKayak.\nGermany won five medals in the men's kayak. Ronald Rauhe's three medals for Germany at these championships pushed his career total to 20, tying him with Torsten Gutsche (East Germany-Germany: 1989–99). Belarus won four golds with Vadzim Makhneu and Raman Piatrushenka each winning four of those golds.\nWomen's.\n Non-Olympic classes\nKayak.\nHungary medaled in all nine events with Natasa Janics and Katalin Kovacs each winning five medals.

Bridgette Hartley's bronze medal in the K-1 1000 m event was the first for both South Africa and Africa at the world championships. Josefa Idem's bronze in the K-1 500 m event makes her the oldest medalist in the history of the championships.\nExhibition.\nWomen's canoe.\nHost nation Canada won all four of the exhibition events. Jenna Marks won three of these events (C-1 200 m, C-2 200 m, C-2 500 m). Other nations with top three finishes included Brazil, Ecuador, Great Britain and the United States. How about Russia?\nPaddleability.\nItaly had four top three finishes to lead all nations in this event while the United States was second with three.\nAftermath.\nAthlete comments.\nAustralia's Wallace commented that he was upset at the ICF's decision that was made during the championships to replace the men's 500 m events (C-1, C-2, K-1 and K-2) at the Summer Olympics with the 200 m events (men's C-1, K-1 and K-2; and women's K-1) for the upcoming Summer Olympics in London. Kovacs of Hungary stated that the addition of the women's K-1 200 m event for the 2012 Olympics will not change her training routine. Italy's Idem, who was competing in her 20th world championships, stated that she was just as \"...nervous when ...[she]... was a 13-year-old girl (1977) and ...[she was]... the same today.\" Germany's Rauhe expressed his love for Canada by \"...going on holiday now.\" in the host nation.\nPaddleability's (Paracanoe's) future.\nIn a 25 August 2009 ICF article, ICF Canoeing for All Committee and Canoe Kayak Canada's Domestic Development Director John Edwards thanked efforts of the paddlers involved in the paddleability events for the 2009 championships. Edwards stated that the efforts for paddleability's success are twofold. The first is for inclusion into the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. Once this is recognized, the next goal is to get Special Olympic programs at a national level for inclusion into the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, other participants included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.\nMedal table.\nShown for the non-exhibition events only."

        "text": "The 2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships were held 19–22 August 2010 in Poznań, Poland, on Lake Malta. This was the third time that the Polish city hosted the championships, having done so previously in 1990 and 2001. Paracanoe (formerly paddleability) and the women's C-1 200 m events that were exhibition events at the previous world championships in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, became official events at these championships.\nGermany and Hungary won the most medals at the championships with twelve each though the Hungarians won six golds, the most of the championships, compared to the Germans' five golds. Brazil, Japan and Tahiti won their first ever championship medals. Ronald Rauhe of Germany became the winningest medalist in men's kayak with his 21st career medal, earning that in a K-1 200 m silver. Rauhe eclipsed that record he had tied at the previous championships with fellow German Torsten Gutsche. In women's kayak, Hungary's Katalin Kovács tied Germany's Birgit Fischer for most career medals with 38 with three medals earned though Kovács 29th gold passed Fischer's 28 career golds. For the first time since 1975, a tie occurred in the medals only this time it was for the bronze in the C-1 200 m event between Canada's Richard Dalton and Ukraine's Yuriy Cheban. Canada also won the first gold medal in women's canoe with Laurence Vincent-Lapointe winning gold. Paracanoe's big winners were Brazil and Canada with three medals each.\nExplanation of events.\nCanoe sprint competitions are broken up into Canadian canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.\nPreliminaries to the event.\nPoznań was awarded the 2010 championships at an ICF board of directors meeting in Madrid, Spain, on 23 October 2003.\nEvent format changes.\nAt the 2009 ICF board of directors meeting in Windsor, Berkshire, England, women's C-1 200 m was added for these championships while women's C-2 500 m will remain a demonstration event like it had the previous championships. The relay events, started at the previous championships, and 5000 m events, included for the first time since their discontinuation after the 1993 championships in Copenhagen, will also occur. Paracanoe (formerly referred to as paddleability) will have four events covering three classifications with LTA (Legs, Trunk, and Arms), TA (Trunk and Arms), and A (Arms only). The events were confirmed following successes at the previous world championships on 18 December 2009. The schedule for the championships was released on 10 June 2010.\nVisit from the ICF.\nDuring the week of 1 March 2010, the ICF visited Lake Malta to meet with the Host Organizing Committee (HOC) to see how event preparations were progressing. Some items discussed were broadcasting, event promotion, athlete services, and communications. 2.5 hours of live television coverage on a daily basis is planned for the semifinal and final event as provided in the contract to meet the needs of the European market. 61 million people watched last year's championships in Canada. ICF Secretary General Simon Toulson expressed his support of the HOC and his hope that the 2010 championships will be a good one.\nEvent progress.\nAfter opening ceremonies on the 18th, the first round of events took place on the 19th with 1000 m events completing their heats and the semifinals. Paracanoe heats were suspended later that day to high winds and weather conditions.\nParticipating nations.\n75 nations were listed on the preliminary entry list. The numbers in parentheses shown are for those who competed for each respective nation.\nRussia had the most overall attendees with 42.\nThe media guide listed 75 nations as participating, but four nations listed did not compete (India, Iraq, Malta, Malaysia).\nResults.\nMen's.\n Non-Olympic classes\nCanoe.\nRussia won the most medals with four. The people with the most medals were two with Ivan Shtyl (Russia), Alexandru Dumitrescu (Romania), Victo Mihalachi (Romania), Vadim Menkov (Uzbeskistan), Dzianis Harasha (Belarus), Ronald Verch (Germany), and Paweł Baraszkiewicz (Poland). For the second time in the history of the championships, a tie occurred for a medal in the C-1 200 m bronze between Canada's Richard Dalton and Ukraine's Yuriy Cheban. The first occurred thirty-five years earlier, in the K-1 1000 m gold between Italy's Oreste Perri and Poland's Grzegorz Śledziewski.\nKayak.\nGermany and Great Britain were the big medal winners with four each. Germany won the most golds with two. Ronald Rauhe won his record twenty-first world championship medal, eclipsing the record he tied last year with fellow German Torsten Gutsche. Ten canoeists each won two medals from five different countries.\nWomen's.\n Non-Olympic classes\nCanoe.\nThe first women's event was won by Canada's Laurence Vincent-Lapointe.\nKayak.\nHungary was the big medal winner, medaling in all nine events including six golds. The big individual winner was Natasa Janics of Hungary with five (three gold, two silver). Her teammate Katalin Kovács, won three medals to bring her career total to 38, matching that of Germany's Birgit Fischer though Kovacs did break Fischer's career gold medal count to 29, eclipsing Fischer's 28. Japan earned their first medal at the championships with Shinobu Kitamoto's bronze in the K-1 200 m event.

        "title": "2011 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships",
        "text": "The 2011 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships was the thirty-ninth edition of the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, that took place between 17 and 21 August 2011 in Szeged, Hungary. The Southern Hungarian city welcomed the world event for the third time, having hosted the championship previously in 1998 and 2006. These championships were awarded initially to Vichy, France, however, the race course on the Allier proved to be inadequate to hold the competition and the French Canoe Federation withdraw from organizing the event, following that Szeged, the original host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, was moved up to 2011.\nOriginally 94 nations have indicated their intention to participate on the championship, from them 88 registered officially for the competition, which was the main qualification event for the 2012 Summer Olympics, since 176 of the 248 Olympic quotas were distributed in this fixture.\nGermany and Russia topped the overall medal count with 11 medals each, and the Central European country won also the tied-most gold medals together with Hungary. The joy of the Germans was only overshadowed by an anthem mishap, as for their first gold medalists, Anne Knorr and Debora Niche the first verse of the national hymn was played, which is associated with the crimes of the Nazis and is not used since 1952. The organizers asked to be excused, which the head of the German Canoe Federation accepted, assuming no intent. Azerbaijani trio Sergiy Bezugliy, Maksim Prokopenko and Valentin Demyanenko collected three medals each in the men's events, while Max Hoff of Germany became the winningest canoeist with two World Championships titles. In the women's competition Hungary's Danuta Kozák was the most successful racer with two gold and a silver medal. Kozák's partner in K-2, Katalin Kovács claimed her thirty-ninth and fortieth World Championship medal and surpassed Birgit Fischer's record of 38.\nVenue.\nThe races were held in the Maty-ér, also known as the National Kayak-Canoe and Rowing Olympic Centre, an artificial reservoir which is situated two kilometres south of Szeged. It consist a 2400 metres long and 122 metres wide race track with nine lanes and a warm-up course, and is equipped with an automatic starting system and an electric time keeper with photo finish camera to meet all the criteria of the International Canoe Federation.\nIn preparation for the championship, the facilities of the Maty-ér were upgraded to become a state of the art sports complex. The Hungarian government allocated 450 million HUF (approximately $2.4 million) for the procedure, in which the whole sports center became accessible for disabled people, what was an important factor, since paracanoeists also participate in the competition. There was also constructed an 11,000-seat tribune, and the VIP-building together with the finish tower was also redeveloped. New racks were installed as well to be able to store the increased number of boats, and new catamarans were put into operation to assist the smooth conduct of the competition. Moreover, LED displays were erected on the island that divides the race course and the warm-up area, and two 36-meter-high cranes were set up, which hold and move the spidercams above the water. The complete refurbishment was finished and the facilities were delivered on 9 August 2011, eight days prior to the beginning of the championship.\nPreliminaries to the event.\nHost selection.\nIn October 2007, on the congress meeting of the International Canoe Federation in Guatemala City the organization rights of the World Championships were given to Vichy, beating the bids of Athens and Szeged. The regatta course in Vichy is on a natural river, which quality is highly influenced by the weather conditions. On the 2010 World Cup events a heavy water flow was experienced on the Allier River making the racing unequal. A number of competitors, including Olympic medalists Josefa Idem and Ken Wallace expressed their concerns and dissatisfaction with the track, following that the International Canoe Federation had to reconsider its decision. In early July, after a deep analysis of the situation, being aware of the possible inequity and unfairness on a major Olympic qualification event, the French Canoe Federation with the consent of the International Canoe Federation desisted from organizing the event. On 25 July 2010 the executive committee of the International Canoe Federation awarded the vacant place in its meeting in Lausanne to Szeged, which came second behind Vichy in the official candidating process, and was originally scheduled to host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships.\nSponsorships.\nThe naming sponsor of the event is the petrolchemical concern MOL Group, which actively supports sports in Hungary since years, having a prominent role in ice hockey, fencing, tennis and canoeing. MOL was the main sponsor of the 2006 ICF World Championships and for years it has been the naming sponsor of the MOL World Cup, which is one of the most acknowledged regattas in the world. The official supplier of the championship is SEAT, while Magyar Telekom enters the sponsors' list as the exclusive telecommunications partner. They are present in the competition with a wide range of services, such as LAN, WLAN, 3G and IPTV, providing internet terminals for the usage. Allee Center hosts the related official events, press conferences and promotional programs. Among the media partners are a number of online and offline newspapers (Délmagyarország, Figyelő, Index.hu, IPM, Nemzeti Sport, Szabad Föld) as well as radio stations, including regional transmitter Rádió 88 and nationwide broadcasters Rádió 1 and mr1-Kossuth Rádió. Other sponsors are EDF DÉMÁSZ, ESMA Group, Hunguest Hotels, MKB Bank, Rauch, RiverRide, Theodora, Volán and Weltauto.\nCoverage.\nThe media coverage was directed by the Hungarian Television and was taken over by 80 broadcasters, including ARD, rbb, BBC, RAI and global sports channel Eurosport. Live streaming on the official website of the event was also available. The World Championships were the first ever canoeing event, where the spidercam was used, giving a three-dimensional view of the course and making the races more lively for television viewers. 420 accredited press members were present throughout the competition, among others from Associated Press (AP), Agence France-Presse (AFP), Reuters and Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA). The event organizers also had a pioneer role in using social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs to extend the event's reach. Live results were provided by Sportline Ltd and could be reached from the official site of the event. Ovi came out with a free mobile application called \"Canoe 2011\", with that one could be continuously informed about the results and the latest news, both in English and Hungarian.\nJosé Perurena, president of the International Canoe Federation expressed his satisfaction with the coverage on the closing press conference of the event, having emphasized the records that were set in the World Championship: \"I'm absolutely content. The finals over the weekend took place in front of a crowd of 15,000 people, and more than 400 correspondents reported from the event, both are record numbers in the history of canoeing.\" Perurena also highlighted the innovative technologies that debuted on the competition and made the broadcast more enjoyable. His view was shared by Italian Canoe Federation president Luciano Buonfiglio, who stated that \"for the member countries of the international federation, Szeged has been a very good occasion, in the best way, to showcase our sport on the international stage. Hungarian television production was really fantastic.\"\nExplanation of events.\nCanoe sprint competitions are broken up into Canadian canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.\nParacanoeist race in the traditional kayak (K) discipline and in va'a (V), which is canoe with an outrigger, that helps the canoeist to poise the boat. The contenders are divided into three classes according to the level of their disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can apply force to the footboard to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but they are unable to apply continuous and controlled force to the footboard to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.\nParticipating nations.\n88 countries have entered athletes.\nMedal summary.\nMen's.\n Non-Olympic classes\nWomen's.\n Non-Olympic classes"

This was the second South African tour of the Northern Hemisphere, after the very successful 1906 tour.\nAlthough not managing to win all the matches on the tour, the Springboks won all five test matches against international opposition. Billy Millar was the tour captain even though he was the last person chosen for the tour and was not the selectors' choice of captain, but they were over-ruled by the South African Rugby Board. Millar did have the advantage of being one of the few players to have toured Britain in the previous test, but was seen by the hosts as a fiery character and was not as popular with the players or fans as the 1906's tour captain, Paul Roos. The other two members of the squad to have played in the 1906 tour were vice-captain Fred 'Uncle' Dobbin and Doug Morkel.\nIn the touring party were two sets of brothers; Richard, Freddie and John Luyt and Gerhard and Jack Morkel.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by the \"Springboks\" in Europe:\n Test matches"

The championship was an international series established by the American Motorcyclist Association as a pilot event to help establish motocross in the United States. The series was based on a 500cc engine displacement formula, although the first year of the event featured both 250 and 500cc events. The races run on American tracks to international standards, featuring the top riders from the F.I.M. world championship against the top American riders. In 1970 and 1971, the highest placing American rider at the end of the series was considered the A.M.A. national champion. \nBy 1978, American riders had improved to the point where it became more of a challenge for European riders to secure an easy victory. Since riders were paid based upon their results rather than starting money paid in European races, fewer European riders were motivated to make the costly trans-atlantic voyage. After 1978 the series was renamed the Trans-USA series, but had fewer European riders participating. The Inter-AMA series was a similar year-end championship, but used a 250cc engine displacement formula."

        "title": "Rugby union in Hong Kong",
        "text": "Rugby union in Hong Kong is long established, partly as a result of its being a British colony. Rugby union is one of the most popular sports in Hong Kong. In contrast to the People's Republic of China, it has had a continuous existence dating back over a hundred years, and is most notable for the Hong Kong Sevens tournament, the best known of the rugby sevens tournaments. The top domestic club competition is the HKRFU Premiership.\nGoverning Body.\nThe Hong Kong Rugby Football Union was established in 1952, and joined the IRB in 1988.\nHistory.\nRugby football has been played in Hong Kong for over a hundred and fifty years.\nHong Kong is best known for its development of rugby sevens, an abbreviated code from Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Naturally it became popular amongst other groups in the city, particularly other white ex-patriates. Hong Kong Football Club was established in 1886, and played its first game of rugby against a 'Garrison XV' the same year. Prior to that it is likely that ad hoc games were organised by businessmen, such as HSBC. British forces sides would also have been prominent.\nFormal competition began in 1910-11 with a 'Triangular' tournament between HKFC, the Royal Navy and Army. This was expanded to a 'Quadrangular' in 1940 with the addition of a side from Hong Kong Police. After WWII the competition recommenced in 1947-48, becoming a 'Pentangular' in 1954 when the RAF joined in, and a year later a 'Hexangular' when the Army split their resources 'North and South'.\nNevertheless, the HKRFU decreed in 1957 that however many teams there might be in the top flight competition, it would be known as the 'Pentangular' - and so it remained until 1975 when a 'Division 1' championship was instigated following the founding of two new civilian clubs, Valley in 1975 and Kowloon in 1976 (having previously competed as YMCA from 1974).\nIn the late-1980s, the local Chinese began to participate more fully, with the establishment of a Police team of locals, the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme (DEA) had a team as did a team of Japanese, Gai Wu. With the booming of the HK economy came more and more expatriates, in 1992 a team of expat old boys of King George V School formed Typhoons and Aberdeen RFC was established in 1993. In the same year a team, with many local players Causeway Bay RFC was established.\nWomen began playing full contact rugby in 1991, and a women's league, playing 7s, was set up in 1992. After a few seasons playing 10s, women's league is now full XV-a-side.\nRugby caught on slowly but surely with the local population, thanks to HKRFU's constantly improving development programme, and the fact that many more local Chinese had played whilst in overseas education, and simply because rugby has been widely recognised as an excellent game to play.\nThis fact is clear to see from the explosion of mini rugby in the local population since c.2000. Having previously been established by expat parents in 1979, the game expanded slowly through and the 1980s and became more and more attractive to local families as the 1990s went on. There are now rugby clubs in all parts of Hong Kong, and playing numbers are measure in thousands, if not tens of thousands.\nThe transfer of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China was not the total disaster for rugby there that some predicted. Since the handover, the Hong Kong Sevens continue to flourish, and there is increasing interest in the game within Mainland China as well.\nHong Kong Sevens.\nBecause of the territory's small size, it was argued that rugby sevens would be more useful in promoting the game than 15-a-side.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens have proven a powerful missionary force in Asia, allowing nations with small numbers of players to compete at a high level, and improve the standard of their game. Perhaps because of this high profile, Hong Kong was allowed to compete in the Asian Championship, a predecessor to the Asian Five Nations.\nBill McLaren, in his autobiography \"Talking of Rugby\" writes at length about his Hong Kong Sevens experiences:\nThe Hong Kong Sevens (Chinese: 香港國際七人欖球賽) is considered the premier tournament on the IRB Sevens World Series in rugby union. The tournament was set up in 1976, and attracted clubs from Asia and beyond, from Indonesia, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Japan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Fiji for the first tournament alone. It was held at the Hong Kong Football Club in Happy Valley. After an initial proposal was refused by the Rugby Football Union in England, the HKRFU changed focus and sent out invitations to Asian and Pacific sides.\nThe Rugby World Cup Sevens have been held twice in Hong Kong - see 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens and 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\n2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia.\nThe 2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia started with a match against the Barbarians in Hong Kong.\nNational team.\nHong Kong has two 15-a-side teams - men's and women's\nThe men's team is a third tier rugby playing nation. They first played in 1952, the first local Chinese to be capped was Chan Fuk-ping in 1994. These days, HK players consist of a mixture of both Hong Kong Chinese, and Caucasian players, with some players being mixed race.\nThey have competed in the first Asian Five Nations recently.\nHKRFU Premiership.\nThe 6-team HKRFU Premiership is the top level of competition. The HKRFU Premiership A is the next rung down."

The victory broke a 74 Year drought without a first-grade two-day premiership for the demons. Bayswater-Morley would also be runners-up in the one-day competition losing out to Claremont-Nedlands in the final. In the T20 competition, it was Fremantle who defeated Subiaco-Floreat.\nPerth went back to back in the 2023-24 season, defeating Bayswater-Morley in the one day grand final held at WACA ground, two day semi final and Scarborough in the two day final. The two day final was held at Bayswater-Morley home ground Hillcrest reserve. Andrew Tye took 5 wickets during Perth's batting inning that saw Jacob Snadden make a half century. Ethan Carrington dominated with the ball, taking 7 wickets. Carrington was awarded player of the match and could be heard banging and singing the Perth CC song from all present at Hillcrest Reserve. John Lindsay, President of Perth CC was elated and has since offered to adopt Carrington and include him as a benefactor for the family estate.\nWestern Australian Premier Cricket Clubs.\nWestern Australian Premier Cricket Club Teams (Current).\n+ Last Title/s in 1st Grade\n Bayswater-Morley was known as the Bassendean Cricket Club between 1932–33 and 1947–48, the Bassendean Turf Cricket Club from 1947–48 to 1960–61 and the Bassendean-Bayswater Cricket Club from 1960–61 to 1980–81.&lt;br&gt;\n Claremont-Nedlands was formed in 1989 from a merger of the Claremont-Cottesloe and Nedlands Cricket Clubs.

Bryant finished comfortably ahead in total score and total hits, adding 4 more points to give him 8.2 out of the possible 10 and the gold medal.

        "title": "Boxing in China",
        "text": "Boxing in China began as a street sport in the 1920s, mainly in the port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, where foreign sailors were pitted against local fighters in the ring. The sport grew rapidly and unsupervised by the Chinese government. Chinese boxing style is similar to Western boxing style, with influences from traditional Chinese martial arts.\n1950s.\nIn 1953, at a big competition in the northern city of Tianjin, a boxer died after a bout. Sports authorities were unnerved, and in 1959, as China organized its first National Games, it dropped boxing from the lineup. Mao Zedong was driving the country further into isolation. Fan Hong, a scholar who specializes in China's athletic history, commented, \"People believed that boxing was very brutal, very ruthless, and those were said to be the characteristics of capitalism. So it was banned.\"\n1960s and 1970s.\nWhen the Cultural Revolution occurred in China, in 1966, the Communist Party banned competitive sports. After the Cultural Revolution subsided, in 1969, China used Ping Pong matches to reconnect with the world. It was not until the late 1970s that Deng Xiaoping decided that competition might be as good for athletics as it was for the economy. In December 1979, Deng invited Muhammad Ali to the compound housing China's top leaders. The champion boxer hugged Deng. They sat and talked. Later, the word went out and Deng sent the message out that \"If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals\".\n1980s and 1990s.\nIn the 1980s, began training again, after a fashion. Athletes had no bags or gloves. Sandbags were traditionally used instead. Liu Gang was one of the earliest recruits and is now China's biggest promoter. China first competed in boxing at the 1992 Summer Olympics, in Barcelona, where competitors were delighted to face off against Chinese opponents as China had been weak in that sport. The best that their coaches hoped for was that each fighter might stay on his feet a bit longer than the one before him.\n2000s and 2010s.\nIt was until the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens that Zou Shiming claimed China's first boxing medal. He eventually made it into the semifinals and won a bronze. This achievement was greeted with rapturous applause and Chinese reporters nicknamed him the \"Dark Horse\" at first because of his underdog status. Later, they tried the \"Knight of Lightning\" or the \"Fox\" or, sometimes, the \"Pirate\", all celebrating his knack for snatching points and peeling away from his opponents' reach. That strategy was helping him win international matches. In Athens, Zou made it to the semifinals, eventually winning a bronze, China’s first in boxing. It was another year before Zou won his first gold medal, at the 2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships, held in the western Chinese city of Mianyang. He was the nation's first amateur boxing champion, and China celebrated.\nChina's boxing performance improved dramatically at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Zou Shiming won the gold medal in the Light Flyweight (-48 kg) event, and Zhang Xiaoping won the gold medal in the Light Heavyweight (81 kg) event.\nOn 24 November 2012 Xiong Zhao Zhong became the first male boxer from China to win a major professional world boxing title, the WBC minimumweight title. The fight was well received with many of China's major media organisations hailing the event as a huge success. Due to the overwhelming positive reaction boxing promoters have promised to accelerate the growth of boxing throughout China. Light Flyweight contender Ma Yiming challenged for the WBA light flyweight interim championship in April 2015, losing via a first round technical knockout. Similarly, Ik Yang fought veteran César Cuenca and lost via unanimous decision for the vacant IBF light welterweight title.\nCompatriot Li Wenyang won a minor world title (UBO light welterweight title) in 2011. This was followed by heavyweight Zhang Junlong's win against Jason Gavern which won him a minor title in 2014 (interim WBU heavyweight title). Zou Shiming made history becoming the 2nd Chinese National to win a World Championship title with a unanimous-decision over Prasitsak Phaprom of Thailand, to win the WBO flyweight championship fight at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, US on Nov 5, 2016.\nXu Can becomes China's 3rd World Boxing Champion in his unanimous victory over Jesus Rojas of Puerto Rico for the WBA Featherweight World Title in Houston Texas on January 26, 2019"

There are currently just under six hundred registered players in the country.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Indonesian Rugby Football Union which is a member of World Rugby, and Asian Rugby Football Union.\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into the Dutch East Indies, during the colonial period.\nIn 1983, it was recorded that there were four rugby clubs in the country, namely the International Sports Club (consisting of businessmen) based in Jakarta, another based in Kalimantan (mostly of French origin), another based at Bandung (with a 15 ft rise between the touchlines), and the fourth, bizarrely was based on a US Navy vessel, and its home games were played there. Many of Indonesia's rugby pitches still have unusual distinctions - one is in the heart of the Indonesian jungle, another on a mountain summit, and another in the middle of a tea plantation.\nSupposedly the game died out in 1986, after Indonesia had participated in Hong Kong Sevens. However, with the help of a group of Australian, New Zealand and Welsh expats, along with local Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans, the game was revived in 2004.\nAlthough traditionally seen as the province of Commonwealth expatriates, the game has made strides amongst the native population.\nAs with many other minor rugby nations, the sport is mainly played in and around the capital Jakarta. It is often staged by various multisport clubs. Among the more prominent Jakarta-based clubs are the Jakarta Komodos Rugby Club and the Jakarta Banteng Rugby Club.\nToday there is an Indonesia national rugby union team and a somewhat successful sevens team, and the game is somewhat more developed, but remains minor. There is also an ongoing schools programme."

        "title": "Volkswagen Golf Mk6",
        "text": "The Volkswagen Golf Mk6 (code named \"Typ 5K\") is a compact car and the sixth generation of the Volkswagen Golf. The Volkswagen Golf Mk6 is the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 and It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008 for the 2009 model year. Volkswagen released pictures and information on August 6, 2008, prior to the official unveiling. The vehicle was released to the European market in the winter of 2008. Volkswagen claimed investments were made in production efficiency, with a claimed productivity improvement at launch of nearly 20% in comparison with the previous model, with further gains planned for the first twelve months of production. This model year was also a part of the Dieselgate scandal.\nAlthough billed as the Mk6, the new model was largely based on its predecessor, the Golf Mk5, and was effectively a re-engineered facelift of the previous model. In January 2013, it was superseded by the Volkswagen Golf Mk7, which was built on the newly assembled MQB platform.\nDesign.\nLike its predecessor, the Mk6 Golf is based on the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform. It is effectively a reskin of the Mk5 rather than an all-new design; it was developed with engineering improvements to shorten the previous model's assembly time to save costs. Additionally, it answered criticisms of that model's cheapened interior quality compared to that of the Mk4 and Mk3 Golf.\nSpecifications.\nEquipment.\nImprovements in equipment level on the domestic market Golfs include—for the first time in a Golf—air conditioning as standard.\nAdditionally, dual-zone climate control is included in the Autobahn trim for North America.\nEngines.\nThe company spoke confidently of launching a BlueMotion low emissions Golf in Germany, back in 2009. They've also mentioned utilizing alternative fuels in later products.\nSafety.\nWith safety features such as seven standard airbags (up to nine in Europe, up to eight in the US) and standard Electronic Stability Programme (ESP), the Golf Mk6 has scored 36 out of 37 possible points for occupant protection, giving it a five-star rating by the Euro NCAP crash test agency. It was one of the safest vehicles in its class at the time of its release.\nModels.\nCabriolet.\nThe Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet was presented at the 2011 Geneva International Motor Show. The four-seater has a soft top with an electro-hydraulic drive that opens the Golf's top in 9.5 seconds. The top can also be opened or closed while driving, but only under 30kmh (19mph). This car was the first Cabriolet model under the Golf family since 2002.\nThe VW Golf Cabriolet's styling follows that of its hard-top three-door counterpart, but it differs somewhat with a rear section, lower profile roofline and more swept-back angle of its front windscreen frame. Bi-xenon headlights are an option. Unlike the regular Golf, the Cabriolet has LED rear lights, which are only available for the R and GTI versions of the hardtop. Safety features include the automatically deploying roll-over bar, front airbags, side head/thorax airbags, knee airbag for the driver and ESP.\nThere are six turbocharged direct-injection engines whose power outputs range from to . Four of the petrol engines (TSI) and one diesel (TDI) are available with the DSG dual-clutch gearbox; while three of the engines are available with energy-saving BlueMotion Technology.\nIn February 2012, Volkswagen announced that they would build a Cabriolet version of the GTI, powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.\nAs of October 2016, VW announced that the Golf cabriolet will no longer be sold in the UK due to financial reasons.\nStation wagon.\nA facelifted variant Mk5 Golf Variant model was introduced in 2009 as the Mk6, despite carrying the front fascia, interior styling, and the powertrain from the new Golf, the body shell and underpinnings are based on its fifth-generation predecessor. It is sold in the US as the Jetta SportWagen, in Mexico and Canada as the Golf Wagon and in South America as the Jetta Variant or Vento Variant.\nGolf Plus.\nIn December 2008, a facelifted version of the Golf Plus was revealed at the Bologna Motor Show, featuring a revised front end, similar to the Golf Mk6, but still largely retaining the design of the rear end and the interior of the Mk5 based vehicle. In 2014, the Golf Plus was replaced by the MQB-based Golf Sportsvan, which was originally shown as the Sportsvan concept.\nTwin Drive.\nVolkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn announced Golf Twin Drive plug-in hybrid concept based on Mk5 Golf, which uses 2.0 L I4 turbodiesel and electric motor with lithium-ion batteries. The car can run about 50 kilometres on battery power. The combined power is .\nVolkswagen developed the Twin Drive system with eight German partners, and is planning a trial fleet of 20 Golfs outfitted with the system in 2010.\nThe production version was expected to be based on new Mk6 Golf, featuring a 1.5 L turbodiesel engine and electric motor, with estimated arrival date of 2015.\nGolf GTI \"Wörthersee 09\" (2009).\nThe Golf GTI \"Wörthersee 09\" is a concept car based on the Golf GTI. 2.0-liter TSI. Its engine is rated at , with a 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration time of 6.9 seconds and a top speed of . It features a Firespark Metallic red body color with GTI stripes, high-gloss black 19-inch alloy spoke wheels, smoked LED taillights, a lowered chassis and a new sport exhaust. Changes to the interior include aluminum tread plates, brushed aluminum trim and glossy black painted frames around the air vents, red bordered floor mats and black Nappa leather sport seats with red accents and \"Berry White\" leather piping.\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the \"Wörthersee GTi-Treffen\" meet in Wörthersee, Austria.\nGolf R.\nThere was much speculation about this vehicle, with uncertainty surrounding its name. Golf R20 was the most common name used prior to the Frankfurt Motor Show. Once finally unveiled by Volkswagen at the Frankfurt IAA on 15 September 2009, it was confirmed the R32 replacement would simply be called the Golf R.\nThe Golf R is powered by a FSI turbocharged Inline-four engine that produces at 6000 rpm and at 2500-5000 rpm of torque. VW claims the car can get from 0– in 5.5 seconds for DSG equipped models, or 5.7 seconds for cars fitted with a manual transmission. It employs a revised (5th-generation) Haldex 4motion all-wheel drive system.\nIn Australia, Japan, China, America and South Africa the Golf R engine is detuned to suit hotter climate conditions, from to and from to .\nOn 9 December 2010 Volkswagen announced that the Golf R will be available in the United States beginning in 2012, in both two- and four-door versions were offered, but without the DSG transmission, and with a slightly detuned engine producing and . A Canadian version was announced for early 2012, but only as a four-door version with six-speed manual transmission.\nSpecial editions.\nGTI Edition 35.\nFollowing Volkswagen's 30th anniversary edition GTI, the 35th anniversary was celebrated with the GTI Edition 35. Its engine was an updated version of the Mk5 GTI engine (also used in the Mk6 Golf R), with 232 bhp (compared to 266 for the R). Acceleration from 0-62 mph is in 6.6 seconds.\nInternational markets.\nIn the United States and Canada, the car was sold as the Volkswagen Golf when it arrived in showrooms in October 2009, dropping the \"Rabbit\" badge that was used for the Golf Mk5. The wagon, a restyled version of the Mk5 and the only Golf model made in Mexico, is sold in Canada as \"Golf Wagon\", but in the United States retains the \"Jetta SportWagen\" designation (while wearing Golf front sheetmetal). North American Golfs will carry over the same engines as the Mk5 (the same 2.5L five-cylinder from the Mk5, the 2.0TDI and the 2.0T) and, while the GTI and TDI continue to offer the six-speed manual transmission, the 2.5 L will re-use the five-speed manual (automatic will be a six-speed tiptronic). The new Golf is also available in Mexico but for the time being only in the wagon configuration that is marketed as Golf SportWagen that became available in early October replacing the Bora Sportwagen with the new Golf's front end.\nThe Australian public got their first taste of the new Mk6 at the Melbourne International Motor Show, which began on 27 February 2009. The new Golf was launched around the country at the same time. The Mk6 GTI went on sale from 30 October 2009. On 19 January 2010 the Golf was awarded the 2009 Wheels Car of the Year title, which is acknowledged as the country's most prestigious car award. It was the first time the Golf had been awarded the title since 1976. VW Australia launched the new base model golf with 1.2-litre engine same as the new Polo in September 2010 and went on sale in 2011.\nIn South Africa the new Mk6 Golf went on sale in April 2009. The South African version of the GTI went on sale in July 2009.\nIn Japan the new Mk6 Golf went on sale in April 2009. The Japanese version of the GTI went on sale in August 2009.\nIn China, the Golf Mk6 was made by FAW-VW commencing production for the 2009 model year, succeeding the Mk4 Golf and China-exclusive Bora HS as the Mk5 variant was not produced in China. The sixth generation GTI began to be built locally for first time in March 2010 and used a different engine compared to Golf GTI model sold internationally, where a 2-litre TSI unit producing was available as standard, less than the original one. This engine is also used by the VW Magotan. Other engines include a 1.4 TSI and a 1.6 naturally aspirated engine producing and , respectively. The 5 speed manual and 7 speed dual clutch gearbox was standard on TSI models while the 1.6 litre units were paired to a 5 speed manual and 6 speed automatic gearbox. Pricing for the 1.4 TSI ranged between 135,800 and 166,800 yuan with three trims ($20,820 to $25,575 US - April 2021 exchange rate), 118,800 yuan to 156,800 yuan with five trims for the 1.6 ($18,215 to $24,040 US - April 2021 exchange rate) and 235,800 yuan ($36,154 US - April 2021 exchange rate) for the Golf GTI model. Production for this generation ended in 2013, where it was replaced the Golf Mk7.\nIn Mexico, the only two versions available until August 2011 were the German-imported 3-door GTI in both 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG transmissions, and the Mexican-produced Golf SportWagen with a 170 bhp 2.5 L inline 5-cylinder with a 6-speed Tiptronic transmission. In September 2012, a 5-door version in Comfortline trim, with 1.4 L TSI engine with 177 hp and 6-speed manual gearbox imported from Germany was added. Since the end of production is imminent, it will be limited to 4,000 units.\nIn Chile, the Golf Mk6 was presented in October 2010 at the XI Salón del Automóvil de Santiago, starting sales immediately. Chile is the first country in South America to sell the Mk6, as a restyled version of the Mk4 is still in production in Brazil for Latin America. The Mk6 is available in Chile with the 1.6 L Petrol engine (101 hp) both in five-speed manual and seven-speed DSG transmissions.\nIn India, the Golf Mk6 was rumored to be introduced in 2011 but in a recent interview, Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer said that the plans for introducing a Golf have been suspended, to preserve the success of VW Vento in the Indian market. The Golf, if released, would be similarly priced as the Vento and VW does not want Vento sales to slip. He also stated they may bring in a more localized Golf with the same engine choices as the Vento when numbers stabilize in the near future.\nMotorsport.\nIn auto racing, APR Motorsport has led two MKVI VW GTIs to victory in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge Street Tuner (ST) class.\nTo commemorate the 35th Anniversary of the Golf GTI, Volkswagen Motorsport entered the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring with the \"Golf24\". This Golf was equipped with a\n2,500 cc five-cylinder turbo engine with and , permanent 4WD and a sequential six-speed gearbox. In the third VLN race of 2011, the Golf24 finished sixth overall, with its best lap only nine seconds slower than the fastest race lap, which was clocked by a Ferrari 458. For the 24 Hours, the team hoped for rain, and jokingly considered wetting the track by aerial firefighting. Eventually, though, neither of the three Golf24s finished the race, with one of them suffering a pit-entry accident and another blowing a gearbox. When the gearbox of the remaining Golf24 started overheating, VW decided to retire it to find out the cause of the gearbox trouble."

        "text": "Steve Morris (1 September 1896 – 29 May 1965) was a Welsh international rugby union flanker who played club rugby for Cross Keys. A hard man, Morris was extremely physical in the way he played the game, sometimes over physical and he was unafraid to turn to violence if it was warranted. It is reported that he once knocked out a Welsh heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring session. At 6 foot and over 14 stone in weight, Morris was a hulking player, but he was still recognised as a cheerful and genial person.\nA coal miner by profession, Morris would work down the pit at Risca Colliery on a Saturday morning and then turn out to play for Cross Keys in the afternoon. Morris spent his entire playing career at Cross Keys and later became the club's chairman. On his death his ashes were scattered at Pandy Park, the team's home ground.\nClub career.\nMorris began playing rugby before the outbreak of World War I and continued playing when he could as a recruit in the British Army. After returning to Wales he turned out for Cross Keys in April 1919 against the touring New Zealand Army XV. Twelve years later, Morris was still turning out for his club and in 1931 he was part of the joint Abertillery / Cross Keys team that faced the touring South African team. Morris was extremely loyal to Cross Keys, never the most fashionable of rugby clubs, and on one occasion it is said he turned down a £1,000 contract to turn to rugby league.\nInternational career.\nMorris made his international debut against England in 1920, the first Cross Keys player to represent his country. In the game against France in 1920, Morris played alongside his Cross Keys team mate, Fred Reeves, made all the more special as the two of them were also co-workers at the Risca Colliery. Morris gained 19 caps in total and should have gained more but missed the Ireland match after being sent off in a club game. Morris's aggression was used to good effect in other games; when in 1923 against an overly violent French team he and Swansea's Tom Parker were called upon to fight back to subdue their opponents. In his penultimate game against France at St. Helens in Swansea, Morris was given the captaincy of Wales, but the team suffered a fairly heavy defeat even after a late Welsh surge masterminded by their new captain.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Parker made his debut for Swansea in 1913 and captained his club in the 1920/21 season Parker would play 15 times for Wales, seven of them as captain. He was surprisingly one of the most successful captains in the history of Welsh rugby with 6 wins and 1 draw, all played during the 1920s, a decade that is seen as the worst period in Welsh rugby.\nInternational rugby career.\nUnusual for a new international, Parker gained his first cap against a touring side. In 1919 Parker was chosen to play against the New Zealand Army XV, and the next season would face all the home nations. His first game against England saw a Welsh team filled with new caps, so it was an impressive win when Wales beat their rivals 19–5, with Jerry Shea scoring 16 of the points. Parker's first international try came in 1920 in a match against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park. One of Parker's more memorable matches came in 1923 against France when, along with Steve Morris of Cross Keys, he spent large parts of the game fighting against an overly violent French squad.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program of Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. The team competes in the Big East Conference and plays their home games in the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The Pirates are currently coached by Shaheen Holloway. Seton Hall has appeared 14 times in the NCAA tournament and were national runners-up in 1989.\nHistory.\nSeton Hall's first season of basketball occurred in 1903–04, but the school did not field a team again until 1908–09, the year in which the university achieved its first winning season. The school adopted the Pirate mascot in 1931, and the teams soon gained national prominence with the arrival of John \"Honey\" Russell in 1936. During an 18-year span, the Pirates racked up a 295–129 record that included an undefeated 19–0 record in 1939–40 as part of a 41-game unbeaten streak. Walsh Gymnasium was opened in 1941 to house the basketball team permanently and featured one of the best Seton Hall teams of all time, termed the \"Wonder Five\", which led by All-American Bob Davies, earned the school's first NIT bid in 1941. Following World War II, the Pirates were led by stars Frank Saul and Bobby Wanzer and regularly played games at Madison Square Garden. The peak of this era occurred in 1953 when Richie Regan and Walter Dukes defeated rival St. John's University for the NIT title. Perhaps the low point for the team occurred in 1961 when a point shaving scandal sullied the program, but the Pirates rebounded to return to the NIT in 1974 under coach Bill Raftery. Seton Hall became a charter member of the Big East Conference in 1979, where they are still a member to this day.\nAlthough Seton Hall did have a lengthly American Football Team, The high point of the Big East era for Seton Hall came when P. J. Carlesimo was hired in 1982 and the team began playing in the Meadowlands Arena. By 1988, Carlesimo led the Pirates to the school's first NCAA tournament appearance, and in 1989, he led the Hall to an unexpected tournament run to the NCAA Championship game, where they were defeated by Michigan in overtime. Success under Carlesimo continued with a Big East tournament championship and an Elite Eight appearance in 1991, a regular season Big East Championship and Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1992, and Big East Regular Season and Big East tournament Championships in 1993. Carlesimo left to coach in the NBA following the 1993–94 season, but Seton Hall returned to the Sweet Sixteen in 2000 guided by coach Tommy Amaker, and appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2004 and 2006 coached by Louis Orr. In 2006–07, Bobby Gonzalez was hired to lead the Pirates, which moved its home games into the Prudential Center in 2007. Gonzalez amassed a 66–59 record at Seton Hall but was fired at the conclusion of the 2009–10 after a first-round NIT loss to Texas Tech. Concerns were raised in-house about the direction Gonzalez was taking the program, punctuated by several incidents, some involving Gonzalez and others involving student athletes. Shortly after his dismissal Gonzalez was arrested for shoplifting. Seton Hall then hired Kevin Willard for the 2010–11 season.\nAfter struggling to maintain a .500 record through his first five seasons with the program, Willard's Pirates finally broke through in the 2015–16 season, as they won the Big East tournament Championship over the eventual national champion Villanova Wildcats. With the win, Seton Hall secured the school's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2006 and the first Big East tournament Championship since 1993. However, the magic could not continue in the NCAA tournament, as the team was defeated by the 11th-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs in the First Round. In 2017, the Pirates were again eliminated in the First Round of the NCAA tournament by the Arkansas Razorbacks, but the Pirates would win their first tournament game in fourteen years upon defeating the NC State Wolfpack in 2018's first round before being defeated by the Kansas Jayhawks in the Second Round. Following the graduation of starting seniors Khadeen Carrington, Ángel Delgado, Desi Rodriguez, and Ismael Sanogo, the Pirates would appear in their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament for the second time in program history in 2019. Led by the play of standout junior guard Myles Powell, the Pirates, at risk of missing the tournament sitting on a 16–12 overall and 7–9 Big East record, won their final two regular season games at home against 16th-ranked Marquette and 23rd-ranked Villanova and advanced to the Big East Final where they lost a rematch to Villanova by two points. Ultimately, they secured a #10 seed in the tournament following their performance down the stretch, and fell to the Wofford Terriers in a first round game in which Fletcher Magee would break Division I's all-time three-point scoring record. In November 2021, Seton Hall traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan to play the then #4 ranked Michigan Wolverines as part of the Big East-Big10 Gavitt Games. Of note was that the game was the first time the two programs had met since the 1989 NCAA National Championship Game when Michigan beat Seton Hall by one on a controversial foul call. In the 2021 version, Seton Hall upset Michigan, making it the first time Seton Hall had won a road game against a non-conference AP top-five team in university history. They were 0-5 prior.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Pirates have appeared in the NCAA tournament 14 times. \nTheir combined record is 16–14.\nNIT results.\nThe Pirates have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 19 times.

Rutgers made the NCAA Final Four in 1976. Rutgers has appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times, most recently appearing in 2022. Rutgers has produced many NBA players, most notably Roy Hinson, John Battle, and James Bailey.\nHistory.\nThe Rutgers men's basketball team played in the Final Four in the 1976 NCAA tournament and ended the 1976 season ranked fourth in the nation, after a 70–86 loss against the Michigan Wolverines in the semifinal round and a 92–106 loss to the UCLA Bruins in the tournament's third-place consolation game. This was the last men's Division I tournament to date to feature two unbeaten teams, as both Indiana, who won that year's title, and Rutgers entered the tournament unbeaten. Rutgers went 31–0 during the regular season.\nThe Scarlet Knights also played in the championship game of the 2004 NIT Final, losing to the Michigan Wolverines 55–62.\nThe Scarlet Knights had a prolonged down period through the following decade, cycling through a number of coaches and routinely finishing at the bottom of the Big East standings. This period included a scandal in 2013 with then head coach Mike Rice Jr. being shown on video verbally and physically abusing players. The scandal resulted in the firing of Coach Rice as well as the resignation of then Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti.\nRutgers basketball played their first season in the Big Ten conference in 2014–2015. After the hiring of Head Coach Steve Pikiell in 2016, the program began to see renewed success. In the 2019-20 season, led by guards Geo Baker and Ron Harper Jr., the Scarlet Knights reached the 20-win mark for the first time since the 2003-04 season, including an 18-1 home record and four wins against ranked opponents. That year, they ranked in the top 25 of the AP men's college basketball poll for the first time since 1979. Experts widely predicted Rutgers' inclusion in the 2020 NCAA tournament, but the event was cancelled before the field was announced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following season, the team would officially break its 30-year tournament drought when it earned a 10-seed in the 2021 NCAA tournament, where it would also achieve its first tournament win since 1983 in a first round win over Clemson. The Scarlet Knights returned to the tournament again the next season, becoming the team with the lowest NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool) ranking at 77th overall to receive an at-large bid since the NCAA has utilized the NET to inform tournament selection choices.\nAfter disappointing back-to-back seasons of missed tournaments, the Scarlet Knights now anticipate the arrival of their 2024 recruiting class, which ranks among the best of all collegiate basketball programs for the year, headlined by two McDonald's All-American players: forward Airious \"Ace\" Bailey and guard Dylan Harper. \nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Scarlet Knights have appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times. Their combined record is 6–9.\nNIT results.\nThe Scarlet Knights have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 15 times.

The last time cricket featured in a major multi-sport event was at the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The gold medal was won on that occasion by South Africa, who defeated Australia by 4 wickets in the final with New Zealand winning the bronze medal. At a general meeting of the Olympic Council of Asia, held in Kuwait on 17 April 2007, it was announced that cricket would be included as a medal sport in the 2010 Asian Games to be held in Guangzhou. Matches would be played on a Twenty20, 20-overs per side format.\nFollowing the announcement, Asian Cricket Council Chief Executive Syed Ashraful Huq said \"Cricket will receive a major boost across Asia and in particular China, as a result of this enlightened decision. The Asian Cricket Council pledges its support to the Guangzhou games organizers in order to make the event a success.\"\nAsian cricketing powerhouses India and Pakistan have been the drivers behind the inclusion of cricket in the Asian Games. The Test status nations in the Asian Cricket Council, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka would compete with the initial plan that the Associate teams such as Nepal would also be invited to play in the inaugural competition. China will compete as the host nation which serves as a boost for the Chinese Cricket Association which has boldly stated its ambition of China becoming a force in one-day cricket by the 2019 World Cup.\nThe plans for including Associate/Affiliate nations in the Asian Games was later changed, along with the format that the competition would take place in, changing from 50 over matches to Twenty20 matches. It was decided that the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup would serve as the pre-tournament qualifying competition. Afghanistan qualified as winners of the tournament along with the national teams of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\nCricket was not held in 2018 Asian Games but in 2019, during Olympic Council of Asia's General Assembly it was decided the return of the sport in the 2022 Asian Games, which will be held in Hangzhou, China."

Teams marked in \"green\" qualified to the knockout stage, while the remaining teams were eliminated.\nTies were broken based on records in head-to-head competition among tied teams. In the event of a three-way tie for first place, the tie was broken by calculating the ratio of runs allowed to defensive innings played for all teams involved in the tie. The team with the lowest runs-per-defensive-inning ratio was ranked first and advanced. Second place was determined by the head-to-head result of the other two teams. If the three-way tie was for second place, the runs-per-defensive-inning ratio rule was used. The team with the lowest run ratio advanced; the other two teams were eliminated.\nUnited States.\nAll times US EDT.\nInternational.\nAll times US EDT.\nElimination round.\n\"The United States championship game on August 29 was originally scheduled for 3:00 pm US EDT. After a pair of lengthy rain delays in the international championship game, maintenance required to repair the field for the next game, and to make sure the field was dry enough to play on, it was rescheduled for later that night.\"\nChampions path.\nThe Park View Little League won 18 games and lost 2 games to reach the Little League World Series. Overall, their record was 23–3. Their three losses came against Sweetwater Valley LL, Torrance LL (both from California), and McAllister Park American LL (from Texas). Park View became the ninth team and most recent from San Diego County to qualify for the Little League World Series as the last one was Vista, California in 2005. They also were the third team from San Diego County in the past nine years to qualify for the Little League World Series. During the West Regional the team hit 34 home runs in total and was accused of cheating. A Little League Official looked into the allegations but found no evidence to back them up.\nLegacy.\nThe City of Chula Vista organized a celebration parade for the team with the team riding on a fire engine which led them to a rally at Southwestern College. They received a congratulations from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The team also met President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C., and gave him a team jersey, team plaque and the key to the City of Chula Vista. A book was written about the Chula Vista team called \"The Blue Bombers: The True Story of the 2009 Little League World Champions\", written by San Diego County Residents. A memorial wall was proposed to commemorate the team in Chula Vista. The team also appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" hosted by Conan O'Brien. The team was honored at San Diego Padres and Chargers games."

The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied ballet for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast Ágnes Keleti won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. Larisa Latynina, the first great Soviet gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 World Champion while pregnant with her daughter. Czech gymnast Věra Čáslavská, who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.\nIn the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — Ludmilla Tourischeva was sixteen at her first Olympics in 1968 — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.\nList of Olympic all-around champions.\nNB: \"The \"age at Olympics\" is calculated from the first day of Olympics gymnastics competition, if available; or the date of the Olympics opening ceremonies.\""

He stayed with the club until 2007 before joining Greek side NO Patras in 2008 and stayed until 2009.\n2010 saw Alexander move to Australian National Water Polo League club Victorian Tigers and was named to the 2010 All Star team en route to winning the 2010 NWPL Championship. He remained with the club through the 2011 season.\nWhile competing overseas, Alexander has been with San Francisco, California-based Olympic Club as early as 2009.\nInternational.\nJunior teams.\nAlexander represented the United States on the Junior National Team from 2002 to 2003.

He played in the back row as a flanker for Edinburgh Rugby.\nClub career.\nCross was educated at Sedbergh School. He joined Edinburgh Rugby in 2003 after starting his professional career with London Wasps. He captained the Wasps under-21 side for three years, the culmination of which was beating Bristol in the U21 Final at Twickenham in 2003.\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Cross was loaned by Edinburgh to English National Division One club Waterloo for one month.\nCross was appointed club captain at the start of the 2007–08 season alongside Ally Hogg as first-team captain. Cross retained the club captaincy for the 2008–09 season, with Mike Blair as first team captain.\nIn April 2008, Cross signed a new two-year contract with Edinburgh.\nAs part of the draft of all players from the Scottish professional teams (Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors) to the Scottish Premier One rugby clubs, Cross was selected by Selkirk and was available to play for them during the 2008–09 season when not required by Edinburgh or any of the national teams.\nCross retired from professional rugby at the end of the 2009/2010 season due to persistent knee problems.\nInternational career.\nCross represented Scotland Under-19 in the 2000 IRB/FIRA Junior World Cup.\nIn 2002, Cross turned down the opportunity to play with the England Under-21 team and in 2003 joined the Scottish national training squad pending a ruling from the IRB on his qualification to play for Scotland.\nCross, who has always considered himself to be Scottish, was born in Mauritius whilst his father served there in the British Army. His mother, Fiona, was born in Germany while her father also served in the British Army. His father, Peter, is English. Cross's maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were born in military hospitals, both in India. His great-great-grandfather was born in Scotland.\nOn 21 January 2004, the IRB Regulations Committee ruled that he was free to play for Scotland having demonstrated a \"close, credible and established national link with the country\" and accepted that \"certain rights flow from birth in a British military hospital\". The Committee's statement went on to say that \"if the player, his mother and/or grandfather had not been on military service and therefore born in British military hospitals, the strong likelihood is that given the historical circumstances and family lineage at least one of them would have been born in Scotland. The committee also took the view that close links to Scotland were further demonstrated by the fact that the player, who was eligible to play for other unions, refrained from representing such other unions. In particular he turned down opportunities to play with the England national representative under 21s team in 2002.\"\nDespite having been selected for national training squads by both the current Scotland coach, Frank Hadden, and his predecessor, Matt Williams, and even being named among the replacements, Cross never received a full international cap.\nIn 2007, Cross represented Scotland during the final four rounds of the 2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series in Hong Kong, Adelaide, London and the inaugural Edinburgh Sevens at Murrayfield.\nCoaching.\nIn addition to his playing duties for Edinburgh, Cross was the first team coach for Murrayfield Wanderers for the 2008–09 season. He was then appointed first team coach of Edinburgh Accies for 3 seasons, 2010-2012, where he appointed his Edinburgh team-mate, Andrew Easson as backs coach.\nCross previously coached Penicuik for five years.\nCross worked as Worcester Warriors as defence coach from 2013\nIn May 2017 Cross was appointed head coach at Birmingham Moseley whilst maintaining a role as specialist break-down coach at Worcester\nOn July 7, 2023, Cross was announced as the head coach at Old Glory DC in the USA Major League Rugby"

Murray had planned to travel to Sydney, to join the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League team's tour of New Zealand when he was detained.\nPolice claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane (née Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody.\nMurray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street Offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988.\nIn 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry."

        "title": "The World Tossed at Tennis",
        "text": "The World Tossed at Tennis is a Jacobean era masque composed by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, first published in 1620. It was likely acted on 4 March 1620 (new style) at Denmark House.\nMiddleton and Rowley conducted one of the most interesting collaborative efforts in English Renaissance drama; together they produced significant works, \"The Changeling\" and \"A Fair Quarrel\". Their only masque is one of the stranger and more original literary products of their generation.\nPublication.\n\"A Courtly Masque; the Device called, the World tost at Tennis\" was entered into the Stationers' Register on 4 July 1620, and published later that year in a quarto printed by George Purslowe for the stationer Edward Wright. The title page assigns authorship to Middleton and Rowley; it states that the work was performed \"diverse times\" by Rowley's acting company, Prince Charles's Men.\nThe first edition bears Middleton's dedication to Charles Howard, Baron of Effingham and his wife Mary Lady Effingham, the daughter of Sir William Cockayne, a Lord Mayor of London. It also includes an address to the reader signed by \"Simplicity,\" a Prologue, and a list of \"The Figures and Persons\" in the masque.\nAuthorship.\nIn their other collaborations, Middleton takes primary responsibility for the main plot, and Rowley handles subplot materials – usually comic, but also serious, as in \"A Fair Quarrel\". The standard dichotomy of main plot and subplot does not apply to their masque; in this work, Rowley was mainly responsible for the first half of the work, the first 471 lines, and Middleton the second half, 515 lines. The break between the two writers' shares comes just after the masque's oddest and most original feature, the introduction of the personifications of five coloured starches.\nThe message.\nThe masque was commissioned by Prince Charles. The intent of the masque was to influence his father, King James I, to move away from his pacifistic foreign policy. In 1620, the Thirty Years' War was in its first phase; James daughter and Charles's sister Princess Elizabeth and her husband Frederick V, Elector Palatine had inadvertently started the war when they had accepted the crown of Bohemia in 1618.\nDespite his strong familial connection, James was unwilling to take an active part in the Protestant cause, much to the distress of many of his subjects. The masque had no discernible success in swaying James's position.\nThe masque.\nThe masque features the mythological divinities and personifications that are standard in the masque genre: Jupiter and Pallas Athena are present, as are Time and Deceit, the nine Muses and the Nine Worthies. There is a King and a Lawyer, a \"Land-Captain\" and a \"Sea-Captain,\" and the Devil as well. The second half of the work, Middleton's portion, is dominated by the adventures of Deceit as he interacts with the other characters. Eventually Deceit is defeated by the Lawyer, and the Devil is defeated by the Church.\nThe masque also contains unusual characters; the Induction is a conversation among three personified English royal palaces, St. James's, Richmond, and Denmark House. And the first of the masque's three dances is performed by, of all things, five different-coloured Starches. To appropriate music – \"a light fantastic air\" and \"a ridiculous strain\" – five figures representing coloured starches, white, blue, yellow, green and red, \"come dancing in.\" After their dance, they quarrel; White demands precedence over the others, but they resist. As Yellow puts it, \"I am as stiff i' my opinion / As any Starch amongst you.\"\nThe Starches are examples of what Jupiter calls the \"Deceit and Pride\" of the age, characterised by \"The frenzy of apparel,\" \"masculine painting,\" and \"Vain-glory, fashion, humour, and such toys.\"\nWhy five starches?\nIn the second decade of the seventeenth century, Mistress Anne Turner started a new fashion. It had long been standard in Elizabethan and Jacobean clothing to wear starched white ruffs and cuffs, commonly called \"bands.\" The famous and often-reproduced portrait of actor Edward Alleyn (seen here) provides a good view of the prevailing style. Mrs. Turner was the first person in England to dye these white bands yellow. The fashion became famous and notorious when Turner, an associate of Simon Forman and a denizen of the Jacobean demimonde, was executed on 15 November 1615 for her role in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.\nWhen Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke (in traditional white bands here) sentenced Turner to death, he specifically instructed that she should die in yellow bands: \"as she was the person who had brought yellow starched ruffs into vogue, she should be hanged in that dress, that the same might end in shame and detestation.\" According to at least one report, the hangman also wore yellow bands as he put Turner to death.\nReferences to yellow bands and yellow starch recur in plays of the 1615–18 era, by Middleton and others – \"A Fair Quarrel\", \"The Widow\", \"More Dissemblers Besides Women\", \"Albumazar\", \"The Queen of Corinth\", \"The Devil is an Ass\", and \"Christmas, His Masque\". (Robert Davenport's plays of uncertain date, \"The City Nightcap\" and \"A New Trick to Cheat the Devil\", also contain such references.) \"The World Tossed at Tennis\" is unique in that it refers not only to white and yellow starch but to red, green, and blue starch too. Were these other colours worn in ruffs and cuffs in the years around 1620? The text of the masque suggests this was so, though supporting evidence is thin.\nThe fashion for yellow bands lasted in Court circles until the mid-1620s."

It stars Jessie Matthews, Michael Redgrave, Noel Madison, Margaret Vyner and Alistair Sim, and was first released in the U.K. in November 1938.\nPlot.\nNicky Brooke (Michael Redgrave) a wealthy young man who despite his engagement to the aristocratic (and broke) Lady Constance Westaker (Margaret Vyner) falls for hard-up model Diana Castles (Jessie Matthews) after nearly running her over with his car. In an effort to distance himself from 'tabloid' created tales of his playboy lifestyle, he changes his name and attempts to woo Diana by pretending to be poor.\nProduction.\n\"Climbing High\" was filmed at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire by Gaumont British Picture Corporation.\nReception.\nWriting for Allmovie, Bruce Eder considered \"Climbing High\" to be one of Jessie Matthews' best vehicles which he noted was \"a surprising result considering it is devoid of the musical numbers that one would have expected from one of England's top dancing and singing talents of the period. What it has is a brilliantly piercing witty script ... superbly engaging acting performances by all concerned and superb pacing.\" Eder further noted that \"Carol Reed was only 3 years into his career ... and was already one of the top comedy directors in England.\" He concluded that \"Climbing High\" was \"one of the most entertaining British comedies of the period with some piercing topical humour (especially about the advertising business and political activism) that still holds today.\""

The government itself never supported, but also never opposed fist fighting.\nRussian boyars used the sport as mass entertainment, and acquired the best fighters for competitions.\nThe fights most often took place in holiday times and in crowded places. In winter it took place on ice. First the young children fought, then every pair was more grown up than the previous, ending with the last and most notable fist fighters.\nIn two orders released in 1684 and 1686 fist fighting was forbidden, but the sport continued to live.\nAll regions had their heroes at the sport, but the region with the most famous ones historically is Tula.\nThere are documents saying Peter the Great liked to organize fist fights \"in order to show the ability of the Russian people\".\nIn 1751, a mass fist fight took place on a street in Saint Petersburg, which came to the attention of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After that the Empress forbade the organization of fist fights on the territory of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\nDuring the reign of Catherine the Great, the popularity of fist fighting was growing again, and it is said that Count Orlov was a good fist fighter himself and even invited notable fist fighters to compare powers.\nIn 1832, Nicholas I of Russia completely forbade fist fights as \"harmful fun\".\nLegacy.\nK.V. Gradopolov, then the most important Soviet specialist in Boxing, authored a 1941 work about using proper technique when fist-fighting. In that book, he offered a new exercise, called \"group boxing\", and he mentioned it was an ancient Russian sport (what he was talking about, was the \"Stenka na Stenku\" version).\nRules and types.\nEvery region in Russia incorporated different rules unlike the sport of boxing. In some places they fought with bare arms, while in other they stretched the sleeves over the fists. There were cases where participants would cheat by putting iron under their sleeves.\nThere are three types of Russian fist fighting: the first is the singles type, a one-on-one fight; the second type is a team fight also known as \"wall on wall\". The third one, \"catch drop\", was the least practiced. There were several versions of the singles fight. One version was like modern boxing, where one fighter hits the other wherever he wants or can. The other version is when the fighters take turns hitting each other. Escaping from a punch, answering it not on turn, and moving aside were not allowed; all that could be done was to use the hands to try to protect one's own body. Victory could come in few cases: when one of the fighters falls, till first blood, or till one of the fighters gives up.\nThe \"wall-on-wall\" fight (with anywhere from dozen to several hundreds participants) was performed strictly by rules and could go on for hours. Both \"walls\" had a chief fighter, who served as a tactician and a commanding officer. \"Walls\" themselves were tight straight formations 3-4 ranks deep. Repeated attacks were performed, aiming to push the opposing \"wall\" out of the game area. Basic tactics were used, such as breaching using heavy fighters (who were usually held in reserve), encircling, false retreat and others; but as a rule, tight wall formation never broke. Tactics also included battle planning. The \"wall-on-wall\" fights, while performed for entertainment, were in fact close to military training. For example, notable ethnographer V. Gilyarovsky recalled that during his voluntary service in an infantry regiment soldiers often staged wall-on-wall fistfights with factory workers.\nA famous phrase in Russian, \"Do not hit a man when he's down\", has roots in that sport.\nFist fighting in Russian popular culture.\nAs for centuries fist fighting was so popular and was such a part of Russian folk life, it occurred frequently in Russian literature and art.\nThe most famous portrayal of a Russian fistfight is in Mikhail Lermontov's poem, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov. There, the fistfight tales place as a form of honor duel between an oprichnik (government police agent) and a merchant. It is notable that, according to Lermontov, both characters use combat gloves ('rukavitsy' — reinforced mittens). Though it may be an example of poetic license, the poem states that the first connected blow by Kalashnikov bent a large bronze cross hanging from his opponent's neck, and the second fractured the opponent's temple, killing him. The fight also features in the opera \"The Merchant Kalashnikov\" by Anton Rubinstein (1880).\nIn the 19th century Sergei Aksakov watched famous fist fights in the Kaban frozen lake in Kazan, and later wrote about them in his \"Story about student life\". Some decades later, at the same lake, the young future opera-singer Feodor Chaliapin took part in a similar fight: \"From one side came we, the Russians of Kazan, from the other side the Tatars. We fought hard without feeling sorry for ourselves, but never broke the historic rules of not to hit one that is already down, not to kick, and not to keep iron up one's sleeves\". Later the young Chaliapin was attacked in a fight over a girl, but thanks to his proficiency in fist fighting, he won. He wrote: \"He jumped to beat me, and even though I was afraid of the police, learning fist fighting at the frozen lakes of Kazan helped me, and he humiliatingly lost\".\nThe Russian poet Sergei Yesenin in his autobiography notes \"About myself\" told that his grandfather taught him fist fighting.\nOne of the heroes in the book \"Thief\" by the Soviet novelist Leonid Leonov said: \"In childhood, it happened, only in fist fights I found real friends... And was never wrong! Because only in a fight the whole human nature comes out\".\nClaims have been made that the Russian nobility favoured fistfights over duels, but on the other hand it has been suggested that the nobility actually were against fistfights and preferred weapons."

        "text": "The Boston College Eagles are a NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represents Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. The team has competed in Hockey East since 1984, having previously played in the ECAC. The Eagles have won five national championships, the most recent coming in 2012. Home games have been played at Kelley Rink at Conte Forum, named in honor of long-time BC hockey coach John \"Snooks\" Kelley, since 1986, having previously played at McHugh Forum. The Eagles are coached by former Eagles and NHL defenseman Greg Brown, who recently took over the reins after the retirement of Jerry York.\nBoston College hockey history.\nBoston College is among the top and oldest college hockey programs in the country. The Eagles first fielded a team from 1917 to 1929. School officials briefly dropped hockey as a cost-cutting measure in the wake of the Great Depression.\nThe modern era of hockey on the Heights began when former player John \"Snooks\" Kelley agreed to coach a small team of BC students who formed a team midway through the 1932–33 season. Apart from a short break during World War II, Kelley would lead the Eagles until 1972. He led the Eagles to their first national championship in 1949, along the way establishing Boston College as a perennial powerhouse in both regular season and post-season play.\nFrom 1933–2022, BC hockey only had three other full-time coaches, Len Ceglarski, Steve Cedorchuk, and Jerry York, all Boston College alumni. They all continued to build upon the success began by Kelley. Ceglarski achieved over 400 career wins with the Eagles; York attained over 600 as head coach of the program, and retired with over 1,100 career wins overall, the most by any coach in collegiate history and only one over 1,000.\nTo date, BC has won 14 conference tournament titles, including 12 Hockey East titles, a conference record. Their most recent triumph in 2024 came after beating Boston University 6-2 in the championship game.\nPost-season and Frozen Four.\nBoston College has made 36 NCAA tournament appearances, reaching the tournament's Frozen Four 25 times, second only to Michigan's 26 appearances.\nUnder John \"Snooks\" Kelley, BC advanced to the NCAA tournament three straight years from 1948 to 1950 (when the field was only four teams), winning the National Championship in 1949 after defeating Dartmouth 4–3 in Colorado Springs, CO.\nAfter Jerry York took over as head coach in 1994, the Eagles began to work their way back to the NCAA tournament, having not qualified since 1991, and not having been to a Frozen Four since 1990. In 1998, four years after York became head coach, the Eagles were back in the national championship game, losing to the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey in Boston. BC was back in the national championship game in 2000, facing North Dakota. They lost the game 4–2, but returned the favor a year later in 2001, beating North Dakota 3–2 in overtime thanks to a sensational Krys Kolanos goal. This was the Eagles first national championship since 1949. The championship was all the more satisfying for BC as the Eagles defeated in the process the three teams that had eliminated them from the previous three tournaments (Michigan, Maine, North Dakota). The 2001 National Championship team contained current NHL standouts Brian Gionta, Brooks Orpik, and Chuck Kobasew.\nThe Eagles returned to the national championship game in 2006, facing the Wisconsin Badgers in Milwaukee, WI. The Eagles lost 2–1. A Brian Boyle shot was denied by the post as time expired, securing the win for the Badgers. The Eagles made it back to the national championship game in 2007, riding on the heels of a 13-game winning streak. However, they came up short again, losing 3–1 to the Michigan State Spartans.\nBC got back to the national championship game in 2008, disposing of Minnesota, Miami (OH), and North Dakota in the Frozen Four semifinals along the way. The 2008 tournament marked the third year in a row that the Eagles ending Miami's season, beating the top seeded Red Hawks 4–3 in overtime thanks to an acrobatic goal by freshman Joe Whitney. In the national championship game, the Eagles met the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who had upset Michigan in the other semifinal. The Eagles won the contest by a score of 4–1, behind an MVP performance by Nathan Gerbe. The defeat of the Irish by BC has added fuel to the growing rivalry between Boston College and Notre Dame, carrying over to the ice what has been being fought on the gridiron for years between the two schools' football teams in the Holy War. The hockey rivalry, called the Holy War on Ice added the moniker \"on ice\" in reference to the aforementioned rivalry.\nAfter missing out on the 2009 tournament, BC returned in 2010 as a number one seed. The Eagles defeated Alaska and Yale in the Northeast Regional in Worcester, earning them a berth in the Frozen Four to be played at Ford Field in Detroit. BC defeated Miami (OH) 7–1 in the national semifinal, the fourth time in five years that the Eagles ended the RedHawks' season in the NCAA tournament. BC would face Wisconsin in the championship, a rematch of the 2006 title game. The Eagles avenged that loss by defeating the Badgers 5-0 behind a two-goal effort from sophomore Cam Atkinson and an MVP performance by senior Ben Smith, who would be named the Frozen Four's Most Outstanding Player. Junior John Muse became just the fourth goalie to record a shutout in a title game. The game was played before a record crowd of 37,592, the largest to attend an indoor hockey game.\nAfter a first round loss to Colorado College in the 2011 tournament, BC once again returned to the Frozen Four on the heels of a 15-game winning streak in 2012. After dispatching Air Force and Minnesota-Duluth with two shutouts in the Northeast Regional in Worcester, they advanced to their 23rd Frozen Four played at the Tampa Bay Times Forum in Tampa, Florida. The continued their now 17-game winning streak, making quick work of Minnesota in a 6–1 rout thanks to the efforts of forward Chris Kreider and a 30-save performance by netminder Parker Milner. The Eagles would go on to win the national championship by defeating the Ferris State Bulldogs in a 4–1 victory, featuring a highlight-reel goal by rookie Johnny Gaudreau late in the 3rd to secure the Eagles' fifth national title. Kreider would go on to join the New York Rangers in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, where he would score 5 goals and 7 points before ever playing a regular NHL season game, a feat unaccomplished by any player before him.\nOnce again, the Eagles would continue their every-other-year or even-numbered-years trend by missing out on the Frozen Four in the 2013 tournament via a 5–1 first round loss to Union College and returning the following year in 2014. After defeating Denver 6–2 and UMass Lowell 4–3 in Worcester, the Eagles advanced to their NCAA-leading 24th Frozen Four appearance played at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, having tied the record with Michigan. However, they would not continue to win the championship in their every-other-year trend, as they lost once again to Union in a close 5–4 match. Junior Johnny Gaudreau had a tremendous season, scoring 80 points in 40 games, with a 31-game point streak during the season, and was named the Hobey Baker winner, the third in school history.\nThe Eagles' season in 2014–15 was not up to their usual standards. Despite a respectable 21–14–3 record and finishing 2nd in the conference, the Eagles were bounced out of their 34th NCAA tournament bid in the first round, a 5–2 loss to Denver, who took revenge for the previous year's defeat.\nAgain finding success in even-numbered years, the Eagles advanced to an NCAA-record 25th Frozen Four in 2016 after dispatching Harvard 4–1 and Minnesota-Duluth 3–2 in the Northeast regional, held in Worcester. After heading to Amalie Arena in Tampa, FL for the Frozen Four, however, they would fail to advance to the title game at the hands of the Quinnipiac Bobcats, who defeated the Eagles 3–2 in the programs' first-ever meeting. Junior goaltender Thatcher Demko was named a Hobey Baker hat trick finalist as well as the winner of the Mike Richter Award after leading the NCAA with a school-record 10 shutouts during the season.\n2017 was a down year for the Eagles, as they failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2009. Although, they did finish with a strong 21–15–4 (13–6–3) record and a share of the regular season conference title (shared with UMass Lowell and Boston University). They also made it to the Hockey East tournament championship, but would fall 4–3 to the River Hawks of Lowell, ending their effort to earn an auto-bid into the NCAA tournament.\nSince 1998, the Eagles have qualified for the NCAA tournament 17 times, making it to 12 Frozen Fours, seven National Championship games, and have won four national titles.\nChampionships.\nNational Championships.\nRunners-up in 1965, 1978, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2007 and 2024.\nHockey East Tournament championships.\nRunners-up in 1985, 1986, 1989, 2000, 2006, 2017, and 2019\nHockey East regular-season championships.\n† Shared with New Hampshire‡ Shared with Providence# Shared with Boston University and UMass-Lowell\nRunners-up in 1997–98, 2005–06, 2006–07, 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15\nECAC Tournament championships.\nRunners-up in 1963, 1968, and 1973\nECAC regular-season championships.\n† Shared with Boston University\nRunners-up in 1964–65, 1968–69, 1972–73\nThe Beanpot.\nBC competes in the annual Beanpot tournament with fellow Boston-area schools Boston University, Harvard, and Northeastern. The Eagles have won 20 Beanpots, their most recent being the 2016 tournament that saw the Eagles defeat Boston University.\nRunners-up in 1955, 1970, 1973, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2019\nRivals.\nBoston University Terriers.\nBoston College's chief and biggest rival is the Boston University Terriers, separated by a mere four miles on Boston's Commonwealth Avenue. The rivalry is often referred to as the Green Line Rivalry, as the MBTA Green Line is the principal mode of transportation between the two schools. BC-BU is considered one of the top rivalries in college sports as well as the number one rivalry in college hockey. The schools regularly meet in Hockey East play three times each season. Besides meeting in conference play, the two schools often meet in the annual Beanpot tournament. Although Boston University has historically dominated the tournament, Boston College has commanded the cross town competition in recent years, having won five titles in a row from 2010 to 2014.\nThe two schools have also met in NCAA tournament play. In their most recent meeting, Boston College skated to a memorable 5–0 victory against the top seeded Terriers in the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey tournament Northeast Regional Final. The Eagles and Terriers have met once in the NCAA tournament championship game in 1978, with BU winning 5–3 in Providence, RI. BC and BU have combined for ten national championships, with each school having won five.\nGames between the two schools are also highlighted by the intensity of the two school's student sections, the BC Superfans and the BU Dog Pound. The BU students often shout their infamous \"BC Sucks\" or \"Sunday School\" chants while the Superfans will retort with \"Safety School\", \"Sucks to BU\", or \"BC Rejects\" at their counterparts.\nThe two schools have met on the ice over 250 times, leading the rivalry to be one of the most historic and well known in college hockey. The Terriers have the edge in wins in the series; currently the record sits at 139-133 (with 21 ties).\nBoston College and Boston University faced off in Hockey East play at Fenway Park on January 8, 2010. The game was the first men's college hockey game played at Fenway Park, with a women's game between Northeastern and New Hampshire played earlier in the day. BU edged BC for a 3–2 win.\nNorth Dakota Fighting Hawks.\nBoston College has developed a national rivalry with the North Dakota Fighting Hawks (formerly the Fighting Sioux), a rivalry fueled by each teams post-season success. Boston College ended North Dakota's season in three straight Frozen Fours, most recently winning 6–1 in 2008 en route to a national championship, while in the 2005 tournament the Sioux beat the Eagles in the East Regional finals, 6–3.\nIn 2000, the Sioux triumphed over BC 4–2 in the national championship game in Rhode Island. A year later, in 2001, the Eagles and Hawks met again in Albany, this time with BC prevailing 3–2 in overtime. In 1963, the Sioux beat Boston College by a score of 8–2 in the National Semifinal game. Two years later in 1965, Boston College defeated North Dakota 4–3 in the National Semifinal game.\nOn October 10, 2007, the two teams squared off in a regular season match best remembered for the unusual circumstances in which the game ended. Midway through the second period, the power went out at BC's Conte Forum. When power was restored, the ice surface began to melt, leading to the game being called after two periods due to the hazardous playing conditions. The game ended 0-0.\nThe Eagles and Hawks last met in the championship game of the 2011 Ice Breaker Tournament at the Ralph Engelstad Arena, with BC defeating North Dakota 6–2.\nNew Hampshire Wildcats.\nThe rivalry between Boston College and New Hampshire has grown in recent years due to the success of the two programs. UNH leads the all-time Hockey East regular season series over BC. The Eagles, however, hold a distinct advantage in Hockey East tournament play, holding an 8–3 record. Most recently, in the 2009 Hockey East Tournament, UNH hosted BC in the quarterfinals on their home ice at the Whittemore Center. UNH had the chance to end BC's season and their hopes of reaching the NCAA tournament to defend their national title. BC won the best-of-three series 2–0.\nDuring the 2007–2008 season, the Wildcats swept the season series and won the Hockey East regular season championship. The two teams met in the semifinals of the Hockey East tournament, with the top-seeded and favored UNH squad jumping out to a 4-1 midway through the second period. The Eagles mounted a comeback, however, and won the game 5–4 in triple overtime.\nBoth UNH and BC have also competed closely for the Hockey East regular season championship. In the 2009–2010 season, the Wildcats cemented the title on the final weekend of the season, earning a 3–3 tie against the Eagles at the Whittemore Center in the penultimate game season after BC jumped out to a 3–0 lead. In the 2010–2011 season, the regular season title was again decided on the final weekend, with the Eagles, sitting in second place, sweeping a home-and-home series against the Wildcats, earning their 11th regular season championship.\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish.\nBoston College and Notre Dame first met on the ice in 1969, and have faced-off annually since 1994. BC leads the all-time series 24-21-2, including beating the Irish in the 2008 National Championship game, as the Eagles captured their third national title in a 4–1 victory. After Notre Dame joined Hockey East in 2014, the rivalry evolved into a conference rivalry as well as a school rivalry. In their first meeting as conference foes, Boston College defeated the Irish 4–3 on January 4, 2013, played at Fenway Park during the league's third Frozen Fenway exhibit. The two teams also met in the Hockey East tournament during the Irish's first year of league membership, where Notre Dame defeated the Eagles in the best-of-three Quarterfinals at BC's Kelley Rink. The in-conference rivalry was short-lived however, as the Irish's stay in Hockey East lasted only four season, as they left to join the Big Ten Conference in 2017–18. The teams played 11 games as conference foes, with Notre Dame edging out the Eagles 6-5 during that time.\nThe rivalry is commonly referred to as \"The Holy War on Ice,\" a take on the name of the football rivalry between the two schools.\nAwards and honors.\nNational.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Memorial Award\nMike Richter Award\nTim Taylor Award\nSpencer Penrose Award\nUSCHO Coach of the Year\nUSA Hockey National College Player of the Year\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nNCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll–Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nBest Defensive Forward\nGoaltending Champion\nScoring Champion\nBob Kullen Coach of the Year\nWilliam Flynn Tournament Most Valuable Player\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nStatistical Leaders.\nCareer scoring leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Boston College alumni were a part of an Olympic team."

Code golf challenges and tournaments may also be named with the programming language used (for example, \"Perl golf\").\nEtymology.\nThe term \"code golf\" is derived from the similarity of its goal with that of conventional golf, where participants seek to achieve the lowest possible score, rather than the highest, as is the standard in most sports and game scoring systems. While conventional golf players try to minimize the number of club strokes needed to complete the course, code golfers strive to reduce the number of characters necessary to write the program.\nHistory.\nThe length of the shortest possible program that produces a given output (in any fixed programming language) is known as the Kolmogorov complexity of the output, and its mathematical study dates to the work of Andrey Kolmogorov in 1963. Code golf, however, can be more general than this, as it often specifies a general input-output transformation that must be performed rather than asking for a single output with no input.\nWhilst the term \"code golf\" was apparently first used in 1999 with Perl, and later popularised through the use of Perl to write a program that performed RSA encryption, a similar informal competition is known to have been popular with earlier APL hackers. The challenging nature of aggressively optimizing for program size has itself long been recognized; for example, a 1962 coding manual for Regnecentralen's GIER computer notes that \"it is a time-consuming sport to code with the least possible number of instructions\" and recommends against it for practical programming. Today the term has grown to cover a wide variety of languages, which has even triggered the creation of dedicated golfing languages.\nDedicated golfing languages.\nSeveral new languages have been created specifically with code golfing in mind. Examples include GolfScript, Flogscript, Stuck, and Vyxal, which are Turing-complete languages that provide constructs for concisely expressing ideas in code. Because golfing languages compete for extreme brevity, their design sacrifices readability, which is important for practical production environments, and therefore they are often esoteric. Sometimes, however, a language is designed for a practical purpose but turns out to be suitable for code golf.\nAn example of GolfScript code to print 1000 digits of pi:\n6666,-2%{2+.2/@*\\/10.3??2*+}*\n`1000&lt;~\\;\nThis prints a string starting with \"3141592653\" followed by 990 more digits of pi.\nCode golf websites include novel golfing languages created by users to win code golf challenges. Other popular languages include 05AB1E, Husk, Pyth, CJam and Jelly.\nTypes of code golf.\nSome code golf questions, such as those posed on general programming sites, may not require implementation in a specific programming language. However, this limits the style of problems that it is possible for the problem designers to pose (for example, by limiting the use of certain language features). In addition, the creation of such \"open\" questions has resulted in the design of code golf specific programming language dialects such as REBMU (a dialect of REBOL). Both online and live competitions may also include time limits."

        "text": "Francis Edwin Johnson OAM (1922–1993) was an Australian rugby league footballer, coach and administrator who devoted much of his life to the development of the game in Australia. He was a state and national representative player of the 1940s, and was heavily involved in coaching development in the 1960s and 1970s.\nPlaying career.\nJohnson began his senior career as a sixteen-year-old playing for Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast, He primarily played at and was first selected to represent for NSW Country in 1940. During World War II, Johnson played two excellent seasons with St. George in 1944–1945.\nIn 1946 he returned to the south-coast and captain-coached Wollongong that year. That year he was selected in a Southern Districts representative side who were victorious over the visiting Great Britain tourists\nIn 1947, Johnson was back in Sydney, this time with the Newtown Bluebags. He was selected for the New South Wales team and at the end of the 1948 season he toured with the Kangaroos. Johnson injured his leg early in the tour in England and he participated in only seven tour matches.\nJohnson was captain-coach of the Bluebags in 1952 and in 1953 was a non-playing coach. His attempt to retire from playing was not entirely successful as he was required to fill in on-field occasionally and in 1954 he was persuaded to return as hooker for the season by his coaching successor, Col Geelan. The team made it to the Grand Final but were beaten by Souths and Johnson finally retired from playing.\nPost-playing career.\nJohnson maintained his connection with the game, firstly as a coach with Wollongong Wests in 1957. He coached them to their first premiership win. In 1962, Johnson was a founding member of the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) Coaching Panel and replaced Keith Gittoes as director of coaching in 1974.\nJohnson was responsible for developing coaching and playing skills in Darwin, Northern Territory, and in Papua New Guinea. From 1970 to 1975 he coached the Darwin and Northern Territory teams. It was in his honour that the \"Frank Johnson Medal\", Darwin Rugby League's equivalent of the \"Rothman's Medal\" was named. The medal was first awarded in 1973.\nJohnson was honoured with life membership of the NSWRL in 1982 and received the Order of Australia Medal for services to the sport of Rugby League Football.\nHis nephew John Johnson was for a number of years the A Grade coach for the Palmerston Raiders club in Darwin. Frank's great-nephew Matthew Johnson played for the club and made junior Northern Territory representative appearances."

The club has also only ever had four club professionals, including five time British Open champion James Braid who held the post from 1904 until 1950.\nBoth courses at Walton Heath have been consistently rated in the UK's top 100 courses, with the Old Course also being rated as one of the top 100 in the world.\nTournaments.\nWalton Heath has been the venue of a number of national amateur tournaments and championships. It has also hosted several high profile professional events including the 1981 Ryder Cup, when it stepped in as a replacement venue after construction at The Belfry had not been completed in time. The club also hosted five editions of the European Open, a European Tour event, between 1978 and 1991.\nSince 2005, Walton Heath has been the venue for the U.S. Open European qualifying tournament. In the first year, New Zealander Michael Campbell qualified at Walton Heath, and went on to win the Open at Pinehurst.\nWalton Heath hosted The Senior Open Championship, one of the five majors recognised by the Champions Tour, the world's dominant tour for golfers 50 and older, from 21–24 July 2011.

        "text": "Peter R. Morris (January 1, 1854 – December 9, 1884) was a 19th-century Welsh baseball player. He played in a single game for the Union Association's Washington Nationals on May 14, 1884. Until 2007, little was known about Morris before a writer of the same name discovered biographical information about him.\nCareer.\nMorris played in one major league game in his career. This came on May 14, 1884, as the shortstop for the Washington Nationals of the Union Association. In the game, he recorded no hits in three at-bats and had three assists and an error in the field.\nEarly knowledge.\nAll that was originally known about Morris came from an initial listing in \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\", first published in 1969, for a player known as \"P. Morris\". This player was said to have been born in Rockford, Illinois. This entry, with the Rockford birthplace and the lack of a first name, persisted in the \"Total Baseball\" books of later vintage.\nDiscovery.\nIn 2007, a writer for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), coincidentally also named Peter Morris, discovered newly researched information on the ballplayer. The writer Morris found that the ballplayer Morris was also named Peter, learned his middle initial, and that he was born in Rhuddlan in Wales on January 1, 1854. This made Morris the first major leaguer from Wales, predating Ted Lewis by 12 years.\nThe ballplayer was listed as having been a reserve player for the independent Milwaukee Maple Leafs baseball club in 1883 and 1884. In learning about the ballplayer, the writer Morris found a mention of the Maple Leafs playing a series hosted by a team from Chicago on May 13. The ballplayer Morris started every game of that series save for one. The only game he did not start was on May 14, the date the previously known \"P. Morris\" appeared in a game for the Nationals, an away game against the Chicago Browns, another Union Association team. As the Nationals were known to have a link to the Milwaukee club, it was surmised by the writer Morris and SABR editor Bill Carle that the player who appeared for Washington on the 14th was indeed the ballplayer Peter Morris. In the same discovery, the writer found that the ballplayer died nearly seven months later, on December 9, in a railway coupling accident, and was buried in Ixonia, Wisconsin.\nLater research.\nIn his 2013 book, \"Cracking Baseball's Cold Cases\", the writer Morris included further information on his search for the ballplayer. He found that the ballplayer had likely played for the Aetna Club of Detroit in the 1870s, and later played briefly for the Stillwater, Minnesota club of the Northwestern League three months after his time representing Washington before rejoining the Maple Leafs. The research on the ballplayer Morris led to the writer also obtaining a copy of the ballplayer's birth certificate from Wales."

Selected after just one season at Mt. San Antonio College, he was placed on the fast track to the majors, and was the youngest player in the major leagues when he debuted in 1976. On June 22 of that year, he hit a rare inside-the-park grand slam home run against Steve Busby of the Kansas City Royals, and he finished that season with a .248 batting average and 5 home runs in 230 at bats.\nDespite his young age, Bell never really developed beyond that. After two more years spent mostly in the minor leagues, he had a season very similar to '76 in 1979, when he batted .245 with 4 home runs in 200 at bats. In 1980, he regressed to a .178 average, and he was released by the White Sox after the season.\nBell was picked up by the San Diego Padres, but before the 1981 season had even begun, he was shipped off to the Oakland Athletics along with two minor leaguers in exchange for pitcher Bob Lacey. One of those minor leaguers would turn out to be long-time A's star Tony Phillips. Bell himself fared less well, getting just 9 more at bats in the majors in 1982 before calling it a career."

Initially, it was intended that they play four Test matches, one Twenty20 International and five One Day Internationals against the West Indies cricket team. However, the abandonment of the Second Test due to the conditions of the field at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five-match, rather than four-match Test series. The West Indies regained the Wisden Trophy by winning the Test series 1–0. They also won the Twenty20 match, but England won the ODI series 3–2.\nBuild-up.\nDespite recent turmoils, England went into the series as firm favourite. The players claimed confidence, the ICC rankings placed them comfortably ahead of their adversaries, and the pundits were, under the circumstances, fairly buoyant. In \"The Daily Telegraph\", Geoffrey Boycott opined that, with a fit Andrew Flintoff, England ought to prevail easily:\nI am not saying it will be a walkover. The one thing England do need is a fit Andrew Flintoff, throughout all the four Tests. If Freddie goes down injured, the odds for the series will turn around dramatically."

        "title": "Brad Scott (American football)",
        "text": "Harvey Bradford \"Brad\" Scott (born September 30, 1954) is a former American football coach and player who was most recently the football chief of staff for the University of South Florida Bulls football team. He was previously the associate head coach and offensive line coach for the Clemson Tigers football team and was also the head coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks from 1994 to 1998.\nCareer.\nScott came to South Carolina after 11 years as an assistant at Florida State under Bobby Bowden, the last four as offensive coordinator. While at Florida State, he helped develop Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward, as well as the \"Fast Break\" offense that netted the Seminoles a national title in 1993.\nIn his first year at South Carolina, he led the Gamecocks to a 6–5 regular season. Despite a 4–4 record in Southeastern Conference play, Scott's Gamecocks routed Clemson 33–7 in the last game of the season. That earned them a berth in the Carquest Bowl, where they beat West Virginia 24–21. It was the first bowl win in the program's 102-year history—one of the longest droughts in the country at the time.\nScott's tenure at South Carolina would prove to be short-lived, as he was only able to put together one more winning season, in 1996—only the second year he managed a .500 record in conference play. In 1998, after defeating Ball State to open the season, the Gamecocks lost 10 games in a row to finish 1–10, the worst record in school history at the time. Scott was fired after the 1998 season. Shortly afterward, he was hired as tight ends coach by in-state rival Clemson, which was coached at the time by Tommy Bowden, Bobby Bowden's younger son. Scott was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2001, a job he held for three seasons. Scott was then demoted to offensive line coach after the 2003 season.\nAfter Tommy Bowden was forced to resign in the middle of the 2008 season, Scott was named associate head coach under new head coach Dabo Swinney.\nIn 2020 he left Clemson with his son and joined the USF staff. Brad vacated the position following Jeff Scott's firing after the 2022 season.\nPersonal life.\nScott's son, Jeff, was a wide receiver at Clemson when Brad was the offensive coordinator for the Tigers and was the head coach for the University of South Florida's football team from 2020 to 2022."

        "title": "List of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball seasons",
        "text": "The men's basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is referred to as the North Carolina Tar Heels, and they play in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The Tar Heels have played their games at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina since 1986.\nAs of the 2009–10 season, North Carolina had the second most wins and the second highest winning percentage of any NCAA Division I men's team with a record of 2,004 wins and 720 losses over 100 seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 seasons from the 1970–71 season through 2000–01 season. The Tar Heels have won the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament six times, have appeared in the tournament finals eleven times, a record 21 NCAA Final Fours, have made it into the NCAA tournament 47 times (tied for second-most all-time), and hold the record for all-time NCAA tournament victories (102).\nAdditionally, the team has been the number one seed in the NCAA tournament 13 times, which is the most #1 seeds of all-time, and has been ranked in the top 25 AP Poll 703 times (1st all-time), has beaten #1 teams a record 12 times, has the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31, North Carolina has also won the National Invitation Tournament, appeared in two NIT Semifinals, and has made five appearances in the NIT Tournament. North Carolina has had a top twenty-five final ranking among Division I schools 42 times as ranked by the Associated Press and 44 times as ranked by the Coaches Poll. In five instances the Tar Heels have ended the season with a number one ranking in the Associated Press, and the Tar Heels have also been ranked number one five times at the end of the season by the Coaches' Poll.\nThe Tar Heels played their first basketball game against Virginia Christian, on January 27, 1910, a 42–21 win for North Carolina. In 1921 North Carolina joined the Southern Conference. In the Southern Conference, the Tar Heels quickly found success. The 1923–24 Tar Heels squad went 26-0 and was retroactively awarded the national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1936. Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels were winners of the regular season for nine times and won the Southern Conference championships 8 times.\nIn 1953, North Carolina split off from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Again, the Tar Heels quickly found success in their new conference. The Tar Heels won their first NCAA Championship under coach Frank McGuire in 1957, which was led by Lennie Rosenbluth and several other transplants from the New York City area. McGuire was forced to resign in 1961 after an NCAA violation regarding \"improper recruiting entertainment\" and was replaced by one of his assistants, Dean Smith.\nSmith coached the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997 and brought an unprecedented level of success to the team. When Smith retired in 1997, he had the most wins ever of any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach with 879 wins, and the 9th highest winning percentage with 77.6% wins. During Smith's time as head coach, North Carolina won the ACC regular season championship 17 times, won the ACC tournament 13 times, won the NIT in 1971, went to the NCAA tournament 27 times, appeared in 11 final fours, and won two NCAA national tournament titles, in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 National Championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan. The 1993 National Championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player Charlie Scott.\nSmith retired in 1997 and the head coaching position went to his assistant Bill Guthridge. In his three seasons as head coach Guthridge led the Tar Heels to the NCAA final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament.\nGuthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to the 38-year-old Matt Doherty to lead the Tar Heels. Doherty had mixed success while at Carolina. In his first season, the Heels shot to the #1 ranking in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with an impressive 26–7 record. But Doherty's second season was the worst in recent history as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8-20, missing postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965–66 season (including a record 26 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finishing with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4–12 in the ACC—only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play, and placed them in a tie for 7th place—the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC. After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002–03 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. Carolina went on to finish the season with a 17–15 record, barely missing the NCAA tournament. Matt Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown. Despite the turnaround from the year before and the late season playoff run, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams.\nRoy Williams' first season was a moderate success with North Carolina finished 19-11 and the team was knocked out in the second round of the NCAA tournament by Texas. Williams was able to gain more success in his second season and coached North Carolina to a national championship in 2005. After winning the championship, Williams had to deal with the departure of the team's top seven scorers. Most thought that 2005–06 would be a down season for Williams, but the Tar Heels proved to be surprisingly successful in part due to the help of the freshman Tyler Hansbrough. Williams was named Coach of the Year for his ability to turn around such a new team to such a high level of success. Since 2005 the Tar Heels have once again become a leader in the ACC, winning both the regular season and the conference tournament in 2006–07 and 2007–08. In the 2008–09 season, North Carolina was chosen as consensus pre-season #1 and managed to fulfill the predictions of a national championship by beating Michigan State in the 2009 National Championship. However, the 2009-10 season ended up being a down season for the Tar Heels. The loss of players such as Ty Lawson and Tyler Hansbrough, along with numerous injuries to key players, proved too much to overcome and resulted in the Tar Heels missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2002–03 season. The Tar Heels returned to the NCAA tournament in the ensuring years losing to Kentucky and Kansas in the Elite 8 during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons respectively. In the 2015-16 season, Williams returned the Tar Heels to the NCAA Championship game where he sought his third national championship against Villanova. Marcus Paige hit an off-balance three-point shot to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. However, Villanova's Kris Jenkins hit a buzzer-beating three pointer to defeat the Tar Heels 77–74. The Tar Heels returned to the 2017 National Championship game the following year where they defeated Gonzaga 71–65 to win their sixth NCAA title in program history.\nPostseason playoff results.\nThe NCAA tournament started in 1939 and the number of teams invited to participate has expanded a number of times over the years. Between 1939 and 1950 the tournament had only eight teams, and then between 1951 and 1974 the tournament varied between 16 teams and 25 teams. The tournament has continued to expand over the years, and there are now 68 teams that make it into the tournament. From 1941 to 1981, a third-place game was played as part of the Final Four.\nThe National Invitation Tournament, meanwhile, began in 1938 with only 6 teams. In 1941 the tournament was expanded to include 8 teams, in 1949 the tournament was again expanded to 12 teams, then 14 teams in 1965, 16 teams in 1968, 24 teams in 1979, 32 teams in 1980, and 40 teams from 2002 through 2006. The tournament reverted to 32 teams for 2007.\nOver Tournament Record: \nNCAA: 133-49 .730\nNIT: 12-5 .705\nNCAA Tournament Record by Seed: \nNCAA Tournament Record by Region: \nEast (27 times): 75-27 .735 (includes Final Four consolation games)\nWest (8 times): 14-8 .636\nSouth (6 times): 18-4 .818\nSoutheast (4 times): 11-4 .733\nMidwest (4 times): 7-4 .636\nSyracuse (1 time): 6-0 1.000\nAtlanta (1 time): 1-1 .500\nWashington D.C.

They were the eighth All Black team to undertake a full tour of the countries and became the first to achieve a Grand Slam by beating the national teams of Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland. The previous seven touring teams had either lost or drawn at least one international, or had not played all four nations.\nThe New Zealand team played eighteen matches between 18 October and 16 December, winning seventeen games and losing once, to Munster at Thomond Park, Limerick. This was the first time that an All Black team had been beaten in Ireland and it remained the All Blacks' only defeat by any Irish team until they lost to the Ireland national team in 2016. The Munster victory inspired a stage play, \"Alone it Stands\".\nAlthough the All Blacks won their four international matches, three of the games were undecided until close to the end. The match against Ireland was level 6–6 at the end of normal time and was settled by Andy Dalton's try in injury time. Against Wales, a 78th-minute penalty goal by replacement full-back Brian McKechnie turned a 12–10 deficit into a 13–12 win. In the Scotland game the All Blacks led 12–9 going into injury time and a drop goal attempt by Ian McGeechan, which would have tied the scores if successful, was charged down and led to a breakaway try for New Zealand by Bruce Robertson.\nTest matches.\nIreland.\nThe All Blacks opened the scoring with a dropped goal by Bruce, with Ward's penalty making the score 3–3 at half-time. Bruce put the visitors ahead again with a further dropped goal before Ward levelled again with another penalty. The score remained at 6–6 as the game went into injury time but an unconverted try by Dalton after Donaldson's break from a line-out gave New Zealand a 10–6 victory. Rothmans Yearbook called it a \"tense, if unspectacular, struggle in perfect playing conditions\" and asserted that the All Blacks \"deserved their narrow victory\" after winning 31 of the 40 line-outs in the game.\nTouring party.\nFull back.\nClive Currie, Brian McKechnie, Richard Wilson\nThree-quarters.\nStu Wilson, Robert Kururangi, Brian Ford, Bryan Williams, Bruce Robertson, Lyn Jaffray, Mark Taylor, Bill Osborne\nHalf-backs.\nDoug Bruce, Eddie Dunn, Dave Loveridge, Mark Donaldson\nForwards.\nBrad Johnstone, John Ashworth, John McEldowney, Gary Knight, Andy Dalton, John Black, Billy Bush, John Fleming, John Loveday, Andy Haden, Frank Oliver, Barry Ashworth, Leicester Rutledge, Graham Mourie, Wayne Graham, Gary Seear, Ash McGregor"

Coaching decisions such as line changes and strategy choices can be made during a game between whistles. Player creation, development and trades all take place before and after games.\nGameplay as a centre was limited due to only having one action button, this meant that when playing as a centre, pressing the \"fire\" button would cause the player to swing his stick. If the player had possession of the puck this would result in a shot. Swinging the stick with or without the puck also had the potential to knock other players down depending on their proximity to the swinging stick, often resulting in a penalty, if no penalty is called the player knocked down would spin for several seconds before getting back up (if you as the centre were knocked down you were effectively out of the play until you regained your feet).\nThe game was notable for its player creation and development system, the game used \"trade points\" as a measure of value when creating new players, trading players and running team practices. Players also aged and their skills declined, the most noticeable being speed.\nReception.\n\"Superstar Ice Hockey\" was Mindscape's third best-selling Commodore game of all time as of late 1987."

        "text": "Thomas William Rory Pearson (10 May 1872 – 12 September 1957) was a Welsh international wing who played club rugby for Cardiff and Newport and county rugby with Middlesex. He won 13 caps for Wales and captained the team on one occasion, against England. Pearson was an all-round sportsman, representing Wales not only in rugby, but also in squash, tennis, hockey and golf. In 1902 Pearson was given the captaincy of the Welsh hockey squad, while playing for Newport Hockey Club.\nDuring World War I he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Field Artillery.\nRugby career.\nPearson was born in Bombay, but moved to England at the age of five. By 1889 he had moved to Wales and was living in the capital, joining Cardiff Rugby Club.\nPearson gained his first cap for Wales while playing with Cardiff in 1891. His debut was against England on 3 January at Rodney Parade and Wales lost 7-3, though Pearson scored a try for Wales. This try made Pearson the youngest player to score a try for Wales at 18 years and 238 days until overtaken by Tom Prydie in 2010. Pearson's try also made him the youngest player to score a try on his Wales debut until George North surpassed the record in 2010. \nPearson was dropped after the 1892 Championship and did not regain his Wales place until the end of 1894 tournament, an unusual situation as during 1892/93 season, he scored a record 40 tries for Cardiff, a club record. He played fairly frequently for Wales through to 1898, but in 1903, with his international career supposedly far behind him, he was recalled to captain Wales against England. Pearson had already scored a try when he was forced to leave the field after a particularly heavy tackle from Harry Gamlin. His replacement, Jehoida Hodges scored a hat-trick of tries. Pearson played a total of 13 matches for his country.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The Women's Pole Vault event at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany was held between 15 August and 17 August 2009. Yelena Isinbayeva was the strong favourite prior to the competition, a position enhanced further by the withdrawal of 2008 Olympic silver medallist Jennifer Stuczynski. Anna Rogowska was the only athlete to beat Isinbayeva in the buildup to the event. Fabiana Murer and Monika Pyrek had both registered strong season's bests but had suffered from indifferent form. European Indoor medallists Yuliya Golubchikova and Silke Spiegelburg rounded out the list of the season's highest jumping athletes.\nIn the qualifiers, the automatic progression mark of 4.60 m was not needed, as eleven athletes reached 4.55 m and Kristina Gadschiew progressed with 4.50 m. All four Russian athletes reached the final, as did all three vaulters of the host nation's team. Veteran American athlete and former world record holder Stacy Dragila closed her major championship career with a jump of 4.25 m, as she announced her intention to retire at the end of the season.\nOn the final day of the event, European Indoor champion Golubchikova was the first to experience disappointment, as a fall in the warm up left her unable to compete in the final. The Brazilian and British champions, Murer and Kate Dennison failed at the 4.65 m mark. Pyrek and American Chelsea Johnson passed that height on their first attempt, while Rogowska and home favourite Spiegelburg completed it on their second try. Rogowska was the only athlete to vault 4.75 m, at which point reigning champion Isinbayeva entered the competition. The Russian failed to clear the height and, after raising the bar, failed twice more and finished last in the competition.\nGiven that Isinbayeva had a season's best of 4.80 m, an opener of 4.75 m was a risky decision that back fired for the athlete, resulting in her first major championship loss since 2003 and her first ever non-medalling performance in international competition. Rogowska, who had beaten her at the London Grand Prix a month earlier, won her first gold medal at a major championships, breaking Isinbayeva's dominance of the event. Pyrek repeated her form of the 2005 Championships to take a silver medal along with Chelsea Johnson, a relatively unknown athlete competing at her first major championships. For the first time in history of World Championships in Athletics, two Polish athletes took gold and silver medal in the same event.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 4.60 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nKey: NM = no mark (i.e. no valid result), NR = National record, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: DNS = Did not start, NM = no mark (i.e. no valid result), SB = Seasonal best"

He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School; University College, Cardiff, where he took a BSc in 1963; and Merton College, Oxford (1963-4). Whilst at Oxford he played for Oxford University RFC.\nRugby career.\nHe was capped fourteen times by Wales as a centre between 1962 and 1966.[3] He scored five tries for Wales. He was selected for Wales' first overseas tour in 1964 and played in the Welsh rugby team's first match outside of Europe (and its first in the Southern Hemisphere) against East Africa in Nairobi on 12 May 1964, Wales winning 8-26.\nJones was only 21 when selected for the 1962 British Lions tour to South Africa and played in the first three internationals, scoring one try. He stayed in South Africa after the 1962 tour where he played for Paarl. He was also selected for the 1966 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand, and played in both internationals against Australia and the first international against the All Blacks, scoring two tries in the latter match. He also toured South Africa with Wales in 1964.\nAs a student he was offered a professional contract by Leeds rugby league and again by St George in Australia during the 1966 Lions tour but resolved to stay in rugby union on both occasions. Leeds offer of £12,000 would have been a world record fee at the time. Jones retired from rugby at 27 having played club rugby for Llanelli and Cardiff where he spent 5 years at each club.\nAfter retirement from rugby at 27, Jones worked for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in Wales as part of a team charged with attracting inward investment from Japanese corporates into Wales. Jones helped bring Takiron (the plastics subsidiary of Itochu, one of Japan’s biggest trading companies) to Wales where he joined as MD before subsequently becoming its Chairman. Jones was on the board of governors of Cardiff University and the University of Wales, as well as Chairman of governors of the Museum of Welsh Life, St Fagans and a council member of the National Museum of Wales.\nPersonal life and death.\nJones had two children, Mark and Sara. He died on 24 August 2022, at the age of 81."

        "title": "Marlow Rowing Club",
        "text": "Marlow Rowing Club is a rowing club on the River Thames in England, on the southern bank of the Thames at Bisham in Berkshire, opposite the town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire just beside Marlow Bridge and on the reach above Marlow Lock. Founded in 1871, it is one of the main rowing and sculling centres in England. Members of the club have represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games and World Championships.\nHistory.\nThe local football club Marlow F.C. was founded at a dinner at Compleat Angler Hotel in 1870. At a football club dinner at the Angler, members decided that what the town needed next was a rowing club, and further meetings were held to found one, which happened on 16 May 1871. Rowing was already established in the town, and the Marlow Regatta, a separate organisation to the rowing club, had been running since around 1855. Initially the club had no home and rowers sheltered under Marlow Bridge on the Buckinghamshire side, but when the freeholder died in 1888 they had to move to Meakes and Redknap boathouse on the other side of the river. In 1892 Edward Riley offered to allow the use of his land just above the Meakes boathouse, by 1896 Mr Wethered, the club captain (from the local brewery family) obtained a lease from Mr Ward, a life tenant of the site that the club now occupies. The clubhouse was complete in 1896 and formally opened in 1897. Ward died 10 years later, but the new owner, Mr Borgnis, granted a new lease the club remained a tenant of sympathetic landlords until it acquired the freehold following the 2011 fire. The neighbouring land was acquired from Sir James Boyton (who still has a boat named after him).\nDuring the early years of the club, the Town Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta was a trophy that many of the Upper Thames clubs wanted, and Marlow entered every year from 1871 (except 1879) until it was withdrawn in 1883, and it won 6 times. The club competed at many local regattas.\nDuring the World War I the club lost many members to the war including most of the first eight which had won at many local regattas, and played host to disabled servicemen and a guards regiment which had been garrisoned nearby.\nMarlow first competed in the Head of the River Race in 1932, and lost further members in World War II.\nBy the 1950s the club was strong, with Mike Spracklen, later an internationally famous coach, as captain in 1959. The club had reached the finals of the Wyfolds in 1954, and in 1959 it won 20 trophies. In 1958 Mike Spracklen and Geoff Baker had won gold medals in the Empire Games 2x event.\nBy the 1960s and 1970s the club was small in numbers, but in 1978 a local junior, Steve Redgrave started his career with the club. With Steve the club won its first Henley trophy in a long time when 1981 Steve and Eric Sims won the 2x event, which he repeated with Adam Clift. Redgrave won many other trophies at Henley and went on to be the UK's most successful rowing Olympian. He is now club president of Marlow Rowing Club and Chairman of Henley Royal Regatta. Mike Spracklen set up the GB training centre at Leander Club, but that catered for men only. The women's rowing set-up was based at Longridge and Marlow offered a home to the first tier of women's rowing. This led the club to have an exceptional women's presence in the late 1980s and 1990s: Gillian Lindsay won the (2x) World Championships in 1998, Alex Beever, Lisa Eyre and Sue Walker were World Champions in the 4- and bronze medallists in the 8o, Cath Bishop was British and World record holder, silver medallist in the 2- in 1997 and won the Paris world Cup in 1998. Twelve athletes from MRC prepared for the Sydney Olympics. The late 1990s also saw the early stages of the careers of Sarah Winckless and Katherine Grainger, both club members who went on to World and Olympic medals. Ann Redgrave was MRC's first female captain in 1989, as well as being an Olympic rower in her own right. As women's rowing has been fully integrated into the British Rowing system Marlow has lost this stream of highly talented women.\nHowever, with Adaptive (Pararowing) on the rise Marlow had a Paralypian in the form of Naomi Riches and now has other pararowers as members as part of the national development scheme.\nThe club now has a strong junior section, with around 500 members aged 11 to 90.\nFire and rebuild.\nThe club was seriously damaged by a fire on 3 August 2011. The 1896 building was damaged beyond the repair and the 1970s building warped by heat. The decision was taken to demolish and start again. The club operated out of the 1970s building, and at temporary gyms first in a tent at Bisham Abbey and near Marlow railway station, and boating sites at Marlow Sailing Club, Bisham Abbey, the Compleat Angler Hotel, Longridge Activity Centre, Cookham Reach Sailing club and Westhorpe watersports centre.\nDisruption to rowing was kept to a minimum and the junior section won the National Schools Championship, the British Championships and the National Sculling Head in 2012, with the coaching team winning a national award.\nFollowing fundraising and a grant of £1million from Sport England the club reached a fundraising target of around £2.6 million and was substantially rebuilt expanding from four boat bays to five, doubling the gym space and with a third floor bar facility.\nThe club itself has converted into a registered charity (it was previously a Community Amateur Sports Club) and it has been selected as a British Rowing hub for the para-rowing element of the Elite Talent Development Pathway.\nThe new clubhouse was opened by club President Steve Redgrave and international coach and MRC member Mike Spracklen in September 2015, at an event attended by local MP (and later PM) Theresa May.\nRiver.\nThe club rows from Marlow up to Temple Lock (approximately 2 km), and from below Marlow Lock down to Cookham (approximately 5 km). The former stretch is the home of Marlow Town Regatta, Marlow Spring Regatta and FirstRow Challenge, and the latter the setting for Marlow Long Distance Sculls and the (discontinued) Marlow Fours and Pairs. The Marlow Regatta moved to Dorney Lake in 2001.\nOff the water the club also runs the \"Rower's Revenge\" Triathlon which consists of rowing machines, cycling and running and was held in October each year for around 15 years. It was then transferred to an events company but from 2016 returned to the rowing club and moved to August. From 2017 it will contain an event for disabled athletes, comprising 4 km on a rowing machine (as per the general event), plus 15 km hand cycle and 1.5 km wheelchair race.\nColours.\nThe club colour is cardinal.\nThe colour scheme was chosen early in the club's history with the club's 1884 rules declaring simply as rule 7 \"The Colour of the club shall be cardinal\". Bylaw 1 provided more detail: \"It shall be compulsory for Members rowing in Regattas or Matches to wear the Club uniform, as follows - Jacket: Dark Blue, Swan worked in Cardinal on breast pocket, Cap - Dark Blue, swan worked in Cardinal on front, Staw Hat, Dark blue ribbon, swan worked in cardinal on front, Jersey - White, trimmed cardinal. Members who have been selected to row in regattas shall, and members who have rowed in regattas may, have their coats trimmed in cardinal.\"\nThis colour scheme has largely survived, with modern all-in-ones are maroon with a white stripe down the side and the club crest on the front. Shirts are white with a maroon stripe on the arm and the word \"Marlow\" picked out in white lettering. Leggings are black with a maroon stripe down the side. The colour scheme is not dissimilar to that of Vesta Rowing Club or Oxford Brookes University.\nClub blazers come in two forms - original blue as described, and a white variant. There are photos of members in the 19th century wearing the white version. \nRelationships with other clubs and organisations.\nMarlow Rowing Club's building is also used by Marlow Canoe Club, Longridge Canoe Club, Henley Open Water Swimming Club and a local triathlon club. It was previously a base for local schools but they moved to Longridge.\nThe bar is run by a trading company owned by the rowing club (which is a charity) and is open to the public on a limited basis.\nThe club is a base for the British Rowing talent development pathway for Adaptive rowing (or Pararowing) and many members of the BR Para squad are members.\nDuring the annual Swan Upping on the Thames, the Swan Uppers leave their boats at Marlow RC overnight.\nThe club is twinned with Rowing Club de Port Marly, in France which is the rowing club in Marly-le-Roi that Marlow, Buckinghamshire is twinned with."
