        "text": "William \"Mother\" Elliot , also known as Bill, (9 May 1867 – 16 April 1958) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer who toured with the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team. Elliot was one of five Pākehā (European) players in the predominantly Māori team, and his addition strengthened the side. Playing at half-back, he became one of the most prolific players on the tour, and appeared in at least 86 of their 107 matches in the British Isles, Australia and New Zealand. While on tour he played in all three of the internationals against England, Ireland, and Wales. When he returned from the tour he continued to play provincial rugby for Auckland, whom he represented from 1887 to 1896. Before he departed with the Natives he had twice represented Auckland against the touring British side, and had scored a try against them in the second match, a 4–0 victory for Auckland. He was initially selected for New Zealand for their 1893 tour of Australia, but was unable to secure leave from work."

        "text": "Jonathan Phillips (born 14 July 1982) is a Welsh former professional ice hockey forward who last played for and captained the Sheffield Steelers in the EIHL. \nPhillips also captained the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team from 2012–2023 and passed 100 senior caps at the 2021 IIHF World Championship. \nIn May 2022, Phillips passed Ashley Tait for the most senior Great Britain ice hockey caps with 111, achieving the feat at the 2022 IIHF World Championship.\nCareer.\nPhillips played both football and ice hockey growing up, however by the age of 11 he fully committed to ice hockey. He caught the attention of Cardiff Devils's coach Paul Heavey while playing for Great Britain's Under 18 and Under 20 International team, and was named to his squad for 1999-00 season. He spent three seasons with the Devils in the Elite Ice Hockey League before joining the Sheffield Steelers under coach Dave Matsos. In his first season with the Steelers, he was named an alternate captain before being promoted to captain midway through the season after Shawn Maltby was injured. During his first three seasons, Phillips led the team to two Playoff Championships and League title. In September 2011, Phillips underwent surgery to repair damaged knee ligaments.\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Phillips lost his captaincy to Stephen Goertzen but it was returned the following season. In April 2017, Phillips helped lead the Steelers to two milestones. He became the most-capped Sheffield Steelers player in history and also helped the team become the second in UK history to record ten playoff wins. After re-signing with the team, he set another milestone by becoming the first EIHL player to reach 1000 games played.\nPhillips initially agreed to re-sign with the Sheffield Steelers in 2020 for a 15th year, however after the 2020–21 Elite League season was suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic, he moved to the German Oberliga side EHF Passau Black Hawks in November 2020.\nIn February 2021, Phillips returned to the UK to sign for NIHL side Sheffield Steeldogs ahead of their Spring Cup series. He then rejoined the Sheffield Steelers ahead of the Elite Series in April 2021.\nIn February 2023, Phillips announced the 2022–23 season would be his last as a professional ice hockey player. He made his final Sheffield Steelers appearance on 16 April 2023, a 7-4 victory over the Nottingham Panthers in the Elite League third/fourth place play-off. \nHis final professional game - and record-extending 116th senior appearance for Great Britain - was the 2023 IIHF World Championship Division I decider on home ice against Italy at Motorpoint Arena Nottingham on 5 May 2023, with Phillips again as captain. GB won 5-3 to win promotion back to the top tier of the IIHF World Championship.\nPersonal life.\nPhillips met his wife Kirsty in 2000 and they married in 2012."

He nevertheless uses his remaining hand to work wonders when polishing high quality lenses and mirrors for astronomical telescopes. Later on, when living in what had become Nazi Germany, he himself invents large stellar telescopes that are still to be found at, for instance, the Mount Palomar Observatory in California and on the island of Mallorca. Schmidt has to wrestle with his conscience when living in Germany as the country is re-arming and telescopes could be put to military use. But because Germany was the leading technical nation at the time, he feels reasonably comfortable there, first in the run-down small town of Mittweida, then at the main Bergedorf Observatory just outside Hamburg. But the rise of the Nazis is literally driving him mad."

        "text": "Leon Michael Brown (born 26 October 1996) is a Welsh professional rugby union player who plays as a prop for United Rugby Championship club Dragons and the Wales national team.\nClub career.\nBrown began playing rugby for St Joseph's youth side, before attending St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School and Newport High School. Brown was involved with the Dragons Academy, first appearing for the U16 side as a replacement against the Ospreys in 2012. While playing for feeder club Cross Keys, Brown was named Player of the Month for October 2015.\nPrior to making his first team debut, Brown played for the Dragons Premiership Select team in the British and Irish Cup.\nOn 12 November 2016, Brown made his debut for the Dragons, coming on as a replacement against Leicester Tigers in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. He made his first start the following week, against the Scarlets. He scored his first try on 27 October 2017 against the Ospreys. Brown signed a contract extension in late 2017, having just been selected to the Welsh squad for the forthcoming Autumn series.\nBrown scored against the Ospreys on 4 January 2020, helping the Dragons to a 25–18 win. He scored again against the Ospreys on 23 August 2020, as the Dragons came back to earn a last minute 20–20 draw. Brown was named in the 2019–2020 Pro14 Dream Team, only the second time a Dragons player had been chosen in the team.\nBrown signed an extension with the Dragons in 2021, turning down interest from Premiership clubs Exeter and Gloucester.\nHaving dealt with a nerve injury on and off for two years, he underwent surgery in 2022 to correct the issue. This led to nine additional months on the sidelines as he healed, but Brown made a successful return to fitness in early 2023, appearing off the bench for the Dragons against the Lions. Another neck and shoulder injury caused him to miss the final match of the season.\nInternational career.\nBrown represented Wales at all age grades: U16, U18, and U20. Brown was selected in the Wales U18 side that toured South Africa in 2015. In 2016, Brown was part of the Wales U20 team that won a Six Nations Grand Slam.\nIn August 2016 Brown was selected for the senior Wales training squad ahead of the Autumn international series. He was included in the Wales players squad for the 2017 Autumn internationals. Brown made his Wales senior debut on 10 November 2017 versus Australia as a second half substitute. The following week, he made his first start, as Wales beat Georgia.\nBrown was selected in the initial 42–man training squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and played in a summer friendly against Ireland, but did not make the final squad for the tournament. He was brought back into the Wales team by new head coach Wayne Pivac for the friendly against the Barbarians, and was named on the bench for the fixture.\nDuring the 2021 Six Nations Championship, Brown came off the bench in every match, winning the Championship title as well as the Triple Crown. He was selected for the 2021 Summer tests, starting in the final match against Argentina.\nBrown was initially selected for the 2022 Wales rugby union tour of South Africa, but ruled out due to injury. This injury would further rule him out of the 2022 Autumn test matches. Upon returning to fitness, Brown was selected in the squad for the 2023 Six Nations Championship. Brown made one appearance, coming off the bench against Scotland on 11 February 2023.\nBrown was not selected for the extended Wales training squad ahead of the 2023 Rugby World Cup."

Two more rinks have recently opened, the Gardenice Rink (800 square meters) in Bandung and the BX Rink (24-by-55-meters) at the Bintaro Jaya Xchange Mall in Tangsel.

        "text": "In 2017, Hampshire County Cricket Club will compete in Division One of the County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup and the NatWest t20 Blast.\nSquad.\nDepartures.\nLeft-arm medium bowler James Tomlinson and right-arm medium bowler Andy Carter both retired at the end of the 2016 season, although Carter later joined Northamptonshire. Wicket-keeper Adam Wheater left the club to join Essex in September 2016 after being released with a year left on his contract. South African all-rounder Ryan McLaren left Hampshire to join Lancashire in October 2016.\nIn March 2017, former England U19 captain Joe Weatherley signed a new contract with Hampshire. As part of this deal, he agreed to move on loan for the 2017 season to Kent, although he was recalled in August due to a spate of injuries. Fast bowlers Gareth Andrew, Tino Best and Yasir Arafat (who had been on loan at Somerset in 2016) all were released after short term deals, along with David Wainwright. Gavin Griffiths who had been on loan at the club, joined Leicestershire, while Craig Young did not have his loan extended either. Overseas player Darren Sammy will not be returning in 2017. In late August, Michael Carberry was loaned to Leicestershire for first-class cricket.\nArrivals.\nIn September 2017, Hampshire signed young all-rounder Asher Hart from Durham's academy. In October 2016, young all-rounder Fraser Hay was awarded a summer contract for 2017, having impressed in the academy.\nIn January 2017, South Africans Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw both quit international cricket and subsequently signed for Hampshire on Kolpak contracts. George Bailey returned to the side on a two-year deal as overseas player, having previously played for the club as overseas in the 2013 season. Australian Ian Holland also joined the club during April, having played for the Second XI during the 2016 and early 2017 season. Youngsters Calvin Dickinson, Ben Duggan, Jake Goodwin and Josh McCoy all signed Hampshire scholarships with the side for the 2017 season after their performances for the Academy and Second XI, while Felix Organ, on an academy contract, represented the first team in September. Former Essex bowler Matt Salisbury joined the club on trial following some impressive performances in the Second XI. Wiltshire spinner Jake Lintott joined the team in August while Mason Crane was on international duty.\nCounty Championship.\nHampshire will play 14 County Championship Division One matches in 2017. The Championship has been restructured for 2017, with Division One having eight teams, leaving the remaining ten counties in Division Two instead of the previous nine-nine split. Teams in both divisions will play fewer matches than in 2016 (14 instead of 16), meaning that teams in Division One will play all of their rivals twice.\nHampshire's opening fixture was away against Yorkshire at Headingley Cricket Ground, which they won by 4 wickets after successfully chasing 320. They will then play seven home matches in total at the Rose Bowl. One fixture, a home game against Somerset, will be a day–night match, part of an experiment by the England and Wales Cricket Board ahead of the staging of the first UK day–night test match in August.\nOther first-class matches.\nHampshire began the 2017 English cricket season with a three-day University match against Cardiff MCC University on 2 April. They will also play South Africa A in a day night match on 8 June.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nHampshire will play in the South group of the 2017 Royal London One-Day Cup. They will play each of the other eight teams in the group once.\nNatWest t20 Blast.\nHampshire will play in the South group of the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast. The county will play 14 matches, playing each team in the group at least once.\nQuarter-final.\nAs a result of Hampshire finishing in the top 4 of the South Group, they qualified for the quarter-finals. They will play Derbyshire on 22 August with the winner qualifying for Finals Day.\nFinals Day.\nAs a result of winning their quarter-final, Hampshire advanced to Finals Day to be held at Edgbaston on 2 September. After the 4th quarter-final it was confirmed that Hampshire had been drawn against Nottinghamshire in the second semi-final."

        "text": "Mark Walton (born March 29, 1997) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, and he was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL draft. He also played for the Miami Dolphins.\nEarly years.\nWalton attended Booker T. Washington High School in Miami, Florida. During his career, he rushed for 2,769 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Tornadoes. He committed to the University of Miami to play college football.\nCollege career.\nWalton played in all 13 games as a true freshman at Miami in 2015, rushing for 450 yards on 129 carries with 9 touchdowns. As a sophomore in 2016, he started all 13 games and rushed for 1,117 yards on 209 carries with 14 touchdowns. In 2017, as a junior, he rushed for 428 yards and three touchdowns on 56 carries in only four games due to ankle surgery which forced him to miss a majority of the season. On December 5, 2017, Walton declared his intentions to enter the 2018 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nWalton was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round (112th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. In the Bengals' Week 4 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he had his first five professional carries for nine rushing yards to go along with two receptions for 28 receiving yards. Overall, he finished his rookie season with 14 carries for 34 rushing yards to go along with five receptions for 41 receiving yards.\nOn April 6, 2019, Walton was waived by the Bengals after being arrested for the third time in the offseason.\nMiami Dolphins.\nAfter a mini-camp tryout, Walton signed with the Miami Dolphins on May 12, 2019. Walton made his first start against the Washington Redskins, rushing six times for 32 yards in a 16–17 Dolphins loss. He rushed for 66 yards on 14 carries the following week against the Buffalo Bills, also catching one reception for −8 yards. On November 4, he was suspended four games by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct and substance abuse policies for his offseason arrests. The Dolphins waived him on November 19, 2019, after his fourth arrest of the year. His suspension was lifted on December 3, 2019. Walton was suspended an additional eight weeks by the NFL on November 13, 2020, and reinstated on January 4, 2021.\nLegal issues.\nWalton was arrested three times during the 2019 off-season. He was first arrested and charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession on January 16, 2019, in North Miami-Dade. On February 15, 2019, he was arrested for a second time and charged with misdemeanor battery for an altercation triggered after he grabbed a phone from a neighbor in Miami. The charges underlying his third arrest on April 4, 2019, stemmed from a March 12, 2019, incident in which Walton fled on foot from his rented car after police tried to pull him over. Authorities found a rifle in the car and accused Walton of carrying a concealed firearm, resisting an officer without violence, possession of marijuana, and reckless driving. Walton pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor weapons charge from the March 2019 incident on August 19, 2019, and he received six months of probation and was required to turn in all of his firearms as well as undergo anger management and driving courses. The two marijuana possession charges and the battery charge were also dismissed.\nOn November 19, 2019, Walton was arrested in Davie, Florida, for allegedly attacking a woman who was five months pregnant with his child. Walton was charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. On January 3, 2020, he was charged with a second count of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman for a different incident with the same woman in March 2019. He was arrested on February 27, 2020, for violating a restraining order. On May 13, 2020, the aggravated battery charge against him from November 2019 was dropped.\nOn February 1, 2021, Walton was arrested in Miami for allegedly attempting to break a Pizza Hut window.\nOn March 24, 2022, Walton was arrested in Miami for an alleged armed robbery."

Three-time defending champion John F. Kennedy College was excluded from the tournament by an organizational rule change the previous month. The new rule prohibited a team from appearing in the WCWS if it gave scholarships to \"any\" women athletes, not just softball players (JFK College openly awarded women's basketball scholarships). JFK never returned to the WCWS, and the school closed just three years later.\nTeams.\nThe double elimination tournament included these teams:\nThe Arizona State Sun Devilettes defeated Tokyo–Nihon narrowly in the winners' bracket semi-final, 2–1, and split the tournament final, 0–1 and 8–5, with the if-necessary game requiring 11 innings.\nBracket.\nSource:"

        "text": "Valerie Robinson OBE ( Walsh; 18 December 1941 – 13 February 2022) was an England and Great Britain field hockey international, who played 149 international games and represented her country for more than 20 years.\nHockey.\nShe started to play hockey at the age of 14 for Accrington High School and became the first working class girl to be capped by England when she won her first cap in 1963. The highlight of her international career was winning a World Championship with England in 1975 in Edinburgh. She played in five world championships in total, and 19 Wembley internationals, and was the first Englishwoman to win 100 caps. She was, however, denied the opportunity to compete in the inaugural women's hockey event at the Olympics due to the British team's boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games. She believed that Britain could have won gold that year, although they failed to qualify for the Los Angeles Olympics four years later. \nHer ability to take on opponents set her apart, and her style was to body swerve and then go for goal. This technique often worked well, although her teammates were sometimes frustrated as she missed opportunities to pass to them when they were in better positions. She took many knocks, though withstood them and never missed an international game due to injury. \nShe later became a PE teacher and then in 1980 opened a residential hockey centre. She won two series of multi-sport TV competition Superstars - 1979 and 1981, and in 1985 she was named an officer of the Order of the British Empire for her contribution to her sport. She continued to play competitive hockey for Blackburn Northern into the late 1990s.\nFootball.\nRobinson also played football for Accrington Ladies, but the team folded in 1959 when she was 16 years old. She then became one of several players to join nearby Preston Ladies. Preston's manager Kath Latham recalled: \"Matt Busby came to see one of our matches at Blackpool. He sat in the stands and remarked to the people around him that Val was the best player he had ever seen in his life and if she had been a man, he would have signed her up there and then, to play for Manchester United!\" In the 1962 season Robinson was named Preston's joint-Player of the Year and Sheila Parker was Young Player of the Year. Robinson stopped playing football shortly afterwards, to focus on her hockey career.\nPersonal life and death.\nRobinson married Gwyn Robinson, a rugby-mad Welshman. They didn't have any children. She managed to maintain her athleticism despite smoking and drinking. Robinson died from cancer on 13 February 2022, at the age of 80."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Edward Horner",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Edward Horner stands inside St Andrew's Church in the village of Mells in Somerset, south-western England. It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, as a memorial to Edward Horner, who died of wounds in the First World War. The sculpture was executed by Sir Alfred Munnings.\nEdward Horner was the only surviving son and heir of Sir John and Lady Frances Horner of Mells Manor and a member of an extended upper-class social group known as the Coterie, many of whom were killed in the war. The group included Diana Manners who Edward pursued unsuccessfully for several years, his future brother-in-law - Raymond Asquith Julian Grenfell, Patrick Shaw-Stewart and Charles Lister. Shortly after the war broke out, he was a yeomanry officer in the part-time Territorial Force but he was keen to join the fighting on the Western Front and obtained a transfer to a cavalry regiment through his family's connections. He was wounded in May 1915, losing a kidney, and did not return to the war until early 1917. He was assigned a staff post but again secured a transfer to the front line. Shortly after his return to the fighting, on 21 November 1917, he was wounded again; he died the same day.\nLutyens was a friend of the Horner family, having designed multiple buildings and structures for them since the beginning of the 20th century. As well as Horner's memorial, he designed a memorial to Raymond Asquith (also in St Andrew's Church), and Mells War Memorial in the centre of the village. For Horner's memorial, Lutyens designed the plinth himself, and engaged the renowned equestrian painter and war artist Alfred Munnings for the latter's first public work of sculpture. The plinth is in Portland stone and set into it is Horner's original grave marker; the family's coat of arms is carved into the front, while the sides bear various dedicatory inscriptions. The statue is a bronze of a cavalry officer on horseback, bare-headed, with his helmet and sword on the horse's saddle. Lutyens was known for abstract and ecumenical themes in his war memorial designs, but the statue of Horner is an example of his use of more conventional imagery to commemorate an individual. Installed in the Horner family chapel in St Andrew's Church in 1920 at a cost of £1,000, it was moved to its present location in the church in 2007.\nBiography.\nEdward William Horner (born 3 May 1888) was the third child of Sir John Horner, KCVO, of Mells Manor, and his wife Frances (née Graham), and their first son. The family was reputed to be descendants of \"Little Jack Horner\", the subject of an 18th-century nursery rhyme. Sir John was a London barrister and later commissioner of woods, for which he was knighted in 1908. Frances was a prominent member of the Souls social group, whom she regularly hosted at Mells. \nEdward was the last direct male heir of the Horner family, his younger brother (Mark) having died of scarlet fever before the war. He was educated at Summer Fields School near Oxford, then at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a member of the Officers' Training Corps. At Oxford, he became part of the social network known as the Coterie. The group was made up largely of heirs to aristocratic families and included Raymond Asquith, Horner's future brother-in-law. Many of them were frequent visitors to Mells Manor at the beginning of the 20th century. Horner vigorously pursued Lady Diana Manners, a leading light of The Coterie, without much success. He struggled academically, graduating from Oxford with only a third-class degree, much to the disappointment of his parents and particularly his mother, who concentrated all her ambitions on Edward after Mark's premature death. Struggling for career options, Edward pursued his parents' ambition for him to become a barrister. He was called to the bar, and began a pupillage in 1914 in the chambers of Hugh Fraser under the ultimate guidance of F. E. Smith, one of the most distinguished barristers of the day.\nLike many contemporary men, especially those from aristocratic backgrounds, Horner felt a keen sense of patriotism fostered by his private education and by tales from imperial campaigns around the turn of the 20th century, especially the Second Boer War (1899–1902). On 19 August 1914, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the North Somerset Yeomanry, a part-time Territorial Force unit with no obligation to serve abroad. After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, his regiment was ordered to Hampshire for training. Unlike the men under his command, among them farmers who were reluctant to leave their land, Horner was keen to join the fighting in France. However, life in the North Somerset Yeomanry was not to Edward's liking. He wrote to his mother to complain that they had taken his two best hunters, and his man servant, and he was made to \"sleep on bare boards\" and rise at 5 a.m. As an influential aristocratic family, the Horners were able to secure him a transfer first to the Royal Horse Guards and then, in October 1914, to the 18th (Queen Mary's Own) Hussars. The 18th Hussars were stationed at Tidworth Camp in Wiltshire under the 11th Reserve Cavalry for training, after which they were deployed to the Western Front in early 1915.\nHorner arrived first at Rouen, well behind the front, and then in February 1915 was ordered forward to Hazebrouck on the Belgian border. In May 1915, he was assigned to escort a working party to dig trenches on the north side of the Yser Canal. During the march, he was wounded in the abdomen by shrapnel from an artillery shell. Hospitalised at the No. 7 General Hospital at Boulogne in France, he had a kidney removed, and at one point his condition was so grave that his parents were given special permission to visit him. They were accompanied by Diana Manners and a private doctor and nurse. He left the hospital on 1 June and was allowed to return to Mells to recuperate for the summer of 1915. Eager to return to the front, Horner went before a medical board in December 1915 but was told that his missing kidney rendered him ineligible for front-line duties. He was sent again to Tidworth to await orders, which arrived in January 1916, instructing him to sail for Egypt. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant in November 1916.\nHe was first assigned a staff post in Egypt but was again able to transfer to a fighting role in France in February 1917. In October that year, the family's second home at Mells Park was destroyed by fire; Horner was given compassionate leave in early November and returned to the village to visit his parents. Returning to France, he was given command of a troop (16 soldiers and horses). The 18th Hussars were part of the Battle of Cambrai, where they were holding the village of Noyelles, south-east of Cambrai itself. He was hit in the groin on 21 November 1917 and evacuated to No. 48 Casualty Clearing Station near Ytres but died that evening. He is buried in Rocquigny-Equancourt Road British Cemetery, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The headstone for his grave in France contains the epitaph \"Small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of England\", from Shakespeare's \"Henry V\".\nCommissioning.\nSir Edwin Lutyens was among the most distinguished architects in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for The Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.\nAlfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Munnings produced two models in clay for review by Lady Horner; he worked from photographs provided by Lady Horner and a live model in producing the statue. At one point, Munnings was so dissatisfied with the statue's head that he cut it off and re-cast it from scratch.\nDesign and history.\nThe memorial stands inside St Andrew's Church in Mells. The Horner family had a long association with the church, which shares a wall with the manor house. The family has its own chapel (formerly the Lady Chapel) in the church which contains the tombs of several family members. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Horners funded extensive restoration work to the building. The memorial is a bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Munnings, featuring Edward Horner as a young cavalry officer, bare-headed and seated on horseback with his sword and helmet attached to the saddle. The statue originally faced a stained-glass window featuring a Madonna and Child, creating the image of Horner riding towards the light. It stands on a Portland stone plinth designed by Lutyens, reminiscent of his Cenotaph and described by Lutyens' biographer Jane Ridley as \"deceptively simple\". The temporary memorial cross, which originally marked Horner's grave in France, inscribed , is set into the rear of the plinth while the Horner family's coat of arms is moulded into the front. The south (left) side bears the inscription , while the north (right) side reads , from Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Adonaïs\" (1821), an elegy for John Keats.\nAccording to Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' work in the 1980s, \"some of [Lutyens'] finest memorials and tombs\" are to be found in Mells, and Edward Horner's memorial is one of \"Lutyens' best and most moving tributes to the waste of life in the Great War\". In his public war memorials (particularly the Cenotaph and the various memorials based on it), Lutyens often used abstract and ecumenical designs, feeling that a different form of architecture was needed to convey the sense of sorrow at the enormous loss of life. Where he was commissioned to commemorate an individual, however, Lutyens was more open to conventional imagery, such as a statue of an officer. According to Tim Skelton, author of \"Lutyens and the Great War\" (2008), the Horner statue is \"widely considered to be one of the most moving of personal memorials to the [First World War]\". Lutyens' original design for Horner's memorial included pillars rising from the plinth to enclose the statue in a mausoleum, but this part of the proposal was not implemented. Munnings' mould for the statue is on display at the Munnings Art Museum, in his former home and studio in Dedham in Essex.\nThe statue was installed in 1920. It cost over £1,000 and was by far the largest and most elaborate of the several war-related monuments in Mells. Frances Horner initially hoped for it to stand underneath the church's bell tower, but the suggestion prompted objections from villagers and the churchwardens, who were hesitant about having it in the church at all. Thus it was placed in the Horner chapel, on the north side of the chancel. In 2007 it was moved to the west end of the north aisle, as the church trustees wished to create space to allow more flexible use of the church."

The player(s) are given the option of a variety of clubs and golf courses, as well as three skill levels.\nReception.\n\"Sega Master Force\" magazine expressed reservations about the game's complex parameters and placed particular criticism upon the simplistic audio, commenting that \"the graphics and sound are a little disappointing\" and that \"the course is just one big mass of greenery with the occasional sand pit\". Praise was, however, given to the realism and depth of gameplay, along with a comment that it was one of the best sports titles available on the Master System."

The school's team currently competes in the Big West Conference, which they have played in since 1996, two years after joining Division I. The team plays its home games in Mott Athletics Center.\nHistory.\nCal Poly began playing women's basketball at the intercollegiate level in 1974 in the AIAW, with NCAA-sponsored play beginning in 1981.\nThe Mustangs have had three teams tie for the school record for wins (21) in a season: the 1981–82 squad coached by Marilyn McNeil and the 2008–09 and 2012–13 squads coached by Faith Mimnaugh.\nFollowing Sharon Chatman (1974–75) and Mary Stallard (1975–79), McNeil coached Cal Poly from 1979 to 1986 before becoming an athletics administrator on campus. In 1994, McNeil departed Cal Poly to become the athletic director at Monmouth University, from which she retired in 2021. Taking over after Jill Orrock (1986–95) and Karen Booker (1995–97), Mimnaugh served as head coach from 1997 to 2022. Shanele Stires, former WNBA player and head coach at Cal State East Bay, was hired as the team's seventh head coach on April 14, 2022.\nThe furthest the team has advanced came in March 2013, when Cal Poly defeated Pacific 63–49 to win the Big West Conference women's basketball tournament, their first conference tournament championship after two previous years of regular-season titles. Seeded 14th in their ensuing NCAA Tournament appearance, they lost 85-55 to Penn State in the first round. Cal Poly qualified for the semifinal round of the Big West Tournament in March 2020, but the postseason was abruptly canceled due to COVID-19 after the Mustangs had won comfortably twice in the tournament's earlier rounds.\nThe team has made four WNIT appearances, losing to California (Berkeley) in 2011, Washington in 2012, San Diego in 2014, and Pacific in 2024."

        "text": "The UC Irvine Anteaters women's basketball team is the basketball team that represents the University of California, Irvine. The team currently competes in the Big West Conference, NCAA Division I.\nHistory.\nSince beginning play in 1974, UC Irvine has (as of the end of the 2020-2021 season) an all-time record of 517–793. The Anteaters have won the conference tournament twice (in 1995 &amp; 2024), with five losses in the tournament championship game (1984, 1985, 1997, 2021, 2022) UC Irvine hired Tamara Inoue as their new head coach for the 2016-2017 season. Inoue came to UC Irvine from New Mexico State where she was an integral member of the women's basketball staff from 2011-16. She spent her last two seasons as an associate head coach and also served as the interim Senior Woman Administrator in 2015-16. After taking over a team that won a total of 12 games at Irvine in the two seasons prior to her arrival, Inoue brought a renewed energy and mindset that paid off immediately. In 2017-18, just her second year as head coach and first with her own recruits, Inoue led the Anteaters to an 18-14 overall record and their first national postseason appearance since 1995. The 18 victories more than doubled their win total from each of the previous three campaigns. The ‘Eaters also saw a 12.5 game improvement from 2016–17, tying for the second-best turnaround in all of NCAA Division I. UCI, which was picked eighth in the Big West Preseason Poll, placed third in the regular-season standings at 10-6, marking its best conference finish since 2011-12. The Anteaters ended the year ranked first in the league and 13th in the nation with 11.1 steals per outing. They also established UC Irvine’s highest single-game scoring total in the NCAA Division I Championship era, and tied an overall school record, with 107 points vs. Cal Poly. Inoue’s group set the tone for the record-breaking campaign with a dramatic season-opening victory over Utah State. They erased a 13-point deficit over the final four minutes and capped the rally by sinking a half-court shot at the buzzer for an 87-84 win. The game-winning play was featured at No. 1 on SportsCenter's Top-10 that evening. Inoue saw two of her student-athletes earn All-Big West accolades, highlighted by Jordan Sanders, who became just the second player in UCI history to be named the Big West Freshman of the Year. In 2018-19, Inoue guided the Anteaters to the third 20-win campaign in program history and the first since 1984-85. They had their best start ever at 7-0 with the seven consecutive victories tying UC Irvine’s third-longest win streak. Their success did not go unnoticed as the ‘Eaters made their debut in the College Insider Mid-Major Poll and rose to as high as No. 15 in the nation. UCI went on to make its first appearance in the Big West Tournament semifinals in five years. As a team, the Anteaters finished among the top-25 in the nation in turnover margin (7th), turnovers forced (22nd), and steals (23rd). Individually, Andee Ritter broke the all-time school record in 3-pointers made and steals. She graduated as UC Irvine’s single-game (8), single-season (87), and career (202) leader in threes made. Jordan Sanders was named to the All-Big West First Team after ranking second in the conference and 23rd in the country with 20.3 points per game. In 2019-2020, the ‘Eaters tied for second in the Big West regular-season standings, which was their best conference finish in Inoue’s tenure. At 9-7, it was the third-straight year they were at or above .500 in league play. Lauren Saiki established a single-season school record with 215 assists and earned first-team All-Big West honors. Sophia Locandro also garnered honorable mention and All-Freshman Team recognition.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament appearances.\nUC Irvine has appeared in the NCAA Tournament once, having a record of 0–1.\nWNIT appearances.\nUC Irvine have appeared in two WNIT Tournaments. Their record is 1–2. \nWBI appearances.\nUC Irvine have appeared in one WBI Tournaments. Their record is 0–1. "

        "text": "The UC Davis Aggies Women's Basketball team represent the University of California, Davis in Davis, California, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Big West Conference.\nHistory.\nAfter taking part in an NCAA Division II program, the UC Davis women's basketball team transitioned to the NCAA Division I level in 2003–04, officially competing as a member of the Big West Conference in 2007–08.\nEntering the 2020–21 season, the Aggies have won five Big West Conference regular season titles (2009–10, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20) and two Big West Tournament titles (2011, 2019) in their combined 13 Division I seasons. UC Davis is one of the three schools in league history to win at least four consecutive Big West regular season titles, joining UC Santa Barbara (1996–2005) and Long Beach State (1985–1989).\nThe Aggies have twice advanced to the NCAA Tournament (2011, 2019) as the automatic qualifier out of the Big West Conference. They have earned five berths to the WNIT, including an \"Elite Eight\" appearance in 2018 and a \"Sweet 16\" appearance in 2017.\n, UC Davis has posted a 248–160 (.608) overall record as a Division I program, including a 135–69 (.662) record in Big West Conference play.\nCoaches.\nSource\n\"All coaching records as of the 2022–23 season.\"\nHead coach Pam Gill–Fisher was a student-athlete (basketball, softball, volleyball, tennis, and field hockey), coach, and administrator, at UC Davis. She was inducted into the Cal Aggie Athletics Hall of Fame twice, once as a student-athlete in 1984 and once as a coach and administrator in 2012. She led UC Davis women's basketball to a total of 164 wins over 12 seasons, earning Northern California Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honours in 1986. She also served as head coach for the Aggies' women's volleyball and tennis teams, including an NCAA Division II national title in tennis in 1990.\nJorja Hoehn ranks second in wins with 205 victories in nine seasons, won the WBCA 1995 Division II National Coach of the Year, and Northern California Athletic Conference Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1996. The Aggies reached the NCAA Division II West Regional Final six times and reached the NCAA Tournament in eight of her nine campaigns. She was inducted into the Cal Aggie Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.\nSandy Simpson coached the team for 14 seasons and holds the school record for coaching victories with 251. He played for the Aggie men's team and was an assistant for the women's program before becoming the interim head coach for the 1996–97 where he was named the Northern California Athletic Conference Coach of the Year in 1997. He was the interim coach again in 1998–99, earning the California Collegiate Athletic Association Coach of the Year, and was named the permanent head coach in 1999. He was the coach during the transition to Division I and earned the Big West Conference Coach of the Year in 2008 and 2010. In 2008, he led UC Davis to a second-place finish in the standings and advanced to the Big West Tournament championship game, becoming only the second team in league history to reach the championship game and earn a postseason berth in its first year in the conference. In his final season, led fourth-seeded UC Davis to the Big West Tournament Championship over top-seeded Cal Poly in 2011 and the program's first berth in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament\nJennifer Gross served as an assistant and associate head coach under Sandy Simpson from 2004 until he retired in 2011. She has since won the Big West Conference Coach of the Year in four consecutive seasons from 2017 to 2020 and was a finalist for the WBCA 2018 National Coach of the Year Award. She was inducted into the Cal Aggie Athletics Hall of Fame in 2003 as a student-athlete for her four seasons with the Aggies from 1993 to 1997, setting school records for career assists (448), steals (300), and three-pointers made (163).\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nUC Davis has advanced to the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament three times, all as an automatic qualifier from the Big West Conference. The Aggies are 0–3 in NCAA Tournament play.\nWomen's National Invitation Tournament results.\nUC Davis has made five appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). The Aggies are 5–5 all-time in the WNIT, including an \"Elite Eight\" appearance in 2018 and a \"Sweet 16\" appearance in 2017. The wins over Utah and Colorado State in 2017 were the program's first postseason wins as a Division I program. The five WNIT victories overall are the most of any Big West Conference school as of 2019–20, while the \"Elite Eight\" berth in 2018 marked the furthest that any Big West Conference school had advanced in that tournament under its current format that began in 1998.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nUC Davis made 12 appearances in the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament with a 12–12 record. The Aggies advanced to the \"Elite Eight\" of the 1997 NCAA Division II Tournament, reaching the semifinals before falling to Southern Indiana, 70–62, and finishing third nationally with a 76–61 win over Bentley in the third-place game.\nAIAW Division III tournament results.\nThe Aggies made one appearance in the AIAW National Division III basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1."

It is one of the most successful men's team in Icelandic basketball, winning 17 national championships. The team, then known as Íþróttafélag Keflavíkurflugvallar (ÍKF), was one of the founding members of the Icelandic top league in 1952 and won the first Icelandic men's championship that same year.

In late 1973 the basketball department was in need of new uniforms and due to lack of funds they decided to select a colour that no other team was using, so they wouldn't have to buy two sets of uniforms. There were three colours to choose from but as the three selectors were all Boston Celtics fans they decided to choose green uniforms.

He formerly played with the Buffalo Sabres and Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nAfter a successful career at Nichols School, where he was All-State in three sports, Malone was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the sixth round, 159th overall, in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He played college hockey for Harvard University of ECAC Hockey. During his junior and senior years at Harvard, he underwent hip surgery and rehabilitation for his injury. Despite his setbacks, he was signed to a professional contract by the Sabres on April 8, 2017, and made his NHL debut that night in a game against the Florida Panthers as an emergency replacement for Marcus Foligno. He had one shot on net and played over 12 minutes in the 3–0 loss to the Panthers.\nAfter participating in the Buffalo Sabres development camp in July 2017, Malone was unable to participate at the Sabres' rookie camp, the Prospects Challenge tournament, and training camp due to another injury. He was then assigned to the Sabres AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans, for the 2017–18 season.\nOn June 25, 2019, Malone opted to remain within the Sabres organization, signing a one-year AHL contract to continue with the Rochester Americans. In the 2019–20 season, Malone in his third season with the Americans appeared in 58 games, placing second on the team in scoring by tallying 30 points, before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a free agent, Malone was able to secure an NHL contract by agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract with the Nashville Predators on July 15, 2020. Malone opened the pandemic delayed season with the Predators, registering an assist in his lone game with the club. He later re-assigned to AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, for the remainder of the year.\nAs a free agent from the Predators, Malone opted to return to his original club, the Buffalo Sabres, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract on July 28, 2021.\nOn August 2, 2023, having left the Sabres at the conclusion of his contract, Malone opted to pursue a European career by signing a two-year contract with Swiss club, SCL Tigers of the NL.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a left fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a fly out), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. The left fielder (LF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders have to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The left fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of left field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder closest to third base, the left fielder generally does not have to throw as far as the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often do not have the strongest throwing arm, but their throws need to be accurate. The left fielder normally plays behind the third baseman and shortstop, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, left fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number 7.\nThe overwhelming majority of putouts recorded by left fielders, almost to exclusivity, result from catching fly balls. However, in extraordinary circumstances, an outfielder may record a putout by receiving a throw to force out or tag out a runner while covering a base if one or more infielders are out of position to retrieve an errant throw, or by tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play; however, even in such circumstances, outfielders will more typically act as a backup to infielders than cover a base themselves. Historically, putout totals for outfielders rose after 1920 with the end of the dead-ball era; the same circumstances which had kept home run totals low, such as overused baseballs and legal adulterations including the spitball, had similarly hindered the type of power hitting which lent itself to long fly balls. But as strikeout totals have risen in baseball in recent decades, the frequency of other defensive outs including flyouts has declined; as a result, putout totals for outfielders have likewise declined. Through the 2022 season, 17 of the top 20 single-season left field putout totals were recorded between 1920 and 1992; none of the top 39 have been recorded since 1997.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate putout totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Because they are expected to cover more territory in the outfield than their counterparts on either side, often being the fastest player of the three, center fielders typically record the highest putout totals; left fielders usually record slightly more putouts than right fielders due to the ball being more frequently hit to the left side of the field. Barry Bonds is the all-time leader in career putouts as a left fielder with 5,226. Rickey Henderson (5,215) is second all-time, and the only other player with over 5,000 career putouts as a left fielder.\nAs of November 2023, no active players are in the top 100 for career putouts as a left fielder. The active leader is current free agent David Peralta in 106th with 1,511."

Unprecedented bad weather during the event led to 6 boats retiring from the race.\nBad weather.\nThe late-November start date was chosen as officially Atlantic hurricane seasons end on November 30; however, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active and lasted for an unusually long time, having tropical storms forming after the official end date.\nA majority of the crews had completed between a quarter and a third of the race when there was a prolonged spell of unfavorable growing conditions. Rather than the typical trade winds, that would have been helping the fleet, there were strong westerly winds caused mainly by Hurricane Epsilon. These forced many of the crews to stop rowing completely and to deploy a sea anchor to prevent them from drifting backward.\nIn early January many of the fleets ended up passing through the southern edge of Tropical Storm Zeta, which raised high seas and created more adverse wind conditions.

They had managed a fast start and were able to get clear of much of the bad weather that dogged other crews. Their lead had stretched to several hundred nautical miles before the other crews were able to start moving again. \"All Relative\" crossed the finish line in Antigua at 15:37:47 UTC on 8 January 2006; a crossing time of 39 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes, and 47 seconds which broke the race record by just over 22 hours but fell 3 days outside the World Record. The crew also included the youngest ever person to complete the row across the Atlantic, 19 when the race began, and 20 on 7 January 2006.\nSecond to finish was the four-man boat \"Atlantic-4\", crewed by David Martin, Neil Wightwick, Glynn Coupland, and George Simpson, who crossed the finish line at 02:26 UTC on 19 January 2006, a crossing time of 49 days, 14 hours, 21 minutes.\nThe third boat to finish was \"Spirit of EDF Energy\", crewed by double Olympic champion oarsman James Cracknell OBE and Ben Fogle, a UK TV presenter. They crossed the finish at 07:13 UTC on 19 January 2006, a crossing time of 49 days, 19 hours, and 8 minutes. They were eventually placed second in the doubles division due to a time penalty, issued for using their emergency water ration. A BBC television program on their experience, \"Through Hell and High Water\", was aired in February 2006.\nThe fourth boat to finish, and winner of the Doubles division, was \"C2\", crewed by Britons Chris Andrews and Clint Evans, who crossed the line at 14:15 UTC on 20 January 2006, a crossing time of 51 days, 2 hours, 10 minutes. \"C2\" were the first crew to finish the race without incurring any penalty and therefore declared overall race winners.\nIn fifth place overall, and third, in the doubles division, was the crew \"Boat de Vie\". They were the first non-United Kingdom residents to finish the race, both crew members being residents of France. Both rowers were also leg-amputees and competed on equal terms with everyone else. They crossed the finish line at 15:36 UTC on 23 January 2006, a time of 54 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes.\nIn sixth place overall, and fourth in the doubles division, was the crew of \"Atlantic Prince\". They finished at 00:21 UTC on 28 January 2006, a time of 58 days, 12 hours, and 16 minutes. Their boat had the distinction that this was its fourth successful Atlantic crossing. The two crew were also former captains of First and Third Trinity Boat Club who had broken the world record for a \"two-man 1,000,000-metres on a rowing machine\" by about 4.5 hours only a couple of weeks before the race.\nIn seventh place overall, and fifth in the doubles division, was the crew \"Team Scandines\" crewed by Søren Sprogøe and Christian Petersen. They were the second crew of non-UK residents to finish, both crew members being from Denmark. They crossed the finish line at 21:11 UTC on 28 January 2006 – a time of 59 days, 19 hours, and 6 minutes.\nIn eighth place overall, and sixth in the doubles division, was \"Row4Cancer\" crewed by Liz O'Keeffe and Richard Mayon-White. They were the first mixed crew to finish and Liz was the first woman to reach Antigua, over a week ahead of the next woman. They crossed the finish line at 07:01 UTC on 30 January 2006 – a time of 60 days, 18 hours, 56 minutes. They had also suffered four complete capsize during the race and lost much of their kit.\nMission Atlantic, crewed by four women from Guernsey ( Kathy Tracey, Sarah Day, Paula Evemy, and Lois Rawlins-Deguelin) finished the race in 67 days, 7 hours, and 20 minutes and they became the first Women's Fours ever to cross an ocean – any ocean – and therefore held the world record for the fastest Ladies Fours across the Atlantic. They also were the only fours boat to complete the race without using any of their emergency water ballast.\nThe first solo to cross the finish line was Chris Martin in the boat \"Pacific Pete\". He crossed the finish at 03:24 UTC on 7 February 2006 – a crossing time of 68 days, 15 hours, 19 minutes. Martin had rowed for Great Britain in six consecutive World Championships – at junior, under 23, and senior levels.\nAdjusted Final Positions.\nThe final positions were adjusted from the Line Honours due to the ballast rule, which penalizes the use of emergency drinking water as it makes the boat lighter and therefore faster. Due to the bad weather, four boats were forced to use this supply. The positions were not adjusted until the last boat had finished, leading to accusations of favoritism for the celebrities and some confusion as to who had \"won\"; as the penalties were applied per finishing order across all classes.\nRetiring crews.\nSix crews retired from the race:"

        "text": "The 2007 race left San Sebastián de la Gomera on Sunday 2 December 2007 with the finish in English Harbour, Antigua, on the same course as the 2005 race. 2 singles, 15 pairs and 5 fours started the race, with a six-crew boat starting slightly later. One pair \"Titanic Challenge\" and one Four \"Move Ahead II\" retired early on.\nLine Honours.\nThe first to finish, \"Pura Vida\", was a four crewed by John Cecil-Wright, Robbie Grant, Tom Harvey &amp; Carl Theakston (all GB) finished at 14.52 UTC on 19 January 2008, taking 48 Days, 2 hours, 52 minutes.\nThe first pair, \"Gquma Challenger\" (Gquma meaning\"breaking wave\"), was crewed by South Africans Bill Godfrey &amp; Peter Van Kets. They finished at 00.15 UTC on 22 January, with the second pair, \"No Fear\", crewed by John Csehi &amp; Nick Histon (both GB) finishing just 5 hours and 50 minutes later, after over 50 days at sea.\nThe next to finish, \"Unfinished Business\", comprised four women—Jo Davies (GB), Sarah Kessans (US), Emily Kohl (US) &amp; Tara Remington (NZ)—who had all competed in the 2005 race but had failed to finish due to injury, capsizing or sinking. They finished on 23 January in a time of 51 days, 16 hours and 31 minutes, a new female-fours record for an Atlantic crossing. The women then renamed the boat \"Finished Business\".\nFifth to finish, \"Go Commando\", was crewed by Ben Gaffney and Orlando Rogers (both GB). They finished in 54 days, 8 hours and 39 minutes. Their row, and the preparation for it, were the subject of a 1-hour TV documentary shown on ITV4 (UK) on 7 March 2008. Go Commando made a last minute dash and pulled away from \"The Reason Why\" crewed by Steve Gardner &amp; Paul Harris (both GB), who finished 3 hours 24 minutes later, the sixth to finish.\nHaving started much later, \"Oyster Shack Ocean Challenger\" came in next. This was a \"six\" boat, although it was eventually rowed by five. Although \"Oyster Shack\" accompanied the race, it was a record attempt and not a race entrant and so was not placed (see below).\nThe seventh to finish, \"Pendovey Swift\" crewed by Ian Andrews and Joss Elliott (both GB), finished in 62 days, 20 hours and 56 Minutes. Next was \"Mission Atlantic\", a four comprising Andy Ehrhart, Justin Ellis, Mark Hefford and Nick Young (all GB) who completed the crossing in 65 days, 0 hours and 28 minutes although they were later disqualified (See \"Race Positions\" below). In eighth place came \"Komale\" with James Burge &amp; Niall McCann (both GB) who took the start line, but immediately returned to San Sebastian due to a medical problem. They eventually started 2 days late and had a crossing time of 63 days, 2 hours and 5 minutes, but a race time 2 days longer than this.\n\"Jaydubyoo\", crewed by brothers Andrew and Joseph Jordon-White (both GB), came ninth in 65 days, 19 hours 43 minutes—narrowly beating \"Row of Life\", crewed by Angela Madsen (USA) &amp; Franck Festor (France), who finished in 65 days, 23 hours 24 minutes. Angela, a paraplegic, and Franck, a leg amputee, had originally planned to row the Atlantic in a differently-abled four, \"Differents?\" in 2006 but, when this was cancelled, agreed to row as a pair in order to \"inspire, motivate and effect positive changes in the lives of those who are born differently abled and those who suffer serious trauma in their lives.\" \"Differents?\" made its first Atlantic crossing in 1997 and competed in the 2005 race as \"Bout de Vie\".\nEleventh was \"Ocean Summit\", crewed by Neil Hunter &amp; Scott McNaughton (both GB), in 66 days, 10 hours and 10 minutes. Twelfth was \"Pygram\" with Fabien Decourt and Benoit Dusser (both France) in 72 Days, 3 hours and 3 minutes. \"Atlantic Jack\", crewed by Catherine Allaway (GB) &amp; Margaret Bowling (Australia) came in only 2 hours 11 minutes later, although they were disqualified from the race (See \"Race Positions\" below). \"C2\", crewed by Andy Watson (GB) and Ian McGlade (Ireland), also finished the same day in 73 days 10 hours and 45 minutes, but were relegated 2 places for using emergency drinking water.\n\"Silver Cloud\", crewed by Clair Desborough, Sarah Duff, Rachel Flanders &amp; Fiona Waller (all GB), finished in 74 Days 1 hour and 3 minutes, putting them thirteenth in the race and making 17-year-old Rachel Flanders the youngest person to have rowed an ocean.\nThe two Solos both came in on 16 February, \"1 Charmed Life\" rowed by Peter Collett (GB/Australia) finished in 75 Days, 23 hours, 46 minutes in 14th place, and the \"Spirit of Fernie\" rowed by Paul Attalla (Canada) in 76 Days 7 Hours and 46 minutes was placed 16th by the demoting of C2.\n\"Barbara Ivy\", crewed by Linda Griesel &amp; Rachel Smith (both GB) finished 17th in 76 days 7 hours and 46 minutes and the final finisher was \"Dream Maker\" with Elin Haf Davies &amp; Herdip Sidhu (both GB) in 77 days, 7 hours, 37 minutes\nRace Positions.\nMost finishing positions were unaltered, \"C2\" was relegated 2 places, from thirteenth to fifteenth, for using over 110 litres of their emergency drinking water\nTwo boats which completed the crossing were disqualified from the race for receiving assistance en route. These were \"Mission Atlantic\", who were supplied with food, and \"Atlantic Jack\", who received food and a rudder-pin.\nOyster Shack.\n\"Oyster Shack Ocean Challenger\" was attempting to beat the record for the fastest rowed Atlantic crossing of 35 days 8 Hours and 30 minutes, set in 1992 by \"La Mondiale\" with a French crew of 11. The same \"La Mondiale\", this time with a British &amp; Irish crew of fourteen, and an American rowed tri-maran \"Orca\", with a crew of four, set out from Puerto de Mogán, Gran Canaria, for Port St. Charles, Barbados, at about the same time—both trying to beat the record.\n\"Oyster Shack\" had a late crew change and delayed their start until 5 December 2007, 2 days after the race started, hoping for better weather. Unfortunately the new crew member, Andy Morris, injured his knee and the attempt was abandoned after 22 hours with the boat towed to El Hierro. Having returned to La Gomera by ferry the boat was repaired and the five remaining crew members: Simon Chalk, Ian Couch, George Oliver, Mike Martin &amp; Ben Thackwray (all GB) decided to try without a replacement.\nHaving waited for favourable weather again the second attempt left on 23 December 2007. Initially they had good weather and made good time, however, the rudder sheared off, the weather deteriorated and the repaired rudder broke again. They finally arrived in 37 days 5 hours and 39 minutes failing to beat the record. In the meantime \"La Mondiale\" had beaten the record with a time of 33 Days 7 hours and 30 minutes. This was the first crossing by a crew of five and the also the world record for fastest time from Canaries to Antigua in a row boat; as the four faster Atlantic crossings have all been to Barbados (which is subject to more favourable mid Atlantic currents)."

Ceylon did not then have Test status, but three five-day unofficial Tests were played, Pakistan winning all three by large margins in only four days. The tour also included two other first-class matches before the unofficial Tests.\nThe Ceylon team.\nAll 14 players appeared in the three-match series against Pakistan. Pakistan, captained by Hanif Mohammad, also used 14 players. Only five of the Ceylon team – Tissera, Chanmugam, Herbert Fernando, Fredrick and Jayasinghe – had toured India in 1964–65, Ceylon's previous major tour.\nThe tour.\nAfter a drawn two-day match in Bahawalpur, the Ceylon team drew a first-class match against a President's XI in Rawalpindi. Inman was the highest scorer, with 87 in 90 minutes in the first innings, and Wimalaratne and Thomas were the chief wicket-takers. Next came a first-class match in Lyallpur against a Punjab Governor's XI, which was also drawn. Inman scored 102 in 127 minutes in the first innings, and Chanmugam and Thomas were the chief wicket-takers.\nIn the first unofficial Test, at Lahore Stadium, Pakistan scored 425 (Mushtaq Mohammad 101), Crozier taking 6 for 135 and Chanmugam 3 for 54. Ceylon were then dismissed for 189 (Intikhab Alam 5 for 70; Wimalaratne, at number 11, was the highest scorer with 41 not out) and, following on, 275 (Jayasinghe 118; Intikhab Alam 4 for 85). Pakistan scored 40 without loss to win by 10 wickets.\nThe second match, at Dacca Stadium, was even more one-sided, Pakistan declaring and winning by an innings and 37 runs. Pakistan scored 517 for 7 declared (Mushtaq Mohammad 129, Hanif Mohammad 114; Thomas took the first three wickets and finished with 3 for 166). Ceylon made 213 and 267. Crozier's 57 in the second innings was the only fifty; Saeed Ahmed took 5 for 48 and 5 for 82.\nThe third match, at the National Stadium, Karachi, was another innings victory for Pakistan. Ceylon were dismissed for 178 (Saleem Altaf 4 for 56), Pakistan replied with 483 (Javed Burki 210; Crozier 7 for 133) and Ceylon made 270 in their second innings (Tissera 120 not out; Intikhab Alam 4 for 55), giving Pakistan victory by an innings and 35 runs.\nIn the series, Pakistan scored 1466 runs for 27 wickets at an average of 54.29; Ceylon scored 1392 for 60 wickets, average 23.20.\nThe tour, which had been intended to prepare the Ceylon players for the planned tour of England in 1968, was a disappointment. \"Wisden\"'s report put Ceylon's failure down to their inexperience in longer matches: \"Ceylon, whose cricket is normally confined to one and a half day games, showed their inability in four-day cricket, always forcing the pace, trying to make the game bright and entertaining, and as a result they lacked the staying power and temperament which are so vital in big cricket.\" Some of the Ceylon players thought the Pakistan umpires were biased against them.\nLeading players.\nIn the three matches against Pakistan, Crozier was Ceylon's outstanding player, taking 14 wickets (out of the 27 wickets Pakistan lost in total) at an average of 26.57, and making 142 runs at an average of 23.66. Jayasinghe and Tissera each scored a century, but otherwise failed to reach 30; Ceylon's only other fifty was Crozier's in the second match. Inman, after good form in the preliminary matches, scored only 110 runs at an average of 18.33."

        "text": "United 2026, also known as the North American 2026 bid, was a successful joint bid led by the United States Soccer Federation, together with the Canadian Soccer Association and the Mexican Football Federation, to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nWhile the soccer federations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States had individually announced plans to field a bid for the 2026 World Cup, the concept of a joint bid among the three North American countries was first proposed in 2016. The joint bid was officially unveiled on April 10, 2017, under which the tournament would be held at venues in all three countries. A shortlist of 23 candidate cities were named in the official bid, with 17 in the U.S., 3 in Canada, and 3 in Mexico. Ten U.S. candidate cities will join three Canadian candidate cities, and three Mexican candidate cities, to form the roster of 16 cities that will host the matches of this World Cup. Although a joint bid, the majority of the matches will be held in the United States. Canada and Mexico will host 10 matches each, while the United States will host the other 60, including all matches from the quarterfinals onward.\nOn June 13, 2018, at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, Russia, the United bid was selected by 134 votes to Morocco's 65. Upon this selection, Canada will become the fifth country to host both the men's and women's World Cup, joining Sweden, the United States, Germany, and France. Mexico will become the first country to host three men's World Cups, and the United States will become the first country to host both the men's and women's World Cup twice each. This will be the first World Cup to be hosted in three countries, as well as the first since 2002 and the second overall to be held in multiple countries.\nBackground.\nThe three soccer federations of Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. announced interest in submitting a bid for the 2026 World Cup years before the federations intended to unify their efforts.\nIn July 2012, Canadian Soccer Association president Victor Montagliani confirmed plans for a Canadian bid, saying: \"We have verbally told FIFA that when the bid process begins for the next available World Cup, which would be the 2026 World Cup, that the CSA will be one of the countries putting in a formal proposal\". At the time the bid was announced, Canada had hosted the men's 1987 Under-16 World Championship and the U-20 World Cups for both men and women; the country has since hosted the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015. In October 2013, Montagliani confirmed Canada's intention to bid for the 2026 tournament and the Canadian Soccer Association reiterated this in January 2014.\nIn September 2012, Mexican Football Federation (FMF) President Justino Compeán confirmed plans for a Mexican bid. In October 2013, Liga MX President said that Mexico was interested in joining forces with the U.S. to co-host a bid for the 2026 World Cup. On December 9, 2014, FMF confirmed that it was bidding for the 2026 World Cup.\nOn May 13, 2016, at the FIFA Congress in Mexico City, USSF board member John Motta told ESPN \"whatever happens, we will bid for the 2026 World Cup -- either jointly (with Mexico or Canada) or we will go it alone.\" The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and unsuccessfully bid for the 2022 World Cup, which was won by Qatar in 2010. On April 18, 2015, Brazilian legend Pelé stated that the United States should host the 2026 World Cup.\nIn December 2016 Victor Montagliani, CONCACAF president announced for the first time a possibility of a joint bid between the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the 2026 World Cup.\nOn April 10, 2017, the three bodies officially announced their intent to submit a joint bid for the 2026 World Cup.\nBid process.\nBidding for the 2026 FIFA World Cup was postponed due to the 2015 FIFA corruption case and the subsequent resignation of Sepp Blatter, then was restarted following the FIFA Council meeting on May 10, 2016, wherein the bidding process would consist of four phases:\nWith no rival bid having emerged since April 2017 the CONCACAF member federations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States sent a joint request to FIFA to hasten the bid process. Canada, Mexico, and the United States wanted FIFA to award the bid outside the traditional bidding process at the June 2018 FIFA Congress in Moscow if the CONCACAF-bid meets FIFA requirements.\nHowever the FIFA Council decided on May 8, 2017, that FIFA would have a full bidding procedure. In order to ensure continental rotation of hosting duties, only the member associations of CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, and the OFC were invited, as these continental confederations had not hosted the two previous World Cups. A date of August 11, 2017, was set for submission of an intention to bid.\nFIFA football tournament hosting experiences.\nTogether, Canada, Mexico, and the United States have hosted 13 FIFA events, which is the most of any trio of geographically connected nations.\nIn addition, all three countries have hosted at least one Olympic football tournament. Canada played host in Montreal 1976, Mexico in Mexico City 1968, and the United States hosted twice – in Los Angeles 1984 and Atlanta 1996. The Atlanta Games were the first to include a women's tournament.\nBid committee.\nOn July 6, 2017, a United Bid Committee was officially formed by the national federations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to kick off the bidding process to bring the 2026 World Cup to North America.\nHonorary chairman of the board\nUnited bid committee board of directors\nUnited bid committee executive team\nPotential venues.\nOn August 15, 2017, the United Bid Committee released a list of 49 stadiums in 44 metropolitan markets across the three nations which will be considered for the official bid. The United Bid Committee planned to include 20–25 venues in the official bid, which was sent to FIFA in March 2018. Stadiums must have a capacity of at least 40,000 for group-round matches and at least 80,000 for the opening match and the final.\nOn September 7, 2017, the United Bid Committee announced that a total of 41 cities (with 44 venues) had submitted bids marking their official declaration of interest to be included in the final bid: Almost a month later, on October 4, 2017, the list of cities was cut down to 32 with 35 venues. During U.S. Soccer's annual general meeting in Orlando in February 2018, Gulati revealed that the list of cities had been cut down to 26 with 29 venues.\nOn March 14, 2018, Vancouver, Minneapolis and Chicago all announced that they were dropping out as potential host cities. All three cities cited concerns over the financial transparency of being a host city and cited FIFA's unwillingness to negotiate financial details as reasons for their decisions; the bid committee announced the next day they had reduced the number of cities in the bid to 23.\nCities had to submit written proposals to the United Bid Committee by January 19, 2018, before being selected by the committee.\nThe official bid has proposed the main opening match be held in either the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City or at the Rose Bowl in the Los Angeles area, that all three host countries' teams would host their first matches on the first day of the tournament and that the final match be held at MetLife Stadium in the New York City area. The bid also proposed that the two semi-final matches would be held at AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. All of the other cities in the American portion of the bid are under consideration for quarter-final matches. The bid book proposal calls for Mexico and Canada to each host seven group-stage games, two matches in the round of 32, and one in the round of 16.\nVenues excluded since start of bidding process.\nVenues that submitted bids but were rejected (2nd round).\nThe following cities were not selected as host cities bid, according to Sunil Gulati, during the 2018 US Soccer Annual General Meeting.\nSupport.\nPublic opinion.\nOn October 24, 2017, a survey of adults in Canada, Mexico, and the United States showed a broad support for Canada–United States–Mexico bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It found that 77% of North American residents are in favor of hosting the first-ever 48-team FIFA World Cup, and 81% of respondents across the three countries agree that hosting the tournament would be good for their specific country. Also, nearly six in 10 (57 percent) of those surveyed say they would be interested in attending FIFA World Cup matches if the games were played near where they live or work.\nU.S. House of Representatives.\nOn April 20, 2018, Representatives Darin LaHood and fellow co-chairs of the Congressional Soccer Caucus Kathy Castor (FL-14), Don Bacon (NE-02), Ruben Kihuen (NV-04) introduced a resolution to recognize and support the efforts of the United Bid Committee to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States. The U.S. House of Representatives adopted this resolution on April 25, 2018.\nOther government officials.\nToronto city councilors Mark Grimes and Cesar Palacio supported the bid, as well as Mayor John Tory. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante also supported it.\nOn March 13, 2018, Canadian Minister of Sport Kirsty Duncan announced in Ottawa that the Canadian federal government officially threw its support behind the North American bid for the 2026 World Cup, with the promise of up to $5 million in immediate help should the unified bid win.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto all supported the bid for the World Cup.\nMarketing.\nThe bid is branded \"United 2026\", the logo of the bid is a ball with the number 26 representing the year \"2026\" with the colors of the flags of Canada, Mexico, and the United States and the slogans are: \"United As One\" (, ). and \"Football For All\" (, ).\nOpinions.\nOn December 28, 2017, during a sports business conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, FIFA president Gianni Infantino considered the United bid to be a positive message.\nControversies.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's executive orders regarding immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries implemented in 2017 was touted as a potential risk, with Infantino saying, \"Any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.\" In response, the Trump administration sent letters to FIFA that read, in part, that Trump was \"confident\" that \"all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.\" In 2018, Trump then warned the countries that intended to support the Morocco bid to host the 2026 World Cup, tweeting: \"The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don't support us (including at the United Nations)?\" In January 2021, the travel ban was reversed by his successor Joe Biden."

        "title": "John Patrick (basketball)",
        "text": "John Patrick (born February 29, 1968) is an American professional basketball coach and former professional basketball player.\nCareer.\nPatrick attended DeMatha Catholic High School, where he played under coach Morgan Wootten, before moving to Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. He started his college career at Stanford University in 1987. Playing point guard for coach Mike Montgomery, he won the 1991 NIT Championship as a senior. Patrick led Stanford in assists per game in 1989-90 and 1990–91, while making the Pac-10 All-Academic Team his junior and senior year.\nUpon graduation, Patrick had a 13-year career as a professional basketball player, mostly representing clubs in Japan and Germany. He had a number of tryouts with NBA team Golden State Warriors, but never made the roster. While sitting out the 1994–95 season with a knee injury, he served as an assistant coach of his team (Japan Energy Griffins), but later returned to the court and split time between playing and coaching in Japan in the following years.\nIn 2003, Patrick was appointed head coach of BG Göttingen, a second-division team from Germany. He coached the Violets until 2005 and then spent the 2005–06 season as head coach for Toyota Alvark in Japan. After one year, he returned to Göttingen and guided the team to promotion to Germany's top-flight Basketball Bundesliga in 2007. Counting on a fast-paced style of play, Patrick led the team to three Bundesliga playoff appearances in four years and to the 2010 EuroChallenge title, while earning Bundesliga Coach of the Year honors in 2009 and 2010.\nHe parted company with BG Göttingen at the conclusion of the 2010–11 season to take the reins as head coach at fellow Bundesliga team s.Oliver Würzburg. Patrick led Würzburg to the playoff semifinals in 2011–12, but parted ways with the club at the end of the season.\nIn January 2013, Patrick was hired as head coach by struggling MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg, but couldn't prevent them from being relegated from the Bundesliga. However, the Ludwigsburg organization was granted a wildcard to remain in the league. Patrick guided the team to playoff berths in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In the 2017–18 season, Patrick's Ludwigsburg team reached the semi-final stage of the Champions League, where they fell short to Monaco. He was presented with the Best Coach award for the 2017-18 Champions League season. In Bundesliga play, Patrick guided Ludwigsburg to a semifinal appearance, where his team lost to Alba Berlin in May 2018. In the 2018-19 season, Patrick's Ludwigsburg side finished the Bundesliga regular season in tenth place, thus missing the playoffs.\nIn the 2019–20 season, his Ludwigsburg team had a record of 17 wins and 4 losses, while sitting in second place in the German Bundesliga standings, when play was stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. At the Bundesliga finals tournament which was organized in June 2020, he guided Ludwigsburg to its first ever appearance in the Bundesliga finals, where his team took on Alba Berlin, but lost both games. In these two games, Patrick had to replace Marcos Knight due to injury. Knight was later named Bundesliga finals tournament MVP. During the tournament, Patrick's sons Johannes and Jacob were both players on his Ludwigsburg team.\nPatrick guided Ludwigsburg to a 30–4 record in the 2020–21 Bundesliga regular season, entering the playoffs as the top seed. He garnered Bundesliga Coach of the Years honours for the third time that season. In the 2021-22 campaign, Patrick and his Ludwigsburg squad won a bronze medal in the Champions League. In Bundesliga play, Patrick coached Ludwigburg to a semifinal appearance in the 2021-22 season. After nine years as head coach of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in the German Bundesliga, Patrick left the club on June 8, 2022\nOn July 6, 2022, Patrick was appointed head coach of the Chiba Jets Funabashi. He guided the Chiba Jets to the 2023 B1 League finals where they fell short to the Ryukyu Golden Kings. During the 2022-23 season, Patrick's team set a league record by winning 24 games in a row."

        "text": "Frank Merrill (born 1948) began his career in the quarter horse industry in the 1970s when he moved to Purcell, Oklahoma. During his 50+ year career as a Quarter Horse breeder and exhibitor, Merrill accumulated numerous championship titles in several different disciplines, including halter horse competition, horse racing, reining, cutting, working cow horse, and calf roping. Two of the horses he showed, Royal Santana and Miss Jim 45, were inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2000 and 2012 respectively. In 2013, he was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) Hall of Fame, and is a past president of the AQHA. He is an AQHA director at large, a director of the National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA), a trustee of the United States Equine Foundation, and a director of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.\nEarly life.\nThe son of Ralph and Scotti Merrill of Fremont, MI., Merrill rode a horse for the first time at age 5. Riding became his passion which fueled his aspirations to become a cowboy. He rode at every opportunity, which included rides on his neighbor's horses, and the horses owned by his maternal grandparents, Dan and Dorothy Gerber. Frank won his first horse in a rodeo raffle; a mixed breed of Quarter Horse and Morgan. Frank's mother persuaded his father to let him keep the horse despite his father's objections, and that helped launch Frank's 50+ year career as an owner, breeder and exhibitor of American Quarter Horses. In 1967, Frank graduated from St. John's Northwestern Military Academy located in Delafield, WI, and attended Michigan State University. He first began showing horses in his home state of Michigan, and over time, expanded into other states.\nIn 1969, Merrill purchased the AQHA grand champion halter mare, Miss Jim 45, for $25,000 from Matlock Rose, and moved to Gainesville, TX to advance his horsemanship skills under the tuteledge of Rose and George Tyler. During the mare's lifetime, Miss Jim 45 had won 230 of 250 shows, including 176 grand champion mare titles, 33 reserve championships, and 642 halter points. She died in 1978, and in 2000 was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. While in Texas, Merrill met halter horse trainer and breeder, Jerry Wells, and they became close friends. In 1972, Merrill established the 140 acre Windward Stud ranch in Purcell, Ok., and together with Jerold Wells built a technically advanced breeding farm which became notable in the 1980s for standing prominent Quarter Horse racing sires as well as top halter and performance stallions.\nMerrill met his future wife, Robin Severinsen, at the All American Quarter Horse Congress in the early 1970s. Robin's father, Doc Severinsen, was the orchestra leader for the NBC \"Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. Robin's sister, Judy, is married to race horse trainer, Bubba Cascio. Merrill, together with his wife Robin, established a broodmare farm in Aubrey, TX where Robin lived for a while with her maternal grandmother, Ora Evans. Robin's mother, Evonne Severinsen, was a former director of penthouse services at Remington Park. Merrill courted Robin while she was living in Aubrey, and they married in 1975. They moved to Purcell, OK where he and Robin operated Windward Stud until it sold in 2006, then later established M5 Performance Bloodstock, located three miles west of Purcell in the heart of Oklahoma."

He was awarded the Harlon Hill Trophy in 2017 as the best football player in NCAA Division II and led the Lions to their second national championship in football during the 2017 season, their first since 1972. He most recently won the 2023 XFL Championship with the Arlington Renegades. Perez was named MVP of the Championship Game, leading the Renegades to a 35–26 victory over the D.C. Defenders.\nEarly years.\nPerez was born in San Diego, California, to Juan and Carla Perez. His father was a professional soccer player in his native country of Mexico. Perez grew up in the Rancho Del Rey neighborhood of Chula Vista, California and started playing quarterback at a young age in Junior High.\nAs a child, Perez went bowling with his family. Eventually, he started attending a bowling league every Tuesday at age nine before being entered into tournaments. He soon became a top rated amateur in California, bowling 12 perfect games with the plan to go to a university on a bowling scholarship.\nHe attended Otay Ranch High School. Perez played sub-varsity football his first two years, in addition to basketball. He was moved to tight end to play in ORHS's Wing T offense, but stopped playing football due to frequently being moved to different positions, never playing varsity football. He graduated from Otay Ranch in 2012.\nCollege career.\nSouthwestern College.\nPerez walked on as a football player at Southwestern College in his hometown of Chula Vista with no experience at the high school varsity level. He was recommended to switch positions but ignored it, instead opting to start as the 9th of 9 quarterbacks on the depth chart for the Jaguars, but eventually became the starter due to injuries and transfers of other players, earning the second spot on the depth chart during the fall camp of 2013. At the third week of Southwestern's 2013 season, the starter was injured, leading to Perez's debut for the team against Los Angeles Pierce College, throwing for 250 yards, two touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown, leading the team to a win. He played roughly half the season before injuring his leg. He started again the next season and led the Jaguars to a conference title and all conference honors throwing for 280 in 3 or more games and his best game of the season being against San Bernardino, throwing for 299 yards and 3 touchdowns on 31–44 attempts.\nTexas A&amp;M–Commerce.\nAfter his 2014 season at Southwestern, Perez visited NCAA Division I schools in hope of a scholarship including UC Davis, Oklahoma State and several others because of what he described as \"living on that Division I dream.\" Perez transferred to play for Texas A&amp;M–Commerce, a Division II school in Northeast Texas. He redshirted his first year on campus\nduring the 2015 season while the Lions won their second straight Lone Star Conference title with fellow Southern California native Harrison Stewart as the starting quarterback. The 2015 Lions qualified for the NCAA Division II playoffs for the first time since 1995.\nPerez nabbed the starting quarterback job over fellow redshirt transfer Gabriel Rodriguez in 2016. In doing so, he became the first player of Mexican-American or Hispanic descent to start at quarterback for the Lions. The Lions won 10 regular season games and repeated as Lone Star conference champions. The Lions defeated Colorado Mesa in the first round of the NCAA Division II playoffs, their first win in the Division II playoffs since 1991, before bowing out to the Grand Valley State Lakers in the second round. Perez was first-team All-Conference, a Harlon Hill Award nominee, and Honorable Mention All-American.\nIn 2017, Perez and the Lions went 10–1 in the regular season and finished second in the Lone Star Conference behind Midwestern State University and qualified for the NCAA Division II playoffs for the third straight year. The Lions defeated Winona State in the first round of the playoffs 20–7 and then knocked off the top ranked team in the region, the Central Washington Wildcats, in a double overtime thriller, 34–31. In the Super Region 4 final, the Lions defeated a heavily favored Minnesota State-Mankato team by a 31–21 score, setting them up to host the National semi-final against the Harding Bison at Memorial Stadium in Commerce. It was the first appearance in the semifinals since the 1980 season when the Lions advanced to the NAIA national semi-finals. The Lions downed the Bison's top ranked rushing attack 31–17 to advance to the National title game. Prior the national title game, Perez was awarded with the Harlon Hill Trophy, as the best football player in Division II. The Lions defeated the West Florida Argonauts in the national title game, giving A&amp;M–Commerce their second national title in school history and their first since joining the NCAA in 1982. Perez once again was first-team All-LSC in addition to being named National Offensive player of the year, Lone Star Conference Offensive Back of the Year, and First-team All-American. He participated in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, for his final college game. In his final season with the Lions, Perez passed for 298.3 yards per game ranking ninth throughout the entire NCAA, one of the only three players in all NCAA divisions with over 5,000 passing yards.

Their head coach was Travis Ford in his second season at Saint Louis. The team played their home games at Chaifetz Arena as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They finished the season 17–16, 9–9 in A-10 play to finish in a four-way tie for fifth place.

A Title IX investigation was opened on September 26, 2017. When exhibition season opened and during the season, Ty Graves, Adonys Henriquez and Jermaine Bishop were not on the bench during games and the team plays with eight scholarship players. January 19, 2018 the university announces that the four players were informed of the Title IX findings and given suspensions ranging from 18 to 24 months, with one player being expelled.

        "title": "2017–18 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team",
        "text": " \nThe 2017–18 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Gonzaga University in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by head coach Mark Few, who was in his 19th season as head coach. The team played its home games at McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane, Washington. This was the Bulldogs (also informally referred to as the Zags) 38th season as a member of the West Coast Conference. They finished the season 32–5, 17–1 in WCC play to win the WCC regular season championship. They defeated Loyola Marymount, San Francisco and BYU to become champions of the WCC tournament. They received the WCC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated UNC Greensboro and Ohio State to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Florida State.\nThe last weeks of the season were played against the backdrop of a potential Gonzaga move to the Mountain West Conference (MW), first publicly reported by the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" on February 28, 2018. MW commissioner Craig Thompson told the newspaper that the league had discussed expansion with six schools, with Gonzaga the only school he specifically named. Thompson added that Gonzaga could potentially join as a full but non-football member as early as the 2018–19 school year. A later \"Union-Tribune\" report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men's and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four. However, before the MW's planned vote, Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified both conferences that Gonzaga would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bulldogs team finished the 2016–17 season 37–2, 17–1 in WCC play. The season was arguably the greatest season in Gonzaga's 109-year basketball history. The Bulldogs finished with a 32–1 regular season record and did not lose a game until February. They finished ranked second in the final AP Poll, the highest final national ranking in school history. They won both the WCC regular season and tournament championships. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament and a received a No. 1 seed in the West region. They advanced to the first NCAA National Championship game in the school's history—the deepest run for a WCC team since San Francisco advanced to its third consecutive Final Four in 1957, and also the deepest run by any Division I school without a football team since Seton Hall made the championship game in 1989. With a victory over South Carolina in the national semifinal, the Bulldogs tied the NCAA Division I record for the second-most wins in a season. Their run ended in the NCAA National Championship game, where they lost to North Carolina.\nOffseason.\nPlayer departures.\nJohnathan Williams had entered the NBA draft but did not hire an agent, giving him the option to return to Gonzaga. He withdrew from the draft on May 24, the last day he could have done so to retain NCAA eligibility.\n2017 returning missionaries.\nJesse Wade graduated high school in 2015, but before enrolling in college at Gonzaga, he left for a 2-year LDS mission in Lyon, France, and will arrive on campus as a freshman in Fall 2017.\nRoster.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSchedule and results.\nGonzaga's non-conference schedule includes matchups with Washington and San Diego State on the road. Gonzaga hosted Creighton, Texas Southern, and Incarnate Word at home. Gonzaga battled Villanova on a neutral court at Madison Square Garden in the Jimmy V Classic. The Zags were invited to play in the PK80: Phil Knight Invitational, where they played against Florida, Ohio State, and Texas. The Zags played in the single-elimination WCC Tournament, which took place in March 2018 at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\nRankings.\n^Coaches did not release a Week 2 poll.&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Major League Rugby",
        "text": "Major League Rugby (MLR or USMLR) is a professional rugby union competition for clubs in North America. In the 2023 season it was contested by twelve teams: eleven from the United States and one from Canada. While operating outside of the governance and oversight of the national governing body, the league is officially sanctioned by USA Rugby—a member union of Rugby Americas North (RAN)—and is consequently part of World Rugby. The league was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.\nMLR began its first season in 2018 with seven teams. The league has since expanded, reaching an all-time high of 13 teams in the 2022 season. Twelve teams are competing in the 2024 season.\nMajor League Rugby implemented its first collegiate MLR Draft in 2020. Also in 2020, Major League Rugby teams started forming youth academies.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nIn September 2016, with at least five amateur rugby union clubs across the United States discussing a possible professional league, Dean Howes, who had previously been an executive with Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake and the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, stepped in as senior strategic advisor for Rugby Utah in an attempt to provide a pathway for expanding professional rugby stateside.\nBy February 2017, a total of nine amateur rugby union organizations including the Austin Huns, Dallas Griffins, Glendale Raptors, Houston Strikers, Kansas City Blues, Minneapolis, New Orleans RFC, Rugby Utah and the Seattle Saracens, announced their intentions to form a professional league to begin play the following year.\nOn August 15, 2017, the Austin Huns announced that it would opt-out of MLR in favor of allowing a newly branded spinoff, the Austin Elite compete in the league. The Houston Strikers rebranded themselves as the Houston SaberCats. Whereas the elite players of New Orleans, Utah, and Seattle became the New Orleans Gold, Utah Warriors, and Seattle Seawolves respectively, interests in Minneapolis were replaced by the San Diego Legion. With Kansas City and Dallas still in planning stages, the league continued as seven members for its inaugural season.\nOn November 6, 2017, Major League Rugby and CBS Sports Network announced a multi-year television partnership which marked MLR's first major television deal for broadcast rights. It was the first time in American history that a new sporting league had a national television deal prior to launch.\nEarly seasons and rapid expansion.\nThe first regular-season game in Major League Rugby history was held on April 21, 2018, when the Houston SaberCats hosted the New Orleans Gold. The final was contested between the Seattle Seawolves and the Colorado Raptors, with the Seawolves winning 23-19 to become the inaugural champions.\nIn addition to Rugby United New York, the Toronto Arrows joined the league ahead of 2019 season as the first Canadian team in MLR. Three further American clubs began play in 2020: the New England Free Jacks, Old Glory DC, and Rugby ATL. With the opening of SaberCats Stadium as Houston's permanent stadium in April 2019, MLR gained its first stadium that was specifically built for league play.\nLater in April, RUNY announced the signing of French international Mathieu Bastareaud on a loan deal from Toulon for the 2020 season. In October 2019, another major signing was made when it was announced that All Blacks international and multiple World Cup winner Ma'a Nonu would join the San Diego Legion for the 2020 season. The following December saw another World Cup winner sign with the league, namely South Africa prop Tendai Mtawarira with Old Glory DC.\nOn March 12, 2020, MLR initially suspended its 2020 season for 30 days due to the coronavirus pandemic, but then cancelled the remainder of the entire season on March 18, after five rounds had been played.\nThe LA Giltinis began competition in the 2021 season, followed by the Dallas Jackals, who entered in the 2022 season.\nAt the end of the 2022 regular season, MLR announced that the Giltinis and the Gilgronis—both owned by Adam Gilchrist, co-founder of F45 Training—were disqualified from the playoffs due to a violation of league rules, allegedly including salary cap issues. At the time of their disqualification, the Giltinis and Gilgronis were ranked first and second in the western conference. Gilchrist filed suit against the league and the two teams were expelled from the league in October following a failed attempt to sell both teams.\nThe Chicago Hounds began competition in the 2023 season. On February 8, 2023, Major League Rugby announced that the Miami Sharks would join the competition for the 2024 season. Following the 2023 season, Rugby ATL relocated from Atlanta to Los Angeles and rebranded as Rugby FC Los Angeles. In November 2023, the Toronto Arrows announced they would cease all operations following the death of founder Bill Webb and a failure to secure new investors. A week later, the New York Ironworkers announced they would also fold. In January 19, 2024, the league announced the creation of Anthem Rugby Carolina for the 2024 season. The team will serve as development team for US-eligible players, based upon the USA Hawks Under-23 men's development side. The team is financially supported by World Rugby, and unlike the other teams, its primary purpose will be to develop US-eligible players, in order to help qualify for the 2027 Rugby World Cup, and improve the USA Eagles as a competitive entity, before the USA-hosted 2031 Rugby World Cup.\nCompetition format.\nMajor League Rugby spans five months from Late February through to Early July. The 2019 regular season was a double round-robin with all clubs playing each other home and away. Each team played sixteen games, half of them at home. This was followed by a postseason for the top four teams consisting of two semi-final matches and the Championship Game to determine the season's MLR champion team.\nSince the 2020 season, MLR used a conference format. Both conferences, the Western Conference and the Eastern Conference, consisted of six teams (seven teams took part in the 2022 Western Conference). Each team playe a double round-robin within their conference, home and away, in addition to playing six games against teams from the other conference, for a total of 16 regular-season games. \nThe postseason consists of the top three teams from each conference: a wildcard game between the second and third ranked teams, followed by a playoff game between the wildcard winner and the first ranked team in the conference. The resulting playoff winners from each conference then face off in the championship final.\nThe league is structured as a closed system and, similar to other American sports leagues, does not have promotion and relegation. It operates as a single entity similar to Major League Soccer, with each team or \"franchise\" owned by the league and the franchise operators owning a share of the league.\nTeams.\nCurrent teams.\nThe Houston SaberCats, New Orleans Gold, San Diego Legion, Seattle Seawolves, and Utah Warriors have been a part of Major League Rugby since its founding in 2018. The New England Free Jacks, Old Glory DC, and Rugby FC Los Angeles (as Rugby ATL) joined in 2020; the Dallas Jackals joined in 2022; and the Chicago Hounds joined in 2023. The 2024 season includes two new clubs of the Miami Sharks and Anthem RC along with the relocated club Rugby FC Los Angeles, who had previously been Rugby ATL based in Atlanta.\nFuture teams.\nThe expansion franchise fee is US$4 million as of 2019.\nA team based in Monterrey, México, confirmed plans to join the league by 2025.\nFormer teams.\nOn April 9, 2020, the Colorado Raptors announced that they would withdraw from Major League Rugby after three seasons in the league, effective May 2, 2020, the first team to do so. Their announcement explained their withdrawal by saying that \"our greater responsibility lies in the development of American players who can win the World Cup for the United States.\" Asked to explain how withdrawing from the league would help to develop American rugby players, the Raptors referred the question to Glendale City Manager Linda Cassaday, who said on April 10, 2020, that MLR had been founded with a core mission of developing American rugby players and originally had limited teams to three foreign players, although this expanded to five players before the first season began in 2018. MLR had expanded from seven teams in 2018 to 12 in 2020 without having enough American players to fill out rosters and had raised the ceiling on foreign players to 10 per team. The Raptors believed that both this overall number of foreign players and the higher proportion of foreign to American players no longer best served the goal of developing American players who could compete successfully in the Rugby World Cup, and therefore chose to withdraw from the league to better focus their efforts on the development of American players who could compete on an international stage.\nOn October 25, 2022, Major League Rugby announced that 12 teams would compete in the 2023 season, but that neither the Austin Gilgronis, nor the LA Giltinis will participate. With the uncertainties surrounding Austin and Los Angeles' team ownership, it was determined to suspend operations of the two teams to ensure a successful 2023 season, and protect the long-term strength and continued growth of the league.\nOn November 27, 2023, Major League Rugby announced that the Toronto Arrows would cease all operations, and not compete in the 2024 season. The Arrows had sought new funding following the death of their CEO, Bill Webb, but were unable to guarantee the new backers in time.\nIn December 2023, Major League Rugby announced that the New York Ironworkers were withdrawing ahead of the 2024 season.\nMLR rivalry cups.\nIn Major League Rugby, several teams annually compete for secondary rivalry cups. Most cups are deliberately conceived as local derbies between teams in the same region.\nSummary.\nEach win is counted as an official title. Only official MLR games are considered as official rivalry games unless an exhibition game is specifically marked as a Rivalry game. Several teams now participating in cups played matches before the creation of the cups.\nInactive.\nThese Cups are currently listed as inactive, due to teams withdrawing from, or relocating within, Major League Rugby. Individual cups may return with new teams in the future.\nPlayers.\nMajor League Rugby players include those drawn from North American clubs, as well as foreign signings. Although the original concept was to limit club to three foreign players, the limit grew to five before the start of the first season, before then being increased to ten. This increased allotment of foreign players led to some criticism that MLR was not providing enough opportunities for American players to develop.\nTelevision coverage.\nMajor League Rugby programming runs in prime weekend time slots on Saturday afternoons and Sunday evenings. As of 2023, FOX Sports broadcasts select matches nationally on FS1 &amp; FS2, including the Championship Final; all other matches are available to stream live and for free on The Rugby Network.\nThe 2019 Championship game was broadcast on CBS, the first MLR game to be televised on free-to-air TV. It gained a 0.32 Sports TV rating which equated to 510,000 two-plus-person households.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLR adjusted its 2020 season schedule and turned its attention to ensuring the league would rebound with a strong showing in 2021. Matches were televised on CBS Sports Network and Fox Sports 2, among other national and local market platforms. The MLR Championship was broadcast on CBS on Sunday, August 1, 2021.\nFor the 5th (2022) and 6th (2023) seasons of MLR competition, FOX Sports nationally broadcast select matches on FS1 and FS2.

ESPN had the national and international rights to an 18-game package covering regular season matches to audiences across its various platforms for the 2018 season. The CBS Sports Network televised select matches nationally during the 2019 season. This included a Game of the Week during each of the 10 rounds of the MLR regular season along with all three post-season matches. Dan Power (Play By Play), Brian Hightower (Color Analyst) and Stacy Paetz (Sideline) were the CBS Sports commentators for the 2019 season. The remaining games were available on ESPN properties and regional sports networks.

        "text": "The 2017–18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Wolverines, led by head coach John Beilein in his 11th year, played their home games for the 51st consecutive year at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This season marked the program's 102nd season and its 101st consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nThe entering class included 2017 Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year and Mr. Basketball of Michigan Isaiah Livers. Kentucky transfer Charles Matthews became eligible to play this season after sitting out the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, while graduate transfer Jaaron Simmons became eligible to play immediately. The departing class included graduating seniors Zak Irvin and Derrick Walton who had completed their eligibility, and graduating seniors Mark Donnal and Andrew Dakich. In addition, D. J. Wilson declared for the 2017 NBA draft with two years of eligibility remaining. Jeff Meyer and Billy Donlon also departed prior to the season to take assistant coaching positions at Butler and Northwestern, respectively, and were replaced by DeAndre Haynes and Luke Yaklich.\nDuring the regular season, the team finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten Conference. They earned a 5th seed in the 2018 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament, where they won the championship, thus defending the title won by the 2016–17 Wolverines in the 2017 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament the year before. The Wolverines finished the season with a 33–8 record, setting a program record for wins during a season. The team earned the third seed in the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and reached the Championship Game before losing to Villanova.\nDepartures.\nZak Irvin and Derrick Walton graduated during their senior seasons for the 2016–17 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. Mark Donnal and Andrew Dakich graduated with one year of eligibility remaining, which they could use under the graduate transfer rule to play elsewhere. Donnal committed to play with the Clemson Tigers. Dakich committed to play with the Quinnipiac Bobcats, but could not gain acceptance into his preferred graduate program. Dakich announced in July that he had committed to play with the Ohio State Buckeyes. On June 20, Michigan assistant coach and former Butler Bulldogs assistant coach Jeff Meyer left the program to join former Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan's staff at Butler. On June 26, Chicagoan and assistant coach Billy Donlon left the program to become an assistant under long-time friend Chris Collins at Northwestern. On October 11, Fred Wright-Jones left the team, but remained at Michigan as a student on a full academic scholarship.\nPreseason.\nIn April 2017, some early pollsters included Michigan among the expected preseason top 25 teams: ESPN (#22), and \"Sports Illustrated\" (#23). However, most early polls omitted the team: Yahoo!, \"USA Today\", NBC Sports, CBS Sports, \"Sporting News\" and Bleacher Report. At the time, ESPN's Eamonn Brennan felt it was a \"foregone conclusion\" that D. J. Wilson would declare for the 2017 NBA draft, with \"Sports Illustrated\" projecting him as a first round selection. On April 10, both D. J. Wilson and Moe Wagner declared for the 2017 NBA draft, but did not hire agents, which gave them until May 24 to withdraw their names and retain their athletic eligibility to return to Michigan. On April 25, Ohio grad transfer Jaaron Simmons announced that if he did not remain entered in the 2017 NBA draft, he would transfer to Michigan. Simmons, a 2017 first team All-Mid-American Conference honoree who averaged 15.9 points and 6.5 assists in 2016–17, had declared for the draft without hiring an agent on March 28. On April 30, Jeff Goodman of ESPN reported that Wagner and Wilson were invited to the NBA draft combine and Walton was named as an alternate. On May 23, the addition of Simmons as a graduate transfer was made official as Simmons removed himself from the NBA draft process. On May 24, Wagner withdrew his name from the NBA draft and Wilson did not. Following the deadline for returning to college and its announcements, Michigan was not ranked by some media outlets, including ESPN, CBS Sports, NBC Sports, USA Today, Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports,\nIn the fall preseason, Wagner was selected to the 10-man preseason All-Big Ten team. He was also one of two Big Ten players named to the 21-man Karl Malone Award watchlist. He was a preseason John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist honoree.\n2017–18 recruits and personnel.\nOn October 23, 2015, four-star recruit Jordan Poole became the first commitment for the Class of 2017 after home gym visit from Beilein and assistant coach Jordan and multiple Michigan campus visits. Poole had several competing offers including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Memphis, Marquette, and Auburn. As a junior, Poole was a 2016 WBCA All-State Boys Basketball first team selection. On June 20, 2016, reports confirmed that Michigan had recruited Kentucky transfer Charles Matthews, who played his freshman season for the 2015–16 Kentucky Wildcats. Matthews would have to sit out the 2016–17 season. Michigan confirmed the story on July 1. The same day, Poole announced that he would transfer from Rufus King High School in Wisconsin to La Lumiere School in Indiana where he would experience a campus lifestyle, play a schedule with several ESPN broadcasts, and be teamed up with unsigned class of 2017 prospects Brian Bowen and Jeremiah Tilmon. On July 19, Spring Grove Area High School point guard Eli Brooks committed to Michigan over offers such as defending national champion Villanova, Ohio State, N.C. State, Temple and Kansas State. On August 7, 2016 Isaiah Livers committed to Michigan over contenders Michigan State, Butler, Minnesota, California and Boston College. On July 15, 2017, it was announced that Naji Ozeir would join the Michigan basketball team as a preferred walk-on. Ozeir, who had an offer withstanding from Wayne State to play on scholarship, had previously played for the Lebanese under-17 national basketball team in the 2015 Arab National Cup.

In June of that season, the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave announced that, due to financial difficulties, the two teams planned to merge into one for the start of the 2005 season. Both teams were in the Pacific League (PL), and a merger between the two would result in a team imbalance with the PL's opposing league, the Central League (CL). Soon, it was announced that a second merger was being explored between two of the remaining four PL teams. With the possibility of the PL losing a second team, discussion about possibly restructuring NPB's two-league system into one ten-team league began. PL and CL executives continued to discuss the merits of both systems until it was finally decided that the two-league system would remain intact and interleague play would be introduced in the 2005 season. \nWhen the BlueWave and the Buffaloes first announced their merger plans, the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA) pledged to do everything possible to block the merger in order to protect the rights of NPB players. Leading up to a merger vote by team owners, the JPBPA filed two injunctions in an attempt to block the proposed merger and also began making preparations in anticipation of a labor strike. After the injunctions were denied, the players association decided that the players would refuse to play in all scheduled Saturday and Sunday games for the final three weekends in September unless three conditions were met by September 10: suspension of the BlueWave/Buffaloes merger for at least one year, assurance that there would be no further team mergers, and reduction of the fees required for setting up a new NPB team. Days later, the owners voted to approve the team merger. The Friday before the first planned weekend strike, the two parties reached a last-minute agreement that allowed the players to play through the weekend. The following week, team officials definitively told the JPBPA that a one-year freeze on the merger was impossible. Negotiations continued into Friday, however, no agreement was reached. A two-day strike occurred on Saturday and Sunday, September 18–19, 2004. All twelve games scheduled for that weekend were cancelled as a result of the strike. The following Thursday, with the strike set to continue during the upcoming weekend, players and team management came to an agreement. Players agreed not to stage a strike for the second straight weekend after team representatives eased the rules of entry for new teams into the professional leagues and that one would be allowed to join the following season.\nIn late September, two Internet services companies, Livedoor and Rakuten, submitted applications to form a new team based in Sendai that would fill the void left by the merger. As the selection process progressed, both companies were given time to discuss their team and budget propositions before a panel of NPB executives. Livedoor, who had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the Buffaloes from Kintetsu earlier in the year, announced that their new baseball club would be named the \"Sendai Livedoor Phoenix\", with former MLB and NPB player Tom O'Malley attached as manager and Katsunori Kojima as general manager. Rakuten's new team planned to employ Marty Kuehnert and Yasushi Tao as general manager and manager, respectively, of their newly named \"Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\" baseball club. In November, NPB selected Rakuten over Livedoor to create a new Pacific League team to be based in Sendai. It was the first time a new team, excluding cases of mergers or acquisitions, joined NPB since 1954.\nBackground.\nUnlike Major League Baseball (MLB), Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) does not require teams to participate in any revenue sharing strategies that would help correct revenue imbalances between teams because of game attendance and television broadcasting contracts. These issues are problematic because the Yomiuri Giants, the league's most popular team, generates revenue much easier than any other team. \"Daily Yomiuri\" baseball reporter Jim Allen, for example, estimates that the Giants account for 40% of all NPB television broadcasting revenue, while the eleven remaining teams account for the other 60%. Compounding this issue, NPB employs a \"reverse designation\" draft system. Instead of teams choosing players, as in MLB, players can choose what team they would like to play for. According to former Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles general manager Marty Kuehnert, the teams with the most money could offer amateur players money under the table in exchange for their pledge. Traditionally, NPB teams existed to advertise their parent company, unlike MLB teams that are businesses attempting to maximize their profits. With prime-time advertising spots being expensive in Japan, corporations bought NPB teams for the primary purpose of keeping themselves in the public eye for the entirety of a baseball season. For years, potential profits were secondary. The recession of the 1990s and 2000s started to change this mentality.\nBlueWave/Buffaloes merger.\nFor several years leading up to 2004, the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes reported yearly losses of approximately $40 million due to a drop in home-game attendance, rising player salaries and an annual $10 million charge for the use of the Osaka Dome, their home field. Kintetsu Corporation, the railway company that owned the Buffaloes, announced in January 2004 that it was planning to put the team's name up for sale after the 2005 season in an effort to make the team more profitable. However, NPB commissioner Yasuchika Negoro denied Kintetsu's request and the plan was abandoned. Later that year, Masanori Yamaguchi, president of Kintetsu, stated that the team had \"no prospect of paying dividends (to the parent company)\" in its current state. Meanwhile, the Orix BlueWave was also struggling to post a profit. The BlueWave's home-game attendance had been steadily declining after star player Ichiro Suzuki left the team to play in MLB in 2001, and the team finished the previous two seasons in last place. In June 2004, believing no one had any interest in purchasing the team, Buffaloes officials announced plans to merge with the BlueWave for the 2005 season. Yamaguchi saw the merger with Orix as the most realistic solution to both teams' financial problems. Later that same month, a panel of NPB executives accepted the proposed merger.\nLivedoor attempts to purchase the Buffaloes.\nShortly after Kintetsu and Orix announced their plans to merge their two clubs, details emerged that Livedoor Company, an Internet services company, proposed purchasing the Buffaloes. Livedoor President Takafumi Horie confirmed that if Livedoor was to purchase the team, the Buffaloes would be kept independent in order to leave the current 12-team, two-league system intact. Kintetsu quickly issued a statement, however, stating that they had turned down the proposal from Livedoor. Days later, Kintetsu emphasized this sentiment at a press conference by categorically refusing to sell the Buffaloes to Livedoor. Even though the team's players favored the proposed purchase, Yamaguchi refused to even meet with Horie to discuss the proposal and stated that, “I wouldn’t accept such an idea” and “There isn’t even a 1% [possibility of selling the team to Livedoor].\"\nA month later, as Livedoor continued to struggle to buy the Buffaloes for reportedly up to 3 billion yen ($27.5M in 2004), Horie expressed interest in starting a new team if he was unable to complete the purchase. He acknowledged how difficult it was for a new owner to break into Japanese professional baseball but he vowed to do \"whatever [he] could\" to make it happen.\nOne-league system proposed.\nSince its creation in 1950, NPB teams had been divided into two leagues: the Central League (CL) and the Pacific League (PL). The CL is the more popular of the two leagues thanks largely to the popularity of the Yomiuri Giants. In 2004, each league had six teams; both the Buffaloes and the BlueWave were Pacific League teams. The potential merger between the two clubs would drop the number of PL teams from six to five, which would then create a team imbalance between the two leagues. During a July 7 owners' meeting where the twelve team owners approved the Orix-Kintetsu merger, talk of a second pair of PL teams merging arose. At the meeting, Seibu Lions owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi stated that another merger between two of the remaining four PL teams was being explored. Rumors then surfaced about an ongoing merger plan between the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. Marines owner Akio Shigemitsu denied these rumors, however he made it clear that his team was open to the possibility. Eventually, it was revealed that Daiei had explored merger possibilities with both Seibu and Lotte and talks advanced with Lotte, however no agreement was ever reached. Eventually, Daiei struck up a deal with multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group, who purchased all 14,432,000 of Daiei's shares in the team (accounting for approximately 98% of the team's shares) on November 30, 2004, for 15 billion yen. This purchase was approved at an NPB owners meeting on December 24, 2004, and came into effect on January 28, 2005.\nWith the possibility of the PL losing a second team, discussion about possibly restructuring NPB's two-league system into one ten-team league began. Tsutsumi and Yomiuri Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe favored the idea of combining the Central and Pacific Leagues into one league. Watanabe even outlined a plan for a new championship competition he dubbed the \"Emperor’s Cup\" that would replace the Japan Series if NPB was contracted to one league. His idea involved reducing the number of regular-season games to allow for a tournament that would pit teams against each other based on their geographic location. The regular-season winner and the tournament winner would then play each other to determine a champion.\nMeanwhile, senior adviser to the Hanshin Tigers Senichi Hoshino, who was manager of the club when they won the CL championship the previous year, argued to keep the current two-league format. He heavily criticized team owners for ignoring the voices of the players and fans, and it is believed that this criticism helped cause some team owners to abandon the movement toward one league. Not long after Hoshino's comments, Tigers team president Katsuyoshi Nozaki suddenly declared he was in favor of keeping the Central and Pacific League set-up and the team became the biggest supporter of the idea. Soon, the majority of the other CL teams also favored the current two-league system. After garnering the support of fellow CL teams the Yakult Swallows and the Yokohama BayStars, Tigers' executives planned a meeting with all of the Central League teams excluding the Giants to attempt to draft an agreement against the move to a one-league system. Tigers' president Katsuyoshi Nozaki proposed interleague play as a possible solution. He claimed that interleague play would allow Central and Pacific League teams to play each other an equal number of times so that it would seem that it was a one-league system, however the All-Star Series and the Japan Series could be saved. In the past, interleague play had been rejected by the CL teams because they did not want the PL teams to cut into the money they would receive from games played against the hugely popular Giants. Soon the last two CL teams, the Chunichi Dragons and the Hiroshima Carp, both expressed support for maintaining the two-league system, at least through the next season.\nPL executives then came out strongly in favor of the Giants' one-league system with Pacific League President Tadao Koike citing the difficulty in operating a league consisting of only five or even four teams. On July 26, NPB held a seven-hour meeting in order to talk about the merits of both proposals, however no agreement could be reached. The issue was again discussed during a meeting in mid-August, though again the twelve teams could not agree on a solution. During the meeting, all six PL teams reaffirmed that they were looking to move forward with their one-league plan if a second team merger occurred and ultimately brought the PL's team count from six to four, though no details of a second merger were disclosed. Most of the Central League teams requested that the Pacific League teams draw up a concrete timetable that explained the details of their plan to shift NPB into a one-league system so the issue could be further discussed during the next owners meeting on September 8.\nA week later, CL President Hajime Toyokura acknowledged that PL officials had informed him that they were working on specific plans for a second merger to present at a meeting a week later, however commissioner Yasuchika Negoro confirmed that nothing had yet been presented about a second merger plan and that he knew nothing about it. Citing history and tradition, Negoro also went on record to say that maintaining the two-league system was a priority for him. These comments came after meeting with Democratic Party of Japan policy chief Yoshito Sengoku and other lawmakers to discuss the state of Japanese professional baseball. Sengoku himself also opposed the shift to a single league and was leading a campaign to put forward a proposal to keep the two-league system. Public support also seemed to favor keeping the current system. In a nationwide telephone survey conducted by Kyodo News, around 74% of people in Japan were in favor of maintaining the current two six-team leagues with only 12% supporting a shift to one league.\nMerger approved.\nWhile NPB team owners and officials were discussing the possibility of a second team merger, fans and players were still opposing the first planned merger between the Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave. After the merger plans were first announced in June, a group of supporters of the BlueWave turned in a petition signed by 17,800 fans who were in favor of maintaining the team's base in Kobe after the probable merger with the Kintetsu Buffaloes next season. Not long after, Buffaloes players began voicing opposition to the plans as well, stressing that all possibilities of keeping the team intact should be explored before a merger is decided upon.\nDuring the All-Star Series in mid-July, the Japanese baseball players' union, the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA), gathered and discussed the possibility of a players' strike at some time in the future if the owners refused to talk with the players.\nBuffaloes and BlueWave fans also assembled near the stadiums hosting the All-Star Series to collect signatures, with the intention of presenting petitions opposing the Kintetsu-Orix merger to baseball officials. By the end of July, the Giants' players association joined the Buffaloes', the Dragons', the BayStars', the Swallows' and the Tigers' to become the sixth team of twelve to hold a signature drive to oppose a move to a one-league format and the planned BlueWave and Buffaloes merger.\nOn August 10, Kintetsu and Orix advanced merger plans by officially signing an agreement that outlined the basic details of the planned team merger, including that the new merged club would be run by a new company jointly owned by the parent companies of the two teams, 80% by Orix and the rest by Kintetsu. The next day, approximately 300 fans protested the merger by marching with signs and chantings slogans in Tokyo's Hibiya district. Days later, JPBPA members voted overwhelmingly for the right to strike as part of a bid to maintain the two-league system and prevent team mergers. Of about 750 members of the players’ union, 98% voted in favor of strike rights. Fewer than ten members opposed striking. The Japan Trade Union Confederation (RENGO) also supported the association by giving advice on how to set up a strike as well as labor-management negotiation strategies and how to effectively circulate petitions.\nThe Kintetsu and Orix merger plan was finalized in late August when the two teams signed a formal contract. That same day, JPBPA filed for an injunction against the planned merger with the Tokyo District Court. The suit was filed by the JPBPA head Atsuya Furuta as well as Koichi Isobe and Takashi Miwa, who represented the players of Kintetsu and Orix, respectively. The association decided to take legal action after NPB officials either turned down or ignored a series of demands made by the JPBPA. These demands included establishing a special committee to handle contractual issues for the players affected by the merger, including club management and players’ representatives in any decision-making processes of such a committee, and to postpone the merger for at least one year to reassess its advisability. The documents filed with the court outlined the association's demands to establish a special committee that would meet and adopt resolutions before any decisions were made and to allow the JPBPA to conduct collective negotiations on a range of merger-related issues, as a large number of players would be expected to lose their jobs should the merger go through.\nMeanwhile, Pacific League President Koike quoted Giants president Watanabe as telling him that if the number of teams in the PL was reduced to four through team mergers, both the Central League and Pacific League should have five teams each, with the Giants moving to the PL to equalize the number of teams in each league. Commissioner Negoro addressed these statements, saying that NPB was not considering having the Giants switch leagues. He also stated that no decision had been made concerning whether Japanese baseball would contract to one league or keep the two-league system in some form, but that both options were being explored. Lions owner Tsutsumi, who had first revealed plans of a second PL team merger plan back in July, then denied recent reports that his club would merge with the Marines but offered no other details about the rumored second merger.\nNPB officials agreed to postpone the official merger vote that was planned to occur on September 8 pending a judgement on the JPBA's injunction request, however the Tokyo District Court rejected the association's request one week after it was submitted and the vote proceeded as planned. Following the District Court's decision, the association immediately appealed to the Tokyo High Court, however this appeal was also rejected several days later. The same day the association lost their injunction appeal, NPB executives met to discuss the merger and league realignment. The twelve owners voted and approved the Buffaloes and BlueWave merger plan, leaving the PL with five teams instead of six for the 2005 season. They also agreed to maintain the two-league format but would explore the idea of introducing interleague games for the next season. And finally, while they also agreed to reconsider the requirements for new teams to enter the leagues, they decided that they could not put off the merger plans for another season because of the dire financial circumstances of the Buffaloes, thus setting the stage for a player strike.\nPlayers strike.\nWhen the Orix BlueWave and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes announced their merger plans in June, JPBPA head and then-Yakult Swallows catcher Furuta vowed that his organization would do everything possible to block the merger in order to protect the rights of the 752 professional players in NPB. It was estimated that up to 100 players and team personnel could lose their jobs as a result of the merger. Furuta claimed that \"Japanese baseball [was] at a crossroads” and it was \"the most important time in [their] 70-year history\". In addition to submitting a court injunction to block the proposed merger, the association received the support of the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) leading up to the merger vote. The JFTC called on NPB to offer up a clear explanation as to why Livedoor's bid to buy the Buffaloes wasn't considered. Anticipating the possibility of a player strike, the JPBPA also consulted with the Major League Baseball Players Association on how to proceed. According to Furuta, however, Japanese baseball's possible strike situation was different from MLB's 1994 strike because the Japanese players had the support of their fans. By September, close to one million fans had signed petitions opposing the merger.\nFuruta was skeptical of the losses reported by the teams but conceded that if the losses were accurate then player salaries would have to be adjusted accordingly. The players' association made several suggestions to improve the teams' financial situations, including relaxing the rules on how much player salaries could be reduced as well as proposing a luxury tax that would result in the reduction of player salaries. Furthermore, the JPBPA supported the two-league system, proposed interleague play and a fairer distribution of television broadcast revenue.\nDays before the planned merger vote, the players' association decided that they would refuse to play all games scheduled on Saturdays and Sundays for the rest of September unless three conditions were met by September 10: suspension of the BlueWave/Buffaloes merger for at least one year, assurance that there would be no further team mergers, and reduction of the fees required for setting up a new NPB team. Despite this ultimatum, owners went ahead and approved the merger two days later. The next day, team management and players met for six hours in Osaka looking to agree on a compromise deal in an attempt to avert a strike the next day, but failed to reach an agreement. On Friday, the next day and the final day before the proposed strike, a last-minute agreement was reach between the two parties that allowed the players to play through the weekend. The JBLPA conceded some demands once team representatives assured the players that there would be no further mergers and that negotiations on the other two issues would continue until September 17, the next day the players could strike under the association's plans.\nOn the following Thursday, during on-going negotiations, team officials definitively told the JPBPA that a one-year freeze on the BlueWave/Buffaloes merger, one of the three demands set by the association to avoid a strike, was impossible. Two Internet service companies had applied to start new Japanese baseball teams in the wake of the professional leagues losing a team, however NPB representatives maintained that the 2006 season would be the earliest a new team could enter. The players wanted any new teams ready for the next season. Negotiations continued into Friday and lasted four hours past the 5 pm deadline, however, no agreement was reached and the players proceeded to stage the first and only strike in Japanese professional baseball history. The two-day strike occurred on Saturday and Sunday, September 18–19, 2004. All twelve games scheduled for that weekend were cancelled as a result of the strike. In place of these games, players instead staged a variety of events at stadiums and other venues. These events included autograph sessions, on-field baseball training, and opportunities for fans to meet players.\nThe following Thursday, with the strike set to continue the during the upcoming weekend, players and management came to an agreement. Players agreed not to stage a strike for the second straight weekend after team representatives eased the rules of entry for new teams into the professional leagues and that one would be allowed to join the following season. The two-day strike caused economic losses totaling approximately 1.89 billion yen (17.2 million in 2004), according to researchers from Osaka Prefecture University. Estimated attendance at the 12 games would have generated 1.68 billion yen through ticket, food and drink sales. Additionally, an estimated 200 million yen in broadcast revenue was lost from the two cancelled Yomiuri Giants games. Players received salary cuts totaling 190 million yen.\nCreation of a new team.\nAfter Livedoor had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the Buffaloes from Kintetsu earlier in the year, Livedoor President Takafumi Horie indicated that he intended to start a new professional baseball team that would fill the void left by the merger of the Orix BlueWave and the Buffaloes. On September 17, Livedoor established a new professional team and applied for team ownership with NPB. Horie said that the team would be composed of players who were left jobless after the Buffaloes/BlueWave merger and would be based in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. One week later a second Internet services company, Tokyo-based Rakuten, also submitted a formal application to Japanese professional baseball to form a team. Like Horie, Rakuten president Hiroshi Mikitani also expressed a desire to locate his new team in Sendai.\nIn early October, the public screening process to select one of the two companies and allow them form a new NPB team began. Both Livedoor and Rakuten were given an hour and a half to discuss their team and budget propositions before a panel of five Japanese baseball executives. The panel consisted of Central League chairman Hajime Toyokura and the head officials of the Yomiuri Giants, the Yokohama BayStars, the Seibu Lions and the Chiba Lotte Marines. The screening standards include the adequacy of the applications, the prospective continuity and stability of the planned baseball teams, the prospective financial standings of the applicants and planned teams, their planned baseball facilities, and what their plans were to bring Miyagi Stadium to NPB standards, and how fast said plans would take, as at the time, the stadium only sat 23,000. Rakuten's plans were to focus on said renovations offseason, and keep the capacity at 23,000 for the meantime, allocating 3.2 billion yen to do said renovations, with it to be completed before the 2006 season. Livedoor, meanwhile, claimed they only needed 2.5 billion yen and could finish it in the middle of the 2005 season. \nAnother public examination screening, this time targeting both companies' morals, was held on the 14th of October, where both companies, this time, were questioned on how they would prevent minors from accessing pornographic sites hosted on both companies' web hosting services. Livedoor's response, where they said they had no control over who can access their sites and who could not, eventually contributed to their downfall. Rakuten, meanwhile, stated they were able to do that. \nAs screenings were held weekly through October, more details about each potential new team emerged. Livedoor announced that their baseball club would be named the \"Sendai Livedoor Phoenix\", with former MLB and NPB player Tom O'Malley attached as manager and Katsunori Kojima as general manager. Rakuten, likewise, announced Marty Kuehnert and Yasushi Tao as general manager and manager, respectively, of their newly named \"Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\" baseball club. Both clubs planned play out of Miyagi Stadium. Upon registering the trademark for their name, Rakuten learned that Livedoor had registered an \"eagles\" trademark one day earlier, as Horie, in retaliation of Rakuten winning the bid over his company, trademarked it to avoid them using it. This led to a legal battle that ended quickly, as Rakuten would end up just paying Horie to allow them to use the name.\nA telephone survey conducted by Kyodo News during the selection period of 300 people living in the Tōhoku region indicated that Livedoor was the early fan favorite to win the right to start a new team in Sendai. In the survey, forty percent of the respondents supported Livedoor's bid compared to only seven percent supporting Rakuten. Rakuten, however, was considered the more likely of the two companies to be chosen by NPB. Rakuten president Mikitani had extensive connections in established Japanese business circles and already operated another sports team, the soccer club Vissel Kobe in Japan's J.League. On November 2, NPB selected Rakuten over Livedoor to create a new Pacific League team to be based in Sendai. It was the first time a new team, excluding cases of mergers or acquisitions, joined NPB since the creation of the now-defunct Takahashi Unions in the Pacific League in 1954. The choice of Rakuten over Livedoor was a smart one for NPB, as after Horie's arrest in 2006 over securities and accounting fraud, Livedoor also went down with it.\nThe Eagles and the newly merged Orix Buffaloes constructed their rosters from the 107 players left over from the dissolved Kintetsu and original Orix teams during a special distribution draft held on November 8. Before the draft, Orix was allowed to select 25 players that would be protected from the distribution process and thus giving them preferential signing rights. Included in this list were all free agents and foreign players. Rakuten was then allowed to select 20 unprotected players, not including any first- or second-year players. After that, the first- and second-year players were unprotected and Orix and Rakuten alternating selecting 20 more players for the last round of the draft. Any player that was not selected during the draft defaulted back to Orix, guaranteeing that all players would play the next season. Of the 40 players the Eagles selected, 17 were pitchers and 23 were position players. On Orix's list of protected players was Hisashi Iwakuma, the Kintetsu Buffaloes' pitcher who led the league in wins the previous season. Iwakuma, however, had wished to be left off of the list as he had no intention of playing for the newly formed team because of their involvement in the merger. He insisted that Orix team president Takashi Koizumi live up to his pledge that he would sincerely listen to the players involved in the merger regarding their futures. After four rounds of talks between Iwakuma and Koizumi, negotiations broke down and the JPBPA was brought in to mediate. Eventually, Orix agreed to trade Iwakuma to the Eagles in exchange for cash.\nAftermath.\nDays after the players' strike, owners met on September 2 and approved a plan to hold interleague regular-season games during the 2005 season.\nThe Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes ended their 55-year history when the team merged with the Orix BlueWave to form the Orix Buffaloes on December 1. The new team used both Kintetsu's former home stadium, the Osaka Dome, and Orix's, the Yahoo! BB Stadium in Kobe, as their home stadiums. It was the first team merger since the Daiei Unions were absorbed by the Mainichi Orions in November 1957.\nThe results of a nationwide telephone survey conducted by Kyodo News showed that 61.6 percent of respondents believed Japanese baseball would become more interesting with the addition the new Sendai-based Golden Eagles while 26.1 percent said they were unconvinced that the addition of the team would not increase fan interest.\nIt would take only 8 years for the Eagles to win a Japan Series championship after their founding in 2004, winning the 2013 Japan Series in 7 games over the Yomiuri Giants. On the flipside, it took the Buffaloes 18 years to win their first Japan Series since the merger, taking home the 2022 Japan Series in 7 games over the Tokyo Yakult Swallows."

        "text": "The Monster Energy Cup is an exhibition race hosted by the AMA Supercross Championship that takes place in the Fall. The event started in 2011 and has been held at the Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas every year since. A US $1 million purse is available to any rider who is able to win all three featured races.\nFormat.\nThe Monster Energy Cup consists of three 10-lap Main Events for riders of 450cc 4-stroke motorcycles; the same 22 riders compete in all three events. The event uses Olympic-style scoring, so the rider who gets the lowest overall score (a 1+1+1=3 being a perfect score for winning all three Main Events) is declared the winner. The overall winner pockets $100,000 if he fails to win all three Main Events.\nAmateur and junior divisions also compete at the Monster Energy Cup.\nHistory.\nThe Monster Energy Cup has been held at Sam Boyd Stadium each year since 2011. A $1 million purse for anyone who could win all three 450cc Main Events has been on the line each year, and has been won three times.\nThe first time came in the inaugural running of the event when Ryan Villopoto went 1-1-1 for the million. Justin Barcia won overall in 2012, then Ryan Dungey would have won in 2013 but forgot to take the mandatory \"Joker Lane\" during the first Main Event, costing him five positions and ultimately the overall win. Trey Canard came close to winning all three Main Events in 2014, but crashed out in the final main event handing the overall to Davi Millsaps. Ken Roczen won in 2015 and would have gone back-to-back in 2016 but crashed during the second Main Event, giving the overall to Eli Tomac. In 2017, Marvin Musquin became the second rider in the event's history to win all three Main Events. In 2018, sweepstakes winner Jesse Hebert was also in the running for US$1 million if one rider could win all three Main Events. Eli Tomac did, and so both Tomac and Hebert won $1 million. Adam Cianciarulo took home the crown in 2019, which was the last edition.\nThe Monster Energy Cup was scheduled in 2020 and was going to take place on October 10, 2020 but the event was canceled in mid 2020 because of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic. The venune was going to be held at Dignity Health Sports Park which supercross had never competed at beforehand. The stadium however did host some X Games moto events in the late 2000s and 2010s.\nMonster Energy Cup Winners.\nNote: Winners listed in bold denote the million dollar winners."

Each county side played one fixture against a MCCU side ahead of the start of the 2017 County Championship. Following Leicestershire's match against Loughborough MCCU, bowler Charlie Shreck was found guilty of using obscene language or gestures. This was Leicestershire's fifth fixed penalty in 12 months, resulting in them being deducted 16 points for the 2017 County Championship season."

The championship round was a single-elimination tournament. Japan and the Netherlands advanced to the championship round from Pool E. Puerto Rico and the United States advanced from Pool F. Defending champions Dominican Republic were eliminated in the second round.\nPuerto Rico and the Netherlands played a semifinal game on March 20, while the United States and Japan played on March 21. Puerto Rico and the United States advanced to the championship game. The United States defeated Puerto Rico to win the championship. Marcus Stroman was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.\nResults.\nSemifinal 1 − Puerto Rico 4, Netherlands 3.\nPrior to the game, Didi Gregorius was removed from the Netherlands roster due to a shoulder injury. The Netherlands gained Kenley Jansen, who did not pitch in the previous rounds. Rick van den Hurk started for the Netherlands and Jorge López started for Puerto Rico.\nWladimir Balentien and Carlos Correa both hit two-run home runs in the first inning. T. J. Rivera hit a home run for Puerto Rico in the second inning. The Netherlands tied the score on a run batted in (RBI) double by Shawn Zarraga in the fifth inning. From there, the game remained tied through the 10th inning.\nStarting in the 11th inning, teams start each inning with runners on first and second base as a means of sudden death. The Netherlands failed to score in the top of the 11th inning, but Puerto Rico scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the inning.\nSemifinal 2 − United States 2, Japan 1.\nJapan reached the semifinals with wins in all six games played in the previous rounds. Tanner Roark started for the United States in the semifinal game, while Tomoyuki Sugano started for Japan. Roark pitched four scoreless innings, while Sugano allowed one run in six innings. The United States scored a run on an RBI single by Andrew McCutchen in the fourth inning, and Ryosuke Kikuchi hit a home run for Japan in the sixth inning to tie the game. The United States scored another run in the eighth inning to take the lead, and Luke Gregerson earned the save. Though the Japanese team was considered the strongest defensive team in the WBC, misplays by Kikuchi at second base and Nobuhiro Matsuda at third base led to each of the United States's runs.\nFinal − United States 8, Puerto Rico 0.\nPuerto Rico reached the championship undefeated in the tournament, winning all seven games played. Puerto Rico defeated the United States when they faced each other in Pool F. In the championship game, Seth Lugo started for Puerto Rico, and Marcus Stroman started for the United States. Ian Kinsler hit a two-run home run for the United States in the third inning, while Puerto Rico's offense faltered, failing to score a single run in the championship game. Kinsler scored again in the fifth inning on a single by Christian Yelich, and Yelich scored on an infield single by McCutchen. Two more runs scored on a bases loaded single by Brandon Crawford in the seventh inning, and Giancarlo Stanton scored the inning's third run with an RBI single. Meanwhile, Stroman did not allow a hit for the first six innings of play. The United States added another run in the eighth inning with an RBI single by McCutchen. The United States completed the shutout to win the championship. Stroman was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player."

Pool A was a round-robin tournament. Each team played the other three teams once, with the top two teams advancing to Pool E.\nPrior to the start of the tournament, ESPN considered Team Israel, ranked 41st in the world, to be the biggest underdog in the tournament, referring to them as the \"Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC\".\nTeam Israel (3−0) and Team Netherlands (2−1) qualified for the next round, in Japan. Israel became the first baseball team to go undefeated in the first round of the WBC’s main draw after entering the main draw by winning in a qualifying round. Israel's catcher, Ryan Lavarnway, was named Pool A MVP, after going 5-for-9 (.556/.692/.889), with four walks, a home run, and three RBIs.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPool A MVP: Ryan Lavarnway\nResults.\nIsrael 2, South Korea 1.\nIn their first game Israel defeated the Pool A favorite South Korea, ranked # 3 in the world, in 10 innings by a score of 2−1. Israel's winning pitcher Josh Zeid said the win was the pinnacle of his career: \"This has to be it. This has to be the top, top win as a team, I think in my career. I’ve been lucky enough to be part of a couple of championships in the lower levels in the minor leagues and in high school, but nothing compares to this stage. Israel's third baseman Ty Kelly tweeted: \"Definitely the most stressful game I’ve ever been a part of. But it was worth it.\" Israel's catcher Ryan Lavarnway noted after the win: \"two generations ago, the way that this team was put together, would have meant that we were being killed... It means a lot more than that we're here.\"\nIsrael 15, Chinese Taipei 7.\nAgainst Chinese Taipei, ranked # 4 in the world, Israel won again, this time by the score of 15−7. Israel's 15 runs were the most Taiwan had ever given up in a game in World Baseball Classic play. Taiwan manager Kuo Tai-yuan said of Israel: \"That's a very scary team.\"\nNetherlands 5, South Korea 0.\nThe Netherlands shut out South Korea, 5−0, handing the host team its second loss and raising the prospect of South Korea's second early exit since 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nNetherlands 6, Chinese Taipei 5.\nThe Netherlands defeated Chinese Taipei in the ninth inning with a walk-off walk, keeping Taipei from advancing to the next round since the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nIsrael 4, Netherlands 2.\nIsrael beat the Netherlands, ranked # 9 in the world and including a number of prominent Major Leaguers, 4−2 as Israeli relief pitcher Josh Zeid got the save. In what NBC reported was thought to be the tallest batter-pitcher matchup in baseball history, the Dutch team’s pitcher Loek van Mil walked Israel's first baseman Nate Freiman.\nSouth Korea 11, Chinese Taipei 8.\nSouth Korea took third place in the pool, as it beat Taiwan in 10 innings, 11−8. Taiwan, which came in last in the pool, will now need to play qualification games in order to qualify for the next WBC tournament."

The league run under the Italian Volleyball Federation rules and promotion to the Serie A1 is awarded.\nHistory.\nFollowing the expansion of the number of teams in Serie A in the 1970s, the league was split into two divisions in 1977; Serie A1 and Serie A2. The teams in Serie A2 were split into two pools where the winners of the two pools were promoted to Serie A1. In the early 1990s the number of teams in Serie A2 was reduced to 16 teams and the two pools were replaced by a single pool. The split pools made a temporary comeback in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons.\nIn the 2018–19 regular season of Serie A2 the number of teams increased to 18 and the teams are once again split into two pools. At the end of the regular season, the top five teams in each pool are qualified for the promotion pool. The winner of the promotion pool is promoted directly to Serie A1, while the teams ranked from 2nd to 7th are qualified for the promotion playoffs. Just like in previous seasons, the winner of the playoff finals is also promoted to Serie A1.\nIn the 2019–20 season the number of teams participating in the regular season of Serie A2 increased to 20, with 10 teams in each of the two pools. The number of teams qualified for the promotion playoffs also increased from six teams to eight teams. In the 2022–23 season it was changed so only the four teams ranked from the 2nd to 5th in the promotion pool are qualified for the playoffs."

VSA has been an affiliate of FIVB and CAVB since 1992. Its offices are located in Johannesburg, and its president is Anthony Mokoena. The organization holds its presidential elections every 4 years; the next election is set to occur in 2024.\nHistory.\nIn 1992, it was decided that a single governing body was needed to regulate volleyball in South Africa. VSA was the first national volleyball federation in South Africa to include members of all races. It was a merge of the separate white and black controlled leagues that had been split due to the Apartheid regime, the racist regime that existed in South Africa between the late 1940s to the early 1990s.\nThe previous division in sport based on race resulted in the existence of two separate bodies, each believing that they were the primary organization responsible for developing the game of volleyball in South Africa. The white athletes were playing for the South African Volleyball Union (SAVU), while the Amateur Volleyball Association of South Africa (AVASA) represented people of color. AVASA had significant ties to the Black Consciousness Movement, which encouraged solidarity between the races, which led many to believe they would be open to forming a unitary organization. This turned out to be incorrect, as AVASA refused to merge their teams with those of white South Africans.\nIn 1990, a group of administrators broke away from the AVASA to form the South African Volleyball Congress (SAVCON) which championed the desegregation of volleyball and began negotiations between the two entities. These actions were recognized by the National Sports Congress, who were responsible for encouraging unification amongst segregated athletic teams across South Africa. With the encouragement of SAVCON and the National Sports Congress, the AVASA and SAVU began the negotiation process necessary to forming a desegregated national volleyball federation. On 11 February 1992, Volleyball South Africa was created to be the unified national volleyball federation of South Africa\nVSA has been recognised by FIVB from 1992 and is a member of CAVB, the African Volleyball Confederation."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1877–78",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured New Zealand in January and February 1878, before their 1878 tour of England. It was the first overseas tour by a representative Australian team.\nThe Australians played seven matches against provincial teams, six of which fielded 22 players (the other team, Canterbury, fielded 15) with the aim of providing more evenly-matched contests. As the matches were not 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class.\nThe team had assembled in November 1877, playing matches against teams in four Australian colonies.\nThe team.\nJohn Conway was the manager and umpire, standing with a local umpire in each match. William Gibbes, a clerk in the New South Wales audit department, was the assistant manager, who preceded the arrival of the team to finalise tour arrangements. Frank Allan was named in the original 12-man team but pulled out of the trip shortly before the team left Australia, suffering from sciatica, leaving the Australians with just 11 players. Gibbes played in the match against Wellington, relieving Boyle.\nThe matches.\nSpofforth took 14 for 25 in the first innings; 11 of his victims were bowled. Charles Bannerman opened Australia's innings and scored 125 not out, which was the Australians' only century of the tour. One of his hits over square leg landed in an orchard 50 metres from the ground. Horan made 53. In the first innings the Southland number 10, John Wesney, made 39 not out, and during a 21st-wicket partnership of 27 struck a ball from Spofforth over the fence.\nThe Australians' ship berthed at Bluff early on the morning of the match, they arrived by train at Invercargill at 10 o'clock, and the match began at noon. The match days were declared half-holidays in Invercargill, and special concerts were held each evening at the Theatre Royal.\nGarrett took 7 for 25 and 13 for 33. The highest score in the match was 28 by the Otago batsman Hugh MacNeil. The Otago opening bowler Gordon Millington took 5 for 44, helping Otago achieve a 32-run first-innings lead.\nCharles Bannerman made 45, the only score on either side higher than 18. A public holiday was declared in the town for the match.\nTom Horan later wrote that the ground resembled a \"worn-out potato paddock on which the lovers of the noble game endeavour to play to the detriment of their legs, body and head\".\nCanterbury asked to play on even terms, with 11 players a side, but the Australians refused, hoping to prolong the game and thus increase the gate takings. Eventually it was settled that Canterbury would field 15 players, but before the match the reporter in the Christchurch newspaper \"The Lyttelton Times\" regretted the decision not to field 18. Without exceptional luck, he said, \"I am afraid we shall have to put up with defeat\". Interest in the match was high, and the largest Christchurch businesses and law firms closed on each day of the match at midday, which was the scheduled time for play to begin.\nThe sides agreed to play on a different pitch for each innings, and the Australians got the worse of the arrangement of the first day, when the bowling of the brothers Charlie and William Frith was \"almost unplayable\" on a \"springy\" pitch, and despite dropping several catches Canterbury dismissed the Australians for 46. When Canterbury batted, Spofforth bowled at his fastest, taking 9 for 77, all his victims being bowled, several by yorkers, but Arthur Ollivier (36) and the captain, William Neilson (26), defied the bowling and took the score to 105 for 10 at stumps.\nAfter rain washed out the second and third days, a crowd of 8000 turned up to watch the fourth day's play. Tom Horan scored 58 not out, but the rest of the Australian batsmen were troubled by Edwin Fuller, who took 8 for 35, finishing the innings off on the fifth day. Canterbury needed 55 to win, and completed their victory after eight wickets had fallen.\nIn all 20,000 spectators watched the match, but as the field was in a public park no admission fee could be charged, and the Australians' takings were disappointing. The result caused some surprise in Australia, where the newspapers mixed their tributes to the good play of the Canterbury side with doubts about the pitch, the tour schedule and the New Zealand umpiring.\nThis match was the only one the 1877-78 Australians lost. It was not until the 1966–67 season that a team representing Australia suffered a first-class defeat in New Zealand – also at the hands of Canterbury.\nSpofforth took 14 for 40 in the first innings, 11 of them bowled. George Bailey's 33 not out was the highest score in the match. As the match was completed early on the third day, a single-innings match was played to fill in the time, Wellington scoring 213 all out and the Australians 6 for 1.\nIn Wellington all government offices and banks and most businesses were closed on the Monday and Tuesday afternoons of the match. The Wellington cricketers held a ball for the Australians on the evening of the 28th, and the dancing continued \"till long past midnight\".\nSpofforth took 11 for 33 and 11 for 26; 16 of his victims were bowled. Tom Garrett's 52 was by far the highest score. J. Liddle took 5 for 51 for Hawke's Bay. The first day of the match, a Friday, was declared a public holiday in Napier for the occasion.\nThe Australians arrived in Napier on the \"Wanaka\" from Wellington on the morning of the match, then travelled by train to Hastings. The match started at two o'clock, \"in Mr Braithwaite's paddock at Hastings, about a mile from the railway station\". Rather than toss a coin to decide who would bat first, the Australians asked to be allowed to field, in order to work off the effects of their journey.\nSpofforth took 13 for 42 and 9 for 26; Garrett took 11 for 11 in the second innings. For Auckland Dan Lynch took the first five Australian wickets and finished with 5 for 67. Bailey's 44 not out was the highest score.\nThe original itinerary included a three-day match against the \"United strength of New Zealand\" from 14 to 16 February.\nAssessments.\nThe weather was generally cool, cloudy and damp throughout, although only three full days were lost to the weather.\nBowlers had the upper hand. Apart from Charles Bannerman's century against Southland, Horan scored two fifties and Garrett one. All 22 of the opposition fielded at once, which slowed the Australians' scoring.\nCharles Bannerman led the Australian batting with 284 runs, Horan scored 187, and Bailey 128. Only four New Zealand batsmen, all in South Island teams, reached 20; John Wesney of Southland was the highest scorer among them with 39 not out. Spofforth took 102 wickets at an average of 3.85, although in several matches he bowled only in the first innings.\nThe Australians returned to Australia and played several matches in New South Wales and Victoria in March before sailing for England."

The Bruins were led by fifth-year head coach Steve Alford and played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members in the Pac-12 Conference. They finished the season 21–12, 11–7 in Pac-12 play to finish in a three-way tie for third place.\nThe Bruins opened their new practice facility, the Mo Ostin Basketball Center. They defeated Stanford in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament to advance to the semifinals where they lost to Arizona. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, where they lost 65–58 in the First Four to St. Bonaventure for the Bonnies' first tournament win in 48 years. It was the first time in UCLA's history that they had been relegated to a First Four play-in game. It was the first time in the school's four tournament appearances under Alford that they did not advance to the Sweet 16.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bruins finished the 2016–17 season 31–5 overall; and 15–3 in the conference. During the season, UCLA was invited and participated in the Wooden Legacy in Anaheim, California. UCLA defeated Portland, Nebraska, and Texas A&amp;M to earn 1st place. UCLA also defeated Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic in Paradise, Nevada. In the postseason, UCLA defeated USC but lost to Arizona in the semifinals of the 2017 Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament in Paradise, Nevada. The Bruins were invited and participated in the 2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they defeated Kent State and Cincinnati in Sacramento, California but lost to Kentucky in Memphis, Tennessee in the Sweet Sixteen.\nChina incident.\nAt the start of the regular season, three of UCLA's players, Jalen Hill, Cody Riley, and LiAngelo Ball, were arrested in China for allegedly shoplifting before their game against Georgia Tech. The arrested players were confined to their hotel for several days until the charges were dropped and the players were allowed to leave the country.\nThe players involved were suspended indefinitely from the team after their return to campus, with LiAngelo eventually withdrawing from UCLA on December 4, 2017. He would go on to play professionally overseas in Lithuania with his younger brother LaMelo.\nOn December 22, 2017, UCLA announced that the other two suspended players, Riley and Hill, would remain suspended for the whole season, but would be allowed to rejoin practices and team activities on December 26.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\"| \n!colspan=12 style=\";\"| \n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The 2017–18 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Archie Miller, his first year as Indiana head coach. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The season officially kicked off with its annual event, Hoosier Hysteria, on October 21, 2017.\nFor Miller, his first season at IU wouldn't be so much of a rebuilding job, as it would be a major remodeling job; starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense, 25% offense. That scheme showed early and often, as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense, despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball (final ranking of number one in the Big Ten Conference). As the season progressed toward its end, the Hoosiers bought into Miller's defense, which led to better offense. With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten tournament to Rutgers, 67–76, and losing enough games to keep them out of the NCAA tournament and NIT, including an early few they should have won against Indiana State and IPFW, IU's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close. They finished with an overall record of 16–15 and 9–9 in the Big Ten.\nPrevious season.\nDespite the highs of the previous season and being ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation, the Hoosiers faced a troubling and disappointing year; they finished the 2016–17 season 18–16, 7–11 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for 10th place. At the Big Ten tournament they defeated Iowa in the second round to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Wisconsin. The Hoosiers missed out on the NCAA tournament and lost in the first round of the NIT, their first appearance since 2005, to Georgia Tech. The game was played at Georgia Tech's McCamish Pavilion because Indiana Athletic Director Fred Glass declined to host a home game at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall citing concern it would \"devalue\" the Hoosiers' home court.\nOn March 16, 2017, Indiana fired Crean after nine years as head coach. On March 25, 2017, it was announced that Dayton's Archie Miller was hired as Indiana's 29th head basketball coach. Miller played at NC State and had assistant coaching experience at schools like NC State, Ohio State, and Arizona before coaching Dayton for six years.\nPreseason.\nRecruiting class.\nWhen IU changed head coaches, each of the three original recruits had to be re-recruited by IU's new head coach, Archie Miller. Eventually, all three recruits who had been brought on board by former head coach, Tom Crean, recommitted. On July 16, 2017, Miller was able to land his first IU recruit in freshman Race Thompson. Announced in interviews, Thompson reclassified from the class of 2018 to 2017 and decided to redshirt his freshman year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big Ten tournament"

        "text": "The 2017–18 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Spartans, led by 23rd-year head coach Tom Izzo, played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference.\nWith a win over Illinois on February 20, 2018, the Spartans secured a share of the Big Ten title, their first regular season title since 2012. On February 25, the Spartans defeated Wisconsin to win the Big Ten title outright, their first outright regular season title since 2009. It marked the Spartans eighth regular season title under Izzo. The Spartans finished the season 30–5, 16–2 in Big Ten play to win the regular season championship. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they beat Wisconsin in the quarterfinals before losing to Michigan in the semifinals. The Spartans received a bid to the NCAA tournament, their 21st consecutive trip under Izzo, as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest region. They defeated No. 14 Bucknell in the first round before losing to No. 11-seeded Syracuse in the second round. As a result, the Spartans failed to make the Sweet Sixteen for the third consecutive year, a first for the Spartans with Izzo as head coach. The 16 Big Ten wins for the Spartans marked a school record and the 30 overall wins was only the fourth time in school history that the Spartans had won at least 30 games (all under Izzo).\nFollowing the season, Miles Bridges announced he would sign with an agent and declared for the NBA draft. A few days later, Jaren Jackson Jr. also announced he would enter the draft and sign with an agent.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2016–17 season 20–15, 10–8 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for fifth place. In the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Penn State in the second round before losing to Minnesota in the quarterfinals. They received a bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 9 seed in the Midwest region, their 20th consecutive appearance in the Tournament. They defeated No. 8-seeded Miami in the first round before losing to No. 1-seeded Kansas in the second round. The 15 losses by MSU were the second most ever under Tom Izzo, behind only his 16 losses in his first season as head coach at MSU.\nThe Spartans were led by freshmen Miles Bridges, 16.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, and Nick Ward, 13.9 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.\nOffseason.\nRecruiting class.\n2017 recruiting class.\nOn September 15, 2016, five-star forward Jaren Jackson Jr. announced that he would attend Michigan State. He is the son of former NBA player Jaren Jackson Sr. Jackson was listed as the eighth best player in the 2017 final rankings by ESPN. On September 30, 2016, four-star power forward Xavier Tillman committed to MSU. He was considered the best player in the state of Michigan in the 2017 class. Tillman was ranked No. 71 in the 2017 final rankings by ESPN. Tillman and Jackson signed National Letters of Intent on November 9, 2016. With just these two signings, MSU's class was listed as the 14th best in the country by ESPN and 17th by rivals.com.\nTwo-star point guard Jack Hoiberg, son of Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg, announced he would attend Michigan State as a preferred walk-on. On May 30, the school announced that two-star shooting guard Brock Washington would join the Spartans as a preferred walk-on in 2017. \nEarly offseason rankings.\nIn April, 2017, most early pollsters included Michigan State in the preseason top 25 for the 2017–18 season. These included ESPN (No. 12), \"Sports Illustrated\" (No. 8), Yahoo! Sports (No. 11), \"USA Today\" (No. 16), NBC Sports (No. 3), CBS Sports (No. 3), \"Sporting News\" (No. 5) and Bleacher Report (No. 12). Most of the projections assumed Miles Bridges would not return to East Lansing for his sophomore season. \"USA Today\" noted that \"leading scorer Miles Bridges is NBA-bound.\" The \"Sporting News\" summarized: \"Bridges hasn’t announced his decision yet, but Spartans fans aren’t holding their breath (he’s expected to be a lottery pick).\" Following the deadline to withdraw from the NBA draft, many media outlets released updated early top 25 rankings for the 2017–18 season. MSU was a consensus top three team by every major outlet: NBC Sports (No. 1), Fox Sports (No. 2), \"Sporting News\" (No. 2), ESPN (No. 3), CBS Sports (No. 3), and Yahoo! Sports (No. 3).\nReturning players.\nOn April 13, 2017, Miles Bridges, considered an NBA lottery pick, announced he would not enter the NBA draft and would return to MSU as a sophomore. His return led many to project MSU as a Final Four contender for the 2017–18 season. Losing only seniors Eron Harris and Alvin Ellis III, the Spartans returned eight of their top 10 players from the prior season. Bridges was also considered a potential candidate for National Player of the Year upon the announcement of his return to Michigan State. The Spartans returned 78% of their scoring and 81% of their rebounding from the previous year.\nOn May 8, redshirt graduate student Ben Carter was granted a sixth year of eligibility after the NCAA granted his medical hardship waiver. The Spartans had one remaining open scholarship for the 2017–18 season after Carter was granted eligibility. After missing out on late recruiting targets (Brian Bowen, Mark Smith, and Brandon McCoy), the Spartans had one remaining open scholarship. It was confirmed on August 24, 2017, that the last remaining scholarship would be given to former walk-on Connor George, son of Cathy George, MSU's volleyball coach at the time.\nTransfers.\nOn May 11, 6-foot-11, 220-pound center Braden Burke announced he would transfer to Michigan State from Robert Morris and be a preferred walk-on. Burke will have to sit out the 2017–18 season due to NCAA transfer rules.\nPreseason.\nOn the first day of practice, September 29, 2017, Tom Izzo announced that Lourawls \"Tum Tum\" Nairn and Miles Bridges had been selected as captains for the team.\nOn October 20, MSU held its annual Midnight Madness event at Breslin Center. Tom Izzo did not dress up for the event as he had in the past, but there was a man in a black suit, green tie and extra-large head on his shoulders that was supposed to resemble Izzo. Earlier in the day, the school unveiled the $20 million Tom Izzo Hall of History inside the Breslin Center.\nJud Heathcote's death.\nOn August 28, former MSU head coach Jud Heathcote, who led the Spartans to their first National Championship in 1979, died at the age of 90. \"Michigan State has lost one of its icons today,\" Tom Izzo said in a statement. \"And yet, nothing can erase his impact on the program, the players he coached and the coaches he mentored. Spartan basketball is what it is today because of Jud Heathcote.\" On September 6, 2017, Michigan State announced that it would wear a memorial patch on their uniforms during the season for former head coach Jud Heathcote who died in late August. The team also announced that the February 10, 2018 game against Purdue would be a tribute game to Heathcote.\nPreseason rankings.\nIn its preseason college preview, Lindy's Sports ranked the Spartans No. 1 in the country. The publication picked Miles Bridges as Big Ten Player of the Year and the top small forward in the country. Nick Ward was named preseason second team All-Big Ten center while Jaren Jackson Jr. was named newcomer of the year.\nThe Blue Ribbon Yearbook ranked MSU No. 2 in its preseason rankings. The publication listed Miles Bridges as a second team All-American. Athlon Sports ranked the Spartans No. 2 in the country while ranking Bridges as the No. 1 player in the country. Ward and Jackson were selected as second team All-Big Ten and Jackson was named Big Ten newcomer of the year.\nStreet &amp; Smith ranked MSU No. 3 in the country while naming Bridges first-team All-American. On September 26, NBC Sports named Miles Bridges the national preseason player of the year. On October 23, ESPN.com also named Bridges the national preseason player of the year. On November 6, Bridges was named an AP preseason All-American, receiving 61 of the possible 65 votes.\nPreseason Big Ten poll.\nPrior to the conference's annual media day, awards and a poll were chosen by a panel of 28 writers, two for each team in the conference. Michigan State was a unanimous selection to win the conference. The Spartans' Miles Bridges was also a unanimous selection for Preseason Player of the Year.\nAt the Big Ten media day, the Spartans were unanimous selections to win the conference. Miles Bridges was named the Preseason Player of the Year. Nick Ward joined Bridges on the preseason All-Big Ten team.\nExhibitions.\nOn October 23, 2017, it was announced that MSU would play Georgia in Grand Rapids, Michigan on October 29 in a charity exhibition game to help raise funds for hurricane relief.\nIn the first exhibition game for the Spartans, MSU defeated Ferris State 80–72 on October 26. Miles Bridges left the game in the first half after falling and cutting his head, but returned in the second half. Cassius Winston led the Spartans in scoring with 24 points as MSU avoided the upset from the Division II Bulldogs. Freshman Jaren Jackson Jr. had 14 points, eight rebounds, and eight blocks in his MSU debut.\nOn October 29, MSU took on Georgia in a hastily planned charity exhibition game in Grand Rapids to benefit hurricane victims. With four stitches over his right eye from the cut suffered in the first exhibition game, Bridges led the Spartans with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Nick Ward had 13 points while Joshua Langford scored 11 as the Spartans won 80–68.\nOn November 1, it was announced that junior forward Kyle Ahrens would be out indefinitely after aggravating an injury to his right foot.\nThe newly ranked No. 2 Spartans (in AP and Coaches poll) took on Division II Hillsdale on November 3 in their final exhibition game.

Each Spartan starter scored in double figures: Nick Ward (16), Cassius Winston (12), and Joshua Langford (13). Ward made all six of his shots as the team shot 78% from the free throw line in the easy win.\nDuke.\nIn a matchup of No. 1 versus No. 2 at the Champions Classic in Chicago on November 14, the Spartans struggled with Duke's 2–3 zone. Bridges, Jackson Jr., and Ward each scored 19 points for the Spartans who shot 50% from the field in the game. However, Duke's Grayson Allen scored 37 points and MSU lost the rebound battle and allowed 25 offensive rebounds as they fell 88–81.

In the second half, the Spartans were unable to pull away though they had the lead for most of the half as both teams struggled offensively. Miles Bridges scored 21 points while Jackson Jr. tied a single-game Spartan record with eight blocks, but MSU still needed two big three-pointers later in the game by Cassius Winston to pull out the 10-point victory, 62–52. MSU limited Rutgers to 25% shooting on the night, but only made 38% of their own shots while failing to win the rebound battle as both teams had 45 rebounds. Nick Ward, who struggled in the first half, only played a minute and a half in the second half and sat on the bench dejectedly for most of the half. Izzo said he just had a bad game. The win was the Spartans seventh in a row and left the Spartans at 8–1 on the season and 2–0 in Big Ten play.\nRemaining non-conference games.\nSouthern Utah.\nThe Spartans returned home to play Southern Utah on December 9.

The win, MSU's eighth in a row, moved the Spartans to 9–1 on the season.\nFollowing losses by No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kansas, it was likely MSU would become the No. 1 team in the country on December 11. However, Villanova was named the No. 1 team in the country in both polls, leapfrogging MSU.\nOakland.\nOn December 16, the Spartans participated in the Hitachi College Basketball Showcase held at the new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit and took on Oakland. MSU took the early lead in the game, led by Nick Ward who scored 15 points and brought down 15 rebounds in the game. The Spartans continued their strong defensive effort, holding the Grizzlies to 31.3% shooting in the first half. Despite this, MSU only led by five at the half.

Houston would finish the game at 28.4% in the game as the Spartans kept up their nation-leading field goal defense. MSU blew out the Huskies 107–62, the most points the Spartans had scored since 2011, moving to 11–1 on the season. Despite the easy win, Izzo was disappointed with the Spartans' performance, especially with the fact that HBU out-rebounded MSU on the offensive glass 24–10.\nLong Beach State.\nOn December 21, Long Beach State had no better luck against the Spartans in East Lansing. Miles Bridges scored 17 points and had nine rebounds while Josh Langford also scored 17.

The win moved the Spartans to 13–1 on the season with one non-conference game remaining.\nSavannah State.\nOn New Year's Eve, Savannah State traveled to East Lansing for the Spartans final non-conference game of the season. MSU jumped to an early lead as Savannah State, number one in the country in three-point attempts, struggled early. However, the Tigers got hot near the midpoint of the first half and kept the score close. The Spartans turned the ball over 10 times in the first ten minutes of the game, but were still able to lead by 13 at half time, 51–38. MSU turned it on in the second half, outscoring the Tigers 57–14, including a 32–0 stretch to close the game and win 108–52. The Spartans scored over 100 points for the fourth game in a row, the longest streak in school history.

On January 2, MSU was also named number one in the weekly coaches' poll.\nRemaining conference games.\nMaryland.\nOn January 4, the Spartans welcomed Maryland to East Lansing as conference play resumed. Maryland started well, shooting over 60% from the field in the first 10 minutes of the game. MSU, however, used a 15–0 run near the end of the first half to take a 13-point lead at the half. MSU continued its strong play in the second half, routing the Terrapins 91–61. The Spartans made 16 of 28 three-point attempts while also hitting on 16 of 28 two-point shots. Jaren Jackson Jr. hit five threes, while Kenny Goins made his first career three-point basket, hitting a second three-pointer a few minutes later.

MSU remained in first place in the Big Ten with a 3–0 record, moving to 15–1 overall.\nOhio State.\nMSU took to the road for only the second time on the season, traveling to face Ohio State on January 7. MSU started well, taking an 11–4 lead before Ohio State battled back. A close game for most of the first half, the Buckeyes took a 12-point lead to the half behind some good shooting and a buzzer-beating three as the half ended. MSU failed to respond in the second half as the Buckeyes continued their run, pushing the lead to as many as 23. MSU, shooting over 50% on the season, shot only 39% from the field in the game while OSU shot over 52% in the 80–64 blowout. Nick Ward only attempted one shot for the Spartans and settled for three points in the game. Miles Bridges had 17, but did not shoot well, making only seven of 19 shots. Josh Langford added 17 as well, but it was not enough for the Spartans who turned the ball over 12 times. After assisting on 30 of 32 baskets against Maryland, the Spartans only had 13 assists on 23 made baskets in the loss. The loss dropped the Spartans out of first place in the Big Ten and dropped them from the No. 1 ranking in the country as they fell to 15–2, 3–1 overall.\nRutgers.\nOn January 10, MSU looked to return to their winning ways with Rutgers traveling to the Breslin Center. The Spartans started well, taking an early lead, but Rutgers fought back, staying within seven at the half. Miles Bridges struggled on the night, especially in the first half as he failed to score. In the second half, MSU had several long scoreless streaks which allowed the Knights to tie the game and even take the lead near the end of the half. With just over eight second remaining in the game and the Spartans trailing by one point, Bridges was fouled, but only made one of the two free throws to tie the game. On the ensuing play, Rutgers missed a game-winning shot to force overtime. In the first overtime game of the season for the Spartans, Josh Langford hit a big three-pointer to give the Spartans the lead and Cassius Winston hit six free throws down the stretch to seal the 76–72 win for the Spartans. The disappointing performance by the Spartans after getting blown out in the previous game was also the closest game of the season for the Spartans. Nick Ward led the Spartans with 17 and Bridges rebounded to score 11. The win moved the Spartans to 4–1 in conference play and 16–2 overall.\nMichigan.\nThe Spartans next welcomed rival Michigan to the Breslin Center on January 13. MSU played well in the first half, but Michigan kept the score close. In the second half, Michigan's defense continued to dominate MSU and Michigan answered every run by the Spartans. Though MSU shot a better percentage than the Wolverines, Michigan took 11 more shots, thanks in large part to MSU's 18 turnovers in the game. Nick Ward had a disappointing game, only scoring four points in 14 minutes while Cassius Winston only had two assists to go along with four turnovers. Michigan pulled away for the 82–72 win, marking MSU's second loss in the previous three games. Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson Jr. each had 19 to lead the Spartans, but it was not enough as Michigan big man Moritz Wagner scored 27. The loss dropped MSU to 4–2 in conference and two games behind conference leaders, Purdue and Ohio State.\nIndiana.\nAfter a week off, the Spartans returned to play on January 19 against Indiana in East Lansing. The Spartans appeared to return to form as they dominated the Hoosiers for much of the game, leading by 19 at the half and by as many as 30 in the second half. Miles Bridges led all scorers with 22 while Nick Ward added 18 points and 13 rebounds in the win. Jaren Jackson Jr. added three blocks which tied the MSU single-season record for blocks by freshman.

However, MSU shot 15 of 19 from the field in the first half, led by Miles Bridges 17 points in the half to take a 39–32 halftime lead. MSU took control of the game in the second half as Jaren Jackson Jr. scored a career-high 21 with 11 rebounds and six blocks to lead the Spartans to an 18-point lead. Turnovers again became a problem late in the second half as the Illini narrowed the lead to eight, but Jackson and Bridges hit 10 straight free throws down the stretch to allow the Spartans to escape with an 87–74 win. The Spartans shot 68.2% from the field in the game, the best shooting percentage of any opponent at the State Farm Center. MSU dominated the boards, out-rebounding Illinois 37–15 in the win and Bridges finished with 31 points. Jackson's six blocks moved him within one for the MSU single-season record. The Spartans turned the ball over 25 times, led by Cassius Winston's eight, the most for a Spartan team since 2005. The win moved the Spartans to 18–3, 6–2 in Big Ten play on the season.\nWisconsin.\nThe Spartans returned home to face the Wisconsin on January 26. Prior to the game, reports surfaced that Tom Izzo's program had several sexual assault allegations over the prior ten years, though Izzo was never accused of wrongdoing. MSU Athletic Director Mark Hollis also resigned early in the day. Due to this and the Larry Nassar sexual assault scandal, the Izzone wore teal shirts to show support for survivors of sexual assault. The Spartans started well, leading by as many as 18 in the first half with a 37–21 half time lead. Wisconsin brought the game to within six in the second half, but MSU was able to control the game. Miles Bridges led all scorers with 24 and Wisconsin's Ian Happ scored 22 of this 23 points in the second half to prevent the game from turning into a rout. The Spartans cruised to a 76–61 win, moving to 19–3, 7–2 in Big Ten play on the season. After the game, Izzo did not comment much on the sexual assault allegations, but stated that he was not planning on retiring and that he wanted be part of the healing process.\nMaryland.\nReturning to the road less than 48 hours later, the Spartans traveled to face Maryland. MSU did not lead in the first half as Maryland was able to keep a lead throughout and pushed the lead to 13 at halftime. The Spartans answered to start the second half, taking the lead and leading by as many as eight. Josh Langford scored 19 for the Spartans as Nick Ward (seven points) and Miles Bridges (11 points) each struggled. Cassius Winston overcame a rough start to score 13 as the Spartans cut down their turnovers, committing only 10. MSU held on for the 74–68 win, sweeping Maryland on the season to move to 20–3 and 8–2 on the season. Izzo was again questioned after the game regarding sexual assault reports, but again refused to say much.\nPenn State.\nThe Spartans returned home to face Penn State on January 31. MSU again struggled in the first half, scoring only 24 points for the second consecutive game and shooting only 37% from the field. As a result, they trailed by six at the half. The Nittany Lions pushed the lead to 12 early in the second half as it appeared the distractions surrounding the program were causing issues. However, MSU outscored Penn State 41–14 from there to win 76–68. Miles Bridges scored 23 while Cassius Winston scored 15 and had 10 assists. The Spartans continued their nation-leading defensive play holding PSU to 37% from the field in the game while MSU finished at 50%. The Spartans did turn the ball over 16 times with most coming in the first half as they trailed throughout the half. The win moved MSU to 21–3, 9–2 on the season. The win also moved Tom Izzo into a second-place tie with Gene Keady for most Big Ten wins.\nIndiana.\nMSU finished the season with five of their last seven games on the road, starting with a trip to Indiana on February 3. The Spartans avoided another slow start and took an early lead against the Hoosiers in Bloomington. MSU held Indiana to only 28% shooting from the field and led by as many as 11 in the first half and led by eight at halftime. In the second half, the Spartans held their lead at about 10 for most of the game. Matt McQuaid scored 12 to lead MSU on four of five shooting from behind the arc to help secure the 63–60 win. Tom Izzo was disappointed in the team's performance as the Spartans were outrebounded by 24 including a 25–3 deficit on the offensive boards. MSU shot only 41% from the free throw line which allowed Indiana to pull the game within three and, after Cassius Winston missed two free throws with seconds remaining, allowed the Hoosiers to get a last-second heave to attempt to tie the game. The win moved the Spartans to 22–3, 10–2 on the season. The 22–3 start for the Spartans marked the best start for MSU since 2001. The win also marked Izzo's 266th Big Ten win, moving him in to sole possession of second place in Big Ten wins, trailing only Bob Knight.\nIowa.\nMSU traveled to face Iowa on February 6, marking their fifth game in 12 days. MSU started well, taking an early lead, but foul trouble for Nick Ward and Jaren Jackson Jr. limited their effectiveness in the first half as they sat out for more than 10 minutes. MSU, despite not playing great defense, took the halftime lead 48–42. Iowa closed the lead early in the second half and led by as many as eight before MSU narrowed the lead. Ward, who scored 17 points in only 12 minutes, missed much of the half with four fouls and Cassius Winston also sat for eight minutes due to poor play. Kenny Goins hit a three-pointer with just over two minutes remaining to give MSU a 90–89 lead. However, Iowa retook the lead before Miles Bridges hit two free throws with over a minute remaining to give MSU the lead. Josh Langford made two free throws to extend the lead to 96–93 with six seconds remaining and Bridges stole the ensuing Iowa pass before being fouled. Needing only one free throw to seal the game, Bridges missed both and Iowa's Nicholas Baer missed a half-court heave to tie it as the Spartans pulled out the 96–93 win. Bridges led the Spartans with 25 points and Langford added 15 while Winston scored nine points and had eight assists. Tom Izzo was disappointed in his team's defense but happy with the win in the rough stretch of the schedule. The win moved the Spartans to 23–3 and 11–2 in Big Ten play.\nPurdue.\nMSU welcomed Big Ten co-leader Purdue to the Breslin Center on February 10 for a Jud Heathcote tribute game. The Boilermakers, having lost to Ohio State earlier in the week and dropping into a tie with the Buckeyes in the Big Ten, started out well, leading by as many as 10 in the first half as big man Isaac Haas seemingly scored at will against the Spartans. MSU chose not to double Haas throughout the game, choosing to try to limit Purdue's three-point shooting. At halftime, however, the Spartans trailed 36–31. In the second half, MSU settled on Gavin Schilling to guard Haas who still scored a game-high 25 points. However, Purdue, who had shot 42% in the first half, shot only 37% in the second and made zero three-pointers. MSU was able to tighten the score and take the lead, but still trailed by two when Kenny Goins hit a jumper to tie the game at 65 with 49 seconds remaining. Haas, with Schilling guarding him, missed a shot on the ensuing possession and MSU called timeout with 20 seconds remaining. Miles Bridges, who scored 20 in the game, took the ball and hit a three-pointer over Dakota Mathias to give MSU the 68–65 lead with seven seconds remaining. A foul on the in bounds play and a missed free throw by Vince Edwards sealed the win for the Spartans. The 68–65 win moved MSU to 24–3, 12–2 in Big Ten play and into a tie for second with Purdue, still one game behind conference-leading Ohio State. At halftime of the game, Steve Smith and other former MSU players paid tribute to former head coach Jud Heathcote and former Purdue coach Gene Keady paid his respects as well.\nOn February 11, the Spartans, somewhat surprisingly, were give only a number three seed in an early NCAA Tournament preview of the top 16 seeds. Purdue, having just lost two games, was still named a number one seed.\nOn February 12, Michigan State was ranked number one in the Coaches Poll, receiving 17 of 32 first place votes. They were ranked number two in the AP poll, receiving 21 of 65 first place votes.\nMinnesota.\nThe Spartans traveled to Minneapolis to face Minnesota with four games remaining in the regular season looking to avoid a letdown after beating Purdue in the prior game. The Spartans started the game off hot, shooting lights out from three as they made their first six three-pointers (three by Winston, two by Jackson Jr. and one by Bridges) to jump out to an 18–6 lead. MSU continued to shoot well from three, making 10 of 12 three-pointers in the first half to lead 43–25 in the first half. Jackson led the Spartans with a career-high 27 points while Ward, who struggled in the first half, scored 11 of his 13 points in the second half. MSU dominated the glass against the overmatched Gophers, outrebounding them 49–22. Minnesota shot only 32% from the field as MSU shot over 53%, including 63%, from three in the 87–57 rout of the Gophers. The win moved MSU to 25–3 overall, the school's best-ever start, as they moved to 13–2 in conference play.\nNorthwestern.\nWith three games remaining in the season, MSU traveled to play Northwestern at Allstate Arena on February 17. Following losses by Purdue and Ohio State earlier in the week, MSU entered the game with a chance to move into a first place tie with Ohio State with a win. However, the Spartans fell behind early as Northwestern shot 60% from the field in the first half and led by as many as 27 in the half. Michigan State trailed by 22 at the half as it looked like they would fail to take first place. However, MSU held Northwestern to 11 points in the second half as they surged back to tie the game behind Winston's 17 points, including five three-pointers. Jackson's three-point play with 5:36 remaining in the game gave the Spartans their first lead of the game at 56–53. Four made free throws by Miles Bridges with less than a minute remaining sealed the 65–60 win in front of a largely pro-Michigan State crowd. Northwestern made only three of their 26 field goals in the second half, shooting less than 12% in the half. The 27-point comeback win was the largest comeback win in Big Ten history and, at the time, the fifth largest all-time in Division I history. The win moved MSU to 26–3 on the season and 14–2 in conference play. The win and an Ohio State loss the following day put the Spartans in first place by themselves with only two games remaining in the regular season.\nIllinois.\nThe Spartans returned home for Senior Night against Illinois on February 20 with a chance to clinch at least a share of the Big Ten title for the first time since 2012. Because it was senior night, seniors Ben Carter, Lourawls \"Tum Tum\" Nairn Jr., and Gavin Schilling started the game for the Spartans, only the third different starting lineup on the season. MSU started slow, but took a three-point lead at the half against the Illini who made six three-pointers in the first half. However, in the second half, the Spartans took control, pushing the lead to more than 20 in the easy win. Bridges led the Spartans with 19 points on what was his last game at the Breslin Center. Jackson, also in his last game in East Lansing, scored eight and had five blocks in only 18 minutes. Langford added 16 points while Winston added 12 in the 81–61 win. The win moved the Spartans to 27–3, 15–2 on the season and gave them at least a share of the Big Ten title with one game remaining against Wisconsin. After the game, the Spartans were happy with the title as they raised a championship banner, but stated they wanted to do more on the season.\nWisconsin.\nLooking to win the Big Ten title outright, the Spartans traveled to Wisconsin on February 25 for the final regular season game. Prior to the game, reports surfaced that Miles Bridges had been paid to attend Michigan State, among other allegations. MSU conducted an investigation and presented their findings to the NCAA, who cleared Bridges, ruling him eligible to play against the Badgers. The Spartans started off well, taking an early lead, but Wisconsin shot the ball well in the first half. Despite this, the Spartans did not trail until midway through the second half. Cassius Winston went six for six from three, scoring 20 points to lead the Spartans to the 68–63 win. Nick Ward added 14 points while Bridges added 10 as MSU held Wisconsin to 37% shooting. The win moved the Spartans to 16–2 in the Big Ten, marking the most conference wins in school history as the Spartans clinched the Big Ten title outright for the first time since 2009. The Spartans also moved to 28–3 on the season, the most regular season wins in school history.\nPostseason.\nBig Ten tournament.\nWisconsin.\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament held at Madison Square Garden, MSU faced Wisconsin in the quarterfinals on March 2 following the Badgers' win over Maryland the day before. In the second meeting between the two teams in five days, the Spartans took the early lead and led the majority of the first half, but, as in their last meeting, the Badgers kept the game close. A 32–28 halftime lead for the Spartans preceded a second half where the lead shifted back and forth. Miles Bridges scored 20 for the Spartans while Cassius Winston added 17. With 20 seconds remaining in the game and the Spartans leading by three, the Badgers could not get off a good shot as the Spartan defense limited them to a long three-point attempt which fell short. The 63–60 win, the Spartans eighth straight year with at least a win in the Big Ten tournament, moved the Spartans to the semifinals to face Michigan.\nMichigan.\nOn March 3, the Spartans faced their rivals, Michigan, looking to avenge an early season loss at the Breslin Center. The Wolverines started well, taking an early eight point lead in the first half. However, MSU fought back and took a three-point lead at the half. Miles Bridges scored 17 for the Spartans, including showing a strong post presence, but it was not enough as MSU could not overcome Michigan's defense. Michigan limited MSU to 38% shooting including only 28% from three. The Wolverines beat the Spartans for the second time on the season and ended any real chance for the Spartans to receive a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The loss ended MSU's 13-game winning streak.\nNCAA Tournament.\nDue to the Big Ten tournament being held a week early, the Spartans had to wait for more than a week before NCAA Tournament pairings were announced and at least 13 days before their next game. For the 21st consecutive year, Michigan State received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. As the No. 3 seed in the Midwest region, the Spartans learned they would face Bucknell at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on March 16. The Spartans previously played at Little Caesars Arena in December when they defeated Oakland.\nBucknell.\nOn March 16, the Spartans took on Bucknell in Detroit. MSU took an early lead in the first half, but were unable to put Bucknell away. MSU did lead 44–40 at the half and extended the lead in the second half, leading by as many as 16 as Miles Bridges took control of the game. Bridges scored 29 to lead all scorers while Josh Langford added 22. Bucknell scored 15 points on five three-pointers with less than 90 seconds remaining, including one at the buzzer, to narrow the margin to a four-point victory at 82–78. Xavier Tillman was the only non-starter to score for MSU.\nSyracuse.\nIn the second round, MSU took on No. 11-seeded Syracuse and their zone two days later. After scoring 44 points in the first half of the previous game, the Spartans managed only 25 points in the first half as they struggled to deal with the Syracuse zone. Despite their struggles, the Orange were unable to take the lead until just over four minutes remained in the game. MSU attempted a season-high 37 three-pointers, making only eight of them as they struggled to find shots. Bridges went 4–18 from the field, while Cassius Winston went 4–12 and Langford went 1–12. As a result, MSU fell to the Orange to end their season 55–53. Following the game, Bridges, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Nick Ward declined to address the possibility of them going to the NBA.\nRoster.\n \nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018 Big Ten tournament was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Due to the Big East's use of that venue for their conference tournament, the Big Ten tournament took place one week earlier than usual, ending the week before Selection Sunday. This resulted in teams having nearly two weeks off before the NCAA tournament. As a result, it the Big Ten regular season will begin in early Dec. A previously scheduled road game against Florida was moved to the 2018–19 season due to scheduling conflicts.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\nSource\nPlayer statistics.\nSource\nRankings.\n^Coaches Poll did not release a Week 2 poll at the same time AP did.&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Swimming Canada is the Canadian national governing body for competitive swimming in the country. It was established in 1909, as the Canadian Amateur Swimming Association.\nSwimming Canada oversees the management of all swim programs throughout the nation and provides the foundation for beginner-level athletes to train towards the elite level, with the chance to attend world championships and the Olympic Games. The national headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario, with staff dispersed throughout Canada.\nHistory.\nThe Canadian Amateur Swimming Association was established in 1909, after the preliminary appearance of a Canadian swimmer at the London 1908 Summer Olympics. Robert Zimmerman of Montreal was the first Canadian Swimmer to appear at any Olympic Games, competing in the 100m freestyle, 100m backstroke, and springboard Diving.\nAt the 1912 Summer Olympics, George Hodgson won Canada's first two Olympic swimming medals and set a world record in the 1500 meter freestyle. Elaine Tanner became the first Canadian to win three swimming medals at the Mexico 1968 Summer Olympics. In the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics, Canadian swimmers accounted for eight of the total 11 medals won by Team Canada.\nThe Canadian Olympic team has brought swimmers to each Olympic Games, except for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, due to a government boycott. Over the past 100 years, Canadian swimmers have earned over 40 medals at the Olympic games, as well as many other successes through World Championship competitions.\nIn the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics, the Canadian women's swim team earned six out of the 22 medals that Team Canada won during the Games. Four of the six medals were earned by 16 year-old Penny Oleksiak, the only Canadian to win four medals in a single Olympic Games.\nMeets.\nSwimming Canada works with local club teams, university teams and national select teams, as well as community members to make annual events possible.\nTeam Canada.\nThe national team as well as the junior national team is selected every year at Swimming Canada's Trials competition, and every four years those members form the Olympic team. Swimmers who win the meet and are able to achieve qualifying times set by FINA are then selected for the national team.\nCircle of Excellence.\nSince 2001 Swimming Canada has honoured \"the greatest Canadian swimmers of all time\", and some coaches and builders, by induction into its Circle of Excellence."

        "text": "The EuroLeague historical league formats are the different league formats over the years, of the top-tier level European-wide men's professional club basketball league, the EuroLeague.\nEuroLeague historical formats.\nStarting with the EuroLeague 2009–10 season, the EuroLeague's first phase was the Qualifying Rounds, which involved eight clubs bracketed into a knockout tournament consisting of two-legged matches. The four survivors of the first qualifying round were paired against one another for the second qualifying round, with the two winners playing for the last spot in the EuroLeague Regular Season. All losing clubs in the qualifying rounds parachuted down into Euroleague Basketball's second-tier level competition, the EuroCup.\nThe next phase of the old format was the Regular Season, in which 24 teams participated; from the 2009–10 season to the 2015–16 season, the participants included 23 or 24 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season, depending on if there was a Qualifying Round winner. Each team played two games (home-and-away) against every other team in its group. At the end of the Regular Season, the field was cut from 24 teams to 16 teams. Before the 2008–09 season, the teams were divided into three groups of eight teams each, with the top five teams in each group, plus the top sixth-place finisher advancing. After that, the Regular Season involved four groups with six teams each, with the first four teams in each group advancing. From the 2013–14 to 2015–16 seasons, the eight eliminated teams in this stage were dropped down to the 2nd-tier level EuroCup.\nUnder this format, the second phase, known as the Top 16, then began, featuring the 16 survivors of the Regular Season, drawn into eight-team groups. As in the Regular Season, each Top 16 group was contested in a double round-robin format.\nThe third phase under that format, the Quarterfinal round, was played from the 2004–05 season to the 2015–16 season. Before that, only the group winners advanced to the EuroLeague Final Four (see below). From the 2004–05 season to the 2015–16 season, the first- and second-place teams from each group advanced. In the quarterfinal round, the first-place team from each group was matched against a second-place team from another group, in a playoff series. Through the 2007–08 season, the playoff series were held in a best-of-three format, and expanded to a best-of-five format for the 2008–09 season. Home court advantage in the series went each one of the first-place teams from the previous stage.\nUnder these formats, the EuroLeague Final Four, held at a predetermined site, featured the winners of the four quarterfinal series in one-off knockout matches. The semifinal losers played for third place; and the winners played for the EuroLeague championship.\nThe 2010 EuroLeague Final Four was held on 7 and 9 May, at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, France. The 2011 EuroLeague Final Four was held at Palau Sant Jordi, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.\nFor the 2012–13 Euroleague season, the Top 16 was changed from four groups of four teams, to two groups of eight teams. The four best teams in each group then qualified to the league's quarterfinals playoffs round.\nQualifications.\nOver the years, the EuroLeague usually, but not always, has included national domestic league champions from the leading European club basketball countries. Depending on the country, places in the EuroLeague may have been awarded the years on the basis of:\nFor example, two 2007–08 season national domestic league champions from ULEB member countries did not compete in the 2008–09 Euroleague — Zadar (Croatia) and Hapoel Holon (Israel). Zadar instead played in the European second-level EuroCup in the 2008–09 season. Hapoel Holon, however, did not compete in \"any\" of the three European-wide continental club competitions — not even in the then third-tier level EuroChallenge (which was run by FIBA Europe, instead of Euroleague Basketball) — because of financial difficulties.\nStarting with the 2009–10 season, and through the 2015–16 season, the entrance criteria to the EuroLeague changed:"

The Jayhawks, were members of the Big 12 Conference and played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 15th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self.\nOn October 22, the Jayhawks renewed their rivalry against Missouri in an exhibition game for charity. The proceeds of the game went to four different charities for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria relief funds. It was the first time the teams played since Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC.\nThe Jayhawks entered the season ranked 4th, their 162nd consecutive poll they have been ranked in. During the season, they extended the streak to, as of the poll released on March 12, 2018, 180 consecutive polls. The last game KU played as unranked team was a 66–61 win over Colorado on January 31, 2009. With their 74–72 win over Texas Tech on February 24, 2018, the Jayhawks clinched their NCAA record 14th consecutive Big 12 regular season championship. The season marked the first time the Jayhawks have ever been swept in the regular season by an opponent under Bill Self, ending what was a streak of 103 home and home series without a sweep dating back to 2001. The Jayhawks lost to Self's alma mater Oklahoma State twice. With 3:49 left in the 2nd half of their Big 12 Tournament Quarterfinal game against Oklahoma State, red-shirt sophomore guard Malik Newman made a 3-point shot. That 3 point was the Jayhawks school record 319th made 3 point shot in the season, breaking a record the Jayhawks set the previous season.\nThey received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region. There they defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to advance to the Final Four. In the Final Four, they lost to No. 1 seed from the East region and eventual National Champions, Villanova.\nSenior guard Devonte' Graham was named a Consensus First Team All-American. He was the 23rd different player to be named a Consensus First Team All-American and the 30th overall selection in Kansas history. It was also the 2nd consecutive year Kansas had a Consensus First Team All-American.\nIn 2023, 15 of the Jayhawks wins, their regular season Conference Championship, their Big 12 Tournament Championship, their tournament appearance, and Final Four appearance, were all vacated for recruiting violations. Specifically games Silvio De Sousa played in were vacated; the first game he played was the home victory over Kansas State. The vacated NCAA Tournament appearance caused their NCAA record of consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances to end at 28 with their 2017 appearance being the final official appearance in the streak.\nRoster and coaching staff changes.\nCoaching staff changes.\nThe Jayhawks did not experience any changes to their coaching staff.\nEarly draft entrants.\nDid not initially hire agent.\nStarting with the 2016 NBA draft, if a player declares for the draft, but does not hire an agent, it allows the player to return to their school even after participating in the NBA Draft Combine, as long as they withdraw from the draft no later than 10 days after the end of the combine. For the 2017 draft, the final withdrawal date to retain NCAA eligibility was May 24.\nNCAA Corruption scandal, FBI Probe.\nOn February 23, 2018, Kansas was announced as one of 27 schools that had players being investigated by the FBI's probe into corruption in college basketball which began with an investigation of Louisville and their former head coach Rick Pitino. Kansas' involvement was specifically a former player being named in Christian Dawkins' expense reports for seeking thousands of dollars of reimbursements for expenses incurred from recruits’ families. Former player Josh Jackson's mother reportedly received a $2,700 payment, which was listed in the report. Also named in the report were fellow Kansas Division I team Wichita State, Big 12 members Iowa State and Texas, as well as perennial power house programs Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Michigan State.\nSchedule and results.\nAll wins beginning with the home game against Kansas State are officially vacated.

        "text": "I-formation is a doubles tennis strategy carefully planned to confuse the opponent returning the serve. \"The name comes from its resemblance to American football's I formation, in which the fullback positions right behind the halfback, who positions right behind the quarterback.\"\n\"The net player on the serving team crouches down (so they do not get hit by the serve) on the centre service line. The server hits the serve from directly behind her on the baseline\". The net player then indicates (privately), typically with their hands behind their back, which side of the court they will move to as the return of serve is hit. These hand gestures let the server at the baseline know which side of the court they are to serve to, and then move to. For intermediate players, such as league or club players, it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained. Advanced competitors, such as professional and tour players, are known to use other combinations (for example, Australian doubles) which deliberately expose one side of the court to entice the return of serve to be hit into the open space.\nThe ultimate aim is for the net player to cut off the return of serve, hopefully ending the point.\nWhy I-formation is effective.\nIn doubles tennis, it is beneficial to keep the ball away from the opposition net player, because it is easy to hit a point-winning shot from closer to the net than any other position on the court.\nThis tactic has the player returning the serve guess which side the opponents net player will be on. Therefore, there is a 50–50 chance that the person returning the serve is going to hit the ball right into the opposing net player, which can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles."

It was released on Android by Playdigious on May 9, 2017.\nGameplay.\nThe player plays the game by dragging the ball back to make a shot. If the player drags back for longer the player's shot more powerful. The game is level based with various courses, each with nine holes each.\nReception.\n\"OK Golf\" received mixed reviews. Gamezebo gave the game a rating of 3 out of 5 stars praising the game's \"strong 3D graphics that allow you a clear picture of the hole and its topography\" and that it \"plays enough like mini-golf to appeal to a general audience\" while criticizing the game's \"lack of ability to choose your own club will likely infuriate golf fans\", the \"manipulation of the gameplay surface can be quite sticky (really needs autorotate capabilities)\" and \"the pars are less than realistic (misses the mark on following the rules of golf)\". Touch Arcade gave the game 3.5 out of 5 stars saying \"it does exactly what it says on the tin cup\"."

For the third year in a row, he was named to the first All-Canadian team and captured back-to-back U Sports Defenceman of the Year honours.

In respect of matters relating to the eligibility of players, following a full review of the evidence, including statements and submissions from World Rugby, Rugby Europe, Belgium, Romania, Spain and Russia, the independent committee found:\nIn respect of sanctions, pursuant to Regulation 18, the independent committee determined the following:\nThe deduction of 5 points for any match in which a union fielded an ineligible player. in practice this meant the following\nTherefore, based on a re-modelling of the Rugby Europe Championship tables in the context of Rugby World Cup 2019 qualifying, Russia would qualify as Europe 1 into Pool A replacing Romania and Germany will replace Spain in the European play-off against Portugal.\nGeorgia's victory in the 2018 Rugby Europe Championship itself was unaffected. Germany's proposed promotion/relegation play-off with Portugal, however, becomes a Romania-Portugal play-off. Ironically, Germany would now face Portugal in the Rugby World Cup European qualification play-off."

        "title": "List of American Stanley Cup Finals television announcers",
        "text": "This is a list of American Stanley Cup Finals television announcers.\nPlay-by-play.\nNBC aired Games 1 and 4 of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings. Win Elliot served as the play-by-play man while Bill Mazer served as the color commentator for the games.\nFor the 1967 and 1968 playoffs, Jim Gordon worked play-by-play and Stu Nahan worked color commentary and intermission interviews for CBS. During the regular season, the duo alternated roles each week. For instance, Gordon provided the play-by-play on December 30 while Nahan did the same the next week. In , Dan Kelly did play-by-play while Bill Mazer did color and intermission interviews. While Dan Kelly once again handled all of the play-by-play work in 1971, Jim Gordon replaced Bill Mazer in . For the CBS' Stanley Cup Finals coverage during this period, a third voice was added to the booth (Phil Esposito in 1971 and Harry Howell in 1972).\nFrom –, NBC not only televised the Stanley Cup Finals (including a couple of games in prime time), but also weekly regular season games on Sunday afternoons. NBC also aired one regular season and a couple of playoff games in prime time during the first couple of seasons. Tim Ryan and Ted Lindsay (with Brian McFarlane as the intermission host) served as the commentators for NBC's NHL coverage during this period.\nFor the Stanley Cup Finals, Jiggs McDonald served as the play-by-play man while Bill Clement was the color commentator for SportsChannel America. Also during the Stanley Cup Finals, Mike Emrick served as the host while John Davidson served as the rinkside and intermission analyst (Herb Brooks filled that role in 1989).\n2003 was the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals that involved teams from one city in the same year, as both the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of game three between the San Antonio Spurs and the Nets in New Jersey on June 8, Brad Nessler said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night, also at Continental Airlines Arena. Gary Thorne mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler for promoting ABC's broadcast of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals.\nStudio hosts.\nNBC's coverage of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time that hockey games were broadcast on network television in color. The CBC would follow suit the following year. NBC's Stanley Cup coverage preempted a sports anthology series called \"NBC Sports in Action\", hosted by Jim Simpson and Bill Cullen, who were between-periods co-hosts for the Stanley Cup broadcasts.\nIn the season, Al Trautwig took over as studio host for the USA Network. Dan Kelly did play-by-play with either Gary Green or Rod Gilbert on color commentary. For the playoffs, Dick Carlson and Al Albert were added as play-by-play voices of some games. Meanwhile, Jim Van Horne hosted Stanley Cup Finals games played in Vancouver.\nThings pretty much remained the same for USA during the season. Dan Kelly and Gary Green called most games, while Al Albert did play-by-play on several playoff games and hosted one game of the Stanley Cup Finals.\nBroadcast networks.\nCBS managed to televise the 1971 Stanley Cup Finals clincher on a Tuesday night and the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals clincher on a Thursday night. In 1971, CBS was not scheduled to broadcast Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, but showed the prime time contest (the first ever occurrence of an NHL game being nationally televised in prime time in the United States) between the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Black Hawks after fans reportedly swamped switchboards at network headquarters in New York City asking that the seventh game be televised. Ironically, the game was not telecast by CBS' Chicago owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV, nor on CBS affiliates in most of Illinois (except areas near St. Louis), and parts of Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa, due to Blackhawks' owner Arthur M. Wirtz policy of not telecasting home games. While Dan Kelly once again handled all of the play-by-play work, Jim Gordon replaced Bill Mazer in . For the CBS' Stanley Cup Finals coverage during this period, a third voice was added to the booth (Phil Esposito in 1971 and Harry Howell in 1972).\nDuring the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals between the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, CBS took a rather calculated risk in not televising the Game 5 match on May 9 (CBS aired regular programming, including the original \"Hawaii Five-O\" in that time period on that Tuesday night). This was despite the fact that Game 5 was a potential clincher with the Bruins up three games to one on the Rangers. CBS ultimately lucked out (since the Rangers won Game 5 3–2), and televised the clincher (Game 6) on Thursday night, May 11.\nIn , ABC was contracted to televise game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. Since the Finals ended in five games, the contract was void. Had there been a Game 7, then Al Michaels would have called play-by-play alongside Jim McKay (between-periods host), Bobby Clarke (color commentator), and Frank Gifford (reporter, who would have been in the winning team's dressing room to interview players and coaches as well as hand the phone to the winning team's coach that would have allowed him to talk to both President Jimmy Carter and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau). This would give Michaels the honor of being the first announcer to call the play-by-play in all four major sports, having called the Super Bowl, the World Series, and NBA Finals. The game would have started at 5:10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on a Saturday, replacing \"Wide World of Sports\" and local news shows that typically followed it on ABC stations in the Eastern and Central time zones.\nMainly influenced by the United States men's Olympic hockey team's surprise gold medal victory (dubbed \"The Miracle on Ice\") in Lake Placid several months prior, CBS agreed to pay $37 million to broadcast the sixth game of the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals. In return, the NHL happily moved the starting time from prime time to the afternoon. The Saturday afternoon game was the first full American network telecast of an NHL game since Game 5 of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals aired on NBC. By this time, Dan Kelly was joined by former \"NHL on NBC\" commentator, Tim Ryan. Kelly did play-by-play for the first and third periods as well as overtime. Meanwhile, Tim Ryan did play-by-play only for the second period. Minnesota North Stars general manager Lou Nanne was the color commentator throughout the game. This turned out to be the last NHL game on American network television until NBC televised the 1990 All-Star Game.\nFOX split coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals with ESPN. Game 1 of the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals was the first Finals game shown on network television since and the first in prime time since 1973. FOX was scheduled to televise Games 1, 5, and 7; and ESPN airs Games 2, 3, 4, and 6. However, from 1995 to 1998, the Finals matches were all four game sweeps; the Finals ended in six games. The consequence was that – except for 1995, when Fox did televise game four – the decisive game was never shown on network television. Perhaps in recognition of this, Games 3 through 7 were always televised by ABC in the succeeding broadcast agreement between the NHL and ABC Sports/ESPN.\nBefore the 2004–05 lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC (who would replace ABC as the NHL's American national broadcast television partner) and ESPN. ESPN offered the NHL $60 million for about 40 games (only fifteen of which would be during the regular season), all on ESPN2, with presumably, only some midweek playoff games, the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals and the All-Star Game airing on ESPN. The NBC deal stipulated that the network would pay the league no rights fees - an unheard of practice to that point. NBC's deal included six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and Games 3–7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in primetime. The contracts were to commence when the lockout ended. The NBC deal expired after the 2006–07 season, and NBC had picked up the option to renew for the 2007–08 season (Just like the AFL/NBC agreement, which the network did not renew in 2006). The NHL and NBC shared in revenues from advertising.\nAs part of ESPN's new deal with the NHL, which starts with the 2021–22 season, ABC will exclusively air four Stanley Cup Finals over the life of the contract (2022, 2024, 2026, and 2028). This will be the first time that a broadcast over-the-air network will exclusively air the Stanley Cup Finals.\nCable.\nFor USA's final full season of NHL coverage in , Dan Kelly and Gary Green once again, did most games, while Al Albert and Green called the rest. In all, USA covered about 55 games, including 33 in the regular season. Also, Hartford Whalers goaltender Mike Liut was added as an intermission analyst for the Stanley Cup Finals.\nGames 1 and 2 of the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals were on OLN, while the remainder of the series was on NBC.\nUnder the terms of the contract running from 2007–2011, Versus aired 54 or more NHL games each season, generally on Monday and Tuesday nights, and provided coverage of as many Stanley Cup Playoff games as possible (generally two per night in the first two rounds; the Conference Finals are usually played on alternating days), and two games of the Stanley Cup Finals (Games 3 and 4 in , and ).\nIn , NBCSN broadcast Games 3 and 4, while NBC televised the remaining games. NBC Sports originally planned to repeat its coverage pattern from the last few seasons: NBCSN would televise Games 2 and 3, while NBC would broadcast Game 1, and then Games 4 through 7. After the League scheduled Game 2 on the day of the Belmont Stakes, coverage of games two and four were switched so NBC's telecast of the horse race would serve as lead-in programming to Game 2. Due to the death of a family member, NBC lead play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick missed Game 1. Kenny Albert, who was also the New York Rangers radio announcer for WEPN and announced several national games (including the Western Conference Finals) for NBC/NBCSN, filled in for Emrick in the first game.\nIt was originally announced that Games 2 and 3 of the Finals were to be broadcast by NBCSN, with the remainder on NBC. Game 2 was moved to NBC to serve as a lead-out for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of Game 4 on NBCSN. As Eddie Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he missed Game 2.\nOn May 27, 2016, NBC Sports announced that if the Finals was tied at 1-1 entering Game 3, then it would have aired on NBC and Game 4 televised on NBCSN. However, if one team led 2-0 (as this eventually happened; Penguins led 2–0), Game 3 would be moved to NBCSN and then Game 4 on NBC.\nPursuant to the announcement of Turner Sports (now TNT Sports) claiming the NHL's new “B” package for the 2021–22 season, on April 27, 2021, TNT will air three Stanley Cup Finals in 2023, 2025 and 2027. In the Finals, TNT's coverage was simulcast on sister networks TruTV and TBS, the latter unavailable on Tuesdays due to Major League Baseball coverage.\nSyndication.\nIn the United States, the clinching game of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals on the evening of Thursday, May 5 aired on RKO General's stations, such as WOR-TV in New York City and WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut. The commentators for RKO's coverage on that occasion were Bob Wolff and Emile Francis. Wolff at the time did play-by-play for New York Rangers games seen on WOR. Although the TV listings page of the May 5, 1966 edition of the \"Boston Globe\" indicated that RKO-owned WNAC-TV in Boston would not carry the game, the then-ABC-affiliated station did clear the broadcast at the last minute.\nThe 1976 Stanley Cup Finals on the NHL Network marked the first time that the NHL's championship series was nationally televised in its entirety in the United States. Starting in the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with \"Hockey Night in Canada\". In these games, Dan Kelly, who was the NHL Network's lead play-by-play broadcaster, was assigned to do play-by-play along with \"HNIC\" color commentators.\nThe entire 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers was simulcast as well. However, had that final gone to Game 7, then that game would have been broadcast on ABC.\nHughes televised Games 1-5 of the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals (the final game, Game 6, was broadcast by CBS). Hughes technically, used CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada\" feeds for the American coverage of the first five games of the Stanley Cup Finals."

Alfred Clarke, a former Australian player, was selected, but the New Zealand Cricket Council vetoed his participation on \"moral\" grounds.\nThe team that eventually toured was:\nThe matches.\nThe first two matches, in Tasmania, were not first-class.

They then had Victoria 129 for 5 before a series of dropped catches and an innings of 224 by Percy McAlister, batting at number seven, took Victoria to a total of 602. In their second innings the New Zealanders could make only 153, to lose by an innings and 132 runs.\nAt the Sydney Cricket Ground against New South Wales the New Zealanders fared even worse. They were dismissed for 140 and took the first two New South Wales wickets cheaply, but again they dropped a series of catches, and Victor Trumper scored 253 in five and a half hours out of a New South Wales total of 588. New Zealand were then dismissed for 64, Tom McKibbin bowling unchanged through the innings to take 7 for 30.\nBaker was the highest scorer in the two first-class matches with 109 runs at an average of 27.25. Downes was the top wicket-taker with six wickets at 38.33."

But the Red Lions' unlikely trio of Reynaldo Dionisio, Cornelio Manucat and last year's junior MVP Vincent Largo put San Beda to within 90-96 in the last 1:43. A triple by Olegario Topacio which beat the shotclock and two free throws by Reuben dela Rosa got the Cardinals off the hook.\nWith reserves Cornelio Manucat, Reynaldo Dionisio, Renato Morano and Jose Ramil Espina thrown into the limelight of championship action, the Red Lions broke away at 91-78 in the last 2:25 of Game 2. A 14-4 Mapua counter triggered by Olegario Topacio and Winchester Lemen put the Cardinals to within 92-95 in the last 45 seconds.\nCardinal slotman Benito Cheng beat all rebounders for a follow-up in the final five seconds of Game 3 and an awry pass spoiled the Red Lions' last offensive. There was no San Beda timeout and what ensued was a quick inbound to Cornelio Manucat who dribbled toward the centerline before issuing a breast-pass to a streaking Reynaldo Dionisio. The pass was too strong and a bit high, lipping Dionisio's fingertips before going out of bounds with a stream of Mapua supporters entering the court at the buzzer.\nJuniors' tournament.\nFinals.\nThe San Beda Red Cubs won Game 1 off the heroics of Tyrone Bautista, Emerson Roque and Cesar Tolentino, who combined for 53 points. The Red Robins tied the series on Game 2. On the deciding Game 3, Bautista led the Red Cubs anew, winning back-to-back titles."

The windsurfing classes have changed dramatically. The IOC called the sport Olympic Boardsailing to affirm the inclusion to Olympic Sailing, then the more mainstream and classic name Windsurfing was adopted. The recent foil design lifts the board completely above the water with only water contact at the fin. This creates an astonishing appearance of hovering over the water. The dramatically reduced resistance from the water makes this IQ Foil design ultra efficient with decreased effort from the uni student and increased pace over the water.\nLegend:\nMedal table.\nLast updated after the \"2019 Summer Universiade\"."

Mexico allowed 19 runs, Italy allowed 20 runs, and Venezuela allowed 21 runs. Italy and Venezuela played 19 innings each in the two matches, therefore their RA/IPD were 1.053 and 1.105.

        "text": "Adrián Arturo Tomas Sánchez (born August 16, 1990) is a Colombian-Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals.\nCareer.\nWashington Nationals.\nThe Washington Nationals signed Sánchez as an amateur free agent from Venezuela on January 21, 2007. He played in the Dominican Republic for the Dominican Summer League Nationals in the rookie-level Dominican Summer League in 2007 and 2008, batting .269 in 42 games with a home run and 19 runs batted in (RBI) in 2007 and .276 in 59 games with three home runs and 32 RBIs in 2008. He spent 2009 with the Gulf Coast League Nationals in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League, appearing in 24 games and hitting .246 with five RBIs, and began the 2010 season with them, hitting .378 in 29 games with three home runs and 21 RBIs before being promoted to the Hagerstown Suns in the Single-A South Atlantic League, where he hit .317 in 25 games, had a home run, and drove in 15 runs. He spent all of 2011 with Hagerstown and batted .262 with three home runs and 51 RBIs in 131 games. He was promoted to the Potomac Nationals in the High-A Carolina League and played for Potomac in 2012 and 2013, hitting .269 with three home runs and 32 RBIs in 101 games in 2012 but only .241 with one home run in 120 games in 2013, although he drove in 42 runs that season. He began 2014 with Potomac, hitting .271 with nine RBIs in 29 games, and received a promotion to the Harrisburg Senators in the Double-A Eastern League, where he finished the season but batted only .223 in 89 games, hitting three home runs and driving in 29 runs. Demoted to Potomac to begin the 2015 season, he played 19 games there, hitting .343 and a home run and driving in six runs, and four games with the Gulf Coast Nationals, going 5-for-11 with a home run and an RBI, before returning to Harrisburg, and he hit .246 in 59 games and had a home run and 15 RBIs with the Senators. In 2016, he began the season with the Syracuse Chiefs in the Triple-A International League, but he hit only .216 with three RBIs in 14 games and returned to Harrisburg, playing 97 games for the Senators, hitting .254 and driving in 25 runs.\n2017 season.\nAfter starting the 2017 season with Double-A Harrisburg, hitting .250 with a home run and three RBIs, Sánchez moved up to Triple-A Syracuse. He had spent a decade in the Washington Nationals organization without ever being added to the 40-man roster or receiving an invitation to major-league spring training when, following an injury to Nationals starting shortstop Trea Turner on June 29, 2017, he was promoted from Syracuse to take Turner's place on the roster. At the time, he was hitting .259 at Syracuse with four home runs and 18 RBIs. He made his major league debut on June 30 against the St. Louis Cardinals, pinch-running for Stephen Drew and playing shortstop for one inning. On July 1, Sánchez got his first major league at-bat as a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded and the Nationals trailing by a run with two outs in the ninth inning. After working the count full against Cardinal's reliever Matt Bowman, Sánchez took a pitch well outside, believing it was ball four for what would have been a game-tying walk. However, umpire Manny Gonzalez called it strike three to end the game. On July 7, inserted on a double switch to play shortstop in the tenth inning, Sánchez lined a single up the middle off reliever Ian Krol of the Atlanta Braves for his first MLB hit. He came around to score as the Nationals walked off the Braves on a single by Daniel Murphy, his first MLB run.\nAt bat against Jeurys Familia of the New York Mets in an August 26, 2017, game, Sánchez reacted to an errant pitch well inside by attempting to bunt the ball away from him, but instead foul-tipped it back into his chest, sending him to the ground. After a visit from Nationals trainer Paul Lessard, Sánchez resumed the at-bat and singled home his third run batted in of the day, earning a standing ovation from the home crowd at Nationals Park. Sánchez spent the night in the hospital but was cleared to return after a CT scan revealed no damage. He did not appear in another game before being optioned back to Class AAA Syracuse on August 29, as Turner was activated from the 60-day disabled list.\nSánchez was again recalled on September 8, after rosters expanded. He doubled in a run in a September 10 contest against the Philadelphia Phillies to break a scoreless tie and subsequently rookie center fielder Víctor Robles drove him home on Robles's first career major-league hit. The Nationals went on to win and clinch their second consecutive National League East division title that day.\n2018 season.\nSánchez began the 2018 season at Triple-A Syracuse. On April 24, the Nationals called him up to the major leagues. He played in five games and went 3-for-14 (.214), with one RBI and one strikeout. When the Nationals reactivated third baseman Anthony Rendon from the 10-day disabled list on May 5, they made room for him on the roster by optioning Sánchez back to Syracuse. Through May 18, he had played in 24 games for Syracuse during the season, batting .298 with a .352 on-base percentage, a .426 slugging percentage, a home run, and eight RBIs for the Chiefs. When the Nationals′ roster temporarily expanded to 26 players on the day of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 19, they recalled Sánchez from Syracuse to serve as the 26th man for the second game of the day. He remained with the Nationals after the doubleheader, as other Nationals roster moves allowed him to stay on the roster after it returned to 25 players the following day. Sánchez appeared in 10 more games, going 1-for-9 (.111), scoring a run, and bringing his overall major-league performance at the plate for 2018 to 4-for-23 (.174) before Washington optioned him to Syracuse again on June 12 to clear room on its roster for Daniel Murphy when Murphy came off the disabled list to make his season debut with the Nationals.\nApart from a brief rehabilitation stint with the Gulf Coast League Nationals from August 6 to 12, Sánchez remained with Syracuse until the Nationals recalled him on August 21. They optioned him back to Syracuse on August 22, then recalled him again on September 4, and he remained with the Nationals through the end of the season. He finished the season hitting .276 in 28 major-league games, with two doubles, a triple, and three RBIs. In his 13 major-league starts, he went 14-for-45 (.311) with two doubles, one triple, three RBI, one walk, and seven runs scored. By the end of the 2018 season, Sánchez had made 62 appearances – 23 games at second base, 14 games at shortstop, and eight at third base, all with the Nationals – in major-league games across two seasons during his career, 28 of them starts, hitting .271 with nine doubles, one triple, 14 RBI, and 14 runs scored.\nIn the minors in 2018, Sánchez appeared in 70 games for Syracuse, hitting .234 with 15 doubles, two triples, four home runs, 27 RBIs, and six stolen bases, and in his five=game rehabilitation stint with the Gulf Coast League Nationals he hit .467 with two doubles, a triple, a home run, and four RBIs.\n2019–20 seasons.\nThe Nationals optioned Sánchez to their new Triple-A affiliate, the Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League, just after the conclusion of spring training in 2019, but the Grizzlies′ season had not yet begun when they recalled him to Washington on April 3 after Trea Turner suffered a broken finger in a game on April 2 and went on the 10-day injured list. Sánchez made no appearances for Washington before the Nationals optioned him to Double-A Harrisburg on April 7, in time for Harrisburg′s season to begin the following day.\nWith Harrisburg on April 14, Sánchez played in his 1,000th minor league game, all in the Washington Nationals organization; although playing 1,000 or more minor-league games during a career was not uncommon, playing 1,000 minor league games for a single organization was a rarity. His total included 156 games with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, 256 with Double-A Harrisburg, 269 with the High-A Potomac Nationals, 156 with the Single-A Hagerstown Suns, 62 with the rookie-level Gulf Coast League Nationals, and 101 with the rookie-level DSL Nationals. Since signing with the Nationals on January 21, 2007, he had become the second-longest-tenured player in the Nationals organization, with only Ryan Zimmerman having a longer association with the Nationals at the time. In addition to 1,000 minor-league games, he had played in 62 major-league games with the Nationals, giving him a total of 1,062 appearances at all levels combined in games in the Nationals organization during his career, the most by any player. In 28 games with the Nationals, Sanchez finished with a .226 average and an RBI. The Nationals finished the 2019 year with a 93-69 record, clinching a wild card spot, and eventually won the World Series over the Houston Astros. Sanchez was not active during the team's postseason run, but he still won his first world championship.\nSánchez did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 9, 2020, Sánchez was removed from the 40-man roster and sent outright to Triple-A. Sánchez resigned with the Nationals on a minor league deal on November 5.\n2021–22 seasons.\nSánchez was assigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings to begin the season. After hitting .336 with 4 home runs and 18 RBIs, his contract was selected by the Nationals on July 30, 2021. In 16 games, he hit .257/.316/.314 with no home runs and 1 RBI. Sánchez was designated for assignment on September 13, 2021, as veteran Jordy Mercer returned from the injured list.

        "text": "The 1984 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 1984 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 1983-84 NCAA Division I men's basketball season The game was played on April 2, 1984 at the Kingdome in Seattle, Washington, and featured the West Regional Champion, #1-seeded Georgetown and the Midwest Regional Champion, #2-seeded Houston.\nThis was the last championship game to ever feature a team from the Southwest Conference, which disbanded in 1996.\nBackground.\nGeorgetown reached the Final Four for the third time in school history and second time in three years to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the \"Twin Towers,\" Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Bowie and Turpin managed to get Ewing into foul trouble early, and with him on the bench and Reggie Williams shooting only 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field during the game, the Wildcats raced out to a 27–15 lead with 3:06 left in the first half. After that however, the Hoyas made a defensive stand still unequalled in college basketball: Kentucky scored only two more points in the first half; the Wildcats also did not score in the first 9 minutes 55 seconds of the second half, missing their first 12 shots and after that shooting 3-for-21 (14.3%) during the remainder of the game. Overall, Kentucky shot 3-for-33 (9.1 percent) from the field during the second half. Although he played for only 17 minutes and suffered a season-ending foot injury in the second half, Gene Smith had one of the best defensive games of his career. Bowie and Turpin finished the game a combined 0-for-12, Wingate scored 12 points and held Kentuckys Jim Master to 2-for-7 (28.6%) shooting from the field, Michael Jackson scored 12 points and pulled down a career-high 10 rebounds, and Georgetown won 53–40 to advance to the national final for the third time in school history and second time in three years.\nMeanwhile, Houston was making its second straight national title game appearance after North Carolina State had famously upset them in Albuquerque in 1983. Clyde Drexler had declared for the NBA Draft after that season, but Hakeem Olajuwon remained on the roster.\nGame summary.\nReggie Williams demonstrated his true potential for the first time in the national championship game, putting in a strong defensive performance and shooting 9-for-18 (50.0%) from the field with 19 points and seven rebounds in the game, while Wingate scored 16 points and Ewing managed 10 points and nine rebounds. Jackson scored 11 points and had six assists, two of which set up Ewing and Graham for decisive baskets late in the game. The game was decided well before the final whistle, and the Hoyas won the schools first national championship 84–75.\nLate in the game, with Georgetown enjoying a comfortable lead, Thompson began to pull starters out and give bench players some time on the court; the game's enduring image came when senior guard Fred Brown came out of the game. Two years earlier at the same stage in New Orleans against North Carolina, after Michael Jordan had given the Tar Heels the lead, Brown had mistakenly passed the ball to James Worthy with less than 15 seconds to go, ruining Georgetowns chances for a final game-winning shot and allowing North Carolina to take the national championship, and cameras had captured Thompson consoling a devastated Brown with a hug as the Tar Heels celebrated. As Brown left the 1984 championship game, cameras caught Brown and Thompson again embracing on the sideline, this time to celebrate a victory.\nAftermath.\nOlajuwon declared for the NBA Draft after the game and remained in Houston as he was selected #1 overall by the Rockets ahead of Sam Bowie at #2 by the Portland Trail Blazers and Michael Jordan at #3 by the Chicago Bulls. Ewing returned for his senior season and helped lead Georgetown back to the national championship game, but the Hoyas were upset by conference rival Villanova.\nTen years after the game, Olajuwon and Ewing faced each other in the 1994 NBA Finals between the Rockets and the New York Knicks, which the Rockets won in seven games to win the first of two consecutive NBA championships. As of 2024, this is the last time Houston has appeared in the national championship game, and would not return to the Final Four until 2021."

        "text": "The 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. It determined the national champion for the 1982–83 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 4, 1983, at The Pit in Albuquerque, New Mexico and paired top-ranked, #1 seed Midwest Regional Champions, the Houston Cougars, and sixteenth-ranked, #6 seed West Regional Champions, the NC State Wolfpack.\nThe first half of the national championship game favored NC State. Not only did the Wolfpack lead 33–25, but Houston's Clyde Drexler picked up four first-half fouls. The Cougars opened the second half with a dominating 17–2 run to seize a seven-point lead, 42–35. NC State was able to keep the game close, as Houston's star center Hakeem Olajuwon checked out of the game multiple times to receive oxygen, leading the Cougars to slow the pace of the game in order to protect the lead. Tied at 52 with 44 seconds remaining, NC State held the ball for a final shot attempt. Houston's Benny Anders narrowly missed stealing the ball as the clock ticked down. After gathering the deflected ball nearly 30 feet from the basket, Dereck Whittenburg launched a desperation shot that fell short of the rim. Olajuwon hesitated in fear of a goaltending call, allowing Lorenzo Charles to catch the ball and dunk it for the 54–52 victory. One of the indelible images in tournament history is of winning coach Jim Valvano running onto the court after the game ended looking for Whittenburg.\nNC State's magical, improbable postseason run and national championship win, highlighted by Charles' game-winning dunk, remain a legendary representation of March Madness.\nParticipants.\nNC State Wolfpack.\nDespite a preseason ranking of #16 in the AP poll, the Wolfpack sputtered to a 9–7 record after losing at Maryland on January 29. Three close victories in the ACC Tournament saved NC State from missing the NCAA Tournament altogether. Three of the team's four victories on the road to the Final Four came by one or two points. The Wolfpack trailed with a minute or less to play in six of their eight postseason games before this game.\nHouston Cougars.\nHouston was ranked #14 in the AP poll to open the season, and fell to 5–2 after a 72–63 loss to #1 Virginia in Tokyo on December 16, 1982. The Cougars then ran off a 26-game winning streak, capturing the #1 ranking in the process, that was capped by a 94–81 victory over #2 Louisville to advance to the National Championship Game.\nGame summary.\nNC State led at halftime by a score of 33–25. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star Clyde Drexler, who picked up three fouls early in the first half yet was begging to stay in the game. NC State sophomore guard Terry Gannon drew a controversial charging foul against Drexler to put him at four and leave him one foul away from disqualification; replays showed, and Drexler maintained later, that Gannon had appeared to grab Drexler's legs and pull him down with him and thus should have been called for a defensive foul.\nIn the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game, eventually taking a seven-point lead at 52–45. Since the game was played in Albuquerque, players had to deal with the city's mile-high altitude. The Cougars' star center, Hakeem Olajuwon, had problems adjusting to the environment and tired quickly, needing to check out of the game multiple times so he could put on an oxygen mask and recover.\nWith Olajuwon on the bench, Houston head coach Guy Lewis decided that in order to protect the lead and Olajuwon's health at the same time, the Cougars slowed the game down. This enabled the Wolfpack to return to their standby strategy of extending the game. Houston's free throw shooting was very suspect entering the game (60.9% on the season), which worked greatly in NC State's favor as they were able to rally back and even the score at 52 in the final two minutes.\nOn what would be the last Houston possession, Valvano called for his players to back off and let freshman guard Alvin Franklin bring the ball up the court and stand by while Houston passed the ball around before they committed their foul. Valvano's strategy was to foul Franklin once he got the ball back, and Whittenburg did exactly that with 1:05 left in regulation.\nThe move was largely psychological, according to Whittenburg. Since Franklin was the youngest player on the Houston squad, everyone on the NC State side felt he could not handle the pressure of the moment with a potential championship at stake. The theory proved correct as Franklin missed the free throw, and the Wolfpack grabbed the rebound.\nValvano called timeout with 44 seconds left and drew up a play for senior guard Dereck Whittenburg that called for the team to pass him the ball with ten seconds left on the clock so he could take the final shot.\nHouston needed a defensive stop so they could get another chance to close out the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court zone trap defense. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control of the ball. The ball eventually wound up in the hands of guard Sidney Lowe, who gave it to forward and fellow senior Thurl Bailey in the corner.\nTrying to keep the ball moving, as he had been double teamed as soon as he received the pass, Bailey looked back toward Whittenburg, who was approximately thirty feet away from the hoop near midcourt. Bailey threw what Whittenburg would later call a \"poor fundamental\" overhanded pass which Houston's Benny Anders, guarding Whittenburg on the play, was in position to steal. At this point, Whittenburg hearkened back to his high school days with Morgan Wootten at DeMatha Catholic High School, where he was taught to always catch the basketball with both hands. If Whittenburg had not attempted to do so in this case, Anders may have gotten the steal and a game-winning breakaway layup. In college basketball at the time, the game clock continued to run after a made field goal, and the Wolfpack likely would not have had time even to inbound the ball. As it was, Anders knocked the ball out of Whittenburg's hands, but Whittenburg quickly regained control.\nThe clock, meanwhile, had ticked down to five seconds and Whittenburg was still standing a significant distance from the goal. Once he regained control, Whittenburg turned and launched a desperation shot to try and win the game for NC State. The shot's trajectory took it to the front of the basket where Olajuwon was covering Wolfpack center Lorenzo Charles. As he watched the shot, Olajuwon said he knew the shot was going to come up short but he also did not want to go for the ball too early because of the potential for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the indecision by Olajuwon and went up for the air ball, then in one motion scored the go-ahead points with a two-handed tip-in dunk. The final two seconds ticked off the clock before Houston could inbound the ball, and with that the game ended and the Wolfpack were the national champions.\nDespite the loss, Olajuwon was named Tournament MOP as he collected 41 points, 40 rebounds, and 15 blocked shots in the Final Four alone. To date, this remains the last time a player from the losing team was named Most Outstanding Player.\nIt was NC State's second NCAA championship. Their first championship was in 1974, when they defeated the Marquette Warriors. The Wolfpack became the first team to win the NCAA Tournament with at least 10 losses.\nIt also marked Drexler's final college game, as he entered the 1983 NBA draft with a year of eligibility remaining and was selected 14th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers. In 1995, he returned to Houston and rejoined Olajuwon after the defending champion Rockets traded Otis Thorpe to the Trail Blazers for him in the middle of the season, and he helped lead the Rockets to a second straight NBA championship."

He played nine seasons for the Atleticos de San German in the city of San German, averaging 7.5 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. \nBasketball career.\nMorales began playing for the Atleticos in 1963, playing in 14 games that season, with an average of 4.2 points a game, without recording a rebound or assist in any of the 14 games he played at.\nFor the next two years, his stats did not improve very much, but in 1966, he saw an increase in play time, which in turn led to a much improved level of performance and he averaged double digits in scoring for the first time in his BSN career, scoring 230 points in 20 games for an average of 11.5 points a game. He also caught his first recorded BSN rebound and passed his first recorded BSN assist, finishing with 2.6 and 1.1 per game in those two categories, respectively.\nAside from having a woeful season from the free-throw line during 1967, (he made only 38 of 171 attempts for an average of 22 percent free throws made) the 1967 BSN season turned out to be the best, statistically speaking, of Morales' 9 seasons at Puerto Rico's top professional basketball league, as he averaged 13.7 points per game, with 4.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game, all career highs for the young basketball player.\nThose numbers declined sharply during the 1968 season, when he was able to play in only 9 games due to injury, and had averages of 6.6 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. Morales spent the 1969 BSN season sidelined and returned during the 1970 season, faring a bit better statistically-wise but also falling victim to injury again. During the 1970 season, Nelson Morales played in 11 BSN games, averaging 1.8 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 8.2 points per game.\nOnce again, injuries hampered his career during 1970 and 1971, year in which he did not see action during the 1971 BSN season. In 1972, Morales returned to the BSN basketball courts, participating in 13 games for the Atleticos, scoring 6.6 points, passing for 2.0 assists and catching 1.5 rebounds for the Atleticos.\nFinally, Morales participated in 8 games during the 1973 BSN season for the Atleticos, with an average of 1.0 points and rebounds per game, without recording any assists. He announced his retirement from professional basketball soon after.\nOther sports.\nThe town of San German honored Morales by naming a local softball league, the \"Nelson 'Cayito' Morales\" softball league. The league was incorporated in 2002."

Nicknamed \"Voltage\", he became the 2018 PDC World Darts Champion following his victory over Phil Taylor. Cross won the World Championship on his debut, having turned professional just 11 months prior to the event.\nBDO career.\n2015.\nIn October 2015, Cross attempted to qualify for the 2016 BDO World Darts Championship, where he was knocked out in the last 64 by Tony Martin. He also competed in the 2015 World Masters, losing to Darius Labanauskas in the last 48.\nPDC career.\n2016.\nCross competed in the 2016 UK Open as an amateur Rileys qualifier; making it to the last 32 before falling to world number one Michael van Gerwen, who achieved a nine-dart finish in the process. Following this, he competed in the PDC Challenge Tour, winning three of the 16 events and ultimately topping the Order of Merit, consequently earning a Tour Card for the 2017 PDC Pro Tour.\n2017.\nAt the 2017 UK Open, Cross reached the fifth round before being knocked out by eventual winner Peter Wright. The following week, he won his first PDC title by defeating Mervyn King 6–5 in the final of the third Players Championship. His first year on the tour continued positively, winning the 12th event with a 6–5 victory over Ian White, who missed five darts for the title.\nCross then beat Peter Wright 6–2 in the 19th Players Championship in Dublin and quickly added his 4th Players Championship (PC21) with a 6–3 win against Adrian Lewis to move into the top 32 for the first time.\nCross reached the final of two events in the 2017 PDC European Tour, the German Darts Grand Prix and the European Darts Trophy, both times losing to Michael van Gerwen. He reached his first premier event final in October at the 2017 European Championship, again losing to van Gerwen.\n2018.\nCross made his World Championship debut in 2018 as the 20th seed, reaching the final against Phil Taylor following wins over Seigo Asada, Michael Smith (in which Cross survived two match darts), John Henderson, Dimitri Van den Bergh and Michael van Gerwen (in which Cross survived six match darts). In the final he defeated Taylor, who had previously announced that he would retire after the tournament, 7–2 in sets. He is the only player to have survived match darts in two rounds and then go on to win the World title. Winning the World Championship meant that he finished at number 3 in the PDC Order of Merit and earned automatic qualification for the 2018 Premier League Darts.\nCross was tipped by a few pundits to have an off year as they thought that the pressure of being world champion would get to him, despite this he made a good showing on his Premier League debut making it to the semi-finals.\nHowever, he only won one players championship title in comparison to 2017 where he won 4, he won players' championship 13 by defeating Peter Wright in the final and he won his first World Series event which was the Brisbane Darts Masters by defeating Michael Van Gerwen 10–6 in the final. He had made two previous World Series finals that year: Las Vegas and Shanghai.\n2019.\nIn defence of his world title at the 2019 World Championship, Cross lost 4–2 in the fourth round to Luke Humphries.\nCross made his 3rd major final and 6th televised final at the 2019 UK Open in Minehead. Cross was eventual runner-up at the tournament, as he lost heavily to Nathan Aspinall.\nCross made his second televised final of the year (4th major, 7th televised) at the 2019 Premier League Darts. After finishing 2nd in the league format, Cross went to the O2 in London for the Play-Offs. He took on James Wade in the semi-final and was successful in victory. He then took on World Number One, Michael van Gerwen in the final. He eventually lost the tournament by 11–6.\nHe won the World Matchplay against Michael Smith by beating him 18–13 in legs. Cross became only the fourth player to ever win the World Championship and World Matchplay (previously achieved by Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson).

        "title": "Handicap (sailing)",
        "text": "Handicap forms for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs.\nTypically sailing vessel classes, including international classes, are defined by measurement rules, which categorise vessels accordingly into classes of vessels, and vessels compete within their class. Handicapping allows vessels to compete across classes, and also allows vessels and crews to compete based on performance and equipment on an equal basis, by adjusting the race outcome data, to declare a \"handicap\" (adjusted) winner as distinct from a \"line honours\" (first over the finish line) winner.\nHistory.\nDuring the early part of the 19th century interest in yacht racing had achieved sufficient momentum to need an agreed handicapping system to allow different types of yacht to race on an equitable basis. The method of measuring merchant sailing ships carried over into the world of yacht racing so that a yacht also now had a measured tonnage which allowed size comparisons and hence performance comparisons to be made between yachts on the basis that a properly designed big yacht will sail faster than a properly designed small yacht.\nEach yacht fell within a Class based upon its measured tonnage. In the early 19th century four ranges of tonnage and hence four Classes were defined. Based on experience gained from the results of numerous races each Class was allocated a distance allowance that the Class had to give away to the next lower Class. This was equivalent to a Class 1 having to sail more distance than a Class 4 yacht during a race.\nIn 1834 handicapping by distance was changed to handicapping by time.\nAs yacht racing in particular became more and more popular designers started to look for and found loopholes in the measurement rules to enable a design to get a better rating. Whilst this encouraged designers it discouraged owners from participating in handicap racing because designs were being outdated almost before the yacht was launched.\nIn order to restore the equilibrium, work began on new formulas, which resulted, in the Thames Measurement which was the first formula defined for yachts.\nThe adoption of the British Thames Measurement by the Yacht Club de France in 1870 may mark the beginning of international rating rules. In 1893, the Germano-Scandinavian Union was formed and it developed its \"Union Rule\". Starting in 1902, under the leadership of the New York Yacht Club, U.S. yacht clubs agreed to a Universal Rule in 1905 which was based on a formula developed by Nathanael Herreshoff.\nThe Universal Rule determined a yacht's eligibility to race in the America's Cup from 1914 to 1937 and for this the J-class was chosen. Boats built according to the rule reached their peak in the large J-class yachts. This Rating Rule is intended to calculate a rating for yachts, which can then be used to calculate its Time Correction Factor (T.C.F.) in order to have disparate yachts racing against each other.\nThe International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule.\nThe IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an \"IOR rating\", in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail.\nThe IOR was superseded by the International Measurement System (IMS), now updated as Offshore Racing Congress Rule (ORC) and International Rating Certificate (IRC). While some yachts race at club level under ORC or IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules.\nIn the United States, the most common handicapping rule is the PHRF rule, developed and promoted by the United States Sailing Association. While most other rules do not take past performance into account, PHRF differentiates itself by allowing skippers to request handicap reductions after a series of poor racing results.\nIn Europe, the most common handicapping system used today is the IRC rule.\nInternational Rating Certificate.\nIRC is a system managed by the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) in the United Kingdom through their dedicated Rating Office, and the Union Nationale pour la Course au Large (UNCL) in France.\nOffshore Racing Congress Rule.\nThe ORC is a system managed by the Offshore Racing Congress.\nPerformance Handicap Racing Fleet.\nPerformance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) is a handicapping system used for yacht racing in North America. It allows dissimilar classes of sailboats to be raced against each other. The aim is to cancel out the inherent advantages and disadvantages of each class of boats, so that results reflect crew skill rather than equipment superiority.\nPHRF is used mainly for larger sailboats (i.e., 7 meters and above). For dinghy racing, the Portsmouth yardstick handicapping system is more likely to be used.\nThe handicap number assigned to a class of yachts is based on the yacht's speed relative to a theoretical yacht with a rating of 0. A yacht's handicap, or rating, is the number of seconds per mile traveled that the yacht in question should be behind the theoretical yacht. Most boats have a positive PHRF rating, but some very fast boats have a negative PHRF rating. If Boat A has a PHRF rating of 15 and Boat B has a rating of 30 and they compete on a 1-mile course, Boat A should finish approximately 15 seconds in front of Boat B. Results are adjusted for handicap by the race committee after all competitors have finished.\nEach region has its own variation on PHRF rules and ratings, based on local conditions.\nIn some countries a Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) may be used to rate trailer sailers, such as in NZ and in the USA and Canada.\nYardstick.\nRather than a vessel measurement rule, Yardstick as in Portsmouth Yardstick is used in the UK is a way of rating different classes of trailer yachts relative to each other. These are adjusted annually at a state or regional level. At a club level, starting from a CBH or Yardstick rating a Performance Based Handicap or PBH may be used, such as PBH. This attempts to measure the relative performance of a particular yacht and crew against other yachts and crews either of the same type of other type. Clubs will often run an event or season championship based only upon a CBH rating together with a handicap winner based upon a regularly adjusted PBH figure for each yacht and crew. In theory the PBH which is adjusted after each race gives each boat an equal chance of winning each race.\nInternational rule.\nThe International rule, also known as the Metre rule, was created for the measuring and rating of yachts to allow different designs of yacht to race together under a handicap system. Prior to the ratification of the International rule in 1907, countries raced yachts under their own national rules and international competition was always subject to various forms of subjective handicapping.\nClass Based Handicap.\nClass Based Handicap (CBH) measurement system is used, for example, for trailer sailers, such as in Australia and also in New Zealand.\nIn Australia, the CBH system is a nationally governed handicap designed to assess the potential speed of the boat. It does not take into account the experience of the crew. Vessels are given a rating number based on a set of measurements. It represents a very well sailed boat kept in top racing condition, that is the boat at minimum weight, good sails, fair hull.\nVelocity prediction program.\nVelocity prediction program (VPP)s are used by a variety of sailing organizations to assess theoretical boat performance and then assign \"handicaps\" to allow boats of different styles and sizes to race against one another. The IOR and IMS handicapping rules were some of the earliest adopters of VPPs."

        "text": "A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give it a disadvantage when racing against slower horses.\nThe skill in betting on a handicap race lies in predicting which horse can overcome its handicap. Although most handicap races are run for older, less valuable horses, this is not true in all cases; some great races are handicaps, such as the Grand National steeplechase in England and the Melbourne Cup in Australia. In the United States over 30 handicap races are classified as Grade I, the top level of the North American grading system.\nHandicapping in action.\nIn a horse handicap race (sometimes just called \"handicap\"), each horse must carry a specified weight called the impost, assigned by the racing secretary or steward based on factors such as past performances, so as to equalize the chances of the competitors. To supplement the combined weight of jockey and saddle, up to the assigned impost, lead weights are carried in saddle pads with pockets, called lead pads.\nThe weight-for-age scale was introduced by Admiral Rous, a steward of the Jockey Club. In 1855 he was appointed public handicapper. In Britain the horses are assigned weights according to a centralised rating system maintained by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). Weights may be increased if a horse wins a race between the publication of the weights and the running of the contest.\nPredicting the outcome of races.\nIn the USA, (thoroughbred) handicapping may also refer to the act of predicting and betting on horse racing."

        "text": "The Adelaide Oval is a sports stadium located in Adelaide, South Australia. It was established in 1871 and has been used for a wide variety of sports, with the primary uses being cricket and Australian Rules Football. The first international cricket match was held on the ground in 1884 and it remains a major venue for Test cricket. The ground hosted its first One Day International (ODI) in 1975 and its first Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) in 2011, with both the Australian men's and women's teams playing T20Is at the ground on the same day. In addition, it has hosted women's Test and ODI matches and was the first ground at which a day-night Test was played.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test and One Day International matches.\nThree bowlers took five-wicket hauls in the first Test match played on the ground. England's Billy Bates took five wickets for 31 runs (5/31) in the first innings of the match in 1884. His team-mate Bobby Peel and Australia's Joey Palmer also took five-wicket hauls during the match. England's Johnny Briggs was the first player to take 10 wickets in a match, taking 5/51 and 6/49 in 1892, whilst the best Test match innings bowling figures on the ground were recorded by Australia's Albert Trott who took 8/43 in 1895. The first woman to take five wickets in an innings was Australia's Betty Wilson who took 5/23 in the first Woman's Test played on the ground in 1949.\nThe first One Day International five-wicket haul on the ground was taken by West Indian Andy Roberts who took 5/22 against England in 1980. The first ODI five-wicket haul taken by an Australian was by Carl Rackemann who took 5/16 against Pakistan in 1984, figures which remain the best ODI bowling figures at the venue.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nThere have been a total of 119 five-wicket hauls taken in Test matches on the ground, including four taken in women's Tests.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 13 five-wicket hauls have been taken in ODIs on the ground."

Ranking tournaments are those that are used for the official system of ranking professional snooker players which is used to determine automatic qualification and seeding for tournaments on the World Snooker Tour.\nHistory.\nThe first rankings were produced after the 1976 World Snooker Championship and were based on performances in the 1974, 1975 and 1976 World Championships. This has led to the 1974 World Snooker Championship being regarded as the first ranking tournament.\nThe same rudimentary system was used for a number of years, but the rankings for the 1983–84 season included performances in two additional tournaments during the 1982–83 season. The UK Championship became a ranking tournament in 1984, contributing points to the following season's rankings for the first time.\nIn the 1992–93 season, and from 2010–11 to 2015–16, a number of events were classified as \"minor-ranking tournaments\". These contributed to the world rankings but to a lesser degree than the standard ranking tournaments. From 2010 to 2016, the minor-ranking events were all part of the Players Tour Championship. These events are not included in the list below.\nWinners.\nRonnie O'Sullivan holds the record with 41 wins in ranking tournaments. 75 players have won at least one ranking event. The most recent first-time winner is Zhang Anda who won the 2023 International Championship."

        "text": "The following is about the qualification rules and allocation of spots for the figure skating events at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nQualification system.\nA total of 148 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 18 athletes can be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 9 men or 9 women. A further ten team trophy quotas can be distributed to countries qualifying for the team event, but not the discipline itself. This means up to a maximum of 158 athletes can partake. If these additional ten quotas are not used, then the host (South Korea) may use them to qualify for each event, but may not qualify for the team event by use of these additional quotas.\nSkater qualification.\nThere is no individual athlete qualification to the Olympics; the choice of which athlete(s) to send to the Games is at the discretion of each country's National Olympic Committee. Each country is allowed a maximum of three entries per discipline, resulting in a maximum of 18 athletes (nine men and nine women) possible per country.\nAccording to ISU rules, countries must select their entries from among skaters who have achieved a minimum technical elements score (TES) at an ISU-recognized international competition on or before 29 January 2018.\nCountry qualification.\nThe number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee. A total of 148 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. There will be 30 skaters in the disciplines of men's and ladies' singles, 20 pair skating teams, and 24 ice dance teams. Additionally, ten nations qualified for the team event.\nCountries were able to qualify entries to the 2018 Winter Olympics in two ways. Most spots were allocated based on the results of the 2017 World Championships. At the event, countries were able to qualify up to three entries in each discipline according to the usual system in place; countries which earned multiple spots to the Olympics also earned multiple spots to the 2018 World Championships. Every discipline qualified separately.\nAt the World Championships, the system was as follows:\nQualification spots available per tournament.\nThe results of the 2017 World Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries in each singles discipline, 16 in pairs, and 19 in ice dance. The available spots were awarded going down the results list, with multiple spots being awarded first.\nThe remainder of the spots were filled at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany in late September 2017. Countries which had already earned an entry to the Olympics were not allowed to qualify more entries at this final qualifying competition. Unlike at the World Championships, where countries could qualify more than one spot depending on the placement of the skater, at this ISU competition countries could earn only one spot per discipline, regardless of placement. Initially, a total of six spots per singles event, four spots in pairs, and five in ice dance were available at the ISU competition.\nIf a country declines to use one or more of its qualified spots, the vacated spot is awarded using the results of the ISU competition in descending order of placement. By the time the ISU competition was held, one more spot in pairs and one more spot in ice dance became available according to this rule.\nFor the team trophy, scores from the 2016–17 championship season and the 2017–18 grand prix season, were tabulated to establish the ten top nations. Each nation compiled a score from their top performers in each of the four disciplines. The Grand Prix Final, taking place in early December 2017, was the final event to affect the Team Trophy score.\nQualification summary.\nTeam event.\nFinal standings.\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nIf a country rejects a quota spot then additional quotas become available. A country can be eligible for one quota spot per event in the reallocation process. Countries in bold indicate the country later received a quota spot. The following list is compiled after the remaining spots were allocated at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy."

        "title": "WrestleMania 36",
        "text": "WrestleMania 36 was the 36th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brand divisions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida and was broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5. This marked the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on tape delay. On pay-per-view, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a package deal. National Football League (NFL) player Rob Gronkowski served as the host of the event.\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida and was to air live. In mid-March, all WWE programming was relocated to the Performance Center training facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no audience and only essential staff present. WrestleMania 36 was the first major professional wrestling event to be affected by the pandemic, and is in turn the only edition of WrestleMania not to feature a live crowd. Taking advantage of the format, two cinematic matches—a \"Boneyard match\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\"—were filmed offsite in an atypical, cinematic style. In June, Florida lifted restrictions on paid spectator attendance at sporting events with the next year's WrestleMania 37 moved to Raymond James Stadium; WrestleMania 37, in turn, adopted much of the buccaneer-themed marketing originally used for WrestleMania 36, including a similar logo.\nThe card comprised 18 matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a dark match on the second night. In the main event of the show for Part 1, The Undertaker, partly returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" character for the first time in over 16 years, defeated AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was later revealed to be Undertaker's final match, while in the final match from the Performance Center, which was SmackDown's main match, Braun Strowman defeated Goldberg to win the Universal Championship. In other prominent matches, Becky Lynch defeated Shayna Baszler to retain the Raw Women's Championship, and Kevin Owens defeated Seth Rollins in a No Disqualification match. In the main event for Part 2, which was the main match for Raw, Drew McIntyre defeated Brock Lesnar to win the WWE Championship, after which an impromptu dark match occurred in which McIntyre retained the title against Big Show, which was shown on the April 6 episode of \"Raw\". In the penultimate match, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated John Cena in a Firefly Fun House match. In other prominent matches, Edge defeated Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match, which was Edge's first singles match since April 2011, and in the opening bout, Charlotte Flair defeated Rhea Ripley to win the NXT Women's Championship for a second time, which was the first and so far only time an NXT championship was defended at a WrestleMania.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania is ranked the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania.\nWrestleMania 36 was the fourth WrestleMania to be held in the state of Florida (after XXIV, XXVIII, and 33). The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, as well as NXT—although some NXT wrestlers had appeared in WrestleMania's previously annual battles royal, this was the first WrestleMania to promote the brand, following NXT becoming one of WWE's three major brands in September 2019. National Football League (NFL) player Rob Gronkowski, who had recently signed with WWE, was announced as the host of WrestleMania 36. Gronkowski last appeared for WWE during the WrestleMania 33 Kickoff pre-show in 2017.\nParts 1 and 2 of WrestleMania 36 were sold as individual pay-per-views, with both available as a package deal. For the first time, WWE announced that it would also offer the PPV as a digital purchase in the United States via FITE TV and the Fox Sports app (as an extension of Fox's broadcasts of \"SmackDown\"). ESPN, which does not normally air WWE programming, aired encores of previous editions of WrestleMania during the lead-up to the event to replace the NCAA women's basketball tournament that had been scrapped. \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd was the official theme song for the event.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnnounced on March 7, 2019, the event was originally scheduled to take place at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida solely on April 5, 2020, and was to air live. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, other wrestling promotions began to cancel or postpone their shows in an attempt to prevent further spreading of the COVID-19 virus. This became true after the National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its season after two of its players tested positive for COVID-19 which caused a massive ripple effect, effectively shutting down the vast majority of the sports world within five days. In speaking with the \"Tampa Bay Times\" regarding how this outbreak could affect WrestleMania 36, WWE's Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon said of this \"The health and safety of not only our fan base, but also our superstars, really does come first ... We don't want to put anyone in a bad situation ever, regardless of the circumstance. Those are not risks worth taking\". WWE's Executive Vice President of Special Events John Saboor further noted that they were constantly monitoring global events. A meeting was held by Tampa officials on March 12 to determine the fate of WrestleMania 36; it was decided that the event would still proceed as planned, barring that the situation did not worsen in a week's time. Hillsborough County Commissioner Les Miller further stated that if the situation was not any better by the following week, they would \"pull the plug\" on WrestleMania 36 if WWE did not do it themselves. WWE then stated that they had a contingency plan ready in case the event was canceled.\nOn March 16, WWE announced that the event would be held at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida with only essential personnel in attendance, as with all other WWE weekly programs during this pandemic. WWE then announced that WrestleMania 36 would be split into a two-night event, on April 4 and 5. The re-location effectively made it the third WrestleMania to be held in the city of Orlando, behind XXIV and 33. Many viewers also saw this as WWE taking an idea from New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)—who had their Wrestle Kingdom event on January 4 and 5 earlier in the year. Marketing of the event subsequently emphasized the change in format, with the new tagline \"Too Big for Just One Night\". WWE also produced a commemorative shirt reading \"I Wasn't There\", a spoof of their \"I Was There\" shirts of previous WrestleManias.\nIt was then reported by \"PWInsider\" that WWE were pre-recording several episodes of their weekly programs (with the exception of the live broadcast of the March 23 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\") for future broadcasts, as well as WrestleMania itself (marking the first WrestleMania to be pre-recorded rather than live), between March 21–26. WrestleMania tapings at the Performance Center were held between March 25 and 26. It was reported that WWE had filmed post-WrestleMania episodes of \"Raw\" and \"NXT\" after production wrapped on WrestleMania, before taking a two-week break.\nIn an interview with \"TV Guide\", WWE's Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy &amp; Development and part-time wrestler Triple H explained that the \"unique\", pre-recorded nature of the event gave them the opportunity to experiment with new production elements and settings (as opposed to being confined to the ring), such as the \"Boneyard\" and \"Firefly Fun House\" matches, which were done as cinematic matches. The Boneyard match was filmed at a custom-built set on location in the Orlando area (about a 40-minute drive away from the Performance Center), while the Firefly Fun House match segments were all taped at Titan Towers in Stamford, Connecticut, using props and set pieces from their storage facility. In lieu of a live performance of \"America the Beautiful\" to open the show as per tradition, a montage of performances of the song from past editions of WrestleMania was shown instead.\nChanges in participation.\nThe card underwent changes due to injuries and issues that arose related to the ongoing pandemic. Triple H confirmed that due to the circumstances, nothing would be held against any of the wrestlers who missed the event. He also stated that all of the talent competing were there in a voluntary capacity. For the first time since WrestleMania 23 in 2007, Triple H was not scheduled to compete at the event. However, this had already been planned before the changes in format and location brought about from the pandemic.\nWrestleMania's annual battles royal, the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal and WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal, were not scheduled to occur at WrestleMania 36 to limit the number of wrestlers in the ring at the same time. Roman Reigns, who was at an increased risk for COVID-19 due to being in an immunocompromised state from his previous struggles with leukemia, requested to be removed from his match against Goldberg and WWE honored the request; Braun Strowman was selected as Reigns' replacement in the match. Andrade, who was scheduled to team with Angel Garza to face The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) for the Raw Tag Team Championship, was removed from that match due to an injury and was replaced by NXT's Austin Theory. Additionally, it was reported that The Miz had contracted an illness and was pulled from the WrestleMania card; this turned the planned tag team triple threat Ladder match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship into a Triple Threat Ladder match between Jimmy Uso, Kofi Kingston, and defending champion John Morrison. Dana Brooke was originally advertised to be a part of the SmackDown Women's Championship elimination match, but she was taken off the card after reportedly being put into precautionary quarantine; Rey Mysterio was also reported to be in precautionary quarantine, but he had not been advertised for a match, though was reportedly going to face Andrade for the United States Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised a total of 19 matches divided across the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and one dark match on the second night. The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"Friday Night SmackDown\", and \"NXT\".\nMain event matches.\nFeeling as though nobody deserved an opportunity to challenge him at the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania, Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar decided to enter himself into the men's Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. Lesnar dominated the first half of the match until he was eventually eliminated by Raw's Drew McIntyre, who would go on and win the match, thus earning himself a world championship match of his choosing at WrestleMania. The next night on \"Raw\", McIntyre announced that he would challenge Lesnar for the WWE Championship at the event. At Super ShowDown, Lesnar retained the title against Ricochet, keeping him as the defending champion against McIntyre at WrestleMania.\nAt Super ShowDown, AJ Styles was a participant in the Tuwaiq Mountain Trophy gauntlet match. Final participant Rey Mysterio was ambushed backstage by Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, prompting Styles to declare himself the winner by forfeit. The referee gave Mysterio until the count of ten, during which, the camera cut backstage, showing that Gallows and Anderson had been attacked by The Undertaker, making a surprise return. Undertaker then made his entrance, taking Mysterio's place, and performed a Chokeslam on Styles to win the match and the trophy. On the following \"Raw\", a disgruntled Styles mocked Undertaker for still wrestling and issued a warning. The Undertaker then appeared at Elimination Chamber and cost Styles his No Disqualification match with Aleister Black. The following night on \"Raw\", Styles taunted Undertaker by bringing up his wife Michelle McCool, blaming her for why Undertaker keeps coming back to wrestle, while also calling Undertaker by his real name, Mark Calaway. Styles then challenged Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania. A contract signing for the match was conducted the following week. Styles then challenged Undertaker to a Boneyard match, and Undertaker accepted, cutting a promo akin to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick (circa 2000–2003).\nUndercard matches.\nAfter winning SmackDown's Universal Championship at Super ShowDown, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg appeared on the following night's episode of \"SmackDown\" and issued an open challenge by stating his catchphrase, \"Who's next?\" Roman Reigns interrupted and had a stare down with Goldberg before accepting his challenge, which was subsequently scheduled for WrestleMania. Just before the event, however, Reigns requested to be removed from the match for being at an increased risk for COVID-19, as he was in an immunocompromised state from his previous health issues with leukemia; Reigns himself confirmed the report and stated that WWE honored the request. Triple H also confirmed the report in a March 29 interview on ESPN's \"SportsCenter\". Five days later on the April 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", Braun Strowman was announced as Reigns' replacement in the match, making this the first WrestleMania since WrestleMania XXVIII where Reigns was not featured.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Raw's Charlotte Flair won the women's Royal Rumble match to earn herself a women's championship match of her choosing at WrestleMania. On the February 3 episode of \"Raw\", Flair stated that she had defeated the women's champions of both Raw and SmackDown and had held those titles multiple times. She was then interrupted by Rhea Ripley, the NXT Women's Champion—a title that Flair had only held once during NXT's infancy in 2014. Ripley declared that Flair should challenge her as she had defeated Flair, but Flair had never beat her. Flair continued to delay giving an answer until after Ripley had defended her title at on February 16. After Ripley retained her title at the NXT event, she was ambushed by Flair, who accepted Ripley's challenge for a match at WrestleMania, marking the first time that a Royal Rumble winner chose an NXT championship to challenge for with the title itself being the first NXT championship to be defended at the event.\nPrior to Survivor Series, a rivalry began between Raw's Becky Lynch and NXT's Shayna Baszler. At the event, Baszler won the non-title brand supremacy triple threat match between the three brands' women's champions by submitting SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley. An irate Lynch attacked Baszler following the match and put her through an announce table. After losing the NXT Women's Championship, Baszler appeared as the thirtieth entrant in the women's Royal Rumble match, finishing as the runner-up. Following Lynch's title defense on the February 10 episode of \"Raw\", Baszler ambushed Lynch and bit the back of her neck, thus reigniting their feud. Baszler was then entered into Raw's women's Elimination Chamber match at the namesake event where she single-handedly eliminated all of her opponents to win and earn herself a Raw Women's Championship match against Lynch at WrestleMania.\nJohn Cena, who had last appeared during \"Raw Reunion\" in July 2019, made his return from hiatus during the February 28, 2020, episode of \"SmackDown\" to address his role at WrestleMania. Seemingly announcing his retirement, Cena declared he would not be appearing at the event, stating that WrestleMania spots should be earned. As Cena gave a farewell salute to the audience from the stage, the lights went out. When they illuminated, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt appeared behind Cena. The Fiend then pointed to the WrestleMania sign, signaling a challenge to Cena, who simply nodded in acceptance. A match between the two was then scheduled for the event. This was the second the two fought each other at WrestleMania after WrestleMania XXX in April 2014. On the March 27 episode, Wyatt challenged Cena to a Firefly Fun House match, and Cena accepted.\nAfter being forced to retire in 2011 due to a severe neck injury, WWE Hall of Famer Edge returned at the 2020 Royal Rumble during the namesake match, where he had a brief reunion with Randy Orton; Edge eliminated Orton before his own elimination. On the following \"Raw\", Edge explained how he was able to make his return. Orton then welcomed Edge back and suggested reforming Rated-RKO, but turned on Edge and performed an RKO on him, thus turning heel in the process. After attacking Edge's neck with a steel chair, Orton smashed Edge's head between two steel chairs in a maneuver known as the \"Conchairto\", which Edge had made famous in the past. Edge's wife and fellow Hall of Famer Beth Phoenix appeared on the March 2 episode to give a medical update on her husband. Orton interrupted and said that he attacked Edge so that he would remain at home and continue his role as a husband and a father to their children. He then blamed Phoenix for the attack, claiming that she allowed Edge to get back in the ring. Phoenix slapped Orton, who in turn performed an RKO on her. Edge returned the following week on Montel Vontavious Porter's (MVP) talk show, the \"VIP Lounge\". Orton attempted to attack Edge, only for Edge to perform an RKO of his own on Orton. After Orton retreated, Edge performed the Conchairto on MVP twice as a warning to Orton. Edge then challenged Orton to a Last Man Standing match at WrestleMania, and Orton accepted.\nAt Survivor Series, Seth Rollins served as the captain of Team Raw for the men's Survivor Series elimination match, but questioned Kevin Owens' loyalty to the team due to Owens appearing at ; Raw suffered a devastating loss at Survivor Series, only winning one of the seven interbrand matches. Rollins criticized the Raw roster for their poor performance and again questioned Owens' loyalty, who responded by performing a Stunner on Rollins. Owens then became the target of AOP (Akam and Rezar). Although Owens accused Rollins of being behind AOP's attacks, Rollins denied the accusations, though he ultimately joined with AOP, turning heel. Rollins then began to refer to himself as the \"Monday Night Messiah\" and recruited Murphy into his new faction with AOP; Rollins and Murphy eventually won the Raw Tag Team Championship together. At the Royal Rumble, Rollins eliminated Owens from the namesake match thanks to help from AOP and Murphy. Rollins and Murphy lost their titles on an episode of \"Raw\", and during a rematch at Elimination Chamber, Owens cost them their match and performed a Stunner on Rollins afterward. The following night on \"Raw\", Rollins attacked Owens after an eight-man tag team match. On the March 16 episode, a match between Rollins and Owens was scheduled for WrestleMania.\nOn the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker) participated in an interbrand tag team battle royal that was won by Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode; the two teams entered into a feud following the event. Also during this time, Otis started a romance with Mandy Rose. On the February 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", Otis had a scheduled Valentine's Day date with Rose; however, Ziggler arrived first and stole the date, causing Otis to walk away heartbroken. On the March 6 episode, Otis apologized to Rose, who rejected the apology. Heavy Machinery then participated in the SmackDown Tag Team Championship Elimination Chamber match, where they were eliminated by Ziggler and Roode. On the March 20 episode of \"SmackDown\", Ziggler distracted Otis during his tag team match by showing pictures of him and Rose together, enraging Otis, which caused Heavy Machinery to get disqualified, thus costing them another title opportunity. Ziggler then challenged Otis to a match at WrestleMania and Otis accepted. On the final \"SmackDown\" before WrestleMania, a mysterious hacker (later revealed to be Mustafa Ali) appeared on the TitanTron during Ziggler's match with Tucker and revealed that Rose's Fire and Desire tag team partner Sonya Deville had conspired with Ziggler to sabotage Rose's Valentine's date with Otis.\nOn the March 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", King Corbin was interviewed backstage about his plans for WrestleMania 36, but was interrupted by Elias. The following week, Corbin lost his match after Elias played his guitar, causing a distraction. On the March 20 episode, Corbin interrupted WrestleMania host Rob Gronkowski, which brought out Elias to perform a song about Corbin. Elias then tossed Corbin from the ring, and Gronkowski advocated for a match between the two at WrestleMania 36, which was made official on March 23.\nEvent.\nPart 1.\nPre-show.\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 1 pre-show, Drew Gulak faced Cesaro. The climax saw Cesaro perform a \"U.F.O.\" on Gulak, followed by winning the match by pinfall.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with a special statement from Stephanie McMahon and a performance of \"America the Beautiful\", which was edited together from multiple performances of the song from previous WrestleMania events. Host Rob Gronkowski began hyping WrestleMania. He was joined by his friend Mojo Rawley.\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) defended the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. In the end, Cross performed the \"Purge\" on Sane followed by Bliss performing a \"Twisted Bliss\" to win and become the first two-time champions in the title's history.\nNext, Elias faced King Corbin. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pinfall; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the \"Kirifuda Clutch\" on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, Sami Zayn, accompanied by Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura, defended the Intercontinental Championship against Daniel Bryan (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted an aerial attack on Zayn, Zayn performed a \"Helluva Kick\" in mid-air to retain the title.\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the titles against The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), but due to the Miz falling ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors together, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the title belts, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the titles for himself and the Miz.\nAfterward, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via disqualification for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in an accepted No Disqualification match. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a \"Stunner\" on Rollins to win the match.\nIn a small segment, 24/7 Champion R-Truth joined Rob Gronkowski and Mojo Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title. However, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for a seventh time.\nIn the final match of Part 1 from the WWE Performance Center, Goldberg defended the WWE Universal Championship against Braun Strowman, who replaced Roman Reigns. After a stare down, Goldberg surprised Strowman with a kick on the stomach and a throw into a corner. Goldberg attempted a Spear on Strowman into the corner, but Strowman dodged it and Goldberg collided into the ring post. After Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam, Goldberg reversed it into three Spears for a nearfall. Then, Goldberg performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer, Strowman reversed it into three Front Powerslams and a Running Powerslam for a pinfall, winning his first WWE Universal Championship and the first world championship of his career.\nMain event.\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a Buried Alive match set at an undisclosed cemetery and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick) to the tune of Metallica's \"Now That We're Dead\". Early on, Undertaker would refer to Styles as \"Allen\" (Styles' real first name) as AJ tried getting away. Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids which were set up as a distraction by the O.C. so Styles could gain the upper hand again. Styles broke a shovel in half across The Undertaker's spine which caused him to fall into the grave. As Styles was preparing to fill the grave with dirt to win, Undertaker suddenly appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Both men fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse. When Styles backed off from Undertaker on the rooftop, scared and in disbelief about him rising from the grave, Undertaker raised his arms to make a wall of fire appear behind Styles, preventing Styles from running away. The O.C. then saw a chance to go for another attack on Undertaker, who struck back yet again. He threw Gallows off the roof, performed a \"Tombstone Piledriver\" on Anderson and chokeslammed Styles off the roof and through an old piece of wooden flooring. Undertaker then carried Styles over to the grave, where Styles begged him not to be buried. Undertaker brought him to his feet, embraced him, praised Styles for his efforts, and told him he would not bury him. However, Undertaker feigned walking away, as he turned back around and kicked Styles into the grave. Undertaker then started the tractor and dumped all the dirt into the grave, burying Styles to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song. This would be The Undertaker's final match at WrestleMania as well as in his career, cementing his final WrestleMania record at 25-2.\nPart 2.\nPre-show.\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match. This was Morgan's first WrestleMania win in her WWE run.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, after a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the \"Figure-Eight Leglock\" to win the title for her second time, and the first time since NXT TakeOver in May 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.\nNext, Aleister Black faced Bobby Lashley, accompanied by Lana. In the end, as Lashley attempted a spear on Black, Black performed a \"Black Mass\" on Lashley to win the match.\nAfterward, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the \"Caterpillar\" on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Mandy Rose then came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the \"Caterpillar\" on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton disguised as a cameraman attacked Edge from behind with an \"RKO\". Orton then attacked Edge with a second \"RKO\" and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck in the backstage area where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an \"RKO\" on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the \"Conchairto\" on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium that host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a springboard frog splash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked The Street Profits. NXT's Bianca Belair then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\" on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the \"Woman's Right\" on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the \"Woman's Right\" on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a backstabber on Evans. Bayley performed a \"Rose Plant\" on Evans to retain the title.\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of dream sequences where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on \"SmackDown\" (with Wyatt acting as Kurt Angle, and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"ruthless aggression\"), and a spoof of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old cult leader persona of The Wyatt Family, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at WrestleMania XXX, and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted \"Sister Abigail\" by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to \"nWo Monday Nitro\" — with Wyatt acting as Eric Bischoff, who introduced Cena, acting as \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed \"Sister Abigail\" and the \"Mandible Claw\" on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed \"Sister Abigail\", the audio of Cena's promo from \"SmackDown\" was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\". After the segment ended, a visibly shaken Titus O'Neil was shown on camera, uttering \"I don't know what I just saw.\"\nMain event.\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre hit Brock Lesnar with a \"Claymore\" on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an \"F-5\", but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more \"F-5s\", both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth \"F-5\", McIntyre countered and performed three more \"Claymores\" on Lesnar to win the match and title, capturing his first world championship in WWE and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first Triple Crown champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by Big Show, who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\" McIntyre performed a \"Claymore\" on Big Show to retain the title. This dark match aired on the April 6 episode of \"Raw\".\nReception.\nThe event was highly positively received by fans and received positive reviews from critics. While most argued that the event suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience (partly due to most of the wrestlers being removed from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including Roman Reigns, The Miz, Andrade, and Dana Brooke, who were all slated to defend or challenge for championships) many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor).\nThe male world title matches were also criticized for their short lengths and overuse of finishing moves.\nBrent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" gave the event a positive review, acknowledging that \"many fans were understandably hesitant to believe WWE could deliver a spectacle deserving of the WrestleMania title, but somehow the company pulled off the seemingly impossible by delivering two nights of compelling wrestling without tens of thousands of fans in attendance.\" He ranked the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best for Part 1 and 2, respectively, noting that in contrast to previous attempts by WWE to \"recreate Matt Hardy's 'Broken Universe' magic\", the first \"nailed the execution by striking the right balance between tense action and over-the-top presentation\", and the second was described as \"indie psychological horror movies brought to professional wrestling.\"\nRandall Colburn of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the event a B−. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium\". He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a PPV in Saudi Arabia—and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years\".\nDavid Bixenspan of \"Slate\" heavily criticized the lead-up to the event, stating that \"[The wrestlers], in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, looked significantly more like they were doing bad playacting and play-fighting than they usually do. Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. ... the WWE style—with its emphasis on overwrought capital–P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms—looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years\". However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward then comprised \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers\". \"Slate\" considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.\nAnthony Mango of \"Bleacher Report\" stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be\". He gave a positive review, although he ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event. Jake Rill, also of \"Bleacher Report\", gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.\nDespite having no attendance due to the circumstances, WrestleMania 36 was the most-viewed event in WWE history with a record 967 million views combining both nights across the company's digital and social platforms. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.\nAftermath.\nIn late-April, it was revealed that WrestleMania host Rob Gronkowski had come out of his NFL retirement, where he was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was later revealed that Gronkowski exercised a release clause in his WWE contract in order to return to the NFL, and he dropped the 24/7 Championship to R-Truth in a segment on the June 1 episode of \"Raw\". Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer noted that before his release, Gronkowski was scheduled to work a match at SummerSlam as well as WWE's Saudi Arabia show later in the year. He also said that the release was \"mutual\".\nIn May, a five-part documentary series about The Undertaker began airing on the WWE Network called \"Undertaker: The Last Ride\". The documentary series chronicles The Undertaker's career from 2017 to 2020 and his decision on when he should retire, which he previously believed was going to be his match with Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 33. In the final episode that released on June 21, Undertaker stated that he had nothing left to prove and had no desire to step in the ring again, feeling that his match with AJ Styles was the perfect ending to his 30-year career, thus making his WrestleMania 36 match with Styles his final match. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a potential one-off match, depending on the situation. Undertaker also revealed that he did not make a full return to his American Bad Ass gimmick at WrestleMania 36. Instead, it was a combination of his Deadman persona, the American Bad Ass, as well as his real life self; the latter due to how personal Styles' promos were against Undertaker. The Undertaker's official retirement ceremony later occurred at Survivor Series on November 22, which also celebrated the 30th anniversary of his debut in WWE, which occurred at the 1990 Survivor Series.\nRaw.\nThe following night's episode of \"Raw\" showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler regarding their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again. The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's Money in the Bank ladder match.\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Austin Theory and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega) in a rematch for the titles where the champions retained once again, though by disqualification, thanks to Vega. Bianca Belair again came out after the match, and challenged Vega to a match which ended in a no-contest. A six-person mixed tag team match ensued with The Street Profits and Belair defeating Theory, Garza, and Vega.\nCharlotte Flair boasted about defeating Rhea Ripley and becoming a two-time NXT Women's Champion, though said that Ripley was \"okay\". Ripley returned on the May 6 episode of \"NXT\" to save Io Shirai from a post-match beat down after Flair had retained the title against Shirai due to disqualification. This ultimately set up a triple threat match between the three women at .\nOn the April 13 episode, Seth Rollins stated that by losing to Kevin Owens at WrestleMania, he had been crucified and now he had truly risen (buying into his \"Monday Night Messiah\" gimmick). He later attacked WWE Champion Drew McIntyre following the latter's match with Andrade. He subsequently set up a title match for Money in the Bank.\nOn the May 11 episode of \"Raw\", both Edge and Randy Orton made their first post-WrestleMania appearances. Orton stated that at WrestleMania, the better man won but questioned whether or not the better wrestler had actually won. Noting that the Royal Rumble and Last Man Standing matches were non-traditional matches, Orton challenged Edge to a normal singles match at Backlash, which Orton won. During the match, Edge legitimately tore his triceps. After recovering from his triceps tear, Edge returned at the 2021 Royal Rumble, where he and Orton entered at number one and two, respectively. The two brawled at ringside, and Edge injured Orton's leg, taking Orton out for the majority of the match. Orton returned in the closing moments of the match where he attempted to eliminate Edge, however, Edge countered and eliminated Orton to win the men's Royal Rumble match. Orton then faced Edge in a rubber match the following night on \"Raw\", where thanks to a distraction by Alexa Bliss (as part of a storyline between Orton, Bliss, and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt), Edge defeated Orton, putting an end to their rivalry.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Bray Wyatt interrupted new Universal Champion Braun Strowman after the latter's match. Wyatt reminded Strowman that it was he who brought him to WWE with his old Wyatt Family stable. Wyatt, who had lost the title to Goldberg at Super ShowDown, then stated he wanted his title back and Strowman accepted the challenge, which was scheduled for Money in the Bank, though against Wyatt's normal self instead of The Fiend.\nAlso on the following \"SmackDown\", Tamina pointed out the fact that Bayley nor any other competitor in the fatal five-way elimination match actually beat her and challenged Bayley to a singles match for the SmackDown Women's Championship. Bayley agreed if Tamina could defeat her friend Sasha Banks, which Tamina subsequently done the following week to earn the title match at Money in the Bank. On the April 24 episode, Evans defeated Banks to qualify for the women's Money in the Bank ladder match due to an untimely assist from Bayley. The following week, Tamina's backstage interview was interrupted by Banks, and she and Bayley attacked her until Evans made the save. On the May 8 episode, Evans and Tamina defeated Banks and Bayley with Tamina pinning Bayley.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", new WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross retained their titles in a rematch against The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane). Since only one member of each team competed for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania, The New Day's Big E suggested that the other team members should face off in a triple threat match for the titles. The match occurred the following week, in which Big E defeated Jey Uso and The Miz to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship for a record eighth time for The New Day.\nAlso on the following \"SmackDown\", Heavy Machinery's Tucker faced Dolph Ziggler in a rematch from the \"SmackDown\" prior to WrestleMania in a losing effort; Otis and Mandy Rose were absent that night. The following week, Sonya Deville called out Rose to clear the air between them. An emotional Deville stated that Rose was the most selfish person she had met. Deville also stated that she was the better wrestler and Rose was nothing more than eye candy. Ziggler then came out and stated to Rose that she could not deny the chemistry between them. Deville attacked Rose, which prompted Otis to come out and attack Ziggler. On the May 1 episode, Otis defeated Ziggler again to qualify for the men's Money in the Bank ladder match. Also that same episode, Rose lost her Money in the Bank qualifying match due to a distraction from Deville, who attacked Rose after the match. The following week, Deville defeated Rose. Rose and Deville would continue feuding until SummerSlam, where Rose defeated Deville in a no disqualification loser leaves WWE match.\nElias sang a song about his win over King Corbin at WrestleMania 36. The following week, Elias was about to make another performance, but was viciously attacked by Corbin, who bashed the guitar on Elias' back. Elias returned at Money in the Bank, where he cost Corbin the men's Money in the Bank ladder match. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Corbin defeated Elias in a WrestleMania rematch to advance in the tournament for the vacant Intercontinental Championship.\nIt would be two years before Roman Reigns and Goldberg would have their originally scheduled match for the Universal Championship. Reigns made his return at the 2020 SummerSlam and won the title at Payback. Reigns remained champion for over the next year and into 2022. In February 2022, Goldberg confronted Reigns and set up a match between the two for the title at Elimination Chamber. At the event, Reigns defeated Goldberg to retain the title.\nFurther effects of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had further effects on WWE following WrestleMania. \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", \"205 Live\", and pay-per-views continued to be broadcast from the Performance Center until August before relocating to Orlando's Amway Center with a new virtual fan viewing experience called ThunderDome—they then moved to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida in December and then Yuengling Center in Tampa in April 2021. Mid-year, \"205 Live\" began doing their tapings in conjunction with NXT. Broadcasts of \"NXT\" were done from its home base of Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida until October when NXT was relocated to the Performance Center, rebranded as the Capitol Wrestling Center, NXT's version of the ThunderDome and an homage to WWE's predecessor, the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. Furthermore, WWE released several talent due to budget cuts as a result of the pandemic. These included Hall of Famer Kurt Angle, Rusev, Drake Maverick, Zack Ryder, Curt Hawkins, Karl Anderson, Luke Gallows, Heath Slater, Eric Young, Rowan, Sarah Logan, No Way Jose, Mike Chioda, Mike Kanellis, Maria Kanellis, EC3, Aiden English, Lio Rush, The Colóns (Primo and Epico), and Cain Velasquez, and many other behind-the-scenes employees. However, following his loss in the final of the interim NXT Cruiserweight Championship tournament, Maverick re-signed with the company, and it was reported that WWE had reached out to some of the other released talent, though for lower pay than their previous contracts.\nWhile WrestleMania 37 was initially announced for SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in October 2020, the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that WWE would consider relocating the event to Raymond James Stadium in order to allow for in-person attendance at a reduced capacity, which was not possible under California's health orders; Florida lifted those restrictions in late-August 2020. WWE officially announced the move on January 16, 2021, and it was the first WWE event to have ticketed fans in attendance during the pandemic with a limited capacity of 25,000 spectators for each night and with COVID-19 safety protocols in place. WWE then returned to live touring in mid-July."

        "text": "Luke Douglas Kennard (born June 24, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils and was drafted by the Detroit Pistons with the 12th pick in the 2017 NBA draft. He has also played for the Los Angeles Clippers.\nHigh school career.\nKennard attended Franklin High School in Franklin, Ohio near Dayton. As a senior, he was named the \"Parade\" National Player of the Year. He was named the Ohio Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year as junior and senior. He also played high school football, lettering for three years as a quarterback. And though he shot with his left hand in basketball, he threw with his right hand in football.\nFinishing high school, Kennard was one of the most sought after recruits in the nation. He was ranked as the No. 24 prospect in his recruiting class by ESPN. Kennard committed to Duke University to play college basketball during his junior year of high school. He finished his career with the second most points in Ohio history, three spots ahead of LeBron James. He was a McDonald's All-American selection.\nIn 2020, it was announced that Franklin High would retire Kennard's number 10.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season (2015–2016).\nIn practice, he frequently matched up against Duke guard Grayson Allen.\nOn January 6, 2016, Luke scored 23 points in a 91–75 win over Wake Forest.

He led the team both from the three-point range with 43.8% and free throw line at 85.6%. As a sophomore, he was named first team All-ACC and second-team All-American.\nHe finished 1–6 from the field and fouled out in Duke's second-round loss to South Carolina in the NCAA tournament. His reaction to the final foul call against him quickly turned into a meme.\nAfter his sophomore season, Kennard chose to forgo his final two years of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2017 NBA draft. He joined Duke teammates Jayson Tatum, Harry Giles, and Frank Jackson in declaring early for the draft.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Pistons (2017–2020).\nOn June 22, 2017, Kennard was drafted 12th overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2017 NBA draft.\nHe made his NBA debut on October 20, 2017, against the Washington Wizards, scoring 11 points and recording 2 steals in 18 minutes.

Kennard missed the Clippers’ two postseason play-in tournament games with a hamstring injury, as they were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 2018.\nMemphis Grizzlies (2023–present).\nOn February 9, 2023, Kennard was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team trade involving the Houston Rockets. He made his Grizzlies debut three days later, recording four points and two rebounds in a 119–109 loss to the Boston Celtics. On March 24, Kennard scored a career-high tying 30 points in a 151–114 win over the Houston Rockets. His ten made 3-pointers set a Grizzlies franchise record for most threes made in a game, surpassing the previous mark (9) set twice by Mike Miller and once by current teammate Jaren Jackson Jr.\nPersonal life.\nKennard briefly dated reality TV star Savannah Chrisley. Kennard later began dating Anna Castro, proposing on October 17, 2021. They were married on August 5, 2022."

While Miller would not coach their next game that day against Oregon, Arizona allowed Ayton to play.

However, as a consequence of the report involving Ayton, both of Arizona's remaining committed recruits from the class of 2018, Shareef O'Neal and Brandon Williams, announced they had decommitted.\nPersonnel.\nRoster.\n \nPreseason.\nSummer Exhibition Tour.\nPractices began earlier than otherwise allowed by the NCAA in preparation for a three-game foreign tour to Spain in August.

        "title": "Kevin Rooney (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Kevin Rooney (born May 21, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey center for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nGrowing up in Canton, Massachusetts, Rooney won two state championships at two different high schools. He first won a Division 2 State championship with the Canton High School Bulldogs before transferring to Berkshire School and winning the 2012 NEPSAC Martin/Earl tournament. After going undrafted into the National Hockey League's Entry Draft, Rooney played four seasons with Providence College from 2012 to 2016. Following his senior year, Rooney signed a professional contract with the Albany Devils of the American Hockey League.\nPersonal life.\nRooney was born on May 21, 1993, in Canton, Massachusetts, to parents Dave and Dawn Rooney. Dave and his brother Steve both played ice hockey at Canton High School, a school that Rooney and his brother Bryan would later attend. Beyond his father, Rooney's cousins Joe and Chris played NCAA college ice hockey while his uncle Steve won a Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens.\nPlaying career.\nGrowing up in Canton, Rooney played alongside his older brother Bryan at Canton High School for the Canton Bulldogs in the Hockomock League. As a sophomore, Rooney scored an empty-net goal in the Division 2 State championship to lead the Bulldogs to a 2010 title. After winning a state championship in 2010, Rooney transferred to the Berkshire School where he played hockey and baseball. Although he was eligible for graduation in 2011, Rooney chose to repeat his junior year at the Berkshire School. In his final year with the Berkshire Bears, he helped them defeat St. Sebastian's in overtime to claim the 2012 NEPSAC Martin/Earl tournament championship title. Over his two years at Berkshire, Rooney totalled 58 points and earned MVP honors in the Large School playoffs. Prior to graduating from Berkshire, Rooney committed to attend Providence College.\nCollegiate.\nAfter going undrafted into the National Hockey League (NHL), Rooney was a walk-on freshman with the Providence College Friars of the Hockey East conference. He played with the Friars for four years from 2012 to 2016 while majoring in finance. As a freshman, Rooney was a fourth-line winger for the Friars while his cousin Chris, who was a senior, was a second-line winger. Rooney played in 29 games for the Friars during the 2012–13 season after making his NCAA debut on October 12 against Sacred Heart. He scored his first collegiate goal during the Friars Hockey East Semifinals loss to the UMass-Lowell River Hawks on March 22, 2014. He finished his freshman campaign with one goal and three assists for four points.\nRooney missed the beginning of the 2013–14 season due to a preseason injury but recorded an assist in his season debut against the Miami RedHawks on October 25. Unlike in his freshman season, Rooney played the majority of the 2013–14 season as the Friars fourth-line center. In this new role, he helped the Friars qualify for the Hockey East Semifinals against the fourth-seeded New Hampshire Wildcats and scored the team's only goal in their 3–1 loss. He finished the season with a career-high three goals and four assists for seven points. At the conclusion of his sophomore season, Rooney was invited to participate in the New York Rangers Development Camp as a free agent.\nUpon returning to Providence following the Rangers Development Camp, Rooney and the Friars went 4–5–1 through their first 10 games of the 2014–15 season. In his junior season, Rooney developed into a shutdown forward role while alternating between third- or fourth-line center. His advanced role in the Friars lineup allowed him to tally a career-high seven goals and eight assists for 15 points to help the Friars qualify for the 2015 NCAA tournament. As a result of their lacklustre start to the season, the Friars only qualified for the 2015 NCAA tournament after Minnesota beat Michigan in the Big Ten Championship. During the Frozen Four, Rooney assisted on a goal in Providence's 4–1 win over Omaha to help them advance to their first National Championships since 1985. Rooney and the Friars then faced off against Jack Eichel and the Boston University Terriers in the National Championship. Rooney helped the Friars neutralize the Terrier's top line to lead the Friars to their first National Championship Title in program history. At the Friars end of season banquet, Rooney received the team's Unsung Hero Award. He was also named to Hockey East's All-Academic Team for achieving a GPA of 3.0 or better.\nRooney returned to the Friars as team co-captains alongside Tom Parisi for the 2015–16 season. In this role, he recorded four goals and six assists for 10 points through 38 games.\nNew Jersey Devils organization.\nOn March 29, 2016, Rooney concluded his senior year at Providence by signing an amateur try-out agreement with the Albany Devils of the American Hockey League (AHL). While he was offered contracts with other teams, Rooney said he chose the Devils because it was a well-established organization. He played in the final seven regular season games for the Devils, collecting three assists. On July 5, Rooney opted to continue with the Albany Devils and signed a one-year contract extension.\nRooney started the 2016–17 season, his first full season with the Devils, strong by tallying five goals over 19 games. By February 2017, Rooney led all Albany skaters and all AHL rookies with 57 games played. He had also collected 10 goals and seven assists for 17 points and 39 penalty minutes. On February 27, Rooney signed a one-year entry-level contract with the Albany Devils parent club, the New Jersey Devils. A few days later, Rooney was called up to New Jersey and made his NHL debut in a 1–0 loss to the Washington Capitals on March 2. Rooney played 9:48 in his NHL debut and recorded one blocked shot, a hit, and was 60% effective in the faceoff circle. He played three games with the Devils before being returned to the AHL for one game on March 7. He was recalled again to the NHL level on March 9 for one game. Upon being returned back to the AHL following his fourth game, Rooney was advised to improve on his strength and speed. Rooney finished the regular season in the AHL with 13 goals and eight assists for 21 points and 39 penalty minutes. When the Devils qualified for the 2017 Calder Cup playoffs, he tallied one goal through four contests as the Devils were swept in the first round.\nOn July 26, 2017, the Devils re-signed Rooney to a one-year, two-way contract worth $650,000 at the NHL level. After participating in the Devils training camp, he was re-assigned to the AHL prior to the start of the 2017–18 season. Less than 24 hours later, Rooney was recalled to the NHL as a potential replacement for Travis Zajac and Brian Boyle. He played one preseason game on the Devils fourth line with Jimmy Vesey and Miles Wood before being returned to the Binghamton Devils in the AHL. Rooney tallied nine goals and nine assists through 41 games before earning his first regular season recall on January 24. He played 11:05 minutes of ice time the following night against the Nashville Predators. However, the recall was short-lived and he was sent back down the next day. Rooney finished his second full AHL season with 14 goals and 20 assists for 34 points through 71 games. While the Devils were competing in the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, Rooney was one of seven players from Binghamton recalled as support for their first-round series.\nOn August 13, 2018, Rooney signed a two-year contract extension with the Devils. The first year was a two-way contract, allowing him to move between the AHL and NHL. The second year of the contract was one-way worth $700,000 at the NHL level. While he was originally returned to the AHL to start the 2018–19 season, Rooney was recalled back to the NHL on October 20 and played in four games. Upon rejoining the Binghamton Devils, Rooney was named team captain on November 20, 2018. He remained in Binghamton until January 10 when he was recalled to the NHL level. While in Binghamton, Rooney had played 34 games with one goal and 16 assists. Four days later, Rooney recorded his first career NHL goal in an 8–5 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. Rooney remained with the Devils for the rest of the season, playing in a mostly depth role on the third and fourth lines. He also experienced both goalless droughts and goal-scoring stretches. After experiencing a nine-game goalless drought in March, Rooney recovered and scored four goals and six points over the next nine games. He finished the season with six goals and four assists for 10 points through 41 games.\nAfter participating in the Devils 2019 training camp, Rooney was named to the Devil's opening night roster for the 2019–20 season. Rooney and the Devils struggled at the start of the season despite hopes of improvement with the additions of Jack Hughes and P. K. Subban. As the Devils began the season with an 0–4-2 record, Rooney's place in the Devils lineup was inconsistent due to an early season injury to his hand. He suffered an injury on November 13 and missed seven games before returning to the lineup on November 30. As the Devils continued to struggle to win games, head coach John Hynes and general manager Ray Shero were both fired. At the time of Shero's firing in January, the Devils had maintained a losing 17–21–7 record and were last place in the Metropolitan Division. Following the NHL's All-Star break, the Devils went six games without experiencing a regulation loss. Interim head coach Alain Nasreddine praised the chemistry between Rooney and John Hayden on the fourth line as part of the reason for the team's success. Through the six games, Rooney had tallied four points and was tied for second on the team with a plus +4 rating. When the NHL paused play due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rooney had skated in a career-high 49 NHL games while tallying posting four goals and five assists.\nNew York Rangers.\nAfter four seasons within the Devils organization, Rooney left as a free agent to sign a two-year, $1.5 million contract with the New York Rangers on October 9, 2020. \nRooney began the 2021–22 season strong by recording his first career multi-goal game on November 24, 2021, against the New York Islanders to add his fourth and fifth goals of the season. He quickly followed this up with another multi-point game on December 7 to rank third on the Rangers with six goals. However, this would prove to be his last point of the month as he did not add to his point total until January 8 against the Anaheim Ducks when he recorded two assists. He continued to remain goalless until February 24 when he recorded his seventh goal of the season against the Washington Capitals. Although he had broken his previous drought, Rooney did not tally another point again until April 27 again against the Capitals. Part of this reason was because after playing in his 200th career NHL game on March 2 against the St. Louis Blues, Rooney was placed on injured reserve and listed as 'week-to-week'. He missed 15 games before returning to the Rangers lineup on April 9 and helped them clinch a spot in the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs. When the Rangers faced off against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, Rooney was one of nine Rangers players to make their postseason debut in Game 1. During this series, Rooney tallied his first two career postseason assists as the Rangers beat the Penguins in seven games.\nCalgary Flames organization.\nOn July 13, 2022, Rooney left the Rangers as a free agent and signed a two-year $2.6 million contract with the Calgary Flames. After playing in 17 games for the Flames and recording one point, Rooney was reassigned to their AHL affiliate, the Calgary Wranglers. Rooney made an immediate impact with the Wranglers once joining the team, scoring an assist in his season debut against the San Diego Gulls. He later scored his first goal with the Wranglers during teammate Brett Sutter's 1,000th AHL game on December 21. Rooney remained with the Wranglers for the rest of the 2022–23 season and finished with five goals and 12 assists for 17 points through 51 games. His efforts also helped the Wranglers win the Kilpatrick Trophy as the AHL’s regular season champions. Throughout most of the regular season ansd the playoffs, Rooney often played on a veteran line with Brett Sutter and Clark Bishop. During the 2023 offseason, Rooney underwent shoulder surgery and was expected to be out long-term.\nOn March 8, 2024, Rooney signed a one-year, $1.3 million contract extension with the Flames."

        "text": "The 2019 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament was the national championship tournament for men's college ice hockey in the United States. The tournament involved 16 teams in single-elimination play to determine the national champion at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the highest level of competition in college hockey. The tournament's Frozen Four – the semifinals and finals – were hosted by the MAAC at the KeyBank Center in Buffalo, New York from April 11–13, 2019. This was the second Frozen Four in the city of Buffalo, as it previously hosted in 2003.\nThis was the first championship since 2007 to have multiple programs make their first NCAA tournament appearance (American International and Arizona State).\nBowling Green State University made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 29 years, while for the first time since 1992 an Independent program (Arizona State) made the tournament.\nThe tournament is as remembered for the lack of attendance as anything that happened on the ice. All semifinal and championship games had at least 5,000 fewer spectators than the building capacity (19,070) and the title game saw the lowest attendance since 2000. Though there was much discussion on the matter, a general consensus by fan bases was that the ticket prices of $200–$300 were far too high even for a championship game.\nTournament procedure.\nThe tournament is composed of four groups of four teams in regional brackets. The four regionals are officially named after their geographic areas. The following are the sites for the 2019 regionals:\nThe winner of each regional will advance to the Frozen Four:\nQualifying teams.\nThe at-large bids and seeding for each team in the tournament were announced on March 24. Teams were seeded according to their PairWise rankings (PWR) 1 thru 16 then matchups were adjusted to prevent teams from the same conference meeting in the first round. After the four groups were decided they were placed in regions as close, geographically, to the top seed as possible. The ECAC Hockey had four teams receive a berth in the tournament, the NCHC and Hockey East each had three teams receive a berth, the WCHA and Big Ten had two teams receive a berth, while one team from Atlantic Hockey received a berth. For the first time since 1992 an independent program, Arizona State, also received a tournament berth.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament for the fifteenth consecutive year. ESPN aired every game, beginning with the regionals, on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, and ESPN3, which were streamed online via WatchESPN.\nIn Canada, the tournament was broadcast by TSN and streamed on TSN Go.\nIn the UK, the tournament was broadcast by BT Sport ESPN.\nBroadcast assignments.\n\"Regionals\"\n\"Frozen Four\"\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the Frozen Four and broadcast both the semifinals and the championship."

Bjork's first NHL goal came in the fourth game of the season on the road against the Arizona Coyotes, as the final goal of a 6–2 road win for the Bruins.\nOn January 30, 2018, during a home-ice game against the visiting Anaheim Ducks, Bjork suffered a season-ending left shoulder injury – he underwent a successful arthroscopy and labral repair three weeks later, and was expected to take six months to fully heal from the surgical repair.\nBuffalo Sabres.\nIn the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, Bjork collected 2 goals and 5 points through 30 regular season games before he was dealt by the Bruins on the eve of the trade deadline along with a 2021 second-round draft pick to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Taylor Hall and Curtis Lazar on April 11, 2021.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nIn the final year of his contract, on March 2, 2023, on the eve of that season's trade deadline, Bjork was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for future considerations.

He played at representative level for New South Wales, and at club level for the Newtown Bluebags and Hull FC, as a , i.e. number 2 or 5.\nPlaying career.\nNewtown.\nFrank Hurley attended Sydney Boys High and played Rugby Union for the school and represented GPS.\nAfter leaving school he joined Drummoyne Rugby Union Club and played 1st Grade. He trailed for Newtown in 1935 and was offered a contract.\nHurley played for Newtown and in 1936 was selected to play for New South Wales.\nHurley played left-wing, i.e. number 5, in New South Wales' 30-13 victory over Queensland in the 1936 Interstate rugby league series at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 16 May 1936, in front of a crowd of 36,021. He also played in their 24-13 victory over Queensland on Saturday 23 May, in front of a crowd of 27,539, and then played in the 18-14 victory over Great Britain during the Lions tour on Saturday 6 June 1936, in front of a crowd of 49,519.\nHull.\nOn Tuesday 23 February 1937, the Mayor of Newtown, Alderman Fred Newnham, a solicitor, presided over a farewell ceremony for Hurley at Newtown Town Hall, and speeches expressing good wishes were made by aldermen of Newtown, and officials of the Newtown Bluebags. On Wednesday 24 February 1937, Hurley left Australia bound for England to play for Hull F.C.\nHe became the first overseas player to score a hat-trick of tries for Hull F.C. in the Hull Kingston Rovers derby match. Only two other overseas players have since equalled this feat; Tevita Vaikona and Fetuli Talanoa.\nHurley played right-wing, i.e. number 2, in Hull's 10-18 defeat by Huddersfield in the 1938 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1938–39 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 22 October 1938, in front of a crowd of 28,714.\nReturn to Australia and later years.\nHurley had hoped to play for Hull for four years, however the start of World War II on 1 September 1939 curtailed his stay in England and, upon his return to Australia, he rejoined Newtown playing briefly during the 1940 NSWRFL season. He then returned to Britain to serve with No. 10 Squadron RAAF of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) until the end of World War II in 1945. He died after a short illness in 1992, 16 days short of his 77th birthday."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2017 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2017 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn March 2, 2017, the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced the 2017 Academic All-America team, with Canyon Barry (youngest son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry) headlining the NCAA Division I team as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year. The following is the 2016–17 Academic All-America Division I Men’s Basketball Team as selected by CoSIDA:\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are called Senior All-Americans.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a right fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a fly out), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. The right fielder (RF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. The right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders must try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The right fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of the right field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder farthest from third base, the right fielder often has to make longer throws than the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often have the strongest or most accurate throwing arm. The right fielder normally plays behind the second baseman and first baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, right fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9, the highest number.\nThe overwhelming majority of putouts recorded by right fielders, almost to exclusivity, result from catching fly balls. However, in extraordinary circumstances, an outfielder may record a putout by receiving a throw to force out or tag out a runner while covering a base if one or more infielders are out of position to retrieve an errant throw, or by tagging a runner stranded between bases in a rundown play; however, even in such circumstances, outfielders will more typically act as a backup to infielders than cover a base themselves. Historically, putout totals for outfielders rose after 1920 with the end of the dead-ball era; the same circumstances which had kept home run totals low, such as overused baseballs and legal adulterations including the spitball, had similarly hindered the type of power hitting which lent itself to long fly balls. As strikeout totals have risen in baseball in recent decades, the frequency of other defensive outs including flyouts has declined; as a result, putout totals for outfielders have generally declined, but right fielders have largely defied this trend. Eight of the top nine players, and 17 of the top 20, were active entirely after 1950. Through the 2022 season, none of the top 251 single-season right field putout totals were recorded before 1920, and only 45 were recorded before 1960; nine of the top twelve, and 40 of the top 79, have been recorded since 1996.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate putout totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Because they are expected to cover more territory in the outfield than their counterparts on either side, often being the fastest player of the three, center fielders typically records the highest putout totals; left fielders usually records slightly more putouts than right fielders due to the ball being more frequently hit to the left side of the field. Paul Waner is the all-time leader in career putouts by a right fielder with 4,533. Roberto Clemente (4,459), Dwight Evans (4,247), Hank Aaron (4,161), Tony Gwynn (4,052), Nick Markakis (4,025), Sammy Sosa (4,017), and Ichiro Suzuki (4,005) are the only other right fielders to record over 4,000 career putouts."

        "text": "Bill Johnston (born 17 February 1997) is an Irish rugby union player for English RFU Championship club Richmond. He plays as a fly-half and previously represented his native province of Munster, their provincial rivals Ulster, English club Ealing and, in the amateur All-Ireland League, Limerick club Garryowen.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Johnston first began playing rugby aged 6 with Clonmel. He won the 2015 Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup with Rockwell College, leading the side from fly-half in their 23–13 victory against Ardscoil Rís.\nProfessional career.\nMunster.\nJohnston joined the Munster Academy in November 2015. On 13 November 2015, Johnston made his debut for Munster A, starting for the side alongside his brother, David, in their 27–25 defeat at the hands of London Scottish in their 2015–16 British and Irish Cup pool opener and scoring a penalty on his debut.\nHe scored 8 points, all from conversions, in Munster A's 28–8 victory against Ospreys Premiership Select in Round 3 of the tournament on 11 December 2015. 9 days later, Johnston scored 16 points off the tee as Munster A again beat Ospreys Premiership Select, this time 46–26 away from home in Brewery Field. On 10 December 2016, Johnston scored 10 points, all from the tee, as Munster A beat Rotherham Titans 35–24 away from home in Clifton Lane in Round 3 of the 2016–17 British and Irish Cup. In December 2016, Johnston was ruled out for 8–12 weeks with an ankle injury.\nJohnston made his competitive senior debut for Munster when he came off the bench as a replacement for Tyler Bleyendaal in the 50–14 away win against Zebre in a 2016–17 Pro12 fixture in the Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi, Parma on 25 March 2017. Johnston had been a late call-up to the Munster bench after his older brother, David, replaced the injured Andrew Conway in the starting line-up. On 31 March 2017, Johnston started for Munster A in their 2016–17 British and Irish Cup semi-final against Ealing Trailfinders. Munster A won the game 25–9, but Johnston went off injured during the first half and it was later confirmed that he had fractured his fibula.\nJohnston was promoted to the senior Munster squad ahead of the 2017–18 season. He signed a two-year contract with Munster in April 2018. In his first Pro14 start for Munster, made during round 8 of the 2018–19 season against South African side Cheetahs on 4 November 2018, Johnston scored two conversions and one penalty in his sides 30–26 away victory.\nUlster.\nJohnston joined Munster's provincial rivals Ulster ahead of the 2019–20 season. He made his debut for the province in their 63–26 defeat away to South African side Cheetahs in round 2 of the 2019–20 Pro14 on 5 October 2019.\nEaling.\nJohnston joined English RFU Championship club Ealing Trailfinders on loan in April 2021, where his older brother David is also a player. The move was made permanent ahead of the 2021–22 season.\nRichmond.\nJohnston moved south to join another London-based RFU Championship club, Richmond, ahead of the 2022–23 season.\nIreland.\nJohnston was selected in the Ireland U20 squad for the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship when it was announced in May 2016. This was his first call-up to the Under-20s team, having previously represented Ireland at U18 level. On 7 June 2016, Johnston made his debut for the side when he started in Ireland's opening pool fixture against Wales U20, scoring 11 points in his sides comeback 26–25 victory, having one point trailed the Welsh by 17 points. \nHe again started on 11 June, this time against New Zealand U20. He contributed 10 points in Ireland's historic 33–24 win against New Zealand U20, the sides first against their U20 rivals, but had to leave the field with a dislocated shoulder late in the first-half. Subsequently, the injury ruled him out for the rest of the tournament. On 24 February 2017, Johnston made his first appearance in the 2017 Six Nations Under 20 Championship, replacing the injured Jonny McPhillips and starting against France U20. Johnston scored 12 points in his sides 27–22 victory in Donnybrook Stadium. On 11 March 2017, Johnston again started for Ireland U20, this time against Wales U20 at the Eirias Stadium. Johnston scored 12 points off the tee for his side, including 3 conversions, but it was not enough to prevent Wales winning 41–27. On 17 March 2017, Johnston started and scored 5 points from the tee in Ireland U20's 14–10 defeat against England U20."

        "text": "Steven Theodore Barnes (born June 22, 1957) is an American basketball coach who last served as the associate head coach at Colorado State University.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Frankfurt, Germany, Barnes grew up in North Carolina before moving to Arcadia, California and graduating from Arcadia High School in 1975. Barnes first played junior college basketball at Citrus College before transferring to Chico State in 1977. After playing his final year of eligibility at Azusa Pacific in the 1979–80 season, Barnes completed his bachelor's degree at Azusa Pacific in 1985 after several years of working as a coach.\nCoaching career.\nFrom 1978 to 1981, Barnes was an assistant coach at his Alma mater, Arcadia High School. Subsequently, he was an assistant coach at Azusa Pacific from 1981 to 1983, assistant coach at Capistrano Valley Christian School from 1983 to 1984, and head coach at that school from 1984 to 1985.\nBarnes then was an assistant coach from 1985 to 1987 at Saddleback College, a junior college in Southern California. He then was an assistant at Cal Poly in the 1987–88 season.\nIn 1988, Barnes became an assistant coach at Idaho under Kermit Davis and helped Idaho make the NCAA Tournaments of 1989 and 1990. Barnes remained on staff when his former high school teammate Larry Eustachy became head coach in 1990 and started one of several stints as an assistant under Eustachy. Barnes then followed Eustachy to Utah State before joining Pat Douglass' staff at Cal State Bakersfield in 1994. Barnes recruited Kebu Stewart to Cal State Bakersfield, and Stewart became a first-team Division II All-American in 1996.\nReuniting with Eustachy, Barnes returned to Utah State after two seasons at Cal State Bakersfield, this time as associate head coach from 1996 to 1998. Barnes also served on Eustachy's inaugural staff at Iowa State as associate head coach in the 1998–99 season.\nBarnes got his first college head coaching job at San Jose State on August 27, 1999. Barnes went 29–29 in his first two seasons, both of which had exact .500 records, including 14–14 in 2000–01. However, San Jose State dropped to 10–22 in 2001–02. On April 29, 2002, Barnes resigned from San Jose State to return to Iowa State as associate head coach.\nOn May 1, 2003, Iowa State suspended Barnes for alleged threats against administrators in response to a suspension of Eustachy. Iowa State fired Eustachy, and Barnes was not retained for the following season.\nEustachy returned to coaching at Southern Miss in 2004 and hired Barnes as associate head coach. Barnes helped Southern Miss make the 2012 NCAA Tournament.\nIn 2012, Barnes followed Eustachy to Colorado State and started as director of player personnel for a year before moving up to full-time assistant coach in 2013.\nOn February 3, 2018, Colorado State promoted Barnes to interim head coach after placing regular head coach Larry Eustachy on leave pending an investigation into Eustachy's behavior. Colorado State went 0–2 with Barnes as head coach, with a 76-67 loss to Nevada on February 3 and 78–73 loss to Air Force on February 6. On February 10, Colorado State placed Barnes on leave as well."

The hosts continued to be placed in Pot 1 and treated as a seeded team, and therefore Pot 1 consisted of hosts Russia and the seven highest-ranked teams that qualified for the tournament.\nThe draw sequence started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4.\nAs with previous editions, no group had more than one team from any continental confederation except for UEFA, which had at least one, but no more than two in a group.\nSeeding.\nTeams were seeded using the October 2017 FIFA World Rankings (shown in parentheses), which were published on 16 October 2017."

South Africa would not be permitted to return to the Olympics until 1992.\nRhodesia was also prevented from entering the 1972 Summer Olympics when its invitation was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee following protests by other African countries.\nPossibly the most famous Olympic boycotts occurred in 1980 and 1984, due to the Soviet war in Afghanistan.\nIn 2021, several nations announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics to protest against Chinese mistreatment of the Uyghur population, thus prohibiting many government officials from attending the games in an official capacity, while still permitting athletes to compete.\nLater, India joined the boycott over China's decision to choose Qi Fabao, a regimental commander in the People's Liberation Army, as a torchbearer for the event.\nList of COVID-19 pandemic non-attendance of government officials or diplomatic boycotts of the Olympic Games.\nNote: During the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Russia, due to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the violation of the Olympic Truce, the United States and United Kingdom diplomatically boycotted the event, and the entire Ukrainian delegation except for their flagbearer boycotted the opening ceremony."

The Ministry of Culture and Sport withdrew Greek government recognition of the organisation in September 2014 due to the low number of active clubs participating in the sport. Control and development of rugby was passed to the Hellenic Handball Federation which announced it would begin a series of friendly matches between existing clubs until enough teams were established to reinstate an official competitive league.\nIn May 2023, the Greek General Secretariat of Sports restored recognition of the Greek Rugby Federation."

He has previously played in MLB for the Kansas City Royals, with whom he debuted in 2018.\nAmateur career.\nKeller attended Flowery Branch High School in Flowery Branch, Georgia, playing for their baseball team, the Falcons. He was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the eighth round of the 2013 MLB draft. He had committed to play college baseball at Presbyterian College, but chose to sign with the Diamondbacks rather than attend college.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nKeller made his professional debut that year with the Arizona League Diamondbacks and was later promoted to the Missoula Osprey. In 15 games (13 starts), he posted a 7–3 record and 2.44 ERA. In 2014, he pitched for the Arizona League Diamondbacks, Missoula and Hillsboro Hops, going 6–4 with a 4.31 ERA over 15 games (12 starts). Keller pitched for the Kane County Cougars in 2015, going 8–9 with a 2.60 ERA over 26 games (25 starts), the Visalia Rawhide in 2016 where he went 9–7 with a 4.47 ERA in 24 starts, and 2017 with the Jackson Generals, where he posted a 10–9 record and 4.68 ERA in 26 starts.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 14, 2017, Keller was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the Rule 5 draft and immediately traded to the Kansas City Royals for cash considerations.\nKeller made the 25-man roster for the Royals in 2018 and had his MLB debut on Opening Day, March 29, pitching an inning of scoreless relief against the Chicago White Sox; he struck out the first batter he faced, Adam Engel. He split time between the bullpen and the rotation, leading the team in ERA (3.08) and tied for first on the team in wins (9). He struck out 96 batters in innings. On April 19, 2019, Keller received a five-game suspension by Major League Baseball, which concluded he intentionally threw a pitch that hit Tim Anderson of the Chicago White Sox.\nOn July 7, 2020, it was announced that Keller had tested positive for COVID-19. Ten days later, he was cleared to return to the Royals’ Summer Camp after producing two negative tests at least 24 hours apart. On September 13, 2020, Keller pitched the first complete game shutout of his career against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing five hits (only one for extra bases) and one walk, striking out two batters. With the 2020 Kansas City Royals, Keller appeared in nine games, compiling a 5–3 record with 2.47 ERA and 35 strikeouts in innings pitched. In 2021, he started 26 games and posted an 8–12 record, a 5.39 ERA and 120 strikeouts in innings.\nOn August 18, 2022, Keller was moved to the bullpen after struggling to begin the year. On September 22, he tossed a scoreless ninth inning against the Minnesota Twins to earn his first career save. In 35 appearances (22 games), he pitched to a 6-14 record and 5.09 ERA with 102 strikeouts in innings of work.\nOn May 19, 2023, after nine starts, Keller was placed on the injured list with right shoulder impingement syndrome. On August 16, he was transferred to the 60–day injured list. Keller was activated from the injured list on September 9.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn March 8, 2024, Keller signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. After three starts for the Triple–A Charlotte Knights, the White Sox added Keller to their major league roster on April 28."

The 38th annual edition of the tournament began on March 22, and concluded with the championship game on April 7 at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, with the University of South Florida serving as host. The tournament field was announced on March 18.\nThree schools, Colonial champion Towson, MEAC champion Bethune–Cookman and Southland champion Abilene Christian, made their first appearance in the tournament. Meanwhile, Tennessee continued its record streak of making every NCAA women's basketball tournament at 38 consecutive appearances. UConn also continued its record streak of 12 consecutive Final Four appearances.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe selection committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\n2019 NCAA tournament schedule and venues.\nThe first two rounds, also referred to as the subregionals, were played at the sites of the top 16 seeds, as was done since 2015. However, the subregional that would otherwise have been hosted by South Carolina was moved to Charlotte, North Carolina due to the Gamecocks' home, Colonial Life Arena, being used for the men's tournament.\nSubregionals (first and second rounds)\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nThis is the third time that the women's Final Four was played in Tampa (previously, in 2008 and 2015).\nSubregionals tournament and automatic qualifiers.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams automatically qualified for the 2019 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament.\nBracket.\nAll times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time ()&lt;br&gt;\nFinal Four.\nDuring the Final Four round, regardless of the seeds of the participating teams, the champion of the top overall top seed's region (Baylor's Greensboro Region) plays against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region (Mississippi State's Portland Region), and the champion of the second overall top seed's region (Notre Dame's Chicago Region) plays against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region (Louisville's Albany Region).\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nThe tournament was covered by ESPN's networks. During the first and second rounds, ESPN aired select games nationally on ESPN2, ESPNU, and ESPNews. All other games aired regionally on ESPN, ESPN2, or ESPN3 and were streamed online via WatchESPN. Most of the nation got whip-a-round coverage during this time, which allowed ESPN to rotate between the games and focus the nation on the game that had the closest score. Over the course of rebroadcasting a studio program discussing the men's tournament, ESPNU accidentally displayed on-screen graphics prematurely revealing the tournament bracket prior to its formal unveiling that evening. The NCAA officially released the brackets two hours earlier than scheduled. Some watch parties for schools scheduled with the bracket reveal were cancelled, and ESPN apologized for the error.\nBroadcast assignments.\n\"First &amp; second rounds Friday/Sunday\"\n\"Sweet Sixteen &amp; Elite Eight Friday/Sunday\"\n\"Final Four\"\n\"First &amp; second rounds Saturday/Monday\"\n\"Sweet Sixteen &amp; Elite Eight Saturday/Monday\"\n\"Championship\"\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament.

In the game, players control mechas and must race to shoot a golf ball into the hole. \"100ft Robot Golf\" was released in October 2016 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR and in March 2017 for Windows. The game was met with a mixed reception.\nGameplay.\nPlayers choose from a number of mechas to play through golf courses with. Each mecha has different abilities and gameplay mechanics for hitting the ball. As opposed to traditional golf, all players play at the same time, with the goal of getting their ball into the hole first. Players can demolish buildings, block opposing shots with their mecha, and attack other competitors. In-game commentators (Justin, Griffin, and Travis McElroy) spectate the players' actions.\nDevelopment and release.\nIndie studio No Goblin previously developed \"Roundabout\" in 2014. During a Let's Play of \"Neo Turf Masters\", a member of No Goblin mentioned that a game having mechas play golf in space was never made before. \nAccording to the co-founder of No Goblin, Dan Teasdale, the studio took anime from the 1970s and 1980s and \"overdubbed it\". Teasdale helped to develop \"Rock Band\" and \"Destroy All Humans!\". No Goblin initially produced the in-game commentary themselves; however, they ultimately decided to commission the McElroy brothers because they needed people \"way funnier than [them]\". \nSony requested the studio to port \"100ft Robot Golf\" to the PlayStation VR (PS VR). During the PlayStation Experience 2015 opening keynote, \"100ft Robot Golf\" was announced for the PS VR and PlayStation 4 (PS4), stating that the game would be published by 2016. No Goblin released \"100ft Robot Golf\" for PS4 on October 10, 2016, and for PS VR on October 13. After the studio improved the graphics and writing, the game was released for Microsoft Windows on March 16, 2017. \nReception.\nThe game has received \"mixed or average\" reviews, holding an aggregated score of 56 on Metacritic. On OpenCritic, the game has a \"weak\" approval rating of 0%. "

        "text": "The 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile, or 2017 Giro Rosa, was the 28th running of the Giro d'Italia Femminile, the only remaining women's Grand Tour. It was held between 30 June and 9 July 2017 as the most prestigious stage race of both the 2017 UCI Women's World Tour and the women's calendar.\nThe race was won for the second time in three years by Olympic and European champion Anna van der Breggen () from the Netherlands, who took the leader's pink jersey after the second stage and maintained the lead for the remainder of the race, taking the overall lead of the UCI Women's World Tour standings in the process. Van der Breggen triumphed in the race overall by 63 seconds from the highest-placed Italian rider Elisa Longo Borghini, of the team.\nThe podium was completed by 's Annemiek van Vleuten, who was a further 36 seconds behind Longo Borghini; van Vleuten, also from the Netherlands, had the best all-around performance among the overall contenders, winning two stages and two jerseys – the points classification and also the mountains classification. Danish rider Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig () extended her lead in the youth classification of the overall Women's World Tour standings by winning the race's young rider classification, while van der Breggen's team were the winners of the team classification, after also placing defending race winner Megan Guarnier and Karol-Ann Canuel – the only other rider to wear the pink jersey, having done so after the opening stage team time trial – inside the top ten overall.\nTeams.\n24 teams participated in the 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile. The top 15 UCI Women's World Tour teams were automatically invited, and obliged to attend the race.\nRoute.\nThe route for the 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile was announced on 12 April 2017.\nClassification leadership table.\nIn the 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile, five different jerseys were awarded. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages with the exception of the time trials: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a cyclamen jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage, and unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages – with the exception of the team time trial, which awarded no points towards the classification – were awarded the same number of points. For winning a stage, a rider earned 15 points, with 12 for second, 10 for third, 8 for fourth, 6 for fifth with a point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th place.\nThere was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either second, or third-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs; however on both categories, the top five riders were awarded points. The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1995 were eligible to be ranked in the classification.\nThe fifth and final jersey represented the classification for Italian riders, marked by a blue jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Italy were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. The daily team leaders wore red dossards in the following stage."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cyclones represent Iowa State University in the NCAA's Big 12 Conference.\nIowa State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Iowa State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2015–16 season."

Roberts is regarded by the Britball community as one of the best defensive backs to play the game in Britain.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts joined the Bulls in 1985.\nIn 1988, Roberts picked off then-Leicester Falcons quarterback Sean Payton to secure a 19-14 win. In April of that year, Roberts, along with Joe St. Louis of the London Ravens were to be flown to Chicago for trials with the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Steelers. It was this year that Roberts set a record of 8 turnovers, 5 interceptions and 3 fumble recoveries, that would stand for 27 years.\nRoberts was instrumental in the Bulls' win over the Nottingham Hoods in the 1991 semi-final, intercepting the ball twice and returning one for the winning score. In 1994, Roberts intercepted the ball 8 times, then a record, since matched by Gareth Thomas.\nRoberts last played for the Bulls in 2006.\nFollowing his move to the Arrows in 2008, Roberts came out of retirement and found himself on the active roster.\nInternational career.\nRoberts made his debut for the GB Lions in 1986 against the Netherlands in a series of two victories in the European Nations Championship Qualifier.\nRoberts was part of the Lions squad that defeated France 26-0 at the Alexander Stadium to secure their place in the 1987 European Nations Championship.\nHe was also selected to be a part of the final victorious squad for the 1991 European Nations Championship in Finland, and was one of eight Lions selected to the All-Europe team.\nCoaching career.\nRoberts joined former team, the Redditch Arrows, as a defensive backs coach in 2008.\nRoberts returned to the Bulls in 2011 under head coach Steve Hannington as a defensive backs coach alongside former Bulls and Arrows teammate Mark Williams. When former Arrows coach Ian Hill took over the reins in 2012, Roberts stayed on as a defensive backs coach for the 2013 and 2014 seasons.\nWhen new head coach Mark Pagett installed his staff for 2015, Roberts remained as defensive backs coach.\nUnder his tutelage, Bulls defensive backs have represented the GB Lions national team and others have broken Bulls records for interceptions and takeaways set by Roberts himself during his playing days. Several defensive backs to have played under Roberts have received Team or Defensive MVP awards."

        "text": "James Robert Chisholm (born 11 August 1995) is an English professional rugby union player, currently playing for Harlequins in the Gallagher Premiership. His primary position is Number Eight, but he can also play at flanker.\nBackground.\nChisholm, youngest of the three Chisholm brothers (Ali, Ross who is also a professional rugby player), was born in Haywards Heath, Sussex, to Peter and Sue Chisholm. He took up the game with Haywards Heath RFC. Chisholm was educated in London Meed Primary School and Warden Park. He later attended sixth-form at Brighton College and captained the school's 1st XV.\nOutside of rugby, Chisholm is also the former Sussex Under 18 high jump champion.\nClub career.\nHarlequins.\n2013–2014\nChisholm joined the full-time Harlequins Academy in July 2013 and made his senior debut that same year against Exeter Chiefs in the LV= Cup. The back-row made his starting debut a week later, and played the full 80 minutes in the victory over Sale Sharks in the same competition.\n2014–2015\nWhile on-loan playing for the RFU Championship side London Scottish, Chisholm made a total of 10 appearances and scored 2 tries during the 2014–2015 season.\nOn 13 October 2014, it was a special occasion when Chisholm was joined by his 2 older brothers Ali and Ross to play for Harlequins A against Exeter Braves in the A-league.\n2015–2016\nThe 2015 Six Nations Champion and 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship Finalist signed a dual contract with London Scottish. He later made 2 appearances against Rotherham Titans and Moseley in the season.\n2016–2017\nAfter being involved in the victorious England Saxons tour in South Africa during the 2016 June international window and a strong pre-season with Harlequins, Chisholm started the 2016–2017 campaign brightly and produced a Man of the Match performance in the opening round of European Rugby Challenge Cup match against Stade Français. He crossed over the try line two times and out-gunned his opposite number Sergio Parisse during the pool match.\nIn November 2016, Chisholm re-signed for Harlequins.\nAt the end of the season, Chisholm was named IG's Players' Player of the Season, DHL's Player of the Season and the Nick Duncombe Young Player of the Season.\n2020–2021\nHe scored a try after coming on as a replacement during Harlequins 43-36 defeat of Bristol Bears in the Premiership semi-final, a game in which Quins recovered from 28 points down to win.

He also led the side to a 27–22 victory over hosts France at Grenoble in the subsequent FIRA/AER Final and scored three tries in the tournament.\nDuring the summer tour to South Africa, Chisholm touch downed two times in the opening match against South Africa and he captained the side in all three games that produced wins over Wales by 17–15 and France by 12–8.\nIn December 2013, the Harlequins Number Eight reclaimed the armband in his last U18 international match and led his England U18 side to a convincing 23–3 win over Australia Schoolboys at Harrow School.\nEngland U20\nChisholm's maiden try for England U20 was against Scotland at Galashiels in February 2014 and he shared in the side's IRB Junior World Championship triumph in New Zealand the following June, playing in all five matches. He scored two tries in the 63–3 pool win over Italy. James added another when England lost 21–15 to Wales at Colwyn Bay in the opening game of the 2015 Six Nations Under 20s Championship and made his fifth touchdown at this level against Scotland that March. He also scored tries against France and South Africa during the World Championship in Italy in June 2015.\nChisholm was the BMW Man of the Match in successive games against Scotland and France and said after England clinched the 2015 Six Nations title: “It was amazing but tough at times. We knew it would come and it doesn't get better than this. It was tremendous to do it here in Brighton.”\nSubsequently, he was named World Rugby Junior Player of the Year 2015.\nEngland Saxons\nIn Summer 2016, Chisholm was named in the England Saxons squad's tour to South Africa for the 2-match series against South African A team."

        "text": "Cricketers who debuted for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class cricket from the beginning of the 1827 season until the end of the 1863 season are as follows. Many of the players continued to represent the club after 1863 but they are only listed here, as it was in this period that they made their MCC debuts. Players who debuted for MCC before 1827 can be found in List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1787–1826).\nThe \"roundarm era\" began in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches being played that season; 1863 was the last season before overarm bowling was legalised.\nMCC played all its home matches through the roundarm era at its own Lord's venue in north London. Although many of the players who represented the club were members or ground staff, others were associated with county clubs or teams and appeared for MCC by invitation. MCC teams have always operated at all levels of the sport and players who represented the club in minor cricket only are out of scope here.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the span of years in which he was active as an MCC player in important matches (the span may include years in which he played in minor matches only for MCC and/or years in which he did not represent MCC in any matches) and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards (e.g., surname preceded by all initials). In cases where the player represented significant other teams besides MCC, these are given at the end of his entry."

Jersey and the Netherlands were interested in hosting the tournament, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded it to South Africa, due to the ease of securing visas for the teams involved.\nThe teams were placed into two groups of four sides. Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Italy and Qatar are in Group A, and Germany, Ghana, Jersey and Vanuatu are in Group B. The top two teams in each group progressed to the semi-finals, while the other two teams competed for placings. The top two teams qualified for the World Cricket League Division Four tournament, scheduled to take place in the middle of 2018, and five teams were relegated to regional divisions.\nBoth Jersey and Vanuatu won their semi-final matches, therefore progressing to the tournament final, with both teams being promoted to Division Four. In the final, Jersey beat Vanuatu by 120 runs to win the tournament. Qatar won the third-place playoff by 3 wickets to remain in Division Five, with all the other teams being relegated.\nTeams.\nEight teams qualified for the tournament.

A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate, often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down. Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch, and the ball may be nearby, but the catcher has trouble finding the ball, allowing runners to advance.\nTony Mullane is the all-time leader in wild pitches with 343 career. Mullane is also the only player to throw more than 300 career wild pitches."

It is also where Furman alums and professional golfers Betsy King, Beth Daniel, Dottie Pepper and Brad Faxon honed their college games.\nThe par-72 layout underwent a major renovation in 2008, where all 18 greens were reconstructed under USGA specifications and reseeded with Champion UltraDwarf Bermudagrass. A long-term master plan, implemented in 2010, has led to a new practice facility for the Furman golf teams, enhanced public practice facilities, new tees to accommodate golfers of all levels, bunker strategy improvement, refurbished cart paths, irrigation upgrades, major drainage installation and clubhouse enhancements. The course now also qualifies as a PGA Family Course."

        "text": "The Simon Fraser Red Leafs men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. The Red Leafs play at the Bill Copeland Arena and are coached by Mark Coletta. The Red Leafs ice hockey team competes in the BCIHL, as well as playing NCAA competition every year. After announcing their intent to explore full-time NCAA Division 1 status in 2016, the SFU Men's hockey program would play NCAA Div.1 games under probationary status for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons.\nThe Red Leafs have won Four BCIHL titles. They regularly host and travel to play NCAA Division I programs, as well as an ongoing cross town rivalry with the UBC Thunderbirds of U Sports. SFU was a founding member of the BCIHL in 2006. In the summer of 2016 the university announced its intent to move the program entirely to the NCAA Division I level.\nHistory.\nThe current incarnation of SFU hockey began in 2006 with the formation of the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League. SFU did field a team in the '70s however not much is known or documented about the team. SFU made their first league final and won their first BCIHL title in 2008, following it up with another finals appearance in 2009 eventually losing to the University of Victoria. In 2010 and 2011 the Clan would win back-to-back BCIHL championships, 2011 being their most recent title. From 2008 to 2014 SFU would make the league final seven straight seasons. SFU would once again finish first in the 2016–17 BCIHL regular season.\nNCAA.\nSince 2012-13 Simon Fraser University has been playing NCAA Division 1 programs with increased frequency. 2012–13 saw the Clan face off against the Air Force Falcons of Atlantic Hockey. It would also see them play host to the Arizona State Sun Devils and Oklahoma Sooners. 2013-14 saw the Clan travel to college hockey hotbed Boston and take on the Sacred Heart Pioneers and College of the Holy Cross Crusaders. That year they would also host two major historical college hockey programs in the 8 time NCAA Champion University of North Dakota Fighting Hawks, and two time ECAC champion Princeton Tigers. 2014-15 would take the Clan to Ohio to take on the perennial powerhouse Miami RedHawks who would go on to capture the NCHC championship that year, as well as the former national champion Bowling Green Falcons. 2015-16 would once again take the Clan back to Boston to play the defending national champion Providence College Friars, as well as former national champions in the Northeastern University Huskies. 2016-17 would be the first season played by the Clan under probationary NCAA Division 1 status. The season saw the Clan travel to Alaska to take on the Alaska Anchorage Seawolves and the Alaska Fairbanks Nanooks, then in February they would travel to Tempe, Arizona to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils for the second time in their history.\nUniversity Hockey Classic.\nEach September, SFU Hockey meets UBC in the annual University Hockey Classic pre-season matchup. The event takes aim at building on the historic cross-town rivalry between the two schools, a rivalry that extends from hockey into other sports such as football and even academic programs. The University Hockey Classic began in 2011 with over 1600 passionate fans on hand to witness SFU defeat UBC in a two-game series and has continued yearly ever since.\nGreat Northwest Showcase.\nThe Great Northwest Showcase is a bi-annual men's ice hockey tournament hosted by Simon Fraser University. The Great Northwest Showcase is meant to showcase collegiate hockey in the Vancouver area, and create a platform to showcase SFU and UBC players to a variety of professional scouts."

        "title": "Matthew Shepherd (rugby)",
        "text": "Matthew Shepherd (born 1990) is an English and Cornish rugby union player who currently plays at scrum-half or full back for Redruth in National League 2 South, having previously played for Plymouth Albion in National League 1. An extremely reliable points scorer with a knack for scoring important tries, he was instrumental in Cornwall's County Championship victories in 2015 and 2016 and has also been capped by England Counties XV. As well as playing union, Shepherd has played summer rugby league for the Cornish Rebels.\nCareer.\nFirst spell with St Austell.\nAfter spending the beginning of his rugby career with St Austell from the age of 6 through to U16 he joined Perranporth. After one season at Perranporth playing for their Colts side he returned to St Austell to start his adult career. He came into prominence for St Austell during the 2009–10 season, when playing at scrum-half he showed good try scoring instinct as he helped his team to a third-place finish in Tribute Cornwall/Devon. The next season his team went one better after clinching the second promotion spot by finishing as runners up behind runaway league champions, Bideford. Shepherd played an important part in his club's promotion, taking over kicking duties from Andy Ashwin, and finishing with 228 league points – a figure that also included 10 tries. The form of the young Shepherd saw him come to the attention of fellow Cornish club, Redruth, who had just been relegated from National League 1.\nRedruth and Pirates.\nShepherd signed for Redruth for the start of the 2011–12 National League 2 South season but returned to St Austell after just a month away and a handful of games played, citing difficulties due to work commitments and the increased travel required for away games in the division. While at Redruth he was dual-registered with the Cornish Pirates for their 2011–12 British and Irish Cup squad. He made a solitary appearance for the Cornish Pirates on 2 October 2011, making a late second half appearance from the substitute bench as his team won 38–0 away against Plymouth Albion in a pool game.\nReturn to St Austell.\nBack with St Austell, now in Tribute Western Counties West, Shepherd played in all of the club's remaining league appearances of the season, scoring 159 points as the newly promoted side finished in a very respectable 4th place. St Austell had actually led the league at one point, but lost their way slightly at the end of the season, meaning that they missed out on second place (and a promotion playoff) by just four points. St Austell also reached the final of the 2012 Cornwall Cup held at the Memorial Ground, Penryn, facing Wadebridge Camels who were one division higher. Shepherd featured in the match but despite contributing 7 points from the boot was unable to stop Wadebridge Camels winning the cup in close game, 20–17. The 2011–12 season would end on a high for Shepherd, however, as he was called up by Cornwall for their annual Tamar Cup game against Devon. He made his county début on 24 April 2012, coming on as a second-half substitute, in Cornwall's 36–15 victory at the game held at Polson Bridge, Launceston.\nThe 2012–13 season would be both Shepherd's and St Austell's most successful to date. He played all 26 league games in Tribute Western Counties as his club stored to the league title ahead of Bideford, contributing an outstanding 288 points to the title campaign, including 22 tries. Despite an early exit from the Cornwall Cup, St Austell embarked on a great run in the RFU Intermediate National Cup. After a walkover win in the first round they defeated Berry Hill, and then Wimborne to win the RFU South West Intermediate Cup and book a place in the National Cup semi-finals – one game from the final to be held at Twickenham. Unfortunately it would not be season hat trick for Shepherd and St Austell as they lost the semi-final game 19–31, away to south-east winners, Brighton Blues. In April Shepherd was once more called up by Cornwall to take part in the Tamar Cup game against Devon, starting the game and kicking 7 points in a 17–0 victory away at the Brickfields in Plymouth. He would also be included in Cornwall's county championship squad, making appearances from the substitutes bench as his county reached the final of the 2013 Bill Beaumont Cup, losing 26–36 to Lancashire at Twickenham, with Shepherd coming on during the second half.\nThe 2013–14 season would be Shepherd's last at St Austell. Despite being newly promoted to Tribute South West 1 West his club held its own and finished in 4th spot behind fellow Cornish side, Camborne, with Shepherd enjoying another prolific year with 263 points (including 19 tries) from the 25 games he played in. St Austell also reached the final of the Cornwall Cup for the second year running, again ending up empty handed as they lost 10–24 to league rivals Camborne at the Recreation Ground in Redruth with Shepherd kicking 5 points for the losing side. Over the summer of 2014 Shepherd was called up to the Cornwall squad for the 2014 Bill Beaumont Cup having featured in the 17–0 Tamar Cup warm-up victory against Devon at Polson Bridge, Launceston. At the county championships proper Cornwall once again finished as runners up to nemesis Lancashire, losing 26–36 in the Twickenham final, with Shepherd making an appearance from the substitutes bench early in the second half.\nLaunceston.\nFor the 2014–15 season Shepherd left St Austell to sign for Launceston to have another stab at National League 2 South following his early spell with Redruth (who had also chased his signature over the summer). Coach Neil Bayliss had been looking at Shepherd for some time following his displays for St Austell and Cornwall, and felt that he would help provide strength in depth as well as being a backup kicker to club stalwart, Kieron Lewitt. He made his début away Bishop's Stortford on 6 September 2014, scoring a try in an 18–19 defeat. His versatility across the back line meant that he featured in all of Launceston's league matches that season, contributing 70 points including 8 tries, as his club finished 10th in the league, level on points with rivals Redruth who finished in 9th place due to having one more win.\nShepherd really clicked in gear with Launceston during the second half of the season and he continued his form with Cornwall, first by scoring 14 points including a try in a dominant 38–13 victory against Devon in the Tamar Cup match at Brickfields, Plymouth. He then went to play a starring role at the 2015 Bill Beaumont Cup as Cornwall went on to win their first championship in 16 years, scoring 2 tries and a conversion in the 18–13 final victory over Lancashire at Twickenham. In winning the cup, Shepherd would also finish as the competition's top scorer with a tally of 64 points, including 4 tries. His spectacular displays with Cornwall saw Shepherd called up by the England Counties XV side for their tour of Romania during the summer and he marked his international début with a try and 13 points overall in a 28–0 win over Romania A.\nPlymouth Albion.\nDuring the summer of 2015 Shepherd signed for Plymouth Albion, playing a division higher in National League 1, and coached by Shepherd's Cornwall coach Graham Dawe. He was just one of the many players over the close season that were signed by Plymouth Albion from nearby Launceston – a consequence of Albion's recent relegation from the RFU Championship, and the coaches familiarity with Launceston's many county championship squad players. Shepherd made his Plymouth Albion league début on 5 September 2015, appearing from the bench in a 33–20 home win over Richmond. He would go on to appear in all 30 of Albions league matches that season (7 from the substitutes bench), contributing 189 points including 14 tries, making him the 5th highest scorer in the league overall. Albion were one of the top sides in National League 1 and were actually challenging for the league title until the latter stages of the season when the club went into administration and were docked 30 points, meaning that they ended up in 8th place despite having the second most wins in the league behind champions, Richmond.\nAt the season's end Shepherd was called up by Cornwall for the 2016 Bill Beaumont Cup, appearing in the warm-up Tamar Cup victory over Devon, 45–10 at Tregorrick Park, St Austell. At the county championships Shepherd once again played a key role as Cornwall went on to retain the cup with a 35–13 win over Cheshire in the Twickenham final. He finished as the competition's second top scorer with 48 points – 20 of which came in the final. During the summer of 2016 Shepherd was once more invited by England Counties XV to take part in their tour of Canada. On a successful tour in which Counties won all their matches, Shepherd played his part by kicking 16 points in the two games he appeared in.\nThe 2016–17 season saw Shepherd feature in all 30 of Albion's league games, contributing 164 points, including 10 tries, as his team finished second in National League 1 – some distance behind record breaking champions Hartpury College. He would be called up by Cornwall for the 2017 Bill Beaumont Cup, helping his county to reach the final once again but ultimately being unable to claim a third title in a row as they were well beaten 8–19 by Lancashire at Twickenham. After the county championships, Shepherd was called up by England Counties XV to take part in their tour of Spain. He made his first appearance on the tour from the substitutes bench, kicking 4 points as Counties beat Euskarians 61–19 in San Sebastián. He then started the second game of the tour, contributing ten points from the boot as Counties beat Spain 45–28 in Guadalajara.\nAfter finishing in mid-table with Albion at the end of the 2018–19 season, Shepherd returned to county action with Cornwall, helping them to retain the Tamar Cup at the Brickfields against Devon, contributing three conversions in a 28–13 victory. Although he missed the first game of the 2019 Bill Beaumont Cup, Shepherd played in the two remaining group games and was selected to start the Twickenham final against Cheshire. In a tense game, he helped orchestrate Cornwall from scrum-half after the original scrum-half was red-carded, and it was Shepherd who held his nerve to kick the match-winning conversion (well into injury time), to win the game 14–12. It was Shepherd's third county championship title, and Cornwall's sixth overall.\nRedruth.\nIn the summer of 2019, Shepherd rejoined Redruth after having spent four seasons at Plymouth Albion, dropping down a division to play in National League 2 South. He would take up a position as a player-coach at the Reds, who he had previously had a short spell with back in 2011.\nRugby League.\nWhile rugby union is his main game, Shepherd has also played rugby league for the Cornish Rebels during the summer months on a number of occasions. He made his first appearance for the Rebels on 11 August 2013, scoring 2 tries and a conversion as his side won 60–10 against the Plymouth Titans at the Recreation Ground in Redruth to book a place in the South West Rugby League Grand Final. A couple of weeks later Shepherd was part of the Rebels side that took part in the Grand Final held at Polson Bridge in Launceston against the Devon Sharks. Although strong favourites having dominated the league stage and having beaten the Sharks three times already, the Rebels had their poorest performance of the season and ended up the wrong side of a 24–38 scoreline, Shepherd getting 2 tries for the losing side. Shepherd also represented Cornwall in their County of Origin win over Devon in August 2013, scoring two tries and kicking 6 conversions to help his side to a 36–26 victory at the Recreation Ground in Redruth.\nIn 2014 despite having just won the rugby union county championships with Cornwall, Shepherd decided to once more play summer rugby league with the Cornish Rebels, making his first appearance and scoring 2 tries in a 58–24 win over the Plymouth Titans in the semi-finals of the South-West Challenge Cup. A week later he made his first league appearance of the campaign, helping himself to 4 tries as the Rebels won 50–20 away to the Exeter Centurions. At the end of June the Rebels won their first silverware of the season when they defeated Exeter Centurions 38–26 at Polson Bridge in Launceston to retain the South-West Challenge Cup, with Shepherd grabbing a try. In August the Rebels then claimed the league title to make it a double, winning the South Grand Final at Tregorrick Park, St Austell, after a 68–16 win over the Plymouth Titans, Shepherd getting yet another try to make it an impressive personal total of 14 for the summer.\nHonours and records.\nRugby Union.\nSt Austell\nCornwall\nEngland Counties XV\nIndividual\nRugby League.\nCornish Rebels\nCornwall"

Kent also hosted a List A match against the touring Sri Lanka A team and a three-day match without first-class status against Cardiff UCCE, both at the St Lawrence Ground.\nThe team narrowly avoided relegation from Division One of the County Championship, with a number of matches affected by rain including one match in Worcester that was abandoned without a ball being bowled. In List A cricket, Kent finished mid-table in both the South Conference of the Friends Provident Trophy and Division Two of the Natwest Pro40 (although they only missed out on promotion in the latter tournament by a single point).\nThe highlight of the season was victory at finals day of the Twenty20 Cup at Edgbaston on 4 August. Kent defeated Sussex in their semi-final by 5 wickets, and then later in the day beat Gloucestershire by 4 wickets – aided by a hat-trick by Ryan McLaren – to win the title for the first time.\nSquad.\nRob Key was re-appointed as club captain ahead of the 2007 season. Key lead a new-look squad, including overseas signing Yasir Arafat (the Pakistan all-rounder joined after having played for Sussex in 2006). Yasir would be Kent's second overseas player for 2007, joining South African all-rounder Andrew Hall. Following the 2006 season, Kent had released former captain David Fulton, wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien and bowlers Simon Cusden, Matthew Dennington and David Stiff.\nDue to international commitments, Hall was away from the county during the group stage of the Twenty20 Cup in the second half of June and early July. Kent signed another South African, fast bowler Morné Morkel, to play in these eight T20 matches. After returning for two County Championship matches, Hall then left the county again in late-July and this time was replaced by Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga on a short-term contract until the end of the season.\nLeft-arm spinner Min Patel retained the vice-captaincy, but injury restricted him to just a single championship appearance plus the tour match against Sri Lanka A (in which he captained a mostly young side) and he retired at the end of the season. Patel made his debut for Kent in 1989, earned two Test caps for England in 1996, and took a total of 630 first class wickets as well as 88 in List A and 15 in Twenty20 cricket (he played very little limited overs cricket in the latter years of his career). Patel had been at Kent throughout his career, also playing a short spell for Central Districts in New Zealand ahead of the 2006 English summer.\nUCCE match.\nKent's 3-day match against Cardiff UCCE in April did not have first-class status."

Their head coach was Matt Doherty. The team captains for this season were Jason Capel and Kris Lang. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nRoster.\nFingleton only played one game, against Davidson, before announcing he would transfer at the end of 2001. He later transferred to Holy Cross.\nSchedule and results.\nThe Tar Heels started their regular season with three losses, the first time they had done so in 73 years. Their first regular season and conference win over Georgia Tech avoided the program's first 0-4 start in its history.\nThe Tar Heels were ranked number 19 in that season's preseason AP Poll. They fell out of the AP Poll after losing to Hampton. It would be the Tar Heels' only AP Poll ranking that season.\nThe 2001-02 season was also the first season the Tar Heels did not make it to the championship game of the Tournament of Champions presented by Hardee's in ten years, falling to Charleston in the second game. The Tar Heels did manage to upset Saint Joseph's, then ranked number 15 in the AP Poll, in the consolation game.\nPrior to 2002, the largest margin of defeat against the Tar Heels in the Dean Smith Center was set in a 20-point loss against Duke in 1999. Kentucky, with 17 points, and NC State, with 18 points, nearly broke Duke's record, before Wake Forest succeeded with 22 points; Duke then reclaimed the record with a 29-point victory.\nAt the time, the away game at Cole Field House was the worst defeat in 79 years against Maryland, and the most points an opponent scored over the Tar Heels. The defeat also nearly matched the Tar Heels' worst defeat in their history with the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe home loss against NC State was also the worst home defeat to the Wolfpack since Dean Smith's first year as coach in 1962.\nThe Tar Heels matched their record for most losses in a season (15 losses in the 1950–51 and 1951-52 seasons) after their loss to Maryland at home. They would end the season with 20 losses, the most losses in the history of the program.\nThe Tar Heels ended their regular season at home with a 6-9 record, the worst home record in the history of the program.\nIn the 2002 ACC men's basketball tournament, the seventh-seeded Tar Heels were defeated by second-seeded Duke, who would go on to win that year's tournament.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| ACC Tournament"

At the time, it was assumed that the players were objecting to the fact that freshman Jeff Tropf, who was white, was starting over more experienced black players. Later, more complaints came to light including the arena being too cold during practice due to construction and the school's lack of emphasis on basketball. When the players returned an hour before game time, head coach Gus Ganakas suspended the players.\nAs a result, the team fielded junior varsity players and Tropf for the game against Indiana and were blown out 107–55. The next day, the suspended players aired their grievances with Ganakas, apologized, and were reinstated to the team.

Those participating were the 30 clubs that played in the 2016–17 Championship, League One and League Two of the Scottish Professional Football League along with the top four teams from the 2015–16 Highland and Lowland Leagues (East Stirlingshire, who were relegated from the SPFL, took the place of the Lowland League champions Edinburgh City, who promoted in their place). The top two teams from the 2015–16 Welsh Premier League and 2015–16 NIFL Premiership and the U20s squads of the teams competing in the 2016–17 Premiership were also invited to compete. For the first three rounds, the draw was divided into two geographical regions – north and south. These draws were seeded to avoid U20s teams and Highland and Lowland League sides from being drawn against each other. From round four onwards, the draw was regionalised to keep Welsh and Northern Irish teams apart.\nAs both clubs play in the Championship, they received a bye to the third round."

A week before the actual playoff stage, 4 out of 6 players in China's Overwatch World Cup team were denied from the tournament due to visa issues, receiving widespread criticism.\nQuarterfinals and semifinals were both supposed to be played on Nov 3, but due to the quarterfinals games running later than expected, the semifinals games were moved to Nov 4, right before the final match.\nAwards.\nMost Valuable Player (MVP): xQc"

Those founding members were:\nChampions.\n1930–31\nThe 1930–31 season was the first year the competition took place. The finalists were South Kirkby Common Road and Hemsworth Victoria Rovers, with the Hemsworth side prevailing. In a remarkable season Hemsworth Victoria Rovers also won the South Kirkby Football League and were beaten semi-finalists in the Pontefract Infirmary Cup and beaten finalists in the Doncaster Infirmary Shield.\n1931–32\nIn the 1931–32 season a record 19 teams entered the first round draw. The final was held at Westfield Lane, home of Frickley Colliery, with South Kirkby Common Road beating Moorthorpe Rangers.\n1932–33\nThe 1932–33 season saw Moorthorpe Rangers reach their second successive final, which again they lost, this time to Hemsworth Albion at Westfield Lane. At the end of the season Moorthorpe Rangers folded despite being one of the most successful junior football clubs in the district. Over 800 spectators crammed into the South Kirkby Miner's Welfare Ground to watch Hemsworth Albion win their semi-final replay.\n1933–34\nIn the 1933–34 season Askern Welfare beat South Kirkby Wednesday in the final.\n1934–45\nThe 1934–35 season final saw a losing return to the final for Askern Welfare, with Ackworth claiming the cup, presented to them by Councillor A. Flavell.\n1935–36\nIn the 1935–36 season Askern Welfare defeated Fitzwilliam Foresters, claiming the trophy for the second time.\n1936–37\nThe 1936–37 season saw South Kirkby Common Road beat South Kirkby Rovers in the final, held at Frickley Colliery's Westfield Lane. The win gave Common Road their second Elmsall Cup trophy, equalling the record of Askern Welfare.\n1937–38\nIn the 1937–38 season Ridgill beat South Kikby Common Road in a replayed final.\n1938–39\nThe 1938–39 season was a victorious one for Minsthorpe W.M.C. who hammered Upton Brookside six nil in the final in front of a record attendance. Two brothers were instrumental in the win, with Joe Sausse grabbing a hat-trick and Jim Sausse bagging two. In a curious twist Minsthorpe finished as runners up to Upton Brookside in the South Kirkby Football League this season.\n1939–40\nThe last known record of the 1939–40 season was the semi-final draw which saw holders Minsthorpe W.M.C. v Upton Brookside or Gibson's Sports and South Kirkby Juniors v Park Estate Rangers. It is not known who won the cup or if the competition was abandoned due to the outbreak of war as no records beyond December 1939 appear to exist."

        "text": "Kenneth Shawn Bell (born November 16, 1964) is a former American football return specialist for the Denver Broncos in the late 1980s.\nEarly years.\nBell attended the local high school in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he was part of a dominating football program and teammates with future Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. He was inducted into the high school's hall of fame in 2015.\nCollege.\nBell attended Boston College, appearing in all but one of the team's 48 games in four years from 1982 to 1985. His first three seasons, he was teammates with Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie. He had just 39 yards rushing and 112 returning kickoffs his freshman year, but his sophomore season saw increasing touches as a receiving running back (312 yards from scrimmage) and a returner (333). The season was highlighted by a 51-yard kickoff return to set up a late game-winning field goal in an 18-15 win over Temple. His junior year, Bell had 348 rushing yards, 200 receiving yards, and 410 kick return yards. He scored a 71-yard touchdown run on Nov 3 during a nationally televised game against Penn State. His senior year, 1985, he rarely returned kicks, but led the Eagles with 583 rushing yards for four touchdowns, along with 27 receptions for 237 yards.\nProfessional career.\nBell was undrafted out of college, but signed with the Denver Broncos for the 1986 season. Almost exclusively a kick returner (he had just 3 receptions and less than 100 yards rushing in four seasons with the team), Bell initially saw split duty with Gene Lang. However, after he finished his rookie year 6th in the league with 23.1 yards per return, he became the starter for all but three games where he was injured in 1987. Bell was so popular with the coaching staff, that even though his replacement Shane Swanson still holds the franchise rookie record for most all-purpose yards in a game, he was released from the team when Bell returned. In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, Bell muffed a kick-off return late in the 4th quarter of the AFC Championship Game, recovering it at the 2-yard line. This set up \"The Drive\", arguably the defining moment of Hall of Famer John Elway's career. Bell returned most of the Broncos kicks in both 1988 (career highs of 36 returns for 768 yards) and 1989 (30 returns for 602 yards). \n's NFL off-season, Bell still holds the Broncos franchise record for most playoff kick returns at 21."

Three holes-in-one were recorded, including one by the grandson of Jack Nicklaus.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 5, 2018\"\nJordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, birdied five consecutive holes on the back-nine to post a round of 66 (−6) and take the first round lead for the third time in four years. Playing a day after dislocating an ankle during the Par 3 Contest, Tony Finau finished two shots back, along with Matt Kuchar. Four-time champion Tiger Woods, playing the Masters for the first time in three years, was three-over after a bogey on the 12th but rebounded with two birdies to finish with 73 (+1). Defending champion Sergio García hit five consecutive balls onto the green which rolled back into the water on the par-5 15th and carded a one-putt 13, the highest score on that hole in Masters history, and tied for the worst in history on any hole. He birdied the next hole; his 81 (+9) put him in a tie for 85th place. \nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 6, 2018\"\nPlaying in the afternoon, Patrick Reed made nine birdies to go along with three bogies on his way to a 66 (−6). He had three separate streaks of three birdies to take a two shot lead over Marc Leishman. Leishman, playing with Tiger Woods, eagled the par-5 15th to shoot a 67 (−5). Henrik Stenson was four back of Reed after a solid 70 (−2). First-round leader Jordan Spieth fell back with a 74 (+2) to end the day at −4 overall along with Rory McIlroy. Woods, looking for his first win since 2013, made the cut with a 75 (+3). Doug Ghim was the only amateur that made the cut.\nAmateurs: \"Ghim\" (+4), Niemann (+9), Redman (+9), Lin (+15), Parziale (+16), Ellis (+22)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 7, 2018\"\nPatrick Reed recorded four birdies and two eagles on his way to a round of 67 and a three-shot lead heading to the final round. Reed was even on his round before three straight birdies on holes 8–10. At the par-5 13th, he hit his approach to 14 feet and made the putt for an eagle. Then on the 15th he chipped in from just off the green for another eagle. Rory McIlroy began the round five shots out of the lead but erased the deficit with a score of 31 on the first nine. He made three birdies in a four-hole stretch then chipped in for eagle at the par-5 8th to get into a share of the lead. Falling as much as five shots behind Reed on the second nine, McIlroy rebounded with birdies on the 15th and 18th to post a bogey-free round of 65 and cut Reed's advantage down to three. Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm both shot bogey-free rounds of 65 (−7) and were five and six shots behind, respectively. It was the first time in Masters history three players shot as low as 65 in the same round. The scoring average was 71.26, the lowest third round average since 1986. Marc Leishman began the day in the final pairing and two shots out of the lead but failed to make a birdie in a one-over round of 73.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 8, 2018\"\nSummary.\nPatrick Reed's one-under round of 71 was enough to hold off charges from Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth for his first major championship. Reed began the day three shots ahead of Rory McIlroy but bogeyed the 1st and failed to make birdie on the par-5 2nd. McIlroy had a eagle putt on the same hole that would have tied Reed but missed, settling for birdie to cut the deficit to one. Reed regained his advantage with a birdie on the 3rd hole while McIlroy made bogey. McIlroy made two more bogeys on the first nine, while Reed recovered from a bogey at 7 with a birdie on the 8th to take a four-shot lead to the second nine.\nJordan Spieth began the round nine shots behind Reed but mounted a charge to get back into contention. He birdied his first two holes and added three more birdies on the first nine. At the par-3 12th, where in 2016 he made a quadruple-bogey that cost him the title, he made a putt for birdie from just off the green. He made another birdie on the 13th after narrowly missing an eagle putt, two-putted for birdie on the par-5 15th, then made a 33-footer for birdie on the 16th to get to nine-under for the round and tie Reed. On the 18th, however, Spieth's drive hit a tree and he was unable to save par, settling for a round of 64 (−8).\nAt the same time, Rickie Fowler was making a challenge to Reed's lead. He began five shots behind and was one-over on his round thru seven, but made six birdies on his last 11 holes. At the 18th, he holed a 7-footer for birdie to post a round of 67 (−5) and get within one.\nReed, meanwhile, made bogey on the 11th but made a putt for birdie at the 12th. On the 13th, his approach to the par-5 came up short but hung up in the rough instead of falling into the water, but he was unable to get up-and-down for birdie. At the 14th, he hit his approach to eight feet and made the birdie putt, and was able to save par from over the green on 15. Reed faced an putt on the 17th which hit the cup and rolled five feet away, then saved par. With a one-shot lead heading to the last, Reed faced a downhill putt which he hit to four feet. Reed converted to win by one shot over Fowler and two over Spieth. Jon Rahm got to within two of the lead before hitting his approach at 15 into the water and making bogey, finishing alone in fourth place. McIlroy settled for a two-over round of 74 and tied for fifth, six shots behind Reed. Final round scoring average was 70.49, believed to be the lowest single round scoring average in the history of the Masters.\nFinal leaderboard.\nSources:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2017–18 La Liga",
        "text": "The 2017–18 La Liga season, also known as LaLiga Santander for sponsorship reasons, was the 87th since its establishment. The season began on 18 August 2017 and concluded on 20 May 2018. The fixtures were released on 21 July 2017.\nReal Madrid were the defending champions. Barcelona, under new manager Ernesto Valverde, won the league title on 29 April 2018 with four matches to spare. It was the second part of a double-winning season for Barcelona, who also won the 2018 Copa del Rey Final. \nLevante, Girona, and Getafe were the newly promoted clubs competing in the season, with Girona entering La Liga for the first time in its history. At the end of the season, Málaga, Las Palmas, and Deportivo La Coruña were all relegated to the Segunda División.\nSummary.\nPrior to the season, several teams hired new managers, among them the previous season's runners-up Barcelona, who enlisted the services of Ernesto Valverde from Athletic Bilbao after the exit of Luis Enrique. Meanwhile, Valencia, who had struggled in the previous campaign hired Marcelino.\nIn the transfer window, Barcelona were involved in the new world record transfer, selling Brazilian forward Neymar to French club Paris Saint-Germain for €222 million. They replaced him with young Frenchman Ousmane Dembélé, who signed for an initial €105 million fee that could rise to €150 million. Defending champions Real Madrid sold striker Álvaro Morata to Chelsea for €80 million and lost veteran defender Pepe to Turkey's Beşiktaş on a free transfer, while its largest fee paid during the window was €24 million for young defender Théo Hernandez from city rivals Atlético Madrid.\nBarcelona first topped the table on 16 September after winning 5–0 in its third match of the season against neighbours Espanyol, eventually making a run of seven wins from the start of the season that ended with a 1–1 draw at Atlético Madrid. Valencia improved on its previous campaign and began its new season well, with Marcelino getting the best out of players such as Italian striker Simone Zaza and on-loan Portuguese winger Gonçalo Guedes. Real Madrid struggled in the first half of the season, with problems including a smaller squad, injuries and the comparatively poorer goalscoring form of Cristiano Ronaldo relative to recent seasons.\nIn January 2018, Barcelona added to its attack by spending €160 million on Brazilian Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool, while the end of a transfer ban allowed Atlético to register Diego Costa and Vitolo for action. Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane made no signings. Málaga were the first team to be relegated, ending its ten-season stay in La Liga with its descent confirmed after a 0–1 loss against Levante on 19 April. Three days later, Las Palmas' relegation was also confirmed after the Canarian team lost 0–4 at home to Alavés to end its three-year top flight status.\nOn 29 April, Barcelona sealed its 25th league title with a 4–2 win at Deportivo La Coruña, with Lionel Messi scoring a hat-trick. Barcelona still had four matches to play, and it was the second part of its double, having earlier won the 2018 Copa del Rey Final. The result also made Deportivo the final of the three relegated teams, sending them back to Segunda División for the first time in four years.\nA day later, Real Betis, under new manager Quique Setién, booked its entry to the UEFA Europa League following a 2–1 win over Málaga. Betis had a chance of occupying Spain's fourth UEFA Champions League spot after Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, but that was soon taken by Valencia, which returned to the competition for the first time in three years. In its second-last match of the season, Sevilla drew 2–2 with city rivals Betis to confirm seventh place and qualification for the UEFA Europa League at the expense of Getafe. Barcelona were on track to complete the first unbeaten La Liga season since the Spanish Civil War (and first in a 38-match season), but surprisingly lost its 37th match 4–5 at Levante, having only conceded 24 goals all season to that point.\nTeams.\nPromotion and relegation (pre-season).\nA total of 20 teams competed in the league: the 17 sides from the 2016–17 season and the three promoted from the 2016–17 Segunda División. This latter three included the two top teams from the Segunda División and the winners of the play-offs.\nLevante was the first team from Segunda División to achieve promotion, after a one-year absence from La Liga, on 29 April 2017 after winning 1–0 against Oviedo. Girona were promoted as the runners-up after drawing 0–0 against Zaragoza on 4 June 2017, this was its first promotion to the top division. It became the 62nd team to participate in the Spanish top level league. Getafe was the last to be promoted after defeating Huesca and Tenerife in the play-offs, one year after its relegation.\nThe three promoted clubs replaced Sporting Gijón, Osasuna and Granada, which were relegated at the end of the previous season.\nStadia and locations.\nAtlético Madrid played for the first season at their new stadium, Wanda Metropolitano, replacing the Vicente Calderón Stadium, where they played since its opening in 1966.\nDeportivo La Coruña signed a sponsorship contract with Abanca for renaming their stadium as Abanca-Riazor.\nReal Betis completed their stadium renovation and it was grown to 60,720 seats, becoming the fourth biggest stadium in Spain. Meanwhile, after their first promotion ever to La Liga, Girona expanded Estadi Montilivi temporarily for hosting 13,450 spectators.\nLeague table.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSeason statistics.\nZamora Trophy.\nThe Zamora Trophy was awarded by newspaper \"Marca\" to the goalkeeper with the lowest goals-to-games ratio.

        "text": "The Australia cricket team toured Bangladesh in August and September 2017 to play two Test matches. It was Australia's first tour to Bangladesh since 2011. Bangladesh won the first Test by 20 runs, their first ever victory against Australia in a Test match. Following the win, Bangladesh's captain Mushfiqur Rahim said \"It's a great feeling beating Australia, and I think it was a great effort by the boys\". Australia's Steve Smith said \"I think they're a dangerous side, particularly here at home\". Australia won the second Test by 7 wickets, therefore drawing the series 1-1.\nBackground.\nThe Australia cricket team were scheduled to tour Bangladesh from 28 September to 21 October 2015 to play a tour match and two Test matches.\nA day before the tour was scheduled to start, the Australian team did not leave their country as Cricket Australia (CA) received information about security concerns. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said that they were surprised by the delay. Sean Carroll, security manager for CA, meet with the Australian High Commissioner in Bangladesh and the Bangladesh government to discuss the concerns. Despite the ongoing concerns regarding the tour, Bangladesh announced their squad on 28 September. The BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury said that \"we are expecting all the matches to be played on schedule\". On 30 September the Australian cricketers were sent back to their state squads in readiness for the Matador Cup. The BCB said that \"the Bangladesh government has committed to additional security on top of the substantial and elaborate arrangements in the BCB's standard Security Plan for international cricket\".\nOn 1 October, Cricket Australia confirmed that the tour had been postponed with a view to re-arrange the matches for a later date. In April 2016, it indicated that it was hoping the tour would go ahead in 2017. In June 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed the tour would take place in August 2017.\nFollowing England's tour to Bangladesh in October 2016, James Sutherland, CEO of Cricket Australia (CA), said the chances of Australia playing in Bangladesh were \"quite high\". In April 2017, both CA and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) were negotiating the fixtures for the tour. Nizamuddin Chowdhury, the BCB's chief executive, said they \"are now working on the schedule and other details with CA\". In May 2017, security assessments took place. Later the same month, Cricket Australia sent a security team to Bangladesh to finalise arrangements for the tour.\nRepresentatives from both CA and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) undertook a pre-tour security visit on 24 July 2017. However, there was an ongoing pay dispute between Australian cricketers, CA and the ACA, with the BCB being informed of the possibility of the tour not going ahead. Earlier in July, the Australia A cricket team had pulled out of a tri-series tournament in South Africa because of the dispute. Australia's Test squad said they would attend a training camp in Darwin ahead of the series, but would not fly to Bangladesh unless there was a resolution to the pay dispute. On 1 August 2017, Australia's captain Steve Smith said that the pay negotiations were progressing, but they needed to be finalised before the tour starts. The following day, a deal was reached in the pay dispute, allowing for the Test series to go ahead as planned. The Australian team arrived in Bangladesh on 18 August 2017, under heavy security.\nPrior to the tour starting, the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium, the venue for the first tour match between the Australians and a BCB XI was waterlogged. The BCB looked at two alternative venues to play the fixture, in case the ground was not ready in time. However, one day before the scheduled start of the match, it was called off, because of the waterlogging.\nSquads.\nBefore the series started, Mitchell Swepson was added to the squad and Jackson Bird replaced James Pattinson. Mominul Haque was added to Bangladesh's squad for the first Test, after Mosaddek Hossain suffered an eye infection. Steve O'Keefe was added to Australia's squad ahead of the second Test, as a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was injured."

Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently two of the top three teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 26 out of the last 30 conference championship games, including each of the last 16. The two teams have met a total of 116 times dating back to 1955 and currently meet biannually as a part of WCC conference play, with the potential to play a third game in the WCC tournament and a fourth in the postseason. As of March 2022, they have met 20 times in the WCC Tournament but have never met in any postseason tournaments beyond the end of conference play. Saint Mary's has upset a number 1 ranked Zags squad twice – once in the 2019 WCC final as an unranked team and once in 2022 as #23 in Moraga.\nGame results.\nBelow is a complete list of series results, according to Sports Reference and GoZags.com."

        "text": "The Auburn–UAB men's basketball rivalry is a men's college basketball rivalry between the Auburn Tigers and the UAB Blazers. Despite its relative youth and a 15-year hiatus from 2000–2014, the rivalry remains one of the fiercest and most competitive in the state of Alabama. \nHistory.\nFormation and early games.\nAuburn University and University of Alabama at Birmingham first played in 1982, just four seasons after the creation of the UAB men's basketball program. The matchup originated as a supplementary event at the Birmingham–Jefferson Civic Center (BJCC) for Auburn fans in Birmingham on the night before the Iron Bowl football game was played at Legion Field, and was initially characterized as a \"friendly cage rivalry\". However, UAB's quick rise to national prominence led to the Auburn–UAB game gaining significance in its own right. Three of those first five games in the BJCC saw one of the two teams come in ranked in the top 25, and the 1984 game remains the third-largest home crowd in UAB basketball history. The turnout in the early years was sizable; the lowest turnout in the first four matchups was 15,502, all played at Birmingham-Jefferson Coliseum. The 1989 game was the first to be played in Auburn.\nFollowing a one-year break, Auburn and UAB played each other for 12 consecutive seasons. UAB was dominant during this period, winning eight out of ten games from 1989–1997. The 1997 and 1998 editions of the rivalry were played in the Holiday Hardwood Classic at the BJCC as part of a doubleheader with Alabama.\nIn the lead-up to the 1996 matchup, \"The Anniston Star\" reported that various \"subplots\" added \"a touch of drama\" to the Auburn–UAB rivalry. That year, Auburn senior Wes Flanigan, an all-SEC point guard whose battle with cancer had received national media attention, was playing his first game since his diagnosis.\nHiatus.\nFollowing their 1999 matchup, Auburn head coach Cliff Ellis wanted the series to be played at Auburn until the number of games played in Auburn was equal to those played in Birmingham. UAB athletic director Gene Bartow and UAB head coach Murry Bartow refused to play the game exclusively in Auburn, so the series came to a halt. Despite pleas from both the media and the fans to continue the rivalry, no games were scheduled between the two programs for 15 seasons.\nRivalry renewal.\nIn May 2015, following UAB's NCAA tournament upset over 3-seed Iowa State and Bruce Pearl's first season at Auburn, UAB announced that they had reached an agreement to play Auburn in a four-game series. The first game would be played at Auburn, the second at UAB, then back at Auburn, then finally at Legacy Arena. (formerly the BJCC) Auburn won the first game of the series renewal in front of a sold out Auburn Arena, 75–74, on a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the game. In 2016, Auburn defeated UAB in the first game played at Bartow Arena in the series since 1996, 74–70. Auburn lead the entire game in a 85–80 victory to tie the series at 10 games apiece in 2017. Carrying a #8 ranking into the 2018 matchup, Auburn managed to survive a scare from UAB in overtime at Legacy Arena, 75–71, completing the series sweep against the Blazers. Auburn and UAB have not met since."

Walker was quoted as saying \"“I did not think I’d enjoy things if I moved. If you are not enjoying it you are not going to play well, so I stayed at school and joined Quins full-time after I left.\".\nHe played for Zebre in 2019-20 Pro14 season.\nAhead of the 2020-21 RFU Championship Season, Walker signed for Ealing Trailfinders, a team he had briefly signed for on loan before breaking into the Harlequins first team.\nWalker played for the England 7s in Hong Kong and Japan during the 2013 Circuit."

The Tigers held matches at the Huey P. Long Field House and starting in 1937 at the John M. Parker Coliseum.\nIn LSU's first season, they had a record of 5-2 and 6-1 in the ensuring 1931 campaign. In 1934, LSU won its first Southeastern Conference title by beating rival Tulane. Late in the 1930s, LSU won additional SEC titles and finished with a second-place finish in the 1939 NCAA Tournament and a third-place finish in 1940 NCAA Tournament. Some Tiger stalwarts during this period were Heston Daniel, Al Michael, Snyder Parham and Dub Robinson. World War II interrupted the sport, but LSU returned to varsity boxing in 1948.\nThe 1949 season, LSU's second season after the war, proved to be its best. Paced by individual national champions Wilbert \"Pee Wee\" Moss and Edsel \"Tad\" Thrash and coached by Jim Owen, the Tigers went undefeated in regular season play. They finished the year by beating South Carolina in front of 11,000 fans in Parker Coliseum to win its first and only national title. Boxing at LSU continued as a varsity sport during the early 1950s with boxers Calvin Clary, Thurman \"Crowe\" Peele and Bobby Freeman. Peele won the NCAA heavyweight title in 1955.\nLate in the decade, a dwindling number of schools in the region that sponsored boxing as a varsity sport led to higher travel costs for the LSU team. Ultimately, LSU announced in 1956 it would no longer support boxing on the varsity level.\nLSU recorded an all-time dual meet record of 101-22-6, one national championship, 31 individual conference champions, 11 individual NCAA champions and 12 NCAA runners-up.\nChampionships.\nTeam national championships.\nSources:"

        "title": "Premiership Women's Rugby",
        "text": "Premiership Women's Rugby, officially known as Allianz Premiership Women's Rugby or The Allianz PWR, is an annual semi-professional women's rugby union club competition at the highest level of the English rugby union system, and is run by the Rugby Football Union (RFU). It is contested by nine clubs who play two series of round-robin matches to determine the four participants of a single-elimination tournament. It began play in the 2017–18 season, superseding the former Women's Premiership, and introducing elements of professionalism in the sport's highest level. In its first six seasons, the competition was known as the Premier 15s. Gloucester-Hartpury are the current champions, while Saracens have won the most championships (3).\nPremiership Women's Rugby runs concurrently with the Allianz Cup, a similar annual competition contested by the same clubs, in which the teams are instead split into two pools, and only play one series of round-robin matches to determine places in the competition's tournament. The Allianz Cup began play in the 2021–22 season and has been won twice by Exeter Chiefs.\nHistory.\n2016–2023: Premier 15's.\nThe RFU founded the competition as \"Women's Super Rugby\" in October 2016, committing to a three-year, £2.4 million investment. A bidding process was opened to clubs seeking to operate a franchise in the new league, with the RFU initially planning to have all eight Women's Premiership teams and two new teams compete. Minimum standards were raised for aspiring franchise owners, such as requiring clubs to invest in professional training facilities and coaching resources. \nAfter interviews with twelve clubs at Twickenham Stadium, the RFU announced the league's ten foundation clubs in February 2017. The decision to admit all Premiership clubs (Aylesford Bulls Ladies being taken over by Harlequins to become Harlequins Ladies) except for Lichfield Ladies, despite their fifteen-year presence in the top flight, was controversial. As the club expressed being \"disgusted, disappointed and dumbfounded\", Leicester Tigers, and Member for Lichfield Michael Fabricant, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the decision, with the latter claiming the selection of only ten teams violated the Equality Act 2010, as the men's Premiership Rugby had twelve teams. The Thurrock T-Birds, who won the 2016–17 Championship 1 South season, also unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their exclusion. \nThe seven Premiership clubs would join Gloucester-Hartpury, Loughborough Lightning, and Waterloo in the inaugural season of the league, which had been rebranded to the \"Premier 15s\" prior to its start. Potato crisps manufacturer Tyrrells obtained its naming rights for three years, in what was described by the RFU as \"the biggest ever financial investment in women's club rugby.\"\nFinancial services company Allianz began their naming rights sponsorship ahead of the 2020–21 season. The two independent clubs, Richmond and Waterloo, were replaced with the Premiership Rugby-affiliated Exeter Chiefs and Sale Sharks. The RFU stressed the need for financially viable clubs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worcester Warriors were temporarily suspended during the 2022–23 season due to financial difficulties. These were resolved within a month and Worcester were unsuspended.\n2023 onwards: Premiership Women's Rugby.\nTrailfinders and Leicester Tigers were admitted into the league in the 2023–24 season, as the competition rebranded to \"Premiership Women's Rugby\". Sale Sharks and Worcester Warriors were initially excluded from the 2023–24 season alongside DMP Sharks and Wasps. Sale and Worcester were given conditional invitations by the RFU to rejoin for the 2023–24 season, in order to maintain the number of clubs in the league at ten.\nWithdrawal of Worcester Warriors Women.\nOn 17 October 2023 the owners of Worcester Warriors Women, Cube International, notified the RFU and PWR that they intended to withdraw Worcester Warriors Women from Premiership Women's Rugby and the Allianz Cup. The impact on the season's fixtures was not announced, however Worcester's next fixture, the Allianz Cup match against Bristol Bears Women was cancelled.\nTeams.\nTen were originally going to compete in the 2023-24 season of Premiership Women's Rugby and the Allianz Cup. This was reduced to nine following the withdrawal of Worcester.\nAll time.\nA total of 14 clubs have been involved in the top flight since the league's inception in the 2017–18 season. The most recent clubs to make debuts in Premiership Woman's Rugby were Trailfinders Women and Leicester Tigers Women, who made their top-flight debut in the 2023–24 season.\nFive clubs — Bristol, Gloucester-Hartpury, Harlequins, Loughborough and Saracens — have appeared in every season to date.\nBelow is a list of clubs that have participated in the competition and the number of full seasons they've competed in. Clubs currently active are marked in bold, while those that have been ever-present in are listed in bold italics. The last column shows the seasons each club has participated in, including the current one.&lt;br&gt;Note: The 2019–20 season is not counted as it was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nStructure.\nLeague season.\nThe Premiership Women's Rugby league season typically runs from September to June and comprises 18 rounds of matches, with each club playing each other home and away. In the 2023–24 season, each club also hadbye weeks. The results of the matches contribute points to the league as follows: \nPlayoffs.\nFollowing the completion of the regular season, the top 4 teams enter the playoffs, which are held in June. The top two teams receive home advantage, the league leaders hosting the 4th ranked team, and the 2nd place team hosting the 3rd place team. The winners of these semi-finals progress to the final, with no set venue, with the winner of the final being crowned champions. In the inaugural season, the play-offs comprised back-to-back home and away fixtures, with the winner being determined by an aggregate score. This was changed to single matches from the following season onwards.\nBroadcast.\nIn the 2022-23 season, at least two matches per round were streamed on the competition website. At least one of these matches will also be shown on the BBC iPlayer and BBC Red Button. Both semi-finals and the final were shown on the competition website, BBC iPlayer, and the BBC Red Button. As part of Harlequins Big Game double-header with Harlequins Men, TNT Sports broadcast one regular season game as well as both semi-finals and the final. Unlike the BBC, TNT Sports uses its own punditry and commentary for the matches they broadcast.\nFrom the 2023-24 season, TNT Sports gained broadcasting rights to one game per weekend as well as both the semi-finals and the final. As part of the deal, there is provision for a free-to-air provider to show both the semi-finals and final. The competition CEO Belinda Moore revealed that discussions to try to gain a terrestrial broadcaster for the competition were ongoing. The same game shown by TNT sports will be aired by The Rugby Network in the United States and Canada and by RugbyPassTV outside of the UK, Ireland, US, and Canada. BBC Sport and BBC iPlayer began showing select games from round 13 onwords."

In 2017, they were selected as a franchise for the inaugural Premier 15s season.\nHistory.\nLSWRFC were initially founded in the late 1970s during a boom in women playing rugby at universities across England. In 1983, Loughborough Students were one of the founder members of the Women's Rugby Football Union, set up to regulate women's rugby throughout the British Isles. Two years later, they hosted the American touring Wiverns rugby team and provided a number of players to the Midlands Select XV that played against the Wiverns on their tour. In 2009, Loughborough worked with the Nottingham Rugby Union in order to promote more men coming to Loughborough matches. When the British Universities and Colleges Sport rugby union leagues were formed in 2004, Loughborough won the league for the first three consecutive years.\nIn 2016, Loughborough Lightning bid for a franchise in the new competition originally known as Women's Super Rugby and now as the Premier 15s, which was replacing the Women's Premiership. A year later it announced that Loughborough Lightning were successful in their bid for a place in the top flight of English women's rugby. This made them the only student team that was awarded a franchise to play in the league. This was controversial as Loughborough Lightning had not previously played in the RFUW leagues and Lichfield Ladies who had been in the Women's Premiership for 15 years were excluded."

He scored Auckland's first ever try against a British Isles side in the first match, and was in the team less than a week later for the second; the second match resulted in a 4–0 loss for the tourists. He continued representing Auckland until 1891, and the following year was living in the Taranaki, for whom he played provincial rugby that season.\nThe following year he was back in Auckland and playing for the Auckland Suburbs club. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded by the majority of New Zealand's provincial unions (with the exceptions of Canterbury, Otago, and Southland), and in 1893 the newly formed national union organised a New Zealand representative team to tour Australia. McKenzie was not originally able to tour, but traveled to Australia late in the tour to bolster the tourists following some injuries. He played in two matches, including one against New South Wales.\nMcKenzie returned to the Auckland team in 1894 and played against the touring New South Wales side.

        "title": "Cycling in Penang Island",
        "text": "Cycling in Penang Island refers to the use of bicycles in the city of George Town and elsewhere on Penang Island, Malaysia, either for recreational, touring or transportation purposes. While bicycles have long been in use in Penang, with rickshaws becoming a unique application of the pedal-driven vehicle in the state, the usage of bicycles has noticeably declined since the late 20th century due to the proliferation of cars as the main transportation mode.\nIn recent years, initiatives have been taken by the Penang state government, the Penang Island City Council and the private sector to revive and encourage the use of bicycles within Penang Island. These efforts, part of the wider push for greener transportation modes and to reduce traffic congestion, include the ongoing construction of cycling lanes within George Town and the introduction of a public bicycle sharing service. Local cycling activists have also organised a handful of utility and recreational cycling activities within the city.\nBackground.\nBicycles have been in use in the former British crown colony of Penang for over a century. For instance, it was recorded that in a single week in 1896, Britain exported almost 25,000 bicycles throughout the British Empire, with over 100 destined for Penang, then part of the Straits Settlements.\nHowever, cycling was initially a recreational activity enjoyed only by the European elites. Although the prices of bicycles were dropping dramatically, it was not until the 1920s when bicycles finally became affordable for the poorer Europeans and the larger Asian community, as cheaper Japanese models flooded the market. Cycling as a sport only took off in Penang in the mid-20th century.\nMeanwhile, bicycles in Penang also spawned a unique mode of transportation - the trishaw, colloquially known in Malay as \"'beca\"'. In the early 20th century, the trishaw became ubiquitous in the cities of the Straits Settlements, namely Penang, Singapore and Malacca. To this day, the trishaw, an icon synonymous with colonial Penang, is still in use in George Town, albeit mostly for sightseeing rides by tourists.\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, the proliferation of cars, exacerbated by federal government policies which encouraged the nascent national automotive industry, led to the decline of utility cycling in Penang. As a result, Penang has an abnormally high vehicle ownership rate, which stood at 1.06 cars per person in 2006 and rose to 1.4 in 2013. Another study also found that 56% of Penangites preferred driving as their main transportation mode to work or school.\nWith traffic congestion around George Town and other urban centres such as Bayan Lepas worsening, the Penang state government launched in 2016 the Penang Bicycle Route Master Plan in order to promote cycling as a healthier and more environmentally-friendly transportation mode, as well as to reduce the public's reliance on cars. The Penang state government also hoped to make Penang the first cycling state in Malaysia, and to revolutionise Penang's public transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure and initiatives.\nThe Penang Bicycle Route Master Plan envisages a minimum of of dedicated cycling paths within Penang Island by 2020. All in all, a total of of dedicated cycling routes has been planned , with the first phase of the master plan, a coastal cycling path from George Town to Queensbay Mall, already completed.\nThe completed coastal cycling path between George Town and Queensbay Mall to the south also includes a route between Komtar and Karpal Singh Drive, and a 70-metre-long concrete-and-steel bridge across the Pinang River. Much of the path runs along the eastern shoreline of Penang Island, specifically at Jelutong and Gelugor, thus offering scenic seaside views. The path is physically separated from the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway alongside it and fenced off to minimise traffic hazards to cyclists. Into the city centre, the cycling path has been painted green and are also shared with pedestrians.\nIn addition to the future routes round Penang Island, sidewalks along certain streets within George Town's UNESCO World Heritage Site, such as Pitt Street, have also been painted green for similar purposes. There is also another existing cycling path at Tanjung Bungah, running for between Flamingo Hotel by the Beach and Dalat International School.\nIn 2017, cyclist crossing lights have been installed at certain locations within the city centre as a measure to improve the safety of cyclists, especially when crossing busy intersections.\nBeginning in 2020, Penang's city council began painting orange boxes at the beginning of roads where traffic wait for traffic lights. The purpose of these coloured boxes is to offer both motorcyclist and cyclist a designated space segregated away from cars. \nBicycle rental services.\nIn recent years, bicycle rental services have been marketed within George Town by a number of private companies. These cater mainly to tourists wishing to tour the numerous attractions within the city centre's UNESCO World Heritage Site on bicycles.\nIn 2016, LinkBike, a public bicycle-sharing service jointly funded by the Penang Island City Council and a private firm, was launched, making George Town the first city in Malaysia to implement such a system. It requires the use of smartphones to rent a bicycle at any one of the 25 electronic LinkBike stations within George Town.\nPortability on public buses.\nFoldable bicycles, of a maximum dimension of in length and in height, are allowed on board Rapid Penang buses.\nCycling activism.\nLocal cyclists have also responded by organising group cycling activities within Penang Island. Some of these activities include the weekly BikeonFriday (BoF) and the annual Campaign for a Lane (CFOL)."

        "text": "The Kent State Golden Flashes women's golf team is an intercollegiate sport at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The program was established in 1998 and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). Through the 2022–23 season, the Flashes have won 25 conference titles, all consecutively. Kent State is the only school to win the Mid-American Conference Women's Golf Championships, and has had team members win individual medalist honors in 20 of those years. The 25 consecutive MAC titles are a conference record for consecutive titles in any sport. In addition to their conference titles, Kent State has made 22 consecutive appearances in the NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championships, winning one regional title, advancing to the championship round seven times, and to the final match play round twice. The program's highest national finish is a tie for 5th in 2017 and 2018.\nWindmill Lakes Golf Club in Ravenna serves as the program's home course and occasionally hosts matches. The main practice facility is the Page and Ferrara Golf Training and Learning Center, a building located in Franklin Township, which the team shares with the men's golf team. The facility includes a outdoor practice range, outdoor practice tees, and outdoor short-game practice areas as well as an indoor putting and chipping area, a video analysis room, and a Science and Motion Putt lab. In addition, the rear of the facility features heated stalls which allow team members to access the driving range year-round.\nThe Flashes' head coach is Casey VanDamme, who was hired in August 2021. VanDamme came from South Dakota State University, where he had previously served as the head coach for both the men's and women's golf programs. He is the Flashes' fourth head coach, succeeding Lisa Strom, who left in July 2021 to take the head coaching job at Ohio State. Strom was hired at KSU in July 2019 as the program's third head coach and replaced Greg Robertson, who left for Oklahoma State following the 2018–19 season. Prior to Robertson, the team was coached by Mike Morrow from its inception until 2013, then by men's golf coach Herb Page on an interim basis for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.\nHistory.\nPlans for the team were first explored in 1995 as Kent State began looking into ways to increase women's athletic opportunities to be in compliance with Title IX. The university ultimately decided to add women's soccer for 1997, golf for 1998, and tennis for 1999, though the tennis team was never realized. Mike Morrow, a Kent State alumnus who had played on the KSU men's golf team in the 1970s, was hired as the women's golf program first head coach in September 1997. The team played in their first match one year later, placing fourth out of 13 teams in the Mary Fossum Invitational at Forest Akers Golf Courses in East Lansing, Michigan, on September 12 and 13, 1998. In their second tournament one week later, the Flashes finished second out of 20 teams in the Huskie Classic in Genoa, Illinois, and the following week, Kent State claimed its first tournament win in program history, winning the Lady Falcon Invitational in Bowling Green, Ohio, held September 26 and 27. The Flashes won the inaugural Mid-American Conference Women's Golf Championships the following April, winning the team title by 25 strokes. Jan Dowling was MAC medalist, with teammates finishing second and tied for third in the individual competition. The 2008 MAC championship set the conference record for largest margin of victory, with KSU winning by 66 strokes.\nThrough the 2024 season, Kent State has won over 50 tournaments, including 25 MAC championships. Mike Morrow coached the team from its establishment in 1998 until January 2013, midway through the 2012–13 season, when he announced his retirement. Under Morrow, the team played in 166 events and won 31 of them, including 14 MAC championships, and advanced to the NCAA tournament 12 times, reaching the championship round in five of those years. Morrow was replaced for the remainder of the 2012–13 season by men's golf coach Herb Page on an interim basis, who guided the team to its 15th-consecutive MAC championship and 13th-consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament. Greg Robertson, who had previously served as a women's golf assistant coach at Purdue, was hired as head coach in May 2013. In his six seasons as head coach, Robertson led the team to 26 team titles including a program-best six titles in 2015–16 and 2018–19. Included in the total are six more MAC championships and six appearances in the NCAA regional tournament, along with a regional title in 2019. The 2017 team advanced to the championship round for the first time since 2010 and had their best finish in program history, finishing in a tie for fifth after advancing to the match play round.\nMAC championships.\nThe Mid-American Conference added women's golf as a sponsored sport beginning in the 1998–99 season, with Kent State one of seven conference schools to begin offering the sport that season at the varsity level. The inaugural Mid-American Conference Women's Golf Championship was held in April 1999, which the Flashes won by 25 strokes. Through the 2024 championship, Kent State is the only conference member to ever win the conference meet, winning all 25 titles that have been contested. During the streak, the Flashes have won the tournament by as many as 66 strokes in 2002 and as few as four strokes in 2016, and have claimed the individual conference title in 20 of those years, including co-medalist titles in 2024. Their 18th consecutive title in 2016 set a new MAC record for consecutive conference titles by a single school in any sport. \nNCAA tournament.\nKent State has made 23 consecutive appearances in the regional round of the NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championships through 2022, making their first tournament in 2001. They have advanced to the championship round eight times, most recently in 2021. The program's best placements were in 2017 and 2018 when they advanced to match play and finished tied for fifth nationally. Their previous best finish was in 2001, when the Flashes placed 15th in the championship round.\nAwards.\nThe Mid-American Conference has four awards, which are selected at the conference championship: Sportswoman of the Year, Golfer of the Year, Freshman of the Year, and Coach of the Year, along with the first team all-MAC, second team all-MAC, and all-tournament team. Sportswoman of the Year is selected by fellow players, while the other awards and honorary teams are selected by a vote of the head coaches. Pimnipa Panthong became the first player in conference history to win both the Golfer of the Year and Freshman of the Year honors, claiming both in 2017. \nFacilities.\nThe team's home course is Windmill Lakes Golf Club, located approximately east of Kent in Ravenna, which has also been used by the men's golf team since 1978. Windmill Lakes is a par 70 course measuring . It is mainly used for practices and while it has yet to be used for a women's golf tournament, it has hosted occasional men's tournaments, including the Mid-American Conference Men's Golf Championships in 1984 and 1993 and the FirstEnergy Intercollegiate as recently as 2008.\nThe main training facility for both KSU golf teams is the Ferrara and Page Golf Training and Learning Center, located in Franklin Township adjacent to the southern boundary of the former KSU Golf Course, less than north of Dix Stadium. The facility, named after men's head coach Herb Page and philanthropists Emilio and Margaret Ferrara, includes a outdoor putting green, a practice range, along with practice fairways and tee areas, and heated bays that allow outdoor practice during winter months. Inside is a practice green, team locker rooms, video room, offices, weight room, and a lounge and study area."

        "text": "The Gabba, also known as Brisbane Cricket Ground, is an Australian sports stadium located in the Brisbane, Queensland suburb of Woolloongabba. It was first used in 1895 and is the home ground of the Queensland cricket team. It has been used for international cricket since 1931 when the ground hosted its first Test match. The first One Day International at the ground was held in 1979 and in 2006, the ground hosted its first Twenty20 International match. Women's international cricket was first played on the ground in 1985.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test and One Day International matches.\nTwo five-wicket hauls were taken during the first Test match played on the ground, both by Australian bowlers. Bert Ironmonger took five wickets for a cost of 42 runs (5/42) in South Africa's first innings of the match before his team-mate Tim Wall took 5/14 in their second innings. The best Test match bowling figures at the Gabba are the 9/52 taken by New Zealander Richard Hadlee in 1985, the only time that a bowler has taken nine wickets in an innings in international cricket on the ground. His innings bowling analysis was the fourth best in any Test match at the time and his match figures of 15/123 are the best in international cricket on the ground.\nThe first five-wicket haul in a One Day International match on the ground was taken by West Indian Anderson Cummins against India in 1992, when he took five wickets for 31 runs. The best ODI bowling figures at the venue are England's Chris Woakes' 6/56 taken against Australia in 2012. no five-wicket hauls have bee taken in Twenty20 Internationals or in any form of women's international cricket on the ground.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nFive-wicket hauls have been taken 84 times in Test matches at the Gabba.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nNine five-wicket hauls have been taken in men's ODIs on the ground."

Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference.\nA chain of lost recruiting classes, coaching personnel changes, losses against low RPI teams, no wins against Top 50 RPI teams, and a graduating core of players resulted in a downturn in the team's fortunes.

As the No. 8 seed in the A-10 tournament, the Rams defeated Dayton in the second round before losing to Rhode Island in the quarterfinals.\nThe Rams failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2010, and failed to achieve a 20-win season for the first time since 2006.

VCU defeated George Mason and Richmond in the A-10 tournament to advance to the championship game, where they lost to Rhode Island. They earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 10 seed in the West Region. There they lost to No. 7 Saint Mary's in the first round.\nHead coach Will Wade resigned on March 20 to take the head coaching position at LSU following the firing of Johnny Jones. Wade was the head coach for the two seasons, making him VCU's shortest tenured head coach since Benny Dees.

At the time of the trial he was playing semi-professional rugby union with Fylde after being released from a scholarship with Leigh Centurions. He made his professional début on 19 March 2017, scoring a try against Huddersfield Giants in a 16–16 draw.\nClub career.\nWigan Warriors.\nFollowing the departure of Josh Charnley to the Sale Sharks, and injuries to first team wingers Joe Burgess, Lewis Tierney and Dom Manfredi, Davies got his début against Huddersfield. After scoring on début he kept his place despite the return of Burgess and Tierney. He then scored a brace of long range tries against the Catalans Dragons. Further tries against Swinton, St. Helens and Hull FC helped him to a total of 14 tries in his rookie season.\nAfter an impressive rookie season, Davies was handed the number 2 shirt at the Wigan club replacing the injured Dominic Manfredi. Davies scored Wigan's first try of the year with a diving effort against the Salford Red Devils followed by further tries against Widnes and Wakefield followed by a brace against Huddersfield to give him five tries in six appearances. His next try came four games later against Warrington at the Magic Weekend after Morgan Escare scooped up a loose pass and selflessly passed the ball to Davies rather than running to the line himself. Further tries came against Leeds, Warrington, Huddersfield, Wakefield and a 50m solo run against Castleford. After four games without scoring he scored a try in the derby against St Helens from a seemingly impossible position with two tacklers holding him up 2m from the line, but drove forward and reached out to plant the ball on the white line just after halftime to halt a potential Saints fightback. Known for his aggressive ball carrying he averaged 148m per game as well as averaging 3 tackle breaks and a clean break per match. Following his early season form he was called up to the England Knights Performance Squad before signing a new five year deal with the Wigan Warriors just a year after making his debut despite only recently signing a new improved deal.\nHe played in the 2018 Super League Grand Final victory over the Warrington Wolves at Old Trafford.\nCatalans Dragons.\nIn round 5 of the 2021 Super League season, he scored a hat-trick for Catalans in their victory over Wakefield Trinity.\nOn 9 October, Davies played for Catalans in their 2021 Super League Grand Final defeat against St. Helens.\nOn 14 October 2023, Davies played in Catalans 2023 Super League Grand Final loss against Wigan.

Later that year he was selected for the England Knights on their tour of Papua New Guinea. He played against Papua New Guinea at the Lae Football Stadium. Davies also played against PNG at the Oil Search National Football Stadium.\nOn 25 June 2021 he made a try-scoring début for England in their 24-26 defeat to the Combined Nations All Stars, staged at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, Warrington, as part of England’s 2021 Rugby League World Cup preparation.\nHe scored his second try for England in the 10-30 win over France on 23 Oct 2021, staged in Perpignan."

Their head coach was Matt Doherty. The team captain for this season was Brendan Haywood. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nRoster.\nFingleton had back surgery in August 2000, but was unable to practice with the team until midway into the season.\nSchedule and results.\nThis season was Doherty's first year as head coach, after the retirement of Bill Guthridge. He was formally announced as head coach on July 11, 2000.\nThe Tar Heels started the season ranked sixth in the AP Poll. After suffering back to back losses from Michigan State and an upset loss against an unranked Kentucky, the Tar Heels went on an 18-0 undefeated run, including an undefeated 11-0 run in conference play. During this run, the Tar Heels were ranked number one in the AP Poll; this Tar Heel team was the first team Doherty coached that reached that achievement. Despite losses to Clemson, Virginia, and eventual national champions Duke in return fixtures, the Tar Heels won a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title.\nThe Tar Heels were the number one seed in the 2001 ACC men's basketball tournament, held that year in Atlanta, Georgia. They defeated Clemson and Georgia Tech in the semifinals and finals, respectfully, before falling to Duke in the final.\nSeeded second in the South Region for the NCAA Tournament, the Tar Heels defeated fifteenth-seeded Princeton in New Orleans, Louisiana before falling to seventh-seeded Penn State in a surprise upset.\nThe Tar Heels would end the season ranked sixth in the AP Poll and fifth in the Coaches Poll.\nOn March 30, 2001, Doherty was named the AP Coach of the Year. He was the first coach to win this honor in his first season coaching a team since Kelvin Sampson in 1995.\n!colspan=12 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

It is ranked as the third best nation in the South Asian region behind India, Pakistan and ranked in the world.\nSri Lanka was once considered as a better side in 1970s but failed to perform well at the international level for about four decades. The field hockey team from Sri Lanka participated in the Hockey World League for the first time in their history when they took part in the 2016–17 Men's FIH Hockey World League Round 1 and they performed really well by defeating every team that they had played in pool matches. They also qualified for the finals of the Hockey World League Round 1 in the Asian category. In the finals Sri Lanka played a draw in full-time against China, with 3 goals from each team. China went on to win the final by scoring 4-2 in the penalty shootout and Sri Lanka secured the silver medal at the end of Round 1 competition. After emerging as runners-up the Sri Lankan team qualified to play in the 2016-17 Men's FIH Hockey World League Round 2. But Sri Lanka could not manage to win even a single game and crashed out from the FIH Hockey World League. In Round 2 Sri Lanka secured 7th place by beating Fiji in the 7th place playoff.\nIn 2016, Sri Lanka made history by qualifying to play in the finals of the Asian Hockey Federation Cup. This was the first time Sri Lanka qualified to play in the finals of the Asian Hockey Federation Cup. In the finals Sri Lanka lost 0-3 to Bangladesh and secured the silver medal.\nSri Lanka also qualified to compete at the 2018 Asian Games in the men's team event after a third place finish in the Asian Games qualification round"

        "text": "The CONCACAF Nations League (, ) is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the member associations of CONCACAF, the regional governing body of North America. The tournament takes place on dates allocated for international friendlies on the FIFA International Match Calendar. A one-time qualifying tournament took place from September 2018 to March 2019 and the inaugural tournament began in September 2019.\nHistory and format.\nThe tournament was announced in November 2017. It is divided into three tiered leagues, A, B, and C, of four groups each, with promotion and relegation between the leagues based on finishing position within groups. The group winners of League A enter a four-team knockout competition to be crowned champion, while the group winners of Leagues B and C are promoted to the next tier. In Leagues A and B, the four teams at the bottom of the groups are relegated to the next lower tier. The tournament also determines which national teams qualify for the next edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\nThe format proposals were first formally investigated at the XXXII CONCACAF Ordinary Congress in Oranjestad, Aruba on 8 April 2017 and confirmed by CONCACAF on 16 November 2017. CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani stated that the purpose of the competition is to have a regular schedule of international fixtures for CONCACAF's national teams, noting that some teams play fewer than 10 games in a four-year period and needed more competitive games to assist the sport's development in those nations.\nAdjustment from 2023–24.\nOn 28 February 2023, CONCACAF announced a format change for the 2023–24 season of the CONCACAF Nations League. As a result, no teams will be relegated from the 2022–23 season.\nThe size of League A will be increased from 12 to 16 teams, and will now feature a quarter-final round. The 12 lowest-ranked teams in the CONCACAF Rankings of March 2023 will enter the group stage, now using a Swiss-system tournament format. The teams will be divided into two groups of six teams, with each team playing four matches against group opponents (two at home and two away). The top four teams will advance to the quarter-finals and will be joined by the four top-ranked teams in the CONCACAF Rankings. The teams advancing from the group stage will be drawn into ties against the top-ranked teams, which will be played on a two-legged home-and-away basis.\nLeague B will remain unchanged, featuring sixteen teams divided into four groups of four. Each team will play six matches in a double round-robin home-and-away format (three at home and three away). Following the format change, League C will be reduced from 13 to nine teams and four to three groups. Teams will be divided into three groups of three teams, with each team playing four matches in a double round-robin home-and-away format (two at home and two away).\nPromotion and relegation will resume for the 2023–24 season, with the fifth and sixth-placed teams in League A and the fourth-placed teams in League B being relegated for the next season. The group winners of Leagues B and C will be promoted, as will the best second-placed team of League C.\nTrophy.\nThe CONCACAF Nations League trophy was unveiled eight days before the inaugural Nations League Finals. The trophy represents all 41 CONCACAF national associations and is made of silver-plated brass and stone. The trophy weighs and is tall.\nSeasons.\nEach season of the CONCACAF Nations League is typically played from September to November (league phase), and March or June of the following year (Nations League Finals of League A). An exception was made in the 2022–23 season when the league phase was played from June 2022 to March 2023, due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup played in Qatar at the end of the year.\nBroadcasters.\nInternational.\nAll matches are streamed through CONCACAF's streaming service CONCACAF GO."

        "title": "Duke Riley (American football)",
        "text": "Duke Riley (born August 9, 1994) is an American football linebacker for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at LSU.\nEarly years.\nRiley attended John Curtis Christian High School in River Ridge, Louisiana. He committed to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play college football.\nCollege career.\nRiley played at LSU from 2013 to 2016. After spending his first three seasons as a backup, he became a starter for the first time his senior year in 2016. That season, he had 93 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and one interception and was named the team's MVP.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn November 16, 2016, it was reported that Riley had accepted an invitation to play in the Reese's Senior Bowl, joining LSU teammates Tre'Davious White, Ethan Pocic, Travin Dural, and Kendell Beckwith. On January 2, 2017, it was announced by Lil' Wayne on Instagram that Riley had signed with his company Young Money APAA Sports, and had successfully merged with his Young Money Entertainment record label. He became the company's first client they represented. He had an impressive week of practices at the Senior Bowl under Cleveland Browns head coach Hue Jackson, showing athleticism, quick instincts, and range. On January 28, 2017, Riley recorded a team-high seven combined tackles (four solo), helping the South defeat the North 16–15. His overall performance was spectacular during the 2017 Senior Bowl and was thought to immensely improve his draft stock. He received an invitation to the NFL Combine and completed nearly all of the required drills, but opted to skip the short shuttle and three-cone drill. On April 5, 2017, Riley participated at LSU's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only perform positional drills. Over 125 team representatives and scouts attended, including head coaches Sean Payton (New Orleans Saints), Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers), Mike Mularkey (Tennessee Titans), Todd Bowles (New York Jets), and Jim Caldwell (Detroit Lions). Riley opted to run the 40-yard dash (4.64), 20-yard dash (2.67), and 10-yard dash again while also performing positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Riley was projected to be a second to fourth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the seventh best outside linebacker by NFLDraftScout.com. \nAtlanta Falcons.\n2017.\nThe Atlanta Falcons selected Riley in the third round (75th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was reunited with former LSU teammate Deion Jones who Riley looked at as a role model as an elite linebacker at LSU. Riley also wore number 0 at the Senior Bowl to hopefully begin a tradition that began with Jones when he was the first player to wear the number 0 in a Senior Bowl.\nOn May 11, 2017, the Falcons signed Riley to a four-year, $3.51 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $889,752.\nThroughout training camp, Riley competed with De'Vondre Campbell, Josh Keyes, J'Terius Jones, and Jermaine Grace for the starting weakside linebacker position. Head coach Dan Quinn named him the backup weakside linebacker to veteran De'Vondre Campbell to begin the season.\nHe earned his first start in the Falcons' season-opener against the Chicago Bears and made six combined tackles in the 24–17 victory. Riley earned his first career start at weakside linebacker with De'Vondre Campbell starting at the strongside linebacker position over Vic Beasley. Duke Riley, De'Vondre Campbell, and Deion Jones were the starting linebacker corp in the Atlanta Falcons' big base package. Unfortunately, Riley missed four tackles during the game, but played 49 out of 67 defensive snaps. On October 22, 2017, Riley recorded a solo tackle in a 23–7 loss to the New England Patriots, but left the game after tearing his meniscus. He underwent successful surgery to repair the tear and missed the next four games (Weeks 8 to 11). He finished his rookie season in 2017 with 30 combined tackles (15 solo) in 12 games and six starts.\nThe Atlanta Falcons finished third in the NFC South with a 10–6 record and earned a wildcard berth. On January 6, 2018, Riley appeared in his first career playoff game and made two combined tackles during a 26–13 victory at the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Wild Card Round. The following week, he made one tackle as the Falcons lost 15–10 in the NFC Divisional Round to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n2018.\nRiley had a disappointing 2018 campaign, and saw his role diminish throughout the season. Initially Riley entered training camp slated as the starting weakside linebacker, but saw minor competition for the role from Foyesade Oluokun, who ended up surpassing Riley on the depth chart. Head coach Dan Quinn named Riley the starting weakside linebacker to begin the regular season. He started the season alongside De’Vondre Campbell and middle linebacker Deion Jones. In Week 3, he collected a season-high 13 combined tackles (nine solo) during a 43-37 loss against the Saints. Riley began seeing a decreased snap count during the season and eventually lost his starting role to Foyesade Oluokun in Week 13 and remained a backup for the remainder of the season. He finished the season with 60 combined tackles (37 solo) and two pass deflections in 16 games and ten starts. He received an overall grade of 44.2 from Pro Football Focus, which ranked 87th among all qualifying linebackers in 2018.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn September 30, 2019, Riley was traded to the Eagles for safety Johnathan Cyprien and a swap of late-round picks. On January 2, 2020, Riley was named special teams captain for the Eagles Wild card match up with Seattle.\nIn Week 5 of the 2020 season against the Steelers, Riley led the team with 13 tackles (7 solo) and injured himself when forcing a fumble on tight end Eric Ebron and he had to be carted off the field. Without Riley, the Eagles lost 38–29.\nIn Week 14 against the Saints, Riley recorded his first interception off a pass thrown by Taysom Hill during the 24–21 win. He was placed on injured reserve on January 1, 2021. He finished the season with 55 tackles, one forced fumble and one interception through 13 games and eight starts.\nMiami Dolphins.\nRiley signed with the Miami Dolphins on March 22, 2021. He played in 16 games with three starts, recording 26 tackles primarily on special teams and a rotational linebacker.\nOn March 15, 2022, Riley signed a one-year contract extension with the Dolphins. He played in 17 games with two starts, recording 45 tackles, one sack and two passes defensed.\nOn March 16, 2023, Riley signed a two-year contract extension with Dolphins."

It was the season-ending event for the best singles players who were age 21 and under on the 2017 ATP World Tour.\nRules.\nA number of innovative rule changes were introduced in 2017 including best of five sets, first to four games in each set, tie break at 3-All, no-ad scoring (server’s choice) and no lets. There were amended rules regarding time, the match started five minutes from entry of second player onto court, a shot clock to ensure 25 second rule, a maximum of one medical timeout per player per match, limits on when coaches can talk to players and the public was allowed to move around during a match (except at baselines).\nIn September 2017, the ATP announced that there would be no line judges at the event. The only official on court was the umpire and all line calls were made by Hawk-Eye. All calls were therefore final; however, foot faults, which are usually called by the baseline official, could be challenged and would be reviewed by a camera monitoring the server's feet.\nQualification.\nThe top seven players in the \"Emirates ATP Race to Milan\" qualified. The eighth spot was reserved for an Italian wild card, determined at a qualifying tournament. Eligible players must be 21 or under at the start of the year (born in 1996 or later for 2017 edition). 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov was the youngest and only teenage player.\nAlexander Zverev withdrew from the tournament, as he would play the ATP Finals the following week.\nControversy.\nFor the tournament draw, players were asked to choose a female model to escort them onto the stage, and some of these models lifted or removed various articles of clothing to reveal a letter of the alphabet. This letter signified who would be playing whom. Widespread criticism followed. The ATP explained their choice, \"The intention was to integrate Milan's rich heritage as one of the fashion capitals of the world. However, our execution of the proceedings was in poor taste and unacceptable. We deeply regret this and will ensure that there is no repeat of anything like it in the future.\" "

        "text": "The 2018 Tour de France was the 105th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. The -long race consisted of 21 stages, starting on 7 July in Noirmoutier-en-l'Île, in western France, and concluding on 29 July with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris. A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won by Geraint Thomas of . Tom Dumoulin () placed second, with Thomas's teammate and four-time Tour winner Chris Froome coming third.\nThe opening stage was won by Fernando Gaviria of , who became the Tour's first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey. Peter Sagan () then took the race lead on the following stage. won stage three's team time trial, putting their rider Greg Van Avermaet in yellow. He held the jersey for eight days until the second stage of the three Alpine stages, which Thomas won and took the lead in. He successfully defended it from Dumoulin for the rest of the Tour, which included three stages in the Pyrenees and the penultimate stage's individual time trial, the latter won by Dumoulin.\nSagan, who won three stages, was placed first in the points classification for the sixth time. Julian Alaphilippe of , winner of two mountain stages, won the mountains classification, and 's Pierre Latour won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by , and Dan Martin of won the combativity award.\nTeams.\nThe 2018 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams. The race was the 25th of the 37 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its eighteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 6 January 2018, organisers of the Tour, the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams that received a wildcard invitation to participate in the event. The four teams were , , , from France, and Belgium's , all of which have participated in the race before. This meant that new French team , with their team leader, sprinter Bryan Coquard, missed out on the race. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place on in the town of La Roche-sur-Yon on 5 July, two days before the opening stage.\nNew rules by the cycling's governing body, the \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI), reduced the number of riders per team for Grand Tours from 9 to 8, resulting in a start list total of 176, instead of 198, which had been the number of starters since 2010. Of these, 35 competed in their first Tour de France. The riders came from 30 countries. Seven countries had more than 10 riders in the race: France (35), Belgium (19), the Netherlands (13), Italy (13), Australia (11), Germany (11) and Spain (11). The average age of riders in the race was 29.37 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Egan Bernal () to the 40-year-old Franco Pellizotti (). had the youngest average age while had the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nIn the lead up to the Tour, the favourite for the general classification was Chris Froome of . Froome had won the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 editions of the Tour, and was also the current defending champion at both other Grand Tours, the Vuelta a España and the Giro d'Italia. However, Froome's participation was unconfirmed due to an ongoing anti-doping investigation that began in December 2017, when it was announced that he had returned a urine sample taken at the Vuelta (which had taken place two months earlier) which contained twice his allowed amount of the asthma drug salbutamol. This was considered not as a positive doping result, but as an \"Adverse Analytical Finding\" (AAF), meaning that he was allowed to continue racing until the case was resolved. He did however face the possibility of losing his Vuelta victory and all subsequent results. The ASO were unhappy with the situation, which was very similar to that of the 2011 Tour pre-race favourite Alberto Contador, who started the tour with his case over a positive test for clenbuterol still unresolved. The UCI conducted an investigation into the AAF, which was still unresolved at the time that Froome won the Giro in May 2018. With an outcome before the start of the Tour unlikely, the ASO attempted to bar Froome from starting the race, citing article 28 of the race's rules, saying that the organiser \"expressly reserves the right to refuse participation in – or to exclude from – the event, a team or any of its members whose presence would be such as to damage the image or reputation of ASO or the event\". Froome was cleared by the UCI on 2 July, five days before the start of the Tour, with a press statement reading that the authorities had found sufficient evidence \"that Mr Froome's sample results do not constitute an AAF\". He was thereafter cleared to start the Tour by the ASO as well.\nThe closest rivals of Froome were thought to be Romain Bardet (), Tom Dumoulin (), Mikel Landa (), Vincenzo Nibali (), Richie Porte (), Nairo Quintana () and Adam Yates (). Porte's best result in the Tour was fifth overall in 2016. He had shown his form so far in the 2018 season by winning the general classification of Tour de Suisse. Although Quintana had placed twelfth overall in the 2017 Tour, his 2018 season so far had been consistent and he had finished second behind Froome in previous Tours. He came to the Tour with a strong team, which included contender Landa, who in 2018 had moved to Movistar from Sky after being a domestique for Froome. The 2017 Giro winner Dumoulin placed second in the 2018 Giro. Nibali had recently won the classic Milan–San Remo, one of cycling's five one-day race \"monuments\". He had however failed to impress in the stage races leading up to the Tour, finishing 24th in the Critérium du Dauphiné after finishing outside the top 10 in the general classifications at Dubai Tour, Tour of Oman and the Tirreno–Adriatico. He was the only rider on the start list apart from Froome to have won a Tour, the 2014 edition. Bardet finished second and third overall in the two previous Tours and placed third in the Critérium du Dauphiné leading up to the 2018 Tour. Yates' best overall Tour result was fourth 2016; he had shown his form during the season before the Tour with top-five placings in four stage races, including second in the Dauphiné.\nSome of the other riders considered as contenders for the general classification were Dan Martin (), Alejandro Valverde (), Rigoberto Urán (), Geraint Thomas () and Primož Roglič ().\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (), Michael Matthews (), Fernando Gaviria (), Marcel Kittel (), Mark Cavendish (), Dylan Groenewegen (), Arnaud Démare () and André Greipel (). Others expected to contend for sprint finishes included Greg Van Avermaet (), Alexander Kristoff (), Sonny Colbrelli (), Nacer Bouhanni () and John Degenkolb (). Triple reigning world road race champion Sagan had won the five previous points classifications of the Tour before his 2017 Tour disqualification after race officials judged that he caused Cavendish to crash. Sagan was again aiming to equal Erik Zabel's record of six points classifications. He was in good form during the season before the Tour, winning the one-day races Paris–Roubaix and Gent–Wevelgem, multiple top ten results one-day races and two points classifications in stage races. Matthews, who won the 2017 Tour's points classification, suffered an early season injury and his sole win for the season was at the Tour de Romandie. Kittel had won fourteen Tour stages, five in 2017, gained two wins so far in 2018, both at the Tirreno–Adriatico. Debutant Gaviria had been second to Kittel at before the latter moved to for the 2018 season. Gaviria amassed a total of seven wins so far in 2018, and additionally the points classification at the Tour of California. The 2011 points classification winner Cavendish's win at the Dubai Tour in February was his only of 2018 so far. Winner of the 2017 Tour's final stage Groenewegen had a total of nine victories for the season going into the Tour, with one coming at Paris–Nice. Démare, who led the points classification in the 2017 Tour, had gained two wins at Paris–Nice and the Tour de Suisse in 2018 before the Tour. Greipel, who turned 36 during the Tour, had taken six wins at stage races during 2018 before the Tour, as well as the points classification of the Tour of Belgium.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 12 February 2017, at a rugby union match between France and Scotland at Paris's Stade de France, race director Christian Prudhomme announced the opening stages of the 2018 Tour (known as the \"Grand Départ\") would take place in the Vendée department, in the Pays de la Loire region. Since the inaugural Tour in 1903, the Vendée has hosted the \"Grand Départ\" five times, with the last in 2011. Two weeks after the announcement, the ASO revealed that the \"Grand Départ\" would take place over three stages, with the third a team time trial. In June 2017, the UCI's Professional Cycling Council (PCC) moved the start of the Tour a week later than usual and originally planned due to a clash with the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The full route was announced on 17 October 2017; it was almost completely within France, with short deviations into Spain in the Pyrenees the only exceptions. Two of the Tour's most historic climbs featured, Alpe d'Huez and the Col du Tourmalet, which last featured in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Notable was stage nine's of sett paving, split across fifteen sectors, a feature that was last seen in the 2015 Tour. It finished in Roubaix, home of the \"monument\" race Paris–Roubaix. For the first time in 60 to 70 years, it included a section of unpaved roads on the Glières Plateau. Overall, the route was thought to offer something for all rider types.\nStage one began in the village of Noirmoutier-en-l'Île on the island of Noirmoutier, before heading along the coast of the Vendée department. The following two stages were loops, with the third taking the route north into the Maine-et-Loire department. The next three stages took place in the region of Brittany, ending with two laps of the short, but steep, climb in Mûr-de-Bretagne. The seventh, eighth and ninth stages headed north-east with finishes in Chartres, Amiens and Roubaix, respectively. A long transfer then moved the race to the Alps. Following three stages in the mountains, the Tour descended into the Drôme department and stage thirteen's finish in the city of Valence. The Massif Central highland region hosted stage fourteen, with the finish in Mende. The next two transitional stages took the race south-west to the Pyrenees across a continuous journey between Millau, Carcassonne and Bagnères-de-Luchon. After two Pyrenean stages, the eighteenth stage took place in the foothills between Trie-sur-Baïse to Pau. The next stage headed back into the mountains, before the penultimate stage, which took place close to the west coast in the French Basque Country. A long transfer took the Tour to its conclusion in Paris with the Champs-Élysées stage.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , the shortest of the 21st century up to that point. There were two time trial events, stage three's team time trial and stage twenty's individual time trial. Of the remaining nineteen stages, eight were officially classified as flat, five as hilly and six as mountainous. The longest mass-start stage was stage seven, at , and the shortest was stage seventeen, at . The aforementioned, a mountain stage, was the shortest since 1996 and began with a standing start grid formation, with positions based on riders general classification ranking. The grid formation was an innovation for the Tour, and with shorter distance, was beforehand universally welcomed, but it was thought to have made little effect on the race. There were summit finishes on stages stage eleven to La Rosière, stage twelve to Alpe d'Huez, and stage seventeen to the Col de Portet. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Col de Portet Pyrenean pass, the first time it had been used in the Tour. It was among nine \"hors catégorie\" (English: \"beyond category\") rated climbs in the race. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in Annecy, and fifteen, in Carcassonne.\nRace overview.\nFirst week: Northern stages.\nStage one's bunch sprint was won by Fernando Gaviria, with Peter Sagan coming in second place and Marcel Kittel in third. Gaviria took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Breakaway rider Kévin Ledanois () collected the most mountains classification points to take the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification. Sagan won stage two from a sprint to take the yellow and green jerseys, with Dion Smith of claiming the lead in the mountains classification. Stage three's team time trial was won by whose riders Tejay van Garderen and Greg Van Avermaet became tied for the overall lead, with Van Avermaet moving into yellow for the second time in his career due to him crossing the finish line ahead of Van Garderen in the first two stages being as there was not yet an individual time trial to measure their times down to the 1000th of a second. Stage four was won by Gaviria from a bunch sprint. Sagan further extended his lead in the points competition by winning stage five's uphill sprint finish in Quimper. Also in stage five, Toms Skujiņš of won the mountains points which gave him the polka dot jersey, becoming the first from Latvia to ever lead the mountains classification.\nIn stage six, which ended atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne climb, Dan Martin attacked with a kilometre remaining and was able to stay away take the victory one second ahead of a large group that the contained the general classification contenders. In the closing kilometres of the stage, Geraint Thomas won a three-second time bonus sprint that brought him to three seconds behind Van Avermaet in the general classification. Overall favourites Romain Bardet and Tom Dumoulin lost time as their tyres punctured late in the stage. The seventh stage was won by Dylan Groenewegen from a bunch sprint. There were multiple crashes in the first week of the Tour with six riders abandoning the race for various reasons, including the 2017 Tour points classification winner Michael Matthews. Groenewegen won a further bunch sprint in the eighth stage. In the sprint, André Greipel and Gaviria were penalised for headbutting each other and lost their stage placing and green jersey points. Stage nine's sett-paving sections caused many issues for the riders, including leading sprinters and two of the classification contenders. Richie Porte abandoned for the second year in a row after crashing in the opening . Rigoberto Urán initially tried to continue the race despite injuries sustained during a crash, but was forced to quit the race on the following stage. Chris Froome, his teammate Egan Bernal, Jakob Fuglsang, and Mikel Landa, crashed in the stage along with many other riders; numerous riders had tyre punctures as well, including three for Bardet. His teammate Alexis Vuillermoz was forced to abandon the stage after colliding with a spectator taking photographs. Meanwhile, Yves Lampaert (), John Degenkolb, and Van Avermaet were able escape the remaining riders from the peloton (main group) and together they contested a sprint finish, which was won by Degenkolb. Van Avermaet gained time, as well winning the time bonus sprint, to extend his lead in the general classification. The following day was the Tour's first rest day.\nSecond week: Alps and transition west.\nThe first stage in the high mountains and first in the Alps, the tenth, was won by rider Julian Alaphilippe, who attacked on his own with to go from a large breakaway group that included race leader Van Avermaet. The aforementioned retained the yellow jersey and extended his lead to 2 min 22 s, when pundits predicted the first day in the Alps would be his last as overall race leader. Alaphilippe also took lead of the mountains classification. Thomas achieved back-to-back wins both from the group of overall contenders on stages eleven and twelve by pushing the breakaway riders until the very end. In the steep summit finish of the eleventh, Thomas attacked in the final , passing lone breakaway rider Mikel Nieve () and managed to distance himself from Froome and Dumoulin by twenty seconds to take the win. On the twelfth stage, which was the final day in the Alps, Thomas won the sprint on the flat finish after the climb to Alpe d'Huez. 's Steven Kruijswijk was caught by the group of overall contenders in the final kilometres after he had launched a solo attack with remaining. Following the stage, the general classification top three was: Thomas in first position, Froome second, 1 min 39 s down, and Dumoulin third, a further 11 seconds behind. General classification contender Vincenzo Nibali, who was fourth overall, was forced to withdraw from the Tour following the stage after an incident near the summit of Alpe d'huez where he fell off his bike fracturing a vertebra taking Roglič down with him. It was initially suspected that the crash had been caused by a police motorcycle driving in front of him, but it later emerged that he became caught in a spectator's camera strap. Nibali's team management saw the lack of crowd control from the police and spectators lighting flares as contributing factors. Following the incident, Christian Prudhomme appealed to fans to show the riders more respect. Many riders left the Tour during the Alpine stages, either being forced to abandon due to fatigue and injury, or were disqualified for finishing outside the cut-off time; riders of note were the sprinters Mark Cavendish, Gaviria, Greipel, Groenewegen, and Kittel.\nSagan won stage thirteen with a surprise attack in the closing meters of the bunch sprint finish, while Alexander Kristoff and Arnaud Démare were together sprinting for the finish line. In stage fourteen, Omar Fraile of launched a late move from the large breakaway after the final climb to win at the Mende aerodrome; the breakaway finished eighteen minutes ahead of the peloton. Stage fifteen, the start of the final week, was once again a breakaway victory, with Magnus Cort taking 's second win in two days. The next day was the second rest day of the race. Following the stage, controversy arose around Team Sky rider Gianni Moscon, who had allegedly punched Fortune-Samsic rider Élie Gesbert during the opening part of the stage. After reviewing footage of the incident, the race jury disqualified him for 'particularly serious aggression'. A non-racing incident occurred during the sixteenth stage when hay bales were placed across the road by local farmers protesting about reductions to their subsidies. The police used tear gas to disperse them, and as the riders rode passed this area, there was still gas in the air. The race was subsequently neutralized for about fifteen minutes because several riders had problems with their eyes and had to rinse them. After the restart, a large breakaway escaped, and Philippe Gilbert (), while in the lead on a descent, lost control of his bicycle and crashed into and over a wall. Later, Adam Yates, having taken the lead, also fell. Gilbert finished the stage and collected the most combative rider award, but would not start the following day. Yates carried on, but was overtaken by Alaphilippe, who took his second stage victory.\nThird week: Pyrenees and finale in Paris.\nThe first of three stages in the Pyrenees, the seventeenth, opened with an uneventful grid formation, which saw the customary early formation of a breakaway group. Froome's challenge faded on the approach to the summit of the Col de Portet and he dropped to third position in the general classification, 2 min 31 s behind Thomas. Dumoulin moved into second place, 1 min 59 s off the lead. Nairo Quintana won the stage after attacking at the bottom of the final climb, moving himself up to fifth overall, behind Primož Roglič. The flat stage eighteen was won by Démare from a bunch sprint. By this point of the Tour, most of the top sprinters had left, and Démare had come close to missing the time cut in the previous stage along with Sagan, who had crashed heavily and was suffering with injuries. On the mountainous stage nineteen, Roglič attacked on the descent following the final climb, to a misty Col d'Aubisque, and soloed to the finish line nineteen seconds ahead of the chasing small group of overall favourites. Roglič took third place from Froome. Thomas was able to consolidate his overall position by picking up six bonus seconds by winning the sprint for second place, thereby extending his lead over Dumoulin to 2 min 5 s. The penultimate stage's individual time trial was won by Dumoulin, who finished one second ahead of Froome. Froome in turn managed to retake third place from Roglič. Thomas came third after surviving a scare when his back wheel locked, but completed the stage successfully, finishing fourteen seconds behind Dumoulin, taking a lead of 1 min 51 s into the final stage.\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Kristoff in a bunch sprint on the Champs-Élysées. Thomas won the race with no changes in the final stage. Froome came third overall, 2 min 24 s down on Thomas. Sagan won the points classification with a total of 477, 231 ahead of Kristoff in second. Alaphilippe won the mountains classification with 169 points, with the 2017 winner and French compatriot Warren Barguil () second with 80 points. The best young rider was thirteenth-placed overall Pierre Latour (), with fifteenth-placed overall Bernal second. finished as the winners of the team classification, 12 min 33 s ahead of second-placed . Of the 176 starters, 145 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nFour main individual classifications were contested in the 2018 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders received 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. Time bonuses of three, two and one seconds, were given to the first three riders to cross a \"bonus point\" in each of the first nine mass-start stages of the race. It would affect the general, but not the points classification. For crashes within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved received the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and \"hors catégorie\". Double points were awarded at the top of the last mountains in the three mountain stages in the three Pyreneean stages (the Col du Portillon, the Col de Portet and the Col d'Aubisque). The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but was restricted to riders born on or after 1 January 1993. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders on the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Dan Martin won the overall super-combativity award which was, again, awarded by a jury.\nA total of €2,287,750 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 160 were awarded money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The team classification winners were given €50,000. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col du Portet on stage seventeen, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage nineteen. Nairo Quintana won the Henri Desgrange and Julian Alaphilippe won the Jacques Goddet.\nUCI rankings.\nRiders from the WorldTeams competed individually and for their teams for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI road races. Both rankings used the same points scale, awarding points to the top sixty in the general classification, each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage, the top five finishers in each stage and for the top three in the final points and mountains classifications. The points accrued by Thomas moved him from 20th to second in the World Tour individual ranking and from 41st to fourth in the individual World Ranking. Sagan kept his position at the top of both rankings, with and Belgium also holding the lead of the World Tour team ranking and World Ranking nation ranking respectively."

        "text": "Kevin Charles King (born May 5, 1995) is an American football cornerback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Washington, where he was a four-year starter for the team as a safety and a cornerback. He was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft.\nDuring his time with Washington, King often played as both a safety and a cornerback where he was a multiple time All-Pac-12 Conference honorable mention his last two years with the team. He played for the Packers for five seasons.\nEarly years.\nKing was born in Oakland, California and attended Bishop O'Dowd High School. As a child, he played baseball, basketball, and football and originally wanted to play quarterback but at 5'7, could not see over the offensive line. During his time in high school, he was coached by Hardy Nickerson, who played for the Packers in 2002. As a junior in high school, he had experienced a growth spurt and grew to 6'2. He commented that this growth spurt made him stop playing baseball and focus on football, as he was not sure how well he could play shortstop with the few extra inches of height. Prior to his senior year, he was named defensive most valuable player (MVP) at the Oakland Nike Football Training Camp. He finished the season with six interceptions, leading the team. He was named to the first-team All-NorCal and first-team Division three all-state by MaxPreps.com. In addition, he also won accolades in track and field in the 110-meter high hurdles and the 300-meter hurdles.\nKing was highly recruited coming out of high school and was ranked as a three-star prospect by Rivals.com out of a possible five-star ranking, and as the number 73 overall recruit in California. He was recruited by Washington, California, West Virginia, and Arizona State. He stated that winning the MVP at the Nike Football Training Camp brought his \"confidence up a bit\" and that he now knew he could \"play with those top guys.\" He ultimately committed to play at Washington because he felt that he could come in and play early due to the large amount of junior and senior defensive backs. He chose to major in American ethnic studies and retail management.\nCollege career.\nKing played at Washington from 2013 to 2016. During his first year with the team, he played safety (although the team believed him to be more natural at cornerback) and saw snaps during each of the first seven games of the season. He was the first true freshman to start for the Huskies in 2013. He missed several games due to injury, including his first bowl game against BYU. Arguably his best game of the season came against the UCLA Bruins, where he finished with four tackles and a fumble recovery.\nHe continued to play safety his second year on the team and played in 13 games, starting 12 of them at the safety position. The only game he did not start was against Stanford, which he missed due to an illness. King recorded his first career interception in the Apple Cup against rival Washington State, and additionally recorded four tackles. He also forced another fumble, this time against Illinois. During the first bowl game of his college career, he registered nine tackles against Oklahoma State.\nKing continued to play well going into his junior year, as he made the switch to cornerback and recorded three interceptions in the first three games of the year playing in the nickel position. He had a team-high nine tackles (two for loss), a forced fumble, and a recovery against Washington State and finished the year sitting the bowl game out due to injury. His play resulted in him being made an honorable mention on the All-Pac-12 Conference team. Following this season, he considered coming out of school and declaring for the NFL draft but Huskies' co-defensive coordinator Jimmy Lake encouraged him to return for his senior year to build up more film as an outside corner which he believed was the most likely position he would play in the NFL.\nAs a senior, King started every game of the season at cornerback and finished the year with two interceptions, 44 tackles, and 3.5 for a loss. His efforts earned him a second All-Pac-12 honorable mention and an honorable mention on the Academic All-Pac-12 Team. One of his interceptions came against Arizona State in which he caught a one-handed interception on a fade pass from Manny Wilkins in a game that they ended up winning 44–18.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nKing attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed all of the combine drills. He ran the fastest three-cone drill and short shuttle of all defensive backs and tied for 11th among all defensive backs in the 40-yard dash. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, King was projected to be a first or second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the third best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, was ranked the fifth best cornerback by ESPN, was ranked the seventh best by \"Sports Illustrated\", and was ranked as the fifth best cornerback, along with Tre'Davious White, by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Green Bay Packers selected King in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. King was the sixth cornerback drafted in 2017. Packers director of football operations Eliot Wolf commented that he was excited to add someone with King's size to the team and that he was expected to come in and compete for a starting job right away.\nOn May 11, 2017, the Packers signed King to a four-year, $7.08 million contract that includes $4.67 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $3.28 million.\nKing was not able to attend organized team activities due to the leagues policy on colleges that followed the quarters system. Rookies are not able to join their team until their college has concluded their final semester. During that time frame, he worked heavily with cornerbacks coach Joe Whitt to get up to speed on the playbook over the phone and via Skype. Throughout training camp, King competed to a starting cornerback against Damarious Randall, Davon House, Quinten Rollins, and LaDarius Gunter. Head coach Mike McCarthy named King the fourth backup cornerback on the depth chart to start the regular season, behind Davon House, Damarious Randall, and Quinten Rollins.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Packers’ season-opening 17–9 victory against the Seattle Seahawks. On September 24, 2017, King earned his first career start after Davon House was sidelined due to a quadriceps injury. King finished the Packers’ 27–24 win against the Cincinnati Bengals with a season-high seven combined tackles (five solo). King was inactive for the Packers’ Week 6 loss at the Minnesota Vikings after suffering a concussion the previous game. He was sidelined for a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens due to a shoulder injury. He was also sidelined for a Week 13 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after aggravating his shoulder injury. On December 6, 2017, the Green Bay Packers officially placed King on injured reserve due a lingering shoulder injury. King spent the majority of the season dealing with a shoulder injury that at times prevented him from lifting his arm above his head and that dislocated multiple times during the season. The following week, King underwent surgery by Dr. James Andrews to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder. King finished his rookie season in 2017 with 28 combined tackles (22 solo) and five pass deflections in nine games and five starts.\n2018.\nKing rehabbed throughout the offseason and returned in time to participate in organized team activities. During training camp, King competed for a job as a starting cornerback against Davon House, Tramon Williams, Jaire Alexander, and Josh Jackson. Head coach Mike McCarthy named King and Tramon Williams the starting cornerbacks to start the regular season. King was inactive for two games (Weeks 3–4) due to a groin injury. On October 15, 2018, King made four solo tackles, broke up a pass, and made his first career interception during a 33–30 victory against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 6. King intercepted a pass by 49ers’ quarterback C. J. Beathard, that was originally intended for wide receiver Marquise Goodwin during the fourth quarter to seal the Packers’ victory. He suffered a hamstring injury in Week 9 and missed the next four games before being placed on injured reserve on December 5, 2018.\n2019.\nIn King's return from injury in Week 1, he made 5 tackles and sacked Mitchell Trubisky once as the Packers beat the Chicago Bears 10–3. In Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings, King recorded one tackle a pass breakup and a crucial fourth quarter interception in the end zone off a pass thrown by Kirk Cousins.\nIn Week 5 against the Dallas Cowboys, King recorded an interception off Dak Prescott in the 34–24 win.\nIn Week 16 against the Minnesota Vikings on \"Monday Night Football\", King recorded another interception off a pass thrown by Kirk Cousins which he returned for 39 yards during the 23–10 win.\n2020.\nIn Week 15 against the Carolina Panthers, King recovered a fumble lost by Teddy Bridgewater at the 1-yard line and made a 48-yard return during the 24–16 win.\nIn the NFC Championship Game against the Buccaneers, King struggled throughout the game, failing to making a tackle to stop a rushing touchdown, and allowing two touchdowns in the air, including one to end the first half with no time on the clock in a prevent defense, and he was involved in a controversial pass interference on Tyler Johnson on a critical third-and-four from the Tampa Bay 37-yard line with 1:46 left in the 4th quarter - this penalty sealed the game as Tampa was able to run out the clock by keeping possession with the penalty. His miscues, plus other miscues by the Packers, would haunt them as the Packers would lose 31–26.\n2021.\nOn March 26, 2021, King signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Packers. He was named the second cornerback on the depth chart to begin the season, ahead of Chandon Sullivan and rookie Eric Stokes. After a disastrous first two games, where he allowed 6 catches for 153 yards and a touchdown on 7 targets, King was benched late in the Week 2 victory against the Detroit Lions for the rookie first-round pick Stokes. Stokes played well in relief, and produced 3 pass breakups, including 2 on fourth down. King was declared inactive due to an illness ahead of the Packers' Week 3 game against the San Francisco 49ers, and also missed the Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, during which first-string cornerback Jaire Alexander was injured and placed on injured reserve (he would not play another regular season snap), presenting King with an opportunity to return to a starting role.\nKing returned to action for the Packers' Week 5 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, but left the game with a shoulder injury. In Week 6, cornerback Rasul Douglas played well as King was still nursing his shoulder injury, and was named the Packers' starting cornerback opposite Stokes. In Week 9, King returned to play against the Kansas City Chiefs with Stokes injured in pregame warmups. In Week 10, King intercepted a pass by Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson in the endzone to preserve a 17–0 shutout victory. However, starting in Week 10, King would not exceed 40% of defensive snaps played for the Packers.\n2022.\nKing elected to skip the 2022 season in order to get “healthy”, after missing 29 of a possible 80 games played in his career.\n2023.\nKing announced on May 6, 2023, that he had suffered a torn Achilles tendon while working out to get himself in shape to be in an NFL training camp.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn April 8, 2024, King signed with the Atlanta Falcons."

        "title": "2017 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2017 Kentucky Derby (in full, the Kentucky Derby Presented by Yum! Brands, due to sponsorship) was the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby, and took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017. The Kentucky Derby is a horse race held each year in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May, at the end of the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. It is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of , and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875. The race was broadcast by NBC with a scheduled post time of 6:34 PM ET. The race went off at 6:52 PM ET before a crowd of 158,070 and a television TAD of 16.5 million viewers. The winner was the post-time favorite, Always Dreaming.\nQualification.\nThe field for the Kentucky Derby was limited to twenty horses who qualified based on points earned in the Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of races that was first introduced in 2013. Girvin was the top point-earner in 2017 after winning both the Risen Star Stakes and the Louisiana Derby. Classic Empire, who was the early Derby favorite after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 2016, finished second in the qualifying series after overcoming several setbacks to win the Arkansas Derby. The other major prep race winners were Gormley (Santa Anita Derby), Irap (Blue Grass Stakes), Irish War Cry (Wood Memorial), Always Dreaming (Florida Derby) and Thunder Snow (UAE Derby). Several other contenders did not enter due to injuries or because they raced inconsistently. For example, Not This Time was an early favorite for the Derby but was injured shortly after finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was retired from racing. After an impressive win in the San Felipe Stakes, Mastery was pulled up by his jockey and was found to have a condylar fracture requiring several months to heal.\nFor the first time, a spot in the starting gate was set aside for a horse from Japan through the separate Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby. Epicharis, a grandson of 1989 Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence, qualified by winning the Hyacinth Stakes at Tokyo Racecourse on February 19. However, the connections of Epicharis declined the invitation.\nField.\nOn May 3, entries for the Derby were taken and the post position draw was streamed live by Churchill Downs. After drawing post position 14, Classic Empire was installed as the lukewarm favorite on the morning line at 4–1 by Mike Battaglia. Always Dreaming in post position 5 and McCraken in post position 15 were both given odds of 5–1.\nThe entry fee is normally $25,000, but Fast and Accurate was required to pay a supplemental entry fee of $200,000 as he was not nominated to the Triple Crown earlier in the year. The two \"also eligible\" entries were scratched when none of the qualified horses opted to withdraw before the 9 a.m. Friday deadline.\nRace description.\nWhen betting opened, the odds for morning line favorite Classic Empire drifted up to 6.80/1 while those for Always Dreaming drifted down to 4.70/1, making Always Dreaming the post time favorite. The track was labelled as \"Wet Fast (sealed)\" with some standing water due to persistent rain over the course of several days. In spite of the weather, 158,070 people attended the Derby, the seventh-highest turnout in the history of the race. The television broadcast drew 16.5 million viewers, the most since 18.5 million watched Sunday Silence win the 1989 Derby.\nThe race had a difficult start for several horses. The most striking aspect of the start was the shocking refusal of Thunder Snow to run. When the gates flew open Thunder Snow inexplicably begin to buck and writhe, refusing to proceed and immediately getting pulled up. The start for several other horses was disastrous due to a \"chain reaction\" caused by Irish War Cry who, in the 17th position, ducked to the inside at the start, pushing over number 16 Tapwrit, and as a result, the 15 horse, McCracken, bumped heavily with number 14, Classic Empire. \"Classic Empire really got clobbered\", said his trainer Mark Casse. \"The track is impossible. Our horse ran extremely well, considering.\"\nFrom post position five, Always Dreaming avoided traffic problems with a burst of early speed, then settled into second place behind long shot State of Honor. In the first turn, jockey John R. Velazquez kept the colt along the rail then moved him to the outside of State of Honor down the backstretch. The two raced together into the far turn, where State of Honor started to fade while Battle of Midway and Irish War Cry moved up to challenge for the lead. Always Dreaming quickly responded by drawing away, opening up a lead of several lengths. Lookin At Lee, who had run along the rail for most of the race, found racing room and made a late run, but never threatened Always Dreaming, who won by lengths. Battle of Midway was five lengths behind in third with Classic Empire finishing fourth.\nTrainer Todd Pletcher had entered the race with one win (Super Saver in 2010) from forty-five starters over the years. Although one of the most successful trainers in the history of the sport, Pletcher was relieved to get another Derby win with Always Dreaming. \"To me\", Pletcher said, \"I felt I really needed that second one, you know?\"\nIt was also the second Derby win for Velazquez, who had previously won in 2011 with Animal Kingdom. \"This is the best horse Todd and I have ever come to the Kentucky Derby with\", he said. \"I got a good position early and then he relaxed. When we hit the quarter pole, I asked him and he responded. He did it himself from there.\"\nIt was the first Derby win for the ownership group that included Anthony Bonomo (who owns Brooklyn Boyz Stable), his wife Mary Ellen (MeB Racing), Vincent Viola (St Elias Stable) and his wife Teresa (Teresa Viola Racing). Mary Ellen Bonomo named the horse because of her tendency to daydream. \"Everybody dreams of something, whether it's a big event or special day, the birth of their child, winning the Kentucky Derby. So I just said, 'Always Dreaming.' It just took off.\"\nThis was the fifth consecutive Derby in which the post-time favorite won. The only other time this happened was in the late 1890s.\nResult.\nTimes: mile – 0:22.70; mile – 0:46.53; mile – 1:11.12; mile – 1:37.27; final – 2:03.59.Splits for each quarter-mile: (:22.70) (:23.83) (:24.59) (:26.15) (:26.32)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayout.\nThe Kentucky Derby payout schedule\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nAfter winning the Derby, Always Dreaming never won another race. Several of the runners up went on to achieve Grade I success:"

        "text": "The Robert Morris Colonials women's basketball team is the basketball team that represents Robert Morris University in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Horizon League.\nProgram History.\nRobert Morris began its women's basketball program in 1970, and rattled off 11 straight winning seasons from 1978–79 to 1988–89. Under RMU Athletic Hall of Fame head coach Dan Swalga, the Colonials achieved their first 20-win season in 1981–82 at 20–8, won the Pennwood West tournament after a 23-5 campaign in 1983–84, and captured their first ECAC Metro (now Northeast Conference) Tournament championship in 1988. Swalga led RMU to a second NEC tournament title in 1991, but the program then fell into a 16-season championship drought.\nAfter winning just seven games over a three-season span, the Colonials hired Sal Buscaglia from Manhattan to turn around the program. RMU went 3–24 in Buscaglia's first season, but rebounded with a 20–10 record in 2004-05 - marking the third-largest single-season turnaround in NCAA history. Another 20-win season followed, then the Colonials won their third NEC tournament championship and advanced to the program's first NCAA tournament in 2006–07. RMU added a second NCAA tournament berth the next season, and earned a Postseason WNIT berth in 2009-10 after going 17–1 in league play.\nFollowing an injury-plagued 2012–13 season, RMU reached the peak again in 2013–14 with its fifth NEC tournament title and third NCAA tournament berth. Two years later, Buscaglia added another NEC tournament crown and NCAA tournament bid in his final season on the bench, before handing over the reins to his son, Charlie Buscaglia, prior to the 2016–17 season.\nCoach B, as he is respectfully called, has continued to raise the standard for the program. In his first season, the Colonials made it back-to-back NEC tournament championships and played in their fifth NCAA tournament, then followed that with a school-record 25 wins and Postseason WNIT berth in 2017–18. In 2018–19, RMU went 16–2 in league play - including a 11–0 start - winning their eighth NEC tournament and sixth NCAA tournament bid. This past season, the Colonials went 23-7 and started a program-best 14–0 in the NEC, and became the first team since Saint Francis U from 2001 to 2005 to win at least a share of four consecutive NEC regular-season crowns. RMU moved onto the NEC Tournament semifinals and were recipients of the conference's NCAA tournament berth after the cancellation of the NEC Tournament due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.\nIn the classroom, the Colonials ranked in the top five of NCAA Division I women's basketball in cumulative grade point average, finishing second in 2016-17 and fourth in 2017–18.\nOverall, RMU has captured eight NEC Tournaments, eight NEC regular-season titles, and played in nine national postseason tournaments (6 NCAA, 2 WNIT, 1 WBI).

        "text": "The North Alabama Lions women's basketball team represents University of North Alabama in Florence, Alabama, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Gulf South Conference. In 2018, they joined the ASUN Conference in all sports, including women's basketball.\nHistory.\nThe women's basketball program began at the University of North Alabama in the late 1960s as part of the physical education department, but has grown into a nationally respected program that has made four trips to the NCAA Division II national tournament since 1984. Initially competing against other schools in competition known as extra-murals, the UNA women's basketball began competing under the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) in 1975, with Susan Phillips as head coach. Phillips coached the Lions from 1975–77 and was followed for one year by Sharron Perkins.\nThen, in 1978, the Lions made their first move to regional and national prominence with the hiring of Gary Elliott as head coach. Over the next four seasons, Elliott compiled a 75–42 record that included the 1979–80 Alabama Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AAIAW) State Championship and the 1981–82 AAIAW Northern Division championship. Those years also produced the school's first women's basketball All-American in Wanda Beckham, who was a second-team AIAW selection in 1980.\nMajor change came in 1982 when women's sports were included for the first time as championships under both the Gulf South Conference and the NCAA. It was also the year that Wayne Byrd was hired to succeed Elliott as the fourth women's basketball coach in school history. Byrd directed the UNA women's program for the next 16 years, winning 232 games while leading the Lions to one Gulf South Conference championship and four NCAA Division II regionals.\nThe UNA women's basketball program received its first NCAA Division II Top 20 ranking on January 16, 1984, when the Lions debuted in the poll at No. 20. The 1983–84 Lions were ranked in the Top 20 for eight straight weeks and advanced to the championship game of the Division II South Regional. In 1993–94, Byrd led the Lions an NCAA South Regional championship and a third-place finish at the Division II Elite Eight in Fargo, N.D. The Wayne Byrd era at UNA also included three All-Americans, with LaConger Cohran and Brenda Mayes earning national awards in 1985, and Serita Gauldin becoming the school's first, first-team All-America pick in women's basketball in 1998. In 1997–98, UNA guard Becky Mauck led the NCAA Division II in both free throw percentage and three-point field goal percentage, becoming the first player in Division II women's basketball history to lead the nation in two shooting categories in the same season. Mauck also established an NCAA Division II National Record for three-point percentage in a season at 56.25.\nWith Byrd's retirement in 1998, Jeri Porter became the fifth head women's basketball coach in school history.\nJeri Porter resigned as women's head coach at the end of the 2001–02 season to take a job with Radford.\nFlora Willie led the Lady Lions to a 16–12 record in the 2002–03 season and served as the UNA coach through the 2005–06 season.\nTerry Fowler became the sixth head women's basketball coach in UNA history in 2006 and took the first step in rebuilding the winning tradition with a solid 14–14 mark in his inaugural season. UNA's Amber Rutherford led Division II in free throw percentage at 93.7, and the Lions returned to the Gulf South Conference Tournament for the first time since 2003.\nFollowing an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2013, Fowler left to become the head coach at the University of South Alabama. UNA then hired Missy Tiber, who coached for five seasons before leading the program as the school began its transition to NCAA Division I basketball in the 2018–19 season.\nThe Lions posted a 21–9 record during its first Division I season, earning a No. 4 seed in the ASUN Tournament with a 10–6 league record after being picked to finish eighth in the preseason coaches' poll. The following season, the Lions posted a 21–9 mark, giving UNA three straight 20-win seasons for the first time in program history.\nFollowing a successful debut at the Division I level, Tiber's second Division I team at UNA continued to reach new heights. Led by a senior class that won a school-record 85 games and included the top two scorers in program history, the Lions set 14 school records at the single-season and career levels.\nIn March 2024, Candi Whitaker was announced as the program's eighth head coach.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Lions made seven appearances in the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament. They had a combined record of 6–7.\nWBI results.\nThe Lions have appeared in the Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) once. Their record is 2–1."

        "title": "1797 Rugby School rebellion",
        "text": "The 1797 Rugby School Rebellion was a mutiny of the boys at Rugby School after the headmaster, Dr Henry Ingles, demanded that boys from the fifth and sixth forms should pay for the repair of a local tradesman's windows after they had been smashed by the school's pupils. The rebellion saw many of the school windows broken and its furniture burnt before the boys withdrew to an island on the school grounds. A local justice of the peace read the Riot Act, while soldiers crossed the island's moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.\nThe rebellion was only one of several that took place at Rugby. The school was not alone in seeing disruption: several other public schools also saw trouble between 1710 and 1832.\nRugby School and discipline in 18th century public schools.\nRugby School—founded in 1567—was one of the original seven public schools, along with Winchester, founded in 1382; Eton College, founded in 1440; Shrewsbury, founded in 1552; Westminster, founded in 1560; Harrow, founded in 1571; Charterhouse, founded in 1611.\nDiscipline at public schools in the 18th and 19th centuries was poor. According to the sociologists Kenneth Sheard and Eric Dunning, the reason lay in the balance of power between pupils and masters. Because the children of the upper class had previously been educated at home by tutors, these took the position of paid staff, and were therefore seen as socially inferior by their pupils. Sheard and Dunning consider that the tutors, \"confronted with pupils who were aristocrats and gentlemen, ... became hesitant and uncertain in the execution of their role\".\nAt its worst, the breakdown in discipline led pupil rebellions at several institutions. In 1710 the pupils of Winchester rebelled over their beer ration. The school further rebelled in 1770, 1774, 1788 and 1793; Eton revolted in 1728, 1768 and 1783; Harrow had their protest in 1771; and Rugby's first revolt came in 1786. Some were peaceful—the first Eton rebellion had been a walk-out by pupils with no violence—others were accompanied by threats, violence and damage to the school.\nAt the time of the rebellion, Rugby's headmaster was Dr Henry Ingles. He was appointed to the position in 1794 after having been the headmaster at Macclesfield School. A gloomy man and a strict disciplinarian, the pupils nicknamed him the Black Tiger.\nNovember 1797.\nIn November 1797 Ingles found Astley, a pupil from Gascoigne's boarding house, firing cork bullets at the study windows of Mr Gascoigne, the housemaster. Ingles asked the boy where he had purchased the gunpowder, and was informed it was from Rowell's, a local outlet that combined a grocers, booksellers and ironmongers. When Ingles confronted Rowell, the shopkeeper denied selling the powder and showed Ingles his sales book, in which the sale had been recorded as tea. Ingles took the shopkeeper's word over that of Astley, and the boy was flogged for lying. Astley told his friends about the flogging and the reason for it. Angered, Astley's friends smashed the windows of Rowell's.\nWhen Ingles heard of the vandalism, he said that all the members of the fifth and sixth forms would pay for the damage. The boys drew up a round robin response—hiding the identity of the ringleaders—in which they refused to pay. The headmaster threatened punishment as a result. That Friday, after fourth lesson, the boys placed a home-made petard—a small bomb used to blow open doors—against a school door, which was blown off its hinges.\nThe following day the school bell was rung by the boys to signal the next part of the rebellion; at the same time fags were sent to the boarding houses to rally boys to the main school building. The windows of the main building were all broken and the school's furniture—including its wainscot panelling—were thrown into the Close, the large main field in front of the school, where it was set alight. Also added to the pile were Ingles's books; Billy Plus, the school butler rescued some of the more expensive copies from the fire. The passage between School House, one of the boarding houses, and the main school building was nailed shut by the boys to stop Ingles—who lived in at the boarding house—gaining access into the school.\nAs Saturday afternoons were free of lessons, many of the masters had already left the school grounds. Ingles sent messages for them to return, but most were too far away to be found (two were fishing in the River Avon, another was out shooting rabbits). Ingles sent a message to Mr Butlin, a local banker and the town's justice of the peace. It was market day in Rugby, so Butlin asked the horse-dealers, with their long droving whips to assist. He also asked an army recruitment party, headed by a sergeant, for their assistance. An armed guard, with fixed bayonet, was placed at School House, and the remainder of the soldiers, together with the horse-dealers and special constables, approached the Close.\nThe rebellious schoolboys left the bonfire of furniture, and retreated to \"the Island\", a Bronze Age burial mound on the side of the Close, surrounded by a water moat, up to deep and wide; after crossing the ditch, the boys drew up the wooden drawbridge. While Butlin distracted the boys, by reading them the Riot Act, the soldiers circled round behind them and crossed the moat on the opposite side and took them prisoner.\nAftermath.\nIngles had locked himself into School House while the events unfolded, but he emerged at the conclusion of the event. He immediately expelled the ringleaders and had many others flogged. One of the ringleaders was subsequently identified as Willoughby Cotton who entered the army shortly afterwards and led troops in Jamaica to put down a slave rebellion in 1831; of those expelled, one later became a bishop, another a marquess.\nThe rebellion was not the last to occur in public schools, nor even at Rugby: the school was the location of further revolts by the boys in 1820 and 1822. Between 1797 and 1832 there were ten further rebellions in schools, four at Eton, three at Winchester and one each at Charterhouse, Harrow and Shrewsbury."

A few kids would turn up now and then to play football albeit it was no sports venue. But with inception of Nepal Premier League, Fapla has now grabbed a new level of popularity throughout the nation.\nBefore Fapla, every cricket tournament in Dhangadhi was played in Dhangadi Rangashala. But the Rangashala was built into a football stadium for 6th national games. So cricket in Dhangadhi was shifted to Zonal Police Ground. Zonal Police Ground is in the heart of Dhangadhi] and although was easier for the spectators to come there and watch the game but the ground, being in police territory-the permission to host tournaments did not come easy.\nIt was those times when had just won WCL-4 and with Nepal's success in ACC tournaments more people in Dhangadi got involved with cricket. Consequently, more tournaments were being hosted. And till today there is always a cricket tournament going on in Dhanghadi. Zonal Police being the only ground back then was thus mostly occupied.\nLast year Dhangadhi Cricket Academy in its very first year of establishment set eye on starting a cricket league. It faced the same problem as many cricket tournaments face in Dhanghadi-unavailability of cricket ground. Subash Shahi then put forward an idea as developing Fapla as a cricket venue and in future upgrade with facilities of international standard. Fapla was approved for the first edition of Dhangadi Cricket League.\n“The condition of this place was miserable then” Shahi remembers the dusty ground in which first edition of DCA was played. “I saw a dream of international matches being played here and invested my personal money in its construction”, he explained. Right now Fapla is not just lusty green turf but also getting concrete parfaits for spectators.\nDescription and Prospects.\nThe boundaries are mentioned 70 m long in the map but the ground being constructed for NPL has is around 60-65m boundaries.\nSelector and Cricket expert Basu Dev Joshi points out that Nepal needs more grounds to raise Nepal's cricketing standard.\n“Playing in the well equipped grounds (one with turf pitches) will help a player to sharpen his talent,” said Amit Poudel, a U16 national player who remembers playing all matches in Dhangadi in mats. When completed Fapla will be the first cricket ground with turf wickets in Dhanghadi.\nThe cost of construction of Fapla Cricket Ground is estimated at around 1 crore but when it completed will give back a lot more. It will surely give Dhanghadi better chances at National Tournament. Also with better infrastructures Nepal will rise higher in ICC's Cricket development ranking. Fapla cricket ground will likely be completed in few days. Construction of a ground is a big deal in itself but what important once the construction is completed is its maintenance-if that is ensured Fapla will surely be a faith changer for Nepal cricket.\nOrganizer of the SPA Cup, President of Dhangadhi Cricket Academy (DCA), vice-president of Dhangadhi Cricket Association, and once opener for Region No.6 Baitadi; Shahi is taken almost as a father figure by budding cricketers here. Shahi has now set an eye on developing Dhangadhi as “Cricket Capital of Nepal” and is currently investing his time on building the Fapla Cricket Ground.\nSee Also.\nMulpani International Cricket Ground\nGautam Buddha Cricket Ground\nTribhuvan University International Cricket Ground\nDang International Cricket Ground"

        "text": "Ceratizit–WNT Pro Cycling (UCI code WNT) is a professional women's cycling team, based in Kempten, Germany, which competes in elite road bicycle racing events such as the UCI Women's World Tour.\nHistory.\nThe team was founded in 2014 as an amateur club team in Sheffield / UK competing in regional and national races with the occasional UCI level race. After three years the team was transformed from an amateur team into a professional UCI team, and is invited to compete in major races all over Europe. The team itself no longer consists purely of British riders. Since 2019 the team includes women of seven different countries (Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France and Canada) giving it an even greater international flavour. 2019 saw a big expansion and inclusion of high-level riders into the team roster such as Kirsten Wild, Lisa Brennauer and Ane Santesteban. Due this expansion the team made the step-up into the top 10 of the UCI-ranking, with a ranking of 7th place. In 2020 the team signed Maria Giulia Confalonieri of Italy and Julie Leth of Denmark, both double European Champions.\n2017.\nAhead of the 2017 season, WNT made another leap in the team's progression by applying for a UCI Women's team licence, with former Scottish Cycling head coach Graeme Herd as their directeur sportif. Expanding its roster outside the UK and Ireland, gaining Austrian Anna Badegruber and Luxembourger Elise Maes from Austrian team Vitalogic Astrokalb Radunion Nö as it stepped away from its UCI Women licence in 2017.\nThe team won its first professional race in its first outing as a UCI team in March 2017, on stage 4 of Setmana Ciclista Valenciana when Irish Champion Lydia Boylan soloed to victory. The team's second UCI victory came at the Lotto Thüringen Ladies Tour on stage 3, when Hayley Simmonds attacked in the closing kilometres, taking a solo victory of over a minute, and consequently moved into the yellow jersey. Simmonds finished 3rd place on general classification behind Lisa Brennauer.\nAt the end of 2017, the team's service course moved from the UK to Reutte, Austria, the hometown of WNT's parent company, Ceratizit, although the team's address registered with the Union Cycliste Internationale was still located in Sheffield.\n2018.\n2018 saw a further internationalisation of the roster, with the additions of German Lea Lin Teutenberg and Dutchwoman Aafke Soet. Spanish bicycle component manufacturer, Rotor signed onto Team WNT as a second naming sponsor, setting the team to be the first to race full-time on hydraulic shifting and braking groupset. WNT-Rotor took on a greater Spanish influence with its switch from long time frame partner Specialized to Orbea. The team also joined as one of five UCI women's teams to transition to disc brakes in 2018, moving from its already new hydraulic Rotor rim brake groupset to debut the disc brake version at Dwars door Vlaanderen.\nShortly after the team completed Setmana Ciclista Valenciana, it was announced that Graeme Herd would leave the team immediately, with Dirk Baldinger taking up Herd's role as DS. Former rider, Canadian Gabrielle Pilote-Fortin was a late signing for 2018 at the end of March.\nHalf the team's then ten rider roster were selected to compete on the road and track at the 2018 Commonwealth Games; for Northern Ireland, Lydia Boylan, for Wales, Hayley Jones, for Scotland, Eileen Roe, and for England Melissa Lowther and Hayley Simmonds. While Melissa Lowther had been selected for both the time trial and road race, but due to an administrative error by Team England, Lowther was barred from starting the individual time trial. Hayley Simmonds earned a bronze medal in the Commonwealth Games individual time trial, behind recent ITT world championship medallist Katrin Garfoot and former time trial world champion Linda Villumsen.\nAafke Soet earned WNT Rotor's first win of the 2018 season at the start of April by winning the last stage of the Healthy Ageing Tour in solo breakaway, the victory was also her first-ever elite-level win. Soet would back up that road race win at her next race appearance, with the fastest time in the time trial event at Omloop van Borsele.\n2019.\nThe Season 2019 started very successfully for the WNT-ROTOR Pro Cycling Team. After wins at the Six Days in Bremen (Germany) on the track the new team member Clara Koppenburg won stage 3 of the Seltmana Ciclista Valenciana and took over the General Classification jersey. The team defended this jersey on stage 4 and also won the team classification. One-week later Kirsten Wild and Lisa Brennauer won in total 5 medals at the Track World Championships in Pruszków, Poland; Wild won gold in the Madison and omnium, Silver in the scratch race and Bronze in the points race, while Brennauer won a silver medal in the individual pursuit and a new German record).\nThe team won its first UCI Women's World Tour race at Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne with Kirsten Wild who won the bunch sprint after a big lead out from Lisa Brennauer. Three days later, Kirsten Wild won Gent–Wevelgem, becoming the first rider to win the Belgian spring classic twice.\nIn total the team amassed 15 victories in road racing during the 2019 season with four different riders. Kathrin Hammes won the overall classification of the Lotto Thüringen Ladies Tour after being in the breakaway on stage 1. The team helped defended the yellow, where Kathrin was able to win her home tour by 11 seconds.\nOn 28 November 2019, the team announced that the CERATIZIT Group, who are the parent company of WNT would be joining as title sponsor of the team."
