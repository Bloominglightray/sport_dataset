        "title": "Magnificent Seven (gymnastics)",
        "text": "The Magnificent Seven was the 1996 United States Olympic women's gymnastics team that won the first ever gold medal for the United States in the women's team competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The seven members of the team were Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps, and team captain Amanda Borden. Miller, Dawes and Chow also won an individual gold, silver and bronze medal respectively in Atlanta. The team is perhaps best known for Strug sticking the landing of a vault to clinch the gold medal while injured.\n1996 Olympics.\nIndividual stars.\nThe leader of the Magnificent Seven is often said to be Shannon Miller, the second most decorated American gymnast in history and that year's reigning national champion. The other two individual stars on the team were Dominique Dawes and Dominique Moceanu, the previous two national champions (in 1994 and 1995 respectively). However, Kerri Strug eventually qualified for the individual all-around over Moceanu.\nThe other three members on the team were less heralded. Nevertheless, they were an integral part of the team's success. Amy Chow had the highest difficulty of anyone on the team, most notably on the uneven bars. Jaycie Phelps provided clean lines and solid gymnastics on all four events. The final member to qualify for the team, Amanda Borden, was named team captain. \nThe highest two scoring athletes on the team during the compulsories did not even perform at the Olympic Trials. Both Miller and Moceanu had been sidelined with injuries, but were named to the team anyway, proving that the petition-system was in the team's best interest.\nTeam competition.\nCompulsories.\nThe team compulsories took place on July 21, 1996. Unlike in the 1992 Games, when two athletes from each country participated in each session, in these Games, teams competed together. The United States team competed in the third session, with Russia and China left to compete in the fourth session. Romania had already competed in the first session, so the United States team could only chase their already posted scores. The top four teams would compete in the last session during the optionals. Ultimately, Ukraine, not China, earned this fourth spot along with the United States, Russia, and Romania.\nWith seven athletes on each team for the first and only time, each team (other than Romania who had only six members because of an injury) put their six best team members up on each event. Of these six scores, only the top five would count. On the United States team in both compulsories and optionals, Miller, Moceanu, Dawes, Strug, and Phelps competed on all four events while Chow only competed on bars and vault and Borden only competed on beam and floor. The United States started their meet on uneven bars with no major misses. Miller earned the highest score of 9.775, and Strug's score of 9.675 was dropped.\nFollowing uneven bars, the team moved to balance beam where Strug led off with a shaky performance. Borden and Dawes followed, each with noticeable errors. Phelps, who won the compulsory round at the Olympic Trials (although neither Miller or Moceanu competed at this event), was next. Although known for her beautiful technique, she looked shaky from the start of the routine and fell off the beam during the fouette jump element. Although she finished strongly, her low score of 9.012 was dropped. Miller followed with a routine that appeared to be flawless and earned the overall high beam score of the competition, 9.737. Moceanu anchored the United States and with only minor errors and impeccable form on certain elements earned a 9.687.\nNext the group moved to floor exercise where everyone performed well, with no major errors. Strug earned the team's high score of 9.825, and Phelps' score of 9.662 was dropped. At this point in the competition, the United States was still trailing Romania as the team moved to vault.\nEveryone vaulted well, with Dawes, Miller, and Strug sticking their landings. Chow essentially stuck her landing as well, with only a minor slide of her left foot. The United States surpassed Romania after this rotation, but Russia would later qualify first to optionals.\nOptionals.\nAs in the compulsory round, the United States started the competition on uneven bars. Everyone performed well with Miller, Strug, and Phelps tying with the team's low score of 9.787. Dawes posted the team's high score of 9.850 and combined with their scores from compulsories, both Dawes and Chow qualified for event finals. The team then moved to balance beam.\nPutting their rocky compulsory round behind them, the team performed well on beam without any major errors. Miller posted one of the competition's high beam score of 9.862 (Kui Yuanyuan of China had the highest score of 9.875) and qualified first to the event finals, ahead of Moceanu who earned a 9.850 and qualified second. Phelps' score of 9.600 was dropped.\nAs the event took place in Atlanta, the crowd was heavily pro-United States, and the cheering and flash photography was at an unprecedented level. The crowd continued to cheer on its team as the group moved to the floor exercise where Phelps led off with a great start. Borden, Moceanu, and Dawes followed, all without significant error. As predicted, Moceanu's floor music, \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia,\" was a smash hit with the already raucous crowd. Following Dawes was Miller who showed the first obvious error in any of the American routines when she under-rotated her opening tumbling pass, a double layout. Although a major break, Miller avoided touching the floor with her hands, finished strongly, and the team ultimately dropped her score of 9.618. Strug anchored the team and earned a 9.837, qualifying first to event finals along with Moceanu who also earned a 9.837 and qualified fourth. Dawes, who posted the team's high optionals floor exercise score of 9.850, would have qualified seventh to the event finals but because of the rule that only two gymnasts from each country can compete, she was to be left out. The team was leading Russia by .897 as the group moved to vault.\nIn the team competition, each gymnast performed two vaults however, only the higher score of the two vaults was counted. Phelps led the team off, followed by Chow, Miller, and Dawes, all with strong showings. With a narrow lead, Moceanu vaulted next, needing a 9.762 to secure the gold medal. On both of Moceanu's attempts, she was severely under-rotated and fell backwards onto the mat. She earned only a 9.200 which was not enough to clinch the gold medal. Russia was still performing on floor, with 1994 floor world champion Dina Kochetkova and reigning Russian national floor champion Roza Galieva still to perform their routines. The Russian team could have won gold if their last three scores averaged over 9.816, which was well within their capabilities. Strug, Moceanu, Dominique Dawes, Romanian gymnasts Simona Amânar and Gina Gogean, and Chinese gymnast Ji Liya had all received floor scores of 9.825 or higher earlier that night from the same judging panel.\nStrug vaulted next as the anchor of the team and performed the same vault as Moceanu, also falling backwards onto the mat. Upon standing up, it became apparent that Strug had suffered an injury to her ankle. Strug was encouraged by her coach, Béla Károlyi, to vault again. Karolyi continuously chanted, \"you can do it, Kerri!\" which later became a mantra in popular culture.\nThe secondary story, often overlooked by the public, is that both Strug and Moceanu were in a tight contest with each other and with Dawes to qualify to the individual All-Around competition. Only three gymnasts per country could advance to the All-Around final, and had Strug not vaulted again, she would have finished fourth behind Miller, Dawes, and Moceanu. Exactly how this may have played a factor is unknown, but unlike the other U.S. gymnasts who opted to perform an easier vault first, Moceanu and Strug both performed their harder Yurchenko 1.5 for both attempts, despite warming up the easier Yurchenko half. Karolyi’s strategy may have been to maximize the scores of his own gymnasts for All-Around qualification, rather than secure safe vault scores for the team first. Moceanu and Strug needed vault score of 9.450 and 9.775 respectively to qualify ahead of Dawes. \nStrug walked around, trying to shake off the injury to her ankle, as she headed back to the start of the vaulting runway with Karolyi's and her teammates' encouragement. With the scores of the three best Russian floor workers yet to be posted, Strug needed to vault a second time to secure the gold medal for her team and prevent the Russians from catching up. She performed the second vault well and nearly stuck the landing, however, she immediately lifted her injured leg and collapsed in pain, needing to be carried off the podium. Strug scored a 9.712, securing the gold medal, and the crowd erupted with cheers. This image of Strug's vault instantly became the most enduring moment of the 1996 Olympics, and one of the most celebrated moments in American Olympic history. Strug not only qualified for vault finals, but also for the All-Around competition. In a twist of irony, the vault that secured her place in the All-Around also prohibited her from participating as she was too injured to compete, and Moceanu took her place. Miller took her place in vault finals, and Dawes took her place in floor finals. Additionally, Dawes qualified for vault finals during this competition, earning the team's high vault score of 9.762.\nStrug was immediately carried away to a hospital tent, however, Karolyi, adamant that she not miss the medal ceremony, eventually carried her to the podium behind the team. Miller moved out of her assigned place in line (based on height) to Strug's left side to help lift Strug onto the podium along with Moceanu who was on Strug's right. Because of being whisked away from the team and the thick bandage on her leg, Strug didn't have time to put the pants of her warm-up suit on and thus was the only one not wearing them. Because of these factors, the resulting team photographs show a less uniform look amongst the teammates than in other years.\nDespite Strug's heroic vault, Miller was the team's highest scoring member of the team competition, earning the second-highest two-day total in the entire competition (78.028, behind Lilia Podkopayeva's 78.061). However, Dawes (39.187) was the team's highest scoring member during the optionals portion of the competition (only Simona Amânar's optionals score of 39.387 was higher than that of Dawes), and Strug's optionals total (39.073) also narrowly outscored Miller's (38.967).\nThe team's gold medal victory was considered phenomenal for the United States because the then defunct Soviet Union had won the event in every Olympics it had entered since the 1950s. Furthermore, the United States had never won the event in either the Olympics or the World Championships, yet in Atlanta, they fielded the deepest American team in history up to that point and upstaged both the Russians and the reigning World Champion Romanians.\nWinning the gold medal instantly endeared the team to the American public, and tours, endorsement deals, interviews, and televised specials followed, earning them all a secure place in American Olympic and gymnastics history.\nOlympic team scores.\nFor all team scores see Gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic team all-around.\nIndividual All-Around finals.\nIn the individual All-Around finals, Dominique Moceanu had a big balance check after her punch front on the balance beam which ultimately knocked her out of contention when she only scored a 9.600. Despite the low score she still managed to finish 9th in the all-around. In stark contrast, Dominique Dawes and Shannon Miller both started out on the uneven bars, and after the first two rotations (uneven bars and balance beam) they were in 1st and 2nd place respectively. The excitement however, proved to be short lived. Miller came up short on her first tumbling pass on floor (a double layout), and stepped out of bounds on her last tumbling pass on floor (a full twisting double back). A score of 9.475 dashed any dreams of a medal for her. Next up was Dawes, and while doing a punch front on floor she fell out of bounds. She scored a 9.000 and just like that team USA was completely out of the all-around contention. Miller ended up placing 8th, while Dawes placed 17th. World champion Lilia Podkopayeva took the title and the gold, while the three Romanians took revenge for their disappointing team bronze by sweeping the other medals (Gina Gogean won silver, and Simona Amânar and Lavinia Miloşovici tied for bronze).\nEvent finals.\nVault.\nDuring event finals team USA did considerably better. On day one of event finals on vault both Shannon Miller (subbing for an injured Kerri Strug) and Dominique Dawes competed. Neither were flawless, with Miller falling on her second vault, and they finished 6th (Dawes) and 8th (Miller). Simona Amânar of Romania won with a 9.825 average, while Mo Huilan of China finished second (9.768) and Gina Gogean of Romania third (9.750).\nUneven bars.\nOn the next event, uneven bars, both Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes competed. Amy Chow had a great routine to score a 9.837 which tied Bi Weijing for second. Svetlana Khorkina finished first (9.850) and Dominique Dawes finished fourth (9.800).\nBalance beam.\nOn the balance beam event finals was where the USA crowd saw the most drama. Dominique Moceanu and Shannon Miller were both competing, and they were both supposed to challenge for gold. Moceanu, however, had a very scary fall. During her flight series of a back handspring followed by three layouts, she missed her foot on the second layout but still flipped over and smashed her head into the beam. Somehow she was able to grab onto the beam with both hands, but the damage had already been done with a score of 9.125 and 6th place. Miller, however, did well to score a 9.862 and win the beam title.\nThis was the only individual gold for the United States at the 1996 Olympics and only the third ever individual Olympic gold for U.S. women's gymnastics – the first in a non-boycotted Olympics. (Mary Lou Retton won all-around gold in 1984 and Julianne McNamara won gold on uneven bars in 1984). Since then, eight American female gymnasts have won individual Olympic gold medals: Carly Patterson (all-around in 2004), Nastia Liukin (all-around in 2008), Shawn Johnson (balance beam in 2008), Gabrielle Douglas (all-around in 2012), Aly Raisman (floor exercise in 2012), Simone Biles (all-around, vault, and floor exercise in 2016), Jade Carey (floor exercise in 2021), and Sunisa Lee (all around in 2021).\nFloor exercise.\nDuring the floor final Dominique Moceanu and Dominique Dawes both competed. They both had successful routines; however Dawes performed better for a 9.837 and 3rd place, while Moceanu received a 9.825 and 4th place. The crowd loved Moceanu's cute choreography and presentation, but her tumbling was not as difficult as the three medalists.\nPost-Olympics.\nThe Magnificent Seven went on tour after their gold medal performance. Strug, however, elected not to join the other six members and instead headlined a rival tour for considerably higher compensation than the other six.\nThe entire team appeared on a Wheaties cereal box and on several talk shows. Miller, once again the most successful member of the team following her five medal total in the Barcelona Games, captured the only individual gold for the American women. Her gold medal on the balance beam was a first for an American, followed only by Shawn Johnson at the 2008 games.\nIn 2008, Magnificent Seven was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in the team category. The team received their award in Chicago with other Olympic greats.\nIn 2012, viewers were able to vote on some of the greatest Olympic moments in NBC history for a special Top 30 Olympic Moments program to air July 21, prior to the London Olympics. Kerri Strug's vault was one of the clips and ended up receiving the most votes, placing first on the countdown.\nOn July 8–10, 2016 all of the Magnificent Seven were at the SAP center for the Olympic trials and the USA Gymnastics' Parade of Olympians on July 9 in San Jose, California."

        "text": "Zane William Smith (born December 28, 1960) is a former American professional baseball player.\nCareer.\nSmith, a left-handed pitcher, played collegiately at Indiana State University. He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 3rd round of the 1982 amateur draft and made his Major League debut on September 10, 1984, for Atlanta. His first successful season was 1987 with the Braves, when he led the team with 15 wins, nearly twice as many as any other Braves pitcher on a team with only 69 wins. He was among the league leaders in wins (tied 5th), innings pitched (5th), games started (tied 1st), complete games (4th) and shutouts (tied 3rd).\nSmith was traded from Atlanta to the Montreal Expos on July 2, 1989, for Sergio Valdez, Nate Minchey and minor leaguer Kevin Dean. Just over a year later, on August 8, 1990, Smith was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Scott Ruskin, Willie Greene and Moisés Alou. The trade allowed the Pirates to hold off the New York Mets down the stretch and win the National League Eastern Division pennant. Smith contributed by winning 6 games, 3 of them complete games, 2 of those shutouts, while losing only 2, and compiling a 1.30 ERA. It was during this season that Smith had his best performance, a 1 hit complete-game shutout of the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader sweep that gave the Pirates a 2.5 game lead over the Mets.\nSmith played with the Pirates through the 1994 season before signing as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox on April 18, 1995. Smith did not have much success during the 1995 season for Boston, compiling a 5.61 ERA and an 8–8 record in 24 starts. The next offseason, he returned to the Pirates for a salary that was significantly reduced from the $3.125 million he earned in 1994. Smith pitched his final career game for the Pirates on July 5, 1996; he would be released by the Pirates the following day.\nHighlights.\nOn May 1, 1986, Smith struck out 12 Mets to end New York's club record tying 11 game win streak.\nOn April 17, 1988, Smith got Atlanta's first victory of the season, ending a 10-game season-opening losing streak that set an MLB record.\nOn October 3, 1995, Smith gave up a walk-off home run to Tony Peña to end Game 1 of the 1995 American League Division Series.\nOn June 7, 1996, Smith recorded the 100th and final win of his career, a complete-game shutout at San Diego.\nPersonal.\nSmith has three daughters and lives near Atlanta.\nZane enjoys listening to hard-rock music."

        "title": "Sri Lanka Cricket A Team Triangular Series in 2005–06",
        "text": "The Sri Lanka Cricket A Team Triangular Series was a one-day cricket tournament held in Sri Lanka from 21 September 2005 to 1 October 2005. Three A teams participated – Sri Lanka A, South Africa A New Zealand A. These were not the national cricket teams, but rather second XIs made up of players who are not judged good enough for the national side by the national selectors. There was an initial group stage where each team played each other twice, making a total of six matches, before the one-game final determined the winner. Six of seven matches were played in Colombo, while the seventh took place in Moratuwa.\nSouth Africa A dominated the tournament, perhaps surprisingly after coming off a 0–1 defeat in the first class series against Sri Lanka A. In this tournament, however, they were dominant, and won all their five games in the tournament. The hosts Sri Lanka A were knocked out, as they had the same win–loss record as New Zealand A but fewer bonus points. South Africa A relied on the depth of their bowling attack, with seven different bowlers taking more than four wickets – Dale Steyn took the most with nine – while their captain Jacques Rudolph was the highest run-scorer with 147. However, New Zealand A had players who scored more runs (Mathew Sinclair, James Marshall and Michael Papps all exceeded Rudolph's total) and took more wickets (Chris Martin ended with 11), but the players rarely fired together.\nMatch details.\nWarm-up matches.\nThese matches were arranged to give the visiting teams match practice before the tournament started on 21 September.\nSri Lanka Under-23s v South Africa A, 19 September.\nSouth Africa A won by 174 runs\nSri Lanka Cricket XI v New Zealand A, 19 September.\nNew Zealand A won by 153 runs\nFirst Match: Sri Lanka A v South Africa A, 21 September.\nSouth Africa A won by ten wickets\nSouth African fast bowler Dale Steyn took apart the Sri Lanka A batting line-up, as Sri Lanka A subsided for 45 – only five days after they had completed a 1–0 series win in the first class matches earlier in the week. However, in this match only Jeewan Mendis managed to get into double figures, and only two partnerships got into double figures. Intriguingly, 9 runs came off wides – 20% of the Sri Lankan total. Steyn finished with five wickets for 20 runs, Tyron Henderson took two for 14, while Albie Morkel and Johannes van der Wath finished off the innings by removing the last three batsmen. Andrew Puttick and Loots Bosman spent half an hour facing 29 balls to canter to 47 without loss, with Nuwan Zoysa conceded 31 from 17 deliveries – including four no-balls and a wide.\nSecond Match: Sri Lanka A v New Zealand A, 22 September.\nSri Lanka A won by 12 runs\nThe Sri Lankan captain Gunawardene was dismissed for his second successive duck, as Daryl Tuffey and Chris Martin took early wickets and the hosts struggled to two for two. However, a 98-run stand between Jehan Mubarak and Upul Tharanga gave the initiative back to Sri Lanka, and all-rounder Dilhara Lokuhettige could increase the run rate in the final overs, hitting 57 off 39 balls. New Zealander Chris Harris went without a wicket, but only conceded 19 off ten overs, but the other bowlers leaked too many runs as Sri Lanka closed on 251 for 6 off 50 overs. New Zealand A's innings started off with a maiden over from Zoysa, followed up by Jesse Ryder being caught behind for 0. Matt Sinclair and Peter Fulton added half-centuries, and New Zealand were going along nicely at 189 for 5, but the four last wickets were lost to Jehan Mubarak – who ended with five for 59. Thus, New Zealand ran out of men to score the required runs, with their total score 239 for 9.\nThird Match: New Zealand A v South Africa A, 24 September.\nSouth Africa A won by six wickets\nFourth Match: Sri Lanka A v New Zealand A, 25 September.\nNew Zealand A won by 72 runs\nFifth Match: Sri Lanka A v South Africa A, 27 September.\nSouth Africa A won by four wickets\nSixth Match: New Zealand A v South Africa A, 28 September.\nSouth Africa A won by one wicket\nFinal, New Zealand A v South Africa A, 1 October.\nSouth Africa A won by six wickets"

        "title": "USA Swimming",
        "text": "USA Swimming is the national governing body for competitive swimming in the United States. It is charged with selecting the United States Olympic Swimming team and any other teams that officially represent the United States, as well as the overall organization and operation of the sport within the country, in accordance with the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. The national headquarters of USA Swimming is located at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nHistory.\nUSA Swimming was originally called United States Swimming (USS) upon its departure from the AAU. Thus, there are several terms used to describe the organization at different times. These terms are: USA Swimming, USA-S, United States Swimming, USS, and US Swimming. Prior to the existence of USS, the AAU, or the Amateur Athletic Union, served as the governing body for swimming and other sports across the country.\nAmateur Athletic Union.\nThe Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was the official organization responsible for the running of all amateur sports in the United States, established in 1888. The AAU was officially charged with the organization and operation of many sports in the US. During this time, swimming was one of the committees in the organization and was not an independent governing body.\nThe Amateur Sports Act of 1978 enabled the governance of sports in the US by organizations other than the AAU. This act made each sport set up its own national governing body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the United States Olympic Committee, but would not be run by the committee. Thus, \"United States Swimming\" was born. From 1978 to 1980, the official responsibilities of governing the sport were transferred from the AAU Swimming Committee to the new United States Swimming. Bill Lippman, the last head of the Swimming Committee, and Ross Wales, the first president of United States Swimming, worked together to ease the transition. This process was made more interesting because the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics and, during this time, the leadership of the sport was in flux.\nThe AAU still holds several aquatic events, but it is no longer the official governing body of the sport.\nLocation.\nWhen it was part of the AAU to 1981, USA Swimming had its headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1981, USA Swimming moved to its present-day location in Colorado Springs. At the time of the 1981 move, it had four staff members.\nIn 1997, work was completed on the official USA Swimming Headquarters, which is currently the official home of USA Swimming.\nThrough the national headquarters, the organization provides various programs and services to its members, supporters, affiliates and the interested public. This includes educational programs, fund-raising activities, general information, publications, resources, and sports medicine programs, all relating to the sport of swimming.\nOrganizational structure.\nThere are several parts and levels that make up USA Swimming. There is the national governing body (national) level, the zone (regional) level, and the local swimming committee (local/state) level.\nThe national governing body.\nThe national governing body (NGB) of United States Swimming is an extension of the United States Olympic Committee. While all of the separate swim teams, LSC's, and Zones do not officially make up the NGB, they are all members and are subject to the laws of the NGB.\nThe NGB is made up of both staff members of USA Swimming and volunteer members of the board. The office of the President is the head of the board and is responsible for the overall direction of USA Swimming. The chief executive is the head of the staff located at the national headquarters in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center. The chief executive is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization at the national level.\nThe NGB is responsible for nearly all aspects of USA Swimming, and swimming in the United States in general. Its most important responsibility is to set the rules for the sport in the United States. These rules are guided by the international governing body for aquatic sports (FINA). FINA makes the rules that are to be followed at all international level meets. USA Swimming follows accordingly to make the rules of USA Swimming match the rules of FINA; however, it does not have to. In theory, an NGB could make its rules whatever it wanted and have all national level meets and below follow those rules, but it would not have jurisdiction over international level meets held within the borders of the United States, and such a meet would have to follow FINA rules.\nThe Local Swimming Committee.\nThe Local Swimming Committee (LSC) is the local level of USA Swimming. Each LSC is a separate entity, with each being an individual member of USA Swimming, although all act on behalf of USA Swimming on the local level. LSCs are the local administrative organization responsible for the registration, support and governance of the USA Swimming member swim clubs in their designated region. Over 3100 swim clubs across the US are registered with USA Swimming through their respective LSCs.\nThe LSC gives USA Swimming sanctions to swimming meets in their area. A sanction from the LSC allows the meet to be run under USA Swimming rules. The LSC is responsible for enforcing these rules at the meet. The LSC does this by training officials for the meet. These officials are typically parents of swimmers and volunteers. The technical swimming rules for USA Swimming are the same for all LSCs as mandated by USA Swimming. This allows an official in one LSC to officiate in another LSC without having to learn a new set of rules. This is able to be done because while each LSC may have its own set of rules they are not different regarding the actual strokes.\nAn LSC is typically responsible for an entire state; however, several bigger states (e.g. California, Texas, Pennsylvania, among others) have multiple LSCs within their boundaries. The size of the LSCs is supposed to be roughly the same and allow for easier travel between meets. The result is that while borders tend to follow state borders, this is not a rule. There are currently 59 LSCs in the country.\nMeets.\nThere are several different types and levels of meets, all but the very top level directed by individual clubs and the Local Swimming Committee. The following is a list of the types of meets, listed from lowest and most common level to highest and least common level.\nDual Meet, Double Dual, Triangular, Quadrangular, etc..\nA dual meet is a meet where each individual event is ranked based on how individual swimmers on a team swim. It is generally limited to 2 teams, but different variations can have more. In a dual meet, there is almost always a limit to the number of events that a certain person can swim, usually four, and to the number of swimmers that a certain team can enter. meet entries close up when the maximum number of people have entered. Generally, there is only 1 heat in each event and each team alternates lanes so that each team swims in half the pool, regardless of how fast each swimmer is. While this style of meet is generally uncommon for individual USA Swimming clubs, it is by far the most common of high school (NFHS) swimming, YMCA swimming, college (NCAA) swimming, and summer league swimming. Meets of this variety are almost always a low level meet because entry time standards are almost never applied to enter the meet. It can, however, be rather high level when both teams involved are very fast and have exclusively high level swimmers, as is the case with college swimming.\nInvitational Meet.\nAn invitational meet is a meet with many more teams and swimmers than a dual meet. The term \"Invitational\" comes from the fact that for a team to attend this type of meet, a team had to be invited to attend from the host team, but now is a general catch-all term for this style of meet (although there are still occasional invitation-only meets.) Meets of this variety generally have hundreds of swimmers, many teams, and many different events. Within the definition of an invitational meet, there are dozens of different styles of scoring and placing but the standard method is described here. All levels of swimming use invitational style meets at least once during their season (usually as a championship meet of all the clubs in a league), but the clubs of USA Swimming use this meet almost exclusively since there are very few leagues in USA Swimming and it acts as one giant league itself. Most meets of this style have no limits as to the number of swimmers that a team can enter, and only limit the number of times a swimmer can swim in order to make the flow of the meet manageable. Meets of this style can be at any level of swimming since all of the higher level meets use this style of meet with just more restrictive rules applied. Meets of this style usually do not have entry time standards, but can have them to either reduce the size of the meet, or raise the competition level.\nLSC Championships.\nEach Local Swimming Committee (LSC) is mandated to have a season ending championships twice a year for both Age Group (younger) and Senior (no age requirement) swimmers. Most LSC's split these up into two separate meets. The meet style is an invitational meet open only to club teams within the LSC. Almost universally, entry time standards are applied so that only the top level swimmer of the LSC can attend; only a few of the smaller LSCs do not have a time standard. Each LSC sets their own time standards (due to LSC size differences), so the competition level of the meet is not exactly the same across the country. Normally, this style meet is a prelim/final format. Common age groups are 10 and under, 11-12, 13-14, 15 and over, also known as seniors.\nZone/Sectional Championship.\nAs stated before, there are four zones and 59 LSCs in the country. While the LSC championship is a high level meet, the Zone/Sectional Championships are even higher. These meets are also of the invitational format, but the entry time standards are even higher so that only the fastest swimmers of Zones qualify. Zone and Sectional meets are of the same competition level, but serve different purposes. Zone meets are for age group swimmers and Sectional meets are for Senior swimmers. While the intention is to have one champion for the whole Zone, this is generally not possible because to have a meet of that high of a competition level, there would be very little difference between this level and the next level, so the entry times can only be made so fast. Thus, there are sometimes too many swimmers qualifying for this meet to have only a single meet in a Zone. Currently, the Central States Zone is the only one that has more than one Zone Championship meet (Age Group swimmers), and all four zones have multiple Sectional Championships (Senior swimmers). After Zone meets for age group swimmers some may qualify for Junior Nationals.\nPro Swim Series.\nThe Pro Swim Series (PSS), formally known as the Speedo Grand Prix, is a series of 7 meets held throughout the season. Held in either Short Course Yards (SCY) or long Course Meters (LCM). Swimmers race in both Olympic and non-Olympic distances, but only receive points for Olympic distances. First place receives 5 points and $1,000. Second place receives 3 points and $600. Third place receives 1 point and $200. The swimmer that accumulates the most points by the end of the series, wins a $10,000 bonus. Any swimmer of any nationality can compete in the PSS but are not eligible to some of the prizes. In 2017 the title sponsor of the PSS, Arena, did not want to be the title rights holder anymore, so TYR took over as title sponsor starting in 2018.\nNational Championship/US Open.\nThere is only 1 National Championship meet at the conclusion of each season across the country. The National Championships are also of the invitational meet format and offer extremely high level competition. Only a very small percentage of people who ever swim will make it to this high a level of competition. This meet is generally used to determine the US National Team for various international level meets each year, but is not used to determine the US Olympic Team. Currently, there are 2 National Championships each year, but the Spring Championships have traditionally been of a significantly lower level of competition than the Summer Championships. This is because the Spring Championships are so close to NCAA Championships and the fact that Spring Championships are rarely used as a selection meet for national teams.\nIn many other sports, the National Championship of the sport is known as the \"US Open\" and while swimming did have a very high national level meet by that name each year, it was just a high level meet and not a national championship meet. This specific meet was ended in 2006 and was replaced with a reformulated Spring/Winter National Championship. Since there is no \"US Open\" meet of the old format, the National Championships (specifically Summer '08) have begun to be called the \"US Open\" to bring it in line with the nomenclature of other sports\nUS Olympic Trials.\nThe Olympic Trials are held once every 4 years. Since this meet offers such a coveted prize (a spot on the US Olympic Team) it never fails to attract the absolute fastest in the sport of swimming in the United States. Because of this, the entry time standards are even faster than the National Championships. However, even though this is a faster meet and would actually offer a truer indication of who is the fastest swimmer in the United States, the winner of each event in this meet is not officially considered a National Champion and this meet is NOT held in place of the National Championships every 4 years (although the Nationals are generally not held when the Olympic Trials occur, or other selection trials). However, for 2008, the winners of the Olympic Trials were indeed officially be a National Champion with the trials meet taking the place of the National Championship meet for 2008. It is unclear if this will continue for future trials. Unlike all other US Swimming meets, United States citizenship is required to compete at this meet since only United States citizens are allowed to represent the United States at the Olympics. The Olympic Trials are also under unique requirements made by the USOC.\nOlympic Team members determined at the US Olympic Trials attend training camps at various locations across the United States, such as the 2016 US Olympic Training Camp at Northside Swim Center in San Antonio, Texas.\nIn 2021, USA Swimming debuted a two wave structure for the 2020 US Olympic Trials in response to social distancing requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was broken into two meets, called Wave I and Wave II, which were held at different dates at the same venue in June 2021. Selected qualifiers from Wave I advanced to Wave II. The 2020 US Olympic swim team was selected from Wave II participants.\nInternational Team Trials (non-Olympics).\nTrials meets are also held for the World Championships, Pan American Games and World University Games, typically at a national championship meet. The 2022 International Team Trials is one such meet, from which teams for the 2022 World Aquatics Championships and the 2022 Junior Pan Pacific Swimming Championships were selected, that is to be held as a stand-alone meet, separate from the year's National Championships.\nNational age group records.\nUSA Swimming maintains a list of current records for American swimmers ages 18 years old and younger called National Age Group (NAG) records. The records are the fastest swims by an American swimmer for the specified age group, gender, and event. NAG records are maintained for short course yards and long course meters. For both distances the age group breakdown for individual events is the same for boys and girls: 10 &amp; under, 11–12, 13–14, 15–16, and 17–18 year olds. NAG records for relays cover one age group, 15–18 year olds, and include girls, boys, and mixed relay records.\nOnline resources.\nYouTube channel.\nUSA Swimming started a YouTube channel on September 21, 2009 where it publishes a variety of swimming-centric videos covering topics such as races, athlete reactions, and training pointers. Occasionally it features athletes providing a glimpse into their daily training and nutrition routines, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also produces a series entitled \"Off the Blocks\", which features various high-profile swimmers and coaches opening up about different aspects of their training and racing.\nAwards.\nGolden Goggle Awards.\nEach year USA Swimming honors United States swimmers and coaches and their accomplishments for the year through a handful of awards called the Golden Goggle Awards, colloquially known as the Golden Goggles, which span categories such as male or female swimmer of the year, coach of the year, and relay performance of the year. USA Swimming commenced holding an annual awards ceremony to give the recipients their awards in November 2004 in New York City. The Golden Goggle Awards have received recognition on the international level, by organizations such as Reuters, FINA, and the International Olympic Committee (via \"Olympics.com\"), at the national level, including by NBC Sports and \"Sports Illustrated\", and at the local level in print newspapers such as \"The Seattle Times\" and \"Kitsap Sun\".\nPettigrew and Athlete of the Year awards.\nIn addition to the Golden Goggle Awards, USA Swimming awards an annual Pettigrew Award, an award made in honor of Kenneth J. Pettigrew and awarded to various positions including officials and referees, and an annual Athlete of the Year award, an award \"given to the individual with the most outstanding year of swimming performances\", which were both handed out at the annual business meeting starting in 2021. Prior to 2021, the awards were handed out at various organizational events including the United States Aquatic Sports Convention.\nCoach of the Year award.\nThe coach of the year award began in 1996 with its first winner being Murray Stephens from North Baltimore swimming. There are also awards for the developmental coach of the year and the ASCA (American Swim Coach Association) award. Eddie Reese of the University of Texas at Austin currently holds the most coach of the year awards at 19. The Coach of the year award is an award given out based on nominations from the community.\nControversy.\nAs with several other U.S. sports governing bodies, USA Swimming dealt with accusations of sexual abuse, resulting in several lawsuits and prompting changes in U.S. federal law.\nSeveral high-profile coaches were banned for life a couple of decades after their alleged abuses took place. In 2012, USA Swimming banned Rick Curl, and the Curl-Burke Swim Club was rebranded the Nation's Capital Swim Club, which at the time served 2,000 swimmers in the D.C. metro area. In 2013, former Olympic team coach Mitch Ivey was banned as the result of allegations dating back to the 1970s.\nIn 2018, an investigation by the Orange County Register found hundreds of swimmers whose claims of sexual abuse had allegedly been mishandled or ignored by USA Swimming. In 2020, six swimmers sued USA Swimming, accusing former executive director Chuck Wielgus and other officials at the national, state and club level of failing to address behavior by Ivey, former U.S. national team director Everett Uchiyama and former coach Andy King, the latter of whom was serving 40 years in prison after pleading no contest to 20 child molestation charges.\nAmerican activists also blocked Wielgus from being inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2014. Wielgus died in 2017."

        "text": "The 2005 Italian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Gran Premio Vodafone d'Italia 2005) was a Formula One motor race held on 4 September 2005 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Italy. It was the fifteenth race of the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship.\nThe 53-lap race was won from pole position by Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, his second victory with the team and penultimate in Formula One, with Renault drivers Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella second and third respectively. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth, thus losing ground to Alonso at the top of the Drivers' Championship. Antônio Pizzonia scored his last world championship points at this race.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2004 Constructors' Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\nReport.\nBackground.\nFernando Alonso led the drivers' championship with 24 points ahead of Kimi Räikkönen and 40 points ahead of Michael Schumacher. In the constructors' championship, Renault led McLaren-Mercedes by nine points and Ferrari by 44 points.\nPractice.\nWilliams' Nick Heidfeld, suffering from headaches following an accident which occurred during the tests held on the circuit the previous week, replaced by Antônio Pizzonia starting from the first free practice on saturday.\nQualifying.\nKimi Räikkönen set the fastest time in qualifying in his McLaren-Mercedes, but received a 10-place grid penalty for changing his engine, demoting him to 11th on the grid and giving pole to teammate Juan Pablo Montoya.\nRace.\nMontoya led every lap, winning by 2.5 seconds from the Renault of Fernando Alonso, with Giancarlo Fisichella third in the other Renault. Räikkönen climbed through the field to finish fourth, ahead of Jarno Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Antônio Pizzonia and Jenson Button. Räikkönen would have had a chance of winning with a one-stop strategy, but a deflated tyre forced him to make a second pit stop. Rubens Barrichello also had the same problem later in the day, and Montoya was lucky to finish in the lead, as his left rear tyre began to cut with several laps remaining.\nAlonso extended his lead over Räikkönen in the Drivers' Championship to 27 points, 103 to 76, with Michael Schumacher third on 55 and Montoya fourth on 50. Mathematically, the championship was now a two-horse race between Alonso and Räikkönen. Renault retained an eight-point lead over McLaren-Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship, 144 to 136, Ferrari remaining in third on 86 and Toyota fourth on 78.\nThere were no retirements during the race, a feat that had not been achieved in Formula One with a full field since the 1961 Dutch Grand Prix, and would not be achieved again until the 2011 European Grand Prix. The 2005 United States Grand Prix is also considered to have had no retirements; however, only six cars started due to problems with the supply of Michelin tyres, which led to the mass withdrawal of all teams running on those tyres due to safety issues."

        "text": "The Cyprus men's national basketball team () represents Cyprus in international basketball, and is controlled by the Cyprus Basketball Federation. The national team is coached by Christophoros Livadiotis.\nCyprus joined FIBA in 1974, where the team has mostly competed in smaller competitions such as the Games of the Small States of Europe, winning it nine times. However, Cyprus will make their debut at the top continental competition, EuroBasket, as co-hosts in 2025.\nHistory.\nCyprus made its first appearance on the international scene in qualification for EuroBasket 1983. Although the national team would come up short in their attempt, with an (0–4) record. Furthermore, Cyprus has taken part at lower level tournaments, where they have been impressive. Cyprus has won two bronze medals, and two silver medals at the European Championship for Small Countries, while also taking home one bronze, two silver, and nine gold medals at the Games of the Small States of Europe.\nDuring the first few decades on the international level for Cyprus, the national team went through multiple futile qualifying cycles which saw the team unable to successfully qualify for the EuroBasket. For qualification to EuroBasket 2017, Cyprus was placed into Group A during the qualifiers; although the team would once again be rebuffed at reaching the continental stage. Cyprus would ultimately finish up with a (2–4) record, with their only two victories coming against Switzerland.\nCyrus took part in qualifying for EuroBasket 2022, and was drawn into Group C for the first round of pre-qualifiers. The first test for the national team was against Portugal, at home in Nicosia. Cyprus would eventually prevail, in a tough match 69–67. Looking to stay perfect, the team played their next match on the road at Luxembourg. Immediately, Cyprus would run out to a big first quarter lead, and never looked back, winning 53–67. Cyprus dropped their final two matches of group play, to finish with a (2–2) record to advance.\nDuring the second round of pre-qualifiers, Cyprus was placed into Group D, with Austria, and Great Britain. However, the national team failed to win a match, and finished with an (0–4) record. Cyprus blew an opportunity to advance to the final stage of qualifiers, but would have one more chance to make amends in the third round.\nHeading into the final window of pre-qualifiers, Cyprus needed to finish top of Group F, if they were to achieve their goal. Unfortunately, the team would duplicate the results attained in the second round, with an (0–4) record once again. Cyprus ended the pre-qualifying process at a record of (2–10) overall, eliminating their opportunity to advance. After failing to qualify for EuroBasket 2022, Cyprus went through European Pre-Qualifiers for the 2023 FIBA World Cup. However, they finished (1–5) during the first round to be eliminated.\nIn March 2022, Cyprus qualified for the EuroBasket for the first time in their history, by being awarded as one of the co-hosts for the group stage at EuroBasket 2025. Matches will be played at the Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center in Limassol.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2023 against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia."

The team is controlled by the Icelandic Basketball Association.\nIceland has qualified for the EuroBasket twice, with the national team making their first ever appearance in 2015. They also participate at smaller European tournaments, such as the Games of the Small States of Europe. Although Iceland has yet to make their debut entrance on to the global stage at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 2015.\nOn 28 August 2014, Iceland qualified for the EuroBasket 2015, entering the finals of the top European competition for the first time in its history. The national team though didn't fare too well in their maiden voyage at the EuroBasket. Finishing (0-5) in their Group B pool, played in Berlin with defeats at the hands of Germany, Italy, Serbia, Spain, and Turkey. Overall it was a memorable moment for Iceland, where they finally achieved the feat of competing at a major international tournament, after numerous failed qualifications in the past.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nOn 17 September 2016, Iceland repeated their success and qualified to the continental tournament once again. The national team finished its qualification group as the runners-up behind Belgium, and above Cyprus and Switzerland, with four wins and two losses.\nAs in the previous edition though, Iceland finished their participation with five loses in five matches played in their Group A pool in Helsinki.\nEuroBasket 2022 qualification.\nAfter failing to qualify for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Iceland turned the page toward EuroBasket 2021. To attempt to qualify for three consecutive EuroBasket appearances, Iceland was placed into Group C to begin their pre-qualifying campaign, which began with two straight loses to Portugal, and Belgium. Although the national team would pick up their first win in their third game, a rematch with Portugal at home in Reykjavík. In their final match of group play the team fell to Belgium, and would have to survive the final window of pre-qualifiers if they were to advance.\nFor the final phase of pre-qualifiers, Iceland was placed into Group H, alongside Portugal once again, and Switzerland. The national team opened up group play with a tough loss on the road against Portugal 80–79. Looking to even their record at (1-1), Iceland was at home against Switzerland. The match stayed close throughout until Martin Hermannsson's heroics showed up late in the fourth quarter for Iceland; where his jumpshot in the final seconds gave the home side an momentous 83–82 victory. Heading into their next match the national team looked to capitalize on their last win. They did so in thorough fashion, dismantling Portugal 96–68 to set up one last show down with the Swiss.\nHeading into the final match day with a place in the qualifiers on the line, Iceland needed to defeat Switzerland on the road in an hostile environment. The specifics for Iceland was clear, either win to clinch a spot, or avoid losing by 18 or more points. Unfortunately, the unthinkable happened. As the national team not only lost to Switzerland, but failed to cover the point difference needed to advance.

He grew up in the United States, in the predominantly Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights, in New York City, and attended Norman Thomas High School. Flores is a member of the senior Dominican Republic national basketball team. He was the 2009 top scorer in the Israel Basketball Premier League.\nHigh school.\nFlores attended Norman Thomas High School, in New York City, where he played high school basketball.\nCollege career.\nFlores played his freshman college basketball season with Rutgers University, but he really showed all his potential during his three years with Manhattan College. He finished his career as Manhattan's all-time leading scorer, averaging 22.7 points per game. He was named All-Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year and Tournament Most Valuable Player, both in his junior and senior season. He also was selected to the All-Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference First Team, during his three seasons in Manhattan, and was the 2003 and 2004 recipient of the Haggerty Award, being named the top player in the NYC area - only the eighth player to win the award multiple times, in the 70+ year history of the honor.\nProfessional career.\nFlores was drafted by the Houston Rockets, in the 2nd round (55th pick) of the 2004 NBA draft. His draft rights were traded to the Dallas Mavericks, along with $300,000 cash, in exchange for the draft rights to Vassilis Spanoulis, before being traded to the Golden State Warriors, on August 24, 2004.

At the time of his retirement in 1934, he ranked tenth in AL history in hits (2,328) and doubles (431), seventh in games played (2,129), eighth in triples (158) and at bats (7,786), and ninth in walks (958).\nCareer.\nJudge, who batted and threw left-handed, was born in Brooklyn, New York to parents from Ireland and grew up on New York's Upper East Side near 66th Street and 1st Avenue on what is now the site of Rockefeller University. He was noticed as a 12-year-old shortstop by a local postman, Bud Hannah, who bought him a first baseman's glove so that he could play at a more natural position.\nAfter playing semipro ball in the New York area and having a tryout with the New York Giants in 1911, he signed with the Boston Red Sox in 1914. He hit over .300 as a minor leaguer before his contract was sold to the Senators in , and broke into the major leagues with 12 games late that season. Right fielder Sam Rice, who would be his teammate for the next 18 years, made his debut a month earlier.\nIn the early years of his career, Judge was slowed by the dead ball, and by playing his home games in Griffith Stadium, which defied power hitting. In 12 of his 18 seasons with the Senators, fewer home runs were hit there than in any other AL park. Judge hit 2 home runs in , but that was half of the entire team's total of 4 (three of which were hit in road games; also, opponents hit only 3 HRs while visiting Washington); the only major league team since 1900 to have fewer home runs were the Chicago White Sox, who had 3. Judge ended 1917 with the seventh highest slugging average in the AL at .417, despite having only 2 homers and 15 doubles; however, he also added 15 triples, one of three times he would hit that many. In 1918, he had one of the Senators' five total home runs. In he set a club record with 81 walks, topping the total of 74 shared by Clyde Milan and Doc Gessler; Joe Cronin broke his record with 95 in .\nOn July 1, , Judge preserved the only no-hitter of Walter Johnson's career by snaring Harry Hooper's line drive down the first base line, tossing the ball to Johnson for the final out of the 1-0 victory over the Red Sox. He ended the season with a career-high .333 batting average, and would hit over .300 every year through 1930 except 1922 and 1926. In he tied Ed Delahanty's club record of 10 home runs; Goose Goslin broke the record with 12 in .\nJudge also passed Howard Shanks to take over the team's career home run record with 27; Goslin moved ahead of him in . In addition, Judge collected 15 triples again along with 32 doubles, and finished eighth in the MVP voting. His 131 double plays that year broke Earl Sheely's AL record of 121 and came within one of George Kelly's major league mark, both set in ; Joe Hauser tied the AL record in 1924 before Sheely broke it again with 136 in 1925.\nThe Senators had traditionally struggled, finishing higher than fourth place only four times in their first two decades, but now entered the strongest period in their history. Second baseman Bucky Harris had joined the starting lineup in 1920, and shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh had been acquired in 1922, with rookie third baseman Ossie Bluege also arriving briefly the same year. In 1922 Washington set a major league team record of 161 double plays, breaking the mark of 155 shared by the 1921 Giants and White Sox, and in – the first full season in which all four played together – the Senators shattered their own mark with 182; the record would be broken by the Cincinnati Reds, with 194. In 1923 the Senators also became only the fifth team in major league history – and the first since the Philadelphia Athletics with their \"$100,000 infield\" – to have all four infielders lead the league in double plays. Judge led the AL in fielding for the first time that year with a .993 average.\nIn 1924 the Senators won their first pennant, edging the three-time defending league champion New York Yankees by two games. Batting fifth in the World Series against the Giants, Judge scored on Peckinpaugh's double with one out in the ninth inning of Game 2 for a 4-3 victory; he also completed three double plays in the game, one of which ended an inning with the bases loaded. He got three hits each in the losses in Games 3 and 5; Washington took the Series in seven games, winning 4-3 in 12 innings in the last game. They repeated as league champions in 1925, with Judge again pacing the AL with a .993 fielding average, and met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. Batting cleanup, Judge hit a home run in the second inning of Game 2 at Forbes Field for a 1-0 lead, though Pittsburgh won 3-2. In Game 3 he doubled to drive in the tying run in the third inning, and had a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the seventh to again tie the game 3-3; Washington went on to win 4-3. In Game 7 he drew a bases-loaded walk and later scored in a 4-run first inning, but Pittsburgh came back to win 9-7 and take the championship.\nDespite his small frame for a first baseman – 5 feet 8½ inches and 155 pounds – Judge led the AL in fielding average five times, an AL record for first basemen until Don Mattingly did so six times between 1984 and 1993. (Some sources credit Judge with leading the AL six times, but they count 1924 as a tie when he actually lost the title to Wally Pipp by a fraction of a point.) He led the AL in (.996), 1929 (.996) and (.998), committing only two errors in the latter season. In 1926 he broke Clyde Milan's team record of 105 career triples, though Sam Rice passed him the next year. In 1927, Judge also tied Milan's team record of 685 career walks. His career .993 fielding average set an AL mark that stood for more than three decades. In Judge collected a career-best 93 runs batted in and finished third in the MVP balloting. That year he passed George Burns to take over the league record for career games at first base, and he broke Burns' AL mark of 16,892 career putouts in 1929 and his record of 18,231 total chances in 1930. Judge broke George Sisler's AL record of 1134 career double plays in 1928, and his mark of 1251 career assists in . In 1930 he enjoyed his last strong season, again reaching double figures in doubles (29), triples (11) and home runs (10). By the time he left the Senators after the 1932 season he was among the AL's top ten players in career runs and total bases, though he was edged out of the top ten by the time he retired.\nJudge was disappointed over not being named manager of the Senators in , being passed over in favor of 26-year-old shortstop Cronin, who led the team to the pennant in his first year. Although Judge had no hard feelings about the decision, respecting owner Clark Griffith's hunch and remembering that 27-year-old Harris had managed the Senators to the 1924 championship in his first year, he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1933 season. After hitting .214 in 42 games in his first National League experience, he switched to the Red Sox in midseason and batted .296 in 35 games for them. He finished his career with 10 games for the Red Sox in early , batting .333, and then briefly managed the minor league Baltimore Orioles for several weeks.\nIn a 20-season career, Judge hit .298 with 1034 RBI in 2171 games; he also collected 2,352 hits and 213 stolen bases with a .378 on-base percentage. He ranked second to Sam Rice in Washington history in games (2084), at bats (7663), hits (2291), runs (1154), RBI (1004), doubles (421), triples (157) and total bases (3239). His 71 career home runs, all with Washington, were second in club history to Goslin's 125. His 249 sacrifice hits for the team remain the record for the Senators/Minnesota Twins franchise. His 2084 career games at first base then trailed only Jake Beckley (2377) and Charlie Grimm (2094) in major league history, and his 1543 double plays trailed only Grimm's 1733. Lou Gehrig broke his AL records for career games, putouts, total chances and double plays at first base in ; Mickey Vernon broke his league record for career assists in . Eddie Yost broke his franchise record of 943 career walks in 1955 as well.\nPost-playing career, personal life and death.\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Judge coached the Georgetown University baseball team between 1936 and 1958, except for two seasons as a Senators coach in -46 under manager Ossie Bluege. With his 1946 service, Judge barely qualified for the newly established pension system; his initial $250 investment qualified him for a $510 monthly pension after he turned 63. He was offered the Senators' managing job after the 1947 season, but he declined due to his desire to not travel heavily.\nJudge's son Joseph Judge became a writer and editor, most notably at \"National Geographic\". His grandson, Mark Judge, is a non-fiction author and conservative essayist. Mark wrote a book about his grandfather entitled \"Damn Senators\" in 2004.\nJudge died at 68 after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow outside his home in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and was buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland."

        "title": "Matt King (rugby league)",
        "text": "Matt King (born 22 August 1980) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative or , he played in the Super League for English club the Warrington Wolves and in the National Rugby League (NRL) for the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Melbourne Storm. During his time in England he won the 2009 and 2010 Challenge Cups with Warrington Wolves and was also named at in the 2010 Super League Dream Team.\nBackground and early life.\nMatthew King was born in Casino, New South Wales, Australia on 22 August 1980.\nKing began playing rugby league at the age of seven for his local club side the Casino RSM Cougars in northern New South Wales. When he was eleven he moved to Wauchope where he played Junior League for the Wauchope Blues in the under-11 and under-12 teams before moving back to Casino. He attended St Mary's Primary School and then went on to attend St Mary's High School (St Mary's Catholic College) until Year 10. When back in Casino, King joined the Lismore Marist Brothers Rams who went on to win the Group 1 A-Grade Premiership. In 2000, he was signed by the North Sydney Bears where he worked his way through the grades at the club playing in both Jersey Flegg and reserve grade. King suffered a serious shoulder injury in 2002 while playing off the bench for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks' reserve grade side and then quit rugby league because of a claimed disinterest.\nAfter hanging up his boots at the age of 22, King took up several odd jobs such as working as a bar man and a garbage collector before deciding to give rugby league another go in 2003. He then signed with the Melbourne Storm's feeder club, Brisbane Norths on the insistence of former North Sydney teammate Matt Orford who was now at the Storm. Ray Warren began to refer to him as \"Ropehead\", after his return to the NRL with dreadlocked hair.\nProfessional playing career.\nMelbourne.\nAfter moving to the Storm's feeder club in Brisbane, King played for nearly a year before being selected to make his début in the National Rugby League at the age of 23 against the St George Illawarra Dragons at WIN Stadium in round 24 of the 2003 season, impressing on his début without scoring. King went on to make another two appearances for the club in the regular season that year, scoring his first try in round 26 against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nThe 2004 NRL season saw King develop further as a player at the Storm, he cemented his place in the squad and was vital in the Melbourne side's attack, becoming a potent offensive weapon with his agility, pace, strength and ability to find the try line. At the conclusion of the 2004 club season, King finished with a total of fifteen tries and had developed into one of the up-and-coming centres in rugby league. This was recognised with his selection in the annual City vs Country match for the Country side. He was also named as the Storm's rookie of the year.\n2005 became the season where King would stamp his mark on rugby league, beginning the season by scoring seven tries in the first seven games of the season including a set of doubles against Brisbane and Canberra and again impressing City vs Country selectors enough to be again selected in the annual clash. After further impressive performances King was called up for his first major representative honour, being selected for the New South Wales State of Origin side for all three games in 2005. In the decider he became the 9th player (and 4th New south Welshman) to score a hat-trick in state of Origin.\nKing finished the 2005 season at Melbourne with fourteen tries, and coupled with his three for New South Wales, earned a spot in the Australian international side for the 2005 tour of Great Britain. He played in every game on tour and was again selected out of position on the wing, yet played well enough to earn praise from the Great Britain and Ireland international winger Brian Carney who stated King was \"the best winger in the world\".\nThe following year in 2006 started off slowly for King, but as the year progressed he worked his way into form again. He was once again selected in the New South Wales side again for the annual State of Origin series, which NSW lost 2–1 to Queensland. After his side's 15–8 loss to the Brisbane Broncos in the 2006 NRL grand final, in which he scored a try, he cost his club $5,000 after publicly criticising match referee Paul Simpkins.\nKing was selected to play for the Australian national team on the wing in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30–6 victory. After being consistently linked with a move to the Super League during the early half of 2007, Matt King finally announced on 10 July 2007, that he had signed a four-year deal with the Warrington Wolves. The deal was worth approximately A$600,000 a year, making King one of the highest paid players in rugby league.\nIn September 2007, he finally realised his dream of playing in a premiership. Melbourne won convincingly over Manly-Warringah, 34–8, and King scored an inspiring try in his last game in the NRL. Overcome with emotions, King admitted when interviewed that he had been crying shortly after the victory and that this was \"the best feeling ever\". Melbourne was subsequently stripped of this premiership due to major and deliberate salary cap breaches.\nWarrington Wolves.\nKing started playing in England with the Warrington Wolves for 2008's Super League XIII. In the semi-final of the 2009 Challenge Cup against Wigan Warriors, King scored a hat-trick of tries to help Warrington Wolves book a place in the Wembley final for the first time in nearly 20 years. He played in the Challenge cup when the Wolves defeated the Giants on 29 August, 25–16 ironically the same day his previous club, Storm, played their last game at Olympic Park Stadium.\nOn 28 November 2008, King married his longtime girlfriend Kirsten Deane in Richmond who he had met while living and playing in Melbourne. His bridal party included former teammates Ian Donnelly, Dallas Johnson and Cooper Cronk, while guests included Craig Bellamy, Billy Slater and Matt Geyer.\nHe played in the 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\nKing was selected for the Exiles squad for the Rugby League International Origin Match against England at Headingley on 10 \nJune 2011.\nOn 29 June 2011 King announced that he would leave the Warrington Wolves at the end of 2011's Super League XVI to join up with departing Wigan Warriors coach, Michael Maguire at Russell Crowe's NRL team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\nSouth Sydney.\nKing joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs from 2012 onwards on a three-year contract at the NRL club, joining former Melbourne teammates Greg Inglis and Michael Crocker who had both been playing for the Redfern club for a few seasons. It was announced that he would captain the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the 2012 NRL season along with Michael Crocker, John Sutton, Roy Asotasi and Sam Burgess.\nAn arm injury kept King out of most of the 2013 South Sydney Rabbitohs season. King played 8 games for Souths feeder club side the North Sydney Bears in the 2013 NSW Cup scoring 5 tries. Unable to regain the form he had at Melbourne, he retired at the end of the season.\nIn 2015, King returned to the South Sydney Rabbitohs side for the Auckland Nines Competition scoring four tries, including the grand final winning try against Cronulla-Sutherland in extra time.\nCoaching career.\nKing joined the coaching staff of the South Sydney Rabbitohs following his retirement at the end of the 2013 regular NRL season, contributing to the club winning the 2014 NRL premiership. Following a South Sydney coaching restructure at the end of the 2016 season, King accepted an offer to join the Sydney Roosters coaching staff.\nQuotes.\n\"For a winger to have the impact he did in a game was incredible, his input to the team's performance was significant, especially in the second game. He had such an important bearing on the result. I knew he was a good player but I didn't know he was that good.\" (New South Wales coach Ricky Stuart, commenting on King's performances after the 2005 State of Origin)\n\"I haven't had the rise of a normal first-grader so I really appreciate where I am at the moment and it's something I don't take for granted.\""

        "text": "Frank White Jr. (born September 4, 1950) is an American politician and former professional baseball player, coach, and television sports commentator who is currently the first base coach for the Kansas City Monarchs of the American Association of Professional Baseball. He played his entire eighteen-year career in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for the Kansas City Royals from to and was an integral member of the 1985 World Series winning team.\nA five-time All-Star player, White was considered one of the best defensive second basemen of his era, winning eight Gold Glove Awards between and . He was the first American League (AL) second baseman to win the award eight times. Although he was recognized more for his solid defensive play, he posted a .545 batting average during the 1980 American League Championship Series to be named the Most Valuable Player of the series.\nAfter his playing career, he has worked as a professional baseball coach and television color commentator, and has been elected to public office in Jackson County, Missouri. A two-time Royals Player of the Year Award winner, in 1995 his uniform number 20 was retired and he was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nWhite was born in Greenville, Mississippi. After attending Longview Community College in Lee's Summit, Missouri, he rose through Minor League Baseball to reach the big leagues. Within the Royals' farm system, he played for the rookie league Gulf Coast League Royals (1971), Class A San Jose Bees (1972), Class AA Jacksonville Suns (1972), and Class AAA Omaha Royals (1973).\nPlaying career.\nWhite is one of only three MLB players, along with Ron Washington and U L Washington, who were products of the Royals Academy. Though initially disliked by Kansas City fans because he displaced the popular Cookie Rojas at second base, he went on to set a major-league record jointly with teammate George Brett, by appearing in 1,914 games together. The record stood until 1995, when it was broken by the Detroit Tigers' Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.\nA smooth fielder, White was a five-time All-Star. He won the Gold Glove Award eight times, including six consecutive seasons from 1977 to 1982. In 1977, he played 62 consecutive errorless games. In 1980, White was awarded the inaugural American League Championship Series MVP award in the 1980 ALCS against the New York Yankees, leading the Royals to their first World Series appearance.\nAlthough in his early years he was a singles hitter who contributed little to the Royals' run column, White improved markedly as an offensive player during his career, hitting 22 home runs two years in a row, in 1985 and 1986. Since the 1985 World Series was played without the designated hitter, White hit cleanup during that series, in place of Hal McRae. Until White, the only other second baseman to hit cleanup in a World Series was Jackie Robinson. In the 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his solo home run in the seventh off Mike Scott was the deciding run in a 3–2 American League victory.\nWhite retired as a player in 1990, after 18 seasons with Kansas City, having played 2324 regular season games with a .255 average, 160 home runs and 886 RBIs. Defensively, White posted a .984 fielding percentage at second base and .983 fielding percentage overall. He also hit for the cycle twice in his major league career, on September 26, 1979, in a 4–0 victory over the California Angels and on August 3, 1982, in a 6–5 win over the Detroit Tigers.\nPost-playing career.\nCoaching and front office.\nAfter the end of White's playing career, he was a first base coach with both the Boston Red Sox from 1994 to 1996, and with the Kansas City Royals from 1997 to 2001, wearing uniform number 20 for both teams. He then managed the Wichita Wranglers for three years before moving to Kansas City's front office. White was mentioned as a possible candidate for Royals' general manager Dayton Moore to consider as the successor to manager Buddy Bell after the 2007 season; the job ultimately went to Trey Hillman. White resigned from his position in the front office in January 2011.\nWhite is currently on the coaching staff of the Kansas City Monarchs in the American Association of Professional Baseball.\nBroadcasting.\nIn February 2008, it was announced that White was joining FSN Kansas City to serve as a part-time color commentator on Royals telecasts (filling in for Paul Splittorff on select games), as well as an analyst on the channel's \"Royals Live\" postgame show.\nFSN Kansas City announced in early December 2011 that White's broadcasting contract wouldn’t be renewed as the Royals' television color commentator.\nPolitics.\nWhite ran for the Jackson County Legislature in 2014 as a Democrat, winning the election of an at-large seat.\nOn January 11, 2016, White was appointed county executive by the Jackson County Legislature, for the remainder of 2016 following the resignation of Mike Sanders. In November 2016, White was elected to the same position, for a two-year term. He was reelected in 2018 and 2022.\nIn 2024, White vetoed an ordinance that would have created a ballot measure on renewing a 3/8th-cent sales tax to subsidize sports stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals. White argued that providing more than $2 billion of taxpayer money towards stadiums without any guarantee of long-term commitments from the teams would be a bad deal for taxpayers.\nHonors.\nWhite was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. On Sunday July 2, 1995, the Royals retired White's number 20, and the same year he was inducted into the Royals' Hall of Fame. A bronze statue of White was dedicated outside of Kauffman Stadium in 2004, joining Royals founders Ewing &amp; Muriel Kauffman, George Brett, and as of 2009, Dick Howser.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

In his early career, Williams was a talented sprinter, later becoming a member of the Wales rugby team that won the Five Nations Championship in 1975, 1976, 1978 and 1979, including Grand Slam wins in 1976 and 1978.\nWilliams played for the Bridgend Ravens and Llanelli RFC in the 1970s. His time at Llanelli included a famous win against the All Blacks in 1972. He was a key try creator and scorer for the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa. After his retirement in 1980, Williams became a pundit and commentator for BBC Cymru Wales and later a successful businessman. His son, Rhys, is a professional track and field athlete.\nCareer.\nWilliams was born in Nantyffyllon and received his primary education at Maesteg Grammar School. He later moved on to the Cardiff College of Education, which was described as \"a hotbed of sporting excellence\".

He previously played for Super League clubs Wigan Warriors and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats (twice) (Heritage No. 1308), and Salford Red Devils, and in Australia for the Parramatta Eels and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks of the National Rugby League in the NRL. Smith's usual position was in the halves.\nPlaying career.\nParramatta Eels.\nSmith started his NRL career with the Parramatta Eels and received much acclaim from Parramatta legend Peter Sterling, who \"handed over\" the Eels number 7 jersey in an episode of \"The NRL Footy Show\" in the middle of 2005. Smith played 26 games in the 2005 NRL season as Parramatta won the Minor Premiership. Along with St. George Illawarra, Parramatta were favorites to win the premiership in 2005 but were defeated 29-0 in the preliminary final by North Queensland at Telstra Stadium in an upset loss.\nAfter leading the competition in try assists he won the rookie of the year award at the 2005 Dally M Awards. With 40 try assists in his début season Smith was named the 2005 Parramatta Eels season's rookie of the year. As of the 2019 NRL season, Smith's 40 try assists is still an NRL record.\nIn December 2005, Smith was allegedly involved in a street scuffle with a man in the inner-Sydney suburb of the Rocks. He denied any such action and no charges were laid.\nIn 2006, Smith was involved in an altercation with Australian cricketer Michael Clarke after Clarke confronted Smith at the Northies Hotel in Cronulla. It was alleged that Smith was talking to Clarke's ex-girlfriend which led to the altercation.\nIn the 2007 NRL season, Smith played 27 games for Parramatta as the club made it to the preliminary final but fell short of a grand final appearance losing to Melbourne 26-10. In December 2007, further allegations of public drunken behaviour were made against Smith.\nSmith was suspended indefinitely by Parramatta. He remained on contract with the club, and Parramatta stated the most important issue was his health. Smith booked himself into full-time rehabilitation interstate. On 8 January 2008 the Parramatta Club reviewed his behaviour at the rehabilitation clinic and lifted his suspension but he was subject to a number of sanctions which included a fine and charity work.\nEarly in the 2008 season, after just three games of football, Smith advised his club and teammates that he was suffering from bipolar disorder. He then gave a statement to the media saying he had been given an indefinite leave from football, saying he was having trouble coping with the constant criticism from the media.\nSmith returned to his family in the Gold Coast, with the aim to rest and recuperate with the aim of returning to professional rugby league in the future.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan announced in June 2008 that they had signed Smith for the remainder of the 2008 season and 2009.\nSmith linked up with his new teammates in July once his work-permit has been approved, after weeks of visa complications. He played his professional début for the club in a home loss to Huddersfield, although the mental illness that had ended his season for the Parramatta Eels and lack of match fitness did produce some concern about his ability to play rugby league in Europe's top-flight competition, which was reflected in the terms of his contract to Wigan, despite his claims that his bipolar condition was now under control:\nSmith showed some excellent form in the first half of the 2009 season, putting together successive man of the match performances, but a shoulder injury ended his season early and he returned to Australia.\nRumours continued to revolve around Smith, with Cronulla looking the most likely home for the young, gifted playmaker. The star halfback declared he was hopeful of a return to the Eels and would take a $250,000 pay cut to make it happen.\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nHe signed with the Brisbane Broncos for the 2010 NRL season but did not make an appearance, which led to his move to the Sharks. In late 2009, Smith began training with the Brisbane Broncos in a bid to win a return to the NRL through their Queensland Cup feeder side Easts Tigers. Months later, he signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. In his first match back in the NRL, he played his former club the Parramatta Eels, and was influential in leading the Sharks to an 11–0 win, scoring a penalty goal and a field goal.\nHowever Smith's form subsequently dropped, which resulted in his axing to the NSW Cup.\nWakefield Trinity.\nSmith signed with Wakefield Trinity for the 2012 season and made his first public appearance at the Trinity kit launch on 8 December.\nSalford Red Devils.\nSmith signed with Salford Red Devils towards the end of the 2013 season, with the Chairman of his former club releasing a statement confirming that Salford had paid 'a substantial fee' for the half back.\nOn 10 June, Smith returned to Wakefield on loan until the end of the season. However, on the same day, Salford owner Marwan Koukash had to ditch players to fit Kevin Locke in the team. Locke had a high salary, and Tim and teammate Shannan McPherson had to leave in order for Locke to fit under the Salary Cap and avoid breach.\nReturn to Wakefield Trinity.\nIn October 2014, Smith rejoined Wakefield on a one-year deal. On 1 October 2015, Smith was terminated by Wakefield for gross misconduct and for bringing the club into disrepute.\nIt was alleged at the time that Smith along with teammate Kevin Locke had crashed his car into another vehicle and into the wall of a house. Smith attended Beverley magistrates court and was banned from driving for 28 months and fined £900 after admitting failing to provide a specimen following the car crash in September 2015. The 30-year-old was also handed a £600 fine for careless driving. Smith had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into the car crash but failed to attend a hearing after submitting a sick note citing anxiety.\nWakefield chairman Michael Carter said to the media \"A letter was last night sent to Tim Smith and his lawyer saying we were dismissing him for gross misconduct and bringing the club into disrepute. After Smith was terminated by Wakefield, Kevin Locke was also terminated on the same day.\nPost-playing career.\nIn November 2018, Smith was announced as assistant coach of the Victoria Thunderbolts. On 19 November 2018, Smith played for Parramatta in the Legends of League tournament held at the Central Coast Stadium in Gosford. Smith became coach of the Quaker Valley rugby team in 2019."

        "title": "Bryan Fletcher (rugby league)",
        "text": "Bryan Nathan Hindmarsh Fletcher (born 12 April 1974) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative second-row-forward, he played his club football in Australia with the Sydney Roosters and the South Sydney Rabbitohs, before a stint in England with Wigan.\nSydney Roosters.\nFletcher's junior club was the Paddington Colts in the Eastern Suburbs District Junior Rugby League. He started his top-level career at the Sydney Roosters in the second row in the 1997 ARL season. Despite only 24 National Rugby League appearances, Fletcher was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at second-row forward in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory. Over the years Fletcher would gain 13 caps for the Australian national side and also play 14 games for New South Wales in the State of Origin matches.\nOne of the highlights of Fletcher's Sydney Roosters career was his appearance at second-row forward in the 2000 NRL Grand Final, their first in 20 years. He also helped Australia inflict a humiliating defeat on the New Zealand national team 52–0 as well as a 3–0 whitewash of Queensland in the State of Origin series. Fletcher is perhaps best known in Origin circles for his hand grenade try celebration which he performed in 2000 series where NSW thumped QLD 56-16. It is believed that the try celebration forced Queensland to change their whole strategy towards Origin and it created a pathway for Queensland to win fourteen of eighteen series since 2006 (including a record eight straight between 2006 and 2013). Former Queensland player Wendell Sailor said “As a Queenslander, you never forget that\". Queensland Origin great Gorden Tallis had previously spoken about how that try celebration eventually led to a shift in the State of Origin balance of power which saw Queensland win back the Shield in 2001. Former player Matthew Johns claims that the try celebration started a Queensland dynasty. Former Queensland coach Chris Close spoke about Fletcher's try celebration in 2016 \"I thought it was disgraceful act and a disgraceful show of disrespect, You would certainly never, ever see that from any Queensland team, It still burns. F---ing oath it does\".\nFletcher achieved even more success in the 2002 season. He played for the Roosters from the interchange bench in their 30-8 win over the New Zealand Warriors in the 2002 NRL Grand Final in front of 80,130 fans at the Telstra Stadium. He scored the final try in the 74th minute in what was his 135th and final appearance for the red, white and blue, before moving to rivals the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs.\nFletcher left the Roosters and moved to perennial strugglers the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2003. Fletcher was soon installed as the club's captain after signing due to his playing pedigree. In 2003 he won the George Piggins Medal as the club's best and fairest player of the season.\nThe Rabbitohs' captaincy was stripped from him after an altercation on the pitch with Parramatta Eels player Dean Widders in which Fletcher made a racist comment towards Widders. It turned out to be the turning point in the Rabbitohs' season, with Ashley Harrison taking the captaincy from him and the Rabbitohs winning most of their matches under him in a late season surge which saw them avoid a third consecutive wooden spoon.\nHe later apologised for the event, saying: \"I apologise unreservedly for comments that I made to Dean Widders in yesterday's game. The comments were totally unacceptable and for that I am sorry. \"My actions have set a very poor example for kids who follow Rugby League and these types of comments cannot be tolerated in our game.\"\nWigan Warriors.\nBefore the scandal that led to Fletcher being stripped of his captaincy, banned for 1 game and fined A$10,000 he had agreed to a move to England to play for Super League club; Wigan Warriors after three years at Souths. Fletcher joined the Wigan club in 2006 in time for the pre season training but was sidelined for the opening four rounds of Super League after needing emergency Bowel Surgery in early January.\nFletcher's début came against Warrington Wolves on 10 March 2006 at the JJB Stadium in Wigan, and made an instant impact as a substitute scoring his first try three minutes into his first appearance. He was one of the stalwarts that helped Wigan through one of the most tumultuous times in the club's history on and off the field in 2006 with the dismissal of coach Ian Millward, the low morale within the team and seeing the once feared Wigan club sitting at the bottom of the table. Thanks to Fletcher's impact in the and the positions Wigan managed the seemingly impossible and survived relegation from the Super League, finishing 7th and just missing a playoff place to local rivals Warrington.\nPlaying statistics.\nAt the end of the 2007 Super League season, Bryan Fletcher retired from competitive rugby league. He had played in 125 games for the Sydney Roosters, 45 for Souths, and a further 55 for Wigan. He also played 2 games for City Origin, 14 State of Origin games for NSW and 13 Test and World Cup matches for Australia.\nPersonal life.\nHe got married in 2003, to Britt Fletcher. Together they had 3 daughters, Scarlett, Maya, and Lucca. When he retired from playing in 2007, Fletcher and his business partner Craig Markham began a cleaning company called Cleanfit. The company cleans a number of pubs, clubs and office blocks in Sydney. It also allows Fletcher, who is a qualified plumber, to utilise his trade in order to help with the business.\nIn 2013, Bryan Fletcher was a regular presenter on Channel 9's weekly football season program \"The Footy Show\". Fletcher presented the \"Kick for Cash\" segment.\nIn 2014, Bryan Fletcher joined Fox Sports \"Monday Night with Matty Johns' forming a duo with fellow former NRL player Nathan Hindmarsh. Fletcher and Hindmarsh participate in many challenges set by the producers. 'Fletch and Hindy' created their own spoof NRL bid team known as the 'Nepal Donkeys.\nIn July 2018, Fletcher made the headlines after he was allegedly set up by an Uber driver buying cocaine. The Uber driver reportedly filmed Fletcher in a snapchat video saying \"Look who I'm selling bags to …\". Fletcher responded with \"Don't say that, I don't know who this driver is, we're just hanging out it's Saturday night, I'm just in an Uber\". Fletcher's manager Steve Gillis told the media \"The driver asked him for a quick Snapchat video he's been set up. \"Fletcher told me that he's never met the bloke, he just jumped in the back of his cab and driver pulled this stunt he's clearly been set up\".\nIn 2019, Bryan was chosen to be part of the core host ensemble for the Unibet Australia weekly television format program \"At Odds\"."

Traded to the Angels one month after the expansion franchise began play in 1961, he tied for third in Rookie of the Year voting after batting .285 with 24 home runs and 70 runs batted in (RBI), primarily playing in the outfield. The following year, he was named to the American League (AL) All-Star team after shifting to first base, and appeared in both All-Star games played that year as a pinch hitter and late-inning defensive replacement. He finished the year with career highs in batting (.290), home runs (26) and RBI (104), but a sharp decline in 1963 led to his being traded to the Boston Red Sox in mid-1964, the first of four trades before the 1968 season.\nAfter finishing his major league career with a .255 average, 106 home runs and 428 RBI, Thomas played for the Nankai Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1969. He played one more season in the minor leagues, then joined the St. Louis Cardinals as a coach for two years, followed by two years managing in the minors, before returning to the Cardinals organization to help them reach the World Series three times in the 1980s. Hired as the Phillies' general manager in 1988, he rebuilt the team's roster and assembled the team which advanced to the 1993 World Series; he served in the role until 1997 before spending another twenty years serving four teams as a scout and front-office executive.\nPlaying career.\nThomas was born in Peoria, Illinois, on February 5, 1936, and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, with his family as a child. He graduated from Beaumont High School in St. Louis in 1954, and was signed by New York Yankees scout Lou Maguolo. Thomas spent seven years in the minor leagues, putting up good offensive statistics in minor league baseball. He had two at bats for the Yankees in 1961 and garnered one hit, a pinch single off future Baseball Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm, then with the Baltimore Orioles, on April 22 in his first MLB at bat.\nOn May 8, the Yankees traded Thomas, Ryne Duren, and Johnny James to the one-month-old Los Angeles Angels for Bob Cerv and Tex Clevenger. The trade began his five-year tenure as an everyday player: he appeared in 486 games for the Angels, and 258 more for the Boston Red Sox, who acquired him for outfielder Lou Clinton on June 4, 1964. From 1961 to 1965, Thomas topped the 20 home run mark three times, and drove in 104 runs batted in for the Angels in . On September 5, 1961, Thomas collected nine hits in 11 at bats in a doubleheader against the Kansas City Athletics, hitting three home runs and driving in eight runs in the nightcap. He became one of eight players with nine hits in a doubleheader. He was selected to the 1962 American League All-Star team, and popped out as a pinch hitter in that year's first All-Star game, played at DC Stadium on July 10. In the year's second All-Star game, played July 30 at Wrigley Field, he appeared as a defensive replacement in left field for the game's final two innings and did not bat.\nOn December 15, 1965, the Red Sox traded Thomas, Arnold Earley, and a player to be named later (Jay Ritchie) to the Atlanta Braves for Dan Osinski and Bob Sadowski. Thomas was the starting first baseman in the first game in the Braves' Atlanta history, going hitless in five at bats on April 12, 1966, against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. Thomas held the starting job for the first full month of the season hitting .198 in 126 at bats. On May 28, 1966, the Braves traded him to the Chicago Cubs for Ted Abernathy. He then served as a part-time player and pinch hitter with the Cubs and Houston Astros, where he was dealt for two minor-league players on February 9, 1968, through the end of the 1968 campaign. He played in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Nankai Hawks in 1969. After he signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals organization for the 1970 season, they assigned him to the Tulsa Oilers of the American Association, where he concluded his 17-year pro playing career at age 34. \nIn Major League Baseball, Thomas compiled a career batting average of .255 in 1,027 games played with 847 hits and 106 home runs.\nFront office career.\nIn 1971, Thomas joined the MLB Cardinals as bullpen coach. In 1973, he became manager of the GCL Red Birds in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Then, in 1974, Thomas moved up to Class A as skipper of the Modesto Reds of the California League. Thomas moved into the Cardinals' front office in 1975, becoming traveling secretary and rising to the position of director of player development in 1980. He was a key member of the St. Louis organization during the club's run of success during the early to mid-1980s when the Cards, led by manager Whitey Herzog, won NL pennants in , and and the 1982 World Series.\nIn June , the Philadelphia Phillies hired Thomas as their general manager. He acquired players such as Curt Schilling, Lenny Dykstra and Mitch Williams, who played critical roles in the Phillies' 1993 pennant-winning team, which lost the 1993 World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays. That same year, \"The Sporting News\" named him Executive of the Year for all of Major League Baseball.\nWhen four straight losing seasons followed the 1993 pennant, Thomas was fired and replaced as general manager by Ed Wade, his assistant. He then returned to the Red Sox as a special assistant to Dan Duquette, Boston's general manager, in 1998. He played a key role in Boston's signing of free agent outfielders Manny Ramírez in December 2000 and Johnny Damon one year later. He served the Astros and the Milwaukee Brewers as a scout, and on December 4, 2011, he joined the Baltimore Orioles as a special assistant to Duquette, who was the executive vice president. He served in the role until the end of the season.\nPersonal life and death.\nThomas was married twice and had four children. He died at his home in St. Louis on August 31, 2022, at age 86."

The FINA World Aquatics Championships has featured open water swimming events since 1992. The FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships was held from 2000 to 2010. Since 2007, the FINA 10 km Marathon Swimming World Cup is held in several events around the world.\nEvents such as the Midmar Mile in South Africa (attributed to Wayne Ridden), the Great Swim in the UK (whose idea is attributed to Colin Hill), and the Batley race have helped create and grow interest and participation in the sport.\nRacing techniques.\nStroke.\nThough most open water races do not require a specific stroke, most competitors employ the front crawl, also known as freestyle. The efficiency of this stroke was demonstrated by Gertrude Ederle, who, as the first woman to swim the English Channel, employed it to beat the existing world record by more than 2 hours.\nSighting.\nWhen covering large distances, swimmers may head off course due to current, waves, wind, and poor visibility. Typically, buoys are stationed periodically across a large expanse to provide guidance. However, buoys are often invisible due to interference from choppy water and reduced visibility through goggles. Swimmers are encouraged to 'triangulate' by looking for two aligned, easily visible objects on land that are directly behind the destination (such as the end of a pier as it lines up with a hilltop), and to make sure they continue to appear aligned during the race.\nDrafting.\nDrafting, which is prohibited by some race regulations, is the technique of following another swimmer so closely that water resistance is reduced. When swimming closely alongside or behind a swimmer in the lead swimmer's wake, resistance is reduced and the amount of effort to swim at the same speed is correspondingly reduced. In calmer conditions, or when facing surface chop, swimmers can also significantly benefit from swimming immediately behind or closely alongside a swimmer of comparable or faster speed. Not all race organizers permit drafting, and swimmers can run the risk of disqualification if they are caught.\nBeach starting/exiting.\nWhen entering the water, swimmers can use techniques to take advantage of the shallow water. One such technique is walking along the bottom. Another technique is \"dolphining\", which involves diving down to the bottom and launching oneself upwards and forwards. This technique can also help to avoid incoming waves. When exiting the water, swimmers can body surf to take advantage of waves.\nEquipment used in competitions.\nThe equipment allowed in a race depends on the sanctioning body and/or the race organizers. For example, races may have divisions for wetsuits and/or relays; may require escort boats / kayakers / paddleboards; and may require specifically colored swim caps. Some swimmers tend to keep it simple, using a basic swimsuit, goggles, and swim cap. Many records are based on that attire, which is known as 'channel attire' because it is stipulated in the rules for English Channel crossings and the rules for other long swims. Swimmers often utilize changing robes to dry off and change into or out of their swimwear attire in often cold and public places.\nWetsuit usage.\nFor triathlons, competitive rule 4.4 of USA Triathlon, states that \"each age group participant shall be permitted to wear a wetsuit without penalty in any event sanctioned by USA Triathlon up to and including a water temperature of .\" The ITU rule is that wetsuits are allowed for elite triathlons at below if or more, and below if shorter. Wetsuits are mandatory in triathlons below if or more.\nVarious types of wetsuits of varying thicknesses are used in open water swimming. Some employ high-tech materials and workmanship, others are of basic materials found in surfing and diving wetsuits. Some designs cover the torso, arms and legs, while other designs leave the arms and shoulders exposed.\nWhen a person floats motionless in the water, their legs tend to sink. When a person swims freestyle, the legs rise toward surface because water passing underneath the body pushes the legs up, similar to how the wind can lift a kite into the air. In addition, a proper kicking technique will bring the legs all the way to the surface, creating a more streamlined profile for the arms to pull through the water. Both of these mechanisms of becoming horizontal require a small amount of energy from the swimmer. When a person wearing a thick wetsuit floats motionless in the water, their legs tend to float on the surface. Theoretically, this obviates the small energy expenditure mentioned above, although an additional small amount of energy is required to continually flex the wetsuit during swimming motions.\nHigh-end triathlon wetsuits have extra flexibility that provides easier range of motion than a surfing or diving wetsuit. Some triathlon wetsuits have varied thickness by way of panels that provide custom flotation that aids the wearer in keeping an efficient position in the water.\nCompetitions.\nOpen water swimming is an Olympic-sanctioned discipline. It has been included in the Olympic Games since 2008, and the FINA World Aquatics Championships since 1991."

        "title": "Cricket Ireland",
        "text": "Cricket Ireland, officially the Irish Cricket Union, is the national governing body for cricket on the island of Ireland (both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland), and oversees the national men's and women's cricket teams. It also organises the Inter-Provincial Series (which includes the Inter-Provincial Championship, Inter-Provincial Cup and Inter-Provincial Trophy), Super 3s, and three All-Ireland club competitions: Irish Senior Cup, National Cup and the All-Ireland T20 Cup. It achieved Test status for women in 2000, and for men in 2017 when it was made a Full Member of the ICC in June 2017.\nHistory.\nAn early forerunner of the Irish Cricket Union was formed in 1890, though its only function was to select the Irish international team. The Irish Cricket Union was officially founded in 1923, and is made up of five provincial unions, namely the Leinster Cricket Union, the Munster Cricket Union, the Northern Cricket Union, the Connacht Cricket Union and the North West Cricket Union. Its powers initially were strictly limited and it was reconstituted in 1933.\nIreland was accepted as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council on 6 July 1993.\nIn common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union represents all of the island of Ireland, rather than just the Republic of Ireland. In common with its counterparts for rugby union and field hockey, the organisation, therefore, does not use the Irish tricolour, but instead employs its own flag.\nIreland was initially of the teams in Division 1 of Associate Members of International Cricket Council who has One Day International and T20 International status.\nIreland's greatest cricketing success to date was to reach the \"Super 8\" of the 2007 Cricket World Club following victory over Pakistan and a tied game with Zimbabwe in the groups stages. The most significant, and most publicised, success in a one-off match occurred four years later, with a three-wicket victory over England in 2011 Cricket World Cup in which Kevin O'Brien scored the World Cup's fastest ever century and Ireland set a World Cup record with by \"chasing\" 327 runs. During 2007 World Cup Ireland had major success with their victory by three wickets over Pakistan in a 2007 Cricket World Cup group match.\nThe victory over Pakistan in 2007 was overshadowed by the sudden death of the Pakistan Coach Bob Woolmer that night. Ireland also managed to beat the West Indies in their prime in 1968 at Sion Mills, 25 years before Ireland were accepted as an associate by the ICC. \nThe Irish Cricket Union was formally dissolved and then formed afresh as a limited company on 3 February 2008, at its annual general meeting.\nAfter the tremendous success at International stage, Cricket Ireland has applied for Full Membership from the International Cricket Council. Ireland have recently won the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2008 and 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier and qualified for 2009 World Twenty20 and 2011 Cricket World Cup. Being a full member will allow Ireland to be a permanent One Day International and eventually granting them Test status.\nIn August 2011, Cricket Ireland announced its plans to put in place a first-class structure, which is a major achievement for the nation on their path to gaining Test status.\nIn 2012, Cricket Ireland announced that it had found the pathway to Test status for their tremendously successful men's team by 2020. Targets include an increase in the number of people playing the game in Ireland to 50,000, reaching eighth in the world rankings and establishing a domestic first-class structure. A number of commercial deals have been secured, allowing Ireland to unveil their strategic plan to 2015 and target their ultimate ambition of securing Test status.\nCricket Ireland has offered a record 23 professional contracts to players, in three categories, for 2012, a development Phil Simmons says is vital for their continued improvement. Simmons, the Ireland coach, has also agreed a two-year extension to his contract which will take him through to at least the end of Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign late next year.\nInitiatives to swell participation numbers to 50,000 will include the establishment of regional academies; a Get into Cricket scheme which will seek to attract six to 12-year-olds to take up the game in clubs and schools; a Better Clubs Initiative, which will encourage clubs to improve their facilities; and the Cricket Ireland national awards which will recognise contributions ranging from players to volunteers. In another sign of the growing popularity of cricket in Ireland, the Irish provided a record 23 national contracts for the 2012 season, which also included not only the senior and regular members of the squad, but also fringe players. The contracts, for the first time, were divided into sections: Category A, Category B, and Category C (for fringe players).\nIn June 2017, the ICC awarded Full Membership to Ireland and Afghanistan, allowing them the opportunity to play Test matches.\nObjectives.\nVision to 2020 - Ireland a Test nation\nGrass roots initiatives.\nReflecting the rising popularity of the game in Ireland, Cricket Ireland committed to developing the grass roots of the sport over the next four years. New plans were unveiled to provide a significant boost to the domestic game with a series of initiatives designed to strengthen the game on the island and help achieve the ambitious target of 50,000 participants by 2015.\nThe initiatives include:-\nSource: Official Website"

        "title": "Bowling, West Dunbartonshire",
        "text": "Bowling (, ) is a village in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, with a population of 740 (2015).\nIt lies on the north bank of the Firth of Clyde, between the towns of Clydebank and Dumbarton. It is west of Old Kilpatrick which is at one end of the Antonine Wall and therefore represents the extreme limit of the Roman Empire on the west coast of the island of Great Britain.\nForth and Clyde Canal.\nBowling is the location of the western terminus of the Forth and Clyde Canal, opened in 1790, and it is the western gateway to the Lowland canals.\nIn 2008, British Waterways Scotland, in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire, completed a £1.4 million regeneration programme at Bowling Basin to provide additional moorings and improved facilities. At the time there were plans for future use of an area of of land adjacent to Bowling, in conjunction with Clydeport.\nIn June 2008, Lord Provost Denis Agnew, joined local schoolchildren and community groups to celebrate the completion of a £163,000 project to improve seven kilometres of towpath on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal from Bowling Harbour to Whitecrook in Clydebank.\nIn 2007, Bowling welcomed the \"Vital Spark\", one of only five surviving Clyde puffers, and the first of its kind to sail into Bowling Harbour for more than 40 years. The Forth &amp; Clyde Canal is regarded as the birthplace of the puffers, which had to be small enough to negotiate the Crinan Canal. The archetypal puffer, the Vital Spark, appeared in the \"Para Handy\" books by Neil Munro and two television series of the same name.\nShipbuilding in Bowling.\nBowling has been long associated with shipbuilding and ship repairing.\nThe opening of the Forth and Clyde canal at Bowling in 1790 increased the number of vessels passing through the small village on their way to Glasgow.\nThe first shipbuilding name in Bowling is that of Thomas MacGill, originally from Glasgow. He rented the Graving dock in 1800, for which he paid £25 in the first year. McGill and two of his sons built vessels at Bowling until 1843 when the yard was forced to close due to an extension of the Forth and Clyde Canal basin.\nIn 1834 George Mills and Charles Wood entered into partnership, opening a shipyard at Littlemill in Bowling, at the other end of the bay from Thomas MacGill. This partnership did not last long, as Charles Wood left to set up a shipyard in Dumbarton on his own. In 1840/1 George Mills retired from shipbuilding and the shipyard closed.\nIn 1851 a new partnership was formed at Bowling between Thomas MacGill's two sons, David and Thomas, and James Scott, whose father owned land at Littlemill. The company was known as Scott &amp; MacGill. The shipyard was located on ground known as Frisky Hall Orchard and this small yard built wooden sailing vessels until, in 1874, it built its first iron vessel.\nIn 1876 Thomas MacGill retired from the firm, leaving James Scott on his own and the name of the company was changed to Scott and Company. A partnership was formed in 1892 between James Scott and his two sons, Charles Wood Scott and James Scott Junior. The firm's name was changed again, to Scott and Sons. The firm continued to prosper well into the twentieth century, building in excess of 450 vessels, many of these being passenger vessels and coasters for Gardner &amp; Stewart. In 1958, following the retirement of James W. Scott, the firm became a limited company, trading under the name Scott Sons (Bowling) Limited.\nIn June 1965, the company was taken over by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock. In 1979 the decision was taken to close the shipbuilding yard. The last vessel to leave the yard was the Laggan built for Forth Tugs Limited of Grangemouth.\nOne well-known ship built by Scott was the \"MV Saint Bedan\", launched in January 1937. After several changes of ownership and name, it became MV Panagiotis and allegedly spent its later life as a smuggling ship in the Ionian Sea. It ran aground at Navagio Beach on the Ionian Island of Zakynthos (Zante) in 1980, becoming one of the most picturesque and well-visited shipwrecks in the world.\nGlenarbuck House.\nGlenarbuck House is a Category B listed building in Bowling. It was built in 1804 for the merchant Gilbert Hamilton (1744–1808) who was the first president of the Glasgow Humane Society, a founding member of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and Glasgow's Lord Provost in 1792. Later owners included the Duke of Sutherland and the Scott family of the shipbuilders Scott and Sons.\nRail transport.\nBowling railway station opened in 1850 when the North Clyde line ran via Dumbarton to Balloch. In 1858 the line was extended to progress to Glasgow to the east, and Helensburgh to the west. Between 1896 and 1951, the village was also served by a second station, on Caledonian Railway's Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway line. Its former trackbed now forms a footpath and cycleway through the village.\nToday ScotRail services call at Bowling, two trains per hour each direction.\nBowling today.\nBowling is in the same parish as Old Kilpatrick Church and the former church in Bowling has been converted into housing.\nThe village has an annual Gala Day in June, at which a girl is crowned Queen for a day. The ceremony starts at Bowling Memorial Park and continues to Bowling Hall.\nBowling also has an annual cheese running competition where locals chase rolls of cheese down the Kilpatrick hills. The winner is awarded a giant roll of cheese and has the village hall named after them until next year's cheese race. Steven Donnachie is currently the record holder, having won the cheese race 6 times. (This event does not exist and videos in relation to this are taken from elsewhere.)"

They could have taken the championship if they had beaten Sussex in the last game at Hove but, after gaining a five-run lead on first innings, Surrey let Billy Murdoch, C. B. Fry and George Bean make half-centuries, and rain spoiled their chances of winning on the final day. At the bottom of the table, Derbyshire suffered a run of 16 matches without victory to finish last in the table and, with the end of the 1896 season having yielded three matches without a win, Derbyshire's streak ran to 19 matches without a win.\nCounty Championship.\nFinal table.\nPoints system:"

        "title": "Association of Volleyball Professionals",
        "text": "The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) is the biggest and longest-running professional beach volleyball tour in the United States. Founded in 1983, the AVP is headquartered in Newport Beach, California. The AVP operates as a 3-tiered development system with AVPFirst, a youth program; AVPNext, a developmental circuit; and the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour itself.\nHistory.\n19831997: Origins and early history.\nThe AVP was formed in 1983 as a player's union. Following a dispute with a private promoter at the 1984 World Championships in Redondo Beach, California, the AVP began organizing its own men's tour in 1984. The 1985 AVP tour included stops in eight U.S. states with a total prize money of US$275,000. The sport experienced significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 1993, the AVP tour had a total prize money of US$3.7 million with ten events that were broadcast on NBC Sports and attended by over 600,000 people. The AVP began organizing women's events in 1993, competing with the Women's Professional Volleyball Association (WPVA), the main women's tour that began in 1986.\nThe AVP had conflicts with the sport's international governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), in the 1980s and 1990s over regulations and sponsorship. This culminated in an initial boycott of FIVB Olympic qualification events by the top American players in the lead up to beach volleyball's Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The boycott ended in mid-1995 after an agreement between both parties was reached.\n19982010: Bankruptcies and restructuring.\nBy 1997, sponsors started to withdraw due to the mounting financial problems and mismanagement in the AVP. In 1998, the AVP filed for bankruptcy and new management restructured the AVP from a players union to a for-profit privately owned company. The tour was bought out of bankruptcy the following year by Major League Volleyball and twelve events were held with a total prize money of US$1 million. In 2001, the tour was bought by Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. The new tour combined the men's and women's professional tours. The tour also adopted the FIVB's smaller court size and rally scoring system, which upset many of the tour's players at the time.\nIn 2006, Crocs signed on as the title sponsor of the tour, which became known as the AVP Crocs Tour until its suspension in 2010. Other corporate sponsors for the tour included McDonald's, Nautica, Anheuser-Busch, Nature Valley and Xbox. By 2008, the AVP had an annual revenue of nearly US$25 million and were organizing as many as 31 events each year. However, the tour was hit badly by the financial crisis of 2007–2008 which saw it lose sponsors and revenue.\nThe AVP suspended its operations in August 2010, canceling the five remaining tournaments in the tour calendar and filing for bankruptcy once more. During the AVP's absence, two other domestic professional tours, the National Volleyball League (NVL) and the Jose Cuervo Pro Volleyball Beach Series, were formed.\n2011present: Re-emergence.\nThe AVP was bought in December 2010 by DFA PVA II Partners, LLC, and a tournament was held in Huntington Beach, California in October 2011. In April 2012, the AVP was bought by Donald Sun and two tournaments, the Cincinnati Open and the 2012 AVP Championships, were held later that year. The first full AVP season under Sun began in 2013. Facing competition from the NVL, the AVP required players competing on the 2017 AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour to sign a four-year exclusivity contract.\nSince its re-emergence in 2013, the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour has once again established itself as the biggest professional beach volleyball tour in the United States, with most of the top American players competing on the tour. International players are allowed to play on the AVP tour as well if they have dual citizenship or permanent residency in the United States. Notable international players on the tour include Brazil's Ricardo Santos and Canada's Sarah Pavan.\nOn July 13, 2021, casino operator Bally's Corporation announced that it had acquired the AVP. The tour will leverage Sinclair Broadcast Group's Bally Sports regional sports networks as a distribution channel for AVP events.\nRules.\nSince the 2017 season, there are two main differences between the AVP rules and standard beach volleyball rules. The first difference is that AVP matches have a \"point freeze\" at match point, wherein the scoring system changes from rally scoring (either team can score a point on every serve) to side-out scoring (only serving team can score a point) when either team reaches match point. This rule was introduced to allow for more comebacks. The second difference is that \"let\" serves, wherein the ball touches the net while crossing over into the opponent's court during service, are not allowed during \"point freezes\" and the serve will be replayed.\nTournament categories.\nThe current tournament structure was introduced in 2017. AVP tournaments are categorized as either a \"Gold Series\" or \"Open\" event. Gold Series tournaments award more prize money and AVP national ranking points. For the 2017 Tour, Open events had a prize purse of US$150,000$158,000 while Gold Series events had a prize purse of US$175,000$225,000.\nAVPNext and AVPFirst.\nAVPNext was started in 2014 as a developmental circuit, serving as a pipeline for future AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour players.\nAVPNext tournaments enable players to earn AVP national ranking points which are required for qualification and seeding in the Pro Tour events. The highest-ranked AVPNext teams from each region at the end of the season also receive direct entry into the Manhattan Beach Open. For the 2019 season, the AVPNext Gold events had a prize purse of US$20,000–25,000.\nAVPFirst was launched in 2015 as a non-profit youth development program aimed at increasing youth participation in the sport through beach volleyball clinics and events. The inaugural AVPFirst Championships were held in Hermosa Beach, California in 2016 for boys and girls in the under-12, under-14, under-16 and under-18 age groups. Teams qualified through a series of qualifying events throughout the country.\nTelevision coverage.\nAVP events are televised on ESPN+ (Stadium Court) and the Bally Live App. Select events air on the linear ESPN networks\nAVP Awards.\nThe AVP Awards Banquet takes place at the end of each year, honoring the tour's top performers based on statistics, player votes and AVP national ranking points earned during the year."

        "text": "Eric Miller (born 23 September 1975) is a former Irish rugby union and Gaelic football player. As a rugby player Miller played for, among others Old Wesley, Leicester Tigers, Ulster, Leinster, the Barbarians, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. After retiring as a rugby player, Miller switched football codes and went on to play Gaelic football for the Dublin county team.\nEarly years.\nAs a schoolboy and youth, Miller played several sports. He was educated at Wesley College where he played both rugby union and cricket.\nAt the same time he played association football for Leicester Celtic, a team whose former players also included Damian Duff.\nHe also played Gaelic football for Ballyboden St Enda's and, together with Brian Stynes, he helped them win a Dublin Under 21 Championship title in 1995.\nMiller eventually opted to concentrate on rugby union and spent the 1995–96 season playing for Old Wesley. He also represented Leinster for the first time at senior level.\nLeicester Tigers.\nIn 1996 Miller joined Leicester Tigers and went on to make 12 appearances for them in the Heineken Cup. His impressive performances for the Tigers saw him make his debut for Ireland and then represent the British and Irish Lions. While playing for the Tigers, he also attended both Loughborough University, where he studied for a degree in physical education at Sheffield Hallam University.\nLeinster.\nMiller first played for Leinster during the 1995–96 season while still attached to Old Wesley. After his spell with Leicester Tigers he returned to Ireland and initially linked up with Terenure College RFC and Ulster. In 2000, he returned to Leinster and went on to make 148 appearances for the province in the Celtic League and the Heineken Cup. Back at Leinster he helped them win the 2001–02 Celtic League title.\nRugby international.\nIreland.\nAs well as winning senior caps, Miller also represented Ireland at schoolboy, U21 and A levels.

On 5 December 2006, he played his first senior game for the Dublin county team against Louth. He has since ended his short return to GAA.\nSince finishing with Gaelic football, Miller set up his own personal training company called the real golf solution.\nCoaching.\nMiller has also had a successful coaching career. In September 2006 he undertook a coaching position in Wesley College, Dublin until 2009. He also coached for Old Wesley as well as Saint Gerard's School.\nIn 2011, he was appointed Head Coach Blackrock College Rugby Club Dublin.

        "text": "The Croatia men's national basketball team () represents Croatia in international basketball matches. The team is controlled by the Croatian Basketball Federation (HKS).\nThe biggest success Croatia has achieved was at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics when the team reached the final against the United States and won the silver medal. Croatia has also won one bronze medal at the FIBA World Cup and two bronze medals at EuroBasket.\nCroatia's Krešimir Ćosić, Dražen Petrović, Dino Rađa, Mirko Novosel and Toni Kukoč are members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ćosić was inducted in 1996, Petrović in 2002, Rađa in 2018 and Kukoč in 2021, all as players. Novosel was inducted in 2007 as a coach. Petrović, Ćosić, Kukoč and Novosel are members of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Ćosić is also the only Croatian to have received the FIBA Order of Merit. Ćosić, however, never played for the Croatia national team. As he was only a member of the Yugoslavia national team, holding the record for number of medals (including Olyimpic gold) and the most games played by a player.\nHistory.\nPrior to Croatian independence.\nCroatia played its first unofficial friendly game on 2 June 1964 in Karlovac. Croatian team played against US All Star Team and lost 65–110 (31–50). USA players coached by Red Auerbach were Bob Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Bob Pettit, Oscar Robertson and Bill Russell and Croatian team was Giuseppe Gjergja, Nemanja Đurić, Živko Kasun, Zlatko Kiseljak, Slobodan Kolaković, Dragan Kovačić, Boris Križan, Stjepan Ledić, Mirko Novosel, Marko Ostarčević, Petar Skansi and Željko Troskot.\nIndependent Croatia.\nAfter independence of Croatia in 1991, the first official tournament played by Croatians were the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Croatia defeated the CIS team 75–74 and reached the final against the USA Dream Team led by Michael Jordan. The USA won 85–117, but Croatia won its first medal at a major tournament in history.\nThe next competition for Croatia was the 1993 EuroBasket in Germany. Tragically, before the tournament Dražen Petrović died in a car accident on 7 June 1993 at the age of 28. Croatia still managed to reach the bronze medal game to defeat Greece 99–59.\nCroatia earned its third medal at the 1994 FIBA World Cup in Canada. Croatia lost their semi-finals match against Russia 64–66, but beat Greece once again 78–60 for the bronze medal. A similar occurrence happened at the EuroBasket 1995 in Greece. Croatia lost in the semi-finals 80–90 against Lithuania, but beat Greece 73–68 for the third time in a row in a bronze medal match. That medal to date was the last Croatian medal from any major tournament. At the 1996 Summer Olympics Croatia finished in a subpar seventh place.\nDecline.\nAt the EuroBasket 1997 in Spain, the new Croatian generation emerged, but ended in 11th place. Croatia failed to qualify for the 2000, 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics, but finished sixth in 2008. Croatia also failed to qualify for the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups. Although the team did manage to qualify in 2010, before falling in the Round of 16. However, at the EuroBasket 2013, Croatia had its best tournament appearance since 1995, where the team finished in fourth place.\nHonours.\nThe Croatia national team's all-time medal table:\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against France and Cyprus.\nHead-to-head record.\nBiggest tournament wins.\n\"20+ point difference\"\nBiggest tournament losses.\n\"-20&gt; point difference\"\nBiggest qualification wins.\n\"20+ point difference\""

        "title": "Basketball at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Basketball at the Summer Olympics has been a sport for men consistently since 1936. Prior to its inclusion as a medal sport, basketball was held as an unofficial demonstration event in 1904 and 1924. Women's basketball made its debut in the Summer Olympics in 1976. FIBA organizes both the men's and women's FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments and the Summer Olympics basketball tournaments, which are sanctioned by the IOC.\nThe United States is by far the most successful country in Olympic basketball, with United States men's teams having won 16 of 19 tournaments in which they participated, including seven consecutive titles from 1936 through 1968. United States women's teams have won eight titles out of the 10 tournaments in which they competed, including seven in a row from 1996 to 2020. Besides the United States, Argentina is the only nation still in existence which has won either the men's or women's tournament. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Unified Team are the countries no longer in existence who have won the tournament. The United States are the defending champions in both men's and women's tournaments.\nOn 9 June 2017, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee announced that 3x3 basketball would become an official Olympic sport as of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, for both men and women.\nHistory.\nBasketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Within a few decades, the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport. The popularity spread overseas and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was organized in 1932 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) had a big part in the spread of this sport to many countries, and as many as 21 teams competed in the first Olympic basketball tournament.\nAmerican dominance.\nThanks in part to the effort of Phog Allen—a Kansas Jayhawks collegiate coach—the first Olympic basketball tournament was organized in the 1936 Berlin Olympics on outdoor tennis courts. Dr. Naismith presented the medals to the top three teams. According to the Olympic rules of that time, all of the competitors were amateurs. The tournament was held indoors for the first time in 1948. The American team proved its dominance, winning the first seven Olympic tournaments through 1968, without losing a single game. While the Americans were barred from sending a team that contained players from the professional National Basketball Association, they instead sent in college players; teams from some other countries sent in their best players, as some of their players were classified as \"amateur\" by FIBA, by earning allowances instead of wages.\nMunich and after.\nThe U.S. winning streak ended in 1972 in one of the most controversial matches in history, when the Soviet Union beat them in the gold-medal game by one point.\nThe U.S. team reclaimed the gold medal in 1976, with Yugoslavia, which had beaten the Soviet Union in the semifinal, finishing runner-up for the second time. In 1980, with the Americans' absence due to the boycott, Yugoslavia became the third team to win the title, after beating the Soviets anew in the semifinals and Italy in the final. The Americans regained the title in 1984, by beating Spain in the final, with the Soviets boycotting this time. The Soviets won the gold medal for the second time in 1988, after beating the U.S. team for the second time in the semifinal, and the Yugoslavs in the gold medal game.\nProfessional era: renewed American dominance.\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally listed in the military, but all of whom were in fact paid by the state to train full-time. In April 1989, through the leadership of Secretary General Borislav Stanković, FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments, including the Olympics. In the 1992 Summer Olympics, the U.S. \"Dream Team\" won the gold medal with an average winning margin of 44 points per game, and without calling a timeout. By this time, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed, but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces. Two newly independent countries of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, Croatia and Lithuania, won the silver and bronze medals respectively.\nThe American team repeated its victory in 1996 and 2000, but its performance was not as dominant as in 1992. Since active NBA players have been allowed to compete in the Summer Olympics, the 1996 Games in Atlanta is the only instance where the Olympic host city also had a home NBA team — the Hawks. Yugoslavia was the runner-up in Atlanta, and France in Sydney, with Lithuania winning bronze again on both occasions.\nThe renewed dominance of the U.S. was interrupted in 2004, when the Americans barely made it to the semifinal, after losing to Puerto Rico and Lithuania in the preliminaries; Argentina defeated them in the semifinals, on their way to a gold medal finish, where they beat Italy in the final, and became the fourth team to win the Olympic title.\nThe Americans regrouped in 2008, beating the reigning FIBA world champions, Spain, in an intense gold medal game, with the Argentines beating the Lithuanians in the bronze medal game. The Americans and the Spaniards met again in the 2012 gold medal game, with the U.S. again winning, although with the closest winning margin for the American team. The U.S. won again in 2016, defeating the Serbians in the gold medal game, a rematch of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final, after eliminating the Spaniards, who settled for bronze. The team defended their title by winning again in the 2020 game in Tokyo, extending their run to four consecutive gold medal finishes, and seven out of the last eight tournaments.\nWomen.\nThe first women's tournament was staged in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The Soviet Union won five straight games, becoming the inaugural champion. The next two tournaments followed the six-team round-robin format, with the Soviets defending their title in 1980 amid the U.S.-led boycott, and the U.S. winning in 1984, against the South Koreans, amid the Soviet-led boycott. In 1988, the tournament expanded into eight teams, with the Americans beating Yugoslavia in the gold medal game. In 1992, the Unified Team, consisting of the former Soviet republics, defeated China in the gold medal game. In 1996, the tournament settled into its current 12-team format; the U.S. has swept all of the tournaments since then, winning 48 consecutive games.\nVenues.\nAll venues were indoor stadiums except for the 1936 tournament, which was held outdoors on lawn tennis courts.\nQualifying.\nAs of 2012, the qualifying process consists of three stages:\nAdditionally, the teams of the host nation qualify automatically.\nIn 2020, the men's tournament will have a new qualification system. After the 2019 FIBA World Cup, seven teams will qualify directly: the top two European and American teams, and the top team from Africa, Asia and Oceania. The next 16 best teams from the FIBA World Cup will join the two teams from each continent at the Olympic qualifiers. It will feature four groups of six teams, where the best team of each group will get the remaining spots at the Olympics. The continental championships will no longer be used for Olympic qualifying.\nMen.\nPerformance by confederation.\nThis is a summary of the best performances of each confederation in each tournament.\nWomen.\nPerformance by confederation.\nThis is a summary of the best performances of each confederation in each tournament.\nTotal medal table.\nSources:\nWin–loss records.\nMen's tournament.\n\"As of 8 August 2021\"\nWomen's tournament.\n\"As of 8 August 2021\"\nRecords.\n\"As of 1 May 2018.\"\nTop career scorers.\nThe International Olympic Committee does not recognize records for basketball, although FIBA does.\nMen.\n\"As of 8 August 2021\""

        "text": "Group 20 is a rugby league competition in the region of Griffith, New South Wales, Australia. The competition is played in six grades, with these being Under 16s, Under 18s, Women's League-Tag, Women's Tackle, Reserve Grade and First Grade.\nCurrently, a home and away season consisting of eighteen rounds is played. The best five teams then play-off according to the McIntyre system, culminating in the Group 20 Grand Final, which is traditionally held at E.W. Moore Oval in Griffith, currently known as Solar Mad Stadium for sponsorship purposes.\nThe defending premiers are the Leeton Greenies, who won their eighth title in 2023 after finishing the regular season in second place.\nHistory.\nGroup 20 was established in 1954, as the Wagga Wagga district competition, after many of those clubs left Group 9 and Group 13.\nGriffith teams, and others based in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, previously played in both Group 17 and Group 9, prior to various rezonings and redistributions as the code's popularity grew throughout the first half of the 20th century.\nThe competition initially featured the Griffith, Wagga Kangaroos, Wagga Magpies, Leeton, Narrandera, Yanco, Wamoon, Yenda, Batlow, Tumbarumba, Barellan and Turvey Park clubs.\nMurrumbidgee Rugby League.\nIn 1966, the rebel Murrumbidgee Rugby League broke away from the Country Rugby League, leading to four years of reshuffled boundaries from 1967 to 1970. New competitions formed were the Murrumbidgee Rugby League, Group 8/9, Group 9/20 and Riverina Zone 3. Temora and West Wyalong joined from Group 9 during this period, leading to the 9/20 name, while other Group 20 clubs played in either that competition or Riverina Zone 3.\nThe dispute was settled in 1971, and Temora, West Wyalong and Barmedman were added to Group 20, whilst the three Wagga Wagga clubs joined Group 9 and Tumbarumba and Batlow joined Group 13. Barellan also left for Group 17 in 1973.\nRecent History.\nThe Darlington Point-Coleambally club won four premierships in the 1980s, with these titles coming in 1980, 1983, 1987 and 1988.\nThe 1990s were dominated by the Yanco-Wamoon club, who won five consecutive premierships from 1992-1996, including three consecutive victories over the Griffith Waratahs club.\nAfter being a founding member of the league and winning three premierships in 1986, 1991, and 1999, the Narrandera Lizards club were in recess in the 2000, 2002 seasons, spent 2001 in Group 17, rejoined Group 20 in 2003 and 2004 and again went into recess from 2005 till 2011. Narrandera and Yanco-Wamoon briefly merged to form the Bidgee Hurricanes from 2012 to 2014, although the merger collapsed in 2015 and Yanco-Wamoon emerged as a standalone club. Narrandera then re-formed again and moved to the Western Riverina Community Cup in 2018.\nYenda became the first Group 20 side to win the prestigious Clayton Cup as the best team in the state in 2009, when they won their sixth premiership of the decade.\nCurrent clubs.\nAs of 2023, there are eight clubs in the First Grade competition, three of which are located in the City of Griffith where the competition is based (the Griffith Waratah Tigers, who withdrew from all senior competitions in 2023, still compete in the junior competitions).

        "title": "Rugby league gameplay",
        "text": "Like most forms of modern football, rugby league football is played outdoors on a rectangular grass field with goals at each end that are attacked and defended by two opposing teams. The rules of rugby league have changed significantly over the decades since rugby football split into the league and union codes. This article details the modern form of the game and how it is generally played today, although rules do vary slightly between specific competitions.\nBasics.\nField.\nA game of rugby league consists of two forty-minute halves, played by two teams on a rectangular grass field 120 metres long and 58–68 metres wide, depending on the individual ground. In the middle of the field is the 50-metre \"halfway\" line. Each side of the field, on either side of the 50-metre line, is identical. 10 metres from the 50-metre line is the 40-metre line, followed by the 30, 20, 10-metre and goal or \"try\" lines. This makes up 100 metres of field that is used for general play.\nAt the middle of each goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter \"H\", used for point scoring from kicks (drop goals, penalty goals, and conversions). Six to twelve metres beyond each goal-line is the dead ball line. The area between these two lines is called the in-goal area, and varies from field to field.\nThe dead ball lines and the touch-lines (side lines) make up the boundary of the field of play. If the ball (or any part of the body of a player in possession of the ball) touches the ground on or beyond any of these lines, the ball is said to be \"dead\", and play must be restarted. This is done by one of two ways. If the ball goes dead, play restarts at the 20 metre line closer to where it went dead. If it goes into touch, a scrum is played.\nPlayers.\nAll rugby league players must be particularly physically fit and tough because of the game's fast pace and the expansive size of the playing-field as well as the inherently rough physical contact involved. Depending on his exact role or position, a player's size, strength and/or speed can provide different advantages (or disadvantages). Effective teamwork is also extremely important.\nMode of play.\nAfter a coin toss with the two captains and referee, the winner elects either to kick off or to receive the kick off and chooses which end of the field to attack for the first half. The ends change over after the half-time break.\nPlay commences once the ball has been kicked off from the ground in the centre of the field by one team to the other. The longer and higher the kick, the more advantageous, as this forces the team receiving the ball to return it from deeper within their own territory. If a long or misdirected kick goes out of the field of play without first bouncing, a penalty is awarded to the non-kicking team from the halfway line, but if a kicked ball lands in the field of play and then bounces out, the kicking team receives possession at the point of entry. A short kick off may be employed to regain possession, but it must travel at least beyond the 10 metre line; they are usually attempted towards the end of closely fought matches when time is scarce and points are needed.\nEach team is responsible for defending their end of the field, and they take turns throughout a game at defending and attacking. At half-time (the 40th minute of the game), the teams have a 10-minute break, then swap ends before resuming play.\nThe team with possession of the football is the team in attack. The primary aim of this team is to \"work\" the ball out from their own end of the field, into a more favourable position towards the opposition's end, and score a try by grounding the ball in the opposition's in-goal area or on the goal line. In some circumstances, the team in attack may opt to kick a one-point drop goal instead of attempting to score a try. Scoring will at least involve first gaining field position and, in the case of scoring a try, will almost certainly involve breaking the opposition's defensive line.\nThe objective of the defensive side is to prevent the team in possession from scoring and obtaining their shorter term objectives. The defensive team carries out these objectives by:\nFavourable field position is an important aim in rugby league, a goal present in the minds of players at almost all times. Possession of the ball is the primary aim of each team. When in possession the aim is to maintain possession and score by running in packs and trying to minimise ball-handling errors and penalties conceded (which always result in a changeover of possession). When not in possession the aim is to prevent the opposition from scoring, prevent or reduce the incidence of the opposition carrying the ball forward, and ultimately to gain possession of the ball.\nPoint scoring.\nThere are four ways to score in rugby league: tries, conversions, penalty goals, and drop goals.\nPoints scored differ from rugby union, where a try, conversion, penalty, and drop goal score 5, 2, 3, and 3 points respectively.\nPassing.\nPlayers on the team with possession may pass the ball to one another while trying to reach the opposition's end of the field. A player may only pass the ball behind himself, or pass the ball sideways parallel to the trylines. Therefore, the rest of the players on the team in possession must ensure that they are \"on-side\", and in a position to legally receive the ball by staying behind or in-line with the passer. A pass deemed to have propelled the ball forward is called a \"forward pass\" and results in an immediate halt to play. A scrum will restart play, as \"head and feed\" of the scrum will be to the team who did not make the forward pass, a forward pass normally means that possession of the ball is ceded to the opposing side. Passes are also susceptible to interception by enterprising players on the defensive team who anticipate the pass and rush up to catch it, winning possession for their team.\nTackling.\nThe defensive team tries to stop the attacking team from scoring by tackling the player with the ball as quickly as possible to prevent him gaining more ground. A tackle forces a halt in play for as long as it takes the tackled player to return to his feet and play the ball. In that time, the defending team, with the exception of two markers, must move back a minimum of 10 metres towards their end of the field. The attacking team restarts play and continues with its next chance to score via the play-the-ball. After each tackle the attacking team should be closer to their opposition's end of the field. A 2012 New Zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league. Of all the rugby league positions, averages the most tackles.\nSix tackle rule.\nSince 1972, an attacking team has a set of six chances to score, often referred to as six tackles. The referee keeps track of how many tackles have been performed in each set of six. Some referees choose to shout the number of tackles (to avoid any players' confusion as to what point in the tackle count it is); however, this is not a requirement. When a side has used five tackles, the referee signals \"fifth tackle\" by raising an arm above his head with fingers spread, indicating that five of the tackles in the set have taken place and the next tackle will be the last.\nIf a sixth tackle is made, a \"change-over\" takes place. The defending and attacking teams switch roles, and the new attacking team starts its own set of six by playing the ball at the point on the field where the last tackle was made. Usually the attacking team kicks the ball onwards after the fifth tackle in either a last-ditch attempt to score, or to force the opposition to start their next set of six tackles as far back as possible.\nAn attacking team may also have seven chances to score in a special circumstance, governed by the zero tackle rule.\nPlay-the-ball.\nPlay-the-ball is used to restart play in various instances during a game, most commonly immediately following a tackle. The act of the play-the-ball is sometimes referred to simply as \"playing the ball\". To return the ball to play correctly, the tackled player must:\nFrom the moment the ball is rolled back by the tackled player's boot, the next phase of play begins. The \"dummy half\" is the term used to refer to the player who then picks up the ball and resumes his team's attack.\nThe ruck is located between the player playing-the-ball and the defending marker. The ruck exists during the time between a tackle being completed and the subsequent play-the-ball being completed. The ball cannot be interfered with by a defending player whilst it is in the ruck, otherwise a penalty will be issued against that player's team. A penalty is also issued against the attacking team if the player responsible for playing the ball, does not play it correctly. Many penalties in rugby league occur in and around the ruck.\nPart way though the 2020 seasons in both Australia and Europe penalties for defensive infringements at the ruck were replaced by the \"six again\" rule which gives the attacking team an immediate new set of six tackles.\nOffside.\nFollowing a completed tackle, all but two of the defending team (the markers) must retreat at least ten metres from the point at which the tackle is made. This distance is marked by the referee. Following the play-the-ball, defenders are permitted to advance to try to put pressure on the attackers and to reduce the distance they can make with the ball. If a defender who has failed to retreat 10 metres interferes with play, then he will be deemed to have been offside and this will result in a penalty to the attacking team. Equally, if a defender advances too quickly before the ball is played, then this will also result in a penalty to the attackers. When a player kicks the ball, his teammates must be behind him, or they will be called for offside if they interfere with the play.\nMarkers.\nDuring the play-the-ball it is customary for a player from the defending team, called a marker, to stand directly in front of the player playing the ball. If no marker is present, the tackled player may \"tap\" the ball on his boot to start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually the person who tackled the player becomes a marker because he is the closest to the tackled player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second standing behind the first.\nThe marker(s) must stand directly in front of the tackled player; not doing so will result in a penalty. A marker must also not move towards the ball until the play-the-ball has been completed, otherwise he will be penalised.\nMiscellaneous rules.\nKnock on.\nIf the ball is dropped forwards by an attacker and hits the ground or another player, this constitutes a knock on and possession will be turned over. If the ball is dropped in a backwards motion, it will not be ruled as a knock-on. Equally, if a player fumbles the ball but manages to regather it before it hits the ground or another player then play will be allowed to continue. This rule does not apply if a player is performing a drop-kick.\nZero tackle rule.\nIf the defending team knocks on or touches the ball when it is in the air, and the ball is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the tackle count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero tackle rule because the next tackle is counted as 'tackle zero' and not the usual 'tackle one'. The zero tackle rule cannot be used in a set that was started by the zero tackle rule. On awarding the zero tackle rule, the referee will shout \"Back to zero!\" or \"Six again\", and wave one arm over his head with fingers clenched into a fist, indicating the attacking side's next tackle is tackle zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is tackled does not register on the tackle count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being tackled then this does not apply.\nScrum.\nThe scrum is formed by the front row forwards of each side locking together, and packing down to push against each other. The second row forwards pack in behind the front rows, and each team's loose forward joins the scrum at the back. The ball is fed through the legs of one of the props by the halfback, who normally then retrieves it from the back of the scrum.\nThe scrum was traditionally used as a mechanism where the two teams competed for possession of the ball. This has since changed with the introduction of fair, but uncontested scrums, where the ball is fed into the second row, instead of the front row, all but eliminating an effective competition for the ball. Because of these changes the scrum serves to simply remove the forwards from the play for a period, thus creating more space for the backs to attack the depleted defensive line. This is intended to give advantage to the side that is awarded the scrum. It is very rare for a team to win possession of the ball, despite not having the feed, though in such situations the referee may restart the scrum.\nA scrum can be awarded following a forward pass, knock on or the ball going over the sideline and into \"touch\".\n40–20 kick.\nThe \"40–20 rule\" was introduced by the ARL in Australia in 1997 to further reward accurate kicking in general play. It has since been adopted in Britain as well, at all levels. A 40–20 kick must be both accurate and long. For a successful 40–20: \nThe team that kicked is awarded a tap-kick restart from the point that the ball left the field. Before the 40–20 rule, the non-kicking team would have otherwise been awarded the scrum feed. Until recent years, a successful 40-20 kick resulted in a scrum for the kicking team. This was changed and now the attacking team is awarded a tap restart in line from where the ball went out of bounds.\n20–40 kick.\nThe \"20–40 rule\" was introduced by the NRL in Australia in 2020 and the Super League in 2021 to further reward accurate kicking in general play. A 20–40 kick must be both accurate and long. For a successful 20–40: \nThe team that kicked is awarded a tap-kick restart from the point that the ball left the field. Before the 20–40 rule, the non-kicking team would have otherwise been awarded the scrum feed.\nGoal-line drop-outs.\nIf the player in possession of the ball is tackled behind his own goal line, plays the ball over his own dead-ball line, or grounds the ball in his own in-goal area, his team is obliged to perform a drop-kick from between their own goal posts. This kick must travel over the 10-metre line before it is touched by either team. The goal line drop-out usually gives possession back to the opposing team.\nThe drop-kicking team might attempt to gain possession by executing a short kick and have their players attempt to reach the ball before the other team does; but this carries the risk that the other team could gain possession very close to the try-line. The drop-kicking team might also attempt to gain possession by kicking the ball so that it bounces before going into touch; in that event they would be awarded head and feed at the resulting scrum.\nDisciplinary sanctions.\nThe standard disciplinary sanction in rugby league is the penalty. The referee may also award a penalty try, which is described in the section on scoring.\nIf a team that has been penalised commits another offence (often by expressing dissent against the referee's decision), the referee may advance the position of the penalty 10 metres towards the offending team's goal line, and may also sin bin (temporary expulsion) or send off (permanent expulsion) the offending player(s). A rarely known law of Rugby League however is that a player may receive multiple yellow cards in a game and not receive a red card. The maximum possible number of yellows therefore are 7 yellow cards in a game for one player over different scenarios. Generally however two yellow card offences for the same reason will equal a red card even though it is not written into the laws of the game.\nIn the United Kingdom, the referee uses penalty cards to signal a sin-binning (yellow card) and a sending-off (red card). In games played in the southern hemisphere, the referee raises both arms straight out with fingers spread (to indicate 10 minutes) for a temporary expulsion and simply points sent-off players from the field of play.\nTactics.\nThe defensive team and attacking team carry out any number of tactics, within the rules, to achieve their short term and ultimately long-term objectives. The tactics below are a basic guide to how the game is typically played. On occasions, enterprising teams may choose to deviate from the typical tactics to surprise their opponents.\nAttacking tactics.\nImproving field position.\nField position is crucial in rugby league.\nBall running.\nUsually when inside their own half of the field, an attacking team will use low-risk plays to attempt to gain metres while avoiding turning over possession.\nHit-up\nAlso known as a \"drive\", this is the act of taking a pass from the dummy half and running straight into the opposition's defensive line without looking to pass. Hit-ups are usually employed to gain low-risk metres early in the tackle-count, but a good hit-up can also result in a breach of the defensive line. It also tires defenders, who have to stop an on-rushing opponent by putting their bodies on the line. Defending players may be drawn in towards the player hitting the ball up in an effort to make a tackle, possibly leaving other parts of the defensive line weakened for other attackers should the ball-carrier manage to off-load the ball to a teammate. Forwards are usually used for taking hit-ups because of their greater size (often over 100 kg) and strength, although most players on a team will take some hit-ups during a match. Most sets of 6 usually involve at least one hit-up to build a position from which to attack. A set of five hit-ups and a kick is known as \"one-out rugby\",\nDummy-half Scoot\nAn alternative to a hit-up is for the player in the dummy half (acting-halfback) position to run the ball himself, without passing. This is often performed by quicker players as they are able to round the markers and make ground for their side. Some teams use repeated dummy half scoots with the intention of playing the ball quickly and catching defenders before they are able to properly position themselves. This is known as \"quick ball\" or 'getting a roll on'.\nBreaching the defence.\nIn addition to trying to break the defensive line with the sheer force of a hit-up, players attempt to breach the opposing team's defence through combinations of plays, using speed, passing and/or kicking.\nDefensive tactics.\nWhen a side is defending they must prevent metres lost. They must defend against ball runners and kickers.\nDefending against ball running.\nPreventing line breaks.\nDefending players aim to spread across the field in a single line and stop the attacking players from breaking this line. The 'Slide Defence' and the 'Umbrella Defence' tactics aim to curb the number of breaks in the line.\nDefending against kicks.\nAn attacking side may kick the ball through or over the defensive line of players. The defence must defend against kicks in the normal field of play and in the in-goal area.\nTurning defence into attack.\nIt is commonly said that the best form of defence is attack. A defensive team in rugby league can gain possession of the ball at any stage during an attacking teams set.\nHandover.\nLate in the tackle count the attacking side will start to think defensively in anticipation of a handover, also known as a changeover or turnover. That is, whilst most kicks performed at this time will be primarily for attacking purposes, there is always a defensive element to consider. The attacking team uses these tactics to put themselves in the better defensive position when their set of six ends at the 'change over'.\nThe attacking team uses the bomb in attack, but this attack can quickly turn to defensive if the bomb is fielded by the opposition team. Therefore, there is a defensive element in deciding whether to kick a bomb. A bomb is useful defensively because even if it is fielded by the opposition, it is still useful in giving the kicking team ample time to get as close as possible to the player with the ball which allows the kicking team to prevent the opposing team from making too much ground towards their in goal area.\nAt the end of an attacking team's set of six, the attacking team may wish to kick (grubber or chip kick) the ball in to touch and give the opposition a scrum feed. This is aimed at slowing down play, which gives the players a rest and allows them to set up a good defensive position."

His total prize earnings during his 11-win streak, $30,000, is less than last place money for the PGA Tour Championship by 1992.\nThe Tam O'Shanter Open offers a then-record purse of $60,000.\n1946\nSam Snead travels to St Andrews to compete in the first post-war British Open, and is victorious, winning by four shots from Johnny Bulla and Bobby Locke.\nLloyd Mangrum wins the U.S. Open in a second playoff, after three players - Mangrum, Byron Nelson and Vic Ghezzi - all tie with 72 in the first playoff.\nThe U.S. Women's Open is instituted. Patty Berg is the first winner.\n1947\nMildred \"Babe\" Zaharias becomes the first American to win the British Ladies Amateur, at Gullane.\nGolf is televised for the first time, in a local St. Louis telecast of the U.S. Open.\nLew Worsham wins a playoff for the U.S. Open against Sam Snead. The playoff ends in controversy as Worsham asks officials to measure which ball is closest to the hole, just as Snead is about to putt. The measure proves Snead is to putt first, but he misses, and Worsham holes his putt for victory.\nAmateur Frank Stranahan finishes runner-up at both the U.S. Masters (two shots behind Jimmy Demaret), and the British Open (a shot behind Fred Daly). Leading amateur players would continue to make occasional forays onto the leaderboards of major championships (excepting the PGA, for obvious reasons) until the early 1960s, since when it has become extremely rare for an amateur to finish in the top-ten.\nJim Ferrier becomes the first Australian to win a major championship, when he defeats Chick Harbert 2 and 1 in the final of the PGA Championship.\n\"Golf World\" magazine is founded.\n1948\nHenry Cotton wins his third British Open, at the age of 41.\nBen Hogan wins eleven tournaments during the season, including both the U.S. Open and PGA Championships.\nClub professional Claude Harmon - invited after finishing twentieth in the previous year's U.S. Open - wins the Masters championship.\nBobby Locke sets a PGA Tour record with a 16-stroke winning margin in the Chicago Victory National Championship.\nHerbert Warren Wind's authoritative \"The Story of American Golf\" is published.\nThe U.S. Junior Amateur is instituted. Ken Venturi loses to Dean Lind in the first final.\nThe \"USGA Golf Journal\" is founded.\n1949\nIn February, Ben Hogan is involved in a terrible car accident that nearly kills him, and leaves him unable to walk, let alone play golf, for the whole season.

The following week, the team stay in England to accept invites to the News of the World Match Play; here, however, they are unable to take the trophy, for although Lloyd Mangrum reaches the semi-final, the eventual winner is Welshman Dai Rees.\n1950s.\n1950\nThe LPGA is founded, replacing the ailing Women's Professional Golf Association.\nBen Hogan, only weeks after returning to the PGA Tour following a near-fatal auto accident, wins the U.S. Open at Merion.\n1951\nFrancis Ouimet becomes the first American Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.\nThe USGA and the R &amp; A, in a conference, complete a newly revised Rules of Golf. Although in 1951 the R &amp; A and the USGA continue to differ over the size of the golf ball, all other conflicts are resolved in this momentous conference. The center-shafted putter is legalized worldwide. The out-of-bounds penalty is standardized at stroke-and-distance, and the stymie is finally and forever abolished.\n\"Golf Digest\" is founded, with Bill Davis as editor.\nOn February 10, Al Brosch became the first PGA player to shoot a round of 11 under par. Brosch set the record in the third round of the Texas Open at Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio, Texas.\nDespite competing in only 5 events in a playing schedule severely curtailed following his car crash, Ben Hogan finishes fourth on the U.S. Tour money list. From his five starts, Hogan wins the Masters, the U.S. Open and the World Championship of Golf. He finishes 2nd and 4th in his other two events - the Seminole Pro-Am and the Colonial Invitational.\n1952\nMarlene Hagge wins the Sarasota Open when she is 18 years 14 days old—an LPGA record.\nPatty Berg shoots an LPGA-record of 64 for an 18-hole round.\nThe National Hole-in-One Clearing House is established by \"Golf Digest\".\n1953\nTommy Armour's \"How to Play Your Best Golf All the Time\" is published and becomes the first golf book ever to hit the best-seller lists.\nBen Hogan wins the first three legs of the modern Grand Slam (The Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open), but does not compete in the final leg, the PGA Championship.\nThe Tam O'Shanter World Championship becomes the first tournament to be nationally televised. Lew Worsham holes a 104-yard (95 m) wedge shot on the final hole for eagle and victory in one of the most dramatic finishes ever.\nThe Canada Cup is instituted, the first event that brings together teams from all over the world. After 1966 the tournament is known as the World Cup. The inaugural tournament is won by Argentina, whose two-man team of Roberto De Vicenzo and Antonio Cerdá beats a 9-team field that includes a United States team of Julius Boros and Jim Turnesa. Within a couple of years, more than 30 nations are represented at the event, which becomes one of the most important fixtures on golf's calendar.\n1954\nSam Snead defeats Ben Hogan 70–71 in a playoff for the U.S. Masters\nPeter Thomson wins the British Open, the first of five victories he will achieve in the event.\nArchitect Robert Trent Jones, upon receiving complaints that he has made the par-3 fourth hole at Baltusrol too hard for the upcoming U.S. Open, plays the hole to see for himself and records a hole-in-one.\nThe U.S. Open is nationally televised for the first time.\nThe Tam O'Shanter World Championship offers the first $100,000 purse for a golf tournament. Bob Toski wins the $50,000 first prize. Toski's three other tournament victories on the PGA Tour this year earn him a total of $8,000.\n\"All-Star Golf,\" a filmed series of matches, debuts on network television.\nBabe Zaharias returns to the LPGA Tour following cancer surgery and wins the U.S. Women's Open.\nThe first PGA Merchandise Show is held in a parking lot in Dunedin, Florida, outside the PGA National Golf Club. Salesmen work the show out of the trunks of their cars. The Show goes on to become one of the main events on the golfing calendar—by 1994 it grows to over 30,000 attendees, four days, and has become the single largest tenant of the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, spilling over 220,000 square feet (20,000 m2) of exhibit space.\n1955\nBen Hogan, chasing a record fifth U.S. Open title, surprisingly loses a playoff to rookie Jack Fleck.\nOn February 17, Mike Souchak began one of the most spectacular four-day performances in PGA history with a round of 60. In winning the Texas Open at the Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio, Texas, three days later Souchak set a 72-hole record by finishing 27 under par. His rounds of 60–68–64–65 resulted in a total of 257.

With his victory, Palmer completes the first two legs of the modern Grand Slam after winning The Masters in April, the first player to win both since Ben Hogan in 1953. He goes on to finish second to Australian Kel Nagle in the British Open to end his bid for the Grand Slam. Palmer's entry in the British Open is credited with reviving American interest in the championship, which had rarely attracted America's leading players since World War Two.

It is the first and only time this feat has been accomplished.\nTony Lema, the colorful U.S. professional, wins the British Open at St Andrews. It would be Lema's greatest triumph before he was killed in an air crash in 1966, aged just 32.\nMark McCormack establishes the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship at Wentworth, which brings together the year's four major winners, and other invited leading players of the year from the British and American tours.

On the final day, Thomson overtook Tony Lema, Bruce Devlin and Arnold Palmer to win.\nDave Marr wins the PGA Championship, by two shots from Jack Nicklaus and Billy Casper. Although Marr would never win another major title as a player, he would go on to become one of the most popular and well-respected TV commentators on the game.\nMrs. William Jenkins Sr. of Baltimore, Maryland, double-eagles the par-five 12th hole at Longview GC, the longest ever recorded by a woman.\nOn October 7, 1965, a wind gust helped golfer Robert Mitera sink history's longest hole-in-one, a ace of the 10th hole at Omaha's Miracle Hill Golf Club.\nPGA Tour Qualifying School is inaugurated at PGA National, with 17 golfers of the 49 applicants winning their playing cards.\n1966\nArnold Palmer blows a six-shot lead in the final round of the U.S. Open, dropping back into a playoff, which he loses, to a surging Billy Casper at Olympic. Although he remained one of the world's leading players for another decade, and one of its most influential and charismatic figures for the rest of his career, Palmer would never win another major championship.\nJack Nicklaus wins his first British Open championship, to become the fourth player to complete a career \"Grand Slam\", just a year after Gary Player became the third.

The breach is eventually healed, and a Tournament Players Division of the PGA is formed. Joe Dey is elected the next year as the first PGA Tour commissioner.\nRoberto De Vicenzo \"ties\" Bob Goalby after regulation play in The Masters, but signs an incorrect scorecard (that showed him having scored a 4 on the 17th hole instead of the 3 he actually took) and so loses the event by that stroke without a playoff. The sad decision is announced to incredulous spectators only after officials and tournament advisors including Bobby Jones do everything they can to scour the rulebook for a possible loophole.\nCanada wins the World Cup of Golf—the event previously known as the Canada Cup, which they never won—in Italy. Their 2-man team of Al Balding and George Knudson beat U.S. team Lee Trevino and Julius Boros by two shots. \nTommy Moore, age 6 years 1 month, 1 week, becomes the youngest player to score a hole-in-one.

As of 2009, he is the last European to win this event.\nJack Nicklaus wins a playoff against Doug Sanders to win the British Open at St Andrews.

He becomes the first player to win the U.S and British Opens in the same year since Ben Hogan in 1953. His British Open victory comes after a final-round duel with immediate crowd favourite Lu Liang-Huan, from Taiwan - \"Mr. Lu\" - the first time any Asian golfer had finished in the top three of a major tournament.\nJack Nicklaus wins the PGA Championship - unusually played in February in 1971 - but then surprisingly loses the Masters, beaten in the final round by unheralded playing partner Charles Coody.

Nicklaus was also the holder of the 1971 PGA Championship, and so would have become the first golfer to hold all four titles at the same time, although not the first to win four consecutive professional majors. Trevino's one-shot victory at Muirfield comes after he holes seemingly impossible chip shots from off the green at both the 16th and 18th holes in the third round, and then again at the 17th in the final round - snatching the tournament from under the nose of playing partner and home favourite Tony Jacklin, who is so stunned he proceeds to three-putt the 17th from then bogey the last as well, to miss out on even second place. The young Jacklin would never again challenge seriously in a major championship.\n1973\nBen Crenshaw wins the NCAA title for a record 3rd consecutive time.

(The graphite shaft was introduced to the game in 1969, as invented by Frank Thomas in 1968.)\nJack Nicklaus wins the PGA Championship and breaks Bobby Jones' record for most major victories with his 14th.

The event is won by Jack Nicklaus, a fifth Masters victory which takes Jack clear of Arnold Palmer's record of four.\nBoth the U.S. Open and the British Open are characterized by well-known third-round leaders suffering poor final rounds to allow relatively unknown players to pass them and win. At Medinah, Frank Beard gives away a three-shot overnight lead, and Lou Graham emerges victorious; at Carnoustie, South Africa's Bobby Cole — winner of the individual and team titles at the previous year's World Cup — is the victim, allowing Tom Watson to slip past for his first major victory.\nLee Trevino, Jerry Heard and Bobby Nichols are struck by lightning during the 1975 Western Open. The incident prompts new safety standards in weather preparedness at PGA Tour events, but one spectator is killed when struck by lightning during the 1991 U.S. Open at Hazeltine National, and one at the PGA Championship at Crooked Stick later that summer.\n1976\nNerveless rookie Jerry Pate wins the U.S. Open championship, firing a spectacular approach shot over a lake to within two feet at the final hole, after playing partner John Mahaffey had hit into the water attempting the same feat.\nJudy Rankin becomes the first LPGA professional to earn more than $100,000 in a season.\nRichard Stanwood sets the record for fewest putts in one round—15—at Riverside GC in Pocatello, Idaho.\nThe USGA institutes the Overall Distance Standard—golf balls that fly more than 280 yards (256 m) during a standard test are banned.\n1977\nAl Geiberger shoots 59 at Colonial CC in the second round of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic, to set a new PGA Tour 18-hole record.\nBing Crosby dies after completing a round of golf in Spain.

Runner-up Nicklaus finished ten shots clear of third place.\nChako Higuchi of Japan wins the LPGA Championship, making her the first Asian-born golfer to win a major championship.\n1978\nThe Legends of Golf is inaugurated at Onion Creek C.C. in Austin, Texas. Its popularity leads to the formation of the Senior PGA Tour two years later.\nGary Player, aged 43, wins the Masters championship for his ninth major title. As if not to be upstaged, later in the year Jack Nicklaus wins a third British Open title, taking his career total to fifteen. \nJohn Mahaffey wins the PGA Championship in a playoff, after Tom Watson lets slip a five-shot lead during the final day. Watson, an eight-time major champion, would never win a PGA Championship to complete the career Grand Slam.\nThe ever-growing LPGA Tour finds a new superstar to make headlines that surpass even those from the men's game, as Nancy Lopez, in her rookie season, wins five events in a row among nine victories in all. \n1979\nThe Ryder Cup is reformatted to add European continent players to the British and Irish side, making the event far more competitive. The move is prompted in no small part by the rise of golfers such as Seve Ballesteros. As if to emphasise the need for change, Ballesteros — already known simply as \"Sevvy\" to an adoring British public — wins the British Open at Lytham St Annes, becoming the first Spanish golfer to win a major, and the first from Continental Europe to win a major since Frenchman Arnaud Massy in 1907.\nThe United States Golf Association opens the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women's Amateur to golfers not affiliated with private clubs.\nTaylor Made introduces the first metal woods.\nThe USGA forms the Handicap Research Team which results in the creation of what is now the Slope rating system.\nEd Sneed bogeys each of the last three holes to lose a three-shot lead at the Masters, and drop back into a playoff which is then won by Fuzzy Zoeller.\n1980s.\n1980\nTom Watson is the first golfer to earn $500,000 in prize money in a single season.\nThe Senior PGA Tour is born, with four official events. The U.S. Senior Open is instituted. Roberto De Vicenzo is the first winner.\nJack Nicklaus sets a record of 272 in the U.S. Open at Baltusrol. His mark is equalled in the 1993 U.S. Open by Lee Janzen, also at Baltusrol, and later by Tiger Woods in 2000 at Pebble Beach and Jim Furyk in 2003 at Olympia Fields. Isao Aoki finishes second, the highest finish by a Japanese golfer at a major championship.\nThe USGA introduces the Symmetry Standard, banning balls such as the Polaris which correct themselves in flight.\nGary Wright completes 18 holes in a record 28 minutes 9 seconds at Twantin Noosa GC, Australia 6,039 yards (5,522 m).\n1981\nThe Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass opens, with its controversial island green 17th hole, and immediately becomes the permanent host of the Tournament Players Championship.

A month later, Watson wins his fourth British Open title, in a tournament that will be remembered for the collapse of young American Bobby Clampett. Virtually unknown (certainly to British fans) going into the event, Clampett began 67–66 to open up a 5-shot halfway lead. Still the leader after three rounds, he shot a sorry 77 in the final round to finish well down the field. Watson narrowly misses out on a fifth U.S. Money List crown in six years, as that honour goes to the fiery Craig Stadler, who wins the U.S. Masters in his finest season.\n1983\nThe PGA Tour introduces the 'all-exempt' Tour, with the top 125 players from the 1982 money list exempt from weekly qualifying for tournaments, as opposed to the top 60 as before. A record 34 different players win tournaments, and no-one is able to win more than twice. One who does win twice is 25-year-old Hal Sutton, 1982's rookie of the year, who becomes Player of the Year with victories in the Tournament Players Championship and PGA Championship. Isao Aoki becomes the first Japanese golfer to win on the U.S. Tour, with victory in the Hawaiian Open.

Watson almost retains his U.S. Open crown as well, but loses by a shot to Larry Nelson, who holes a downhill putt on Oakmont's 16th green on his way to victory.\n1984\nDesert Highlands opens in Phoenix from a design by Jack Nicklaus utilizing only irrigated for 18 holes, instead of the typical 100–150 for a major course. The success of Nicklaus' concept of \"target golf\" ushers in the era of environmentally sensitive desert design.\nBen Crenshaw, after five second-place finishes in Major championships, finally wins one, as he beats his long-time friend Tom Kite to take his first U.S. Masters title.\nSeve Ballesteros defeats Tom Watson in one of the most dramatic finishes ever at the British Open at St Andrews. As Ballesteros birdied the final hole to a huge roar from his adopted \"home\" fans, Watson pushed his approach at the famous 17th \"Road Hole\" through the green and against a wall, dropping a crucial shot.\nAt the age of 44, Lee Trevino wins a sixth major championship, the PGA Championship. It is ten years since his last one. 48-year-old Gary Player is runner-up.\n1985\nNancy Lopez sets the LPGA 72-hole record with 268 in the Henredon Classic.\nBernhard Langer becomes the first German golfer to win a Major Championship, when he wins the U.S. Masters.

Later in the year, Hubert Green, like North without a victory for several years, also won his second major title, at the PGA Championship.\nCalvin Peete wins the Tournament Players Championship with a course record 72-hole score of 274. Although not a major championship, this is the most significant tour victory to this date by a black golfer.\nThe $1m Alfred Dunhill Cup at St Andrews is inaugurated, a three-man matchplay competition that aims to replace the World Cup of Golf — a largely ignored event for several years now - as the premier international team event.

His final-day charge takes him past virtually all of the leading players of the generation below him, including Greg Norman, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Watson and Tom Kite. In June, Raymond Floyd also rolls back the years to win the U.S. Open, aged 44.\nThe Sony Rankings system, now the Official World Golf Rankings, is introduced, the first formally recognised ranking system for men's golf. The first-ever number one, in April 1986, is 1985 Masters Champion Bernhard Langer. \nBob Tway sinks a bunker shot at the final hole to beat Greg Norman in the PGA Championship. Norman had held the lead on Sunday morning in each of the four major championships of 1986, but was able to win only the British Open. Tway's stroke began a celebrated series of miracle shots holed by various golfers to defeat Norman in major events.\nThe Pete Dye-designed PGA West opens amid great controversy concerning the difficulty of the course.\nThe Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational offers the first $1 million purse on the PGA Tour.

Norman, a 10-time winner around the globe in 1986, would not win again on the U.S. Tour for over twelve months.\nAt the British Open, Nick Faldo plays a flawless last round of 18 consecutive pars to win his first major championship. The victory rewarded Faldo's efforts to completely re-model his swing, that had seen him virtually leave the Tour for two years.\nLarry Nelson wins his third major championship in six years, defeating Lanny Wadkins in a playoff for the PGA Championship. The victory means that three of Nelson's nine career U.S.Tour wins to date have come in majors.\nEurope win the Ryder Cup on American soil for the first time, and rub salt into the wounds by defeating an American team captained by Jack Nicklaus, at the Muirfield Village course which Nicklaus designed. The result provides final confirmation of the recent swing in global dominance away from the American players; at the end of 1987, only one of the world's top six (Curtis Strange, in 5th) is American, while four (Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle and Ian Woosnam) are European, while the world number one remains Greg Norman. \nThe Nabisco Championships (later The Tour Championship) debuts as a season-ending event for the top 30 money winners.

The PGA Tour also bans the clubs in 1989. Karsten Manufacturing, maker of the clubs, fights a costly two-year battle with both the USGA and the PGA Tour to have the ban rescinded after winning a temporary injunction. Eventually both organizations drop the ban, while Karsten acknowledges the right of the organizations to regulate equipment and pledges to make modifications to future designs.\nSandy Lyle becomes the first British player to win the U.S. Masters. Lyle sweeps his approach shot to the last green out of a fairway bunker to within , and sinks the resulting birdie putt for a one-shot victory over Mark Calcavecchia.\nSeve Ballesteros wins his third British Open championship in the first-ever Monday finish to the 72 holes, after the whole of Saturday's scheduled third round at Royal Lytham was lost to torrential rain. The victory, one of several around the globe for Ballesteros in 1988, helps him to finish the year on top of the Sony World Rankings.\nCurtis Strange wins the season-ending Nabisco Championships at Pebble Beach, and his $360,000 paycheck lifts his official 1988 Tour earnings to $1,147,644, and thus he becomes the first player to win over $1,000,000 in a single season. Earlier in the year Strange defeated Nick Faldo in a play-off for his first major title, the U.S. Open.\n1989\nFour golfers, Doug Weaver, Mark Wiebe, Jerry Pate and Nick Price, hit aces on the par-three sixth hole on the same day in the U.S. Open at Oak Hill.

Faldo goes on to win The Masters, abetted by Scott Hoch missing a short putt to win the event — a downhill effort of little more than on the first playoff hole.\nMark Calcavecchia wins the British Open in a novel 4-hole playoff format, against Australians Wayne Grady and Greg Norman. Calcavecchia hits a five-iron out of the rough at the final hole to within six feet for the winning birdie.\nPayne Stewart, noted for his flamboyant dress (plus-fours and a sponsorship deal that sees him wear the often garish colours of the nearest NFL team) wins the PGA Championship, after a late collapse by Mike Reid.\n1990s.\n1990\nHall Thompson of Shoal Creek GC, on the eve of the PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, defends his club's policy of not admitting black members. Amidst a public outcry, Shoal Creek 1990 is forced to change its policy and the PGA Tour and the USGA insist that in future all clubs submit to a standard set of guidelines on membership policies. Cypress Point Club and Aronimink, among others, decide they are unable to comply and withdraw from the professional tournament arena.\nBill Blue resigns after a short reign as LPGA Commissioner. Charles Mecham is selected as his successor.\nConstruction begins on Shadow Creek Golf Club, the most expensive golf course ever built, with cost estimates ranging from $35 to $60 million as Tom Fazio creates an oasis in the Las Vegas desert. The club in 1994 vaults into eighth place on the Golf Digest top-100 course rankings, sparking controversy.\nThe R &amp; A, after 38 years, adopts the diameter ball, and for the first time since 1910 The Rules of Golf are standardized throughout the world.\nThe initial Solheim Cup is played at Lake Nona G.C., Orlando, commencing a biennial USA vs. Europe competition for women, a recognition of the growing strength of women's golf on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe Ben Hogan Tour is launched as a minor league for the PGA Tour, following the increased success of mini-tours such as the U.S. Golf Tour in 1989.\nNick Faldo retains his U.S. Masters title, once again in a play-off (this time against Raymond Floyd). Later in the year, he adds the British Open, in a tournament that is effectively decided in the third round, where Faldo shoots a 67 while co-leader Greg Norman struggles to a 76. At the U.S. Open, however, Faldo narrowly misses out, as 45-year-old veteran Hale Irwin holes an unlikely putt at the last to edge him out by a shot. Irwin wins his third U.S. Open (eleven years after his second) following a playoff against Mike Donald.\nAustralian Wayne Grady, who lost a playoff at the British Open in 1989, bounces back to win the PGA Championship. Fred Couples, chasing too hard, misses several short putts on the back nine when apparently poised to snatch victory.\n1991\nThe Ocean Course at Kiawah Island, S.C., the first course to be awarded the Ryder Cup Matches before the course has been completed, is the scene of the United States' first victory in the event since 1983. The competition comes down to a twisting putt of seven feet (2 m) on the 18th hole missed by Bernhard Langer in the final match (against Hale Irwin).\nUnknown John Daly wins the PGA Championship at Crooked Stick when, as ninth alternate, a slot in the tournament opens up for him on the night before the Championship begins. Daly wins an army of fans overnight with his prodigious hitting from the tees and an apparently fearless approach to putting. The golfer who withdrew and gave Daly his place, Nick Price, wins the PGA Championship in 1992 at Bellerive.\nPhil Mickelson, an amateur, wins the PGA Tour's Northern Telecom Open.\nDiminutive Welshman Ian Woosnam holds off the challenges of Tom Watson and José María Olazábal to win The Masters. The win is the most important in an increasing list of tournaments that Woosnam has won around the world since 1987, and helps him to overtake Nick Faldo at the top of the World Rankings.\nAustralian Ian Baker-Finch, who was best remembered by British fans for being the 23-year-old player who had led the 1984 Open Championship after three rounds before hitting a 79 on the final day, again leads after three rounds but this time wins the British Open in comfortable style with a superb 66, against playing partner Mark O'Meara's 69. \nOversized metal woods are introduced, with Callaway Golf's Big Bertha quickly establishing itself as the dominant brand, the Big Bertha driver becomes one of the biggest-selling clubs of all time.\nHarvey Penick's \"Little Red Book\" becomes the all-time best selling golf book.\n1992\nAll three American major championships are won by players who had enjoyed successful U.S. Tour careers but had, until 1992, only been able to finish runner-up at best in the majors. First, at the Masters, Fred Couples wins after final-round battle with Raymond Floyd. Then, Tom Kite (U.S. Tour leading money-winner as long ago as 1981) emerges victorious at the U.S. Open after a windswept final round at Pebble Beach that sees many of the third-round leaders shoot high scores. And finally, Nick Price - twice a runner-up at the British Open Championship - wins the PGA Championship, the start of a period of good form that would take him to the world number one position by the end of 1994. The year's other major, the British Open, is won by Nick Faldo - his fifth major title in five years. Faldo rises to the World number one position in 1992.\nSimon Clough and Boris Janic complete 18-hole rounds in five countries in one day, walking each course. They played rounds in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, and completed their journey in 16 hours, 35 minutes.\nBrittany Andres, age 6 years 19 days, scores an ace at the 85 yard (78 m) second hole at the Jimmy Clay G.C. in Austin, Texas.\n1993\nAn ownership group led by Joe Gibbs and Arnold Palmer announce plans for The Golf Channel, a 24-hour, 365-day cable service.\nBernhard Langer wins his second U.S. Masters title, but the event is remembered for the criticism aimed by some commentators at Chip Beck for laying up short of the water at the 15th hole, apparently defending his second place rather than risking all to challenge Langer's 3-shot lead.\nGreg Norman also wins a second major title, the British Open. Playing scintillating golf, Norman's total of 267 is the lowest ever recorded in a major championship. However, the following month, Norman misses out on the PGA Championship, beaten in a sudden-death playoff by Paul Azinger. The defeat means Norman has lost playoffs in each of the four majors, a dubious honour he shares with Craig Wood, who lost playoffs in three of them and also the 1934 PGA Championship (in match play) final in extra holes. \nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1994\nNick Price enjoys a phenomenal year, leading the U.S. Money List for the second successive season and winning both the British Open and PGA Championships. His win at the British Open comes courtesy of a eagle putt at the 17th in the final round.\nGreg Norman, shoots a course-record 264 to win the Tournament Players Championship around the famed Pete Dye designed Sawgrass course.\nErnie Els wins a three-way playoff to become the second South African winner of the U.S. Open, against Colin Montgomerie and Loren Roberts. José María Olazábal becomes the second Spaniard to win the U.S. Masters, defeating third-round leader Tom Lehman by two shots. \nTiger Woods becomes the youngest man ever to win the U.S. Amateur, at age 18. Several players had previously won aged 19, including Jack Nicklaus in 1959.\nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1995\nDays after the death of his long-time friend and mentor Harvey Penick, Ben Crenshaw wins a second U.S. Masters championship with an emotional victory over Davis Love III and Greg Norman.\nNorman also narrowly misses out at the U.S. Open, finishing second for the 7th time in a major, behind Corey Pavin.\nJohn Daly proves that his 1991 PGA Championship was not a fluke, as he wins the Open Championship at St Andrews after a playoff with Italian Costantino Rocca. Rocca holes a long putt at the last to force the playoff as Daly, in the clubhouse, watches on, but Daly dominates the 4-hole playoff.\nSteve Elkington wins a sudden-death playoff to collect his first major at the PGA Championship. Colin Montgomerie loses, the second year in succession he had lost a playoff in a major (a record he shares with Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson). \nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1996\nIn one of the most astonishing final rounds in the tournament's history, Greg Norman loses a 5-shot third round lead to lose by 6, as Nick Faldo's superb 67 contrasts with Norman's dreadful 78.\nAfter a career seemingly curtailed several years previously by a motorcycle accident, Steve Jones wins the U.S. Open. Both Davis Love III and Tom Lehman finish just short of Jones. Lehman (as at the 1994 Masters and 1995 U.S. Open) leads on Saturday night but cannot hold on. At the British Open, Lehman again leads after three rounds, but this time is able to finish the job, winning his first major title. The PGA Championship also goes to a first-time major winner as Mark Brooks beats Kenny Perry in a sudden-death playoff after a two-shot swing (Perry bogeyed and Brooks birdied) at the 72nd hole.\nTiger Woods became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles. This was the sixth consecutive year in which he won a USGA championship, one short of Bobby Jones' record of seven. In September, he turned professional. He receives a number of sponsors' invitations to PGA Tour events, but is still expected by most to have to return to the qualifying school to earn a full players' card for 1997. However, in the last five regular tournaments of the year on the PGA Tour, his finishes were 5–3–1–3–1, placing him among the tour's top 30 money-winners for the year and thereby qualifying him for the season-ending The Tour Championship. Woods was named the PGA Tour's Rookie of the Year.\nAlthough unable to win a major championship, Colin Montgomerie tops both the World Money List and the World ranking points list for 1996. Greg Norman however narrowly remains the official world number one as the system takes into account points earned over a 24-month period.\nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1997\nIn his first major championship as a professional, Tiger Woods becomes the youngest-ever Masters Champion at 21 years 3 months, while setting a 72-hole scoring record of 270 (18 under par), and winning by a record margin (12 shots). He also becomes the first golfer of either Asian or African descent to win a men's major title. Woods wins three other tournaments in 1997 to top the U.S. Money list in what is effectively his rookie season. Even though Woods becomes the first player to earn more than $2m in a season, however, his earnings are surpassed by the leading player on the Senior PGA Tour, Hale Irwin, who wins 9 times.\nErnie Els wins a second U.S. Open, once again defeating Colin Montgomerie in a close finish. Tom Lehman, once again, led after three rounds, but again was unable to win the title.\n25-year-old Justin Leonard made up a 5-shot final-round deficit with a 65 to win his first major championship, the British Open, by two shots from Jesper Parnevik and Darren Clarke. A month later, Leonard finished runner-up to Davis Love III at the PGA Championship.\nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1998\nAt the age of 41, Mark O'Meara wins his first major championship, the Masters, becoming one of the few champions in history to birdie the last hole to win. Runner-up is 26-year-old David Duval who would win four times on the regular tour to lead the money list, as Tiger Woods - after his meteoric first season - wins just once. In July, O'Meara wins a second major title - this time the British Open, after a playoff with Brian Watts, an American golfer whose career had mostly been played on the Japan Golf Tour. Watts is forced to play a bunker shot at the 72nd hole with only one foot in the sand, needing a par to force the playoff, and very nearly holes the shot. The British Open is also notable for the remarkable tournament enjoyed by 18-year-old amateur Justin Rose, who finishes fourth after being in touch with the lead throughout the final round.\nLee Janzen wins a second U.S. Open title, and as in 1993, Payne Stewart finishes runner-up. Stewart's putt to tie at the last rolls across the lip but does not drop.\nFijian Vijay Singh, a regular winner on both the European and U.S. Tours since the early 1990s, wins the PGA Championship. With a round to play, both player of the season Mark O'Meara and 1997's sensation Tiger Woods are within five shots of the lead, but Singh holds on for victory. Singh, an Indian Fijian, becomes the second golfer of Asian descent to win a men's major.\nSe Ri Pak becomes the first South Korean on the LPGA Tour and makes an immediate impact, winning two majors (the LPGA Championship and U.S. Women's Open) and two other events. She proved to be only the first of a wave of Korean players on the tour; a decade after her arrival in the U.S., she was joined on the LPGA Tour by 44 other Koreans, and the tour's single biggest source of revenue was the sale of TV broadcast rights in South Korea. The season's first major was also won by a golfer of Asian descent; the Nabisco Dinah Shore was won by Pat Hurst, an American with a white father and Japanese mother.\nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf\n1999\nAfter several years suffering from a recurring foot injury that at times left him unable to walk, José María Olazábal wins a second U.S. Masters crown. Greg Norman is yet again left trailing in the victor's wake, finishing third.\nPayne Stewart wins his second U.S. Open, and third major title in all, by a shot from Phil Mickelson. In October, Stewart would be among the victims of an air accident, caused by a sudden loss of cabin pressure in their Learjet.\nIn one of the most extraordinary and ultimately farcical major championships in history, unknown local player Paul Lawrie wins the British Open championship at Carnoustie, after similarly unknown French player Jean van de Velde contrives to take a seven at the par-four final hole, when six would have won the title. The error is caused initially by a wildly pushed second shot that ricochets off the grandstand and into thick rough, from where Van de Velde chops his third shot into a burn in front of the green. Van de Velde drops back into a playoff with Lawrie and Justin Leonard, who had also previously found the burn at the 72nd hole in an attempt to put pressure on Van de Velde.\n23-year-old Tiger Woods wins his second major title, the PGA Championship, by a shot from 19-year-old Spaniard Sergio García. Despite losing, García hits the most memorable shot of the tournament, a brilliant deliberate slice from the roots of a tree that finds the green in the final round.\nDavid Duval wins four events on the U.S. Tour before the Masters, including the Tournament Players' Championship, and briefly becomes number one in the World rankings. He finishes the year second on the ranking list behind Woods. \nThe United States regain the Ryder Cup in a controversial end to the singles matches at Brookline. As Justin Leonard holes a lengthy putt in his crucial match with José María Olazábal, several U.S. players and their wives dash across the green to congratulate him, some of them across Olazábal's line, neglecting to respect the fact that the Spaniard still had a putt to win. Olazábal misses his putt, but the Europeans were aggrieved at what they perceived as a lack of sporting behavior. \nThe World Golf Championships, which bring together the leading players in the World Rankings for four events each season (one at match play, two at stroke play, and one - the revamped World Cup - a two-man team event), are inaugurated. The first event, the 64-man WGC-Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, provides a surprise champion in Jeff Maggert; Tiger Woods wins the following two. \nMen's Golf\nWomen's Golf"

        "title": "Frank Ramsey (basketball)",
        "text": "Frank Vernon Ramsey Jr. (July 13, 1931 – July 8, 2018) was an American professional basketball player and coach. A 6-3 forward/guard, he played his entire nine-year (1954–1964) NBA career with the Boston Celtics and played a major role in the early part of their dynasty, winning seven championships as part of the team. Ramsey was also a head coach for the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA during the 1970–1971 season. Ramsey was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982.\nUniversity of Kentucky.\nRaised in Madisonville, Kentucky, Ramsey was a multi-sport athlete at the University of Kentucky, playing baseball as well as basketball. Playing under legendary coach Adolph Rupp, Ramsey, as a sophomore in 1951, helped the Wildcats win the NCAA Championship with a 68–58 victory over Kansas State.\nIn the fall of 1952, a point shaving scandal involving three Kentucky players (a fourth player, Bill Spivey, a teammate of Ramsey's on the 1951 championship team, was accused of being involved in the scandal but denied the charge) over a four-year period forced Kentucky to forfeit its upcoming season, Ramsey's senior year, as well as that of Cliff Hagan and Lou Tsioropoulos. The suspension of the season made Kentucky's basketball team, in effect, the first college sports team to get the \"death penalty,\" although it was nothing more than the NCAA asking members schools not to schedule Kentucky, and not mandating it.\nRamsey, Hagan and Tsioropoulos all graduated from Kentucky in 1953 and, as a result, became eligible for the NBA draft. All three players were selected by the Boston Celtics—Ramsey in the first round, Hagan in the third, and Tsioropoulos in the seventh. All three also returned to Kentucky for one more season despite graduating. After finishing the regular season (one in which Ramsey averaged 19.6 points per game) with a perfect 25–0 record and a #1 ranking in the Associated Press, Kentucky had been offered a bid into the NCAA Tournament. However, then-existing NCAA rules prohibited graduate students from participating in post-season play; the Wildcats declined the bid because their participation would have forced them to play without Ramsey, Hagan and Tsioropoulos, thus jeopardizing their perfect season.\nRamsey also played on Kentucky Wildcats baseball team, earning All-SEC honors as an outfielder in 1951, 1952 and 1954.\nUpon completion of his college basketball career, Ramsey scored 1344 points (14.8 ppg), which at the time ranked him fourth in the school's history, and grabbed 1038 rebounds (11.4 rpg), a school record later surpassed by one of his future Kentucky Colonels players, Dan Issel.\nBoston Celtics.\nAfter playing his rookie season with the Celtics (1954–1955), Ramsey spent one year in the military before rejoining the team. In the eight seasons he played after military service, he was a member of seven championship teams (1957, 1959–1964). He was a major contributor of the Celtics dynasty, playing behind the duo of Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman and playing with Bill Russell, Sam Jones, K. C. Jones, Tom Heinsohn, John Havlicek and Satch Sanders. In his 623 NBA games Ramsey scored 8378 points for an average of 13.4 points per game. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1981. His #23 is retired by the Celtics.\nRamsey's best statistical season was 1957–1958; he averaged 16.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. It was also his only post-military season in which the Celtics did not win the NBA championship; the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks (who also featured Cliff Hagan, Ramsey's ex-college teammate) defeated them in the NBA Finals.\nBrief coaching career.\nRamsey was also a head coach for one season (1970–71) in the ABA with the Kentucky Colonels, who were led by two former Kentucky Wildcats – Issel, a rookie, and Louie Dampier. Ramsey was named coach 17 games into an 84-game season (which began with Gene Rhodes coaching the first 15 games and fellow Kentucky alum Alex Groza coaching the next two) and, though he had a 32–35 record, coached the Colonels into the playoffs. The Colonels lost to the Utah Stars (who were coached by Sharman, Ramsey's ex-Celtic teammate) in the 1971 ABA Finals, 4 games to 3. Joe Mullaney replaced Ramsey as coach the following season.\nPrior to coaching in the ABA, Ramsey had been Red Auerbach's first choice to replace his mentor as Celtics coach after Auerbach retired at the end of the 1965–66 season. However, Ramsey decided to move back to Madisonville; his father, Frank Sr., wasn't in good health and Frank Jr. had three children to raise.\nThe NBA's first sixth man.\nAuerbach is often credited throughout basketball with creating the sixth man. Though Ramsey was one of the Celtics' best players, he felt more comfortable coming off the bench and Auerbach wanted him fresh and in the lineup at the end of close games. Ramsey was the first in a series of sixth men who won championship rings with the Celtics. In the championships the Celtics won after Ramsey's retirement, they have had successful sixth men such as Havlicek, Paul Silas, Kevin McHale, Bill Walton, and James Posey.\nRamsey was mentioned in the episode \"If I Could See Me Now\" of \"Married... with Children\". Bud asked Al the trivia question, \"Who was known as the best sixth man in basketball? He played for the Celtics\", to which Al nonchalantly replied, \"Frank Ramsey\".\nPersonal life.\nOn November 15, 2005, Ramsey's house was destroyed in a tornado that hit his residence in Madisonville. One of his plaques was found miles away from his home, and Ramsey himself was found unhurt.\n, Ramsey was a bank president in Dixon, Kentucky.\nRamsey died of natural causes in his hometown of Madisonville, Kentucky on July 8, 2018, at the age of 86."

        "title": "Joe Morris (American football)",
        "text": "Joseph Edward Morris (born September 15, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants from 1982 to 1988. Initially noted for his diminutive stature — 5' 7\", Morris was a key member of the Giants team that won Super Bowl XXI in 1987. He rushed for 67 yards, caught four passes for 20 yards, and scored a touchdown in the game.\nCollege career.\nWhile playing scholastic sports at Ayer High School in Ayer, Massachusetts, Morris was an All-State in two sports. Morris was a four-year starter at Syracuse University in upstate New York. At Syracuse, Morris set all of the all-time rushing records rushing for 4,229 yards in his four seasons surpassing former greats such as Jim Brown, Larry Csonka and Floyd Little. An All-American choice by his senior year, he was selected to play in the Blue–Gray, East–West Shrine and Senior Bowl games before signing on with the New York Giants. Morris was also co-captain with Ike Bogosian, father of NHL player Zach Bogosian.\nProfessional career.\nMorris was the New York Giants' second round pick in the 1982 NFL Draft, and quickly outshined their first round pick, University of Michigan back Butch Woolfolk. As a rookie with the Giants in 1982, Morris scored a touchdown on his very first rushing attempt; a prelude of what was to come for this powerful running back. In 1985, he rushed for 1,336 yards and a league leading 21 touchdowns, and rushed for 141 yards in their 17–3 postseason win over the San Francisco 49ers. Morris was a key member of the '86 Giants Super Bowl championship team rushing his way to a 1,000 yard season. He went on to add two more 1,000 plus yard rushing seasons, moving past Alex Webster as the all-time Giants leader.\nIn the Giants' march to the Lombardi Trophy, Morris rushed for 313 yards in three playoff games including a 159-yard, two touchdown performance against the San Francisco 49ers. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in '85 and '86 seasons and also received All-NFL Honors for his performance those two years. Towards the end of the 1988 season, he totaled 1,318 attempts, 5,296 yards and 48 touchdowns for the New York Giants. He didn't play the 1989 season because of an injured foot and a dispute with the team. He sat out the 1990 season. With the Cleveland Browns in 1991, he ran for 289 yards. He was waived by the Browns in September 1992 before the season started. He finished his NFL career with 5,585 rushing yards, 111 receptions for 960 yards, and 52 touchdowns.\nGiants Franchise Records.\n's NFL off-season, Joe Morris held at least 19 Giants franchise records, most related to his prolific post-season career with the club. These records include:\nAfter football.\nMorris now works in real estate and insurance. He resides in New Jersey with his two children. He was also a part owner of the New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League, along with fellow ex-Giants Carl Banks and Harry Carson.\nFamily.\nMorris had two younger brothers follow him to Syracuse University. Mike was a wide receiver and Larry was a running back. Morris' youngest brother, Jamie Morris set the all-time rushing records at the University of Michigan."

        "title": "Earl Weaver Baseball",
        "text": "Earl Weaver Baseball is a baseball video game (1987) designed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower and published by Electronic Arts. The artificial intelligence for the computer manager was provided by Baseball Hall of Fame member Earl Weaver, then manager of the Baltimore Orioles, based on a lengthy series of interviews. \"EWB\" was a major hit, and along with \"John Madden Football\" helped pave the way for the EA Sports brand, which launched in 1992. A Sega Genesis version was planned but cancelled.\nInnovations.\n\"Earl Weaver Baseball\" is remembered for introducing many innovations to the computer sports game industry. It was the first commercial computer sports game to allow players to simulate an entire season of games without actually showing each game play-by-play on the screen. The Amiga version featured voice synthesis, a first in a sports computer game. Unlike baseball games released since, names were represented phonetically, so that even custom-created players could be announced by the synthesized voice. For the first time, different stadiums were shown graphically on the screen, with gameplay adjusted for their actual dimensions. Defunct or demolished stadiums were included, such as the Polo Grounds (New York), Griffith Stadium (Washington, D.C.), Ebbets Field (Brooklyn, New York), and Sportsman's Park (St. Louis).\n\"Earl Weaver Baseball II\".\nEarl Weaver Baseball II (EWB2) was the sequel to the classic game, and featured many advances, including the first full 3D camera that would render a television-style viewing experience. However, the game was released prematurely by Electronic Arts, and it suffered from quality and performance problems.\n\"I Got It Baseball\".\nIn 2002, Dombrower released a version of \"EWB2\" called \"I Got It Baseball\" as shareware, though in this version, the gamer can only manage, not participate. However, the managerial AI still remains, though now called \"The Skipper\". Also intact are the physics engine, the player AI, the fully developed team, player, and ballpark editors; stat accumulation, and a now-commonplace \"QuickPlay\" option. It can be downloaded at his website.\nReception.\n\"Earl Weaver Baseball\" was very successful for EA. \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1987 called the game \"undoubtedly the most exciting sports simulations to be released in years\". It praised the game's graphics and audio, and noted its extensive offensive and defensive options. In 1988 the magazine noted that \"wind, ball and player speed, and playing surface can all affect a given play's result. To offer all this and the ability to play in both strategy/action and strategy only mode is simply awesome\". Game reviewers Hartley and Patricia Lesser complimented the game in their \"The Role of Computers\" column in \"Dragon\" #126 (1987), calling it \"the finest computer simulation for baseball we’ve ever seen\" and \"impressive beyond belief\". The Lessers reviewed the IBM version of the game in the following issue (#127), and gave the game 4½ stars. They later reviewed the Commodore Amiga version in 1988 in \"Dragon\" #132, giving it 5 out of 5 stars. \"Compute!\" also praised \"Earl Weaver Baseball\", stating that the Amiga version \"is, without question, the closest we have to the ideal computer baseball game ... If you are a baseball fan, you will want this game. Period\". Jerry Pournelle wrote that \"the only problem the game has is that you'll spend half your life playing it. I know my kids have\". Recommending it to \"baseball fanatics\", he said \"you can painlessly learn more about baseball strategy from Earl Weaver Baseball than from a dozen books on the subject\". Mike Siggins reviewed \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" for \"Games International\" magazine, and gave it 5 stars out of 5, and stated that \"\"Earl Weaver Baseball\" is an excellent game offering much, much more than a stats based replay and should be a required purchase for baseball fans.\"\nAwards.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" named \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" its game of year for 1987, and in 1989 it named \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" to its Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time, with a score of 8.82 out of 12. In 1996, the magazine named \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" the 25th Best Game of All Time on the PC."

        "title": "William Alexander (American football)",
        "text": "William Anderson Alexander (June 6, 1889 – April 23, 1950) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1920 to 1944, compiling a record of 134–95–15. Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech football coach. Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have been recognized as national champions by a number of selectors. Alexander was the first college football coach to place his teams in the four major post-season bowl games of the time: Sugar, Cotton, Orange and Rose. His teams won three of the four bowls. The 1929 Rose Bowl win, which earned his team the national championship, is the most celebrated because of the wrong-way run by California's Roy Riegels. Alexander was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech for four seasons from 1919 to 1924. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.\nPlayer.\nAlexander played football under John Heisman and was appointed captain of the \"scrubs.\" In his senior year he played in the Georgia and Clemson games long enough to win a letter. Alexander graduated from Georgia Tech in 1912 with a degree in civil engineering. Valedictorian of his class, he was also a brother of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.\nCoach.\nTaking over for Heisman.\n\"Old Aleck,\" as Alexander was called, succeeded John Heisman as the head coach at Georgia Tech in April 1920. Alexander had been an assistant coach for Heisman and a math teacher in the classroom at Georgia Tech. The \"Technique\" said of him:\nAlexander also had a sense of humor. Whenever he diagrammed a football play, he always drew very small \"x's\" to represent Georgia Tech players and very large circles to represent the opposing players. As a new coach, he led Georgia Tech to three Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles (1920, 1921, 1922) and its second national championship in 1928. Buck Flowers and Red Barron starred on his first teams. Alexander was the first college football coach to place his teams in the four major post-season bowl games of the time: Sugar, Cotton, Orange, and Rose. His teams won three of the four bowls.\nDoug Wycoff.\nDescribing the most spectacular play he ever saw, he cites one from the 1925 game against Vanderbilt. Star back Doug Wycoff was hurt, such that he had to use his substitute Dick Wright. On a muddy field, Wright ran off tackle and dodged Vanderbilt's safety Gil Reese, \"usually a sure tackler,\" to get the touchdown to give Tech a 7 to 0 victory. Coach Alexander further recalled \"The work of Douglas Wycoff against Notre Dame two years in succession was brilliant in the extreme, as was his plunging against Penn. State when we defeated them twice.\"\nThe Plan.\nDuring the 1927 season, Alexander instituted \"the Plan.\" Tech and UGA had just renewed their annual rivalry game in 1925 after an eight-year . Georgia was highly rated to start the season and justified their rating throughout the season going 9–0 in their first 9 games. Alexander's plan was to minimize injuries by benching his starters early no matter the score of every game before the UGA finale. On December 3, 1927, UGA rolled into Atlanta on the cusp of a National Title. Tech's well rested starters shut out the Bulldogs 12–0 and ended any chance of UGA's first National Title.\n1928.\nAlexander's 1928 team would be the very first Tech team to attend a bowl game. The team had amassed a perfect 9–0 record and was invited to the 1929 Rose Bowl to play California. Tech traveled by train to meet the awaiting Golden Bears. The game was a defensive struggle with the first points being scored after a Georgia Tech fumble. The loose ball was scooped up by California Center Roy Riegels and then accidentally returned in the wrong direction. Riegels returned the ball all the way to Georgia Tech's 3 yard line. After Riegels was finally stopped by his own team, the Bears opted to punt from the end zone. The punt was blocked and converted by Tech into a safety giving Tech a 2–0 lead. Cal would score a touchdown and point after but Tech would score another touchdown to finally win the game 8–7. This victory made Tech the 10–0 undefeated national champions of the 1928 college football season. It was Tech's second national title in 11 years.\nDepression.\nCoach Alexander found campus spirit to be particularly low during the Great Depression. His football program and the other athletic teams had very few student fans attending the games. His football team faded in success after 1928, not posting another winning record until 1937. He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. The group would later become the Ramblin' Reck Club.\nAD.\nOn January 30, 1945, Coach Alexander retired as head football coach but remained Georgia Tech's athletic director until his death in 1950. Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech football coach.\nLegacy.\nAlexander was succeeded as head coach by one of his assistants, Bobby Dodd, who became the most successful head football coach in Georgia Tech history. Dodd lionized Coach Alexander, which was later reflected in his coaching style. \"He taught me to treat athletes as men, not boys - to never use their failings as an alibi for a loss,\" Dodd said.\nThe Alexander Memorial Coliseum (recently renamed Hank McCamish Pavilion), the home arena of Georgia Tech's basketball teams, was named after him."

        "title": "European Masters (snooker)",
        "text": "The European Masters is a professional ranking snooker tournament that has been staged periodically since 1989 as the European Open. Between 2005 and 2008 it was known as the Malta Cup and was the sole ranking tournament in Europe outside the British Isles, before being discontinued. In 2016, the event was resurrected and rebranded the European Masters.\nHistory.\nBefore the 1988/89 season, there were no ranking events outside the United Kingdom. There were, however, many successful invitation events, so the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association decided to extend the tour with some overseas events. The first two were held in Canada and mainland Europe. The first European event was the European Open in 1988 in Deauville, France, with the sponsorship of ICI. The event then was held at the Palais des Sports in Lyon, France, for 1992 and at the Imax Centre in Rotterdam, Netherlands with the sponsorship of Tulip Computers.\nThe event was then moved to Belgium. It was held in Tongeren in 1992 and Antwerp between 1993 and 1994 with sponsorship from Humo. The event was moved to the first half of the season in 1993/1994, thus there were two events in 1993, in February and December. The event was moved back to its original place in the calendar in 1995/1996 and took place in Valletta, Malta between 1996 and 1997. The event was held in Tallaght, Ireland in 1998 as the Irish Open. In the 1999/2000 season the Malta Grand Prix was the only continental European ranking event and in 2000/2001 there were none for the first time in 13 seasons.\nThe European Open was revived in 2001/2002 and was held in Valletta, Malta. In 2003 the event was held in England for the first time (Torquay). The following year it returned to Malta, this time held in Portomaso. The following season event was renamed the Malta Cup. The 2006 event was the first ranking tournament, where no English player reached the quarter-finals. It became an invitation event in 2007/2008, but it was discontinued afterwards.\nIn 2016, it was announced that the event would be revived under the name European Masters in Romania for the next three years. However, in 2017 it was announced that the tournament would be held in Belgium that year. In 2020, it was held in Milton Keynes, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The 2022 event will be held at the same venue, after COVID-19 rates in Bavaria prevented it from being held at the Stadthalle in Fürth. The final was traditionally played as a best-of-17 frames match, but for 2022, it was extended to a best-of-19.\nThere has been five maximum breaks in the history of the tournament. Alain Robidoux made the first in the first qualifying round of the 1989 event against Jim Meadowcroft. The second was Shaun Murphy's fifth official maximum break, which he compiled in the second qualifying round of the 2016 event against Allan Taylor. The third and fourth came at the qualifying stage of the 2022 event. On 16 July, Zhang Anda made a maximum break during his 5–1 win over Anton Kazakov; the following day, Hossein Vafaei made a maximum as he defeated Ng On-yee by the same score. It was the first time either player had made a 147 in professional competition. The most recent maximum break was made by Sean O'Sullivan in the qualifying round of the 2023 event against Barry Hawkins."

        "title": "Global Basketball Association",
        "text": "The Global Basketball Association (GBA) was a professional basketball minor league based in the United States. The majority of the league's franchises were based in the Southern United States, with the remaining teams located in the Midwest. The league announced plans for franchises in European cities that never materialized. The league began play in 1991 and lasted one and a half seasons before folding in December 1992.\nHistory.\nWhen the league was announced in 1991, league officials said there would be franchises around the world, hence the name \"Global Basketball Association\" (GBA). The league was owned and founded by Ted Stepien, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers from 1980 to 1983. Two international teams were announced: Tallinn, Soviet Union (now Estonia) and San Marino. The team from the Soviet Union was KK Kalev, which was a professional basketball team founded in 1920. The four American teams announced were Greensboro, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee and Greenville, South Carolina. Vilvoorde, Belgium and Évry, France were later awarded GBA franchises.\nMike Storen, who served as commissioner of the American Basketball Association from 1973 to 1975, was named commissioner of the GBA. The league announced a 64-game schedule in from November 1991 to March 1992, followed by a playoff for the league championship. To distinguish itself from other basketball leagues, the GBA used a white basketball, which was manufactured by MacGregor.\nIn May 1991, the GBA awarded a charter franchise to Huntsville, Alabama. The GBA merged Pro Basketball USA, another fledgling basketball minor league, in August 1991. The GBA adopted six of Pro Basketball USA's franchises: the Albany Sharp Shooters, the Louisville Shooters, the Memphis HotShots, the Fayetteville Flyers, the Mid-Michigan Great Lakers and the Wichita Outlaws.\nThe GBA draft was held on August 3, 1991 in Atlanta, Georgia. It was broken-up into three rounds. The first round was the territorial round where teams were limited to selecting players within a 100-mile radius of their home arena. In the second round, teams could only draft free agents. The third and final round was the collegiate draft, where teams could pick players from colleges across the United States. The Greensboro City Gaters selected Keith Gatlin with the first overall pick in the draft.\nBy the start of the 1991–92 season in November 1991, the GBA only had franchises based in the United States. League officials said the international teams would begin play in the 1992–93 season. The Mid-Michigan Great Lakers let people attend the first few games for free, which attracted around 3,000 attendees per game. When the Great Lakers started charging for tickets, the team averaged 200 attendees. The Music City Jammers were last in attendance, averaging 300 people per game. They played a game on February 2, 1992 at the 11,000 seat Nashville Municipal Auditorium, which had a total attendance (including the players, referees and statisticians) of 136.\nThe Louisville Shooters in October 1991 announced plans for a $125,000 to $175,000 marketing campaign to advertise the GBA's inaugural season. The firm Bridgemon, James &amp; Shawver Advertising Inc.—who also worked on marketing for the Louisville Redbirds professional baseball team—was contracted to run the campaign which consisted of newspaper ads, television and radio ads and a 30-minute infomercial on WAVE (TV). By February 1992, team owner Jim Tilton told \"Business First-Louisville\" the Shooters were facing \"a pretty heavy loss\" and he was seeking a new line of credit to keep the team afloat. The team had sold 150 season tickets and were averaging 2,250 attendees per game. A deal to sell the Shooters to an ownership group led by David Gleason fell through. By mid-March 1992, the Shooters had their telephone service shut off for failed payment. On March 31, 1992, the office furniture at the team's headquarters was repossessed. The team also had to forfeit their first round playoff series against the Mid-Michigan Great Lakers due to failure to pay rent on their home venue, Louisville Gardens. As of April 1992, the Shooters owed $23,000 in back rent to the Louisville Gardens owners.\nAfter the 1991–92 season, GBA commissioner Mike Storen announced he was stepping away from the league to focus on his sports marketing business.\nDavid Gleason, who attempted to purchase the Louisville Shooters in February 1992, eventually purchased the franchise from Jim Tilton. Gleason said the purchase did not include the legal obligation for $300,000 in outstanding debts owed by Tilton, however, Gleason still had to pay the debts as he wanted his debtors services. He had to settle his account with Bridgemon, James &amp; Shawver Advertising Inc. before they would agree to continue working for the team. When they did settle the debt, the advertising firm only agreed to work on an hourly rate and would no longer let debts accrue. Gleason came to an agreement that let him continue to use Louisville Gardens as the team's home venue. The Shooters folded after three games into the 1992–93 season. The league itself disbanded in December 1992."

        "text": "A triple century (an individual score of 300 runs or more) in Test cricket has been scored on 31 occasions by 27 batsmen from eight of the twelve Test-cricket playing nations. No player from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ireland or Zimbabwe has scored 300. The frequency of a batsman scoring a Test triple century is slightly lower than that of a bowler taking a Test hat-trick (31 triple centuries versus 46 hat-tricks as of April 2022).\nHistory.\nThe first Test triple century was achieved by Andy Sandham of England against the West Indies in 1930 in the first Test series hosted in the West Indies. The quickest Test triple-century was scored in 4 hours 48 minutes, by Wally Hammond for England against New Zealand at Auckland in 1932–33. The fastest Test triple-century by number of balls faced, where that figure is recorded, is Virender Sehwag's 278-ball triple century for India against South Africa in the first Test of the Future Cup in Chennai in 2008.\nDonald Bradman (Australia), Brian Lara (West Indies), Virender Sehwag (India), and Chris Gayle (West Indies) are the only batsmen to reach 300 more than once. Lara's 400 not out against England in 2004, his second Test triple-century, is the highest score in Test cricket and the only instance of a Test quadruple century; Lara is also the only player to have surpassed 350 twice. Bradman also scored 299 not out against South Africa in 1932. Sehwag also scored 293 off 254 balls in the third Test between Sri Lanka and India in December 2009. On an all-round note, Gooch, Jayasuriya and Clarke are the only triple centurions to have also bowled and taken wickets in the same match as scoring a 300: there has not yet been a triple centurion who kept wicket in the same match (Sangakkara and McCullum were both regular keepers for their nations, but both were playing purely as batsmen in the matches where they scored their respective 300s). Simpson, Gooch, Taylor, Lara (2004), Jayawardene, Khan, Clarke and McCullum are the only batsmen to score triple centuries as captain.\nThe two cricket grounds with the most triple centuries scored at them are Headingley in Leeds, England, and the Antigua Recreation Ground in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda, both with three. The most triple centuries scored by players from one country is eight, by Australia."

        "text": "The Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year is an annual cricket award, presented to the young player who is adjudged to have been the best of the year in English county cricket. The award has been presented since the 1950 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the Cricket Writers' Club. Only players that are qualified to represent the England cricket team, and are aged under 23 on 1 May of the awarding year, are eligible for the prize. With the exception of 1986, when a joint award was made, the accolade has been presented to one individual each season. The award has been described by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) as \"prestigious\". Although not a firm rule, once a player has won the award, they are considered ineligible to receive it in the future.\nArchie Ledbrooke, a sports reporter for the \"Daily Mirror\" and the first treasurer of the Cricket Writers' Club, came up with the idea for the award. It was first presented in 1950, when Roy Tattersall of Lancashire was the recipient. In 1986, the vote was tied, and the award was made jointly to Ashley Metcalfe of Nottinghamshire and James Whitaker of Leicestershire. The 1995 winner, Andrew Symonds, went on to make over 200 international appearances for Australia, but at the time of his award was eligible to play for England, as he was born in Birmingham. , representatives of seventeen of the eighteen first-class cricket counties have won the award; no player from Worcestershire has ever won. Yorkshire players have collected the award most frequently, doing so on eleven occasions. Only seven winners have not gone on to play international cricket.\nOn eleven occasions, the Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year has also been named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for that season. Since 1990, 17 of the 31 winners have also collected the PCA Young Player of the Year award, selected by members of the players' trade union, the Professional Cricketers' Association."

Since 1998, it has been held at Golf Club Gut Lärchenhof in Pulheim near Cologne. The prize fund had climbed to €3 million by 2005, making the German Masters one of the richer tournaments on the PGA European Tour at that time outside of the major championships and the three individual World Golf Championships.\nAfter a one-year break in 2006, the tournament returned to the European Tour schedule in 2007, renamed as the Mercedes-Benz Championship. Played as a no-cut event, it had a maximum field of 78, consisting primarily of players who had either won tournaments on the European Tour in 2007 or were in the top 75 of the Official World Golf Rankings or in the top 60 of the European Order of Merit. It was played in mid-September, a slot created by the rescheduling of the HSBC World Match Play Championship to October. However, as it clashed with the PGA Tour's Tour Championship, many leading players were unavailable, and so the prize fund had dropped to €2 million on its return, one third less than it was in 2005."

        "text": "Cycling shorts (also known as bike shorts, bicycling shorts, chamois, knicks, or spats or thigh cling shorts) are short, skin-tight garments designed to improve comfort and efficiency while cycling. \nTheir useful properties are:\nHistorically, cycling shorts were made of knit black wool, which hides wear marks caused by sitting on an oiled leather saddle for extended periods of time, with a chamois leather padding inside the shorts in the crotch area, which reduces chafing from the bicycle saddle. Modern cycling shorts are often made of spandex (Lycra) with a synthetic chamois which acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and are produced in a variety of shapes and styles to suit the needs of different riders. On some cycling shorts different materials are often placed on different parts of the shorts to take advantage of each material's benefit, providing a very efficient cycling short. For example, the patterns used for the chamois on women's cycling shorts tend to be quite different from those used for men's. The hem of each leg is usually lined with elastic and/or silicone that clings to the skin, keeping it in a fixed position. These shorts made from several panels (or cuts of fabric) fit better and are more beneficial, especially for racers, but cost more.\nShort-legged elastic tights commonly worn as street wear, under girls' skirts and dresses, with longer oversized t-shirts, sweat shirts and sweaters, for gymnastics and ballet practice, or under athletic and running shorts, are sometimes also referred to as \"bike shorts\", but they are typically simpler and lighter garments than those worn by cyclists and generally lack the chamois or faux-chamois lining and may have plain or lace trimmed hems.\nBib shorts.\nBib shorts are cycling shorts that are held up by a bib (integral suspenders/braces) instead of an elastic waistband. Pro and serious riders tend to prefer bib shorts over non-bib shorts, due to the discomfort that often occurs with an elastic waistband, such as tightness (digging into skin) and chafing. The bib part of the short is often made of spandex and polyester with large sections of netting to help keep the rider cool.\nThe idea of modern bib shorts was a development from the braces (UK) or suspenders (US) that cyclists once used to hold up old-fashioned wool shorts, which had a tendency to become loose and heavy from riders' sweat (the use of braces/suspenders meant the shorts could be held up without an uncomfortably tight waistband). Bib shorts are well-suited to tall riders and riders with protruding stomachs because regular shorts can tend to fall down in the back while riding.\nMountain bike shorts.\nThese shorts typically are more loose than bib shorts but still not baggy. This is because they are focused more on protecting the rider during falls and are not as focused on aerodynamic efficiency. The position of the padding is a little different because mountain bikers have a more upright body position when riding. These shorts are different from baggy shorts as they are used by hardcore cyclists who still need the protection with a good padding, which the baggy shorts do not have.\nBaggy shorts.\nBaggy shorts (or \"shy shorts\") are cycling shorts that look like regular shorts on the outside, but that are designed for cycling. Some have a thin chamois lining on the inside. This lining ranges from polyester fabric to full eight-panel, form-fitting cycling shorts beneath the baggier outside shorts. Others are designed to be worn with a separate liner short underneath. These shorts provide a more casual look when riding around town and off dedicated bike paths. These shorts are basically dual purpose in that the wearer need not to change from tight singular purpose cycling shorts into casual clothes when going out yet have some of the benefits of wearing cycling shorts."

He was again placed on injured reserve, this time with a fractured right kneecap.\nMcKenzie was released by the Saints on March 19, 2009. He tried out with the Seattle Seahawks and Houston Texans during summer 2009 but did not sign. When the Saints, in the midst of their most successful season in team history, suffered a rash of injuries and were left with almost no healthy cornerbacks on the roster, the team re-signed McKenzie on November 23, 2009 after he had called head coach Sean Payton to ask for his job back. In his first game in more than a year, a highly anticipated, nationally televised match with New England, McKenzie intercepted an early pass by the Patriots' Tom Brady, and went on to play a key role in the team's dominant win.\nUltimately, McKenzie appeared in five games (two starts) for the Saints in 2009, recording 11 tackles and an interception. When the team's starting cornerbacks had recovered from their injuries, McKenzie was waived prior to the regular season finale on January 2, 2010, allowing the team to promote quarterback Chase Daniel to the active roster. Although McKenzie was no longer on the roster when the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV, the team awarded him with a Super Bowl ring in recognition of his contributions.\nPersonal.\nMcKenzie currently owns a home in New Orleans, Louisiana and splits his offseason residence between Miami, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee. McKenzie established a non-profit organization, the 34 Ways Foundation to help underprivileged youth. The Foundation serves various regions including Miami, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, Memphis, Tennessee, and Los Angeles, California. He was awarded the 2007 New Orleans Saints Man of the Year Award for this work. McKenzie has also established a winemaking business specializing in a wine made from orange moscato grapes."

        "title": "Cycling shoe",
        "text": "Cycling shoes are shoes purpose-built for cycling. There are a variety of designs depending on the type and intensity of the cycling for which they are intended. Key features include rigidity, for more-efficient transfer of power from the cyclist to the pedals, weight, a method of attaching the shoe firmly to the pedal and adaptability for use on and off the bicycle. Most high-performance cycling shoes can be adjusted while in use, via a quick-adjusting system that has largely replaced laces.\nPedal systems.\nModern cycling shoes are designed to work with clipless pedal systems. Such systems temporarily connect the shoe to the pedal in a manner similar to a ski binding system. The aim is maximal efficiency of power-transfer, using a cleat on the sole of each shoe and a matched fitting on the pedal. Several manufacturers produce such systems; consequently, modern shoes often have threaded holes in the sole in various arrangements to attach cleats of differing designs from different manufacturers.\nBroadly there are two styles of clipless pedals, still referred to as “road” and “MTB” (mountain bike). Road pedals use a wide cleat, usually of hard plastic, which makes walking difficult (or, without care, hazardous) but gives good power transfer and is comfortable on long rides. A mountain-bike-style shoe uses a small steel cleat recessed into the sole of the shoe. It enables reasonable walking or running when dismounted.\nThe toe-clip and toestrap is an older system, still much used in one format. A toeclip is a metal cage attached to the front of the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toeclip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback - a serious inconvenience in stop-start cycling - is that the rider has to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take a foot out of the toeclip and off the pedal and for this reason toeclips with slotted shoe plates have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second method, still widely used, is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or even a suitable non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage that the rider's feet are not firmly attached to the pedals (while nonetheless being constrained and supported) but had the advantage of allowing the shoe to slide backwards out from the toeclip and away from the pedals from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand. Some non-cycling shoes can be used, if compact enough to fit into the cage of the toeclip.\nSole material and shoe quality.\nSoles for cycling shoes are usually divided into three categories. Inexpensive shoes mostly use an injection-molded plastic sole, which is economical but heavier and prone to flexing. Mid-range shoes may use a combination of plastic and carbon fibre, plastic and fibreglass, or an all carbon-fibre sole. All manufacturers' high-end competition level shoes manufactured post-2002 use carbon fibre soles. The sole material and amount of shoe tread used in a shoe affects its weight; an expensive pair of road shoes with carbon fibre soles can weigh as little as 400 grams, while a budget-priced pair of mountain bike shoes might weigh 850 to 900 grams.\nSome mountain bike shoes have a little engineered frontal flex in the toe area forward of the cleat mount, and may carry a couple of studs, as used on the sole of football boots. This assists in walking and in climbing obstacles while carrying the bike. More expensive shoes usually have less frontal flex.\nVariety.\nCycling shoes come in numerous variants: road racing, track racing, winter, casual cycling, touring, off-road or mountain biking, and indoor cycling or spinning. Though many cycling shoe suppliers will have a conversion to American, British, French or even Japanese sizing, most cycling shoes are measured in European sizing. The available sizes range from European 35 to as large as 52. A few cycling shoe suppliers offer selected models wider than the standard \"D\" width. A small number of custom cycling shoe makers will tailor a shoe to a cyclist's exact foot size and shape.\nRoad.\nThese have a mostly smooth, rigid and inflexible sole, bent slightly at the ball of the foot. This, and the cleat attached to the shoe bottom, make a clicking sound when they come together and results in the waddle of the walking cyclist. These shoes are designed to function while the user is on the bike and little attention is paid to off-bike use. Most road shoes have a raised and generally different material from the outsole at the toe and heel to make stopping and short walks a little easier. Some road shoe outsoles have additional holes which are claimed to assist in ventilation. Quality can be measured by the shoe's fit, rigidity, durability, construction quality and lightness. Road shoes have molded holes with threaded inserts inside to allow for the attachment of an external cleat. Many cycling shoes use a three-hole system for attaching the cleat which is sometimes called a \"Look pattern\" after the company that popularized the clipless pedal in the middle 1980s. Lake, DMT and Sidi now offer a purpose designed, Speedplay pedal compatible shoe. These cleats attach to a clipless pedal making them even more unsuitable for walking. The 2010 price range for a road cycling shoe in the US is from $70 to over $450. Sizes available range from 35 to 52, with most companies offering sizes ranging from 39 to 46. Most companies offer models in European half sizes in the middle and largest selling size range, and a rare few offer shoes in wider than \"D\" width in limited models.\nTriathlon.\nTriathlon-specific shoes are usually a variant of road shoes. The key features include: quick foot entry and exit, sockless, and good drainage. During a triathlon, the athlete needs to change quickly from the swim to bike phase and from bike to run phase. At competitive levels, there is no time for socks or fiddly buckles. The shoes are usually pre-clipped to the pedals and feet are inserted after mounting the bike. The shoes often have a single big velcro fastening as opposed to laces or 3 velcro/ratchet straps.\nTrack.\nVelodrome or track racing is popular in the UK, Australia, parts of the US and the traditional cycling countries of Europe. Companies have developed track-specific shoes to address the very specialized needs of the track racer. These shoes tend to be simple and traditional with lace closures for best fit with pedal straps; they frequently use the lightest and most rigid materials. The point is to allow the rider to apply full force to the pedals without worrying about the shoes stretching, coming off or coming unclipped. Keirin riders, sprinters, and track time trial riders and some others prefer a track-specific shoe to a standard cycling shoe. Track-specific models are offered by relatively small number of manufacturers such as Riivo, Bont, DMT, Suplest (though named as road), and EZNI.\nTouring.\nThe traditional cycling tourist usually used toe clips and straps, but touring shoes designed for use with clipless pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively. Touring shoes may sacrifice some rigidity for traction and add treads.\nCasual.\nThis type of shoe generally has a soft outsole (as compared with a road shoe) and a molded internal midsole. They are shaped more like a street or trail shoe with a less exaggerated \"rocker\" allowing a more normal gait. The outsole usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day hiking boot and is a compromise between an aggressive off-road shoe and an old-style touring shoe. These shoes have a molded midsole which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can be walked in more-or-less normally. There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the outsole where a piece of the outsole material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the midsole and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on. Most of these cleats follow Shimano's \"SPD\" system (“Shimano Pedal Dynamics”). Other two-bolt cleat and pedal systems for use with casual cycling and MTB shoes are produced by Crank Brothers, Speedplay and Ritchey, to name a few. Casual cycling shoes normally have a US retail price of under $100. Sizes range from 35 to 50 in European sizing.\nSandals.\nUsually a subcategory of casual, sandals follow Shimano's \"SPD\" system. Manufacturers include Keen, Shimano, and Nashbar.\nMountain bike.\nThese shoes also use the two-slot cleat mounting system like casual cycling shoes but have a more aggressive, lugged outsole for better performance when the rider has to get off the bike to run or to push or carry the bike. Most of these shoes allow for attachment of two screw-in studs or spikes in the toe area for more traction in mud or steep trails. The cleats used on mountain bike shoes are also depressed below the treads of the sole, keeping them from contact with the ground. Injection-molded nylon midsoles reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber-reinforced injection molded nylon and hand-laid carbon fiber midsoles can be found, depending on manufacturer and price range. Prices in the US in 2010 range from $70 to well over $350 for the most expensive models. Sizes are available from 35 to 50, with some companies offering a wider model or two.\nIndoor.\nOften called Spinning shoes, after the company that popularized fitness club classes led by an instructor using stationary bicycles. A few companies have developed shoe models intended to cater to the indoor cyclist, including Nike, Lake, SIDI, Specialized, Exustar and others. These shoes have not been widely accepted due to their limited availability and a fragmented consumer market. US retail prices as of 2010 are generally under $90, with the normal range of sizes available.\nWinter.\nCycling shoes with insulated, over-ankle coverage have been available for a number of years from Lake, Sidi, Northwave, Exustar, Gaerne and others. Some of these companies offer both road and off-road versions of their shoes, and some offer more than one model, with varying degrees of protection from cold, wind and moisture. Lake shoes have been used by riders who have won the Iditabike, which is an extreme adventure race in Alaska.\nOvershoes.\nOvershoes (or \"booties\") are flexible waterproof shoe coverings for use in wet weather. They are typically made from rubber or a stretchy synthetic and have a zip on the inside of the ankle. The fabric continues under the sole but is not intended for walking on, which would wear it out quickly. Most overshoes have a hole in the sole for clipless pedals. Overshoes are not to be confused with cleat covers. Overshoes go on the top of the shoes, while cleat covers go on the bottom."

        "text": "In baseball, the 1884 World Series was a post-season championship series between the Providence Grays of the National League and the New York Metropolitans of the American Association at the Polo Grounds in New York City.\nWhile the 1884 post-season championship series was the first such to be referred to as the \"World's Series,\" Major League Baseball considers the 1903 World Series the first. Nonetheless, the 1884 series was baseball's first inter-league championship contest.\nHistory.\nIn 1884, Metropolitans manager Jim Mutrie issued a challenge to his NL counterpart, Frank Bancroft of the Grays. Mutrie's challenge was for a best-of-three series. Each team would put up a thousand dollars with the winner taking all.\nThis pre-modern-era World Series would feature a pitching match-up of future Hall of Famers and 300-game winners Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn and Tim Keefe. That was the year Radbourn won his season-record 59 games (some sources say 60) for the Grays. Keefe was a \"mere\" 37–17. Playing under American Association rules, Radbourn and the Grays defeated the New York team in the first two games, 6–0 and 3–1.\nOnly the first game went the full nine innings; the others were called after seven and six, because of darkness and extreme cold, respectively. The third game arguably should never have been played as the format was best-of-three, and Providence clinched in two. It was played with the hope of generating further revenue.\nThe crowd for the third game comprised only 300 people due to bitter cold. The Grays did not want to play due to the weather but were given the option of choosing the umpire if they would play. The Grays accepted and strategically chose Keefe, the Mets best pitcher. Radbourn, pitching his third complete game in three days, led the Grays to a 12–2 rout. For the series, Radbourn allowed 11 hits and no earned runs in 22 innings.\nLocal newspaper \"The New York Clipper\" called the series \"The Championship of the United States.\" Several newspapers such as \"The Sporting Life\" penned the Grays as \"World Champions\", and the new title stuck.\nThe total attendance for the three games was 3,800. Despite the low attendance, the two leagues continued the series, and attendance and prize money increased each of the next two years.\nThe World Series of 1884.\nProvidence Grays (NL) (84–28) vs New York Metropolitans (AA) (75–32)\nGame 1.\nThursday, October 23, at the Polo Grounds.\nProvidence defeats New York 6–0\nUmpire: John Kelly\nTime of game: 2:00\nW: Old Hoss Radbourn (1–0)\nL: Tim Keefe (0-1)\nGame 2.\nFriday, October 24, at the Polo Grounds\nProvidence defeats New York 3–1 (7 innings)\nUmpire: John Remsen\nTime of game: 1:35\nW: Old Hoss Radbourn (2–0)\nL: Tim Keefe (0-2)\nGame 3.\nSaturday, October 25, at the Polo Grounds\nProvidence defeats New York 12–2 (6 innings)\nUmpire: Tim Keefe\nTime of game: 1:20\nW: Old Hoss Radbourn (3–0)\nL: Buck Becannon (0-1)"

        "title": "Australia at the Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Australia first competed in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and has participated in every games since, with the exception of the 1948 Games in St. Moritz.\nIn the early years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes placed in the top half of their events before 1976, while the vast majority placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.\nAfter the appointment of Geoff Henke—who had been unable to compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.\nAustralia won its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first individual medal in 1998, when she won bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have won a gold medal at a Winter Olympics until 2022.\nAustralia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin. Their goal of winning a medal was achieved when Dale Begg-Smith won the gold in men's freestyle moguls skiing. Camplin claimed her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event.\nAt the 2010 Games in Vancouver Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics taking home two gold and one silver medal. Begg-Smith won a silver in the moguls, while Torah Bright and Lydia Lassila won the women's half-pipe snowboarding and aerial freestyle skiing respectively.\nAt the 2014 Games, Australia sent its largest ever Winter Olympic Team, 60 athletes, to Sochi, competing in 10 sports. The Sochi Team included 31 female athletes making it the first Australian Olympic Team, Summer or Winter, with more female athletes than male. Australia again won three medals with David Morris (aerial skiing) and Torah Bright (snowboard halfpipe) winning silver and Lydia Lassila (aerial skiing) finishing with bronze.\nOverall Australia has won 19 Winter Olympic medals - 6 gold, 7 silver and 6 bronze.\nHistory.\nEarly struggles.\nWinter sports have traditionally been second to summer pursuits in Australian sporting culture, but interest and support in the former has grown. The decision-making bodies of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) allowed winter sports to be represented, but their representatives were usually overruled by their summer counterparts.\nThe first Winter Olympics took place in 1924. Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, Kenneth Kennedy, participated in speed skating. Kennedy came 33rd in both the 1500 m and 5000 m, near the bottom of the standings. He was entirely on his own; no Australian support staff were in attendance, even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy's entry.\nThe Olympics were then halted due to the outbreak of World War II. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. There were five skiers, two cross-country and three downhill—who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown—three figure skaters and one speed skater. Adrian Swan and Nancy Burley, who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating, respectively, were the only two Australia competitors to place in the top 20, although neither placed in the top half of the field. Burley and fellow figure skater Gweneth Molony were the first two women to represent Australia at the Winter Olympics.\nSupervision and support for the athletes were relatively minimal in the early years. Colin Hickey said that he never received clothing from the AOF, except for a black armband and tie for the 1952 Olympics to mourn the death of King George VI. He also said that Australian officials had \"no control over me ... All they'd do was tell me what times I had to do\". Hickey was uncoached and had travelled to Europe at the age of 18 to support himself and race. In 1952, a support staffer was present for the first time; Robert \"George\" Chisholm was the first manager of an Australian Winter Olympic team. The lack of administrative attention was highlighted when Chisholm incorrectly declared that the campaign was Australia's first at the Winter Olympics.\nAt the 1956 Winter Olympics, Hickey, a \"rink rat\" who was overlooked for ice hockey when he was young because of his small frame, came seventh in the 500 and 1000 metres speed skating at his second Olympics. He later won a bronze medal at the world championships. Australia's nine other competitors were less successful; two male figure skaters—Allan Ganter and Charles Keeble—placed in the top 15 but in the bottom 25% in the individual event, while the pairs combination of Mervyn Bower and Jacqueline Mason failed to take to the ice after Bower was injured. The five downhill skiers were Australia's least successful entrants; the highest finish was 33rd and the median was 60th, and all were near the bottom of their events. Australia sent its first coach and female staffer for the 1956 campaign; C. Mason oversaw the skaters and Lillian Chisholm acted as the chaperone. The ice hockey team offered to pay their own way to compete; the only thing that they needed from the AOF was formal permission. However, the AOF never responded to their request; they were unable to attend, and criticised the AOF for their lack of interest. One of the affected athletes was Geoff Henke, later credited for ending the neglect of winter sports when he became an administrator.\nAustralia sent 31 athletes in 1960, its largest team before the 2006 Winter Olympics; their size was boosted by an outclassed 18-man ice hockey team, which conceded 83 goals in losing all six matches. They lost to Czechoslovakia 18–1 and the United States 12–1 in their two group matches, and were then placed into a group with Finland and Japan, the last-placed teams in the two other preliminary groups. The Australians played two matches against each of the other teams to determine the three worst teams in the nine-country contest. They lost all four matches, conceding a total of 53 goals. Australia scored only 10 goals in reply.\nHal Nerdal competed in Nordic combined, the only time that Australia has participated in the event at the Olympics, and finished last. Four years after injury prevented them from competing, Bower and Mason recorded Australia's best result, placing 12th in the pairs figure skating, although they were still second to last. Hickey and two male figure skaters—who were close to last—were the only Australians to place in the top 20, while Christine Davy became the first Australian to break into the top 30 in a skiing event, although she too was in the bottom 20% of the competition. The athletes were accompanied by seven staff members, the largest Australian support contingent until 1988. Chisholm mistakenly noted in his official report that it was Australia's second participation, forgetting the delegations sent in 1936, 1952 and 1956.\nWith the ice hockey team in mind, there was debate about the trade-off between selection standards and participation after the 1960 Winter Olympics. At a 1963 meeting, Kenneth Kennedy complained that the ice hockey team was not given overseas trips to compete because they were not world class, but could never become competitive unless they had experience in international matches. Edgar Tanner said \"I ask the winter sports whether they really believe they are in world class, or world ranking, in the field of sport and whether they can do Australia credit, or just be there.\" Bill Young, of cycling, disagreed, saying \"I thought the first spirit of the Games was to compete\", but was overruled by Tanner.\nIn contrast to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete despite a lack of experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in the bottom half of the field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.\nMotivated in part by a desire to prove that Australians could compete at the highest level, and believing that claims that his brother died due to inexperience was a smokescreen intended to cover-up the poor safety standards, Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship. In 1968, Milne finished 24th in both the downhill and slalom events, Australia's best result in a skiing event up to that point. Ross Martin came 60th in both cross-country events, and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events. Australia had more officials present than athletes, with five competitors and three administrators. This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, which were attended by five staff and four athletes. Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in the downhill and slalom respectively, as did Coates, who came in the top 30 in three of his four events, including an 18th-place result in the 10,000 m event. Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near-fall, he would have placed near the medalists.\nHenke era.\nUp to this point, Australia's performances had been poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative asked for the selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, and went on to explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.\nAfter the 1968 Winter Olympics, at which the only Australian alpine skier was Milne, skiing delegate Peter Blaxland said that the country should not send a solitary skier for psychological reasons. The Winter Olympics team manager reported that his European counterparts were surprised by Australia's small team. The response from the board—dominated by Summer Olympics delegates—was unsympathetic, with Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes expressing concern that uncompetitive athletes might be selected. The neglect of the Winter Olympics continued until Henke's appointment as team manager in 1976. Henke held the position for two decades, until Ian Chesterman took over in 1998. He rose to become vice-president of the AOF, and is credited with ending the administrative neglect of winter sport. Up until Henke's appointment, Hickey and Milne were the only athletes to have placed in the top half of any event. In 1981, Henke took AOF board members into the Australian Alps for a board meeting, allowing him to exploit the environment to promote winter sport. He said that the next Olympics \"was the first time the AOF ever really got behind the winter team\".\nCoates reached his peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck. He competed in five events, and apart from a 25th-place finish in the 500 m event, did no worse than 11th in the remaining four. He came sixth in the 10,000 m, eighth in the 1,500 m and tenth in the 5,000 m. It was only the second time that an Australian had placed in the top 10, and remained Australia's best result until 1994. His five skiing compatriots were less productive; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications, with only one top 30 result.\nIn 1980, Australia's competing contingent rose into double figures for the first time since 1960, with 10 representatives. Jacqui Cowderoy became the first Australian to break into the top 20 in a skiing event, placing 17th in the slalom. The brother-and-sister pairing of Peter and Elizabeth Cain, Australia's first representatives in figure skating in 20 years, came 11th. Coates was unable to repeat his performances of four years earlier and his 18th and 19th places were Australia's only other top 20 results.\nIn 1984 in Sarajevo, Steven Lee and Cameron Medhurst placed 19th in the downhill and individual figure skating respectively. No other top 20 finishes were recorded among the 11 athletes, and the two cross-country skiers and the first Australian Olympic biathlete, Andrew Paul, finished no better than 47th in their eight events. Australia sent 15 athletes to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, where they competed in the bobsleigh for the first time. The two two-man bobsleigh teams came 23rd and 26th respectively, well down the field.\nAlthough a competitor on paper in 1988, Coates was supposed to only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as a competitor so that he could train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, when it was time for his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.\nThe 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France was viewed as the potential start of a new era in Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing and knocked over teammate John Kah during a changeover; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the top half. Kirstie Marshall was in the process of winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.\nThe 1992 Games also included Speedskiing as a demonstration sport, with four athletes qualified for the Games: Nick Kirshner, Les Herstik, Geoff Tasker and Daniel Guerin. Tasker and Kirshner's nominations where both rejected after their arrival in the village.\nFirst medals.\nIn 1994, the short track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They qualified for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating at least one of the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15 km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500 m and 1,000 m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.\nFurther medal success was anticipated at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier had become the first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1 m 32.67 s was only 0.27 s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected to do well in the aerials, but both crashed and failed to make the final. Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned but finished last, in eighth place.\nGolden breakthrough.\nThe improved results of the 1990s prompted higher expectations from the Australian Winter Olympic hierarchy. At the start of the 2002 Olympics, the Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman addressed the team, saying \"historically our winter teams have been the child racked by self-doubt, shy in nature as we saw our big brother, our summer Games team, take on and conquer the world.\" He added, \"but over time we have developed a belief in ourselves\".\nAustralia competed in five sports in 2002, the fewest sports entered in since 1984. Australian cross-country skiers were absent for the first time since 1976, and there were no bobsleigh sliders for the first time since Australia's debut in the sport in 1988. This was partly due to the AOC's higher selection standards than those of the IOC. Australian bobsledder Will Alstergren lamented that \"We also beat half the teams currently in Salt Lake City, but unfortunately we couldn't meet the very high standard of the AOC\". According to the Skiing Australia Cross Country Committee, tougher AOC selection standards contributed to the failure to compete in the discipline in 2002.\nIn 2002, Australia won their first two gold medals, the first time any southern hemisphere country had won an event. Australia's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances. Steven Bradbury, a member of the bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of his competitors in the 1,000 m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions. He had qualified for the final after benefiting from similar incidents and disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals. Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal and would have been eliminated, but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed.\nBradbury's strategy from the semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed, as he realised that he could not match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.\nIn the semifinal, three skaters, including the defending champion, crashed into each other and Bradbury moved up into second place to qualify for the final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.\nHaving won three consecutive World Cup titles, Jacqui Cooper was the favourite in the aerials, but injured herself in training and was sent home days before the competition. Alisa Camplin, who had never won a World Cup event, won after exceeding her rivals' points tally on the second and final jump.\nIn 2006, Australia sent 40 athletes to compete in 10 sports. It was a record number of competitors and events, and Australian officials publicly declared their expectations of medal success. Aerial skiing medal hopeful Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly on the second qualification jump, while Jacqui Cooper, who placed first in the qualification round, crashed in both of her finals jumps. Camplin won bronze, her second Olympic medal. Dale Begg-Smith, considered the favourite in moguls skiing, won gold in the event. Torah Bright was rated as a medal chance in snowboarding half-pipe, and came fifth. Damon Hayler, rated as a medal chance in snowboard cross, came seventh. Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter less than two years earlier, was seen as a medal possibility in the skeleton, but inexperience with the intimidating and technical track contributed to her 13th place. As only eight teams competed in the men's short track speed skating relay, Australia had a good mathematical chance of winning a medal, but they failed to reach the final.\nIn 2010, Australia had its most successful Winter Olympics, ending with two gold and one silver. There were a further seven finishes in the top ten. Flagbearer Bright returned and won gold. After falling in her first run in the final—only the highest of the two runs is counted—she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase, and produced the top-score; the later competitors could not match her and she took victory. In 2010, Lydia Lassila (née Ierodiaconou) took gold, having come into the event as the reigning World Cup champion and favourite after setting a record score at a recent World Cup competition. After being second after the first jump, she scored highly on her final attempt, and the leader Xu Mengtao from China failed to land her second jump cleanly, sealing Lassila's win. Cooper returned for a final campaign and came fifth. Begg-Smith was again the favorite after three consecutive World Cup wins, but he was narrowly beaten by local skier Alexandre Bilodeau.\nRussian-born short-track speed skater Tatiana Borodulina, whose citizenship was expedited to allow her to compete, made the semifinals in two events, placing 7th and 11th. In the snowboard cross, Hayler came tenth, while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial, but crashed in the first round of racing. Scott Kneller came seventh in the men's ski cross, while Holly Crawford came eighth in half-pipe and Emma Lincoln-Smith tenth in the skeleton.\nIn 2014 at the Sochi, Russia Olympic Winter Games Australia won three Olympic medals and a total of 15 top 10 performances were recorded, a significant increase from the nine achieved in Vancouver in 2010. In addition Australia recorded 27 top 16 performances compared to 15 in Vancouver four years earlier.\nThis was a Team of history makers. Torah Bright became Australia's most successful female Winter Olympian by adding a silver medal to her gold from Vancouver in 2010. In Sochi, Bright was the only athlete to attempt three Snowboard events at the one Olympics: Slopestyle, Halfpipe and Snowboard Cross. David Morris, Australia's only male Aerialist at the Sochi Games wrote his own piece of Olympic history by completing a double-full full-full (quad twisting somersault) in the men's Freestyle Skiing – Aerials super-final. Morris scored 110.41 points for his jump and was awarded the silver medal. He was later honoured for his achievement by carrying the Australian flag in the Closing Ceremony. Aerials teammate and defending Olympic Aerial Skiing Champion Lydia Lassila was in Sochi to make history. Lydia chose to execute a jump in the women's super-final that no other woman in the history of the sport had attempted in competition, a quad twisting triple somersault. The high degree of difficulty jump scored her 72.12 points and the bronze medal. This historical effort has taken the sport of women's Aerials to a whole new level. Lassila is also the first mother to win a Winter Olympic medal for Australia. Bobsleigh's Jana Pittman became the first female Olympian to compete in both a Summer and Winter Olympics. Callum and Aimee Watson became the first siblings to compete at the same Games in Cross Country. Alex Almoukov pulled off the best ever performance by a male Australian biathlete when he finished 45th in the 20 km Individual. Other historic bests were John Farrow finishing 17th in the men's Skeleton, Belle Brockhoff, eighth in the women's Snowboard Cross and Kent Callister, ninth in the men's Snowboard Halfpipe.\nInfrastructure and training.\nAlthough Australia has competed in every Winter Olympics since 1936, it was not until the late 1980s that the athletes were supported by institutionalised training, government infrastructure or sports science. Malcolm Milne's success prompted the eventual starting of the Australian Ski Federation by Geoff Henke in the 1980s, and with it, a program to sponsor talented young skiers and send them to Europe to hone their craft. The beneficiaries of this program included Lee, Zali Steggall, and aerial skiers Cooper and Marshall. In 1993, a training centre and base called Sonnpark was set up in Axams, near Innsbruck, Austria, a joint venture between the Australian and Austrian Olympic Committees for summer and winter sports. Colin Hickey said about Sonnpark \"Yeah. It's great ... With that sort of back-up, we'd have given them [the Europeans] a run for their money.\" Australia sold the base in 2002. After the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (OWIA, initially called the Australian Institute of Winter Sports) was created. It was given a million-dollar annual budget; for the first time, Australia had a federal government–funded full-time winter sports training program to accompany the Australian Institute of Sport. This led to a steady rise in the number of Australians who won medals at World Cup events in the immediate years after the OWIA's creation. After the 2010 Olympics, the OWIA mooted plans to build a half-pipe course at Perisher in the Australian Alps, and a water jump in Brisbane for aerials freestyle training. In 2010, the OWIA's new training base, Icehouse, was opened in Melbourne. The largest facility of its type in the southern hemisphere, it features two large skating rinks and cost AUD58 million.\nThe Australian Olympic Committee (AOC, formerly the Australian Olympic Federation) is the peak body responsible for Australia's participation at the Olympics. Aside from funding the participation at the Olympics, the AOC provides money for the training and preparation of athletes. This occurs through their funding of the OWIA, grants for athletes to travel overseas to compete and the provision of monetary awards to athletes and their coaches if they win medals at World Cup events or World Championships in the lead up to the Olympics. The funding of the OWIA by the AOC varies by year, but hovers between AUD500,000 and 1,000,000, with a higher budget in the years immediately before an Olympics. Through the Australian Sports Commission, the federal government also sponsors OWIA, contributing more than half a million dollars a year. In 2009, the OWIA lobbied the government for an increase in its annual budget from AUD2.1m to AUD29.4m, a fraction of the AUD132m spent by Canada—the host of the 2010 Olympics. In contrast, the current funding for the Summer Olympics team is AUD128m per annum and the AOC asked for an increase of AUD108m annually in 2009. Australia aimed to win two medals in 2010, something that was achieved, and which Chesterman touted as justification for further funding to maintain and increase rankings in the face of growing expenditure by other countries.\nPublic participation and support for winter sports in Australia.\nAlthough Australia is generally considered to be more suited to summer sport, several ice-based sports take place as well. Snow falls on the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania. The Australian Alps are within six hours' drive for residents of Sydney, but within two hours' drive for residents of Melbourne and Canberra, Tasmanian ski slopes are within a day's drive for residents of the major cities of Hobart and Launceston. However, the season is quite short, as the snow is skiable for only about four months per year. Skiing in Australia was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of Kiandra, New South Wales, around 1859, near today's Selwyn Snowfields ski resort. The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major alpine skiing resorts include Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass in New South Wales; Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller in Victoria and Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania. Victoria has three dedicated cross-country ski resorts and extensive areas are available for cross-country skiing within national parks including Kosciuszko National Park (NSW), Alpine National Park (VIC); Namadgi National Park (ACT) and in the Tasmanian Wilderness.\nThe Kiandra snow shoe club is easily among the oldest continuing ski clubs in the world and was established by Norwegian gold prospectors in the mid-19th century. The Australian gold rushes first brought a population of skiers to the Australian snowfields in the 1860s. Ski chalets were established closer to Mount Kosciuszko in the early 20th century and the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme brought easier access and European workers with an interest in skiing, who helped build the modern ski resorts of New South Wales. In 2004, a mogul course called \"Toppa's Dream\" was constructed on Blue Cow. The Mount Buller World Aerials is an annual event on the World Cup calendar. Aerial skiers practice extensively on water before trying jumps on snow; Camplin jumped in a pond outside Melbourne. The Kangaroo Hoppet, a member of the Worldloppet Ski Federation series of cross-country skiing races, is an annual citizen race that attracts competitors from several countries. Ski jumping is currently non-existent in Australia.\nMany major Australian cities have indoor ice rinks, enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the climate. These began to appear at the end of the 19th century, and ice hockey was played as early as 1904. Sydney hosted the 1991 short-track speed skating World Championships, and the 2001 Goodwill Games—hosted in Brisbane—included figure skating. Australia has no tracks usable for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton, but there is a bobsleigh push track in the Docklands area of Melbourne.\nIn keeping with an existing tradition for Australian gold medallists at the Summer Olympics, Bradbury, Camplin and Begg-Smith's victories were recognised by Australia Post, which released stamps depicting their triumphs, and gave the athletes royalties for the use of their image. Due to the relative lack of interest in winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.\nOverview by sport.\nThe Olympic Winter Institute of Australia has programs in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (aerial and mogul), snowboarding, short track speed skating, figure skating and (along with the Australian Institute of Sport) skeleton. Australia also competed in biathlon, cross-country skiing, bobsleigh and luge at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nAlpine skiing.\nAustralia has competed in alpine skiing at every Olympics since 1952. Australia's first female skier, Christine Davy, competed in 1956. Malcolm Milne was considered a possible medalist at the 1972 Olympics, having finished on the podium at the world championships, but a knee injury and a near fall snuffed out his chances.\nSteven Lee represented Australia at three Winter Olympics; he won a World Cup event in Furano, Japan in the Super G event in 1985, and was the second Australian to do so. He achieved three top-25 finishes in his career. Zali Steggall won Australia's second Olympic bronze in the slalom event in 1998. Twelve skiers represented Australia at the 2002 Olympics with Jenny Owens achieving the best result in the Downhill Combined event with a 9th place. Four skiers represented Australia in 2006 and only half the number participated in 2010.\nBiathlon.\nAustralia has participated in biathlon at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15 km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% in each of his two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in the bottom half of the field, including many in the bottom fifth.\nFigure skating.\nAustralia first competed in figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1980. In earlier years, Australia earned some last places or near-misses. Until 1988, no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile, but results have slowly improved; Anthony Liu finished 10th out of 28 competitors in the men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 &amp; 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in the top half of the field. In 2010, Australia's lone participant Cheltzie Lee came 20th. Australia has competed in ice dancing only twice—in 1988 and 2014—when their solitary representative in both the men and women's individual event came last.\nFreestyle skiing.\nAustralia has contested moguls freestyle skiing in every Olympics since it became an official sport in 1992, as well as 1988, when it was a demonstration sport. Australia has participated in every aerial freestyle event since it became official in 1994, as well as 1992, when it was a demonstration event.\nUnlike in other winter disciplines, Australia started in the upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 competitors in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into the lower half of the rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.\nAustralia has been strong in women's aerial skiing, having recruited gymnasts into the sport, and Kirstie Marshall and Jacqui Cooper have both been regarded as major medal chances in the last 15 years. However, both were plagued by injuries and crashes and failed to medal at the Olympic level despite enjoying success in World Cup or world-championship events. Alisa Camplin won Australia's second gold in 2002. Australia fielded 4 of the 23 qualifiers in the women's aerials in 2006. Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly in the second qualification jump and failed to reach the final. Camplin and Cooper contested the aerials finals, after the latter qualified first with a world record score of 213.36. Cooper managed only 152.69 in the final and finished eighth, and Camplin went on to win bronze. In 2010, Lassila (née Ierodiaconou) took gold. After being second after the first jump, she scored highly on her final attempt, and the leader Xu Mengtao from China failed to land her second jump cleanly, sealing Lassila's win. Cooper returned for a final campaign and came fifth, while Elizabeth Gardner came 12th in the final. In contrast, Australia has not had a strong male tradition. Until 2010, no male had competed in aerials—one athlete was selected but did not end up taking to the snow due to injury. In 2010, David Morris ended the trend and came 13th out of 25 entrants.\nSki cross was introduced in 2010. Scott Kneller reached the semifinals and placed seventh in the male competition, while Jenny Owens and Katya Cremer came 13th and 15th, all in the top half of the field.\nNordic events.\nAustralia has competed in cross-country skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied the last two places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants in the last two decades have placed in the bottom 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half, finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30 km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the top half in their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the top half in one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.\nSliding events.\nThe first Australian to compete in bobsleigh represented Great Britain. Frederick McEvoy drove the British two-man and four-man bobsleighs in 1936, earning fourth place and a bronze respectively, and carried the British flag at the opening ceremony. Australia first competed in bobsleigh in 1988, and has competed in the event in every Olympics since, except for 2002. Paul Narracott became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics: he competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics, and participated in bobsleigh in 1992 as the brakeman. Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994. They did not compete in skeleton in 2002.\nAustralia competed in all three sports in 2006. In bobsleigh, Australia competed in the two-man and two-woman events, and was the highest-placed country to miss qualifications for an Olympic berth in the four-man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup. The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due to the use of drugs by Armando dos Santos, so that Australia would take its place. Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge, and Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton and placed 22nd. In 2010, Australia was represented by two 2-man bobsleigh teams, Chris Spring with Duncan Harvey, and Jeremy Rolleston with Duncan Pugh. Australia's second Skeleton athlete to complete at an Olympic Games, Anthony Deane, finished 23rd after only 18 months in the sport, while Emma Lincoln-Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively. Until 2010, Australia had placed in the bottom half of the field in every sliding event it has entered, and came last in the luge in 1994. Lincoln-Smith's effort in the skeleton in 2010 changed this record. In 2018, Australia added another two Skeleton athletes to their list of Olympians, John Farrow and Jackie Narracott, finishing 19th and 16th respectfully.\nSpeed skating.\nAustralia has competed in either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964. Australia's Winter Olympic inaugural participant was long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in 1936 and placed in the bottom 25% in all of his four events. Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000 m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later. Until 1968, Hickey's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the top half of their event.\nColin Coates participated in six Winter Olympics, from 1968 to 1988, and came sixth in the 10,000 m event in 1976, Australia's best result before Lillehammer. His four top-11 finishes in 1976 made him only the third Australian to place in the top half of a Winter Olympic event. Before the 1988 Olympics, three other athletes had represented Australia in long track racing, and all had placed near the bottom. In 1988, Danny Kah and Michael Richmond both broke into the top 15 and the top half in two events each, and in 1994, the former recorded Australia's best long track result, finishing fifth in the 5,000 m event. However, Australia did not compete in long track again until 2010, when sole representative Sophie Muir became the first woman to compete for the country in the discipline; she came in the bottom fifth of entrants in both her races.\nShort track speed skating has provided the country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5,000 m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney. However, they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the discipline was introduced and failed to win a medal, and all of the individual competitors finished in the bottom half of the field. They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short track relay yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half in six of their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.\nBradbury won Australia's first winter gold medal in Salt Lake City in 2002, when he was the \"last man standing\" in the 1,000 m event. Five men and Emily Rosemond competed in short track in 2006. Rosemond placed 12th in the 1,000 m, but none of the others managed to pass the first round. From 1994 to 2006, Bradbury (three times in 2002) and Rosemond have been the only two Australians to finish in the top half of the field, and the men's relay team has missed the final on every occasion. In 2010, the sole male racer Lachlan Hay was eliminated in the first round, while the sole female, Tatiana Borodulina made the semifinals in two events, placing 7th and 11th.\nTeam ice sports.\nAustralia has competed once in ice hockey, in 1960. The team lost every game, placing last out of nine countries. Australia has not competed in curling as an official sport at the Olympics, but has competed in it as a demonstration sport, placing seventh in 1992. These are the only times that Australia has competed in team sports involving ball-like objects.\nSnowboarding.\nZeke Steggall—brother of Zali—represented Australia in snowboarding's first two appearances at the Olympics in 1998 and 2002, finishing in the bottom 20% in each of his slalom races. The number of events in the discipline was increased and the 2006 team consisted of nine athletes, who competed in all three events for both men and women.\nThe team representing Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics was Mitchell Allan (halfpipe), Torah Bright (halfpipe), Andrew Burton (halfpipe), Holly Crawford (halfpipe), Damon Hayler (snowboard cross), Ben Mates (halfpipe), Emanuel Oppliger (parallel giant slalom), Johanna Shaw (parallel giant slalom) and Emily Thomas (snowboard cross). Bright came fifth, and Hayler came seventh, and the pair were the only Australians—apart from Oppliger (15th)—to finish in the top half of their respective events. In 2010, Bright returned and won gold. After falling in her first run in the final—only the highest of the two runs is counted—she had to perform her second run before all the other competitors as she was ranked last after the first phase, and produced the top-score, which the others could not match. Crawford came eighth in the final. Australia's two male competitors Mates and Scott James finished in the middle of the field and missed the finals. In the snowboard cross, Hayler came tenth, while Alex Pullin was fastest in the qualification time trial, but crashed in the first round of racing, while the sole female racer Stephanie Hickey finished near bottom. Shaw was again Australia's sole slalom racer, and ended in the bottom half.\nAustralia at the Winter Paralympics.\nAustralia has competed in every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976. Their sole participant in 1976 was Ron Finneran, although he was not an official entrant. In 1980, alpine and cross-country skier Kyrra Grunnsund and cross-country skier Peter Rickards became the first official competitors for Australia. The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all of the athletes were alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then. All of the medals have been won in alpine skiing.\nAustralia won four medals in 1992—one gold, one silver and two bronze. Michael Milton, an amputee alpine skier, won gold in the slalom and silver in the super-G. In paraplegic sit-skiing, David Munk won bronze in the super-G, and Michael Norton won bronze in the downhill. In 1994, Australia won three gold, two silver and four bronze medals. Milton won gold in the giant slalom, silver in the slalom and bronze in the downhill and super-G, and Norton won gold in the slalom and super-G. James Patterson, a skier with cerebral palsy, won silver in the downhill and bronze in the giant slalom. Munk won another bronze, this time in the giant slalom. In 1998, Australia won two medals, both through Paterson: gold in the downhill and bronze in the slalom.\nIn 2002, Australia's medal count consisted of six golds and one silver. Milton swept his disability class, winning gold in the downhill, super-G, giant slalom and slalom. Bart Bunting, a vision-impaired skier guided by Nathan Chivers, won gold in the downhill and super-G, and silver in the giant slalom.\nIn 2006, Emily Jansen, a leg amputee alpine skier, became Australia's first female Winter Paralympian. James Millar, born without his right forearm, competed in the cross-country and the biathlon, becoming the first Australian to compete in an event outside alpine skiing. Milton attended his last Paralympics, but did not win a medal. A target of two medals was set, which took into account the merging of several disability classes. Australia met this target, as Milton won silver in the downhill and Toby Kane won bronze in the super-G. In 2010, Australia won a silver and three bronze medals, all in alpine skiing. Jessica Gallagher became the first Australian woman to win a medal, taking bronze in the slalom for the visually impaired. Cameron Rahles Rabula won bronze in both the slalom and super combined."

        "title": "Derek Anderson (American football)",
        "text": "Derek Matthew Anderson (born June 15, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers. Anderson was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL draft. A 2007 Pro Bowler, he also played for the Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals, Carolina Panthers, and the Buffalo Bills.\nEarly years.\nAnderson grew up in Scappoose, Oregon, where he led the Scappoose Indians football team to one of their record three consecutive state football championships in Class 3A football. He excelled at basketball and was named state player of the year in both football and basketball his senior year. He participated in the first ever U.S. Army All-American Bowl game in 2000. He was a childhood friend and schoolmate of Playboy Playmate Sara Jean Underwood.\nCollege career.\nA Beaver fan growing up, Anderson wanted to play for Oregon State most of his life, and his decision as a top national prospect to play for the Beavers was celebrated by fans.\nAt 6-feet-6-inches, many believed Anderson would play basketball in college. Despite his stature, Anderson was highly recruited nationally for football, especially after his dominating senior year performance in high school as quarterback.\nFreshman season (2001).\nAs a freshman in the 2001 season, Anderson appeared in five games and recorded 263 passing yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.\nSophomore season (2002).\nAnderson's early entry as the starting quarterback came on the heels of Oregon State's most successful period to date. Capped by a crushing 41–9 Fiesta Bowl win over Notre Dame, the team went 11–1 in 2000 and ranked 4th in the nation under head coach Dennis Erickson. Following the breakthrough season, fan expectations were exceptionally high in 2002 for the Oregon State program to pick up where they left off.\nUnfortunately, Oregon State had lost the majority of its star players to the NFL in 2001 and the inexperienced Anderson was handed the reins of a team many overestimated and believed would again crack the top 25. However, the team's youth was easily apparent from the start and led to a string of early losses. Still, Anderson and the team's performance rapidly improved and the Beavers recorded an 8–5 season. He and the team's work was good enough to give them entry into the 2002 Insight Bowl, against the University of Pittsburgh. Oregon State lost 38–13 and coach Erickson left for an NFL head-coaching position with the San Francisco 49ers. \nEven though it was clear Anderson was unprepared for a starting position as a sophomore, he had no serious competition at the quarterback position and his job remained secure through the following season.\nJunior season (2003).\nPressures on the team to repeat the program's 2000 performance were compounded by the coaching change at the end of 2002–2003. The return of previous head coach Mike Riley from the NFL meant learning an entirely new system. With help from teammate and star running back Steven Jackson, Anderson again rose to the occasion and played a leading role in propelling the team to an 8–5 record, capped by a 55–14 Las Vegas Bowl win over a then up-and-coming New Mexico program.\nSenior season (2004).\nThroughout the 2004 season, Anderson surprised many defenses with his ability to escape the tackle and run the ball effectively. He became a dual-threat quarterback and began showing a true command of the game by his improvisation in the pocket and successful outlet passing when under duress. Although the team's 7–5 performance was far from spectacular, Anderson became nationally recognized as a dangerous offensive weapon who could strike long gains at will. The Beavers were without Steven Jackson, who was drafted into the NFL the previous spring. Even without the star running back, Anderson led his team back to the Insight Bowl where they again faced Notre Dame (led by Anderson's future Browns teammate Brady Quinn). The Beavers never trailed in the game and defeated the Irish 38–21. Anderson passed for 359 yards and had four touchdown passes with no interceptions.\nAnderson is the fourth player in Pac-10 history to throw for over 4,000 yards in a single season, setting an Oregon State record at 4,058 yards in the 2003 season. He ranks second in the Pac-10 for career touchdown passes, at 79 (also an Oregon State record). He is the 6th person ever to throw for 10,000 yards in a career in the Pac-10.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nAnderson was selected out of Oregon State University by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL draft (213th overall). He never played for them and was waived on September 20, 2005.\nCleveland Browns.\n2005 season.\nAnderson was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Browns the day after being waived by the Ravens. He did not see any action, being third on the depth chart behind Trent Dilfer and Charlie Frye.\n2006 season.\nAnderson served as Frye's backup for the Cleveland Browns in 2006 season. He made his NFL debut against the Denver Broncos at Cleveland Browns Stadium, on October 22, taking one snap after Frye was briefly shaken up. His second NFL appearance was more noteworthy. After Frye injured his wrist during the first half of Cleveland's December 3 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Anderson played the entire second half. He threw his first two NFL touchdowns in that game, connecting with tight end Steve Heiden twice in the fourth quarter. Anderson scrambled for 33 yards in overtime, moving the ball from the Kansas City 45-yard line to the 12-yard line, after which the Browns were in field goal range. His play was instrumental in leading the Browns back from a 28–14 deficit to a 31–28 overtime victory. \nOverall, Anderson appeared in five games and recorded 793 passing yards, five touchdowns, and eight interceptions in the 2006 season.\n2007 season.\nAlthough some reports said he outplayed incumbent starter Frye and rookie Brady Quinn in minicamp, Anderson was not as productive in the pre-season games and Frye was named the starter for the 2007 season. Head coach Romeo Crennel earlier said that the two were so close in effectiveness that he would use a coin toss to decide which quarterback would start the first preseason game. Anderson would take over for Frye in the 2007 opener after Frye was ineffective in the first quarter against the Browns' archrival, the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was Frye's last in a Browns uniform, as he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft pick two days later. Named the starting quarterback by Crennel for Week 2, Anderson threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns against the Cincinnati Bengals in his first start. His passer rating for the game was 121.0 as the Browns defeated the Bengals 51–45, solidifying Anderson's role. In the same game, Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer threw for six touchdown passes. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game.\nOn September 30, Anderson beat the team that drafted him, the Baltimore Ravens. He threw for two touchdowns and 204 yards, completing 10 of 18 pass attempts with just one interception. The Browns would later beat the Ravens again, making it the first time since 2001 that the Browns were able to sweep the Ravens.\nIn Week 13 of the 2007 season, the Browns faced the Arizona Cardinals. Down 27–21 late in the 4th, the Browns drove down to the Cardinals 34-yard line. On fourth down, Anderson threw a pass to the end zone which was caught by Kellen Winslow II. The pass was ruled out of bounds and held up through review. Anderson argued that Winslow was forced out, but the force-out rule was not reviewable. The game was notable for the officials' missed call of a Braylon Edwards catch and tackle by contact, but mistakenly ruled a touchdown as Edwards got up and ran to the endzone.\nAnother close game that could have put the Browns in the playoffs was December 23 against the Bengals, in which the Browns went scoreless in the first half, but held the Bengals scoreless in the second half. Anderson had four interceptions, two of them on consecutive plays, and one more in the Cincinnati end zone as Cleveland appeared to be heading for a scoring drive. The Browns also had two turnover-on-downs possessions. Anderson threw two touchdown passes to Braylon Edwards, Cleveland's only scores in the game. The game ended in a 19–14 loss.\nAnderson led the Browns to a 10–6 overall record, 10–5 in games in which he started. Anderson finished with 29 touchdowns to 19 interceptions. During the week of December 12–18, Anderson was named as a first alternate for the 2008 Pro Bowl at quarterback. On February 4, Tom Brady announced he would not be attending the Pro Bowl due to injury. This paved the way for Anderson to make his first and only appearance in the Pro Bowl. The PFWA named Anderson as their Most Improved Player.\n2008 season.\nOn February 29, 2008, the first day of free agency, after speculation that Anderson would leave Cleveland to pursue a bigger contract, Anderson agreed to a three-year contract to stay with the Browns through the 2010 season. With fans split between the proven Anderson and the locally-homegrown Quinn (an image of Quinn wearing a Bernie Kosar jersey as a kid was shown at the 2007 NFL draft), many were speculating if the Browns were in a similar position the San Diego Chargers were in a few years back with Drew Brees and their first-round pick Philip Rivers.\nThe 2008 season was a tough one for the Browns and Anderson. In the preseason, he suffered a concussion when he was sacked by Osi Umenyiora of the New York Giants. This would prevent him from practicing for the majority of the preseason. In the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys, he was 11-of-24 for 110 yards and a touchdown. On November 3, after starting out the season the Browns announced that Anderson would be benched in favor of Quinn. On November 23, during a game against the Houston Texans, Quinn was benched by Crennel in favor of Anderson. On November 25, Quinn was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a broken finger and Anderson was renamed the starting quarterback. On November 30, Anderson was injured during a game versus the Indianapolis Colts. It was later revealed to be an MCL injury, which put Anderson out for the season. Ken Dorsey came into the starting role, but could not save the Browns. The Browns lost the last four games to finish with a 4–12 record.\n2009 season.\nIn the 2009 season, Anderson continued to compete with Quinn. He appeared in eight games for the Browns. He finished with 888 passing yards, three touchdowns, and ten interceptions. The Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. Anderson would wind up being one of the most productive quarterbacks for Cleveland, statistically, and that legacy lasted over the franchise's next nine years as he ranked the third-best QB overall between 2000 and 2018.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn March 17, 2010, Anderson signed a two-year deal worth $7.25 million with the Arizona Cardinals. After Kurt Warner retired and Matt Leinart was released, Anderson became the starting quarterback for the Cardinals. After struggling in his first few games, Anderson was benched in favor of rookie Max Hall on October 6. Anderson was named the starting quarterback again for the November 7 game against the Minnesota Vikings after Hall struggled. However, in week 14 he was benched again after suffering a concussion and was replaced with Hall, whose season ended with a separated shoulder later in the game. Rookie John Skelton finished the game and succeeded Anderson as the Cardinals' starting quarterback. Anderson also created a notable soundbite after being caught on national TV laughing with teammate Deuce Lutui while he and his team were playing poorly. His subsequent anger toward the reporter who kept questioning him on the subject made national news and was featured on several sports shows. Anderson was released by the Cardinals on July 28, 2011.\nCarolina Panthers.\nAnderson signed with the Carolina Panthers on July 31, 2011. He served as the backup to quarterback Cam Newton and played only a few times for Carolina either to end the game or play for an injured Newton.\nOn September 7, 2014, Anderson made his first start since 2010 after Newton suffered an injury which held him out. In the game, Anderson completed 24 of 34 passes for 230 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, leading the Panthers to a 20–14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Anderson would have his second start of the season after Newton was involved in a car accident, coincidentally also against the Buccaneers. Anderson finished the game by completing 25 of 40 passes for 277 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions, helping the Panthers win 19–17.\nOn February 7, 2016, Anderson was part of the Panthers team that played in Super Bowl 50. In the game, Anderson served as Cam Newton's active-backup as the Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24–10.\nIn Week 4 of the 2016 season against the Atlanta Falcons, Anderson entered the game after an injury to Newton and threw for 172 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Panthers lost by a score of 48–33. Due to Newton's injury, Anderson started the Week 5 game against the Buccaneers and threw for 278 yards and two interceptions as the Panthers lost by a score of 17–14. In Week 13 against the Seattle Seahawks, Anderson made his second start of the season. He threw an interception on the Panthers first play on offense and was then replaced by Newton. Anderson started the game due to Newton having violated the team's dress code. Anderson came into the 2017 NFC on January 7, 2018, against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter after Newton went down with an injury. He had one pass attempt in the 31–26 defeat.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn October 7, 2018, it was announced Anderson would sign with the Buffalo Bills, reuniting with Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane from his days playing for the Carolina Panthers, to serve as backup and mentor to rookie quarterback Josh Allen. The Bills completed the transaction on October 9.\nOn October 17, following an injury to Allen and a poor performance by backup quarterback Nathan Peterman in relief, Anderson was named the Week 7 starter for the Bills against the Indianapolis Colts. During the game, Anderson threw for 175 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions in a 37–5 loss. With Allen still injured, Anderson made the start the following week against the New England Patriots. He threw for 290 yards, no touchdowns, and one interception before leaving the game in the fourth quarter. He was put into concussion protocol and ruled out for the Week 9 game against the Chicago Bears, and Peterman was named the starter once again.\nOn December 31, 2018, Anderson signed a one-year contract extension with the Bills.\nRetirement.\nOn May 9, 2019, Anderson announced his retirement from the NFL. He later attributed his retirement to lingering effects from the 2018 concussion; he remains in regular contact with Allen and approved of the hiring of his (Anderson's) friend Ken Dorsey as quarterbacks coach."

        "text": "Orlando Claude Brown Sr. (November 12, 1970 – September 23, 2011) was an American football player who played offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns. He attended Howard D. Woodson High School. He played college football for Willie Jeffries at South Carolina State University. He was nicknamed \"Zeus\".\nEarly years.\nBrown was born in 1970 in Washington, D.C. Brown attended H. D. Woodson Senior High School. He went to South Carolina State University and played offensive tackle.\nNFL career.\nCleveland Browns.\nBrown signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 1993. He spent three seasons with the Browns.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nIn 1996, the Browns franchise was moved by owner Art Modell to Baltimore, becoming the Baltimore Ravens. In his first stint as a Raven, Brown who, at 6-foot-7, 360 pounds, was known as an energetic and intimidating player, earned the nickname \"Zeus\". In his prime he was one of the highest-paid offensive linemen in the NFL.\nSecond stint with Browns.\nBrown was signed as an unrestricted free agent by the \"reactivated\" Cleveland Browns before the 1999 season. During a December 19, 1999, game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Brown was hit in the right eye by a penalty flag weighted with ball bearings thrown by referee Jeff Triplette. Triplette immediately apologized to Brown. Brown left the game temporarily, then returned to the field only to shove Triplette, knocking him to the ground. Brown was ejected from the game and had to be escorted off the field by his teammates. Brown was subsequently suspended by the NFL, but the suspension was lifted when the severity of his injury became apparent. Brown missed three seasons due to temporary blindness. Brown was one of only two players to have played for the original Cleveland Browns and the Browns after the team was revived in 1999, as most of the Browns roster was moved to Baltimore. The other player is Antonio Langham.\nOut of football, injuries, and lawsuits.\nBrown sat out the entire 2000 NFL season waiting for his right eye to heal; he spent time on the physically unable to perform list before Cleveland released him three weeks into the regular season. \nIn 2001, he sued the NFL for $200 million in damages. According to reports, he settled for a sum between $15 million and $25 million in 2002.\nSecond stint with Ravens.\nBrown spent the 2001 and 2002 seasons in rehabilitation before he was picked back up by the Ravens in 2003. During the 2003 season, Brown started at both offensive and defensive tackle in a game against the Oakland Raiders. He remained with the team until being released in March 2006. Following his retirement, Brown retained ties with the Ravens and mentored players.\nAfter football.\nAfter retiring from football, Brown went into the restaurant business, and became the owner of the first Fatburger franchise in Maryland.\nIn September 2009, Brown was arrested and charged with third-degree burglary and destruction of property. The charges were later dropped.\nDeath.\nBrown was found dead on September 23, 2011, in his Baltimore townhouse. The state medical examiner ruled that Brown died of diabetic ketoacidosis, an ailment common among diabetics and caused by high blood sugar and lack of insulin.\nPersonal life.\nBrown had three sons and two daughters. One son, Orlando Jr., plays in the National Football League."

        "title": "Anthony Wright (American football)",
        "text": "Anthony Lavon Wright (born February 14, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals and New York Giants. He played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks.\nEarly years.\nWright attended West Craven High School, where he played as a quarterback. As a senior, he was named All-state, SuperPrep All-American and Gatorade Player-of-the-Year. He finished his high school career with 4,890 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.\nCollege career.\nWright accepted a football scholarship from the University of South Carolina. As a redshirt freshman, he was a backup behind Steve Taneyhill, making 17 out of 27 completions for 207 yards, 2 touchdowns and one interception. As a sophomore, he became a starter after Taneyhill graduated, posting 1,850 passing yards, 8 passing touchdowns, 3 interceptions, 90 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns.\nAs a junior, he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee against the University of Tennessee, missing the final two games of the season. He had 1,685 passing yards, a school record 18 passing touchdowns, 5 interceptions, 44 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.\nAs a senior, head coach Brad Scott platooned him with freshman Phil Petty, but still recorded 1,899 passing yards, 10 passing touchdowns, 10 interceptions, 56 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns. He left as the school's fifth all-time passer, leading the school to a 12–21 record over the three years he was the starter, including one winning campaign and a 1–10 record in his last season.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nWright was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 1999 NFL Draft. He made such a good impression in preseason that the team made the unusual move keeping him as the fourth-string quarterback, behind Kordell Stewart, Mike Tomczak, and Pete Gonzalez. On August 27, 2000, he was waived after being passed on the depth chart by rookie Tee Martin.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn August 30, 2000, Wright was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to their practice squad. Even though he hadn't played in an NFL regular season game, he was scouted in a preseason game between the Cowboys and the Steelers.\nIn November, he was promoted to the active roster after backup quarterback Randall Cunningham was injured. On December 10, when Troy Aikman suffered a concussion playing against the Washington Redskins, Wright played the remaining three quarters in a 32–13 win. Although he had attempted only 5 passes (3 completions) in the previous game, he was given the start in the next game against the New York Giants, which resulted in a 17–13 loss. He would also start the final game of the season against the Tennessee Titans, which resulted in a 31–0 loss after he had three critical turnovers in the third quarter.\nIn 2001, he became the backup quarterback after Tony Banks was cut. When starter Quincy Carter injured his throwing thumb, Wright became his replacement and started on September 23 against the San Diego Chargers, but had two costly turnovers in a 21–32 loss. The next week he started in an 18–40 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles, in which he was ineffective. On October 7, he replaced an injured Carter but the team still lost 21–28 against the Oakland Raiders. The next week he started on Monday Night Football and contributed to a 9–7 win against Tony Banks and the Washington Redskins. Having a chronic right knee injury, he decided to have his knee scoped to repair the cartilage damage, forcing him to sit the rest of the season. The Cowboys would use a combination of Clint Stoerner and Ryan Leaf as the starters until Carter recovered from a torn hamstring, starting a franchise-high four quarterbacks in a season.\nHead coach Dave Campo released Wright from the team on September 1, 2002, following the acquisition of quarterback Chad Hutchinson during the offseason, while stating that Stoerner was better suited for the third-string quarterback role, in light of Wright's ambition to be a starter.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nWright was signed by the Baltimore Ravens to their practice squad in 2002. After first round draft choice Kyle Boller injured his thigh in a game against the St. Louis Rams, Wright was activated from the practice squad on October 15.\nAfter the Ravens lost to the Miami Dolphins in his first start 6–9, Wright led a spectacular comeback against the Seahawks; with the score tied at three in the final minute of the first half, the Seahawks scored two quick touchdowns, and stormed to a 41–24 lead with seven minutes remaining, but Wright erupted with four touchdown throws and 319 passing yards in a 44–41 overtime triumph. Ravens head coach Brian Billick gave the game ball to Wright's wife, for waiting until after the contest to induce labor.\nThe Ravens won five of their last six games with Wright posting a 5–2 record and having a critical role in the team reaching the playoffs, where they lost a close game against the Tennessee Titans with a score of 20–17, with the difference being a 46-yard field goal with 29 seconds left. He finished the season with 1,199 passing yards, 9 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.\nWright missed the 2004 season after having surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Following another injury to Boller during the first game of the 2005 season, he was named the starting quarterback, but was again demoted after having a 2–5 record.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nWith the departure of Carson Palmer's former backup quarterback Jon Kitna to the Detroit Lions, Wright signed a one-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals on April 21, 2006, winning a competition with Craig Krenzel and Doug Johnson for the backup job.\nNew York Giants.\nOn April 13, 2007, he signed as a free agent with the New York Giants, throwing him into a four-quarterback scramble for roster spots with Eli Manning, Tim Hasselbeck, and Jared Lorenzen. He was named the third-string quarterback in a season that saw the team win Super Bowl XLII, beating the previously undefeated New England Patriots.\nOn August 18, 2008, Wright suffered a back injury in a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns and was eventually placed on the injured reserve list on August 30. He wasn't re-signed the next season and decided to announce his retirement.\nPersonal life.\nWright has had two cousins play in the NFL, Jesse Campbell who played safety from 1991 to 1998, and Justin Hardy who played wide receiver from 2015 to 2021.\nWright was shot multiple times after an argument on July 1, 2019, in Concord, North Carolina. He underwent emergency surgery to treat his injuries."

        "title": "1952 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1952 Tour de France was the 39th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 25 June to 19 July. It was composed of 23 stages over . Newly introduced were the arrivals on mountain peaks.\nThe race was won by Italian Fausto Coppi. Coppi dominated the race, winning five stages and the mountains classification, and was a member of the winning Italian team. His dominance was so large that the Tour organisation had to double the prize money for second place to make the race interesting. At the end, Coppi had a margin of almost half an hour over the second-ranked cyclist; such a margin has never been achieved again. Although more than 25 years later during the 1979 edition, the 1st and 2nd-place finishers Bernard Hinault and Joop Zoetemelk were both nearly a half hour ahead of the 3rd-place finisher.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1952 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1952, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 12 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 8 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg (together with Australia), Netherlands and Spain. The French regional cyclists were divided into four teams of 12 cyclists: Paris, North-East/Centre, South-East and West/South-West. The last team of eight cyclists was made up out of cyclists from the French North African colonies. In the end, Luxembourg only sent 6 cyclists, so altogether this made 122 cyclists. There were 57 French (of which 6 were Algerian), 13 Italian, 12 Belgian, 8 Dutch, 8 Spanish, 8 Swiss, 5 Luxembourgian and 1 Australian cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winners of the last two editions, Swiss cyclists Hugo Koblet and Ferdinand Kübler, were injured and did not enter the race, nor did French cyclist Louison Bobet. On the last press conference before the race, Jacques Goddet conducted a poll amongst journalists to see who they considered the favourite. Coppi received 29 votes in that poll, followed by Géminiani and Bartali, both with 26 votes.\nRoute and stages.\nThe final stage was from Vichy, the capital of Vichy France in the Second World War, to Paris. Vichy had never before been visited, and the distance from Vichy to Paris was significantly longer than the other stages. A newspaper described it as linking the two cities together. The stop in Vichy was successful, with a new record of 150.000 live spectators. An innovation was the stage arrivals on mountain peaks. This happened three times in 1952, on stages 10, 11 and 21. There were two rest days, in Alpe d'Huez and Toulouse. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 11.\nRace overview.\nIn the fourth stage, Jean Robic, the winner of the 1947 Tour de France was in a group with his teammate Raphaël Géminiani, and Robic let Géminiani do all the work. After the stage, Robic told reporters that he had been smart, because he had saved energy and was in a better position to win the Tour. Géminiani then became angry and held Robic's head in a hotel room sink. It was the last year that Robic rode on the national team. At that moment, Nello Lauredi was the leader in the race.\nIn the sixth stage, Fiorenzo Magni escaped, and became the leader of the general classification by twelve seconds. In the 1950 Tour de France, Magni had already become the leader, but left the race without riding in the yellow jersey.\nIn the time trial in stage seven, won by Fausto Coppi, Magni lost his lead, and Lauredi became leader again.\nThe first high mountains appeared in stage eight. Magni and Lauredi stayed together, but because Magni took a twenty-second bonification for finishing second, they swapped positions again, and Magni became leader again.\nIn the ninth stage, a group of eight cyclists got away, including Coppi's teammate Andrea Carrea. At the end of the stage, the group had a margin of more than nine minutes. Carrea went to the hotel after the finish, but was picked up by the police. Carrea asked what he had done wrong, but he was told that he was the new leader of the race, and had to go to the ceremony to receive the yellow jersey. Carrea apologised to his team leader Coppi, in fear that his team leader would be angry because a helper occupied the highest rank, but Coppi was not angry.\nIn the tenth stage, Robic attacked, and only Coppi was able to follow him. Later, Robic had a flat tire. Because his team director was far away, he lost several minutes, and lost so much time that he dropped from second place to fifth place. Coppi rode away and won the stage, taking over the lead in the general classification from his teammate. The top three riders were all Italian at that moment.\nAfter the rest day, the eleventh stage was again a mountain stage. The cyclists from the French national team, especially Géminiani, attacked on the Galibier, but Coppi counterattacked and escaped easily. At the end of the stage, Coppi won by a large margin. His lead in the general classification was now almost 20 minutes.\nThe margin was so large that Coppi didn't need to attack in the twelfth stage. When Coppi had a flat tire, his teammate Gino Bartali gave him his own wheel, which was a sign that the rivalry between the two cyclists was over. Even though Coppi rode conservatively in that stage, the cyclist directly behind him in the general classification, Alex Close, lost another four minutes, and Coppi was now 24 minutes ahead.\nThe Tour organisation feared that the race would become dull, now that Coppi's lead was so large. Therefore, they doubled the prize money for second and third place, hoping to keep the other cyclists aggressive.\nIn the sixteenth stage, the riders were apparently not motivated by the double prize money, as they were slow that day. The organisation then responded by canceling the prize money; there was still a rule from before 1947, that said that stage winners had to go at least 30 km/h to win prize money. The winner, André Rosseel, had only reached 29 km/h.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Géminiani, who was already in fourteenth place, 52 minutes behind in the general classification, escaped. Coppi did not chase him, and allowed Géminiani to win the stage.\nIn the eighteenth stage, Coppi reached the top of the mountains first, but took it easy on the descent, and allowed other cyclists to get back to him. He still won the sprint at the end of the stage.\nCoppi also won the last mountain stage, stage 21, and increased his lead to more than 31 minutes. In the time trial on the next day, Coppi apparently took it easy. Previously he was an expert in such time trials, but on that day he allowed other cyclists to win back some time, and finished on the fourteenth place.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 123 cyclists that started the 1951 Tour de France, 66 finished the race.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was the same as in 1951: there were three types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the winner, the easier ones in category 2 gave 6 points to the winner, and the easiest in category 3 gave 3 points. Fausto Coppi won this classification.\nThe team classification had been awarded and calculated since 1930, but in 1952 the daily team classification was also calculated: for each stage, the best team (calculated as the team of which the best three cyclists had the lowest accumulated team in that stage) received a prize. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps for the first time in 1952. It was won by the Italian team. The Luxembourgian team finished with only two cyclists, and therefore were not eligible for the team classification.\nThe 1952 Tour de France saw the introduction of the combativity award, a daily award for the most combative rider of the stage. The winner of that award received 100,000 French francs. The super-combativity award, the award for the most combative rider of the entire Tour de France, was also first given in 1953, determined by a jury vote, to Robic. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier stage 11. This prize was won by Fausto Coppi. The special award for the best regional rider was won by eighteenth-placed Marcel Zelasco.\nThere were also a few minor awards. After every stage, an award was given to the cyclist with the most bad luck, and to the most 'cold-blooded' cyclist. At the end of the Tour the award for the cyclist with the most bad luck was given to Wim van Est. The award for most beloved cyclist was given to Antonin Rolland.\nAftermath.\nThe daily combativity award was a success, and has been awarded ever since. The mountain finishes also were spectacular enough to have been included in every Tour de France since.\nFausto Coppi would never start the Tour de France again.\nThe team selectors for the French national team felt that Raphaël Géminiani had held back when chasing Fausto Coppi, because they rode for the same sponsor. For that reason, Géminiani was left out the national team for the 1952 UCI Road World Championships. To avoid these problems in the future, Géminiani switched teams at the end of the season."

        "title": "1962 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1962 Tour de France was the 49th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race consisted of 22 stages, including two split stages, starting in Nancy on 24 June and finishing at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 15 July. There were four time trial stages and no rest days. After more than 30 years, the Tour was again contested by trade teams instead of national teams. Jacques Anquetil of the team won the overall general classification, defending his title to win his third Tour de France. Jef Planckaert () placed second, 4min 59s in arrears, and Raymond Poulidor () was third, over ten minutes behind Anquetil.\nAnquetil's teammate Rudi Altig took the first general classification leader's yellow jersey after winning the first stage. He lost it the following day to André Darrigade of , who won stage 2a, before regaining it after winning stage three. The lead was taken by Saint-Raphaël rider Albertus Geldermans after stage six. He held it for two stages, before Darrigade took it back for the next two. Flandria rider Willy Schroeders then led the race between the end of stage nine to the end of eleven, at which point Schroeders' teammate Rik Van Looy, a major pre-race favourite, abandoned the race with an injury. The following day, British rider Tom Simpson (Gitane–Leroux) became the first rider from outside mainland Europe in history to wear the yellow jersey. He lost it to Planckaert after stage thirteen's individual time trial to Superbagnères in the Pyrenees. He held the lead for seven stages, which included the Alps. Anquetil's victory in the individual time trial of stage twenty put him in the yellow jersey, which he held until the conclusion of the race.\nIn the other race classifications, Altig won the points classification and Federico Bahamontes () won the mountains classification. Saint-Raphaël won the team classification. The overall awards for most combative and unluckiest were given to Eddy Pauwels () and Van Looy respectively. Altig and Emile Daems () won the most stages, with three each.\nTeams.\nFrom 1930 to 1961, the Tour de France was contested by national teams, but in 1962 commercially sponsored international trade teams returned. From the late-1950s to 1962, the Tour had seen the absence of top riders who had bowed to pressure from their teams' \"extra-sportif\" (non-cycling industry) sponsors to ride other races that better suited their brands. This, and a demand for wider advertising from a declining bicycle industry, led to the reintroduction of the trade team format.\nIn early February 1962, 22 teams submitted applications for the race, with the final list of 15 announced at the end of the month. The Spanish-based was the first choice reserve team. Each of the 15 teams consisted of 10 cyclists (150 total), an increase from the 1961 Tour, which had 11 teams of 12 cyclists (132 total). Each team was required to have a dominant nationality; at least six cyclists should have the same nationality, or only two nationalities should be present. For the first time, French cyclists were outnumbered; the largest numbers of riders from a nation came from Italy (52), with the next largest coming from France (50) and Belgium (28). Riders represented a further six nations, all European.\nOf the start list of 150, 66 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 27.5 years, ranging from 21-year-old Tiziano Galvanin () to 40-year-old Pino Cerami (). The cyclists had the youngest average age (25.2) while cyclists had the oldest (30). The presentation of the teams where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries took place outside the in Nancy before the start of the opening stage in the city.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nMajority of French cyclists\nMajority of Italian cyclists\nMajority of Belgian cyclists\nPre-race favourites.\nThe leading contender for the overall general classification before the Tour was the defending champion Jacques Anquetil of the Saint-Raphaël team. His closest rivals were thought to be Rik Van Looy (Flandria) and Raymond Poulidor (Mercier). The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Rudi Altig (Saint-Raphaël), Charly Gaul (Gazzola), Federico Bahamontes (Margnat), Gastone Nencini (Ignis), Henry Anglade (Liberia), Guido Carlesi (Philco), Tom Simpson (Gitane–Leroux), Ercole Baldini (Ignis) and Hans Junkermann (). Of these, three were former winners of the Tour: Gaul (1958), Bahamontes (1959) and Nencini (1960).\nFrenchman Anquetil, who also won the Tour in 1957, had dominated the 1961 Tour, leading it from the first day to the last, with a winning margin of over twelve minutes. Less than two months before the 1962 Tour, Anquetil had withdrawn from the Vuelta a España, the previous Grand Tour, before the final stage due to viral hepatitis. Although he was the team leader, he was 32nd in the general classification at the time of his withdrawal, while his teammate Altig won the race. Observers expected some internal team struggle in the Tour due to a possible rivalry between the pair over leadership. After recovering for ten days, Anquetil went against his doctor's orders and rode the week-long stage race Critérium du Dauphiné, finishing seventh overall. Anquetil's former bitter rival Raphaël Géminiani was then selected as the team manager of Saint-Raphaël for the Tour. Unhappy, Anquetil asked his sponsors to replace Géminiani; they declined his request.\nVan Looy, the winner of the previous two world road race championships, made his Tour debut in 1962. He had avoided riding the Tour because he thought he did not have the full support of the Belgium team, but with Flandria he had control over rider selection. He had a successful season leading up to the Tour, winning the one-day classics Paris–Roubaix, the Tour of Flanders and Gent–Wevelgem, and two stages of the Giro d'Italia Grand Tour. He crashed during training four days before the Tour which caused a muscular stretch in his left thigh. Although Van Looy was known as a one-day classics specialist, he was considered a threat to Anquetil, who himself named Van Looy as the only rider who concerned him, fearing the high number of \"flat\" stage wins could potentially add up to eight minutes due to the one minute bonuses given to stage winners. A \"duel\" between him and Anquetil was billed by the press.\nPoulidor was in his third year as a professional, and was more popular in his home country than his compatriot Anquetil. In 1961, he won the national road race championship and Milan–San Remo one-day classic. It was his first appearance in the Tour; he did not ride the 1961 race on the advice of his trade team manager, Antonin Magne, who did not want him riding as a domestique for Anquetil and undermining his 'commercial value'. Anquetil dismissed the media's prediction that Poulidor was his rival, saying: \"All Poulidor does is follow. He never takes the initiative.\" In training in the lead up to the Tour, Poulidor broke his left little finger and began the race with a cast on his forearm.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1962 Tour was announced on 14 December 1961. Notable features of the route were the absence of rest days and four time trial events over a total of , which was unusually high, more than in the previous Tour. Anquetil said he did not fear the mountains and that although the time trials favoured him, he would not object if they were not included. Both Van Looy and Gaston Nencini complained about the number of time trials. Van Looy threatened not to ride, feeling it was too hard, and the time trials did not suit him, saying \"Four times, you are crazy. Why not a normal route? I will not start this Tour. I do not intend to play for three weeks.\"\nThe opening stage (known as the \"Grand Départ\") started in Nancy, in north-eastern France. The stage passed through Luxembourg and ended in the Belgian town of Spa. Belgium hosted stages 2a, and 2b, in Herentals, and the beginning of the third in Brussels. This stage brought the race into northern France with the finish in Amiens. Stage four headed to the coast, westwards to Le Havre, with the following two stages taking the Tour along a coastal route to the western tip of the country. Stages seven to ten formed a continuous journey along the west coast to the foot of the Pyrenees at Bayonne. The Pyrenees hosted the next four stages, with the fourteenth finishing in Carcassonne. Stages fifteen to seventeen took the race to the south-east at Antibes. Stage eighteen headed north to Briançon, in the Alps. The nineteenth stage moved the race out of the mountains and down to Aix-les-Bains. The final three stages took the Tour back to the north through Lyon and Nevers to finish at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris.\nThere were 22 stages in the race, including two split stages, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 1961 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the 22nd at , and stage 2a was the shortest at . Of the four time trial stages, three (8b, 13, and 20) were individual time trial events and one (2b) a team time trial. There was only one summit finish, in stage 13's time trial to the Superbagnères ski resort. On stage 18, the climb to the summit of the Cime de la Bonette Alpine mountain, including the Col de Restefond and Col de la Bonette passes, was used for the first time in the Tour in 1962. At an altitude of , it is one of the highest paved roads in Europe and the highest point of elevation reached in the history of the Tour (as of 2018). The Bonette was among six first-category rated climbs in the race. The Tour included four new start or finish locations: Spa, in stages 1and2; Herentals, in stages 2a and 2b; Luçon, in stages 8a and 8b; and Nevers, in stages 21 and 22. In 1962, the final of each stage of the Tour was broadcast live on television for the first time.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\".\nIn the opening stage, a 23-man breakaway group of riders escaped the peloton (main group) as they passed Luxembourg City with remaining. They stayed away and came to the finish over six minutes ahead, with Rudi Altig winning the sprint, and taking the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Rik Van Looy, third on the stage, was denied the opportunity to wear the yellow jersey in his own country and into his home town of Herentals at the end of the following stage. Of the pre-race favourites, Raymond Poulidor, Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes were not present in the lead group. Altig also took the points classification's green jersey, and Liberia rider Jean Selic led the mountains classification.\nThe first part of the second stage ended with a bunch sprint won by André Darrigade of Gitane–Leroux. Van Looy escaped close to the end but took a wrong turn; he placed fourth. Darrigade, second previously, took the yellow and green jerseys, with Angelino Soler of Ghigi taking the lead of the mountains classification. The team time trial in Herentals later in the day was won by Flandria; their winning margin over second-place Gitane–Leroux was 1min 15s, and moved four of their riders into the top ten. Altig retook the yellow jersey in stage three's sprint from a breakaway consisting of 41 riders. Gaul and Bahamontes lost further time, finishing in the peloton over five minutes in arrears.\nNorth and west coasts.\nIn the fourth stage, Mercier's Willy Vanden Berghen won the sprint finish between a group of six that went clear with around to go. Altig reclaimed the green jersey. Stage five ended in a bunch sprint won by Philco rider Emile Daems, with Gitane–Leroux's Rolf Wolfshohl taking the lead of the mountains classification. In the sixth stage, a 16-man (15 at the end) group escaped in and held on to the finish at Brest, with Robert Cazala of Mercier winning the sprint. Altig and Anquetil were not there, but they had sent their teammate Albertus Geldermans to protect the team's interests. Geldermans was the best-placed man in the break, and their finishing margin of over five minutes was so large that Geldermans became the new overall leader.\nFlandria's Huub Zilverberg won stage seven from a two-way sprint with Gitane–Leroux's Bas Maliepaard; the pair attacked from a breakaway of twenty riders in the final and finished five seconds ahead at the finish in Saint-Nazaire. As the chasing breakaway went through a narrow section of the finishing straight, Gastone Nencini hit a gendarme (French police officer) and fell, also bringing down Darrigade. Most of the stages in the first week were unusually fast; stage seven was calculated to be , the fastest recorded to that point above a distance of . In the first part of the eighth stage, another large group escaped, which in the final kilometres had merged with a further chasing breakaway and ended with a sprint victory for Ghigi rider Mario Minieri in Luçon's velodrome. Breakaway rider Darrigade became the new general classification leader for the second time in the race.\nThe flat individual time trial from Luçon to La Rochelle in the second part of the stage was won by Anquetil, with Ercole Baldini second, 22 seconds behind. Darrigade briefly held the green jersey after stage 8a before it returned to Altig after 8b. Because of a successful breakaway in stage nine, Darrigade lost the lead to Flandria rider Willy Schroeders; Carpano's Antonio Bailetti won the stage. Willy Vannitsen of won the tenth stage's bunch sprint. The following stage was won by Vannitsen's teammate Eddy Pauwels, who dropped his fellow breakaway riders and soloed to victory with a four-minute advantage at Pau's motor race street circuit. A crash into the stage involving 22 riders was caused by a motorbike carrying a photographer. Van Looy, whose back was injured by the motorbike's handlebars, was the most notable casualty; he was able to continue for a further , before he was advised to retire from the race by the Tour's doctor, Pierre Dumas.\nPyrenees.\nStage twelve, the first mountain stage in the Pyrenees, saw Cazala take his second win from a sprint between an elite group of climbers and overall favourites who finished together after the descent to Saint-Gaudens. Schroeders could not keep up with this group, which included British rider Tom Simpson, and Simpson took the overall lead, becoming the first non-mainland European in history to wear the yellow jersey. Bahamontes led over the first-category Col du Tourmalet, and the two other lower categorised climbs, to take the lead in the mountains classification.\nThe next stage, an mountain time trial, was won by Bahamontes with a time of 47 min 23 s. Simpson placed 31st and lost the lead to Jef Planckaert of Flandria, who came in second place, 1min 25s down. Anquetil finished a further three seconds behind in third and sat fourth overall. Planckaert had taken over the leadership of Flandria after the departure of Van Looy, with former race leader Schroeders pledging his support. He was considered an able substitute due to his form during the season leading up to the Tour, winning the stage races Paris–Nice and the Tour de Luxembourg and the one-day classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège.\nThe final Pyrenean stage, the fourteenth, saw Saint-Raphaël rider Jean Stablinski attack his 10-strong breakaway with remaining and solo to the finish in Carcassonne with a margin of twelve seconds. The first of the three transitional stages, fifteen, that crossed France's southern coastline ended in a bunch sprint won by Vannitsen. In stage sixteen, Daems and Bailetti escaped the peloton with to go, with Daems attacking to win with a margin of three minutes; the chasing group of seven came in eight minutes later. Altig won the seventeenth stage in a sprint from a four-rider breakaway that finished over six minutes ahead of the peloton.\nAlps and finale.\nIn the first of the two Alpine stages, the eighteenth, attacks were expected. Instead, the riders went at a slow pace; in the first four hours, they had only raced . Later, some attacks took place, but they failed because of punctured tyres and the defensive tactics of the leading riders; in the end, Daems, who was a sprinter and not a climber, was able to win this mountain stage. Poulidor's injured hand was better by stage nineteen, and his team manager told him it was time to attack. He was placed ninth in the general classification, ten minutes behind, so he would have not likely been seen as a threat. Attacking over the final climbs, he soloed to the finish at Aix-les-Bains with an advantage of more than three minutes over his rivals, moving him to third place overall, 5min 43s in arrears, with Planckaert still leading and Anquetil second, 1min 8s down.\nIn stage twenty, a individual time trial finishing in Lyon, Planckaert came in fourth place, losing 5min 19s to the winner, Anquetil, who took the overall lead. Anquetil was a time trial specialist and considered unbeatable at the time. Baldini placed second, 2min 59s off the time set by Anquetil, and third was Poulidor who came in 5min 1s down to keep his third place overall. Stage 21 ended in a bunch sprint won by Dino Bruni of Gazzola.\nIn the final stage, Benedetti gained his second victory of the race from a bunch sprint in front of an estimated crowd of 30,000 at Parc des Princes. Anquetil finished the race to claim his third Tour de France, equalling the record number of Tour wins by a rider with Belgian Philippe Thys and Frenchman Louison Bobet. It was revealed later that Anquetil had ridden the race with tapeworm. He beat second-placed Planckaert by 4min 59 s, with Poulidor third, a further 5min 25s down. Altig won the points classification with a total of 173, which was 29 ahead of Daems in second. Bahamontes won the mountains classification with 137 points, 60 ahead of second-placed Imerio Massignan (). Saint-Raphaël won the team classification, which they led from the opening stage, with Mercier coming second and Flandria third. The riders with the most stages wins were Altig and Daems, with three each. The total number of riders who finished the race was 94, a record high to that point.\nDoping.\nDuring the night after the thirteenth stage, pre-race outsider Hans Junkermann became ill. He was placed seventh in the general classification, and the following day, stage fourteen, his team requested the start be delayed, which the organisation allowed. He was dropped by the peloton on the first climb in, and abandoned the race, saying \"bad fish\" was the cause. Fourteen riders withdrew from the Tour that day, all blaming food poisoning from rotten fish at the same hotel, including the former general classification leader Willy Schroeder and another pre-race contender Gastone Nencini. Writing in the French sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\", the Tour's race director, Jacques Goddet, said he did not believe their excuse and believed they had doped to recover time lost in the previous stage's time trial. Nothing was proven, although the hotel said they did not serve fish that night. A communiqué released by the Pierre Dumas warned that if riders and their \"soigneurs\" did not stop \"certain forms of preparation\", there would be daily post-stage hotel room inspections. Upset by this and doping accusations in the press, the riders threatened a fifteen-minute strike, but the journalist Jean Bobet, a former cyclist, was able to talk them into continuing, although he later provided the commentary for the documentary film about the 1962 Tour, \"Vive le Tour\" by Louis Malle, which ridiculed the riders and their \"bad fish\" explanation. In the following days, Dumas began to organise the inaugural European Conference on Doping and the Biological Preparation of the Competitive Athlete, which took place in January 1963. Since four of the riders involved came from , more than from any other team, the scandal is referred to as the \"Wiel's affair\".\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were three main individual classifications contested in the 1962 Tour de France, two of which award jerseys to their leaders, and also a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded to the top two positions at the end of every stage, including the individual time trials, but not the team time trial; first place received one minute and second place got 30 seconds. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nIn the points classification, riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to one point for the rider in fifteenth. The classification leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe mountains classification awarded points to the riders who reached summits first. Most stages of the race included one or more of these climbs, categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The calculation for the mountains classification was changed in 1962, and the fourth category was added. The leader of the classification was not identified by a jersey.\nThe classification for the teams was calculated by adding together the times of the first three cyclists of a team on each stage; the team with the lowest combined time on a stage won one first place point. To determine placings in the overall team classification, second and third place points were also awarded. The split stages (two and eight) were each combined. The riders on the team who led this classification were identified with yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the most aggressive rider; the decision was made by a jury composed of journalists. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Eddy Pauwels won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. Similar to the award for most combative rider, there was an award for the unluckiest rider given after every stage. The award for most bad luck during the entire Tour went to Rik Van Looy. Two further individual awards were given at the end of the Tour, the Prix Alex Virot, awarded to Raymond Poulidor for being the most loyal rider in the race, determined by a jury, and the Prix René Dunan, awarded to the 22-year-old Giorgo Zancanaro (Philco) for being the youngest finisher.\nA total of 3,000,000 French new francs (NF) was awarded in cash prizes in the race, with the overall winner of the general classification receiving 200,000 NF. The points and mountains classification winners got 100,000 NF and 50,000 NF respectively. The team classification winners were given 300,000 NF. The winner of the super-combativity award winner was given 60,000 NF and a Renault R8 car, and the unluckiest rider overall got 20,000 NF. The Prix Alex Virot was given 25,000 NF and the Prix René Dunan got 20,000 NF. There was also a special award with a prize of 3,000 NF, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the -high Col du Lautaret on stage nineteen. This prize was won by Juan Campillo of Margnat.\nSuper Prestige Pernod ranking.\nRiders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the Super Prestige Pernod ranking, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. The 90 points accrued by Jacques Anquetil moved him from outside the ranking to fourth place, whilst Jef Planckaert climbed from third position to take the lead from former leader Rik Van Looy."

        "text": "The 1971 Tour de France was the 58th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race consisted of 22 stages, including three split stages, starting in Mulhouse on 26 June and finishing at the Vélodrome de Vincennes in Paris on 18 July. There were three time trial stages and two rest days. Eddy Merckx of the team won the overall general classification, defending his title to win his third Tour de France in a row. Joop Zoetemelk () finished second, 9:51 minutes behind, and Lucien Van Impe was third (), just over 11 minutes in arrears.\nPre-race favourite Merckx took the first yellow jersey as general classification leader after his team won the prologue stage's team time trial. Merckx's teammate Rini Wagtmans took the Tour lead after the second of stage 1's three split stages, before returning it to his leader by the end of the day. The leading positions of the general classification became clearer after stage 2 when a sixteen-strong breakaway group of mostly pre-race favourites ended with a margin of over nine minutes. On stage 8 in the Massif Central, Merckx's closest rival Luis Ocaña () attacked and won atop Puy de Dôme to move within just over 30 seconds of the race leader, just behind second-placed Zoetemelk.\nIn the Chartreuse Mountains on stage 10, Merckx had a tyre puncture and was distanced by a group of rivals, with Zoetemelk of the group taking the race lead. Another from the group, Ocaña, took the yellow jersey the next day as he soloed for to victory up to Orcières-Merlette in the Alps, ending with an overall lead of more than eight minutes. Merckx gained back close to two minutes the following stage as he broke away from the start with a small group in record-breaking speed to Marseille. Two days later in the Pyrenees on stage 14, a thunderstorm passed as the riders traversed the Col de Menté mountain pass. Race leader Ocaña crashed on the wet roads during the descent, and afterwards was hit by other riders. He left the race with injury, with Merckx reluctantly taking over the Tour lead. He comfortably held the yellow jersey for the remaining stages, ending the Tour with victory in the individual time trial held in Paris.\nIn the other race classifications, Merckx also won the points and the combination classifications. Van Impe won the mountains classification. The intermediate sprints classification was won by Zoetemelk's teammate Pieter Nassen. The winners of the team classification were . The overall award for most combative rider was given to Ocaña. Merckx won the most stages, with four.\nTeams.\nThe 1971 edition of the Tour de France consisted of thirteen teams, two less than the previous Tour. Teams were either invited or paid a participation fee. The Italian-based and the Belgian teams announced they would not be entering the race due to the high cost, although Salvarani later reached an agreement. Belgian-based and Tour co-organiser Félix Lévitan were in disagreements over the team's participation and there was speculation that the team would instead race the Grand Tour of Italy, the Giro d'Italia, which took place one month before the Tour. The team chose to wait for Lévitan's decision regarding their entry, which came following the Giro's start, and therefore did not participate in the Giro. Ultimately, Lévitian requested the team to pay extra money, on top of the 25,000 French francs (f) entry fee, to participate in the Tour.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of ten riders, resulting in a start list total of 130. Of these, 37 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from twelve countries, with the majority of them coming from France (35), Belgium (25), Italy (25), Spain (21) and Netherlands (14). Francisco Javier Galdeano () was the youngest rider at 21 years and 201 days, and the oldest was Ventura Díaz () at 32 years and 304 days. The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe rider considered the clear favourite for the overall general classification before the Tour was 's Eddy Merckx, who had won the 1969 and 1970 Tours by the large margins of 17:54 and 12:41 minutes respectively. He had been the strongest rider throughout the 1971 season, winning 54 of the 124 races he entered (43.5%). Of the 13 before the Tour, the most notable were the one-day races Milan–San Remo, Omloop Het Volk, and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the general classification in the stage races Giro di Sardegna, Paris–Nice, Tour of Belgium, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and Grand Prix du Midi Libre. He opted for the Dauphiné and Midi Libre races to warm up for the Tour instead of the Giro d'Italia, which he rode the two previous seasons. In these races, constant adjustment to his riding position caused a knee injury, and he came close to abandoning the final stage of the Midi Libre, a month before the Tour. Later in his retirement, he revealed that heading into the Tour his \"condition was not good\" and that riding the Giro was the ideal preparation because of the harder climbs. Since 1968, his team were undefeated in the team time trial discipline of the prologue stage, and there was speculation whether he would be able to lead the race from beginning to end. Merckx was such an overwhelming favourite that the interest was not in if could win, but rather the manner in which he would do it.\nThe strongest challenger to Merckx was expected to be Luis Ocaña (). He and Merckx were the same age at 26, born eight days apart in June. Both had made their Tour debuts in 1969, but unlike the success of Merckx, Ocaña crashed out of the race on a descent. In 1970, Ocaña won the Vuelta a España, Spain's Grand Tour, and was likewise Merckx's main rival before the Tour, but he finished the race over an hour behind in 31st place. His confidence in beating Merckx grew in 1971, saying: \"they all surrender to Merckx, but I'm going to stand up to him\". Speaking prior to the Tour, climbing specialist Ocaña thought he would able to get the better of the all-rounder Merckx in the mountains, as he had shown on the Col du Granier Alpine climb in the Dauphiné, a race in which he ultimately finished second overall to Merckx. His biggest results of the season prior to the Tour were the mountains classification of the aforementioned race and the overall victories of the Tour of the Basque Country and Volta a Catalunya. The Spanish media did not rate their compatriot Ocaña's chances of winning highly, in contrast to in France, where he had lived since childhood.\nThe next contender was thought to be Joop Zoetemelk of , who in his debut season as a professional was runner-up in the 1970 Tour. His most notable performance of the year so far was at the Vuelta in May, where he won the mountains classification and finished sixth overall. He finished second to Merckx in the closely contested Midi Libre.\nSeveral other riders were named as favourites for a high place in the general classification. The winner of the 1971 Giro and the third-place finisher of the 1970 Tour Gösta Pettersson () was considered by Merckx to be among two of his closest rivals, along with Zoetemelk. Bernard Thévenet () was third in the Dauphiné. Climber Lucien Van Impe (), who was sixth overall in 1970, was also consider a contender. Other favourites included Joaquim Agostinho (), Gianni Motta () and Leif Mortensen (). Agostinho took a three-week rest two weeks before the Tour following bad crash at the Dauphiné. Van Impe's teammate Lucien Aimar, a Tour veteran, was the only rider entering apart from Merckx to have won the race, the 1966 edition.\nNotable absentees from the start list were Raymond Poulidor (), Felice Gimondi (), Frans Verbeeck (), Georges Pintens (), Roger Pingeon () and Jan Janssen (). Poulidor, who had top-ten finishes in all of the previous nine Tours bar one, withdrew from his team's squad stating: \"I will only do this if my physical condition leaves something to be desired\". Gimondi, winner of the 1965 Tour, was not selected by his team as Motta was preferred as the leader. Verbeeck, whose team did not enter, was considered to be one of few that would challenge Merckx. Merckx's one-day race rival Pintens was another from a team not entering. He seemingly managed a rare feat of exposing weakness in Merckx at the notably cold Liège–Bastogne–Liège in April, when he reeled in the tiring lone leader Merckx taking it to the two-way sprint finish won by Merckx, who was later found by his \"soigneur\" (team assistant) physically exhausted sat on a stool in a shower. Winner of the 1967 Tour Pingeon was serving a doping suspension from April 30 to July 30. Janssen, winner of the 1968 Tour, kept to his promise to never ride a Tour again, made following his bad crash in the 1970 Paris–Tours. He was critical of the Tour's commercial prioritisation which made the race too hard for riders.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 16 October 1970, it was announced that the city of Mulhouse in eastern France would host the 1971 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"), which consisted of a team time trial prologue stage and two further stages. The entire route was announced on 8 December at a press conference in Paris by race directors Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan. New rules to discourage the use of doping were introduced by cycling's governing body, the \"Union Cycliste Internationale\" (UCI); stages lengths were reduced, only twenty stages were allowed, and rest days were made compulsory. The latter was a re-introduction to the Tour. At a distance of , it was shorter than the previous Tour by and the shortest since 1905.\nWith the shortened distance in addition to the increased financial running costs, the race organisers maximised the amount of route locations which paid the race to start, pass through or finish there. The navigation of the host locations made a loose figure of eight route, unlike the usual continuous loop. There were a total of five transfers which added up to a distance of . For the first time in a Tour there were air transfers, from Le Touquet to Paris and Marseille to Toulouse. The previous Tour's split stages, where two or more shorter stages would be run on the same day, had drawn complaints from the riders, nevertheless, they remained as the income they provided was an overriding factor. There were three split stages; two stages were split half and one in thirds. The reduction in distance and amount of stages saw more climbs introduced, and it was thought that this edition was more suited to climbing specialists. Overall, the route was seen as easier than recent editions.\nThe Tour took place over 23 days, including the two rest days, between 26 June and 18 July. Beginning in the Black Forest and Vosges Mountains, with visits to Switzerland and West Germany, the race then headed north-west to the coast passing through the Ardennes and south-east Belgium. After the first rest day and air transfer, racing resumed in the outskirts of Paris, taking the Tour through the Massif Central highlands and the Chartreuse Mountains towards the Alps. After the second rest day and a stage to the Mediterranean coast at Marseille came the other air transfer. The race then moved into the Pyrenees, with the closing stages taking place between the south-west and the finish in Paris.\nOf the mass-start full stages, the longest was stage 7 at , and stage 15 was the shortest at , the shortest in the history of the race (). There were three time trial events with a total distance of , two were competed individually (13 and 20) and one was raced by teams (the prologue). It was the first time the team time trial format was used for a Tour prologue stage. Of the remaining 22 full and split stages, twelve were officially classified as flat, four as medium mountain and six as high mountain. There were three summit finishes: stage 8, to Puy de Dôme; stage 11, to Orcières-Merlette; and stage 15, to Superbagnères. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 16a. It was among seven first-category rated climbs in the race. The Tour included four new start or finish locations: Basel, in stage 1b; Marche-en-Famenne, in stage 4; Le Touquet, in stage 6b; and Gourette, in stages 16a and 16b.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were five individual classifications contested in the 1971 Tour and also a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) of 20, 10 and 5 seconds were awarded to the top three positions, respectively, at the end every mass-start stage classified as flat. In the flat split stages bonuses of 8, 6 and 3 seconds were given. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. Eddy Merckx was meant to wear the yellow jersey in the prologue stage as the winner of the previous edition but the organisers forgot to bring it to the stage start.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. High finishes on flat stages awarded more points, 30 for the winner down to 1 point for 15th place. The flat split stages gave 20 points to the winner down to 2 points for 10th. In mountain stages and individual time trials, 15 points were given to the winner down to 1 point for 15th. Two mountain stages were given less points due their lengths, stages 15 and 16b. No points were awarded in the team time trial prologue stage. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. Following Merckx's dominance of the classifications during the 1969 Tour, a new rule was introduced in 1970 to allow the second-placed rider of the points classification to wear a green-black jersey if one rider led both the general and points classifications. If this occurred 1971, the rider in second place would wear the green jersey, a rule that has remained ever since.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded points to the riders who reached summits first. Most stages of the race included one or more of these climbs, categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Changes were made to the calculation in 1971, with the number of points given in the second, third, and fourth-categories increased. First-category ranked mountains gave a maximum 15 points for the first rider across, with the subsequent categories giving 10, 12, and 5 points to the first at the summit respectively. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, with no identifying jersey.\nThe combination classification was calculated by adding each rider's overall ranking positions in the general, points, and mountains classifications. The rider with lowest combined total led the classification. In the event of tie, the positions were shared. The leader of the classification wore a white jersey.\nThere was also an intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules to the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints, with 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1 awarded respectively. The classification was given more importance in 1971 with the introduction of time bonuses; 5, 3 and 1 seconds were awarded to the first three positions in the sprints respectively. The 1971 Tour was the first time that more than one sprint featured in a full stage. In 1971, this classification had no associated jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there individual awards given after each stage, excluding the prologue, and at the conclusion of the Tour to the most combative, elegant and amiable riders, with decisions made by a jury composed of journalists. The split stages each had combined winners. At the conclusion of the Tour, overall awards, also decided by journalists, were given to Luis Ocaña, Leif Mortensen and Jean-Pierre Danguillaume, respectively. There was also a special award, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the Côte de Dourdan on stage 19. This prize was won by Wilmo Francioni of Ferretti.\nA total of 470,600 f was awarded in cash prizes in the race, with the overall winner of the general classification receiving 191,550 f. The stage winners, award winners and classification leaders, were rewarded with cash prizes. The amiable award winners received a selection of meat products. Joop Zoetemelk got a color television set for being the Tour's youngest finisher.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" in Mulhouse.\nThe prologue team time trial consisted of four laps of a circuit around the streets of Mulhouse. covered it at an average speed of to win with a combined time of 1:05:16 hours, beating second-placed by 1:48 minutes and third-placed by 2:16 minutes. took the lead of the team classification. The general classification was the only one of the Tour's individually contested classifications taken into account for the prologue stage. Eddy Merckx led his squad across the finish line to take the lead of the general classification and with it the first yellow jersey. The five teammates that finished with him took up the following places. Only time bonifications (time subtracted) counted towards the classification, and their victory gave each of the riders twenty-second time bonuses. Three riders from and six from received time bonuses of ten and five seconds respectively.\nThe second day of the Tour was split into three short stages which journeyed into Switzerland and West Germany, before returning to Mulhouse. In the first part, the riders purposely rode at a slow pace in protest, headed by the French riders, at the disproportionate awarding of the cash prize given to stage winners against the next nineteen finishers. After a talk with Félix Lévitan at the lead car, an agreement was made to share it out more evenly between the top thirty. The stage ended with a large bunch sprint in Basel taken by Eric Leman of . Merckx's teammate Rini Wagtmans unknowingly finished ahead of him in the sprint to take over the leading position in the general classification; with all the riders equalled on time, this countback came into effect.\nMerckx won the opening intermediate sprint of the second split stage to gain a five-second time bonus to reclaim the race lead, even though Wagtmans then went on to struggle on a climb halfway on the stage and was dropped by the peloton (main field), finishing the stage a minute behind Merckx; Wagtmans later admitted to relinquishing the yellow jersey back to his team leader, at the time, lying that his shoes were a size too small and had caused rubbing. The stage finished on the cinder track inside Freiburg's Möslestadion with a bunch sprint won by rider Gerben Karstens. A bunch sprint finish followed again in the final part of the day, which saw Albert Van Vlierberghe of finish first of the large field. Across the three parts of stage 1, the points classification's green jersey changed hands between Leman, Walter Godefroot () and Karstens, respectively. Joop Zoetemelk became the first leader of the mountains classification following stage 1b.\nVosges, Belgium and north-west.\nWith remaining of stage 2, Zoetemelk led climbing specialists Lucien Van Impe and José Manuel Fuente () with attack on a depleted peloton over the summit of the second-category rated Vosges climb of . A Merckx move brought back the attackers on the descent, which saw the formation of an elite sixteen-rider breakaway group that included all the pre-race favourites, except for Joaquim Agostinho and Lucien Aimar. In gale-force tail winds, the leaders reached speeds of on the flat terrain, ending with a nine-and-a-half-minute advantage over the peloton at the finish in Strasbourg. On the wet cinder track of Stade Tivoli, Herman Van Springel led-out teammate Merckx to victory in a frantic sprint finish with Roger De Vlaeminck of . The points gained by De Vlaeminck put him in the green jersey. The fifteen riders that ended in the breakaway now held an advantage of close to nine minutes in the general classification. Of those competing for the overall prize, they were unreservedly now the leader of their team, halting any uncertainty over hierarchy.\nStage 3 headed west to Nancy for another cinder track finish, where Wagtmans took a sprint win from the ten-man breakaway. The following day the stage ended in Marche-en-Famenne for its overnight stay in Belgium. With of the remaining, a duo of Jean-Pierre Genet () and José Gómez Lucas () escaped the peloton, who, on the straight slightly uphill finish, managed to hold off the field by a distance of at the line, which was crossed by Genet first.\nStage 5 featured two iconic locations of one-day \"monument\" races, the short steep sett-paved climb Muur van Geraardsbergen of the Tour of Flanders and the stage finish of Roubaix Velodrome, likewise used in Paris–Roubaix. With remaining, the crowds lining the Geraardsbergen saw a breakaway by Agostinho, together with the uncooperative Jos Huysmans (). The pair were caught, before another break moved clear. The group of five reached the banked velodrome over a minute ahead of the peloton, and Pietro Guerra of won the stage in a sprint with Huysmans's teammate Julien Stevens.\nThe two-legged stage 6 was raced over a total distance of , as the Tour reached the channel coast at Le Touquet. In the first part, Leman claimed a second stage win of the race in a bunch sprint at Amiens's dirt racecourse. Mauro Simonetti of won the second part on Le Touquet's promenade from a six-rider breakaway, only seconds ahead of the encroaching peloton. The Tour's first rest day was spent in the resort of Le Touquet. The fifteen riders that profited on stage 2 still led the general classification, with Merckx holding a 26-second advantage over Van Springel, and De Vlaeminck a further 11 seconds down in third place.\nMassif Central and Chartreuse.\nAfter their rest in Le Touquet, the riders took two early planes to Paris and the start of the transitional stage 7, a route to Nevers and the subsequent two-stage traverse of the Massif Central. With the peloton in the final kilometre, there were three crashes, one of which included De Vlaeminck, who injured his wrist and lost the green jersey by end of the stage to Karstens. In the bunch sprint, Leman claimed his third win. Merckx was expecting a dangerous sprint, so he chose not to participate. Although to a lesser extent than in his previous Tours, Merckx competed for the time bonuses available in intermediate sprints and final sprints throughout the flat terrain of the early stages, unlike his closest rival Ocaña, who had been saving his energy for the upcoming mountains, on the advice of five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil.\nStage 8 saw the Tour's first summit finish, atop the dormant volcano of Puy de Dôme at an elevation of , a first-category climb. Merckx initiated an early twelve-strong breakaway that included Ocaña, but it only lasted . Thereafter, Merckx and his team controlled the race until the early slopes of the final climb. With remaining, a failed Bernard Thévenet attack was soon followed by a successful one by Ocaña, who at one point led by 40 seconds. Mountains classification leader Zoetemelk and Agostinho moved ahead of Merckx in the final kilometre, with the two placing behind winner Ocaña. In fourth place, Merckx recovered in the final , limiting the losses to Ocaña to only fifteen seconds. Zoetemelk moved up to second overall, 36 seconds behind Merckx, with third-placed Ocaña a further second down. The next day, a group of nine riders broke away over the remainder of the Massif Central climbs and ended six minutes ahead of the peloton in Saint-Étienne. Godefroot won the sprint finish, moving him into the lead of the points classification.\nStage 10 culminated with the two first-category Chartreuse passes of Col du Cucheron and Col de Porte, before a long descent to the finish in Grenoble at the foot of the Alps. A burst of pace set by Ocaña's team on the Cucheron ascent had reduced the field to a group of overall favourites, leaving Merckx without support. Soon after, Merckx got a tyre puncture and just managed to stay upright, and he was left waiting for his delayed team car to get a replacement wheel. An Ocaña-led attack with Zoetemelk, Thévenet, Van Impe, and Gösta Pettersson disobeyed an unwritten rule of the peloton by attacking the race leader when they puncture. Ocaña set such a fast pace up the Col de Porte that climbing specialist Van Impe was dropped. They reached the summit two minutes ahead of Merckx and the chase group, and stayed ahead to Grenoble's velodrome, where Thévenet won the sprint finish. Zoetemelk took the yellow jersey, with Merckx coming in seventh place at 1:36 minutes down and dropping to fourth overall, behind Ocaña and Gösta Pettersson respectively. The green jersey was gained by Cyrille Guimard of , who came in fifth on the stage accompanied by Van Impe.\nAlps and transition.\nIn the opening of stage 11, the race began with the steep Alpine second-category climb of Côte de Laffrey, known locally as 'the ramp'. An attack early on the climb by Agostinho was joined by a group of Ocaña, Van Impe, Gösta Pettersson, and Zoetemelk. Merckx, who was suffering with an upset stomach, was two minutes behind the Ocaña-led group at the summit in a second group of chasers accompanied by his teammates. The leading group gained a two-minute margin along the consistent terrain of the historic Route Napoléon, with Ocaña dropping his fellow riders on a detour climb over the second-category Col du Noyer with remaining. He then performed a time trial-like solo effort for the remainder of the route and up to victory atop the first-category climb to the Orcières-Merlette ski resort. Van Impe had also ridden alone since the Noyer and finished nearly six minutes behind Ocaña. Merckx led the group of remaining favourites all the way to the finish, 8:42 minutes in arrears. Ocaña took the general classification lead, with Van Impe rising to third, behind Zoetemelk. After the stage, Merckx admitted defeat in the overall race to the new leader, but Ocaña was still wary of the former leader. Van Impe took the lead of the mountains classification from Zoetemelk. Ocaña set such a pace that 61 cyclists finished outside the original allowed time limit, leaving only 39 in the race. The time limit was consequently extended such that all but three were allowed to start the next stage. De Vlaeminck abandoned the Tour, four days after his crash on stage 7. The next day was the second rest of the race, spent at Orcières-Merlette.\nThe transition to the Pyrenees began with stage 12, taking the Tour from Orcières-Merlette to Marseille at the coast. The day's high temperature had brought forward the start time by ten minutes. Whilst Merckx and his team were prepared to race on the start line, new race leader Ocaña arrived late and was at the back of the field saying to journalists that he expected the stage to be a \"formality\", at the same time dismissing warnings by his teammates of an early attack on the descent from his rival. Merckx's teammate Wagtmans immediately attacked to form a lead group of twelve, including Merckx and two more teammates. The unexpected move fractured the peloton, and many riders fell as tubular tyres glued during the rest day became detached from wheels rims. The lead group reduced to nine riders on the flat terrain, and they held an advantage of between one and two minutes for the remainder of the stage, with the sprint finish in the Old Port of Marseille won by rider Luciano Armani, ahead of Merckx. The leaders covered the stage distance of in 5:25:28 hours, breaking the record for the fastest average speed of a mass-start Tour stage at . They arrived about one hour ahead of the expected schedule, and the preparations at the finish line not yet been completed, with the race being missed by some fans and dignitaries. The live television slots were missed, and the mayor of Marseille, Gaston Defferre, was so upset that he refused to let the race visit his city again.\nThe reduced peloton finished the stage almost two minutes behind the lead group. This could have been more if not for a tactical error by , when four riders of theirs were dropped by the peloton as they waited to pace back tyre-punctured teammate Joseph Bruyère, only just making the time limit; with them being at the front of the peloton they would have been able to disrupt and slow down the chase. Although Merckx rose to second overall, he was just over seven and a half minutes behind the leader, and was left dissatisfied with the meagre finishing margin. Reassuring his leader, Wagtmans told him that Ocaña had looked exhausted on the podium after the stage and that \"Ocaña has no future in this Tour.\" After the stage, the riders were transferred by plane between the cities of Marseille and Toulouse, before a coach ride to Albi and stage 13's individual time trial held the next day in the town.\nThe hilly and technical course which started and finished at the Circuit d'Albi motor-racing track was won by Merckx with a time of 22:57 minutes, beating second-placed Ocaña by 11 seconds. Merckx accused the French television-operated car of following alongside Ocaña and giving him an unfair draft, but the reason for this was that for the first time colour television was being broadcast live and a car was required instead of a motorbike. This furthered tensions in the race with accusations that, in the previous stage, seven riders of the all-Spanish team, allied to Ocaña, were given unwarranted reprieves after finishing outside the time limit.\nPyrenees.\nStage 14, from the town Revel to the Pyreneean spa town of Luchon, featured the third-category Col de Portet d'Aspet and then the second-category passes of Col de Menté and Col du Portillon. On the Portet d'Aspet, Fuente shed his fellow breakaway riders to summit with a lead of 2:20 minutes; Fuente was an elite climber who won the mountains classification at the 1971 Giro, but was not a concern to the Tour favourites as he was close to two hours down in 100th place overall. In the group of favourites about five minutes behind, Ocaña defended four attacks from Merckx, with the offensive continuing on the Menté that soon followed. As the lone leader Fuente summited the Menté ahead, the weather severely worsened with a thunderstorm of torrential rain and large hailstones, making for a dangerous descent, with vision on the mud flooded roads impaired to around . Many riders got tyre punctures while descending, including Ocaña, who rode with one as he closely followed Merckx. With braking very difficult in the wet, both skidded and fell as they overran a flooded left-hand bend from the top. Ocaña was hit by a rider as he got up in the middle of the road, and a few moments later, he was hit again as he stood on the roadside requesting a spare wheel from his team car. As the others involved rode on, Ocaña was left lying unresponsive in a state of shock, semi-conscious and struggling to breathe. He was unable to continue in the race and was taken to the foot of the climb by ambulance and then by helicopter to hospital in the nearby town of Saint-Gaudens. Suffering with back pain, he was discharged following day.\nThe worst of the storm had passed after about ten minutes, and following a brief entry into Spain to climb the Portillon, Fuente descended to victory in Luchon, 6:21 minutes ahead a group of five including Merckx, Van Impe and Zoetemelk, who were a minute ahead of the next bunch. Merckx became the new race leader, but out of respect for Ocaña, he refused the yellow jersey in the ceremony at the end of the stage, and his request not to wear it during the next stage was granted; he wore the combination classification leader's white jersey instead. Merckx considered leaving the race, because he did not want to win due to Ocaña's misfortune, saying \"I would rather finish second than win in this way\". His \"directeur sportif\" (team manager) was among those to convince him to remain, reminding him that the work-shy 'wheelsuckers' Zoetemelk and Van Impe would be the next in line to win the race. Gösta Pettersson abandoned the race on the ascent of the Menté; he was fifth overall at the end of the previous stage.\nStage 15 was a mass-start hill climb from Luchon, across , up to the Superbagnères ski resort. Together with the inclement weather, the form of Fuente continued as he won again, attacking from the end. Van Impe and Thévenet moved clear with remaining, coming in half-way between Merckx and Zoetemelk, a minute down. The average speed of covered by the last finisher, Eddy Peelman of , is among the very slowest of any post-World War II Tour stage, all those within the time limits. In the general classification, Merckx now led Van Impe by 2:17 minutes, who had moved 4 seconds ahead of Zoetemelk to second place. Merckx took the points classification led from Guimard.\nThe first leg of stage 16 was the last with mountain climbing, first crossing the second-category Col de Peyresourde and Col d'Aspin, followed by the higher first-category Col du Tourmalet and Col d'Aubisque, before a short descent to the finish at the Gourette ski resort. Merckx injured his right knee following two falls on the Menté, and had been sleep-deprived for the two nights since. He attacked on the descent of the Col d'Aspin, followed by Van Impe, and by the bottom the two leaders held a 40-second margin over the peloton. Zoetemelk bridged across to the pair on the early portions of the Tourmalet. Van Impe escaped a kilometre from the summit, where he held a lead of 1:10 minutes, but Merckx and Zoetemelk worked together into the prevailing headwind on the descent and caught him at the bottom. The three leaders then slowed, and they were joined by several others on the Col d'Aubisque, where another storm awaited the race. Merckx defended the solitary attack of Van Impe on the climb. A local to area, Bernard Labourdette, took the victory on Bastille Day, summiting with a two-minute advantage and soloing to Gourette. Labourdette, a teammate of Ocaña, afterwards said: \"This is the stage that Luis Ocaña should and would have won.\" Merckx lead the others over the finish.\nThe second part of stage 16 brought the race down from the Pyrenees to the city of Pau. The opening from Gourette was neutralised due to flooding on the Col d'Aubisque descent caused by the storm, with racing starting in the village of Eaux-Bonnes across a reduced course of . In the final kilometres, Van Springel went clear of an elite-rider breakaway to win the finishing sprint ahead of fellow escapee Willy Van Neste of . Van Springel took points away from teammate Merckx's green jersey rival Guimard, who beat Merckx in the sprint for third to his bring overall deficit to five points. Merckx previously accused Guimard of assisting Ocaña chase him down on stage 13 to Marseille.\nFinal stages.\nThe next three stages took the Tour to its final stage in Paris. In the morning of stage 17, Merckx visited Ocaña in recuperation at his home in Mont-de-Marsan, the host of the stage start. The course of stage 17 through the Landes forest to Bordeaux, was more often processional and traditionally ended in a bunch sprint. With remaining, an attack launched by Van Impe's teammate Raymond Riotte formed a breakaway with four others, including Merckx. Guimard missed the move as he was swapping bottles around on his bicycle. Merckx won the finishing sprint from the group, increasing his leading margins in the general and points classifications to 5:38 minutes and 31 points respectively.\nOn stage 18 to Poitiers, Jean-Pierre Danguillaume of sprinted to victory from a ten-man breakaway that finished close to three minutes ahead of the peloton. In the last kilometres of the next stage, nine riders bridged across from the peloton to the breakaway of three, and from this rider Jan Krekels won the sprint finish, ahead of Guimard, on Versailles's in outskirts of Paris.\nThe final stage's individual time trial began in Versailles and ended at the Vélodrome de Vincennes. It was won by Merckx, 2:36 minutes ahead of Agostinho, with Wagtmans a further 16 seconds down in third. Merckx extended his overall lead from 5:38 to 9:51 minutes, becoming the third rider, after Louison Bobet and Anquetil, to win three Tours in a row. Zoetemelk raced the time trial 1:22 minutes quicker than Van Impe to overhaul a 7-second deficit from before the stage and finish the Tour second overall. Merckx also ended the race as the points classification winner, beating Guimard by a margin of 16. Van Impe won the mountains classification, 48 points ahead of Zoetemelk. Merckx finished highest in the general and two aforementioned classifications to win the combination classification. The intermediate sprints classification was won by Zoetemelk's teammate Pieter Nassen. The winners of the team classification were . Of the 130 starters, 94 reached the finish of the final stage.\nAftermath.\nAt the time, the 1971 Tour was considered the most exciting in recent years due mainly to the contest between Merckx and Ocaña. This has since been named among the greatest battles and overall moments in Tour de France history, with its significant stages of 11, 12, and 14, described as a \"trilogy\" by journalist Richard Moore in his 2014 book \"Étape: The Untold Stories of the Tour de France's Defining Stages\".\nSome observers have thought that if Ocaña had continued he would have won the race. Tour journalist Jock Wadley predicted that Ocaña would have had an advantage of five minutes over Merckx before the final time trial, and then held three minutes by the end. Jacques Goddet believed that Merckx was a lesser climber and could not have overhauled Ocaña, but writer Olivier Dazat suggested that Merckx was mentally stronger and would have relentlessly chased down Ocaña. Riotte said that Ocaña's crash was \"provoked\" by Merckx and that if not then, Ocaña would have faltered eventually.\nOcaña soon recovered from his injuries and had a successful end to the season. He next rode against Merckx over a month later in the world road race championship in Mendrisio, Switzerland, where a mistake of going back to get a drink was countered by Merckx, and he gained his second rainbow jersey as the victor. The rivalry continued into the following Tour, but Ocaña left the race with illness. Merckx went on to win a fourth Tour, and then won his fifth and final in 1974. He skipped the 1973 edition, which Ocaña won, and the rivalry never reached the heights seen in the 1971 Tour. Ocaña was named as his closest rival by Merckx, who is now regarded by many as the most successful rider in the history of competitive cycling.\nThe second, third and fourth-place finishers of the race went on to win at least one Tour during their careers; Zoetemelk in 1980, Van Impe in 1976, and Thévenet in 1975 and 1977.\nSuper Prestige Pernod ranking.\nRiders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the Super Prestige Pernod ranking, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. Eddy Merckx held his substantial lead in the ranking at the end of the Tour.\nDoping.\nIn total, 100 doping tests were done during the 1971 Tour de France, from which 2 returned positive: Yves Ravaleu, after the thirteenth stage; Jean-Claude Daunat, after the eighteenth stage. Both riders received the customary punishment: a fine of 1200 f; being set back to the last place in the stage's results and getting ten minutes penalty time in the general classification."

        "title": "1910 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1910 Tour de France was the eighth edition of the Tour de France, taking place 3 to 31 July. It consisted of 15 stages over , ridden at an average speed of 28.680 km/h. It was the first Tour to enter the Pyrenees mountains. Two main candidates for the victory were 1909 winner François Faber, a sprinter, and Octave Lapize, a climber, both members of the powerful Alcyon team. Because of the points system, their chances for the overall victory were approximately equal. The race was not decided until the final stage, after which Lapize had won by a difference of only four points.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe courses of the Tour de France in 1907, 1908 and 1909 had been nearly identical. In 1910, the Pyrenees were included, an initiative from Adolphe Steinès, who had drawn the course for the Tour de France since the first Tour in 1903. Compared to the 1907, 1908 and 1909 Tours, the stages Nîmes-Toulouse and Toulouse-Bayonne were replaced by three stages, Nîmes–Perpignan, Perpignan–Luchon and Luchon–Bayonne.\nTour organiser Henri Desgrange at first refused the inclusion of the Pyrenees, but later gave in and sent Steinès to the Pyrenees to see if it was possible to send cyclists up the mountains. Steinès encountered many difficulties. He went there at 27 January 1910, and asked an innkeeper for directions over the Tourmalet. The innkeeper replied that it is barely crossable in July, so practically impossible in January. Steinès hired a car anyway and rode up the mountain. Close to the top, there was so much snow that the car could not go further, and he continued on foot. Steinès walked during the night, and fell down a ravine. At 3 a.m. he was found by a search party. He quickly got some food and a hot bath. The next morning, he sent a positive telegram to Desgrange: \"Have crossed the Tourmalet on foot STOP Road passable to vehicles STOP No snow STOP\".\nWhen it was announced that the Pyrenees were included in the race, 136 cyclists had entered the race. After the news, 26 cyclists removed themselves from the starting list. Other newspapers reacted to the Tour's route as \"dangerous\" and \"bizarre\".\nAlso new in 1910 was the broom wagon, to pick up the cyclists that abandoned during the race. This was a reaction of the Tour organisers to the criticism of the cyclists, many cycling independently with no team support, on the difficult mountains. It was designed to prevent riders from cheating, by using other forms of transport. In the tenth stage, over the four mountains in the Pyrenees, cyclists were allowed to finish the stage in the broom wagon and still start the next stage.\nTechnically, a new addition were gears. Lucien Petit-Breton, Maurice Brocco, Henri Cornet, Charles Pavese and Jean Alavoine rode with gears.\nWhat had not changed was the points system. A cyclist received points, based on their rankings. As in 1909, the points system was \"cleaned up\" two times: after the 9th stage and after the 14th stage. Cyclists who had abandoned the race were removed from the rankings of the previous stages, and the classification was recalculated.\nTeams.\nAlthough cyclist were in 1909 able to register for the Tour with a sponsor, they were still considered to be riding as individuals; in 1910 they competed for the first time in teams.\nThe cyclists were not so enthusiastic about the inclusion of the Pyrenées, and there were fewer participants: 110 instead of 150 in 1909. There were three teams with 10 cyclists each, including all the favourites for the overall victory: Alcyon, Le Globe and Legnano. The French team \"La Française\" decided not to join, but allowed their cyclists to ride for the Italian Legnano team. The other 80 cyclists rode as individuals, this was called the \"isolés\" category.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage, from Paris to Roubaix, was won by Charles Crupelandt. In the second stage, François Faber showed his strengths, and won the stage, and took the lead.\nOn the rest day between the sixth and seventh stage in Nice, cyclist Adolphe Hélière died whilst swimming. He was the first victim of the Tour de France.\nIn the ninth stage, four mountains were climbed, and Desgrange saw how much trouble the cyclists had on these mountains. The tenth stage would include the Pyrenees mountains, so Desgrange left the race and made Victor Breyer the director of the stage. In that tenth stage, the Tourmalet was climbed, the highest point of the 1910 Tour de France. Octave Lapize reached the top first, followed by Gustave Garrigou. Garrigou was the only cyclist who reached the top without dismounting, and received an extra prize of 100 francs for that. The next climb was the Aubisque. Lapize struggled there, and regional rider François Lafourcade lead the race. The organisers had a car standing in top, and when Lafourcade passed them, they did not recognize him, and when they found out it was Lafourcade, they were surprised that such an unknown rider had been able to pass all the 'cracks'. When Lapize passed the organiser's car (15 minutes later), he screamed \"Assassins!\", and announced that he would give up during the descent. Downhill, he refound his strength and was able to catch up to Lafourcade, and even win the stage. By the end of the stage, ten riders had officially completed the stage on bike.\nAfter the 12th stage, Faber was leading the race by only one point. In that stage to Brest, Faber punctured, and Lapize took over the lead, helped by Garrigou.\nIn the 14th stage, Faber sped away almost from the start in what could be his last chance to win the Tour de France. It seemed that he had a chance, until a flat tyre caused him to lose time, and Lapize could get back to him, again aided by Garrigou. Lapize improved his lead by winning the stage, and had a six-point margin before the last stage.\nIn that last stage, it was Lapize who suffered from a flat tyre, shortly after the start. Faber raced away, but could not pull off the stunt: he had a flat tyre. He still finished ahead of Lapize, but won back only two points, so the 1910 Tour de France was won by Lapize.\nResults.\nThe Alcyon team was dominant in the 1910 Tour de France, winning 9 out of 15 stages.\nGeneral classification.\nOf the 110 starting cyclists, 41 finished. The winner, Octave Lapize, received 5000 francs for his victory. In total, he earned 7525 francs during the race; the average daily wages were around 5 to 7 francs.\nOther classifications.\nFifth-placed Charles Cruchon became the winner of the \"isolés\" category.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Octave Lapize the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification."

        "title": "1926 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1926 Tour de France was the 20th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 20 June to 18 July. It consisted of 17 stages with a total distance of 5745 km, ridden at an average speed of 24.064 km/h.\nThe longest tour in history, the route traced closely the borders of France. It was the first time that the race started outside Paris; in this way riders were forced to climb the mountains in the east of the country twice, once at the beginning of the race, and again at the end. The race was won by Belgian cyclist Lucien Buysse.\nInnovations.\nIn 1925, the number of stages had been increased from 15 (which was common since 1910) to 18 stages. In 1926, this was decreased to 17 stages. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange wanted to have longer stages, so the average stage length increased from 312 km per stage in 1925 to 338 km per stage in 1926.\nTeams.\nThere were 126 cyclists who started the Tour de France; 82 of them were touriste-routiers, cyclists who did not have the support from a team. The other 44 cyclists started the race in teams; some teams only had two cyclists.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe two teams with favourites were Automoto and Alcyon. The Automoto team had Ottavio Bottecchia, the winner of the last two editions of the race, and Lucien Buysse, the runner-up of the previous edition. The Alcyon team had Bartolomeo Aymo and Nicolas Frantz, third and fourth in 1925. They also had Adelin Benoit, and the Tour organisation thought that the battle would be between Bottecchia and Benoit.\nRace overview.\nJules Buysse started strong in the first stage, by finishing solo with a margin of more than 13 minutes. The second stage ended with a bunch sprint, so nothing changed in the general classification. In the third stage, he lost the lead to Gustaaf van Slembrouck. On that day, Lucien Buysse received the news that his daughter had died. He considered to leave the race, but decided to stay.\nThe next stages all ended in bunch sprints, with all the favourites in the first group. In the sixth stage, Félix Sellier won the sprint. However, the jury decided that he had not sprinted according to the rules, and he was set back to second place, making Joseph van Dam the winner.\nThe battle for the general classification seriously began in the tenth stage. That tenth stage was a tough stage, and has been labeled as the toughest stage ever in the Tour de France; 76 cyclists started the race at midnight, and more than seventeen hours later, Lucien Buysse arrived as the winner. After twenty-five minutes, the next cyclist came in. After one hour, only 10 cyclists had finished, so the Tour de France organisation sent cars to look for the cyclists. At midnight, 47 cyclists had arrived, some of them in buses. The race officials decided to allow the cyclists 40% more time than the winning cyclist. Later that night, 54 cyclists had crossed the finish line, and the remaining 22 cyclists were gathered; they were no longer in the race. After the stage, the race officials were approached by a man who claimed that he had brought some cyclists to the finish line with his car, but that the cyclists had not paid him. The officials decided not to punish the cyclists, and paid the driver. Gustaaf Van Slembrouck, wearing the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification, officially finished in 20th place, two hours behind Buysse. Year later, Van Slembrouck said that during the stage he had said to Tour organiser Desgrange that he was giving up, and Desgrange ordered a car to bring Van Slembrouck to the finish. The same stage with the same mountains had also been in the 1913 Tour de France; then the weather was better, and winner Philippe Thys only took 13 hours to finish the stage. One of the cyclists who had not finished the stage was the defending champion, Ottavio Bottecchia.\nWhen Buysse also won the next stage, his victory was assured, as he was leading by more than one hour. From that moment, Buysse saved his energy, and the race continued for the second place between Frantz and Aimo. At the end of the race, Frantz was in second place, only 26 seconds before Aimo.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nStage winners.\nIn 1926, there were no French stage winners. This was the first time that this happened, and has since only happened again in 1999.\nGeneral classification.\nThe race was won by Belgian Lucien Buysse.\nOther classifications.\nThe race for \"touriste-routiers\", cyclists who did not belong to a team and were allowed no assistance, was won by Italian Rossignoli.\nThe organising newspaper, l'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Lucien Buysse.\nAftermath.\nLucien Buysse announced after his win that he expected to win again in 1927, but because his sponsor Automoto had financial problems, they could not send a team to the Tours of 1927 and 1928, and Buysse only returned in 1929. Lucien Buysse would never finish the Tour de France again. The winner of the previous edition, Bottecchia, said that he would retire from cycling, after the difficulties he faced in the 1926 Tour de France.\nThe Tour de France organisation did not like the outcome of the 1926 Tour de France, as 10 of the 17 stages had finished in bunch sprints. For the next year, the rules were changed, and the flat stages were run as team time trials."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured Zimbabwe for cricket matches in August and September 2005. The Indians played in the Videocon Tri-Series in Zimbabwe, winning three of five matches but losing the final to finish second in the three-team tournament, and they played Zimbabwe for two Test matches in September 2005 (the Royal Stag test series). The hosts Zimbabwe were ninth out of ten teams in the ICC Test Championship, with their last win against the top eight Test nations coming in June 2001, against India. They did not manage to win a match here either, as India, led by the performances of fast bowler Irfan Pathan (who took 21 wickets), won the series 2–0 after an innings win in the first Test and a 10-wicket win in the second. India consolidated their third place in the Test championship with the win, which was also their first series win in Zimbabwe in four attempts.\nThis was also the final Test match contested in Zimbabwe before the team was suspended from Test cricket.\nODI series.\nIndia won three of five matches in this tournament, beating Zimbabwe twice in the group stage (by 161 runs and four wickets), and New Zealand once, but they lost the final and thus finished second out of the three teams.\nFirst-class leg.\nTour match: Zimbabwe Board XI v India, 8–10 September.\nMatch drawn\nDion Ebrahim fought off the bowling efforts of Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Anil Kumble to make 169 for Zimbabwe Board XI against India – the only Zimbabwean top-order batsman to pass 20, although number nine Keith Dabengwa made 60. Zimbabwe declared on 294 for 9, Kumble having taken five for 48, while Khan and Balaji leaked runs. Then, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid made centuries, and India eased to 572 for 9, with Graeme Cremer picking up four wickets. Balaji picked up the wicket of Terry Duffin for 0, but Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor added 96 as Zimbabwe batted out for the draw.\nFirst Test: India v Zimbabwe, 13–16 September.\nZimbabwe battled well on the first day of the two-Test series with India, as opening batsman Terry Duffin survived early jitters to become the first Zimbabwean to make a half-century on debut since Stuart Matsikenyeri, while the team made their highest score since the tour of Bangladesh last season. Duffin and Brendan Taylor started reasonably well, adding 25 before Taylor inside edged onto his pad and the ball popped up to Gautam Gambhir who took a good catch. Hamilton Masakadza stepped in, and looked quite settled before gloving the ball down the leg side to the wicket-keeper for 14. Dion Ebrahim survived with Duffin until lunch, however, as Zimbabwe made their way to 75 for 2.\nAfter lunch, Zimbabwe fought back, with Duffin hitting some technically sound boundaries. They brought up 100 in just over five overs after lunch, with no further loss, but Duffin was eventually dismissed lbw for 56 – out to a trademark inswinger from Irfan Pathan. Pathan got another wicket in his next over, as Dion Ebrahim was caught and bowled, and suddenly Zimbabwe could be looking at a familiar collapse, with the score 124 for 4.\nThe current and former captains of the Zimbabwe team, Tatenda Taibu and Heath Streak, had other thoughts, however. The pair added 70 in a fine rearguard effort, while not rejecting the odd high-scoring shot either, and frustrated the Indian bowlers for 25 overs. Eventually it was India's most experienced bowler, 34-year-old Anil Kumble, who broke the defences – Streak couldn't quite read the turn of the ball correctly, and was caught for 27. Kumble also dismissed young Charles Coventry for 2, leaving Taibu with all-rounder Andy Blignaut.\nBlignaut was strangely subdued for the 33 deliveries he faced, and although he did attempt some ODI-style heaves, they mostly missed both his bat and the off stump. Blignaut was eventually lbw for 4, but Keith Dabengwa came to the rescue with an entertaining 35 to bat out the day. He yielded a catch to VVS Laxman at first slip off Irfan Pathan in the second over of the morning, however, as Zimbabwe only managed to add ten to their overnight score for the loss of three wickets. Pathan was the pick of the Indian bowlers, swinging the ball well to dismiss Gavin Ewing and Blessing Mahwire as well, as Zimbabwe were all out for 279 – with Tatenda Taibu left not out for 71.\nHowever, in sunny conditions and on a good batting track, India found the going very easy. Admittedly Dabengwa dropped a hard catch off Virender Sehwag on 5, and Sehwag made the Zimbabweans pay, pounding six fours and one six in a 44 before Mahwire found a way through his defences at the stroke of lunch. India had added 88 for the first wicket, however, and although Gautam Gambhir departed for 46 shortly after lunch, the foundation was laid down. Rahul Dravid was back to his form from before the one-day series, and VVS Laxman also survived a tricky period to hit his eighth Test century. Mahwire added yet another wicket to his tally, as he lured Dravid into an edge that fell into Brendan Taylor's hands, but Laxman pounded Zimbabwe's bowlers in the evening session, giving them a relatively comfortable lead of 46 runs at stumps on day two.\nZimbabwe had a good morning session on the third day, by their standards, as Laxman was run out for 140 and Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were dismissed in successive overs. Captain Ganguly, however, held together well with the lower order, and he notched up the half-century along with his 5000th Test run before lunch, and India battled out the morning session with no further loss. And in the afternoon session, India's spinners took some beating. Dabengwa and Ewing bowled all but one over of the 37-over long session, despite Irfan Pathan defying the bowlers for 52 and Ganguly nurdling his way to 97 before tea, as Taibu seemed content with Ewing tying down the runs. He did not even do that very efficiently – by tea, his bowling analysis read 38–5–111–0, but he got a breakthrough three overs into the evening as the Indian captain smashed the ball straight to Dabengwa for 101. By the time, however, the Indian score had soared past 500, and in a frantic 40-ball feast at the end Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble combined to add 52 for the last two wickets.\nThe hosts did not put up as much fight in the second innings as in the first, however. During the course of 45 minutes, Irfan Pathan had removed four Zimbabwean batsmen – Taylor made 4, Masakadza 2, Ebrahim 2 and Streak a golden duck. Duffin, the discovery of the first innings, was also dismissed by Zaheer for 2. Only Taibu seemed vaguely comfortable against the swing bowler, and his partnership with Coventry at least added 49 runs on the board. However, in the last scheduled over of the day, Coventry gave a catch to Gambhir off Harbhajan Singh, resulting in Harbhajan's 200th Test wicket. Zimbabwe thus needed 208 for their last four wickets to avoid the innings defeat.\nZimbabwe resisted for a session on the fourth day against the Indian spinners, but Harbhajan and Anil Kumble chipped away with wickets, first by removing Blignaut for a well-struck 26, and then Taibu and Dabengwa in quick succession. Needing only one more wicket for the win, India attacked, but the fielder at short leg dropped Gavin Ewing early on and he answered by smashing the spin bowlers around. Ewing and Mahwire added 47 runs in 13 overs before Harbhajan finally got a ball to spin back into Ewing's pads – gone for 34, but at least he got a somewhat useful score. Nevertheless, Zimbabwe were all out for 185, and they suffered yet another innings defeat.\nSecond Test, Zimbabwe v India, 20–22 September.\nZimbabwe made one change from the previous Test, exchanging Ewing for Test debutante Waddington Mwayenga, gave the Indian slip fielders and wicket-keeper a lot of practice during the first morning of the second Test of the series, as four catches went to hand during the first 69 balls of the match. It started with Brendan Taylor, who edged to Rahul Dravid with the third delivery of the match, out for 4. Terry Duffin and Dion Ebrahim showed more patience, lasting for ten overs, but once Irfan Pathan found Duffin's outside edge Zimbabwe lost three wickets for no runs. Captain Tatenda Taibu, who had been top-scorer in both innings in the last Test, made a two-ball duck, while Dion Ebrahim was caught behind off Zaheer Khan, Zaheer's first wicket in the match. Heath Streak and Hamilton Masakadza survived for fifteen overs – four of them bowled by captain Sourav Ganguly, testing his skills with the swinging ball – but Streak eventually edged a ball from Harbhajan onto his pads and into the hands of Gautam Gambhir, leaving Zimbabwe at 75 for 5 at lunch.\nPathan continued the rout after the break, helped by Harbhajan, who snared Coventry for Zimbabwe's best score of the innings, a typical stroke-filled 37, including four fours and a six. After his nine-wicket-haul in the first match that left him with Man of the Match honours, Pathan now removed Masakadza, Blignaut, Dabengwa and Mahwire, to end with career best figures of seven for 59. Zimbabwe's innings had lasted 44.2 overs, yielded 161 runs (the Test debutant Mwayenga contributing with 14 not out from number 11) and included eight catches and two lbws.\nIndia's innings was as easy as it had been a week ago. From the first 12 overs, Sehwag and Gambhir added 75 runs, before Sehwag edged Streak behind for a run-a-ball 44. Gambhir continued, though, and India lost no further wickets until the close of play, leaving them on 195 for 1 with Gambhir five runs short of his second Test century. Rahul Dravid was more subdued, only making 49 from 103 balls, and he was occasionally troubled by Streak – but not enough to surrender his wicket.\nZimbabwe had better luck on day two, as the removal of Gautam Gambhir fifteen balls into the morning incited a return to accurate line and length bowling. The run rate was slow for today's Test cricket, as India accumulated only 2.46 runs per over in the first two sessions, including a period of 14 overs without a single boundary. India went defensive after losing Laxman for 8, and Dravid and Ganguly ground out the runs – only for Ganguly to depart for 16 shortly before lunch, giving Mwayenga his first Test wicket. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh pushed gently onwards after the break, adding 61 in 21 overs, but the new ball, delivered from the hands of Streak and Mahwire, caused them to miss the ball often. Eventually, Streak had Yuvraj Singh bowled with a fine inswinger, and Dravid followed two balls later, clean bowled by Mahwire for 98.\nStreak bowled an unbroken 14-over spell from the 80-over mark, with only the 15-minute tea break as respite, but the spell yielded a further three wickets – Pathan added another typically belligerent 32 before Charles Coventry held a catch, while wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik and Anil Kumble were both out in single figures, and Andy Blignaut ended the innings by dismissing Zaheer. Despite taking the last eight wickets for 200 runs – respectable by most measure – Zimbabwe had surrendered a 205-run lead, and their batting was not up to close that gap.\nIrfan Pathan was keen to emulate Streak's feat with the new ball, and he did, removing openers Duffin and Taylor to reach 18 wickets for the series. Zaheer, meanwhile, induced two catches in the gully as Zimbabwe lost the first four wickets for 21 runs. Masakadza and Streak survived until the close of play, adding a further 18, but the further 166 runs required to have India bat again looked enormous.\nStreak was dismissed early in the morning, but spirited innings from Coventry and Blignaut, along with Masakadza's third Test fifty, delayed the result somewhat, preventing Zimbabwe from suffering their sixth successive innings defeat. Coventry added a belligerent 25 before holing out to Ganguly at midwicket, while Blignaut was the beneficiary of five dropped chances by the Indian fielders – including three in an over bowled by Zaheer Khan. At the other end, however, the 22-year-old Masakadza composed 71, his highest Test score for four years and his third-highest score overall. Masakadza and Blignaut raced away, adding 151 before lunch, and they took the score to 201 for 6 before an all too familiar collapse struck. Masakadza started it, trapped lbw by Pathan, and Dabengwa and Mahwire both went for ducks. Zimbabwe needed three runs to avoid the innings defeat, and once they were provided, Blignaut started swinging. He hit two sixes after the departure of Mahwire, but debutant Mwayenga deserted him, lbw to Zaheer for 1.\nNeeding 20 to win, India hardly needed the 15-minute innings break – they wrapped it up with 14 deliveries, as they were handed the game with four leg side byes from Blignaut. Sehwag had hit three fours in a routine unbeaten 14 as India made it to 20 for no loss with ease."

        "title": "1949 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1949 Tour de France was the 36th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 30 June to 24 July. It consisted of 21 stages over .\nThe Italian team had internal problems, because Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi could both be the team leader. During the selection procedure, Coppi almost refused to start the race, but he was convinced to start. During the race, Coppi almost pulled out, because he felt he did not have full support from the team captain. In the Alps, Coppi recovered. The race was won by Coppi, with second place taken by teammate Bartali, the winner of the previous year. Coppi also won the mountains classification, while his Italian team won the team classification.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1949 Tour de France marked the first time that the Tour de France had a stage finish in Spain, when it stopped in San Sebastian in the ninth stage.\nWhile the mountains had been categorised into two categories in 1948, in 1949 the third category was added.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1949 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1949, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 12 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 6 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain. Italy and Belgium also sent two extra teams of young riders of 6 cyclists each.\nThe French regional cyclists were divided into four teams of 12 cyclists: Île-de-France, West/North, Centre/South-West and South-East. Altogether this made 120 cyclists. There were 57 French cyclists, 22 Italian, 18 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 6 Luxembourg, 6 Spanish, 6 Swiss and 1 Polish cyclist.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nIn the previous year, Fausto Coppi refused to enter the Tour de France because of personal problems with his teammate Gino Bartali. Bartali had won the previous Tour, and was trying to equal Philippe Thys by winning the Tour three times. Coppi had won the 1949 Giro d'Italia, and wanted to be the first one to achieve the Tour-Giro double in one year. The Italian team manager Alfredo Binda convinced them two weeks before the start of the race to join forces, so both Italians were in the race.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1949 Tour de France started on 30 June, and had four rest days, in Les Sables-d'Olonne, Pau, Cannes and Aosta. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 17.\nRace overview.\nIn the early stages, Bartali and Coppi both lost time. Before the fifth stage, Coppi and Bartali both were not in the top fifteen of the general classification.\nIn that fifth stage, Coppi escaped together with the leader of the general classification, Jacques Marinelli. When they were leading by 6 minutes, Coppi and Marinelli fell in Mouen. Marinelli was not hurt and could continue, but Coppi's bike was broken. The Italian team car offered him a new one, but Coppi refused because he wanted his personal spare bike, and threatened to quit the race.\nWhen Bartali reached Coppi, he saw the problem, and waited. Even later, the Italian team captain Binda arrived with Coppi's spare bike, and Bartali and Coppi started to ride. Coppi started to slow down, complaining he was hungry and exhausted. Bartali decided he could not wait anymore, and rode away from Coppi. Coppi came in 18 minutes late that stage.\nLater that night, it became clear that Coppi had been angry because the team leader had not been following him, even though he was in the leading group. Coppi did not want to race in a team where Bartali and not he was the leader. Binda tried to convince Coppi that he had been delayed, and he succeeded in keeping Coppi in the race.\nIn the Alps, Coppi recovered. In the sixteenth stage, Coppi escaped, and only Bartali followed him. It was Bartali's 35th birthday, and Coppi gave Bartali the stage victory. After that stage, Bartali was first in the general classification, with Coppi in second place, 82 seconds behind.\nIn stage 17, Bartali and Coppi again were leading together. Around 40 km into the stage, Bartali punctured. Coppi waited for Bartali, but when Bartali later fell and twisted his ankle, team leader Binda allowed Coppi to take off alone. Coppi did so, won the stage, and decided the race.\nThat seventeenth stage finished in the Italian town Aosta. Many Italians had come to see the Tour de France, to cheer on their Italian heroes Coppi and Bartali but also to express their anger against the French cyclists, specifically Jean Robic, who had said in an interview that he could beat those Italians easily. Insults were shouted against non-Italians in the Tour, and some windows of French cars were smashed. For safety, and because there were not enough telephone connections for the journalists, most Tour officials and journalists decided to spend the night in Switzerland.\nWhen the Tour returned to France in the nineteenth stage to Colmar, some French spectators took revenge by throwing tomatoes and rocks towards the Italian cyclists and followers. The organisation apologised for this behavior, and the Italian cyclists accepted this apology.\nIn the rest of the race, Coppi's lead was not endangered; Coppi won the mountain time trial in stage 20, and won the Tour with a margin of more than ten minutes over Bartali.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 120 cyclists, 55 finished the race.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. There were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 5 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team. The Italy Cadets and Switzerland finished with two cyclists each, so they were not eligible for this classification.\nThe Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 15. This prize was won by Paul Giguet. The special award for the best regional rider was won by third-placed Jacques Marinelli.\nAftermath.\nAs Coppi had also won the 1949 Giro d'Italia, he became the first person to achieve the Giro-Tour double.\nAfter the unrest in Aosta and Colmar, there were doubts if the Italian cyclists would return in 1950, and if that Tour should pass through Italy again. At the start of the 1950 Tour de France, the Italian team was present and the Tour was scheduled to go through Italy, but after further incidents the Italian team left the race, and the stage through Italy was rerouted.\nCoppi would go on to repeat the Giro-Tour double in 1952."

        "text": "The South Africa A cricket team are touring Sri Lanka in September and October 2005. South Africa A are a team made up of the second tier of South African cricketers, just below the national team. They played Sri Lanka A for two first class matches, and the hosts won the first by a convincing margin. Sri Lanka were also looking on course to win the second but for an attritional batting effort from Hashim Amla and Johan Botha, who lasted 41 overs to draw the final game, meaning that the hosts won the two match series 1–0. Sanjeewa Weerakoon took 19 wickets in two games for Sri Lanka A, while opening batsman Avishka Gunawardene impressed with the bat, scoring 207 runs in four innings. For South Africa, no one individual really impressed, as captain Jacques Rudolph was the top-scorer 149 runs in four innings while Monde Zondeki took nine wickets at an average of 20.77. The tourists now start a three-team one-day tournament, also including New Zealand A.\nSchedule.\nThis is for the first-class series only. For the one-day series, please see Sri Lanka A-team Tri-Series in 2005-06.\nMatch details.\nSri Lanka Development XI v South Africa A, 4–5 September.\nMatch drawn\nIn a match shortened to one day by rain, South Africa A declared on 172 for 6, Jacques Rudolph top-scoring with 37 while Dilruwan Perera took two for 51. Two players retired. In 39 overs, the Development XI were bowled out to 139 for 9, Paul Adams taking three for 18 and Justin Ontong two for 28. Amila Sandaruwan top scored with 41 as the hosts made 148 for 9.\nCricinfo scorecard\nTour match, Sri Lanka A v South Africa A, 7–9 September.\nSri Lanka A won by six wickets\nA strong Sri Lanka A side, including three players who appeared in the recent ODI series against Bangladesh, converted a 21-run first innings defeat into a comfortable six-wicket victory. Sri Lanka A had put South Africa A in to bat, but conceded 68 runs to the opening partnership of Andrew Puttick and Jacques Rudolph. Three Sri Lankan bowlers got wickets, yet South Africa fought well to make it to 157 for 3. But then Sajeewa Weerakoon started a burst, as three wickets fell in 13 balls without the scoreboard ticking over. Johan Botha stayed in for 90 minutes, allowing Zander de Bruyn to hit out, but Weerakoon returned to end with figures of six for 59, while de Bruyn was left stranded on 100. South Africa's bowlers shared out wickets, Monde Zondeki taking three for 54 as Sri Lanka A crashed to 126 for 6. However, spinner Kaushal Lokuarachchi made an entertaining half-century, and despite three wickets from Paul Adams, Sri Lanka A made it to 224.\nIn the second innings, Weerakoon got his best first-class returns, dismissing four South African batsmen for 0 - including centurion de Bruyn - as South Africa collapsed twice, first from 71 for 1 to 89 for 6, and then from 171 for 7 to 173. Weerakoon ended with seven for 47 - for a match total of 13 for 106 - as Sri Lanka A were set 200 to win. Avishka Gunawardene repaired his first-innings duck, making 83 as Sri Lanka A chased down the target with ease - Zondeki getting the best figures again, but this time only one wicket for 27. Cricinfo scorecard\nTour match: Sri Lanka A v South Africa A, 14–16 September.\nMatch drawn\nThis match was moved from Kandy to Dambulla due to a waterlogged ground at the Asgiriya Stadium, and consequently shortened from four to three days as the plans had to be reorganised. In addition, a wet pitch shortened the first day to 65 overs, but when it finally got underway South Africa A immediately established dominance. Zondeki got three wickets early on, as the hosts made it to 99 for 5, but an entertaining 45-run stand between Tharanga and Lokuhettige took Sri Lanka past 150. Charith Jayaweera also hit three fours in a half-hour unbeaten 17, and Sri Lanka A posted 206 in 48 overs. Jacques Rudolph and Hashim Amla were in control of the bowlers in the evening session, making their way to 71 for 1, but Weerakoon continued on his fantastic series with six wickets - including Rudolph, Amla and Zander de Bruyn - for 66 runs. South Africa A were reeling on 148 for 6, but Tyron Henderson blitzed his way to 50, adding 72 in 12 overs with Paul Adams, as the tourists earned a 48-run lead.\nSouth Africa A once again got a good start with the ball, Zondeki getting Tharanga and Ian Daniel out caught, but Lokuhettige once again defied them, as he and captain Gunawardene were batting on the third morning with a slender lead of 127. Lokuhettige hit six fours and one six on the way to 51, and his 79-run partnership brought Sri Lanka out of trouble. Johan Botha eventually had him caught, but the damage had been done, and Gunawardene could also get his century as Sri Lanka A set the tourists 219 to win. South Africa A were immediately set on the back foot, losing openers Puttick and Rudolph early to have the score at five runs for two wickets, and Jayaweera then took three wickets as South Africa A struggled to 57 for 5. Jayaweera, however, was not allowed to bowl, possibly due to the light conditions, and Weerakoon went wicketless as Amla and Botha survived 41 overs and two and a half hours to draw the game. Nevertheless, the hosts won the series 1–0."

        "title": "Muslim World League",
        "text": "The Muslim World League (MWL; ) is an international Islamic NGO based in Mecca, Saudi Arabia that promotes what it calls the true message of Islam by advancing moderate values that promote peace, tolerance and love.\nThe NGO has been funded by the Saudi government from its inception in 1962, with that contribution growing to approximately $13 million by 1980. Because of the Saudi funding, the League is widely recognized as a representative of the Islamic principles promoted in that country. Under Saudi Arabia's modernization agenda, Vision 2030, the country has embraced a moderate form of Islam, which the Muslim World League seeks to promote in Saudi Arabia and around the world. \"The Oxford Dictionary of Islam\" says that \"the group has acted as a mouthpiece for the Saudi Arabian government, which finances it.\"\nMuhammad bin Abdul Karim Issa is the General Secretary. The organization propagates the religion of Islam, encouraging Dawah and conversion of non-Muslims, and rebuke and debunk criticism of Islam. The organization funds the construction of mosques, financial reliefs for Muslims afflicted by natural disasters, the distribution of copies of the Quran, and political tracts on Muslim minority groups. The League says that they reject all acts of violence and promote dialogue with the people of other cultures, within their understanding of Sharia, but they are no strangers to controversy, having been the subject of several ongoing counterterrorism investigations in the U.S. related to Hamas, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.\nIn its 2019 Country Reports on Terrorism, the U.S. State Department stated that the Muslim World League's Secretary General, Dr. Al-Issa \"pressed a message of interfaith dialogue, religious tolerance, and peaceful coexistence with global religious authorities, including Muslim imams outside the Arab world,\" as well as conducted extensive outreach to prominent U.S. Jewish and Christian leaders.\nThe League founded the International Islamic Relief Organization in 1978.\nHistory.\nThe Muslim World League was founded in accordance with a resolution adopted during the meeting of the General Islamic Conference which was held in Makkah on the 14th of Dhul Hijjah 1381 Hijra, corresponding to 18 May 1962.\nFollowing a meeting of 22 Muslim religious leaders held in 1962, the Muslim World League saw the light under the auspices of then Crown prince Faisal.\nThe Muslim World League has had eight Secretaries General since its founding. Under Secretary General Dr. Al-Issa, the Muslim World League has embraced a notable shift in objectives and priorities, breaking long-held taboos in the Muslim world to reflect the organization's obligation to promote the values of true Islam and demonstrate responsible leadership.\nObjectives.\nThe Muslim World League's mission is to introduce Islam and the moderate values presented in the Quran and Sunnah. Further, the Muslim World League seeks to spread a message of \"peace and harmony\" that strengthens Islam's resolve and unity around the world. The organization also combats extremist ideology by promoting and clarifying the facts through education, traditional, digital and social media, and international conferences.\nThe Muslim World League claims to not only defend the rights of Muslim minorities, but all minorities that face discrimination, and overt and covert forms of oppression. The Washington Times quoted the League's Secretary General saying that the organization \"embraces the full range of Muslim beliefs and seeks to downplay sectarian divides – including that between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.\" In regards to protecting the rights of minorities outside of Islam, the Muslim World League's leadership wrote in a 2019 Newsweek opinion editorial piece that the Charter of Makkah \"demands that we preserve the human rights of all people, including women and minorities.\"\nAccording to the Muslim World League's website, the organization places significant emphasis on civilizational rapprochement through constructive dialogue and engagement. In 2018, Dr. Al-Issa stated that Muslims and non-Muslims alike have an obligation to call for civilizational rapprochement that promotes and shares values and common interests, \"in addition to the advancement of the concept of human brotherhood that calls for reinforcing the feeling of love, cooperation and understanding.\" Additionally, the organization promotes peaceful and harmonious coexistence between Islam and the world's largest religions, especially, but not limited to, Christianity and Judaism.\nEach year, the Muslim World League utilizes the Hajj season to gather respected Islamic voices, scholars and leaders in Mecca, Saudi Arabia to exchange views and discuss how to best raise the standards and promote true moderate Islamic principles around the world. The Muslim World League also gathers and meets with global thought leaders, scholars, intellectuals, local and national community leaders, and heads of organizations to find solutions to the array of issues facing the world today.\nCharter of Makkah.\nIn 2019, the Muslim World League largely contributed to the conception and realization of the Charter of Makkah, a landmark agreement that aims to provide Muslims with the true, moderate and inclusive principles of Islam.\nTh Charter of Makkah, signed during a historic gathering of more than 1,200 Islamic scholars, Imams and leaders from 139 countries, consists of 30 unique principle points that call for the world to combat extremism and hatred, fight against injustice and oppression, and reject violations of human rights in all its forms. The Charter strives to articulate the need for equality, religious harmony and tolerance, women empowerment, and coexistence.\nFounding Charter.\nWe the members of the Muslim World League, representing it religiously, hereby undertake before God, Almighty to:\n· Discharge our obligation towards God, by conveying and proclaiming His Message all over the world. We also reaffirm our belief that there shall be no peace in the world without the application of the principles of Islam.\n· Invite all communities to vie with one another for the common good and happiness of mankind, establish social justice and a better human society.\n· Call upon God to bear witness that we do not intend to undermine, dominate or practice hegemony over anyone else. Hence, in order to further these goals, we intend to:\n· Unite the ranks of the Muslims, and remove all divisive forces from the midst of the Muslim communities around the world.\n· Remove obstacles in the way of establishing the Muslim world union.\n· Support all advocates of charitable deeds.\n· Utilize our spiritual as well as material and moral potentialities in furthering the aims of this charter.\n· Unify efforts in order to achieve these purposes in a positive and practical way.\n· Reject all the pre-tenses of ancient as well as contemporary Jahiliah (attitudes of the pre-Islamic era).\n· Always reaffirm the fact that Islam has no place for either regionalism or racism.\nStructure.\nOffice of the Secretary General.\nThe Office of the Secretary General of the Muslim World League is the executive wing of the organization. It supervises the day-to-day activities of the MWL, and implements the policies and resolutions adopted by the Constituent Council. The office includes the Secretary General, assistant secretaries and the general staff. The Secretariat's headquarters is located in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\nMuhammad bin Abdul Karim Issa is the current secretary general of the Muslim World League.\nSubsidiary bodies.\nThe MWL is organized into six subsidiary bodies under the oversight of the Secretary General. \nThe Supreme Council\nComprising sixty prominent Muslim scholars, the Constituent Council is the highest authority within the MWL. The Constituent Council makes policy recommendations to the Secretary General. It includes representatives from various sects of Islam, ensuring the representation of the various Muslim communities around the world within the Muslim World League.\nThe World Supreme Council for Mosques\nThe World Supreme Council for Mosques seeks to provide resources and protection for mosques around the world.\nThe WSCM has an independent legal personality. It aims at reactivating the mission of the Mosque as a vital focal point of the religious as well as the temporal life of the Muslim. Ultimately, the WSCM aims at restoring the Mosque's role to what it was during the early days of Islam. It also strives to protect Mosques and Islamic trusts against assault, and to maintain the sanctity and purity of the Mosque. The WSCM was founded in compliance with a resolution adopted by the \"Message of the Mosque\" conference, which was held in Holy Makkah during the month of Ramadan 1395 (September 1975) under the auspices of the Muslim World League.\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council\nFiqh is Islamic jurisprudence, seeking solutions to the problems for which the Qur’an does not give clear instructions. Within the Muslim World League, the Islamic Fiqh Council composed of a select group of Muslim jurists and scholars who consider the serious issues concerning the Muslim Ummah.\nThe International Organization for Relief, Welfare and Development\nThe International Organization for Relief, Welfare, and Development is among the most active organizations within the Muslim World League. Founded in 1978 in Saudi Arabia as the International Islamic Relief Organization, it provides aid to Muslim and non-Muslim communities in need around the world. \nIn 2019, the International Organization for Relief, Welfare and Development completed the League Boreholes Project in Ghana to provide clean drinking water to several communities. \nThe organization has sponsored several health centers in Africa, including surgery centers in Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Burundi, and Zimbabwe.\nThe centers provide cataract surgery free of charge to elderly patients.\nAdditionally, the organization has sponsored several orphanages, providing educational materials, clothing, and security to vulnerable children in Pakistan, Ghana, and elsewhere.\nThe International Organization for the Quran and Sunnah\nThe International Organization for the Quran and Sunnah is dedicated to assisting scholars in teaching and memorizing the Quran. The Muslim World League's International Organization for the Quran and Sunnah strives to ensure the values of true Islam permeate the work and teachings of Muslim scholars around the world.\nThe World Organization of Muslim Scholars\nThe World Organization of Muslim Scholars was founded in 2003 as a resolution of the Fourth General Islamic Conference. The organization serves to unite and clarify the attitudes of Muslim scholars and intellectuals as they address the emerging challenges facing Muslim communities around the world.\nActivities.\nUnder Secretary General Dr. Al-Issa, the MWL frequently participates in and hosts international events, in addition to playing an active role in humanitarian aid projects around the world.\nCommemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz.\nIn January 2020, Dr. Al-Issa became the most senior Muslim leader to visit the German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. Leading up to the anniversary, Dr. Al-Issa published an opinion editorial in The Washington Post, \"Why Muslims around the world should remember the Holocaust,\" decrying the practice of Holocaust denial.\nAs part of this visit, Dr. Al-Issa lit candles before the Death Wall at Auschwitz I and the International Monument at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Al-Issa also visited the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Nozyk Synagogue, the only surviving prewar Jewish house of prayer in Warsaw. In an article published by the American Jewish Committee, Dr. Al-Issa stated on his visit to Auschwitz, \"To be here, among the children of Holocaust survivors and members of the Jewish and Islamic communities, is both a sacred duty and a profound honor. The unconscionable crimes to which we bear witness today are truly crimes against humanity. That is to say, a violation of us all, an affront to all of God’s children.\"\nInternational Conferences.\nScandinavia Symposiums\nIn November 2019, the Muslim World League partnered with the Scandinavian Council for Relations, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting interreligious dialogue and diversity in Scandinavia. Together, the Muslim World League and Scandinavian Council for Relations hosted three symposiums in Copenhagen, Denmark; Oslo, Norway; and Stockholm, Sweden to address global issues like national identify, intellectual security, human brotherhood and human trafficking.\nThe Paris International Conference for Peace and Solidarity\nIn September 2019, the Muslim World League joined the Foundation for Islam in France to host the Paris International Conference for Peace and Solidarity. The symposium concluded with a Memorandum of Understanding and Friendship between leaders of the Abrahamic religions in France. The memorandum was signed by Mr. Haim Korsia, Chief Rabbi of France; Mr. François Clavairoly, President of the Council of Christian Churches in France; Monsignor Emmanuel Adamakis, President of the Assembly of Orthodox Bishops of France; and Dr. Al-Issa. The witnesses of the agreement included Moché Lewin, vice-president of the Conference of European Rabbis; Father Vincent Feroldi, Director of the National Service for Relations with Muslims of the Conference of Bishops of France; and Ghaleb Bencheikh, President of the Foundation of Islam in France.\nResponsible Leaders Summit\nIn May 2019, the Centre for Responsible Leadership, a partnership between the Muslim World League and the World Council for Religious Leaders hosted the inaugural Responsible Leaders Summit at the United Nations. Leaders from business, finance, religion, politics, media, and the environment participated in high-level workshops in an effort to solve some of the world's greatest challenges.\nThe five solution sessions addressed: Restoring Civility to Public Discourse; Economic Inequality; Safeguarding Our Planet; Uniting the Faithful; and Ensuring Gender Equality. The day-long symposium concluded with an awards ceremony, presenting the 2019 Responsible Leadership Awards to: Ann Curry for Truth in Media; Alex Gorsky for Engaged Leadership; Christian Rynning-Tønnesen for Excellence in Sustainability; and Rabbi Arthur Schneier for A Lifetime of Achievement.\nThe General Islamic Conference.\nThe General Islamic Conference is the highest policy making body that expresses the feelings and aspirations of Muslim peoples around the world. It is the source of the League's legitimacy and capacity as the spokesman of Muslims worldwide. The GIC consists of leading Islamic preachers and activists who meet annually to review major issues facing Islam and Muslims and to find appropriate solutions for the realization of Muslim interests and aspirations.\n\"The GIC has met on several occasions so far as follows:\"\nIn 1974, the League declared that Ahmadis and related groups are out of the fold of Islam, banned from the Holy lands and should be boycotted socially, economically and culturally \nIn 2015, Abdallah Ben Abdel Mohsen At-Turki spoke on behalf of the speakers at the conference and commenting on the violence caused by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, he said: \"The terrorism that we face within the Muslim Ummah and our own homelands today … is religiously motivated. It has been founded on extremism, and the misconception of some distorted Sharia concept.\"\nHalal certification.\nThe MWL has a number of regionally based Islamic cultural centres that oversee the certification of halal meat products in various countries around the world. Only meat approved by MWL-affiliated centres can be imported to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Much of its work in this field is organised through the International Islamic Halal Organization, a constituent body of the MWL founded to spread awareness of the importance of halal foods.\nAid for stranded Pakistanis.\nIn 1988, the Muslim World League (together with Al Falah and Heed International) came forward and established pucca houses for the Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh.\nPublications.\nThe Muslim World League publishes the monthly Journal of the Muslim World League in Arabic and English. It also publishes a weekly News of the Muslim World.\nControversy.\nIn October 2001, Newsweek writer Evan Thomas reported that \"Two interrelated global charities directly financed by the Saudi government--the International Islamic Relief Organization and the Muslim World League --have been used by bin Laden to finance his operations. The organizations were left off the list of groups sanctioned by the United States last week, U.S. officials hinted to NEWSWEEK, in order to avoid embarrassing the Saudi government.\"\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the MWL has frequently been a platform for anti-Israeli rhetoric. In 2008, it invited Yusuf al-Qaradawi to speak at their first International Islamic Conference on Dialogue in Mecca in June 2008. During his speech at the conference, he said he would \"never sit with Jews on one platform and never hold dialogue with those Jews who have committed injustice against us and support Israel.\""

It was called the Little World Series (no relation to the Little League World Series) until 1932, and acquired other official names at different times.\nThe various iterations of the Junior World Series were played for most of the years of the 20th century, off and on depending on the fortunes of the various leagues involved. Most often it was held between the champions of the International League (IL) and the American Association (AA). This left the third, and sometimes stronger, minor circuit called the Pacific Coast League (PCL) out of this minor league championship series. After not being held in 1972 and 1974, the last Junior World Series was held in 1975.\nThe Junior World Series was superseded by the Triple-A Classic, held from 1988 to 1991. Then, from 1998 to 2000, the Triple-A World Series pitted the IL and PCL champs (as the AA had folded in 1997).

The events began on 11 February and ended on 20 February 1992. The 1992 Games were the first in which women competed in biathlon.\nRussian biathlete Sergei Tarasov admitted in 2015 that the EUN (former Soviet nations competing in a unified team) biathlon team had carried out illegal blood transfusions at the Games. Something went very wrong with his transfusion, and he was rushed to the hospital where they saved his life.\nMedal summary.\nSix nations won medals in biathlon, Germany leading the medal table with seven (3 gold, 4 silver). The Unified Team was the only other team to win more than two medals. Mark Kirchner led the individual medal table with two golds and three medals total, while Antje Misersky-Harvey also won three medals, one gold and two silver.\nFrance's gold medal in the relay was the country's first medal of any type in the sport. Canada's bronze, won by Myriam Bédard, was the first medal won by an athlete from outside Europe or the former Soviet Union.\nParticipating nations.\nTwenty-eight nations sent biathletes to compete in the events. Below is a list of the competing nations; in parentheses are the number of national competitors. Three former Soviet republics (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), made their biathlon debuts, along with Slovenia and Greece. The Unified Team also made its only appearance."

        "title": "Mapei (cycling team)",
        "text": "Mapei was an Italian-based road bicycle racing team active from 1993 to 2002, named after sponsoring firm Mapei. \nMapei was one of the strongest teams during the late 1990s, and ranked as the strongest UCI team in 1994–2000 and 2002.\nHistory.\nWhile started in 1993 (taking the Eldor-Viner team midseason), the Mapei team already became an international top team one year later when it merged with the Spanish Clas-Cajastur for the 1994 season. Clas had been a cycling sponsor since the 1988 Clas-Razesa team, led by José Manuel Fuente Lavandera. Among the Clas-riders who joined the Italian Mapei team were Fernando Escartín, Abraham Olano and, most prominently, Swiss top rider Tony Rominger. Other newly signed riders included Franco Ballerini, Gianluca Bortolami, Andrea Tafi and Mauro Gianetti, forming a Spanish-Italian top team with two strong Swiss riders as well.\nAlready in 1995, Clas stopped sponsoring, being replaced by GB. GB had previously sponsored the Italian MG–Maglificio team, which has had success in the early nineties in part due to a Flemish influence. Along with the new sponsor came team manager Patrick Lefevere and top rider Johan Museeuw, marking the beginning of the Belgian influence of the successful Mapei team in the following years, although the team would always have some strong Spanish riders. Another new rider in 1995 was Frank Vandenbroucke, who joined from the Lotto team.\nIn the remainder of the 1990s, Mapei would celebrate many major successes, usually in the one-day classics. The team had the great Belgian and Italian classic specialists of the 1990s such as Johan Museeuw, Michele Bartoli, Andrea Tafi, Franco Ballerini, and had Patrick Lefevere as directeur sportif and then manager. The team won Paris–Roubaix five times. Three times (1996, 1998 and 1999) the team even won the first three places. In the 1996 edition, the sprint for the line was decided 15 km from the finish. Directeur sportif Patrick Lefevere, who was following the race in the team car, talked with the owner of Mapei, Giorgio Squinzi (in Milan), who said that Museeuw was to win the race. Gianluca Bortolami was second while Andrea Tafi was third. In 1998 Franco Ballerini won the race with over four minutes ahead of his two teammates Tafi and Wilfried Peeters. and in 1999 Tafi won with an advantage of two minutes over teammates Peeters and Tom Steels. In the summer of 2000, Lefevre announced that the Belgian part of the Mapei team would be leaving the team to form a new team called Domo–Farm Frites which had Museeuw as team captain. As a result, there was a great rivalry between the two teams.\nMapei was less dominating in the Grand Tours. The only true stage race specialist was Tony Rominger, who won the 1994 Vuelta a España and the 1995 Giro d'Italia for the team. As Rominger focused on the Tour de France in 1996, Abraham Olano was given the leadership role at the Giro d'Italia in 1996. Olano took the maglia rosa but lost it in the mountains and during the Tour, Rominger lost time in the mountains. The team never played a major role in the Tour de France.\nFrom 2003 Mapei dropped their sponsorship, and a new team was built on top of the old with the name of Quick-Step–Davitamon.\nTeam names.\nThe official names of the team changed with the cosponsors several times. The team has run under the following names: \"Mapei\" (1993) \"Mapei–Clas\" (1994), \"Mapei–GB\" (1995–1997), \"Mapei–Bricobi\" (1998), \"Mapei–Quickstep\" (1999–2002).\nJerseys.\nThe Mapei team jersey was first produced by Parentini and featured numerous colourful cubes from the main sponsor's product packaging. In the team's second year, Sportful (owned by Manifattura Valcismon S.p.A.) provided all technical garments from 1994 until the penultimate year, when Santini SMS took over in the final year."

        "text": "Jim Bates (born May 31, 1946) is a former American football coach in the National Football League (NFL), most recently serving as defensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He primarily ran a 4–3 scheme, using fast, undersized linebackers. Bates served as interim head coach for the Miami Dolphins during the 2004 NFL season.\nCoaching career.\nCollegiate coaching.\nBates' coaching career began as a graduate assistant with the Tennessee Volunteers in 1968. Bates then spent the next three seasons as head coach at Sevier County High School in Sevierville, Tennessee, before returning to the collegiate ranks with the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles in 1972. In 1973, he coached the offensive line for the Villanova Wildcats and the linebackers coach in 1974. Bates spent the 1975–1976 seasons as the Kansas State Wildcats' linebackers coach. Bates spent the 1977 season as a secondary coach with the West Virginia Mountaineers. He held the same position with the Texas Tech Red Raiders from 1978 to 1979 before being promoted to defensive coordinator from 1980 through 1983.\n1985.\nBates began his professional coaching career in the USFL with the San Antonio Gunslingers, replacing retiring head coach Gil Steinke for the team's 1985 season. After 12 games, Bates resigned as head coach following the club's failure to pay its players over the course of several preceding weeks.\n1989.\nServed as a Linebackers Coach for the University of Tennessee\n1990.\nWhen Steve Spurrier was hired as the new head football coach for the University of Florida in 1990, Spurrier hired Bates as his first defensive coordinator for his Florida Gators football team. Bates' hard-hitting defense and Spurrier's offensive scheme helped the Gators to a 17–13 upset win over the Alabama Crimson Tide, and resounding victories over the LSU Tigers (34–8), the Auburn Tigers (48–7), the Georgia Bulldogs (38–7) and the Kentucky Wildcats (47–15). The Gators finished 9–2 overall, and 6–1 in the Southeastern Conference—the best record in the conference. They would finish 11th in the country averaging 15.5 PA per game.\n1991–2004.\nBates began his National Football League coaching career with the Cleveland Browns as their defensive line coach in 1991, where he served under head coach Bill Belichick and defensive coordinator Nick Saban, who would succeed him as Dolphins head coach in 2005.\nHe then moved on to the Atlanta Falcons to serve as defensive coordinator in 1994, his first time at this position. It would only last one year, however, and Bates returned to the Browns to coach their secondary in 1995 when Saban left to take the head coaching position at Michigan State. Bates was fired along with Belichick and his entire staff by owner Art Modell on February 9, 1996, the day NFL owners approved the Browns' move to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens.\nIn 1996, Bates was hired by the Dallas Cowboys as their linebackers coach under Barry Switzer. He was promoted to assistant coach/defensive line in 1998 by new head coach Chan Gailey.\nIn 2000, the Miami Dolphins hired him as their defensive coordinator. \nUnder Bates, the Dolphins defense finished no lower than 10th in the NFL in yards allowed from 2000 to 2004.\n2004–2005.\nHis first head coaching job in the NFL came in 2004 when he was named interim head coach for the Miami Dolphins following the resignation of Dave Wannstedt. He went 3-4 (including a Monday Night victory over the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots) with the underachieving Dolphins, who had started 1-8 under Wannstedt. When Saban took over the team, it soon became clear that Bates was not part of his plans, and Bates took over the defensive coordinator job with the Green Bay Packers.\n2006.\nWhen Mike Sherman was fired by Packers General Manager Ted Thompson on January 2, 2006, Bates was offered the opportunity to interview for the head position. He interviewed on January 10 but was informed the next day the organization would be hiring San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McCarthy instead.\nBates took the news very hard. McCarthy met with him on January 15 in hopes of convincing him to stay with the organization. However, after two meetings between McCarthy and Bates, the team announced on January 16 that they would be parting ways.\nBates did not take another coaching job in the NFL in 2006.\n2007.\nIn early January 2007, Bates was signed on by the Denver Broncos to replace Larry Coyer as the defensive coordinator. However, Defensive Backs coach Bob Slowik was promoted to the defensive coordinator position (nominal), and Bates was named \"Assistant Head Coach/Defense.\" In the 2007 season, the Broncos defense went from 9th ranked in the league in scoring in 2006 to 29th in 2007 as of week 13. On January 8, 2008, Bates announced he was leaving the Denver Broncos.\n2009.\nOn January 22, 2009, he was announced as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Defensive Coordinator, working with new head coach Raheem Morris. After a 1–9 start into the season, Bates was relieved of his duties by Morris on November 24, 2009.\nScheme.\nBates' defensive scheme uses the defensive tackles to plug the middle, with the defensive ends pressuring the quarterback. Special emphasis is on the linebackers, as short, speedy LB's are especially fitted for this format. Linebacker Zach Thomas and defensive end Jason Taylor are among the players Bates developed in Miami. Bates is well liked among players for being a fiery, energetic, demanding, yet fair and hands-on coach.\nPersonal life.\nA graduate of the University of Tennessee, Bates now lives in Oneida, Wisconsin. His son, Jeremy, has been an offensive coach for several professional and college teams, including a stint as the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks. James Bates, his oldest son, played linebacker for the Florida Gators and was a captain on the Gators' 1996 Florida Gators football team, and where Jim served as a defensive coordinator, Bates works as A Color commentator on the ACC Network and raycom Sports His daughter Jennifer, was previously a television sports reporter and news anchor at KWCH, the CBS affiliate in Wichita, Kansas. He is currently a sports broadcaster and working artist.\nBates is a 1964 graduate of Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan. He earned 10 varsity letters in 4 sports before accepting an offer to play football at Tennessee. Bates was named to the school's athletic hall of fame.\nBates currently resides in Florida.\nReferences.\nhttps://www.cwtvpr.com/the-cw/shows/atlantic-coast-conference-acc-football/talent/?view=james-bates#:~:text=%E2%80%8BJames%20Bates%20is%20the,football%20on%20The%20CW%20Network"

        "title": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground",
        "text": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground, also known as the County Ground or Edgbaston Stadium, is a cricket ground in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham, England. It is home to Warwickshire County Cricket Club and its T20 team Birmingham Bears. Edgbaston has also been the venue for Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. Edgbaston has hosted the T20 Finals Day more than any other cricket ground. Edgbaston is the main home ground for the Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred competition from 2021.\nEdgbaston was the first English ground outside Lord's to host a major international one-day tournament final when it hosted the ICC Champions Trophy final in 2013. With permanent seating for approximately 25,000 spectators, it is the fourth-largest cricketing venue in England, after Lord's, Old Trafford and The Oval.\nEdgbaston has played host to matches in major tournaments as it hosted matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 where England won its first World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 where Pakistan won. \nEdgbaston also hosted the first women's T20 event at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games where Australia won the gold medal match. \nEdgbaston was the venue of the first senior game under floodlights in English cricket in July 1997 between Warwickshire and Somerset in the then AXA Life Sunday League and hosted the first day/night Test match in England in August 2017 when England played the West Indies.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe land that now makes up Edgbaston Cricket Ground was originally owned by the Calthorpe Estate, who have now sold the site onto Wylam Investments (Edgbaston Holdings) on a long lease. Calthorpe Estates had developed the manor of Edgbaston into an exclusive Birmingham suburb over the course of the 19th century, and believed that a cricket ground would be an asset that would add to the genteel image of the area. Warwickshire County Cricket Club had considered Rugby and Leamington Spa for their headquarters, but club secretary William Ansell believed that Birmingham's large population and comprehensive railway connections made it preferable – envisaging first-class status for the county and Test status for the ground.\nThe club had initially favoured the Wycliffe Ground on Pershore Road, but were instead offered a 12-acre \"meadow of rough grazing land\" in an undeveloped area on the banks of the River Rea by the Calthorpe Estate – the less attractive development land having more to gain from association with the cricket ground. With the site only 20 minutes' walk from New Street Station, Warwickshire agreed in 1885 to lease the land for £5 per acre over a 21-year period. A further £1,250 was spent on draining and enclosing the site and building a wooden pavilion. The new ground's first match took place on 7 June 1886 against the MCC, watched by 3,000 spectators over two days, with 6,000 turning out on 9 and 10 August to watch Warwickshire play Australia.\nEdgbaston's first Test match was the first in The Ashes series against Australia in 1902, for which the club erected a permanent stand, two temporary stands and facilities for 90 members of the press. These developments cost a total of £1,500, however, and Warwickshire's share of the tour funds was only £750.\nPost-war development.\nThe first piece of development in the post-war era was the construction of the Rea Bank and the Thwaite Memorial Scoreboard in 1950. In 1956 an Indoor Cricket School was built and the Pavilion Suite was completed in the same year. By the time the William Ansell Stand opened in 1967 the facilities at Edgbaston were considered to rival those at Lord's.\nIn 1989 executive boxes were added to the rear of the Priory and Raglan Stands and the Stanley Barnes Stand was reconstructed and enlarged, expanding the ground capacity of 17,500.\nIn July 1997, Edgbaston was the scene of the first competitive floodlit day-night cricket match in Britain.\nThe pavilion end on the south side of the ground was completely redeveloped between 2010 and 2011 at a cost of £32 million, partly paid for from a £20 million loan from Birmingham City Council, bringing the ground's capacity up to 25,000. Demolition of the pavilion – parts of which dated back to the 1890s – and the Leslie Deakins, R. V. Ryder and William Ansell Stands took place in January 2010, with construction of the new South and West Stands starting in April 2010 and reaching completion 66 weeks later. 5 permanent floodlight pylons were erected around the ground at the same time, allowing up to 15 days of day-night cricket annually. The new development was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh on 25 July 2011. The first test match to be played at the redeveloped venue was the third Test vs India on 10 August 2011, which saw England reach the number 1 position in the ICC Test Championship for the first time with victory by an innings and 242 runs on the fourth day of the match.\nGround.\nEdgbaston is considered to be one of England's leading cricket grounds. \"Wisden\"'s guide to cricket grounds in 1992 commented that \"Lord's is really its only superior in the United Kingdom\" with \"The Daily Telegraph\" agreeing in 2009 that \"taken all in all, it is now the best ground outside Lord's\". After the opening of the new South and West Stands in 2011 the England and Wales Cricket Board commented that \"the spacious facilities are cutting edge, marginally better than the Home of Cricket\".\nThe atmosphere at Edgbaston is reputed to be the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled \"On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side.\" and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how \"The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment\". After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented \"The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even guys who have played a fair bit of cricket were looking at each other and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us.\"\nThe record attendance at a County Championship match at Edgbaston is 28,000 against Lancashire in the championship-winning season of 1951, and the record for a single day of a test match is 32,000 against the West Indies in 1957.\nFor some years until 2000, Edgbaston had a distinctive motorized rain cover system, known as \"the Brumbrella\".\nNotable moments.\nHighest Innings team score\nLowest innings team score\nHighest individual score\nBest bowling figures\nHighest partnerships\nLeading run-scorers\nLeading wicket-takers"

        "title": "James Creighton (ice hockey)",
        "text": "James George Aylwin Creighton (June 12, 1850 – June 27, 1930) was a Canadian lawyer, engineer, journalist and athlete. He is credited with organizing the first recorded indoor ice hockey match at Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1875. He helped popularize the sport in Montreal and later in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada after he moved to Ottawa in 1882 where he served for 48 years as the law clerk to the Senate of Canada.\nBiography.\nCreighton was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the eldest son of William Hudson Creighton and Anna Fairbanks, grandson of James G. A. Creighton, founder of the James G. A. Creighton and Son ship chandling and wholesale food business. He was educated at Halifax Grammar School, where he graduated at age 14, then earned an arts degree with honours from University of King's College in 1868. He then studied under Sandford Fleming, who as engineer-in-chief for the Intercolonial Railway, hired him to work on surveys in Nova Scotia. Creighton moved to Montreal in 1872 and was employed as an engineer on the Lachine Canal, Montreal Harbour, and other public works. He was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Great Britain in 1876 and then attended McGill University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in common law, graduating with first class honours in 1880. On July 9, 1880, he was called to the Quebec bar, and two years later he became a partner in the firm of Barnard, Beauchamp, Creighton, and Doucet of Montreal.\nFrom 1877 to 1881, Creighton was very involved in journalism, writing for The Montreal Gazette, Scribner's Magazine and various other publications. Creighton served as correspondent for \"The Gazette\" in the press gallery of the House of Commons of Canada. This experience and legal training led to his appointment on March 3, 1882, as law clerk to the Senate of Canada, a position he would hold for 48 years.\nCreighton married Eleanor Platt of Montreal in 1878. Creighton was a member of the Rideau Club in Ottawa and captained their ice hockey team that opened the new Rideau Skating Rink in 1889. It was at the Rideau Club where Creighton suffered a fatal heart attack in 1930. At his funeral, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden was one of the mourners. His wife Eleanor died not long afterwards. Creighton and Platt were interred at Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery. For many years, the grave was left unmarked. The couple had no children, which may be why there was no monument erected on the grave.\nRole in ice hockey development.\nCreighton is considered the \"father of ice hockey,\" although he never claimed that honour. After moving to Montreal from Halifax to study and to work in engineering, Creighton sometimes acted as a figure skating judge at the Victoria Skating Club's Victoria Skating Rink. As a member of the club, he organized early morning sessions of informal hockey at the rink with his friends from McGill University and members of the club. It was here that Creighton captained one of the two teams that participated in the first recorded indoor game of organized ice hockey on March 3, 1875. His nine-man team won two \"games\" (goals) to one over the opposition led by Charles Torrance. According to teammate Henry Joseph, Creighton also organized the game. \"It was this exhibition which aroused city-wide interest and gave rise to the formation of other ice hockey teams and to the rapid development of the game,\" McGill's physical education director Emanuel M. Orlick would write in \"The Gazette\" in 1943. In 1877, Creighton became the captain of the first known organized ice hockey team, the McGill University Hockey Club.\nCreighton had played sports during his boyhood in Halifax, where a free-wheeling, stick-ball game called \"ricket\", \"shinny\" or occasionally \"hockey\", was played on ice outdoors with any number of players. It is believed that Creighton developed rules for the organized indoor game from the style of play of those games in Halifax, where (according to some historians) they had developed out of a Scottish game called shinty. However, ice hockey also has its roots in the aboriginal game of lacrosse, the English game of field hockey, the Irish game of hurling and the northern European game of bandy. Creighton is thought to be the person responsible for publishing the first rules for ice hockey in the February 27, 1877 edition of \"The Gazette\" (although the rules were virtually identical to previously published field hockey rules).\nWhile living and working in Ottawa, Creighton continued his interest in ice hockey and joined with young parliamentarians and government 'aides de camp' to form a team called the Rideau Hall Rebels, after the residence of the Governor General of Canada, in Ottawa. That team played games in and around Ottawa and became well known. Creighton befriended teammates Edward and Arthur Stanley, sons of then Canadian Governor General Lord Stanley, as well as Judge John Augustus Barron (later a forming member of the OHA). In 1892, Lord Stanley presented a trophy – the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, known today as the Stanley Cup – to designate the amateur ice hockey championship of Canada.\nHonours.\nCreighton was appointed CMG in the 1913 Birthday Honours.\nCreighton was inducted into the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame in 1993 as the \"father of organized hockey.\"\nOn May 22, 2008, Creighton was honored with a plaque at Centre Bell in Montreal, Quebec, the home rink of the Montreal Canadiens. The plaque was unveiled by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Centre Bell is located near the site of the old Victoria Skating Rink.\nThe Society for International Hockey Research mounted a public campaign during 2008 and 2009 to erect a monument on Creighton's grave site. Contributors included members of the Society, Beechwood Cemetery, and the public. Notable donors included the crew of , Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk and Calgary Flames owner Harley Hotchkiss. A gravestone and biographical plaque were unveiled at the cemetery in a ceremony on October 24, 2009. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper was in attendance.\nIn 2015, Creighton was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nExternal links.\nhttps://birthplaceofhockey.com/hockey-history/hockeyists/mikmaq-story-tellers/"

        "title": "UAAP basketball championships",
        "text": "The UAAP basketball championships are basketball tournaments held from September to December by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, and the men's tournament is the flagship tournament of the UAAP. Basketball is a mandatory sport for all schools. All eight universities participate in the men's, women's, and high school (boys') tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe tournament is divided into two divisions, the collegiate' division, which is further subdivided into the men's tournament, for male collegiate players, and the women's tournament for female collegiate players. The other division is the high school division which is also subdivided into two tournaments for the male and female high school athletes.\nThe UAAP basketball sport has a rich history of schools establishing dynasties. UE won a record seven consecutive basketball titles from 1965 to 1971 albeit the third one was a shared championship with UST. Ateneo had a 5-year winning streak from 2008 to 2012. Two other schools ended their championship streak at four. UST won it from 1993 to 1996 and La Salle from 1998 to 2001.\nThe championship in basketball is the most coveted title that schools aspire for during a UAAP season and is one of the most anticipated live TV sporting events in the Philippines, but such aspirations have resulted in many controversies in the association. There are protests filed by the member-schools against one another almost every season. Ironically, the association has a handbook of its rules and regulations.\nTournament format.\nPre-first expansion format.\nBefore the UAAP's first expansion, teams would play a single round robin where the team with the best record would be crowned champions. If two or more teams are tied, they would be declared co-champions. No quotient system or knockout games were used to break ties.\nFirst expansion format.\nTeams play a double round robin. The winner of the first round play the winner of the second round in a 1-game championship to determine the champion. Ties for round winners are broken by knockout games.\nIf a team wins both rounds, it is automatically declared the champion, regardless if it was a sweep or not. If a team fails to win either rounds, but ends up with a better over-all record than either of the round winners, that team will challenge the second round winner for a championship slot against the first round winner.\nSecond and third expansion format.\nTeams play a double round robin. The top two teams (over-all record) after the double round robin play in the Finals with the No. 1 seed holding a twice-to-beat advantage. If a team sweeps the double round robin, they are automatically declared champions.\nFinal four format.\nThe tournament currently uses the Final Four format, first implemented in 1993. The Tournament begins with a double round-robin elimination, where a team plays the other teams twice to determine which teams will qualify for the semi-finals (also called Final Four). The top four finishers enter the Final Four phase.\nSweeper's advantage.\nPreviously, if a team sweeps the double round robin, they are automatically declared champions. However, after UST's sweep in 1993, it was modified so that the sweeping team would automatically qualify for the best-of-three Finals. After UE swept their way to the Finals in 2007, it was again modified so that the sweeping team would now automatically qualify for a best-of-five Finals, holding a 1–0 game advantage.\nRegular final four.\nIf no team sweeps the double round eliminations, the four top teams (and tiebreakers, if applicable) qualify for the regular postseason.\nThe regular post-season is divided into the semi-finals (also called Final Four) and the Finals. In the semi-Finals, the two top seeds (Nos. 1 &amp; 2) have a twice-to-beat advantage against the lower seeds (Nos. 3 &amp; 4).\nThe surviving teams face off in a best-of-three finals, where the team which notches two wins first wins the championship.\nStep ladder final four.\nFrom 2008 to 2015, if a team wins all of the games in the group stage, the step ladder format is used, where the unbeaten team has a bye up to the best-of-5 finals holding a 1–0 game advantage. The third and fourth seed will figure in a knockout game; the winner of that game will face the second seed with a twice-to-win disadvantage. The surviving team meets the first seed at the Finals. The format was modified in 2016, where the unbeaten team proceeds to the best-of-3 finals without any playoff advantage, but the knockout games in all of the three semifinal seeds remain in place.\nList of basketball champions.\nEarly years.\nThe foundation of the UAAP by FEU, NU, UP and UST in 1938.\nFirst expansion.\nAdamson University, Manila Central University, University of Manila and University of the East were admitted in 1952 on a two-year probationary membership status. Only UE and MCU retained as permanent member. However, MCU pulled-out in 1962. Adamson was readmitted into the association in 1970.\nSecond expansion.\nAteneo was accepted as a member in 1978.\nThird expansion.\nLa Salle was accepted as a member in 1986.\nFinal Four era.\nIntroduction of the Final Four format.\nInclusivity era.\nIn line with the association's commitment for inclusiveness, the tournament for girls' division was introduced.\nNumber of championships by school.\nChampionships won when a tournament was a demonstration sport are not included.\nStatistics.\nThe first ever sweep in UAAP basketball history was recorded by the FEU Tamaraws in 1980. \nChampionship streaks.\nNotes\nFinal Four records.\n^ Does not include 2 seasons (2013–14 and 2015–16) where NU swept the group stage and automatically advanced to the Finals.\nMost Valuable Players.\nNotes:\nFinals MVP.\nNotes:\nRookie of the Year.\nPrior to 2005, all players playing in their first year (including transfers and those elevated from \"team B\") are eligible for the award. \nIn Season 68, the rule covering the collegiate division was changed. Only fresh high school graduates are eligible. The exception was in UAAP Season 85 when those enrolled in 2021, along with those enrolled in 2022 or fresh high school graduates, are eligible for the award at the collegiate level. Similarly, in the same season, adjustments were also implemented in the high school division where only those aged 17 and below will be eligible for the same award. \nNotes:\nChampionships by coach.\nListed below are the coaches who won at least one UAAP seniors championships. The list is incomplete."

        "text": "Jermaine Edward Lewis (born October 16, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected in the fifth round (153rd overall) of the 1996 NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens, who he played for until 2001. With the Ravens, he won Super Bowl XXXV over the New York Giants. He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins.\nIn his career Lewis also played for the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars.\nEarly years.\nLewis attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School, where he was a two-time team MVP as a running back, while also as a sprinter on the track team, setting a national high school record in the 200 meters in 1992.\nCollege career.\nLewis was a four-year starter at Maryland, where he set several ACC records, including a record 193 receptions.\nTrack and field.\nLewis was also a track star at Maryland, where he competed in the 100 meters and 200 meters, posting personal bests of 10.33 seconds and 20.82 seconds, respectively.\nProfessional career.\nLewis was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round (153rd overall) of the 1996 NFL draft. As a rookie, he established himself as the team's kick and punt returner, as well as their slot receiver.\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Lewis scored 23 touchdowns (a franchise record passed by Jamal Lewis in 2003) and made the Pro Bowl in 1998 and 2001 as a returner. He led the NFL in punt return average in 1997 with 15.6 yards-per-return, punt return yards in 2001 with 519, and punt return touchdowns in 1998 and 2000 with two. In the Ravens 34–7 win over the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV, he had 152 all-purpose yards (111 kickoff return yards, 34 punt return yards, seven receiving yards, one rushing yard), including an 84-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second half that put the game out of reach.\nIn the 2002 expansion draft, Lewis was selected sixth by the Houston Texans, carrying a salary cap figure of US$4.29 million. However, he was released by the Texans after just one season. He then played for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2003 and 2004 before being allocated to NFL Europe.\nLewis finished his nine NFL seasons with 148 rushing yards, 143 receptions for 2,129 yards, 295 punt returns for 3,282 yards, and 4,611 yards on kickoff returns. Overall, he recorded 10,170 total all-purpose yards and scored 23 touchdowns (17 receiving, six punt returns). With the Ravens, he gained 8,001 all-purpose yards, which stood as a franchise record until surpassed by Jamal Lewis in 2006. His 3,282 punt return yards ranked him 7th on the NFL all-time list.\nPersonal life.\nLewis has three sons. He also had a child named Geronimo, who was stillborn in 2000. Lewis has a charity in honor of Geronimo called the Geronimo Lewis Foundation.\nOn August 15, 2011, Lewis was arrested and charged with resisting arrest by the Baltimore County Police Department. The arrest occurred after a hit and run car accident. Lewis was arrested again on February 16, 2012."

        "title": "Baseball in Australia",
        "text": "In Australia, baseball is a game that is played in all states and territories of the country.\nHistory.\nBaseball was believed to have been brought to Australia with American gold miners in the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s, where miners would play baseball on the gold fields on their rest days. The first reports of organised teams and results appeared in Ballarat, Victoria in .\nIn 1867, Victorian cricketers William Gaggin and Louis Goldsmith tried to set up a game of baseball at Yarra Park but were disrupted by fans arriving for a local Australian football match. The first competitive series was played between the Surry Baseball Club and members of the New South Wales Cricket Association over June/July 1878. However, it is argued competitive organised one-off matches from as early as 1875 were played before this time.\nIn December 1888, American entrepreneur Albert Spalding brought his Chicago White Stockings and a team of U.S. all-stars to Australia, as part of a world tour. Sydney Cricket Ground hosted three games. After the tour left Australia, Spalding's aide Harry Simpson helped organize baseball leagues in Victoria (1890) and New South Wales (1891); he was inducted into the Baseball Australia Hall of Fame in its inaugural class of 2005.\nThe first interstate baseball games were played in 1890 when Victoria played South Australia at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. The visitors won the best of three series 16–14, 27–18 and 22–26 in Melbourne. These two states in 1897 formed the first Australia representative baseball team which toured the United States on what became known as the Kangaroo Tour.\nThe Australian team sponsored by Mr A.J. Roberts with £1,500 was selected to tour the United States. They were outclassed by the home teams, winning only eight of their first 26 games. The Americans were surprised to note the Australian outfielders did not wear gloves. Many of the tourists relied on friends and relatives to get them home as the organisers ran out of credit to send them back home.\nThose players on the team who could afford it continued on to tour England. Games were billed as Australia vs England and were played at the Crystal Palace Sports Ground, although the tour turned sour when the team manager left London with the gate receipts, leaving many more players in financial limbo. This set the game back several years in Victoria and South Australia; however, it continued to flourish in New South Wales where the sport was established as a winter sport through the New South Wales Winter League in 1898.\nThe first Australian championships were in 1910 in Hobart, Tasmania between New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and won by NSW. This was followed by a similar series in Melbourne, Victoria between Victoria, NSW, South Australia and Tasmania in August 1910. NSW also won this series.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Americans also tried to set up baseball leagues and competitions in Australia, with some success. A national league was initiated in 1934, and the national team entered World Championship competition in the late 1970s. Prior to winning the silver medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Australia had finished 7th in the Olympics twice, which is also the highest position reached in World Championships.\nIn the late 1980s to late 1990s the national league took off, with most capital cities having a team. The games were broadcast weekly on ABC television around the country. In the 12 months to March 1995 baseball hit its peak attendance rates with 133,000 people, equivalent to 0.9% of Australians over 15, having attended a baseball game that year. This was just under the attendance of golf and above outdoor hockey and lawn bowls.\nA national-level competition still exists, as well as lower-level club competitions, but the game attracts comparatively little or no spectator or media interest. Several Australians, however, have attracted the attention of American scouts and have gone on to play in the major leagues in the United States and Japan.\nAlthough baseball remains a fringe sport at adult level, it has experienced explosive growth at the youth level in the 21st century. The first Little League Baseball-affiliated league in the country was established in 2007. By mid-2012, the number of Little Leagues in the country had risen to about 400, making Australia the largest country in Little League participation outside of North America. This growth led the parent organisation to announce that Australia would receive an automatic berth in the Little League World Series starting in 2013.\nBaseball Associations and Leagues.\nBaseball Australia\nBaseball Victoria\nBaseball NSW\nBaseball Queensland\nBaseball SA\nCanberra Baseball\nBaseball NT\nBaseball TAS\nBaseball WA\nSummer vs Winter.\nBaseball is considered traditionally a summer sport, meaning such that it will start in spring and end in autumn, however, this has changed many times in Australia for different reasons. One of these reasons is because baseball in Australia was originally considered a sport for cricketers in the off-season, but as baseball became more popular as a standalone sport it was played more often in summer. The Claxton Shield was traditionally played in the Australian winter so Sheffield Shield players could participate.\nHowever, the Australian Baseball League, International Baseball League of Australia and Claxton Shield in recent years have been played in the Australian summer, this is due to the MLB and other northern hemisphere baseball leagues being played in the northern summer, therefore many high-profile players from Australia were unable to play in the southern winter.\nBoth summer and winter baseball was played in Melbourne in the 1920s and Sydney from until the end of World War II, when baseball across Australia became mainly winter only. The exception to this was summer night baseball at Norwood Oval in Adelaide, South Australia in the 1950s and at Oriole Stadium in Sydney from . During the late 1960s the trend swung back towards baseball's traditional season of summer.\nWhen the New South Wales Major League decided to play summer only day baseball in 1973, a breakaway Sydney Winter League formed to continue playing in winter, while most NSW country centres continued in the winter. The Victorian Baseball Association in Melbourne switched to summer only in mid-1970. Since 1974 Sydney Baseball is now indeed an all year round sport.\nNotable players.\nThere are many Australians playing baseball professionally in the United States, Japan, Korea, and various other countries.\nAs of December 2021 there was one Australian player playing in MLB:\nGraeme Lloyd was the first Australian World Series Champion winning with both the 1996 and 1998 Yankees, he is one of Six Australians to play post-season MLB Games (as at December 2021):\nSecondary school level.\nAustralian Schools Championships.\nThe Australian Schools Championships for baseball, also informally named at all levels 'schoolboys', is an annual secondary school tournament that has been officially running since 1989. It includes an Open and U-15 tournament. Currently New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT compete in the Championship.\nTeams are picked by their state's school sport association from their respective schoolboys state titles. It also provides an opportunity for the Australia national schoolboy baseball team to be picked.\nThe eventual tournament winner was Queensland, defeating New South Wales 3–1 in the final.\nWestern Australia won the event defeating New South Wales 5–0 in the final."

One of their most memorable moments was Cipollini's 4 consecutive stage wins in the 1999 Tour de France. The image of Mario Cipollini approaching the TV camera right after a win to say, \"Cannondale makes the best bikes!\" propelled Cannondale's popularity among road racers.\nThe Saeco team is known for their pranks and antics. Cipollini's antics are legendary, including showing up to the stage start at the Tour de France dressed in a Julius Caesar-inspired toga complete with an olive wreath, riding on a carriage pulled by his teammates on bicycles. More recently, the entire Saeco team raced a stage of the 2003 Tour de France wearing a \"Legalize my Cannondale\" chaingang cycling kit to protest the UCI's lower bound on bike weight which means that their six13 prototype team bikes were underweight and required the installation of additional weight.\nMajor wins.\nStage 18 Tour de France, Salvatore Commesso"

        "title": "1923 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1923 Tour de France was the 17th edition of the Tour de France, taking place 24 June to 22 July. It consisted of 15 stages over 5386 km, ridden at an average speed of 24.233 km/h. The race was won by Henri Pélissier with a convincing half-hour lead to his next opponent, Italian Ottavio Bottecchia. In total, 139 cyclists entered the race, of which 48 finished. Pélissier's victory was the first French victory since 1911, as the Tour de France had been dominated by Belgian cyclists since then.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had quit the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire. This had caused a fight between the Pélissier brothers and tour organiser Henri Desgrange, and because of this fight, the Pélissier brother had been absent in the 1921 and 1922 Tours de France. In 1921, Henri Desgrange wrote in his newspaper: \"Pélissier doesn't know how to suffer. He will never win the Tour\" Still, Henri Pélissier was the most talented French racer of his period, and in 1923 had won every major race except the Tour de France. The Tour de France had been dominated by Belgian cyclists in the last years, which was not good for the popularity of the race in France. The organiser knew that Pélissier in the race would increase the interest in the race, but did not want to apologise to Pélissier. Therefore, Desgrange wrote in l'Auto that Henri Pélissier was too old to win the Tour de France, and that Pélissier would therefore probably never start in the Tour de France. This was the reason for Pélissier to enter the race the same day.\nIn the 1922 Tour de France, Hector Heusghem had lost the race because he received a one-hour penalty for illegally changing his bicycle. The rules about reparations were changed in the 1923 Tour: technical assistance from team directors was allowed. It was still not allowed to change equipment with other cyclists.\nAnother introduction was the time bonus for stage winners. After each stage, the overall time of the stage winner was reduced with two minutes.\nParticipants.\nIn previous years, the cyclists had been divided in two classes, the sponsored class and the unsponsored class. In 1923, this system changed, and three categories were used: the \"first category\", of the top cyclist, the \"second category\", of lesser but still sponsored cyclists, and the \"touriste-routiers\", the quasi-amateurs.\nThe sponsors, who had joined forces in the previous tours under the name La Sportive, were now financially stable enough to have their own teams. Automoto, sponsor of the team with the Pélissier brothers, had commercial interests in Italy, so wanted to have Italian cyclists in the team. Several Italian cyclists were hired, who were supposed to come to France. Only one Italian cyclist showed up, Ottavio Bottecchia, who had started as a professional the year before. The sponsor then decided that the marketing plan would not work with only one Italian cyclist, and wanted to send him back. At the last minute, Bottecchia was allowed to stay on the team.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by Robert Jacquinot, who had also won the first stage of the 1922 Tour de France.\nIn the second stage, Ottavio Bottecchia, at that moment a little-known Italian cyclist, won the sprint. Bottecchia had finished in second place in the first stage, and now took over the lead. He was the first Italian cyclist to wear the yellow jersey.\nIn the third stage, the Pélissier brothers showed their dominance. The race was won by Henri, with Francis in second place. Bottecchia had a flat tire after 300 km in the race and lost some minutes, but he fought back and only lost 37 second on the finish line.\nIn the fourth stage, Henri Pélissier received a two-minute penalty, for throwing away a tyre. Bottecchia punctured again and lost the lead to Romain Bellenger.\nIn the Pyrenees, French Jean Alavoine was the dominant cyclist, as he won three stages. In the sixth stage, Robert Jacquinot, who was primarily known as a sprinter, rode away and topped the first three mountains first. He seemed to go on and win the stage and took over the lead, but the last mountain was too much for Jacquinot, and he fell off his bike climbing the Peyresourde. Alavoine passed Jacquinot and went on to win the stage, while Bottecchia won back enough time to regain his lead from Bellenger, who lost a lot of time. When Alavoine won his third stage in Nice, Bottecchia was leading the race, with Alavoine in second place and Henri Pélissier in third place, almost half an hour behind.\nIn the tenth stage, the high alps were climbed. Francis Pélissier was riding with an injured knee, but together with Lucien Buysse, he was planning to help Henri Pélissier take over the lead from their teammate Bottecchia. Although the race was neutralized on the Vars, Henri Pélissier still won the stage with a large margin to Alavoine and Bottecchia, and took over the lead. The experience of Pélissier helped him: Bottecchia was riding in too big a gear, which Pélissier saw. In order to change gears, Bottecchia would have had to dismount his bicycle, so Pélissier sped away, and Bottecchia could not follow. In the eleventh stage, the Pélissier brothers left all other cyclists behind, with only Bellenger staying within ten minutes. Alavoine had to abandon the race after an accident, which put Bottecchia in second place. At that point, all the stages left were flat stages where it is difficult to win much time, and with an almost 30 minutes lead over his teammate Bottecchia, Pélissier was assured of the victory.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time (after compensating for time bonuses and/or time penalties) was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nFor his overall victory, Henri Pélissier received 10000 francs. In total, Henri Pélissier won 17638 francs in the 1923 Tour de France, almost ninety times the standard monthly wage at that time.\nAftermath.\nHenri Pélissier was the first French winner of the Tour de France since 1911, and ended a series of seven Belgian victories. Desgrange, who had been in a fight with Pélissier for three years, wrote \"The mountains seemed to sink lower, sunk by the victorious thrust of his muscle. More than a score of times on the most vicious gradients, hands on the tops of the bars, he looked down at the valley bottoms, like an eagle staring at his prey\". The French victory was good for the organising newspaper l'Auto: the circulation increased to almost half a million copies, while it peaked at one million the morning after Pélissier's victory.\nAt the end of the race, the winner Henri Pélissier declared that Bottecchia would be the winner of the next Tour. This prediction was right; Bottecchia won the 1924 and the 1925 Tour de France.\nThe introduction of time bonuses for stage winners was considered a success and has been used for many Tours after 1923, although the details have changed since."

        "title": "1934 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1934 Tour de France was the 28th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 3 to 29 July. It consisted of 23 stages over . The race was won by Antonin Magne, who had previously won the 1931 Tour de France. The French team was dominant, holding the yellow jersey for the entire race and winning most of the stages. Every member of the French team won at least one stage.\nFrench cyclist René Vietto rose to prominence by winning the mountains classification, but even more by giving up his own chances for the Tour victory by giving first his front wheel and later his bicycle to his team captain Magne.\nThe 1934 Tour de France saw the introduction of the split stage and the individual time trial. Stage 21 was split into two parts, and the second part was an individual time trial, the first one in the history of the Tour de France.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe major introduction in 1934 was the introduction of the individual time trial (ITT). There had been time-trial like stages before in the Tour de France, but they had been run as a team time trial. Since the format of the Tour de France changed in 1930 from trade teams to national teams, the Tour organisation had to pay for the housing, travel and feeding for the cyclists. The organisation received the money from the sales of l'Auto, the newspaper that organised the Tour. l'Auto was a morning newspaper, while one of its competitors, Paris-Soir, was an evening paper. Paris-Soir was also following the race, and was able to publish the results the same day, while l'Auto had to wait for the next day, publishing old news. To counter this, the stages in the Tour de France had started later, so they would end after Paris-Soir had to print their newspapers.\nThe Paris-Soir sports editor had countered this by starting his own race, the Grand Prix des Nations, run as an ITT. The first edition in 1932 was not received well by the cyclists, but from 1933 on it was a success. The tour director Henri Desgrange saw the success of the French cyclists in the Grand Prix des Nations, and adapted the individual time trial format in the Tour.\nNot all cyclists were happy with the ITT. René Vietto, a climber, said it was a dull test of horsepower, while a bike race should also test the head. Other cyclists said the ITT would negate the effect of good teamwork.\nThe bonification system from the 1933 Tour de France was slightly reduced: now the winner of a stage received 90 seconds bonification, and the second cyclist 45 seconds. In addition to this, the winner of the stage received a bonification equal to the difference between him and the second-placed cyclists, with a maximum of two minutes. This same bonification system was applied on mountain summits that counted for the mountains classification.\nIn 1933, there had been 40 touriste-routiers, cyclist not competing in a national team, but in 1934 this was reduced to 20. In previous years, these touriste-routiers had to supply their own material and arrange their own hotels; in 1934, the conditions improved and touriste-routiers were given the same treatment as the riders in national teams.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1934 Tour de France was contested by national teams. Belgium, Italy, Germany and France each sent teams of 8 cyclists each, while Switzerland and Spain sent a combined team of eight cyclists. In addition, there were 20 individual cyclists; other than in 1933, they were no longer racing under the nomer \"touriste-routier\" but as \"individuel\". In total this made 60 cyclists.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe French team of 1934 consisted of all good riders, with the core of the team being the winner of 1933, Georges Speicher, Roger Lapébie, former winner Antonin Magne and Maurice Archambaud, who had performed well in 1933. The French selectors were criticized for selecting René Vietto, a twenty-year-old rider who had only won some small races. The Italian team now included Giuseppe Martano, who had ridden as a touriste-routier in 1933. The Belgian team, which normally included some big contenders, was lackluster.\nRoute and stages.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 7.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by 1933 winner Speicher, and again wore the yellow jersey. In the second stage, he lost his lead as there was a split, with Speicher in the second part and Magne in the leading group, and Magne took over the leading position.\nIn the fifth stage, Le Grevès and Speicher finished close together. After examining the photo finish, both cyclists shared the time bonus, although Le Grevès was named winner.\nAfter stage six, before the heavy climbing in the alps, Magne was leading with almost 8 minutes on second-placed Martano. In the alps, Vietto was the best. He won stages 7 and 9, and climbed to third place in the general classification, half an hour behind Magne. Had he not lost 40 minutes in the first two stages due to flat tires, he would have been the leader of the race. Martano had been able to reduce the margin to Magne to 125 seconds.\nThe stages 12 to 14, between the Alps and the Pyrenees, were won by French cyclists, without important changes in the general classification. In the fifteenth stage, Magne attacked on an early climb, but Martano did not drop. The big climb of the day was the Puymorens, and Vietto lead while Magne and Martano followed. On the way down, Magne crashed on a pothole, and broke the wooden rim of his front wheel. Martano saw his chances, and raced away. Magne asked Vietto for his bicycle, but Vietto only gave him his front wheel. Magne's frame had been bent in the crash, so when Speicher, the next French cyclist, showed up, Magne took Speicher's bicycle. Vietto had to wait several minutes to get a replacing front wheel, and lost all chances for the stage victory. A photographer was present to take a picture of Vietto, weeping with a bike without a front wheel. When this picture was published, the cycling world was touched, and newspapers proclaimed him \"Le Roi René\" (King René).\nIn the sixteenth stage, things got worse for Vietto. He was first over the first two mountains, with his team leader Magne and Martano closely following. On the descent of the Portet d'Aspet, Magne crashed again, and broke his rear wheel. Vietto was unaware of this, and continued. When he was down, a Tour course marshall informed him that his team leader had crashed. Lapébie was far ahead, and all the other French cyclists were far behind, so Magne was without support. Vietto then turned around, and rode back up the mountain. When he reached Magne, Magne took Vietto's bicycle. Magne rode down, reached Lapébie who had waited for him, and together they caught Martano. Vietto had to wait for the service car to bring him a new bicycle, and finally finished four minutes behind Magne, Martano and Lapébie.\nVietto was not happy with what had happened, and he said that Magne did not know how to ride, and that Lapébie should not have been so far ahead. Magne on the other hand was grateful for what Vietto and Lapébie did.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Magne was able to get away from Martano who broke his frame, and finished 13 minutes ahead of thim while winning the stage. Magne now lead with almost 20 minutes.\nIn the eighteenth stage, Magne lost four minutes to Martano. It could have been more, had not Vietto and Lapébie collected the time bonuses on the mountains and the finish.\nIn the next flat stages, nothing really changed the general classification except the individual time trial in stage 21. Magne won there, increasing the margin to Martano by 8 minutes. Vietto had won back enough time to end in fifth place in the general classification, and won the mountains classification. Magne had ridden consistently in the entire Tour, and had benefitted from his team support. He won his second Tour de France, the fifth in a row for France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nFor the mountains classification, 14 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. On the top of these mountains, ten points were given for the first cyclist to pass, nine points to the second cyclist, and so on, until the tenth cyclist who got one point.\nFor the fifth time, there was a team competition, this time won by the French team. The team classification was calculated in 1934 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. The fifth national team that started, the Belgian team, finished with only two cyclists, so according to the rules in 1934 they were no longer eligible for the team classification.\nFourth-placed Félicien Vervaecke became the winner of the \"individuals\" category. This classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only the cyclists riding as individuals were eligible.\nAftermath.\nThe individual time trial that was introduced in 1934 was a success, and has been used since then in almost every year.\nRené Vietto, who had sacrificed his Tour chances for his team leader Magne, was convinced that he could have won the Tour instead."

The earliest known match involving a team from Dartford took place in 1722, against London, but the club's own website says it was formally established in 1727. The club is still in existence and now plays in the Kent Cricket League.\nHistory.\nDartford players were reckoned by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, writing in his diary in 1723, to \"lay claim to the greatest excellence\" among English cricketers. The club played a number of big matches against London and, in 1756, they were involved in a tri-series against the sport's rising power, the Hambledon Club.\nDartford produced several famous players in the 18th century including cricket's earliest known great player William Bedle. Later players included William Hodsoll, John Bell, John Frame and Ned Wenman.\nThe club originally used Dartford Brent, an area of common land, as its ground. By the end of the 18th century it had moved to Bowman's Lodge on Dartford Heath before its current ground at Hesketh Park was established in 1905. In 2002 the club merged with Dartford Halls Cricket Club, retaining the name Dartford Cricket Club for its First XI."

He had a long tenure calling television broadcasts for the New York Mets on the MSG Network and Fox Sports Net New York.\nPlaying career.\nIn his baseball career, Healy played for the Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees, accumulating a .250 career batting average. The highlight of his time with the Royals came in 1973 and 1974, when Healy caught Steve Busby's two career no-hitters, against the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers respectively. Healy had a close relationship with Reggie Jackson while on the Yankees, where he served as a mediator between the fiery slugger and Yankee manager Billy Martin as well as teammate, captain Thurman Munson.\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter his playing career ended in 1978, he worked on radio broadcasts for the Yankees until 1981. In 1979, he added the Yankees' cable television broadcasts on SportsChannel (which became Fox Sports Net New York) to the resume, staying with the cable crew until the end of the 1983 season.\nHealy worked on Mets telecasts from 1984 to 2005, also working as the host of \"Mets Inside Pitch\" and \"Halls of Fame\", a series that profiled careers of famous athletes (and originally taking its name from the cough drop company that shared the name). In 1987, Healy interviewed former President Richard Nixon during one of his post-game shows, discussing a range of baseball issues of the day. He is one of three sportscasters who was a regular announcer for both the Yankees and the Mets; the others are Tom Seaver and Tim McCarver.\nWhen Keith Hernandez was added to Mets telecasts, Healy and Hernandez's game-calling often became humorous, pointing to a sometimes-contentious relationship between the two. Healy was not signed to be part of the Mets' new cable channel, SportsNet New York, for 2006. Healy is the current host of \"The Game 365\" on MSG Network, in New York City.

The film chronicles a summer in the life of Frankie, a teenager on South Carolina's Myrtle Beach.\nThe film premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival in January 2000 and went on to play a variety of film festivals, including the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and the Chicago International Film Festival. At Outfest Los Angeles, Ambrose won the award for Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film.\nPlot.\nOn Myrtle Beach, Frankie works at her family's burger stand run by her older brother Neil. During her off hours, she hangs out with her best friend Nicola, who runs a nearby piercing stand. The dynamic between the girls shifts when her brother hires a new girl named Josee to work at the restaurant. Though Josee is thought to be dating the local lifeguard, she expresses interest in Frankie. Frankie also meets a quirky drifter, Heath, while Nicola gets to know Kalani, a Marine from Hawaii. As Frankie starts to spend more time with Josee, Nicola tells Frankie the upsetting news that Josee is cheating with Neil, who is married and has a young family.\nProduction.\nLauren Ambrose was cast well before the HBO series \"Six Feet Under\" took off in critical acclaim.\nDirector Robert J. Siegel said, \"The best part about making this movie was that we were under no obligation whatsoever to anyone. This movie is what I call fiercely independent. It's got a very European feel to it - Eric Rohmer was one of my muses when making it.\"\nPrincipal photography took place over 28 days from October to November 1998.\nRelease.\nThe film debuted at the 2000 Slamdance Film Festival. In November 2000, the film secured a distribution deal and was given a limited release on April 5, 2002.\nCritical reception.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised the film, writing Ambrose is \"an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearning.\" He added, \"\"Swimming\" could unfold as a sitcom, or as a desperately sincere drama, but director Robert J. Siegel and his co-writers, Liza Bazadona and Grace Woodard, go for something more delicate and subtle. They use Ambrose's ability to watch and think and not commit, and they allow the summer's choices and possibilities to unfold within her as if her sexuality is awakening for the first time.\" Ed Gonzales of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote the film \"is that rare coming-of-age tale that doesn’t scream \"Afterschool Special\".\"\nOn review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Swimming\" has a 74% approval rating based on 39 reviews. The critics consensus reads, \"A refreshingly low-key coming-of-age story.\""

        "title": "Paul Owens (baseball)",
        "text": "Paul Francis Owens (February 7, 1924 – December 26, 2003), nicknamed \"the Pope\", was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) front office executive, manager, and scout. Earlier, during his playing career, Owens was a first baseman and catcher, and then a manager, in minor league baseball.\nOwens' entire Major League career was spent with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was the general manager and principal architect of the 1980 Phillies, who won the third National League (NL) pennant and became the first World Series champion in franchise history — breaking a 97-year streak of futility dating to the team's founding in . Owens was general manager of the Phillies from June 3, , through the end of , and twice (1972; 1983–1984) added the title of field manager to his job description.\nIn , he took the managerial reins of the Phillies in mid-season and led them to their fourth pennant, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the 1983 World Series. After his tenure as manager ended the following year, he remained with the team as an advisor and scout for the rest of his life.\nBackground.\nNicknamed \"the Pope\" because of his resemblance to Pope Paul VI, Owens was born in Salamanca, New York, and attended St. Bonaventure University. He served in the United States Army as a sergeant during World War II. Prior to 1951, Owens spent several years in the semiprofessional ranks with the Salamanca Merchants in what was then the Suburban League, the local Town Team Baseball circuit.\nOwens and his wife, Marcelle, had two children.\nPlaying career.\nOwens' professional playing career began in 1951 at the relatively advanced age of 27. He played exclusively at the lower ends of the minor leagues, with his active career largely centered in his native western New York. A first baseman who batted and threw right-handed, he twice (1951 and 1957) batted .407 with the Olean Oilers of the Class D PONY League (later called the \"New York–Penn League\") and set a league record by hitting safely in 38 consecutive games in 1951. During his relatively brief playing career, Owens compiled a lifetime average of .374.\nManagerial and front office career.\nIn 1955, Owens was named Olean's playing manager; the following year, the Oilers became a Phillies' affiliate and Owens moved into their organization. In 1958 and 1959, he managed Class C Bakersfield of the California League. In 1960 he became a scout, and, in , director of the entire Philadelphia farm system. On June 3, 1972, he replaced John Quinn as the Phillies' general manager. Then, five weeks later, on July 10, Owens fired manager Frank Lucchesi and assumed that job as well, to get a closer (if temporary) look at the last-place Phillies' on-field struggles. He guided the Phillies to a 33–47 record for the remainder of the 1972 campaign.\nAfter relinquishing managerial duties to Danny Ozark on November 7, 1972, he then returned to the front office and proceeded to turn the Phils into pennant contenders within three seasons. His farm system, one of the most productive in the game at the time, bore fruit—yielding players such as Mike Schmidt, Greg Luzinski, Bob Boone, Larry Bowa and Dick Ruthven. In addition, Owens aggressively swung trades to add missing pieces such as relief pitcher Tug McGraw and outfielders Garry Maddox and Bake McBride. The Phils won the NL East in ––—each time falling short in the National League Championship Series.\nOwens thought he added the final piece in when he signed free agent Pete Rose, but the Phils stumbled and finished fourth. In 1980, under manager Dallas Green, the Phillies beat Houston in an intense NLCS and then defeated the Kansas City Royals for the team's first world championship.\nOwens assumed the managerial role for a second time on July 18, 1983 after firing Pat Corrales despite the Phillies having a 43–42 record and being tied for first place with the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League East. The Owens-led ballclub went from one game over .500 to 47 wins in its last 77 matches to clinch the division title. They then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games in the NLCS to win the Phillies' fourth pennant. During the World Series, the Phils lost to Baltimore in five games.\nOwens returned to managing in , but the results were disappointing. The Phillies played only .500 ball and finished fourth, 15½ games behind the division champ Chicago Cubs.\nOwens was relieved of both his GM and managing jobs during the off-season, but remained with the Phillies as a senior advisor and special scout until his death on December 26, 2003, aged 79, at a hospital in Woodbury, New Jersey. For the 2004 season, the Phillies wore a patch on their right shoulder featuring a banner reading \"Pope\" in honor of Owens, and a shamrock in honor of former relief pitcher McGraw, who had also died that winter. His career managing record was 161–158 (.505)."

He has 16 years experience as a head coach, including stints at the University of California, Berkeley (1972–1977), the University of Illinois (1980–1987) and the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) (1995–1996).\nCollege coaching career.\nDuring his college coaching career, White was twice named National Coach of the Year, first in 1975 at California. He coached a team led by Joe Roth, Chuck Muncie and Wesley Walker to the Pac-8 co-championship—the school's first conference title in 18 years.\nWhite moved to the University of Illinois in 1980. He succeeded Gary Moeller, who in three seasons at Illinois finished no higher than eighth in the Big Ten Conference. White quickly turned around the Illinois football program, posting a winning season in only his second year. In 1982, he led the Illini to the Liberty Bowl, the school's first bowl appearance since the 1964 Rose Bowl. The 1982 Liberty Bowl was also notable as the final game coached by University of Alabama head coach Bear Bryant. In 1983, Illinois won its first Big Ten title in 20 years with an overall record of 10–1, including a 9–0 conference record, and played in the 1984 Rose Bowl. It also marked the first time since 1967 that neither Michigan nor Ohio State won at least a share of the conference title. White was honored for his team's achievements by being named UPI Coach of the Year. The 1983 Illinois team is the only team in Big Ten history to beat each of the other conference teams in a single season, an achievement made possible by the fact that rarely in conference history have teams played all the other teams in a season. White also led the Fighting Illini to the 1985 Peach Bowl, which they lost to Army 31–29. In eight seasons at Illinois, White's teams had a combined record of 47–41–3, for a winning percentage of .533. Along the way, White coached future NFL quarterbacks Dave Wilson, Tony Eason, and Jack Trudeau, and record-setting wide receiver David Williams. White resigned as Illinois coach after the 1987 season due to recruiting violations.\nNFL coaching career.\nWhite's years as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders are best recalled for the team's collapse in the 1995 season, the team's first in Oakland after a 12-year sojourn in Los Angeles, when the 8–2 Raiders went into a nosedive, losing their final six games to finish 8–8 and not make the playoffs. Following a 7–9 record in 1996, White was fired by the Raiders on Christmas Eve, being given the news by Bruce Allen though Al Davis was involved in the decision. White was on the coaching staff of the Rams from 1997-1999, including a Super Bowl victory at the conclusion of the '99 season. White later served as the Director of Football Administration for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nPersonal and later life.\nWhite is a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity.\nWhite is a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Ronnie Lott and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year."

        "title": "Intellivision World Series Baseball",
        "text": "Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball video game (1983) designed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, and published by Mattel for the Intellivision Entertainment Computer System. \"IWSB\" was one of the first sports video games to use multiple camera angles and present a three-dimensional (as opposed to two-dimensional) perspective. It was also the first statistics-based baseball simulation game on a video game console; all prior console baseball games were arcade-style recreations of the sport.\nThe game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was \"Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball.\" It was typically shortened to \"World Series Baseball\" in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game.\nGameplay.\n\"Intellivision World Series Baseball\" displayed the batter and pitcher from a \"center field camera\" view. One player chose the pitch type, while the player batting chose when to swing when to take a pitch, and whether or not to bunt.\nOnce the ball was hit, the game switched to a \"press box camera\" view, where the defensive player could control the fielders and the batting player controlled the baserunners.\nWhen runners were on base an inset window displayed them, and the batting player could lengthen or shorten their lead and attempt to steal.\nThe game was originally written with a simplified version of Daglow's 1971 mainframe baseball statistical simulation program, so that the MLBPA license could be acquired by Mattel and the game would accurately simulate the play of real Major League Baseball players. For economic reasons in mid-1983, Mattel withdrew from this plan at the last minute, and the designers were forced to replace actual players with the names of the \"Blue Sky Rangers\" Intellivision game design team.\n\"Intellivision World Series Baseball\" is also notable for the following innovations:\nHistory.\n1980-1981.\nIn the early 1980s, video games were based on models established either by coin-op games' scrolling playfields, or board games' static background images. The screen was either a stable field on which characters moved or a top-down (sometimes angled) display that scrolled horizontally, vertically or both ways across a larger virtual image. These restrictions were created by the limited memory size of early video game consoles, where a single screen would use up much of the RAM storage space available in a machine, and small video game cartridges that held only 4K (later 8K or 16K) of ROM memory.\nDaglow was one of the original five in-house Intellivision programmers at Mattel in 1980, and had written the first known computer baseball game, \"Baseball\" on a PDP-10 mainframe computer at Pomona College in . After completing his first Intellivision cartridge \"Utopia\" in 1981, he was promoted to lead the Intellivision game development team at Mattel.\n1982.\nWhile watching a baseball game on TV in the spring of , Daglow realized that the Intellivision could mimic the same camera angles shown in the broadcast. He immediately wrote a proposal for a new baseball game. He received approval from group Vice President Gabriel Baum to start work. No current programmers were free, so Daglow began a search for someone qualified to create this new kind of game.\nHe found the right person through the job placement office of his alma mater, Pomona College. Eddie Dombrower was a programmer, animator and classically trained dancer who had invented the \"DOM dance notation system\" on the Apple II computer as a way for choreographers to record dance moves the same way composers write down music. Since \"Intellivision World Series Baseball\" would require far better animations than past video games for its TV-style display, Dombrower was considered to be a perfect fit for the job.\nBy October 1982 Dombrower had a first screen display running, complete with another first: an inset screen to show a runner taking his lead off of first base. This was the first use of an inset or picture-in-picture display in a video game.\n1983.\nBaum and Daglow showed the prototype to Mattel's marketing department, which was locked in a TV advertising war with arch-rival Atari for the position of top video game console. Although the game was not slated for completion until mid-1983, the company rushed a new TV commercial into production for Christmas, in which Intellivision spokesman George Plimpton pulled a velvet drape from a monitor and proclaimed the title to be \"the future of video games.\" Mattel's marketing strategy was to dissuade consumers from buying Atari or Coleco consoles by showing an exclusive new style of Mattel game.\nWhile the game had been announced by Plimpton in Christmas 1982, Danny Goodman of \"Radio-Electronics\" reported n June 1983 that the game was not ready for release yet. The video game crash of 1983 wiped out most of the market before \"Intellivision World Series Baseball\" ever shipped. Like most video games completed after the spring of 1983, it entered a toy store network that believed the video game era was over and that the games had been a passing fad.\nTo make matters worse, while the game could be played without the use of the Intellivoice voice synthesizer (which was already being phased out due to poorer-than-expected sales and declining user interest), it \"did\" require the then-new Intellivision Entertainment Computer System (ECS) keyboard component. Unfortunately, by the time the ECS was released, an internal shake-up at the top levels of management had shifted the company's focus away from hardware add-ons and almost exclusively towards software. As a result, the ECS was not well-promoted, and neither it nor its companion software titles sold particularly well... and since \"IWSB\" was one of the last titles made for the ECS system, very few copies were sold, making it one of the rarest Intellivision titles in the collectors' market.\nDaglow and Dombrower went on to create the hit \"Earl Weaver Baseball\" game at Electronic Arts in , where they more fully implemented the ideas behind \"Intellivision World Series Baseball\". This set the stage for the EA Sports product line. In the early and mid-1990s, Daglow led the development of the \"Tony La Russa Baseball\" games, further refining baseball simulations."

Northern Ireland also entered, this occurrence being noteworthy because Irish cricket is usually represented by an all-island Irish cricket team.\nSixteen teams entered the competition, including seven of the nine then Test-playing nations: West Indies did not enter as mentioned above, while England declined to send a team at all, on the grounds that the September date chosen clashed with other fixtures such as the end of the County Championship.\nThe strength of the teams that were entered varied somewhat. Strong squads including seasoned Test and ODI players were fielded by the three nations that eventually won medals: Bronze medalists New Zealand with Stephen Fleming and Daniel Vettori, silver medalists Australia with Steve and Mark Waugh, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Damien Fleming and Darren Lehmann and gold medalists South Africa with Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini, Mark Boucher, and Herschelle Gibbs. India and Pakistan sent weakened teams as a result of a clash with the 1998 Sahara Cup, although India still named Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and VVS Laxman in its Commonwealth team while Pakistan included Shoaib Akhtar and Arshad Khan. Other notable cricketers who took part in the Commonwealth tournament included Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene, Zimbabwe's Andy Flower and the West Indies' Curtly Ambrose and Richie Richardson, playing for their home country of Antigua and Barbuda under the Commonwealth format.\nCompetition format.\nAll matches were played at one of six grounds in Kuala Lumpur. The 16 teams were divided into four groups of four on a seeded basis. Each team played the other three once in matches, with this round robin restricted to a single week between 9 September and 15 September. Teams scored two points for a win, one for a no-result, and none for a loss. The top team in each group went forward to the knock-out stages of semi-finals and final (plus a third-place play-off). Teams with equal numbers of points were separated on net run rate, but in the event this rule was only needed to decide the minor placings.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named ahead of the tournament:\nGroup stages.\nGroup A.\nSri Lanka won all three of their games to qualify for the semi-finals. A straightforward seven-wicket victory over Malaysia (who collapsed from 87/3 to 109 all out; Sri Lanka reached 112/3) was followed by a 67-run win over Jamaica with Gunawardene hitting 107 (Sri Lanka 211/5; Jamaica 144/8), before a decider against Zimbabwe. The Africans reached 265/7 (Campbell 82, Goodwin 55); in reply, Sri Lanka stumbled to 110/5 before Hathurusingha (60) and de Saram (75*) brought them close to victory at 258/6. Streak then took three quick wickets, but the last pair survived to give Sri Lanka a one-wicket win.\nIn the other Group A games, Zimbabwe (144/4) beat Jamaica (142 all out) by six wickets, with an unbeaten 55 from Evans. Zimbabwe then scored 309/9 (Flower 70, Evans 59, Goodwin 53) as they crushed Malaysia (88 all out; Nkala 3–6) by 221 runs. The wooden spoon game saw Malaysia crumble to 83 all out thanks to 4–13 from Cunningham, losing by six wickets to Jamaica (87/4).\nGroup B.\nAustralia scored three wins out of three in this group. First came a nine wicket win over Canada who scored only 60 all out (Fleming 4–17); the Australians made 61/1 in 14 overs. In their second match, Antigua and Barbuda were dismissed for 99; Australia made 101/3 in reply. Finally, against India, Australia scored a total of 255/5, followed by India who stuttered to 109 all out.\nAntigua and Barbuda scored 164/9 (a recovery from 77/7) in a 41-over match against India, but rain fell with India 30/2 in reply and the match was declared a no-result. India's Khurasiya scored 83 against Canada in a total of 157/9, with Kumble then claiming 4–11 as the Canadians were dismissed for 45. Antigua and Barbuda (256/7) beat Canada (135 all out), with Lake making 54 before retiring hurt and then taking 4–17; Walsh also made 51 for the Antiguans.\nGroup C.\nHonours in this group went to South Africa, who started off against Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish had reached 89/5 from 38.1 overs when it rained, and the Duckworth–Lewis method was used to calculate a target of 131 from 38 overs for the South Africans, who won by making 133/6. South Africa then bowled out Bangladesh for 79 and made 80/5 for a five-wicket victory. In South Africa's final match, Barbados set 254/6 (Wallace 74), but 71 from Kallis and 54 from Gibbs saw their opponents make 257/6 with ten balls remaining.\nBarbados (160/6 in 41.3 overs) beat Bangladesh (144/7 in 47 overs, Shahriar Hossain 70*) under the Duckworth–Lewis method, and then beat Northern Ireland by 176 runs. Scores of 92 from Wallace, 66 from Griffith and 60 from Campbell contributed to a score of 296/5, which the Northern Irish never got anywhere near despite Smyth's 58, scoring just 120/7. However, Northern Ireland came back well to beat Bangladesh by 114 runs: the Northern Irish made 177 (McCallan 53) before Cooke took 5–35, as Bangladesh were dismissed for 63.\nGroup D.\nOne-day specialists New Zealand won all their matches in Group D, beginning with a comfortable five-wicket win over Kenya (Kenya 144/8; New Zealand 145/5) before an even more straightforward success against Scotland. The New Zealanders amassed 278/6 (Fleming 102, Parore 87), then Harris took 4–25 as Scotland could manage only 101 all out. Finally the Kiwis won the crunch match against Pakistan by 81 runs: New Zealand's 215/8 was boosted by 66 from Fleming despite Shoaib Akhtar's 4–47, but only three Pakistanis (and extras) reached double figures as they lost their last six wickets for 21 runs, being bowled out for 134 to slide to an 81-run defeat.\nPakistan had earlier been frustrated by rain against Scotland; they had scored 201/5 from their 50 overs (Akhtar Sarfraz 66*) and had reduced the Scots to 31/3 when the weather intervened. The Pakistanis did beat Kenya, however: Odoyo's 4–39 had restricted them to 189/8, but Arshad Khan's 4–14 and Javed Qadeer's five catches behind the stumps helped Pakistan to a 129-run win as they dismissed the Africans for only 60. Odumbe took 5–38 as Kenya kept Scotland down to 156/8; they then made 157/5 to win with 12.3 overs in hand.\nFinal group tables.\n\"Teams highlighted in yellow qualified for the semi-finals.\"\nKnockout stage (Medal round).\nSemi-finals.\nSouth Africa v Sri Lanka.\nA low-scoring game produced a thrilling climax. Gunawardene's 53 held the Sri Lankan innings together after they had been put in to bat by the South Africans, but Boje's 4–16 kept the Sri Lankans' score down to a distinctly unimpressive 130 as they were bowled out in 44 overs. In reply, South Africa lost wickets at regular intervals, with the highest score being opener Rindel's 25. At 96/9 all looked lost, but then Boje (20*) and Dawson (15*) compiled an unbroken stand of 35 for the last wicket to lead their team to 131/9 and a one-wicket victory.\nAustralia v New Zealand.\nA totally one-sided trans-Tasman clash saw New Zealand collapse to a feeble 58 all out after being sent in, with only captain Fleming reaching 20. Australian slow left-armer Brad Young took a hat-trick to finish with an exceptional bowling analysis of 4–2–4–4. In reply, the Australians rattled along at nearly six an over, losing only Mark Waugh as they raced to 62/1 in 10.5 overs and won easily.\nBronze-medal match.\nNew Zealand recovered from the trauma of their semi-final thrashing to beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs. 56 not out from Harris and 56 from Astle were the main elements of a final total of 212/7 that included three run-outs. The Sri Lankans struggled to 77/7 in their innings, and though they added 53 for the eighth wicket thanks to Perera's 45, it was never likely to be enough and they were bowled out for 161.\nGold-medal match.\nPut in by South Africa after losing the toss, the Australians were indebted to captain Steve Waugh's unbeaten 90 as they recovered from 58/4 to post a still below-par 183 all out. Opposing captain Pollock was the chief destroyer for South Africa, with 4–19 from nine tight overs to remove Mark Waugh, Ponting, Gilchrist and Lehmann. South Africa got off to a good start in their reply with an opening partnership of 73 between Rindel (67) and Hudson (36). A burst of wickets from Lehmann (3–14) saw the South Africans wobble as they fell from 158/2 to 183/6, but the Proteas did not lose another wicket and Kallis' watchful 44 from 96 balls saw South Africa through to 184/6 and the gold medal with four overs to spare.\nLegacy.\nGold medal-winning South African captain Pollock praised the Commonwealth experience while recalling his time at the Games for Cricinfo.\nThe success of the IPL led to a T20 tournament in the Commonwealth Games and later the Olympics being considered. The president of the Commonwealth Games federation wanted to bring cricket back into the games, and the Glasgow bid for the 2014 games had indicated that they would include cricket, but it did not materialise. The ICC then rejected an offer for cricket to feature in the 2018 games on the Gold Coast, but a T20 women's tournament was held at Edgbaston for the 2022 games in Birmingham.\nThe next year at the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai in October 2023, cricket was added to the Olympic program in the form of men's and women's T20 events beginning in Los Angeles in 2028. It marks the first appearance of cricket as an Olympic sport since Paris in 1900."

He played for seven teams during his career, including two stints with the Boston Celtics.\nCareer.\nFollowing a collegiate career which began at Burlington County College in New Jersey, then two years at Vincennes University in Indiana, followed by Providence College in Rhode Island, the 6' 8\" small forward was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 14th pick in the 1995 NBA draft. He played two years with them before being traded to the Denver Nuggets during the 1997 offseason for a couple of second round draft picks. The Nuggets only got four games out of Williams during the 1997-98 campaign due to him tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The following season, he returned, but only played in 38 of 82 regular season games with Denver before they repatriated him back to Boston along with Danny Fortson and Eric Washington plus a future draft pick in exchange for Ron Mercer, Ronald \"Popeye\" Jones, and Dwayne Schintzius. His second tenure with the Celtics lasted over four seasons until they traded him to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with Tony Battie and Kedrick Brown in a swap for Ricky Davis, Chris Mihm, Michael Stewart, and a second round draft pick on December 15, 2003. He became a free agent after 50 games with the Cavaliers, and signed with the New Jersey Nets prior to the 2004–05 season. Williams was soon part of a blockbuster player trade when the Nets sent him, Aaron Williams, Alonzo Mourning and two future first-round draft picks to the Toronto Raptors for franchise player Vince Carter.\nIn 2005, Williams decided to launch his own line of clothing honoring the fictional Negro Basketball League.\nOn June 21, 2006, Williams was traded with Matt Bonner and a second round pick in the 2009 NBA draft to San Antonio for Rasho Nesterovič and cash.\nOn February 13, 2007 he was traded along with the 2nd round pick in the 2009 NBA draft that the Spurs got from the Raptors to the Charlotte Bobcats for Melvin Ely.

        "title": "Ben Chapman (baseball)",
        "text": "William Benjamin Chapman (December 25, 1908 – July 7, 1993) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from 1930 to 1946, most prominently as a member of the New York Yankees where, he was a four-time All-Star player, and was a member of the 1932 World Series winning team.\nDuring the period from 1926 to 1943, Chapman had more stolen bases than any other player, leading the American League (AL) four times. After 12 seasons, during which he batted .302 and led the AL in assists and double plays twice each, he spent two years in the minor leagues and returned to the majors as a National League pitcher for three seasons, becoming player-manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, his final team.\nChapman's accomplishments as a player were overshadowed by the role he played in 1947 as manager of the Phillies, antagonizing Jackie Robinson by shouting racist epithets and opposing his presence on a major league team on the basis of Robinson's race with unsportsmanlike conduct that was an embarrassment for his team. He was fired the following season and never managed in the majors again.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1908, Chapman batted and threw right-handed. He was a teammate of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, and other stars on the Yankees from 1930 through the middle of the 1936 season. In his 1930 rookie season with the Yankees, during which he batted .316, Chapman played exclusively in the infield as a second and third baseman. Although he played only 91 games at third, he led the AL in errors, and after Joe Sewell was acquired in the offseason, Chapman was shifted to the outfield to take advantage of his speed and throwing arm. \nChapman's batting average dipped one point in 1931, but he hit a career-high 17 home runs along with 122 runs batted in and 61 stolen bases. His 1931 total of 61 stolen bases was the highest by a Yankee since Fritz Maisel's 74 in 1914, and was the most by any major leaguer between 1921 and 1961 (equalled only by George Case in 1943). He was the first player with 100 or more runs batted in and 60 or more stolen bases in a season since the end of the Dead-ball era. Joe Morgan () and Ronald Acuña Jr. () are the only other players to accomplish the feat during the Live-ball era. He led the AL in stolen bases for the next three seasons (1931–33),\nWith the Yankees, Chapman also batted over .300 and scored 100 runs four times each, drove in 100 runs twice, led the AL in triples in 1934, and made each of the first three AL All-Star teams from 1933 to 1935, leading off in the 1933 game as the first AL hitter in All-Star history. In one game on July 9, 1932, Chapman hit three home runs, two of which were inside-the-park. In the 1932 World Series, he batted .294 with six runs batted in as the Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs.\nIt was in New York that the extent of Chapman's bigotry first surfaced. He taunted Jewish fans at Yankee Stadium with Nazi salutes and disparaging epithets. In a 1933 game, his intentional spiking of Washington Senators' second baseman Buddy Myer (who was believed to be Jewish)\ncaused a 20-minute brawl that saw 300 fans participate and resulted in five-game suspensions and $100 fines for each of the players involved.\nIn June 1936, Chapman – then hitting .266 and expendable with the arrival of DiMaggio – was traded to the Senators. The player the Yankees received in return was Jake Powell, who would become infamous for a 1938 radio interview in which he stated that he liked to crack Blacks over the head with his nightstick as a police officer during the off-season.\nChapman rebounded following the trade to finish the year with a .315 average, again making the All-Star team, scoring 100 runs and collecting a career-high 50 doubles. The Senators sent him to the Boston Red Sox in June 1937, and that season he led the AL in steals for the fourth time with 35. The following year, he hit a career-best .340 with Boston, after which he was traded to the Cleveland Indians. After two seasons in which he hit .290 and .286, Cleveland sent Chapman back to Washington in December 1940. He hit .255 in his return to the Senators before they released him in May 1941. The Chicago White Sox then picked him up, but after he batted only .226 over the remainder of the year, his major league career appeared to be finished.\nManagerial career.\nAfter managing in the Class B Piedmont League in 1942 and 1944 – he was suspended for the 1943 season for punching an umpire – Chapman resurfaced as a pitcher in the National League with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1944, earning five wins against three losses. After starting the next year 3–3, he was traded to the Phillies on June 15, 1945, becoming player-manager on June 30. He made three relief appearances for the team that year, played his final game in 1946 with innings of relief, and continued as a non-playing manager. He appeared in 1,717 games over 15 seasons, batting .302 lifetime with 1,958 hits, 407 doubles, 107 triples, 90 home runs, 824 walks, 1,144 runs, 977 runs batted in, and 287 stolen bases, and winning eight of 14 decisions as a pitcher; his 184 steals with the Yankees placed him second in team history behind Hal Chase.\nJackie Robinson.\nChapman had replaced Freddie Fitzsimmons as manager of the Phillies in 1945 with that team buried in last place (winner of only 17 of 68 games). The team improved somewhat through the end of the year, and climbed to fifth place in 1946, the first year of the postwar baseball boom and the last season in which the color line was in effect. In April 1947, Brooklyn called up Jackie Robinson from the Montreal Royals and made him their regular first baseman. Chapman's Phillies were not the only NL team to oppose racial integration – several Dodger players tried to petition management to keep him off the team – but during an early-season series in Brooklyn, the level of verbal abuse directed by Chapman and his players at Robinson reached such proportions that it made headlines in the New York and national press. Chapman instructed his pitchers, whenever they had a 3–0 count against Robinson, to bean him rather than walk him.\nChapman's attempts to intimidate Robinson eventually backfired, with the Dodgers rallying behind Robinson, and there was increased sympathy for Robinson in many circles. The backlash against Chapman was so severe that he was asked to pose in a photograph with Robinson as a conciliatory gesture when the two teams next met in Philadelphia in May. This incident prompted Robinson's teammate Dixie Walker to comment, \"I never thought I'd see old Ben eat shit like that.\"\nRobinson went on to stardom and a 10-year career, a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame, and a revered position in American sporting and civil rights history. Chapman's baseball career, however, was coming to an end. He survived the 1947 season, but the Phillies fell to seventh place. In July 1948, with the team still in seventh, Chapman was fired and eventually replaced by Eddie Sawyer. He surfaced one more time in the majors, as a coach for the 1952 Cincinnati Reds. Chapman's career major league managing record was 196–276 (.415).\nIn an interview with journalist Ray Robinson in the 1990s, Chapman stated, \"A man learns about things and mellows as he grows older. I think that maybe I've changed a bit. Maybe I went too far in those days. But I always went along with the bench jockeying, which has always been part of the game. Maybe I was rougher at it than some other players. I thought that you could use it to upset and weaken the other team. It might give you an advantage. The world changes.\" Reflecting on the success of his son, then coaching black players on an integrated football team, \"Look, I'm real proud I've raised my son different. And he gets along well with them. They like him. That's a nice thing, don't you think?\"\nPersonal life.\nChapman's first wife, Mary Elizabeth Payne, divorced Chapman on June 11, 1935, getting the divorce in Birmingham, Alabama. In the divorce petition, Payne charged Chapman with domestic violence.\nChapman later worked in insurance in Alabama. He was a consultant on \"Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His Time\", Ray Robinson's 2006 biography of Lou Gehrig.\nIn 1993, Chapman died of a heart attack at age 84 at his home in Hoover, Alabama. He was interred at Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery.\nIn popular culture.\nThe newspaper headline \"Red Sox beat Yanks 5–4 on Chapman's Homer\", a possibly intentional pun on the title of John Keats' poem \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", is mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's 1962 novel \"Pale Fire\" (lines 97–98), where it is misinterpreted by the character Charles Kinbote. Sources disagree on whether the headline is genuine or not.\nIn Harry Turtledove's 2003 alternate history novel \"Southern Victory: \", one of the Freedom Party Guards appears to be Chapman.\nIn the 2013 film \"42\", Chapman is played by Alan Tudyk and is portrayed as an antagonist in the film.\nIn season 25, episode 17 of \"The Simpsons\", Homer compares Marge to “being that racist Philadelphia manager” due to her not supporting him wanting to become a competitive eater due to his prior heart problems (comparing himself to Jackie Robinson), to which Marge replied “quit comparing me to Ben Chapman” (implying that Homer has made the comparison in the past)."

        "title": "Roundarm bowling",
        "text": "In cricket, roundarm bowling is a bowling style that was introduced in the first quarter of the 19th century and largely superseded underarm bowling by the 1830s. Using a roundarm action, the bowlers extend their arm about 90 degrees from their body at the point where they release the ball. Roundarm fell into decline after 1864 when the current style of overarm bowling was legalised, although W. G. Grace continued to use it to the end of his career.\nOrigin.\nThe spread of roundarm in the 1820s was a natural reaction to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the legalisation of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions.\nThe idea of roundarm is sometimes attributed to Christiana Willes, sister of Kent cricketer John Willes. The story goes that when bowling to her brother in the garden at home in the 1800s, Willes found herself inconvenienced by her large, lead-weighted dress which prevented her from performing the underarm action. Elevating the arm to just above waist height, she bowled without interference from her attire. According to John Major in \"More Than A Game\", the story is unlikely to be true for reasons of fashion more than cricket because hooped skirts were out of fashion during the period of the Napoleonic War.\nRoundarm was said to have been devised in the 1790s by Tom Walker, known as \"Old Everlasting\". Walker was a famous opening batsman who had a solid defensive technique and was notoriously difficult to dismiss. He was also a more than useful bowler who was always looking for ways to improvise. Legend has it that he and some of his fellow players in the \"Hambledon Era\" used to practise in a barn during the winters. Walker worked out that he could generate more bounce and variation of pace if he bowled with his arm away from his body and soon realised that these deliveries gave the batsman added problems. He tried to use the style in important matches but was no-balled and had to return to his usual underarm lobs, with which he was by no means unsuccessful.\nProhibition and eventual legalisation.\nWhatever the origin, John Willes realised that the pace and bounce generated by this raised arm action made the delivery potentially more difficult to play than a conventional underarm one and so he adopted the style himself with his arm coming through at shoulder height. He tried, without success, to have it accepted in senior cricket.\nThe matter was controversial enough for a law to be introduced in 1816 into the Laws of Cricket to prohibit roundarm: \nThe ball must be bowled (not thrown or jerked), and be delivered underhand, with the hand below the elbow. But if the ball be jerked, or the arm extended from the body horizontally, and any part of the hand be uppermost, or the hand horizontally extended when the ball is delivered, the Umpires shall call, \"No Ball\".\nOn 15 July 1822, in the MCC v Kent match at Lord's, Willes opened the bowling for Kent and was promptly no-balled for using his roundarm action. He had been trying at various times to introduce the style since 1807. Being no-balled on this occasion was the final straw, for Willes reportedly threw the ball away and withdrew from the match, literally going straight to his horse and riding away. He refused to play again in any important fixture.\nAlthough Willes had quit the game, he had made his point and others were willing to pick his ball up and persevere. In 1826, Sussex had the best team in England and were acclaimed as the \"Champion County\" in some quarters. Their success owed much to the prowess of two top-class bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge, both of whom were champions of the roundarm style, when they could get away with it. Lillywhite was one of the all-time great bowlers and was nicknamed \"the Nonpareil\".\nIn 1827, to test the validity of roundarm bowling, three All-England v Sussex roundarm trial matches were arranged, but no immediate decision was made about legalisation. Lillywhite and Broadbridge used roundarm to great effect against the England batsmen who made loud objections.\nBut the batsmen were losing the argument. In 1828, following the Sussex v England roundarm trials, MCC modified Rule 10 to permit the bowler's hand to be raised as high as the elbow. Lillywhite, Broadbridge and their supporters continued to bowl at shoulder height and the umpires did not no-ball them.\nBy 1835, powerless to prevent the use of roundarm, MCC finally amended the Laws of Cricket to make it legal. The relevant part of the Law stated: \"if the hand be above the shoulder in the delivery, the umpire must call 'No Ball'.\" It was not long before bowlers' hands started to go above the shoulder and the 1835 Law had to be reinforced in 1845 by removing benefit of the doubt from the bowler in the matter of his hand's height when delivering the ball.\nLegacy.\nAlthough underarm bowlers did not fade away, roundarm became the predominant style until another controversy erupted about overarm in 1864. Prominent roundarm bowlers to succeed Lillywhite and Broadbridge were Alfred Mynn, John Jackson and W. G. Grace.\nIn the modern game, the Sri Lankan pace bowler Lasith Malinga has a very distinctive action which is authentic roundarm, earning him the name \"Slinga Malinga\". There are some who question the legality of this action, but it is legal, because his arm does not straighten from a bent position as he bowls. This is the strict definition of bowling \"vis-à-vis\" throwing. In fact, many bowlers bowl with a slightly bent arm; the key is that they do not straighten it as they bowl."

        "text": "1896 was the seventh season of County Championship cricket in England. Yorkshire won the championship title having lost only losing three of their 26 matches, setting a points percentage record with 68.42. Yorkshire's team did not possess the greatest performers statistically, such as Sussex with Ranjitsinhji, or Gloucestershire with W. G. Grace, but a well-rounded squad with four bowlers taking more than 70 wickets in the Championship and five batsmen scoring over 1000 runs gave them the title. Playing against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in May, Yorkshire scored 887 in their first innings, which is still the highest total in the history of the County Championship.\nThe highlight of the season, however, was the Australian tour, where Australia won their first Test match in England since 1888, and gave England a fight up until the third Test. On a rain-affected pitch, however, England hauled in a 66-run third test victory thanks to Bobby Peel, who took six for 23. The win sealed the Ashes in favour of England by 2 wins to 1.\nCounty Championship.\nFinal table.\nPoints system:\nAshes tour.\nEngland won again, but this time faced a series-decider in the final match at The Oval, without George Lohmann of Surrey and William Gunn of Nottinghamshire, who went on a strike over match fees allegedly received by the amateur WG Grace. In the first Test at Lord's, England won by six wickets, chasing 108 to win, but Australia recovered to win the second Test at Old Trafford, despite 154 from Ranjitsinhji on debut - as the first Indian to play Test cricket, and only the second to score a century on Test debut. The third Test was ravaged by rain, and in poor playing conditions England won by 66 runs. The highest individual score in that match was 47 from Australian Joe Darling."

        "title": "Dave Duncan (baseball)",
        "text": "David Edwin Duncan (born September 26, 1945) is an American pitching consultant for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is also a former professional baseball catcher and pitching coach. He began his MLB playing career in 1964 and played again consecutively from 1967 to 1976 for the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Baltimore Orioles.\nAfter retiring as a player, Duncan served as the pitching coach for the Indians, Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. Four pitchers he coached won the Cy Young Award in 1983, 1990, 1992, and 2005. He was also a member of four World Series champion teams in 1972, 1989, 2006, and 2011. Each year from 1983 to 2011, Duncan worked with former manager Tony La Russa on the White Sox, Athletics, and Cardinals. Following the 2013 season, he became a pitching consultant for the Diamondbacks.\nPlaying career.\nMinor leagues (1963–66).\nDuncan was signed as an amateur free agent by the Kansas City Athletics in 1963, as a 17-year-old out of Crawford High School in San Diego. In his first at-bat as a professional baseball player, he hit a home run for the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League. Duncan made his major league debut on May 6, 1964 at the age of 18, becoming the youngest player in the American League at the time. He was kept in the majors to protect him from being drafted by another team under baseball rules.\nDuncan returned to the minor leagues for the next two seasons, first with the Lewiston Broncs in the Single-A Northwest League in Lewiston, Idaho. Midway through the 1965 season, Rick Monday joined the team. A 19-year-old sophomore center fielder with Arizona State, Monday had led the Sun Devils to the 1965 College World Series title on June 12 and was the first pick in the first major league draft four days earlier. After the season, Duncan and Monday entered boot camp with the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego in September.\nThe following year in 1966, Duncan led the California League with 46 home runs in 121 games for the Modesto Reds, the A's affiliate. The second pick in the 1966 MLB draft was another Arizona State center fielder, 20-year-old Reggie Jackson. He played two weeks in Lewiston then joined Duncan in Modesto in early July, and kept pace with 21 homers in 56 games.\nKansas City/Oakland Athletics (1967–72).\nDuncan began the 1967 season with the Birmingham A's but, was brought back up to the major leagues in early June. When his batting average dropped to a .194 in early July, he was returned to Birmingham to work on his hitting. When his hitting showed signs of improvement, Duncan returned to the major leagues in September, along with Jackson and Joe Rudi.\nAthletics' team owner Charlie Finley moved the franchise west to Oakland for the 1968 season, but Duncan started the season with the Vancouver Mounties of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He was called up to the majors in June when catcher Jim Pagliaroni suffered a broken arm and went on the disabled list. Duncan went on to catch the majority of the team's games in 1968. While he possessed good defensive skills, he only managed to hit for a .191 batting average. His batting average fell further to .126 in 1969 and Phil Roof took over as the Athletic's main catcher. Duncan's hitting improved in 1970 to a career-high .259 batting average along with 10 home runs and 29 runs batted in as, he shared catching duties with Frank Fernández and Gene Tenace, who was called up to the major leagues late in the season. He also missed time due to his commitment to the military reserves. When Duncan made adverse comments about Finley during the season, the owner fired Athletics manager John McNamara in October for failing to control his players, despite the team's second-place finish in the American League Western Division.\nThe 1971 season saw Duncan become the Athletics main catcher, as he guided their pitching staff to finish second in the league in earned run average as well as in strikeouts. Duncan was the catcher for two 20-game winners in 1971, as Vida Blue won 24 games and Catfish Hunter won 21 games. His offense continued to improve, hitting 10 home runs by mid-season and, was selected as a reserve on the 1971 American League All-Star team, replacing Ray Fosse who missed the game due to an injury. Duncan finished the season with a .253 average with 15 home runs, 40 runs batted in while leading American League catchers in range factor. The Athletics would win the American League Western Division but, were defeated by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 American League Championship Series.\n1972 would be Duncan's best season offensively as he hit 19 home runs with 59 runs batted in, although his batting average slipped to .218. He committed only five errors in 113 games played for a career-high .993 fielding percentage, second only to Johnny Oates among American League catchers. With Duncan calling the pitches, the Athletics' pitching staff led the league in winning percentage and in shutouts and, once again finished second in earned run average as, the team captured their second consecutive Western Division title. Despite Duncan's production, Athletics manager Dick Williams, a proponent of the platoon system, began using Gene Tenace as the starting catcher during the last month of the season. The Athletics defeated the Detroit Tigers in the 1972 American League Championship Series and then the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.\nCleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles (1973–76).\nAlthough Duncan joined the Athletics in spring training, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with Finley. He was traded along with George Hendrick to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Fosse and Jack Heidemann on March 24, 1973. Duncan became the Indians' starting catcher in 1973 however, he broke his wrist on June 28 and missed two months of the season. He finished the season hitting for a .233 average with 17 home runs and 43 runs batted in while leading American League catchers in range factor. He played in a career-high 136 games in the 1974 season but, the heavy workload caused his batting average to fall to .200. Duncan was acquired along with minor league outfielder Alvin McGrew by the Baltimore Orioles from the Indians for Boog Powell and Don Hood on February 25 1975. With the Orioles, Duncan shared catching duties with Elrod Hendricks during the 1975 season before Rick Dempsey took over as the Orioles starting catcher in 1976. Duncan was dealt from the Orioles to the Chicago White Sox for Pat Kelly on November 18, 1976. When the White Sox released him in March 1977, he retired as a player at the age of 32.\nCareer statistics.\nIn an eleven-year major league career, Duncan played in 929 games, accumulating 617 hits in 2,885 at-bats for a .214 career batting average along with 109 home runs, 341 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .279. While he was a light-hitting player, he excelled as a defensive catcher, ending his career with a .984 fielding percentage. He was respected during his playing career for his defensive skills and for his knowledge of the game of baseball. In spite of his low average he hit 109 home runs, one for every 26.5 at-bats. During his time with the Athletics, he first met future manager Tony La Russa, then a utility infielder with the club.\nCoaching career.\nDuncan began his coaching career in 1978 with the Cleveland Indians. After a stint as a pitching coach for the Seattle Mariners in 1982, he joined former teammate La Russa, then the manager of the Chicago White Sox. From that time they worked in tandem as manager and pitching coach, joining Oakland in 1986 and then the Cardinals in 1996. Beginning in 1986, first base coach Dave McKay also began a long tenure of working with Duncan and La Russa. The three men continued to work together until the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series. La Russa retired immediately after that World Series and Duncan retired from coaching less than three months later. McKay also moved on, accepting the first base coaching role with the Chicago Cubs.\nPitchers on Duncan's staffs won four Cy Young Awards: LaMarr Hoyt in 1983; Bob Welch in 1990; Dennis Eckersley in 1992; and Chris Carpenter in 2005. Dave Stewart, who had not found consistent success before signing with Oakland as a free agent in 1986, won 20 or more games and pitched 250 or more innings four straight seasons from 1987 to 1990. From 1988 through 1990, Oakland pitchers had the lowest earned run average (ERA) in the American League, and the 2005 St. Louis staff had the lowest ERA in the majors. La Russa regularly credits Duncan as being a key factor in the success of the teams he managed for over 25 years.\nIn October 2010, Duncan signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him with the Cardinals through 2012 with an option for 2013. He took an indeterminate leave of absence from the Cardinals on January 5, 2012, to spend time with his wife, Jeanine, who was dealing with cancer. Duncan's semi-retirement effectively ended his tenure with the Cardinals. During his sixteen seasons as the Cardinals' pitching coach, the pitching staff had the third-lowest overall ERA in MLB as well as the third-lowest starters' ERA.\nPitching consultant career.\nOn November 13, 2013, the Arizona Diamondbacks announced they had hired Duncan to be a special assistant to general manager Kevin Towers as a pitching consultant. \"With Dave, he's going to set his own schedule and it will depend on what he wants to do and what he's capable of doing\", Towers commented of his role. \"During spring training, be available to work with pitchers, catchers and pitching coaches as they're preparing for a game. Breaking down video of pitchers we might be considering for the draft. Plus, targeting guys in our system and getting his input – who he likes, who is close.\"\nPersonal life.\nDuncan lives in Kimberling City, Missouri. He resided with his wife, Jeanine, until her death on June 6, 2013, after a battle against glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.\nHis younger son, Chris, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and made his major league debut in 2005. Chris died on September 6, 2019, from glioblastoma. His older son, Shelley, was selected in the second round of the 2001 draft by the New York Yankees and debuted in the Major Leagues on July 20, 2007.\nDuncan has two daughters from his first marriage, Tiffany Duncan and Devannie Duncan, who both reside in Orange County, California.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "1772 English cricket season",
        "text": "In the 1772 English cricket season, it became normal practice to complete match scorecards and there are surviving examples from every subsequent season. Scorecards from 1772 have been found for three eleven-a-side matches in which the Hampshire county team played against an England team, and for one top-class single wicket match between Kent and Hampshire. The three Hampshire v England matches have been unofficially recognised by certain sources as first-class, although no such standard existed at the time. Prior to 1772, only four scorecards have survived, the last from a minor match in 1769.\nHampshire won two and lost one of their matches against England. Kent won the single wicket match. Hampshire teams were organised by the Hambledon Club and played their home matches on Broadhalfpenny Down, near the village of Hambledon, Hampshire. John Small, the Hampshire batsman, scored the most runs in the three scored matches; no details of bowling or fielding have survived.\nWhile details are scarce, reports exist of four other eleven-a-side matches. Two involved a combined Hampshire and Sussex team playing against Kent and it has been suggested that Hambledon may have been a two counties club. There was a match between Surrey and Hampshire of which only the result is known. In the north of England, the Sheffield and Nottingham clubs met at an unknown venue in Sheffield.\nScorecards.\nThe earliest known scorecards were created for two matches in 1744 but, before 1772, only two more have been found – one each from minor matches played in 1751 and 1769. Three scorecards exist from top-class matches played in 1772, when completion became normal practice, and there are surviving cards from every subsequent season.\nHampshire v England, Broadhalfpenny Down, 24–25 June.\nIn the match at Broadhalfpenny Down on 24–25 June, Hampshire won by 53 runs for a stake of 500 guineas. Hampshire teams were organised by the Hambledon Club and one source for this match has called the team Hambledon while, in other accounts, the England team has been called \"Kent, Middlesex and Surrey\".\nHampshire had two given men: William Yalden and John Edmeads, both of Surrey. Yalden was a noted wicket-keeper and Hampshire's regular keeper Tom Sueter was also playing, but it is not known which of them kept wicket in this match. On the England side, Gill of Buckinghamshire is known to have been a wicket-keeper. Hampshire batsman John Small's score of 78 is the highest recorded in the 1772 season and, as such, it established the record for the highest individual score definitely recorded in a senior or top-class match. According to contemporary newspaper reports, \"bets of £500 were laid against John Minshull in favour of John Small\".\nEngland v Hampshire, Guildford Bason, 23–24 July.\nThe match at Guildford Bason on 23–24 July was also won by Hampshire, this time by 62 runs and again for a stake of 500 guineas. Richard Simmons of Kent was the England wicket-keeper in this match and the next one.\nF. S. Ashley-Cooper calls the teams Hambledon and All England when referring to confusion about the extras: \"In the course of the game, the Hambledon Club (\"sic\") got 11 notches in byes and All-England (\"sic\") 21, but they were not entered in the scoresheet\". He gave the match scores as 144 and 118 to 117 and 73 with Hampshire winning by 72 runs; however, these totals have Hampshire scoring 12 byes and England scoring 22, which is the same as the scorecard (the margin excluding extras is correct).\nEngland v Hampshire, Bourne Park, 19–20 August.\nThe third match was played on 19–20 August at Bourne Paddock, Bishopsbourne, near Canterbury. England won by two wickets and the scorecard shows that Joseph Miller and John Boorman were the not out batsmen when the match ended, while Dick May did not bat. Yalden and Edmeads again played for Hampshire as given men. Hampshire's captain, all-rounder Richard Nyren, missed this match and was replaced by Thomas Ridge.\nArthur Haygarth noted that the England team in this match was called Kent in another account, though he called it England; the team included nine Kent players with Lumpy Stevens and Thomas White from Surrey.\nPlayers.\nMany scorecards in the 18th century lack details and so it is difficult to create any analysis of playing performances. The three scorecards in 1772 provide only the team totals and the runs scored by each batsman. There is no bowling or fielding data. John Small of Hampshire scored the most runs with 213. William Yalden scored 136 for Hampshire as a given man and Joseph Miller of England scored 98.\nA total of 28 players (12 for Hampshire; 16 for England) took part in the three matches. Hampshire's players were Edward Aburrow Jr, William Barber, Thomas Brett, John Edmeads, William Hogsflesh, George Leer, Richard Nyren, Thomas Ridge, John Small, Peter \"Buck\" Stewart, Tom Sueter and William Yalden. The England players were John Boorman, Childs, John Frame, James Fuggles, Gill, Dick May, Tom May, Joseph Miller, John Minshull, Page, William Palmer, Thomas Pattenden, Richard Simmons, Lumpy Stevens, Thomas White and John Wood.\nSingle wicket.\nA top-class five-a-side match was played under single wicket rules at the Artillery Ground on Tuesday, 2 June between teams representing Hampshire and Kent. It was a two innings match. Hampshire scored 11 and 46; Kent scored 35 and 23 for 4 wickets to win by one wicket. The Kent players were John Boorman, John Frame, Dick May, John Minshull and Joseph Miller. Minshull scored 26 and 11; Frame scored the winning run. The Hampshire players were John Small, Tom Sueter, George Leer, Thomas Brett and Richard Nyren. Nyren scored 29 out of 46 in the second innings.\nOther events.\nBesides the scorecards of the three matches above, reports have survived of four more eleven-a-side matches in 1772.\nAfter their first known meeting in 1771, the Sheffield and Nottingham clubs played a match on Monday, 1 June at an unknown location in Sheffield. Nottingham conceded defeat after being dismissed for 14 and then seeing Sheffield score 70 with wickets still in hand. A pre-match announcement appeared in the (Nottingham) \"Daily Messenger\" on Tuesday, 25 May, and the paper followed up with a report on Friday, 12 June.\nIn August, Kent played two matches against a combined Hampshire and Sussex team. The first, on 10–11 August, was at Broadhalfpenny Down and the combined team won by 50 runs. The stake was 500 guineas but, apart from the result, no details of the match are known. The second match, on 26–27 August, was played at Guildford Bason and Kent won by innings and 29 runs. In his notes about this match, G. B. Buckley says: \"Hampshire &amp; Sussex = Hambledon Club\", adding weight to the theory that Hambledon was a two counties club. The bets placed seem to have been mainly around how many runs the Duke of Dorset would score compared with one Mr Ellis, a now unknown player. It is possible that this was a \"gentlemen only\" match and the same may be true of the match on 10 August. The report was in the \"General Evening Post\" on Saturday, 29 August.\nOn Friday, 28 August, there was a Surrey v Hampshire match at Guildford Bason which Hampshire won by 45 runs. No details are known except the result.\nTwo matches in June involved the Blackheath club against teams designated as counties but, as Buckley says, \"the alleged Kent team cannot have been representative\" and they are minor matches only. Another Kent match against a team called London and Middlesex apparently took place at the Artillery Ground on Tuesday, 11 August, the same day as the Hampshire and Sussex v Kent match above. It is believed that this was not a representative match, especially given the stakes on offer at Hambledon."

        "title": "Wales national cricket team",
        "text": "Cricketers from Wales are currently represented by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and compete for the England cricket team. There have been some historical instances of a separate Welsh team in the 1920–30s, in the 1979 ICC Trophy, and in the British Isles Championship between 1993 and 2001, however Wales is not a separate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). \nSome politicians in Wales have argued for Wales to achieve separate ICC status from England and field a Wales cricket team, citing representation and opportunities as contributing factors, and following the establishment of a Scotland team from the England team in 1994. Cricket bodies in Wales, such as Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club oppose such proposals, citing finances and early difficulties. The ECB is neutral on the proposal, whereas the Welsh Government states it is for the cricket bodies to decide, but recognises the opportunity for Sophia Gardens in Cardiff to host England matches. Various cricketers have supported either side of the proposal.\nHistory.\nA Wales national team existed in the 1920s and 1930s playing against touring sides such as the West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand and secured a win against the West Indies in 1928. The team was assembled to play first-class matches, and was mainly supported by the Welsh Cricket Union and Gwilym Rowland, a Denbighshire-based businessman. There were plans for Home Internationals with Ireland and Scotland teams but plans for an annual series were not advanced. From 1923 to 1930 Wales played 16 first-class matches. \nThe Welsh Cricket Association was formed in 1969 and for the next three decades they played against other ICC teams. Wales competed in the 1979 ICC Trophy as a non-ICC team, playing by invitation after the late withdrawal of Gibraltar. Wales won two of four matches, against the Netherlands and Israel, and narrowly missing out on a place in the semi-finals to the United States. Among the Welsh wins was a match narrowly won against the Netherlands which was effected by rain. Welsh players that played in the tournament included William Douglas Slade. Between 1993 and 2001, a Welsh team played in the British Isles Championship, alongside Ireland, Scotland and an English XI team.\nBetween 2002 and 2004, a Wales cricket team was assembled by Glamorgan County Cricket Club, competing against England three times in One-Day Internationals in Cardiff, winning one of the matches.\nHistorically, the England team represented Great Britain, until Scotland became an independent ICC member in 1994. With former Welsh cricketer Robert Croft, previously representing Glamorgan and England, viewing the modern England team as comparable to the British &amp; Irish Lions. Whereas Welsh Labour AM Mike Hedges stated that the Ireland and Scotland teams are actually \"feeder teams\" for the England team. However the use of the term \"England\", omitting Wales, has been criticised, and Scottish cricket executives are optimistic of their team's development.\nCurrent status.\nThe \"Wales seniors friendly team\" is the only senior men's Wales team listed by Cricket Wales. There are also Wales teams in ages up to U18.\nThe Wales National County Cricket Club competes in the National Counties of English and Welsh cricket competitions, representing all of Wales outside of Glamorgan, which is represented by Glamorgan County Cricket Club in first-class competitions.\nThe women's team played in the Women's European Cricket Championship in 2005, which Wales hosted, but have since adopted the same system as the men's team, with female players from Wales to represent the England women's cricket team.\nWales is currently represented by the England and Wales Cricket Board, internationally competing as the England cricket team. With Welsh players such as Simon Jones and Geraint Jones competing for the England team, such as during their 2005 Ashes series win.\nProposals for standalone Wales team.\nWales is currently represented by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), however there have been some calls for Wales to have their own international cricket team like Scotland and Ireland, by various Welsh organisations, publications and public figures. Cricket Wales, the sport's governing body in Wales, and Glamorgan County Cricket Club, have expressed their opposition to any separate team, in particular over finances and potential exclusion from the County Championship, in which reductions in either would \"have a significant negative impact [to the sport in Wales]\". Cardiff Council and the Welsh Government view being part of the ECB as an opportunity to build-up Cardiff's reputation in cricket and as a sporting hub. The ECB is neutral on the proposal.\nSupport.\nPoliticians across the political spectrum have stated their support for a standalone team such as Jonathan Edwards, Bethan Sayed, Adam Price and Mohammad Asghar, with Sayed stating in 2013 that \"Wales is the second-oldest cricket playing country in the world, yet it is alone in the British Isles in not having its own national side\", and Asghar stating in 2021 \"if Afghanistan can play world cricket, then for God’s sake Wales should\" and that playing on the international stage would \"raise Wales' profile\" and be economically beneficial while dismissing concerns from Glamorgan. Former Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones called in 2017 to reintroduce the Wales one-day team stating, \"[It] is odd that we see Ireland and Scotland playing in international tournaments and not Wales\", although if only Glamorgan's finances were not hit. Price stated in 2009, that \"there are a great number of cricket teams in Wales [...] [but] no national side. In Carmarthenshire [...] [many] cricketers [...] could go on to represent Wales given the right opportunities\". Price also added, \"Many people argue that Wales is already represented in the England and Wales Cricket Board (the EWCB). But how often do you hear the second letter pronounced by the media or even game officials?\", and that support for the team can be provided by the Welsh Government and ICC development funds for new nations.\nIn June 2010 a motion for establishing a \"Welsh International 20-20 and one day cricket team\" was tabled to the UK parliament. In October 2011, a petition was made to the Welsh Assembly for a Wales national cricket team. A 2013 Assembly debate was held on the topic with both Conservative and Labour members supporting the establishment of a Welsh team.\nBethan Sayed argued at a 2015 Assembly petition committee that Wales should have its own team, stating that Wales has more cricket players (7,500) than Ireland (6,000) which has its own team and twice the population, and that the idea is \"an emotive subject\". Calls were also made for a separate team following England's early departure from the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia.\nPlaid Cymru included the proposal in its 2016 National Assembly for Wales election manifesto, although the issue was not part of negotiations with Welsh Labour.\nThere have been suggestions that the Hundred makes a Wales national cricket team more likely, as the ECB considers reducing County Championship matches putting Glamorgan at risk of not participating in high-level matches. Therefore potentially causing a Welsh cricket team as a response.\nCricket Ireland and Cricket Scotland have overseen growth in the sport in their nations from a smaller base than Wales, and Cricket Scotland has expressed that developments in increased international fixtures with other teams from Ireland and the Netherlands can allow a Scottish team \"to prosper\".\nCriticisms of the ECB have also been expressed as reasons for Wales to have its own team. With critics questioning the ECB team being portrayed as the England cricket team and using the English flag and symbol, as well as the attitude of the \"English establishment\", with critics stating that a \"significant section of the Welsh population [...] totally reject the England Cricket team as representative of our country\".\nOpposition.\nCricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club oppose a standalone team separate from the ECB, with Glamorgan arguing for the financial benefits of the Welsh county within the English structure and that a separate team would make \"no sense\" and cause \"serious financial repercussions for the club\", with Cricket Wales stating they are \"committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB\". Glamorgan, however, does hold two of the three votes in the management of Cricket Wales.\nAlan Hamer, chief executive of Glamorgan County Cricket Club, stated they had informed the Welsh Government in 2011 of their opposition. Hamer stated such a move would end England internationals being played in Cardiff, such as the 2015 Ashes series, causing financial difficulties to the club, and that the current arrangement provided a \"far higher\" playing standard than those of tier two ICC nations. Succeeding chief executive Hugh Morris reiterated Glamorgan's opposition in 2018, stating he had seen no business plan, that it lacked any financial sense, and would cause the club to lose their stadium, players and make growing the game in Wales \"more challenging\" as the club was \"very much wedded\" to the ECB. Morris also stated a Glamorgan team and a Wales national team could not co-exist, with potential ICC Wales and Glamorgan matches clashing.\nMike Hedges, Labour AM, expressed his opposition to the idea in 2013, arguing that separation from the ECB would require Wales to \"set up its own board under the ICC\", causing Glamorgan to leave the County Championship, including any \"shared-out revenue\" with Sky, and the halting of test matches at the Swalec Stadium in Cardiff. Hedges also argued that the ECB has more money than the ICC can provide, that \"Glamorgan is already effectively an all-Wales team\", as it also plays in Abergavenny, Colwyn Bay and Llanelli (all not in Glamorgan county), and that the Ireland and Scotland teams are actually \"feeder teams\" for the England team. Eoin Morgan is given as an example of an Irishman playing for England.\nPeter Black, Liberal Democrat AM, stated in 2013 that it would be \"decades for Wales to be playing cricket with the top teams\" and having Glamorgan in the County Championship delivered \"great matches over the years\". Black compared those supporting a separate Welsh cricket team to those aspiring for Welsh independence from the United Kingdom.\nThe Welsh Government and Cardiff Council have argued that participating in the ECB provides Cardiff, when it hosts England cricket matches, with an opportunity to build its reputation as a sporting hub.\nDecision.\nThe ECB expressed their open-mindedness to the issue. In the event of such a scenario, Wales would need to apply for associate membership of the ICC, separate from the ECB, and meet international standards for competitions and venues, but the ECB stated that there is little reason for Wales to not meet such criteria. The ECB stated they support \"the democratic decision and preferences expressed by cricketers in Wales\". Sophia Gardens in Cardiff would have to forgo England's Test host status, however between 2020 and 2024, Glamorgan were compensated £2.5 million from the ECB, in return for not hosting any Test matches at the cricket ground between those years.\nAssembly Members (now Senedd Members) unanimously agreed in 2013, that the decision of whether Wales should compete as a separate team to the England cricket team would be decided by the cricket sporting bodies themselves. Welsh Minister for Culture and Sport, John Griffiths, stated in 2013, that whether there is a Welsh cricket team, it \"is largely [the] matter for the relevant cricketing authority\".\nNotable Welsh cricketers.\nThe following Welsh cricketers have played Test cricket for England:\nAlan Jones played a match for England against Rest of the World in 1970 which was later stripped of Test status. He holds the record for most runs in first-class cricket without playing a Test match. In 2020, he was awarded an England Test cap."

        "title": "Ken Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Kenneth Roy Williams (June 28, 1890 – January 22, 1959) was an American professional baseball player. He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1915 to 1929. Williams began his major league career with the Cincinnati Reds before spending the majority of his playing days with the St. Louis Browns, and ended his career playing for the Boston Red Sox. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In 1922, Williams became the first player in MLB history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season.\nProfessional baseball career.\nWilliams began his professional baseball career in at the age of 23, playing for the Regina Red Sox of the Western Canada League. In , he played for the Edmonton Eskimos before moving to the Spokane Indians in . After posting a .340 batting average in 79 games for the Indians, he made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on July 14, 1915. He hit for a .242 average in 71 games for the Reds during the peak of the dead-ball era when only 6 players in the league hit above the .300 mark. He played in only 10 games for the Reds in 1916, spending most of the season with Spokane and with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. Williams hit 24 home runs along with a .313 batting average for Portland in before being purchased by the St. Louis Browns.\nWilliams was drafted into the United States Army in April 1918, and appeared in only two games for the Browns that season. He returned to the Browns in 1919 and hit .300 with 6 home runs in 65 games. In , Major League Baseball outlawed specialty pitches such as the spitball and experienced a subsequent jump in the league batting averages as well as home runs. In Williams' first full season as a regular player in 1920, he posted a .307 batting average along with 10 home runs and 72 runs batted in. He continued to improve in 1921 with a .347 batting average with 24 home runs, 117 runs batted in and a career-high .429 on-base percentage.\nWilliams had the best season of his career in 1922, leading the American League with 39 home runs and 155 runs batted in, as the Browns finished the season one game behind the pennant-winning New York Yankees. 32 of his 39 home runs were hit at home in Sportsman's Park. On April 22, Williams hit 3 home runs with 6 RBI against the Chicago White Sox in a 10-7 victory at Sportsman's Park. On August 7, 1922, during a game against the Washington Senators, he became the first player in American League history to hit two home runs in one inning. His 39 home runs topped Babe Ruth, who had led the league the previous four seasons, although Ruth had been suspended well into the 1922 season by Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for violating a curb on barnstorming. Williams was one of only two players to break Babe Ruth's twelve-year string in which he led the American League in home runs (the other being Bob Meusel). Also in 1922, Williams also became the first player in major league history to have 30 home runs and 30-plus stolen bases in the same season; a feat which would not be achieved again until Willie Mays accomplished it with the New York Giants in .\nIn August 1923, the Washington Senators came into possession of one of Williams' bats and discovered that it had been bored out and plugged with a lighter wood. The bat was turned over to National League umpire George Hildebrand for investigation and the Senators protested all the victories by the Browns in which Williams had used the bat. Williams explained that he had ordered the bat specially made, but when he received it, he found it to be too heavy, so he plugged it with a lighter wood. He was cited in the 1924 \"Reach Guide\" for using a corked bat, although major league baseball hadn't ruled plugged bats illegal at the time. He finished the 1923 season with a career-high .357 batting average along with 29 home runs and 91 runs batted in and ended the season 15th in Most Valuable Player Award balloting.\nIn November 1924, it was rumored that the Yankees were trying to trade for Williams, which would have teamed him with Ruth to make one of the most powerful home run combinations in baseball. However, St. Louis manager George Sisler's insistence on the Yankees trading Waite Hoyt for Williams was too high a price for Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert.\nWilliams had another productive season in 1925, hitting .331 with 25 home runs and 105 runs batted in, and led the league with a .613 slugging percentage. Williams continued to hit well for the remainder of his career with St. Louis until December 15, 1927, when he was purchased by the Boston Red Sox for $10,000. He played two more seasons for the Red Sox, hitting for a .345 average in 1929 at the age of 39. Williams returned to the minor leagues in to play two more seasons for the Portland Beavers before retiring in at the age of 41.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Williams played in 1,397 games, accumulating 1,552 hits in 4,862 at bats for a .319 career batting average along with 196 home runs, 916 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .393. Of his 196 home runs, 142 came at his home park. He retired with a .958 fielding percentage. As baseball evolved out of the dead-ball era, Williams finished in the top four in the American League in home runs in seven consecutive seasons (1921–1927). He posted ten seasons with a batting average above .300, and three seasons in which he scored more than 100 runs. As of , Williams' .319 career batting average ranked 53rd all-time in major league history. His .924 career on-base plus slugging percentage and his .530 career slugging percentage ranked 45th and 48th respectively all-time among major league players. Williams holds the St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles single season record for runs batted in with 155 in . He is the St. Louis Browns' all-time leader in on-base percentage (.403), slugging percentage (.558) and OPS (.961). In the 2001 book \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", Bill James ranked Williams as the 50th greatest left fielder of all-time.\nPost-baseball.\nWilliams returned to Grants Pass and worked as a police officer before becoming owner and operator of the Owl Club, a restaurant and billiard parlor on G Street."

        "title": "Birmingham Moseley Rugby",
        "text": "Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club is an English rugby union club, based in Birmingham, that compete in the third tier of English rugby. They were historically the premier rugby club in Birmingham, reaching the final of the John Player Cup three times in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They originally played at the Reddings, but after attempting to keep up with the transition to professional rugby, the club ran into financial difficulties and were forced to sell their 125-year home to property developers. An unsuccessful five-year spell based at the University of Birmingham followed, during which time they were relegated to National Division Two. In 2005 the club moved to its new home at Billesley Common, and were promoted to National Division One in 2006. In 2009 they won their first cup in 27 years beating Leeds 23–18 in the final of the National Trophy at Twickenham. On the weekend starting 15 April 2016; defeat to Bristol, combined with results elsewhere during the same weekend, confirmed Moseley's relegation to National League 1 for the 2016–17 season.\nPrior to the 2016–17 season, the club changed its name to Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nEarly days.\nMoseley was founded in 1873 by members of Havelock Cricket Club who wanted a winter sport when the cricket season had finished. The club debuted its signature red and black colours one year later. The Reddings was leased by the club in 1880 and the club was traditionally called, like many rugby football clubs from either code, simply \"Moseley Football Club\" (a signpost from Alcester Road along Reddings Road in Moseley, erected by Birmingham City Council, pointed to \"Moseley F.C. (R.U.)\". This sign has now been re-erected by the main entrance to the club grounds on Yardley Wood Road.)\nThere were major successes for Moseley in the early days of rugby, including a three-year undefeated run from 1879 to 1882, which included winning the first Midland Counties Challenge Cup. In total they won the cup nine times and finished runner-up eleven times.\nIn 1882 Moseley became the first team to defeat the travelling New Zealand Native football team. In front of 5000 supporters they beat the tourists 6-4 much to the surprise of the New Zealanders. In 1890 John Rogers was the first Moseley player to win an international cap while at the club.\n1900 Paris Olympics.\nMoseley formed the backbone of the team which represented Great Britain at the 1900 Paris Olympics winning a Silver medal. The team, known as Moseley Wanderers, played one game, a 27–8 defeat to France at the Velodrome Municipal at Vincennes. A report in \"The Times\" suggested that fatigue was largely to blame, and at least five of the players are believed to have played for their respective clubs, in England, the day before the game.\nThe golden years.\nThe club acquired the freehold of The Reddings in 1925 and in 1935 the ground even staged an England trial game. Floodlights were installed in 1965 which allowed for an expanded fixture list and began Moseley's so-called 'The Golden Years'. From this time onwards Moseley's fixture list routinely included the top sides in England and Wales, and Moseley players were regularly included in international teams. The most successful years were the late 1960s and 1970s, this included reaching the RFU Knock-out cup final on three occasions – losing 17–6 to Gloucester and then 15–12 to Leicester before emerging joint winners drawing 12–12 with Gloucester after extra time in 1982. The team also defeated Fiji and the Barbarians.\nWhen league rugby commenced in 1987, the team was placed in the Courage National Division 1, the top division at the time. They ended Bath's astonishing run of 22 unbeaten cup matches in 1988, winning 4–3.\nProfessional era.\nBuilding for the future.\nThe team's relegation from the top division at the end of the 1990–1991 season marked a consolidation period for the club after their fantastic times of the 1970s. In August 1995, when the door to full-scale professionalism opened, the board executives came together to work on plans to move with the idea and find possible financial resources so that the team could play with the best team and best facilities.\nAdministration – leaving the Reddings.\nOn 30 January 1998, the club went into administration, after overstretching its financial resources in the early years of professional rugby union. The Reddings had been sold on a 'delayed sale' basis to Bryant Homes and the future of the club was in jeopardy. However, the club's playing commitments were still fulfilled except in the North Midlands Cup in which the 2nd XV was entered. On 12 June 1998, the club was given another chance to fashion its own destiny when a group of Moseley Rugby Club members, assembled by Simon Cooper, a former club player and official, formed Moseley Ventures Ltd and bought the club out of administration. In the last 1st XV match at The Reddings on 6 May 2000, Moseley defeated Worcester 34–17 in a National Division One game.\nThe Bournbrook Era – crisis and final rescue.\nOn 7 October Moseley defeated Exeter 27–18 in the first match at its new home at the University of Birmingham in Bournbrook. However long-term permissions for a clubhouse and hospitality boxes were not granted and in consequence Moseley Ventures found it more difficult than expected to raise the necessary finance. Merger plans were discussed and an offer was made by Firoz Kassam, the chairman of Oxford United Football Club with a proposal to buy out the club and take it to his new stadium in Oxford. Supporters organized a major media and political campaign and this became the catalyst for a consortium of Moseley stalwarts to come forward to raise finance to defeat the Kassam offer. At a predictably traumatic meeting at the Grand Hotel on 26 July 2002, the consortium gained the support of the creditors by a narrow 1.7% majority regarded by some as a Pyrrhic victory. However, the consortium's business plan was approved by the RFU and with additional backing by the politicians of the City of Birmingham and the North Midlands RFU, the club survived in Birmingham. So a new Moseley Rugby Club was born and appointed David Warren as Chief Executive and former players John Beale and Derek Nutt as Director of Rugby and Head Coach respectively. Negotiations for planning permission for a new stadium at Billesley Common, in the same postal district as The Reddings, began and permission was obtained.\nHowever, despite the success of the consortium in keeping the club in Birmingham a large number of first-team regulars had left the club at the end of the 2001–02 season. The team hastily assembled from more junior ranks after the rescue was inevitably relegated from National Division One (after 14 seasons in the top two divisions). After a difficult first few months in National Division Two the team began to gel, and a decent run of results in the new year saw mid-table respectability achieved for the 2003–04 season.\nFurther improvement during the 2004–05 season saw Moseley finishing third in the table, narrowly missing promotion behind Doncaster and Newbury. Nonetheless, the season saw many club records broken, and the era of lodging at Birmingham University ended with much optimism for the future.\nThe records broken were:\nRecent seasons.\n2005–06 season.\nThe first season at the new stadium on Billesley Common saw Moseley installed as favourites to gain promotion to higher echelons of the English game. Coaches Ian Smith and Don Caskie, along with Director of Rugby John Beale assembled an exceptionally strong team, now including ex-Premiership players Neil Mason and Daren O'Leary. Moseley topped the table for much of the season and indeed finished as champions ahead of Waterloo. Both teams gained promotion to National Division One.\n2006–07 season.\nAfter the euphoria of promotion, the new season was much more difficult for the club. Most of the promotion-winning squad was retained, and with some additions the team showed promise in the early games, including a defeat of highly fancied Bedford. However, a string of defeats up to Christmas against top teams, with even bonus points being hard to come by, left Moseley facing a difficult task to survive. A brief rally in December and January, including a win against traditional \"best enemies\" Coventry proved vital in the long run, and towards the end of the season, with Waterloo already doomed, Otley flagged badly enough for Moseley to overhaul them and win a second season in National One.\n2007–08 season.\nFor this season, a highly imaginative agreement was made with Gloucester whereby all of Gloucester's England Academy players were dual-registered with Moseley, enabling them to get competitive match experience when not required by the Gloucester 1st XV. The club finished the season in an improved 10th place with 12 wins and a draw, beating every side from 7th downwards either home or away. Two victories against top six sides included Nottingham (3rd) away and Cornish Pirates (5th) at home. A lack of bonus points meant that while they had the same playing record (W12 D1) they finished 6 points adrift of 8th placed Plymouth.\n2008–09 season.\nThe season commenced with the dual-registration agreement with Gloucester still in place, although refined in detail, and the bulk of the previous season's squad retained with some judicious recruitment in particular positions. Together with the heavily criticised plan to reduce National Division One from 16 to 12 teams and a fixture backlog caused by a number cancellations, the team hovered just above and around the relegation zone for most of the season. Despite facing the threat of relegation they won the National Trophy beating National Division One runners up Exeter Chiefs in the semi-final and the division winners Leeds Carnegie in the final. A final league position of eighth represented continued upward progress over a period of five seasons.\n2009–10 season.\nDespite having their moments, most notably a final day 30-25 victory over Bristol, Moseley did not perform on a consistent enough basis and despite finishing only two points behind 8th place, were lucky not to be relegated after a poor performance in the relegation play-off. After an early season defeat to Exeter Chiefs, who would later earn promotion, Moseley managed victories away to local rivals Birmingham and Solihull and Coventry; however they lost at home to Nottingham and London Welsh to late tries, a regular occurrence that would cost them later in the season. Moseley never threatened to be anything other than mid-table, however they had hopes of at least finishing in the top 8, but even their heroic last day performance was not enough to reach the promotion play-offs.\nAn away defeat to Birmingham and Solihull and a home loss against Rotherham meant that Moseley were in grave danger of relegation. A scrappy game at Butts Park Arena resulted in a narrow 6–3 loss, but a spirited away victory over Rotherham and a nervy win against Coventry at Billesley Common by a score were enough to guarantee another season in the second tier. A terrible defensive display led to another defeat to Birmingham and Solihull, but fortunately it did not matter. However at the end of the season Moseley lost Aly Muldowney, who was the current Supporters' Player of the Season, to Glasgow Warriors, former Supporters' Player of the Season and England Sevens International James Rodwell, top points scorer Tristan Roberts to Championship rivals Doncaster, and released a number of players including the disappointing Justin Mensah-Coker.\nFacilities.\nSince 2005 Moseley have played at Billesley Common, which is owned by Birmingham City Council, and they now have a long term lease on an area to the north of the site where the club's facilities and 1st XV pitch are located. These temporary facilities include a clubhouse and changing facilities, a covered stand, club shop, and hospitality boxes. The pitch is extremely highly rated for its playing surface, although it gently slopes to the north-east. There are also outer pitches on the common for the 2nd/development XV, colts, women, minis and juniors as well as an all-weather pitch featuring the latest rubber-crumb technology which the club manages.\nPlans for the replacement of the temporary facilities at Billesley with permanent buildings were first exhibited to the general public in 2007. In the autumn of 2009 plans were formally submitted to Birmingham City Council for the construction of a 5000-seat stand along the east side of the pitch, allowing the overall capacity to be expanded to 7500. Planning approval was granted by councillors on 21 January 2010. However, with finance for the construction of this stand proving difficult to obtain in a difficult economic climate, an alternative plan for a more modest construction was progressed, in the form of a stand with 750 seats on the west side of the pitch, containing player facilities, bars and function room. This opened in April 2015. The south Birmingham indoor bowls centre was constructed at the same time and backs onto this stand. With the relocation of the 650-seat temporary stand to the east side of the ground, this now gives seated capacity of 1,300.\nSupporters.\nThe Moseley Supporters Association was originally established as 'The Members Committee' in 1986. When Moseley left the Reddings in 2000, like the club the Association struggled to maintain its support and it was disbanded in 2001. However the Association was reformed in 2010, organising social events and competitions at home matches and running coaches to away games. The Association also organise annual Supporters Player of the Season, with the winner receiving the Lionel Moriaty Memorial Boot.\nRivalries.\nMoseley's historic local rivals are Coventry. Prior to the commencement of league the two clubs would play each other annually on Boxing Day for the 'Moseley Trophy' and on one occasion in 1972 the starting line up at the fixture included 16 internationals. Since league rugby began the clubs are only able to \nkeep up this tradition when in the same league, although the friendly rivalry between the fans remains. When playing Northampton the two clubs play for 'The Teddy Brookes Trophy' although they have rarely been in the same league in recent years.\nMore recently there has been less friendly rivalries with Birmingham &amp; Solihull and Worcester Warriors. However, since Moseley's relegation to National League 1 the rivalry between Moseley and Coventry has returned.\nHonours.\nFemale team.\nThe women’s team was founded in 2000 and have been progressing ever since.

His life was honoured in a special match between an International XV and Moseley, played to a packed Reddings. When Moseley moved to their new ground at nearby Billesley Common in 2005, 28 years later, many suggested that it should be called the Sam Doble Stadium."

Schölvinck as a subsidiary organization of \"The Corps\", an Amsterdam student fraternity. \nWithin a short period of time, Nereus started proving itself by achieving big successes and winning its first event in 1888 followed by a winning streak of four Varsity victories 1891–1894. After obtaining national recognition, Nereus finally made its mark on the international rowing scene by winning at Hamburg in 1891 and by winning the Thames Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1895. \nNereus has provided rowers for the Netherlands' national Olympic crews, of which the golden men's eight in Atlanta (1996), the silver quad in Sydney (2000), the silver men's eight, bronze lightweight women's double and women's eight in Athens (2004) are examples. At the Beijing Olympics (2008), as well as the Rio de Janeiro Olympics (2016), Nereus lightweight women's double won the gold medal. One of the more notable members of Nereus is head coach Diederik Simon who has won two silver medals at the 2000 Sydney games and 2004 Athens games. Simon's most prestigious achievements come from his 1996 Gold in the men's eight at the 1996 Atlanta games, and his wins in the Oude Vier or Old four at the Varsity (rowing regatta). Other Notable members include Tone Wieten who currently holds the RowPerfect 2-kilometre world record with a time of five minutes and thirty-three seconds, Robert Lücken, and Boaz Meylink.\nNereus has won the most prestigious and oldest student rowing event of The Netherlands, The Varsity, which is modelled after the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, a total of 43 times. \nThe club's first boathouse was built in 1886 along the River Amstel. It was situated closer to the centre of Amsterdam than the present one. The old boathouse was demolished during the Second World War. The current boathouse was opened in 1953. A miniature version of the Nereus boathouse can be found in Madurodam.\nMembership of Nereus was originally confined to members of The Amsterdam Student Corps, also the ‘Corps’. Changes in Dutch society in the 1970s and decreasing membership levels caused Nereus to welcome non-Corps members as well as merging with its female counterpart Thetis.\nNereus celebrated its 26th lustrum on its 130th dies natalis on December 11, 2015."

        "text": "The 1937 South Africa tour to Australasia was one of the most successful Springbok tours in history, so much so that the touring team was nicknamed the \"Invincibles\". The squad was captained by Philip Nel.\nThe tour started on 26 June 1937 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, Australia with a 9–5 win over the Wallabies. The Springboks followed up the win with an emphatic 26–17 win on 17 July at the same grounds, outscoring the Wallabies 6 tries to 3 and taking the series 2–0.\nWhen the Springboks arrived in New Zealand later that year nobody expected them to win the series, as no other South African team had ever achieved the feat, and when the New Zealand leg of the tour kicked off on 14 August with a 13–7 loss to New Zealand at Athletic Park in Wellington, it seemed business as usual.\nMr Nel and his men had other ideas, adopting a strategy sent to them via telegram from Springbok great Paul Roos: \"skrum, skrum, skrum\". Their dominant pack was the impetus used to deal New Zealand two convincing defeats; a 13–6 win at Lancaster Park in Christchurch and a 17–6 win at Eden Park in Auckland, taking the series 2–1. The latter translates into a 27–6 (5 try to nil) win using today's point system. The hero of the decider was centre Louis Babrow, who scored two critical tries. Babrow nearly did not feature in the last test as he was an observant Jew and the match fell on Yom Kippur; however, he justified playing on a high holy day by saying that the sun had not yet risen in South Africa by the time of kickoff in New Zealand.\nThe 1937 Springbok team remains the only Springbok team ever to have won a series in New Zealand and contained legendary players such as Danie Craven and Boy Louw.\nMatches in Australia.\n\"Scores and results list South Africa's points tally first.\"\nMatches in New Zealand.\n\"Scores and results list South Africa's points tally first.\"\nReferences.\n "

        "text": "A lacrosse ball is the solid rubber ball that is used, with a lacrosse stick, to play the sport of lacrosse. It is typically white for men's lacrosse (however the PLL uses optic yellow balls for better TV visibility), or yellow for women's lacrosse; but the balls are produced in a wide variety of colours.\nThe current World Lacrosse, NCAA, and NFHS approved specifications are:\nBeginning with the 2014 season, all three governing bodies for lacrosse in the United States (US Lacrosse, NFHS, NCAA) have mandated that only balls meeting the NOCSAE ball standard may be used for competition. Balls must be emblazoned with the words \"Meets NOCSAE Standard\" in order to be deemed legal for play by game officials.\nStarting by June 2016, all lacrosse balls have had to meet the new NOCSAE Standard for use in official NCAA and NFHS play. Canadian official games require CLA approvals.\nGreasers.\nA new lacrosse ball will have a textured feel, and feel a little squishy, overtime this ball will become \"greasy\" and harden. A \"greasy\" lacrosse ball (often referred to as a \"greaser\") is a ball that has lost its grip and has hardened; this causes players to throw inaccurately as it no longer grips the mesh in the way a typical, new lacrosse ball would. This occurs naturally in lacrosse balls as the oils come to the surface of the ball.\nHistory.\nPre-1860.\nThe original lacrosse balls were made from wood and egg-shaped, but they would develop to become more round. They were later made from buckskins filled with fur. These were made naturally and was meant to keep the game connected with nature. In Seneca folklore it is said that human heads were used as lacrosse balls.\n1860-Present.\nIn 1860, Dr. William George Beers codified the rules of lacrosse which included requiring the ball to be made with rubber.\nMost modern lacrosse balls are made of vulcanized rubber entirely. At some points some lacrosse balls may have had cement in the middle, but today they are entirely rubber.\nInnovations.\nGreaseless lacrosse ball.\nIn December of 2015, Guardian Innovations released a \"greaseless\" lacrosse ball known as Pearl X. The Pearl ball is made from a \"cross-linked polyurethane formula\" which doesn't contain the oils found in a typical lacrosse ball. \nOther greaseless lacrosse balls have been created by brands such as East Coast Dyes, which released the ECD Mint.\nOn July 27, 2016, US Lacrosse named The Pearl by Guardian the official ball of US Lacrosse and it would be used at all US Lacrosse events. This partnership was renewed for the second time in 2021. It is also the official ball, the U.S. National Teams, the MCLA, and the IMCLA.\nTextured lacrosse ball.\nIn March of 2019, Guardian Innovations released the first textured lacrosse ball approved for play, the \"Pearl LT.\" The textured ball offers better feel in the pocket of the stick, which increases control and consistency. Unlike Guardian Innovations Pearl X, the Pearl LT is made of rubber, and like other rubber balls, will grease. However, the textured surface of the ball will remain.\nSmart lacrosse ball.\nOn January 14, 2022 at the US Lacrosse Convention, REPS Lacrosse revealed the first \"Smart\" Lacrosse Ball dubbed the \"R1 by REPS\". The ball comes equipped with a patented embedded suite of sensors which tie into the REPS Lacrosse App. \nManufacturers.\nWolf Athletics is the official ball supplier of the Premier Lacrosse League.\nAs of August 2023, the following ball brands meet NOCSAE standards and are SEI certified:\nReferences.\nhttps://www.nfhs.org/media/3812049/2020-sei-user-notice-sl-17.pdf"

        "title": "Blocking (American football)",
        "text": "In American football, blocking or interference (or running interference) involves legal movements in which one player uses his body to obstruct another player's path. The purpose of blocking is to prevent defensive players from tackling the ball carrier, or to protect a quarterback who is attempting to pass, hand off or run the ball. Offensive linemen and fullbacks tend to do the most blocking, although wide receivers are often asked to help block on running plays and halfbacks may be asked to help block on passing plays, while tight ends perform pass blocking and run blocking if they are not running routes to receive passes. Overall, blocking is a skill that virtually every football player may be required to do at some point, even defensive players in the event of a turnover.\nEssentially, blocking is pushing, with certain restrictions; in blocking one may not grasp another player or do any sort of pulling, and the hands must not extend beyond the line of each armpit; otherwise a holding penalty will be assessed. Blocking is also not permitted beyond five yards from the line of scrimmage until the quarterback has handed off the ball to a runner or a receiver has touched the ball after it has been passed.\nOutside sports, \"running interference\" is a metaphor that refers to a person's helping someone in the performance of a task without directly assisting in the task. Often this is done by attracting attention to oneself (so as to deflect attention from the other person) or throwing oneself into harm's way.\nTypes.\nZone blocking scheme.\nZone blocking is a technique that is a simple and effective scheme for creating lanes for running plays. In a zone blocking scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive linemen. Coordination and technique matter more than muscle in implementing a successful scheme because defensive linemen are often double-teamed at the point of attack. In this blocking scheme, which takes much from the Veer blocking system, creating movement on the defensive line is more important than opening a specific hole in the defense.\nTeam support in zone blocking.\nOne of the simplest reasons many teams have incorporated zone blocking in their offenses is that zone blocking rules do not change based on the defensive front. In a \"man block\" system, blockers are paired with defenders according to certain rules to create a running lane. If the defensive front changes, or if the defense stunts or blitzes, the blocking rules may change. This requires learning multiple rules for the same play. Zone blocking uses very consistent rules that do not change according to the defensive front.\nSome teams base their entire offense on it, including the NFL's Washington Commanders, New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, and Los Angeles Rams. Adopting a variation of this scheme's core principles, the West Virginia Mountaineers rely on it in the run-based spread offense, devised by former head coach Rich Rodriguez and former offensive line coach Rick Trickett, that they have used even after their departure. The University of Iowa under head coach Kirk Ferentz, a former NFL offensive line coach, utilizes zone blocking and the inside/outside stretch play as the basis for their offense. The University of Michigan also started using zone blocking under head coach Lloyd Carr in the 2006 season, and continued to do so under his successor, Rich Rodriguez.\nThe Carolina Panthers made the switch to zone blocking under offensive coordinator Jeff Davidson for the 2007 season. They had previously employed a man-blocking scheme for a downhill running attack under coordinator Dan Henning, but during the 2006 season, the team's undersized linemen were consistently overpowered by opposing defensive linemen. The power running game became stagnant, and especially ineffective in goal-line/short yardage situations, thus resulting in Henning's firing and the switch to zone blocking. Thanks in part to the new blocking scheme they implemented, the Panthers saw their 2008 campaign characterized by the running of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart to great effect, gaining them play off status. That season also saw the emergence of rookie Steve Slaton with the Houston Texans under their new Alex Gibbs-designed zone blocking scheme.\nLinemen techniques in zone blocking.\nUsing a running back out of the backfield, zone plays are usually categorized into three types: Inside Zone (IZ), Outside Zone (OZ) and Stretch. These types describe the initial landmark of the ball carrier. A common approach is: Inside the tackles for IZ, just outside the tackle for OZ and just inside the last offensive player for the stretch.\nFor each type of zone there are many different blocking schemes available:\nToday every NFL team uses some form of zone blocking but not all of them rely on it entirely.\nCut blocking controversies.\nThe linemen of some teams that use zone blocking schemes have been criticized for their alleged penchant for cut blocking the knees of defenders, sometimes away from the play. Cut blocks are legal unless a defensive player is engaged by another offensive player. Although some consider the technique unsportsmanlike because of the risk of serious injury, when taught and applied correctly it is a very effective tactic. In fact, some defensive players employ the technique to eliminate blockers so other defenders can make the tackle.\nSophisticated schemes.\nZone blocking schemes frequently employ deception. For example, plays may be called in which blitzing defensive linemen and linebackers are permitted to rush into areas of the offensive backfield that are unimportant in the play called by the offense. Meanwhile, the offensive linemen who vacated the unimportant area migrate to the point of attack, blocking material defensive players.\nRole of other players.\nPlayers other than offensive linemen may enhance the success of a zone blocking scheme. For example, in a run-based spread attack like West Virginia's the primary responsibility of receivers is less to catch passes than to execute downfield blocks, springing the ball carrier and extending the run.\nHistory.\nInterference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes, where it is known as \"obstruction\". The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its offside rule, which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal. At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner. Interference developed out of a practice called \"guarding\"; run by Princeton, wherein a player ran at each side of the runner, but not in advance.\nWhen Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed during a game he refereed between Harvard and Princeton in 1879, he was at first appalled, but the next year he had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team at Yale. During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the Flying wedge or \"V-trick formation\", which was first employed by Richard Hodge at Princeton in 1884 in a game against Penn, however, Princeton put the tactic aside for the next 4 years, only to revive it again in 1888 to combat the three-time All-American Yale guard Pudge Heffelfinger. Heffelfinger soon figured out how to break up the formation by leaping high in the air with his legs tucked under him, striking the V like a human cannonball.\nIn 1892, during a game against Yale, Harvard fan and student Lorin F. Deland first introduced the flying wedge as a kickoff play. Two five man squads would line up about 25 yards behind the kicker, only to converge in a perfect flying wedge running downfield, where Harvard was able to trap the ball and hand it off to the speedy All-American Charley Brewer inside the wedge. Despite their effectiveness, the flying wedge, \"V-trick formation\" and other tactics which involved interlocking interference, were outlawed in 1905 through the efforts of the rule committee led by Parke H. Davis, because of its contribution to serious injury. Non-interlocking interference remains a basic element of modern American football, with many complex schemes being developed and implemented over the years, including zone blocking and pass blocking.\nThe current body block technique has been attributed to one of football history's greatest head coaches: Pop Warner. Prior to his early 1900s coaching at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, blocking was done using one's shoulders. It was Warner who implemented the technique of blocking being done by hands rather than shoulders."

        "text": "Tennis in Argentina is regulated by the \"Asociación Argentina de Tenis\" (Argentine Tennis Association), which also selects the coaches of the Argentine teams for the Davis Cup and Federation Cup. There are many tennis courts in Argentina, and the sport, even though still considered middle- to upper-class, is practiced by regardless of age.\nHistory.\nAlthough British immigrants brought the sport to Argentina, it was not until late in the 1970s that Guillermo Vilas' success made the sport popular, reaching second place in the 1975 ATP ranking. He was internationally recognised and was later included in the International Tennis Hall of Fame. During the 1980s, José Luis Clerc (4th), Alberto Mancini (8th) and Martín Jaite (10th) followed Vilas and kept interest in the sport alive. Argentina won the 1980 World Team Cup beating Italy 3–0, and reached the final of the 1980 Davis Cup, losing to United States 3–1. In the 1990s it was Gabriela Sabatini who best represented Argentine tennis, becoming an international figure on and off the court.\nThe boom of Argentine tennis players came in the 2000s, when many players became important in the circuit reaching high ranks. Paola Suárez won eight Grand Slam doubles between 2001 and 2005 and was, together with Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual, the top women's couple for three years in a row. In 2002, José Acasuso, Guillermo Cañas, Lucas Arnold and Gastón Etlis won again the World Team Cup for Argentina, this time 3–0 against Russia. Five years later, Acasuso, Juan Ignacio Chela, Agustín Calleri and Sebastián Prieto won it again, this time 2–1 against the Czech Republic. David Nalbandian lost in the final of Wimbledon in 2002. The 2004 French Open saw an Argentine final between Gastón Gaudio and Guillermo Coria. The following year's French Open saw Mariano Puerta reach the final.\nAnother example of the importance of the Argentine presence on the circuit was the August 2005 male rankings that counted five Argentine players among the top 12 (from 8th to 12th) of the ATP ranking, and three in the top ten of the Champions Race (5th, 8th and 9th). The 2005 Tennis Masters Cup, due to a series of last-minute resignations, had 4 Argentine players of the total of 8, with Gaudio reaching semi-finals, and Nalbandian winning the competition against #1 Roger Federer.\nIn 2009 Juan Martín del Potro became the first Argentinian to win the US Open since Guillermo Vilas did in 1977. Del Potro defeated world number 2 Rafael Nadal in straight sets in semifinals to reach the final and eventually beat world number 1 Roger Federer in five sets. That year Del Potro reached the final of the ATP World Tour Championship. In 2016, the Argentine Copa Davis team were crowned world champions. Juan Martín del Potro, Federico Delbonis, Leonardo Mayer and Guido Pella earned the country their first title in the sport's most important inter-country competition.\nBest results at major tournaments.\nAs of the 2020 French Open."

The dual-slalom format – which involved knock-out heats with two riders on the parallel courses in each heat – evolved into four-cross (with four riders on a single course per heat) in 2002 before being dropped after the 2011 season. Riders win points according to their placing in each event. The reigning series leaders in each class are identified by a special jersey. The UCI Mountain Bike World Cup is broadcast live and globally on Red Bull TV.\nThe replacement world series for 4X World Cup is the 4X Pro Tour and for XCM World Cup is UCI MTB Marathon series."

In the following season, Sun improved his numbers, making the All-ABA first team with 13.5 points per game and six rebounds per game with 10.5 assists per game. \nLos Angeles Lakers (2008–2009).\nAfter originally entering the 2006 NBA draft but subsequently withdrawing, Sun decided to enter the 2007 NBA draft and was taken by the Los Angeles Lakers as the 40th overall pick. With Sun being drafted alongside Yi Jianlian that year, it marked the first time in NBA draft history that two China-born players were drafted in the same year. That feat would not be repeated until 2016. It would also be the first time in modern NBA history that a Chinese basketball player would be drafted outside of the CBA. However, Sun stayed with the Beijing Olympians for another year before signing with Los Angeles in August 2008.\nOnly a few days after his arrival in the United States, Sun suffered from a bout with mononucleosis and had to be hospitalized. After recovering from his illness, Sun finally made his debut on 7 December 2008 against the Milwaukee Bucks, scoring four points in five minutes of play.\nSun played in a total of ten regular season games and averaged 2.8 minutes and 0.6 points per game before being assigned to the Lakers' D-League affiliate, the Los Angeles D-Fenders. He played six games with the team, averaging 0.7 points and 0.2 assists per game. Sun then suffered a left ankle sprain during practice with the D-Fenders and missed the remaining D-League games.\nSun eventually recovered and traveled with the Lakers as a member of their playoff roster, but he was not activated. Since he was a member of the team when the Lakers ultimately won their championship, he did receive a ring and was crowned as an NBA champion. He is the first ethnic Chinese player to win an NBA championship. Following the death of Kobe Bryant in 2020, Sun posted a tribute to Bryant on his Weibo account, writing: \"After I came to the Lakers, I was lucky to be your teammate. This is the dream of many people.\"\nSun was waived by Los Angeles on 31 July 2009. \nReturn to the Olympians (2009–2013).\nSun joined the New York Knicks, but was waived on 7 October 2009, before the next season started, due to a stress fracture in his knee. He did not play for two seasons until returning to the CBA in the 2013–14 season, where he yet again played for the Beijing Olympians.\nBeijing Ducks (2013–2017).\nAfter playing several more seasons with the Beijing Olympians (remaining with the club until its eventual disbanding in 2013), Sun then signed with the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association in 2013. He played a vital role in helping Beijing win their second CBA championship title during the 2013-14 season. Not only that, but he also provided a useful role in helping Beijing repeat as champions a year later.\nBeijing Royal Fighters (2019–2021).\nSun joined the Beijing Royal Fighters in 2019. In October 2021, he retired at age 35.\nNational team career.\nSun competed in the NBA Summer League with the Chinese national basketball team in the summer of 2007. This was seen as a chance for the Chinese national team to gain further experience against international competition in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which Sun would also compete in. He also participated in the 2007 Stanković Continental Champions' Cup and played a vital role in the wins against Venezuela and New Zealand. Sun earned a silver medal in the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship after China finished as runners-up in the tournament. He earned a gold medal in the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship as his side won against Jordan.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to Chinese media Baidu Sports, Sun presented his NBA championship ring to his girlfriend Chen Lu when he proposed. According to the Chinese model, Sun \"sees the ring as his highest honour and most prized possession\".\nLegacy.\nSun is one of only two players to become a champion of both the NBA and the CBA; the other player to accomplish such a feat is Eric Moreland."

        "title": "Zimbabwe national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Zimbabwe national rugby union team, nicknamed the Sables, represents the Zimbabwe Rugby Union in international competition. While sides representing the colony of Rhodesia have played as early as 1910, the modern day Zimbabwe rugby team did not play its first test until 1981, against Kenya. Zimbabwe has competed in two World Cups, in 1987 and 1991, in place of South Africa, who were sanctioned by the IRB at the time due to apartheid. Zimbabwe is categorized as Tier 3 Development One, which prioritizes Zimbabwe over other nations due to historical success as well as popularity of rugby in the nation.\nDuring the colonial days, the team had an association with touring British Isles teams, who regularly played matches against them in their tours of South Africa; the earliest tour being in 1910 when Zimbabwe was known as Southern Rhodesia. The side has also played New Zealand on several occasions, the first being in the late 1920s; Zimbabwe is the only non-Tier 1 nation to defeat the All Blacks, as the Southern Rhodesia side defeated New Zealand in 1947.\nZimbabwe currently compete in the Africa Gold Cup, considered the equivalent of the Six Nations in Africa. Zimbabwe have won the competition once, in 2012 Africa Cup, and finished runners up in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Excluding the Springboks, Zimbabwe is one of only 3 nations in Africa to qualify for the Rugby World Cup, the others being Namibia and the Ivory Coast. The Sables maintain fierce rivalries with regional neighbors Namibia and Kenya, as the respective three nations have vied for African supremacy since the 2000s.\nHistory.\nPre-internationals (1890–1910).\nWhen the Pioneer Column arrived in Rhodesia from the Cape Province in 1890, it brought with it the country's first rugby players. The oldest clubs in the country, Queens and the Bulawayo Athletic Club, were formed in 1894 in Bulawayo and the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union was founded one year later in 1895.\nThe first tour by a Rhodesian team to South Africa took place in 1898, and was composed of players from the five biggest clubs in the two major settlements of Bulawayo and Salisbury, today known as Harare.\nSouthern Rhodesia/Rhodesia era (1910–1979).\nA British Lions team played a side called Southern Rhodesia on 30 July 1910 in Bulawayo; the British Isles team defeated Southern Rhodesia. In 1924 a British side played another match against Rhodesia, on 24 July in Salisbury, the British won 24 to 11. With this, this was the first formal national side to represent the country. On 14 July 1928, Rhodesia played in Bulawayo against New Zealand, losing 8 to 44.\nDuring their 1938 tour to South Africa, the British Lions played two matches against Rhodesia. The first, taking place on 20 July saw the British win 25 to 11; three days later the British won again, 45 to 11; these matches were played in Salisbury and Bulawayo. The 1949 Rhodesian Rugby team, led by John Morkel, famously beat a touring All Blacks side led by Fred Allen in Bulawayo 10-8 on 27 July 1949. Three days later they drew with the mighty All Blacks in Salisbury 3-3. Allen had infamously told his team that, no matter the circumstance, the team would \"not\" complain about touring conditions, as he felt whinging would not change the result on the pitch. In spite of this pact, the team encountered a number of issues which were not voiced properly, including the traveling ship being too small, long travel routes, Māori players being left behind due to racial codes, issues with coaching and not acclimating properly to the heat and conditions.\nIn 1960, New Zealand returned to play a match on 2 July at Glamis Park, with Rhodesia losing 14 to 29, though gave the All Blacks a scare yet again, with the game being tied 6 all by half time. The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on 26 May. The next tour, in 1962, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6. In 1973 Rhodesia played a one-off match against Italy, winning 42 to 4. In 1970, Rhodesia played New Zealand for the last time on 27 July, losing 14 to 27. Overall, Rhodesia had played New Zealand 5 times, winning once and drawing once. In 1974, the Lions were back at Salisbury where they defeated Rhodesia 42 to 6. During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of players born in Rhodesia were capped for other international sides, such as Gary Teichmann, David Curtis, and Bobby Skinstad. Rhodesia's rugby playing strength reached its peak in the early to mid-1970s seasons when the country possessed 49 clubs, putting together 102 teams.\nRecord against Tier One nations prior to 1980\nZimbabwe era (1980–present).\n1980s and 1990s - The Golden Generation.\nIn 1980, the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union was renamed the Zimbabwe Rugby Union, reflecting the end of white minority rule in Zimbabwe, and the beginning of the new state. Previously, the Rhodesia side was exclusively all-white, in contrast to the East Africa Tuskers which had been integrated. However, the new Zimbabwe side was instead integrated, including both black and white players. A tour to England was undertaken that year playing six matches, the first against Surrey at Twickenham and one of the others being against Gloucestershire at Kingsholm on 1 October. That same year, the ZRU severed all its ties to the South African Rugby Board due to mounting pressure to boycott the apartheid regime; while Zimbabwe gained international acceptance as a rugby side, they no longer had teams in the Currie Cup and other South African competitions.\nThey played their first international game as Zimbabwe on 7 July 1981 against Kenya, winning 34 to 24. Throughout the 1980s, Zimbabwe played a variety of opponents and enjoyed a decent amount of success, defeating opponents such as Spain and the Soviet Union; in the victory over the Soviet Union, history was made as Richard Tsimba became the first black player for Zimbabwe. In 1987, Zimbabwe was invited to partake in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup to represent the African continent, instead of South Africa, who were under sanction due to apartheid; unfortunately, the Sables lost all 3 of their matches, although came on the verge of upsetting Romania (losing by 1 point), a game which featured a two try performance by Richard Tsimba. The following year in 1988, Zimbabwe became one of the charter members of Rugby Africa, alongside the Ivory Coast, Morocco and Tunisia.\nIn 1990, Zimbabwe participated in the first Rugby World Cup qualifying competition for the African continent. The team topped a group consisting of the Ivory Coast, Morocco, and Tunisia, qualifying for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. However, unfortunately for the Sables, they lost all their 3 matches to Ireland, Japan, and Scotland by fairly large margins. After this World many players from Zimbabwe's \"Golden Generation\" retired. Namibia and later Kenya entered the scene, challenging the original four charter members of Rugby Africa, and the slow deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy in the 1990s and into the 2000s caused many rugby players (both black and white) to leave the country for opportunities elsewhere. An example of this is Kennedy Tsimba, who initially played as a Zimbabwe international, but later switched to South Africa due to the political and economic situation.\nZimbabwe finished last in the round robin for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and finished third in the 1999 qualifying round robin.\n2000s - Decline.\nThe Sables began the decade in poor form, losing all four of their matches in the 2000 Africa Cup, against Namibia and a South African Amateur XV; the team narrowly improved in the following edition in 2001, being able to defeat Namibia once by the score of 27 to 26. In the penultimate 2002 edition, Zimbabwe played a close and tense game against Namibia in Harare, but ultimately lost 30 to 42, failing to qualify for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.\nAs the decade continued, Zimbabwe slowly faded from the African rugby scene; the 2004 campaign was disastrous, as Zimbabwe lost to Madagascar for the first time, and were later thrashed by Namibia. The 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifying campaign was also a disaster, with Zimbabwe losing to Zambia, an opponent they had traditionally dominated. By 2008, the Sables hit rock bottom, losing in the first round of the qualifying for the 2011 World Cup.\n2010s - Revival.\nThe 2010s began with hope for Zimbabwe. The Sables won the Africa Cup for the first time in 2010, beating Botswana and Madagascar. The following year, after a reform of the Africa Cup divisions, Zimbabwe were placed in Group 1B, alongside familiar foes the Ivory Coast and Madagascar and Uganda. Zimbabwe won the division, defeating both Madagascar and Uganda.\nAs with many other sports, over the years, numerous talented young Zimbabwean rugby players have emigrated to play for other nations, mainly South Africa but also Australia, Scotland and other European countries. This trend has continued with players being attracted abroad by better playing and coaching facilities, as well as being pushed by the ever-declining economic climate in their country of origin.\nNotable players.\nOver the years, Zimbabwe have lost much of their rugby talent to other countries. The list of Zimbabwean players who have left to ply their trade elsewhere includes:\nFormer Saracens CEO, Bath Chairman &amp; SA Rugby CEO (whilst triumphant in the 1995 World Cup), Edward Griffiths was born in Zimbabwe.\nOther players of Zimbabwean origin include All Black centre Braydon Ennor, Springbok scrumhalf Ross Cronje and Japan winger Kotaro Matsushima\nMany other Zimbabwe-born players are playing at top levels in New Zealand, South Africa, Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and across Europe.\nRecord.\nZimbabwe record against all nations, updated to 1 July 2022, is as follows:\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nOn the 13th of June, the following 31 players were called up to face the Netherlands in a World Rugby test match as well as to participate in the .\nHead Coach: Piet Benade\nZimbabwe Goshawks.\nThe following players were included in the Zimbabwe Goshawks squad for the 2023 Currie Cup First Division:\nPast Coaches.\n\"Since the 1987\"\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"

        "title": "Frank Patrick (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Francis Alexis Patrick (December 21, 1885 – June 29, 1960) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player, head coach, manager, and executive. Along with his brother Lester, he founded the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the first major professional hockey league in Western Canada. Patrick, who also served as president of the league, took control of the Vancouver Millionaires, serving as a player, coach, and manager of the team. It was in the PCHA that Patrick would introduce many innovations to hockey that remain today, including the blue line, the penalty shot, and tracking assists, among others.\nBorn in Ottawa and raised in Montreal, Patrick first played hockey there along with his brother Lester. In 1904 he made his debut in the top Canadian league, though was limited as he attended McGill University and then moved west to British Columbia with his family in 1907 to establish a lumber company. The Patrick brothers returned to Central Canada in 1909 when they signed with the Renfrew Creamery Kings for one season. The Patrick family sold their lumber company in 1910 and used the proceeds to establish the PCHA, setting up teams in Vancouver, Victoria, and New Westminster. The league soon established itself as a legitimate enterprise, and their champions played for the Stanley Cup starting in 1915. Patrick played for, coached, and managed the Vancouver Millionaires, which won the Cup in 1915, the first team west of Manitoba to do so, and played for the Cup again in 1918, 1921, and 1922, losing each time. Patrick also served as president of the PCHA for nearly its entire existence, and in this role introduced many rules that helped modernize the game, making it both faster and more entertaining.\nIn 1926 the PCHA, which had since merged with the Western Canada Hockey League and was later renamed the Western Hockey League, was sold to the eastern-based National Hockey League (NHL). Patrick would later join the NHL in 1933, serving first in an executive role for the league and then as coach for the Boston Bruins from 1934 to 1936, and worked with the Montreal Canadiens from 1940 to 1941 in a business management role. Outside of hockey he faced financial difficulties, and died in 1960, four weeks after Lester. In recognition of his role in establishing modern hockey, Patrick was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1950.\nEarly life.\nPatrick's father, Joe, was the son of Irish immigrants: Thomas Patrick had emigrated from County Tyrone in Ireland to Canada in 1848 and settled in Quebec. Joe was born in 1857 and in 1883 married Grace Nelson. They moved to Drummondville, Quebec, where Joe worked as a general store clerk and Grace was a schoolmarm. Drummondville was predominantly French-speaking and Catholic at the time, making the Anglophone and Methodist Patrick family a minority in the town. Patrick was born on December 21, 1885, in Ottawa, Ontario, the second son of Joe and Grace Patrick. It is not clear why he was born in Ottawa, which was roughly a five-hour train ride from Drummondville at the time; biographer Eric Whitehead suggested Grace likely needed some specialized care for the birth as the reason for the relocation. In 1887 the family moved to Carmell Hill, where Joe bought a half-interest in a general store with William Mitchell. As in Drummondville the town was mainly Francophone, leading the family to learn French. Joe and his partners sold their store in 1892, earning a substantial profit of $10,000; Joe used his $5,000 to establish a lumber company and built a mill in Daveluyville, which was west of Quebec City. That winter Patrick and his older brother Lester received their first pair of skates. In 1893 the family moved again, this time to Montreal, as Joe expanded his lumber company. They first lived in Pointe-Saint-Charles, a rail district, before moving to the more prosperous suburb of Westmount in 1895. While in Montreal the two older Patrick brothers were first introduced to ice hockey. Patrick attended Stanstead College, a prep school, where he played both hockey and football. They also met Art Ross at this time, who became a close friend of both brothers and had an extensive career in hockey.\nIn 1904 Patrick played his first senior games, with the Montreal Victorias of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League, then the top league in Canada; he recorded four goals in the five games played for the team. While back from school during a break in 1905, he briefly joined the Montreal Westmount club and played two games. Lester was also on the team, and this marked the first time the brothers played together. \nPatrick enrolled at McGill University in Montreal in 1906, and joined their hockey team. The next year Joe purchased a tract of land in the Slocan Valley in southeastern British Columbia (BC), and moved the family west to Nelson, British Columbia, a town near the land, to start a new lumber company there. Patrick remained in Montreal to complete his studies, as he had one year remaining. He played with the Victorias as well during the season, recording eight goals in eight games (he missed the final two games due to a shoulder injury). While professionalism had been allowed in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) at that time, Patrick remained an amateur. He also worked as a referee in league matches, and while he was the youngest official he was considered to be one of the best, the league president at one point calling him the \"most competent referee [they'd] seen all winter\".\nNelson and Renfrew.\nIn April 1908 Patrick graduated from McGill with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was planning to travel west immediately to join his family and work for the new company. However he injured his leg in a baseball game that spring, which forced him to stay in Montreal until September 1908. On arrival he took up a position as a \"timer\", overseeing the 200 labourers who fell trees. He also joined Lester on the local Nelson Hockey Club, which competed in a regional league. Patrick scored nine goals in the five games he played.\nThe following year a new top-level league, the National Hockey Association (NHA), was established; unlike the ECHA, the NHA was openly professional. Several teams began to send offers to both Patrick brothers, who had decided to return east for the winter and play hockey there. Among the teams making offers were the Renfrew Creamery Kings, owned by J. Ambrose O'Brien, a wealthy mining magnate, and when Lester received the offer he replied saying he would join the team for $3,000, an exorbitant salary for the era. Surprised by the offer, Lester asked for his brother as well, and Patrick was offered $2,000 to join the team.\nAlong with other high-profile players, most famously Cyclone Taylor, who signed for a reported $5,250, the team was nicknamed the \"Millionaires\". Along with several teammates, the Patricks lived in a boarding house in Renfrew during the season, and players were often seen together about town. While Lester was more out-spoken, Patrick was quiet and reserved, though that changed when the topic of hockey came up. He became quite lively and was open about his ideas on how to improve the game, and what type of tactics could be used. Taylor would later recall he was quite impressed by the brothers knowledge and views, stating that \"Frank in particular had an amazing grasp of the science of hockey, and they were both already dreaming about changes that would improve the game\". \nDuring the 1909–10 season, Patrick scored 8 goals in 11 games, though the team failed to win the championship. After the season the Creamery Kings went to New York City for an exhibition series against other NHA teams. Patrick was impressed by both the diversity of people living in the city and Madison Square Garden. While it did not have an ice-making plant at the time, Patrick was interested enough to make sketches of the arena, and studied it in detail while he was in New York.\nThe outlandish salaries offered by Renfrew and other teams were unsustainable, and in response the NHA instituted a salary cap of $8,000 per team for the 1910–11 season. Both Patricks had already returned to Nelson, certain their hockey careers were over anyway. They did help build a rink in Nelson, largely financed by their father. Patrick played a few games for Nelson that winter, but was not seriously committed.\nPCHA.\nJoe sold his lumber company in January 1911, making a profit of around $440,000, of which he gave both Lester and Frank $25,000. In a separate transaction Joe also sold a private interest he had, earning a further $35,000. With this money Joe solicited ideas from his family on what to invest in, and Patrick suggested they establish their own hockey league, one based in BC and that they controlled. It was put to a vote, with both Joe and Frank voting in favour and Lester against, so they agreed to move forward. They incorporated the new league, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), on December 7, 1911.\nThe initial plan was to place teams in large cities in Western Canada, with one each in Vancouver and Victoria (both in BC), and one in Edmonton and Calgary (both in Alberta). Issues in finding support for the Alberta-based teams meant that the new league would only be based in BC initially. The mild weather on the West Coast meant that unlike Central and Eastern Canada natural ice could not be used for games, and so the Patrick family built two arenas: the Denman Arena in Vancouver and the Patrick Arena in Victoria. While the arenas were being built Patrick went east to recruit players, offering up to twice the salary they were making in the NHA to join the new league, and was able to recruit several high-profile names. Patrick managed and played for the Vancouver team, while Lester would do the same for the Victoria team. Patrick played all 15 games for Vancouver during the 1912 season, and recorded 23 goals, placing him second on Vancouver for scoring and fourth in the league. The league itself did well and demonstrated it could be a serious challenger to the supremacy of the NHA.\nTo help bolster attendance and improve his team for the 1912–13 season, Patrick signed his former teammate in Renfrew, Cyclone Taylor, who was considered one of the biggest names in hockey at the time. The signing of Taylor to the PCHA gave the league legitimacy. While the first games of the PCHA's inaugural season only had half the tickets sold, the Millionaires sold out their home opener for the 1912–13 season, Taylor's debut in the league. It was the first sell-out for the PCHA. However even with Taylor on the team, Vancouver (who had now began to be known as the \"Millionaires\") did not win the league title, finishing second; Patrick again placed fourth overall in league scoring, and third on Vancouver, with 20 points in 16 games.\nThough the PCHA was effectively a syndicate controlled by the Patrick brothers, initially they had a figurehead president, William Pickering Irving, until 1913 when Patrick assumed the role; he would keep the title for the rest of the league's existence. The PCHA and NHA also came to an agreement that would see an end to player raiding: the PCHA would hold the professional rights to all players west of Port Arthur, Ontario, while the NHA did so for players between Port Arthur and Montreal (players east of that were subject to the Maritime Professional Hockey League). The leagues also agreed to a yearly challenge series between the two teams that won each league for the right to hold the Stanley Cup, effectively ending the challenge era for the Cup. For a third year in a row Vancouver finished second in the league, with Patrick sixth overall in scoring (second on the team), recording 20 points while playing all 16 games in the 1913–14 season.\nThe First World War began before the start of the 1914–15 season, which had a major impact on the league. Patrick initially offered to help form a sportsman's battalion, but the offer was declined by the Canadian government, who preferred to keep the PCHA active in order to boost public morale. Patrick initially retired from playing to focus on coaching and managing the team. However he returned to play near the end of the season to help the defence, ending up in four games during the season with Vancouver. Vancouver won the league championship and competed for the Stanley Cup. The 1915 Final was held in Vancouver, and as the leagues used different rules, games alternated between PCHA and NHA rules. The NHA champions were the Ottawa Senators. Vancouver won the first three games to win the Cup, the first time a PCHA team had done so. Patrick played all three games of the series and had two goals and one assist.\nPrior to the start of the 1915–16 season Patrick led efforts to form a new PCHA team in Seattle, the Seattle Metropolitans, and took an active role in helping build their arena, the Seattle Ice Arena. To help bolster the league, he also saw that the agreement with the NHA end, and both leagues began openly courting signed players. Again sitting out to focus on his off-ice roles, Patrick appeared in eight games during the season and recorded four points. Patrick returned to a full-time playing position for 1916–17 to replace Lloyd Cook, who joined the Spokane Canaries. Patrick played in 23 of the 24 games that season, scoring 26 points.\nBy 1917 the war was causing a serious impact on the PCHA as many players either enlisted or were drafted into the Canadian military. The Spokane franchise was shut down for the 1917–18 season, both as a means to reduce demand on players, and to save money for the league; the players were dispersed to the other three teams. With the changes Patrick again focused on coaching and managing Vancouver and leading the PCHA as a whole. He did appear in one game during the season, scoring a goal. Vancouver defeated Seattle in the playoffs and won the league championship and a chance to play for the Stanley Cup. The National Hockey League (NHL) was formed in November 1917 to replace the NHA as the top league in Central Canada. The NHL kept the agreement to play the PCHA for the Stanley Cup, and the NHL's champion Toronto Arenas hosted Vancouver for the 1918 Stanley Cup Finals. Toronto won the best-of-five series three games to two, with Patrick not playing in any games. \nPatrick did not play during the 1918–19 season, one in which Vancouver finished first in the league, though they lost in the playoffs to Seattle. In order to have more time for his league duties and other business affairs, Patrick hired Cook as playing-manager for the 1919–20 season. Patrick would only appear in six more games as a player: twice during the 1922–23 season and for four games during the 1924–25 season. Vancouver played for the Cup again in 1921, when they hosted Ottawa, and 1922 against the Toronto St. Patricks, losing both times.\nNHL.\nBy the early 1920s the PCHA was losing money. Seattle folded in 1924, and with only two teams left (Vancouver and Victoria), the Patricks decided to merge with the Western Canada Hockey League, which was renamed the Western Hockey League (WHL). The WHL continued for two seasons until 1926, though with continued financial difficulties and expansion plans by the NHL (which would add three teams between 1924 and 1926, growing to ten teams overall) it was clear the league would not be sustainable. With the consent of five of the six WHL teams Patrick met with the NHL and offered to sell the rights to WHL players to the league for a lump sum, allowing the NHL to quickly stock the expansion teams being set up. This was agreed to, and for $100,000 the Victoria team was transferred to Detroit, who named themselves the Detroit Cougars in recognition. The Chicago team, later named the Black Hawks, also paid $100,000 for players, receiving the Portland Rosebuds. The Boston Bruins, whose owner Charles Adams and manager Art Ross had helped facilitate the sale, also purchased select players, paying a total of $17,000, netting the WHL owners a total of $267,000. Patrick was offered positions with both the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars, but he refused their offers.\nIn 1933 he was given a position with the NHL as managing director of the league. In this role he served under NHL president Frank Calder, overseeing on-ice officials and enforcing rules. Prior to the start of the 1933–34 season Patrick announced he would be working to cut down on the violence endemic in the sport and see stronger punishment for infractions. He also implemented some new rules, including a crease around the goal; allowing players to stop flying pucks with their hands; and a major penalty for touching an official in any manner. In this role Patrick oversaw the suspension of Eddie Shore for his hit on Ace Bailey during a December 12, 1933, game that saw Bailey hit his head on the ice and nearly die. Initially suspending Shore for six games, once it was clear Bailey would live (though he was forced to retire from playing), Patrick increased the suspension to 16 games, the longest in NHL history to that time. Shortly after a benefit game was played for Bailey in February 1934, Patrick resigned his role. It is not clear why he did so, but historian J. Andrew Ross has suggested Patrick was expecting to take over from Calder as president of the league in short order, and left when that was not going to happen.\nThat off-season Art Ross, who had been working as the general manager and coach of the Boston Bruins, offered the coaching position to Patrick for the 1934–35 season, so Ross could focus on managing the team. Patrick accepted, earning $10,500 for the season. However the two did not work well together, and after two seasons with the team Patrick was let go in 1936, with Ross again assuming the coaching duties. There were also allegations that Patrick was drunk during the Bruins' series against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1936 playoffs; Patrick's daughter Francis instead thought that he may have had bipolar disorder, though a diagnosis was never made.\nLater life.\nAfter the WHL disbanded in 1926, Patrick spent the next two years away from hockey. He became involved in prospecting for gold and silver in the Cariboo Mountains region of BC, though was unsuccessful. In 1933 he borrowed money from Joe and invested into mining and oil interests in BC, though gave that up after four years and losing most of the investment, which totaled around $300,000. \nIn 1928 he helped form a new minor league, the Pacific Coast Hockey League. Patrick owned one team, the Vancouver Lions, and served as the first president of the league. He also continued to manage the Denman Arena, which he kept busy with events. However the Denman Arena burned down the night of August 19, 1936. He was hired by the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL in April 1940 to work as the business manager of the team, however conflicts with the team's manager Tommy Gorman led to Patrick leaving after a few months in 1941 when he took a up a position with the Canadian Car and Foundry, which was owned by the same group that owned the Canadiens. \nAfter his hockey career Patrick had financial issues, which led to him developing an alcohol addiction. Lester tried to help financially, and the NHL provided a $300 per month pension. He also kept working on innovations for hockey, including an unbreakable hockey stick developed with lamination process, however by the time it was finished fibre glass sticks had been created, making Patrick's model obsolete. \nLester died on June 1, 1960, in Victoria. Patrick was not well and was unable to attend the funeral of his brother, and on June 29, 1960, he too died, in Vancouver from a heart attack. Patrick and his wife Catherine had three children: one son and two daughters.\nLegacy.\nPatrick, along with his brother Lester, is credited with helping shape modern hockey. His Hockey Hall of Fame biography notes that he is \"credited with 22 changes that remain in the NHL rulebook\". Among the innovations they introduced was officially tracking assists and allowing goaltenders to stop a puck any way they wanted (previously they had to remain on their feet). In 1913 they decided to add lines on the ice, thereby dividing the surface into zones and allowing forward passing in certain zones, which allowed for a faster-paced game. Patrick devised the penalty shot in 1921 as a means to counteract fouls on good scoring chances. The Patricks are also credited with introducing numbers to player sweaters for identification purposes (starting in 1911–12), but this had been had also been experimented with in the NHA at the same time. In recognition of his contributions to the sport, Patrick was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1950. \nPatrick also played a role in the early development of women's hockey. After establishing the PCHA, he helped found the Vancouver Amazons, a women's team. As early as January 1916, the Patrick brothers talked of forming a women's league to complement the PCHA and occupy dates for their arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The proposal included teams from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland, and Seattle. The league never formed but in January 1917, the \"Vancouver News-Advertiser\" reported that wives of the Seattle Metropolitans had assembled a team. In February 1921, Patrick announced a women's international championship series that would be played in conjunction with the PCHA. A series of games were held over that month with teams from Seattle, Vancouver, and Victoria, playing during intermissions of PCHA games. Both Seattle and Victoria's teams disbanded after the series, and Patrick did not further develop a women's league."

        "title": "Major Harris (American football)",
        "text": "Major Harris (born February 15, 1968) is an American former college football player who was a quarterback for the West Virginia Mountaineers during the 1980s. Harris was a first-team All-American in 1989 and finished fifth and third in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1988 and 1989, respectively. He was also the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Player of the Year in 1988 and 1989. Harris was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009.\nHarris played professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and Arena Football League (AFL). He is now an assistant wide receivers coach for North Hills High School in Pittsburgh.\nEarly life.\nHarris played football at Brashear High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (he would later be called the Brashear Bullet by West Virginia announcer Jack Fleming).\nAs a senior, Harris threw a game-winning, 79-yard touchdown pass on the last play of the game against Indiana High School. Harris was named Pittsburgh's high school football player of the year after his junior and senior seasons by the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", and was a \"Sporting News\" Top 100 prospect following his final season.\nCollege career.\nFreshman (1987).\nHarris took an offer at West Virginia, where coach Don Nehlen was trying to rebuild the quarterback position. Nehlen set up a football camp for two-hand touch football and stated, \"The kids couldn't touch him.\"\nNehlen signed Florida prep quarterback Browning Nagle along with Harris and redshirted them for the season. Harris and Nagle battled it out in spring practice and Harris eventually won the job, so Nagle transferred to University of Louisville.\nHarris struggled at first, but when the fifth game came around at East Carolina University, Harris stood out and ended West Virginia's season with a bid to the Sun Bowl against Oklahoma State University. West Virginia lost, but Harris rushed for over 100 yards. That season, Harris threw for 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns on only 77 completions. Harris also rushed for 615 yards and 6 touchdowns.\nSophomore (1988).\nThe following season, he directed West Virginia to the school's first-ever undefeated, untied regular season and a matchup against No. 1 ranked Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. In getting the Mountaineers to the Fiesta Bowl, Harris baffled opponents all season with his daring, unpredictable, wide-open style. Against Boston College, Harris recorded a career-high 297 passing yards. Harris's dazzling play was never more evident than in West Virginia's 51–30 dismantling of long-time nemesis Penn State. Harris outgained the entire Penn State team, 301 to 292, and produced the school's most exciting run ever in the first quarter of that game. That run and several more like it helped him finish fifth in the Heisman Trophy race that year and earn ECAC player of the year honors. His season passing totals were 1,915 yards and 14 touchdowns, while he rushed for 610 yards and 6 touchdowns. He had the highest passing-efficiency rating of any college quarterback during the season, and totaled 2,348 total yards of offense and averaging 8.4 yards per touch. As the Mountaineers traveled to their first ever National Championship game, the Irish were favored. But on the third play of the game, Major Harris was hit and separated his shoulder. Harris stayed in the game, but didn't throw the ball often, scrambling instead. West Virginia never threatened Notre Dame's lead, and the Fighting Irish won, 34–21.\n\"The Play\".\nAgainst Penn State in 1988, as the play clock wound down, Harris forgot the play he had called in the huddle. As soon as the ball was snapped, the entire West Virginia team went in one direction and Harris went the other. He faked out the entire Penn State team leaving no fewer than seven tacklers grabbing air on the way to a thrilling touchdown—and one of the more memorable plays in WVU history. The Mountaineers won the game, 51–30.\nHarris's coach, Don Nehlen, said of the run, \"I had called 37 and he ran 36. Everybody else on our offense went one way, and Major went the other. He literally ran through the Penn State defense for a touchdown of about 30 yards. After he scored, Major came to the sideline and apologized. He said, \"My fault, Coach.\" People still ask me about that play all of the time...If there was a contest for most exciting player, Major would win it hands down.\"\nJunior (1989).\nAs a junior in 1989, Harris was equally spectacular despite not having as strong a supporting cast. Harris still led WVU to a 8-2-1 season. Against Rutgers during the season, Harris had a career-high 163 rushing yards. He finished third in the 1989 Heisman Trophy balloting on the season, earned first team Kodak All-America honors and was a second team AP and \"Football News\" All American. Like 1988, Harris was again voted ECAC player of the year. That year, Harris led the Mountaineers to a Gator Bowl game, but they lost to Clemson, 27–7. Harris threw for 2,058 yards and 17 touchdowns on the season, along with 936 and 6 touchdowns rushing. Harris set school records that season for most total offense and quarterback rushing yards. Both records, however, have since been broken.\nLegacy.\nHarris established a WVU record with 7,334 total yards (ranks #7 through 2018 season), and became the first of just a handful of quarterbacks in Division I history to pass for more than 5,000 yards and rush for more than 2,000 yards in a career. His 2,161 rushing yards rank 17th (through 2021 season) on the school's all-time rushing list. Harris's longest pass of his career was 70 yards and his longest run was 75 yards.\nHarris was selected for the 2009 College Football Hall of Fame induction class.\nIn 2021, West Virginia University retired Major's #9 jersey.\nProfessional career.\nNFL and CFL.\nAfter the completion of his junior year, Harris decided to leave school early and was drafted in the 12th round by the Los Angeles Raiders in the 1990 NFL Draft. However, Harris instead chose to sign with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in May 1990. He spent the 1990 season backing up quarterbacks Doug Flutie and Joe Paopao. In limited duty, Harris completed 18 of 42 passes for 300 yards, with three touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed for 145 yards and three scores.\nArena Football League.\nHarris then spent three years in the Arena Football League (1991–1992, 1994) where his 429 rushing yards in his first season of 1991 stood as the single-season league record until Michael Bishop ran for 459 yards in 2005. In 1991, Harris also passed for 940 yards, with nine touchdowns and nine interceptions. The next season, he passed for 837 yards, 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Harris finished his third season in Arena Football with 382 yards passing and eight touchdowns in 1994. Harris's Arena Football League career statistics include 2,159 yards and 29 touchdowns passing and 837 yards and 23 touchdowns rushing.\nMinor league football.\nHarris signed with the Washington Marauders of the Professional Spring Football League in January 1992, but the league folded before the season began. He played for the West Virginia Lightning and the Huntington Hawks in the National Minor Football League (NMFL) from 1994 to 1996. The West Virginia Lightning won the NMFL Championship under Harris's command. The NMFL consisted of teams in the eastern United States from Texas to Maine.\nHarris also played for the Ohio Cannon of the short-lived Regional Football League in 1999, and the Southern Michigan Timberwolves in the Mid-Continental Football League (MCFL) in Monroe, Michigan, for the 1999 and 2000 seasons. He later played for the Charleston Swamp Foxes of AF2 in 2003."

        "text": "Freddie Brown Lane Jr. (September 6, 1975 – July 6, 2000) was an American football running back who played professionally in the National Football League for the Carolina Panthers.\nEarly life.\nLane was born and raised in Franklin, Tennessee. His father, Fred Lane Sr., was a star at the old Natchez High School, which later desegregated with Franklin High. Attending Franklin Junior High School, it was noticed that Lane possessed uncommon speed and agility for such a young player. Lane attended Franklin High School, amassing over 1,000 yards his senior year, while averaging 7.5 yards per carry. His number, 28, is retired by the school. He had two daughters: Régine Lane and Pilarr Lane.\nCollege career.\nLane attended Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee. He finished his career with 3,612 rushing yards, establishing himself as the school's all-time leading rusher. As of 2012, Lane still held the school records for rushing yards in a career, season (1,853 in 1995) and game (305 versus Miles College), as well as rushing attempts and per carry average. As a junior in 1995, Lane finished the season on the Harlon Hill Trophy watchlist, the NCAA Division II Player of the Year award. In the same year, Lane was named to the Heritage Radio HBCU All American team, as well as several other media services' All American teams. Lane's college number, #6, was retired by Lane College.\nProfessional career.\nLane was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Panthers before the 1997 NFL season. He had a remarkable rookie season, setting several franchise records, many of which still stand (see below). Though Lane started only about half his games, he led Carolina in rushing attempts, yards, and touchdowns in 1997 and 1998, before the balance of touches tipped towards Tim Biakabutuka in 1999. During his three years with the Panthers, Lane accumulated 2,001 rushing yards (the most in franchise history at the time) and 13 touchdowns.\nAfter three years, Lane was traded to the Indianapolis Colts shortly before his death on July 6, 2000.\nNFL career statistics.\nFranchise records.\n off-season, Lane still held several Panthers records, including:\nDeath.\nOn July 6, 2000, Fred's wife, Deidra Lane, shot and killed him as he entered their home. His keys were still in the lock and he had been shot twice with a 12-gauge shotgun - once in the chest and a second time in the back of the head, apparently at point-blank range. Deidra Lane pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 2003.\nProsecutors at her sentencing described Deidra Lane as an abusive woman who killed her husband for life insurance. Defense attorneys called her a battered wife who killed in self-defense. A judge sentenced her to seven years and 11 months, ruling her actions were premeditated and deliberate, that she acted with malice and shot him a second time after he had already been rendered helpless.\nDeidra Lane received credit for jail time served waiting on a federal charge of conspiracy to commit bank larceny. She pleaded guilty and served four months for that charge. Lane was released on March 3, 2009."

        "text": "The Australia A cricket team toured Pakistan in September 2005. Australia A are a team made up of the second tier of Australian cricketers, just below the national team. They played two first class games against Pakistan A, one which they lost by seven wickets, and one draw. In addition, they played three one-day games before departing Pakistan, chasing down a total winning the first by seven wickets, losing the other by eight wickets and 14 overs, but coming back to take a 97-run win in the third.\nMatch details.\nFirst-class series.\nFirst Match: Pakistan A v Australia A, 11 September–13 September.\nPakistan A won by seven wickets\nRain and poor conditions stopped play early on the first two days at Rawalpindi, but the conditions were friendly for the home side's bowlers, who got 20 wickets for 326 runs in total in the match. Shahid Nazir took three wickets on the first day, removing Michael Hussey and Shane Watson for single-figure scores, while Mohammad Sami took care of Brad Hodge and captain Brad Haddin. The tourists did recover from 43 for 4, however, thanks to Phil Jaques. He hit 56 on the first day and added a further 36 on the second, while his team mates deserted him and the team was all out for 196, Shoaib Malik wrapping up the tail with two wickets.\nMost of the Pakistani batsmen got starts on the second day, but only two passed 30 - Bazid Khan and, surprisingly, Mohammad Sami. Sami and wicket-keeper Zulqarnain Haider fought back with a 49-run stand for the seventh wicket, and Pakistan were 181 for 7 by the close of the second day's play. On the third morning, Zulqarnain battled on, adding 47 with Mansoor Amjad before Cam White dismissed Amjad and Watson removed Umar Gul and Shahid Nazir quickly.\nTrailing by 17 on first innings, Australia A were once again shocked by Sami, but Umar Gul also joined the fray as the first five wickets fell for 33 runs. Only Hussey passed ten of the top five, and it was only thanks to 30s from captain Haddin and Nathan Bracken that Australia passed 100. Chasing 114 to win, Salman Butt and Shoaib Malik flayed the Australian opening bowlers, as Bracken ended with 4-0-26-0 and Mick Lewis with 3-1-19-0. They were both dismissed by White, who got three wickets, yet conceded 36 in 5.5 overs. Pakistan A reached their target in 19.5 overs, taking a convincing victory.\nScorecard from Pakistan Cricket Board\nSecond Match: Pakistan A v Australia A, 17 September–20 September.\nMatch drawn\nAustralia A dominated the first day, mostly thanks to 146 from James Hopes, who had come in as a replacement for Phil Jaques. The Pakistani bowling attack who had been so effective a week earlier had been replaced, with only Mansoor Amjad retained from the previous game, and the Pakistan A team had seven new faces. They conceded 19 no-balls in a day, as Australia A racked up 318 runs for the loss of five wickets, and Hopes scored 146. The second day was rained off, but the tourists added 89 in 17 overs on the third day, as Shane Watson got a half-century. Pakistan A, batting second, had Hasan Raza to thank for even getting near a competitive score - the 23-year-old batsman added 111 not out from number five, defying off spinner Dan Cullen to help Pakistan A to 249 for 6 at the close of play on day three.\nRaza was dismissed early on the fourth morning, lbw to Stuart Clark for 116, Pakistan A's only century of the series. Stubborn resistance from Mansoor Amjad and Mohammad Irshad, however, added 74 for the ninth wicket in about 30 overs, before Marcus North got two wickets with his first three balls on tour, ending with the figures of 0.3-0-0-2. With a slender lead of 59, Australia A batted out 48 overs with Michael Hussey scoring 101 not out, as Australia A added 181 for no loss before the captains agreed to a draw.\nCricinfo scorecard\nOne-day Series.\nFirst Match: Pakistan A v Australia A, 23 September.\nAustralia A won by seven wickets\nAustralia A recorded their first win of the series, as their bowlers backed up captain Hussey's decision to bowl first. After five overs, Pakistan A had scampered seven runs, before Salman Butt gave a catch to Hussey. Catches were indeed the favoured dismissal method of the day - all ten Pakistan A batsmen were caught, but none by the wicket-keeper Chris Hartley. Pakistan A never got off the mark, and they were 36 for 6 after 17.5 overs. A small fight-back by Hasan Raza and Zulqarnain, whose seventh-wicket stand was worth 29, was ended when the latter was caught by Hopes, and despite a six from Mohammad Sami, Pakistan A closed on 96 all out. Yasir Arafat took two wickets with three balls for Pakistan, but Jaques remained confident, smashing ten fours in front of the square in his 64. Australia A eased to 97 for 3, winning with over two thirds of their innings potentially remaining.\nScorecard from The Cricket Site\nSecond Match: Pakistan A v Australia A, 25 September.\nPakistan A won by eight wickets\nAustralia A lost four wickets with the first 43 balls, and though they managed to face every single one but one of the 300 allotted balls, their total was not enough to defend against Pakistan's batsmen. Umar Gul got the most wickets, dismissing James Hopes, Marcus North, Mike Hussey and Mick Lewis on his way to four for 51, while Mohammad Asif bowled five no-balls and still conceded 35. Only two players made it past 15 for Australia; captain Hussey scored 31 and shared a 63-run stand with Cam White, who went on to make an unbeaten 106. It was to be the highest score of the match, but though Lewis had Ashar Zaidi lbw for 12 in the fourth over, Pakistan A only lost one further wicket in chasing the target. Shoaib Malik got his century, hitting four sixes and twelve fours, and Pakistan A ended with a total of 208 for 2 in 35.5 overs. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nThird Match: Pakistan A v Australia A, 27 September.\nAustralia A won by 97 runs\nAustralia A came back from the defeat two days earlier, and, at the same stadium (Gaddafi Stadium), it was the tourists who handed out a victory which by the net run rate method was just as comprehensive as Pakistan A's two days earlier. Once again, their first four wickets fell with the batsmen on sub-11 scores, but it took time to get them out; Marcus North made 10 off 26 balls and Hussey two runs off 21. At the same time, Phil Jaques was hitting runs at the other end, ensuring that the score was 87 for 4 after 19.2 overs. Yasir Arafat, who got the wickets of North and Hussey and bowled two maiden overs, nevertheless conceded 60 in his other eight overs to end with figures of 10–2–60–2, and with 44 from Shane Watson and 59 not out for White, Australia A posted a total of 273 for 7 when their 50 overs had been completed. Pakistan A then lost four wickets in 31 balls, Salman Butt, Zaidi, Imran Farhat and Hasan Raza all departing in single figures to see Pakistan to 16 for 4. Stuart Clark and Nathan Bracken were the perpetrators, and when the ball changed hands, wickets fell again. Seven men bowled for Australia; all of them got at least one wicket, while Dan Cullen joined Bracken and Clark in getting two, despite bowling the least of all the seven. Cullen dismissed Umar Gul for two in the 37th over, and two overs later he got the last wicket of the match by taking a return catch off Bazid Khan's bat. Khan had made 95, the highest score of the innings by some distance, as the second-highest score was 25. Pakistan A were all out for 176, and lost the series 1–2. (Cricinfo scorecard)"

        "text": "The British American Football League (BAFL) was the United Kingdom's primary American football league from 1998 until 2010. It was formerly known as the British Senior League (BSL) until 2005. BAFL was the trading name for Gridiron Football League Ltd incorporated as a Company limited by guarantee. Registration number: 2353839. The company went into administration on 1 April 2010, and the company ceased to trade as from this date.\nThe League had 3 divisions: Premier, 1 and 2, each with a playoff series and championship game to determine a winner. The Championship participants were promoted to the divisions above and the lowest-ranking teams in each division are relegated. Only clubs from England, Scotland and Wales played; clubs in Northern Ireland competed against Republic of Ireland clubs in an all-Ireland Irish American Football League.\nTeams competed annually to reach the championship game (BritBowl) and win the Boston Trophy. The game was traditionally hosted at Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium, however the venue for the finals was switched in 2008 because of a schedule conflict with Rotherham United FC, the stadium's temporary tenants, with the match instead being played at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster.\nTensions grew between the directors of BAFL and those of the British American Football Association, the governing body throughout 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, BAFL formally, but unconstitutionally, withdrew from BAFA. This led to uproar from the teams within BAFL, ultimately signalling the end for BAFL as an entity. The league ceased operations on 1 April 2010. The league was replaced by the BAFA Community Leagues for the 2010 season. This organisation, run under the umbrella of the governing body, rebranded in 2011 to become the BAFA National Leagues."

        "title": "Cycling advocacy",
        "text": "Cycling advocacy consists of activities that call for, promote or enable increased adoption and support for cycling and improved safety and convenience for cyclists, usually within urbanized areas or semi-urban regions. Issues of concern typically include policy, administrative and legal changes (the consideration of cycling in all governance); advocating and establishing better cycling infrastructure (including road and junction design and the creation, maintenance of bike lanes and separate bike paths, and bike parking); public education regarding the health, transportational and environmental benefits of cycling for both individuals and communities, cycling and motoring skills; and increasing public and political support for bicycling.\nThere are many organisations worldwide whose primary mission is to advocate these goals. Most are non-profit organisations supported by donations, membership dues, and volunteers.\nCycling advocacy around the world.\nInternationally.\nIn 2018 the United Nations General Assembly designated 3 June as World Bicycle Day, after it had been proposed by World Cycling Alliance.\nEurope.\nBicycle embassies.\nIn Europe, Bicycle embassies have been set up to communicate established bodies of knowledge concerning cycling infrastructure, bicycle promotion and cycling advocacy techniques to other national, state and municipal governments.\nEstablished bicycle embassies include the Dutch Cycling Embassy, the Cycling Embassy of Denmark and the Cycling Embassy of Great Britain.\nCopenhagenization.\nCopenhagenization is a design strategy in which urban planning and design are centered on making a city more accessible to bicyclists and pedestrians and less car dependent.\nThe term was popularised by Danish urban design consultant Jan Gehl, who has been instrumental in the promotion and implementation of the policy in Copenhagen.\nFor more than 40 years, Mr. Gehl has systematically studied public spaces to see how they really work, using Strøget and Copenhagen as a laboratory for his research. He has advised cities around the world, including Melbourne, London and New York, on how to improve the quality of urban life -- in his words, how to \"Copenhagenize\" their cities.\nIndependently of Gehl, Danish urban design consultant Mikael Colville-Andersen coined and popularized the phrase the term in this meaning to a broader audience, starting in 2007 with the \"Copenhagenize.com blog\", that highlights how the bicycle can be an important tool in the creation of liveable cities. The term has since spread to Britain, to Europe, and elsewhere internationally. The \"Copenhagenize.com\" blog has inspired the creation of other blogs with the same focus for cities such as Amsterdam, Portland, Lisbon, Hamburg and Munich.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland the direct action group, I BIKE Dublin advocates for improved conditions for cycling in Dublin through direct action campaigns.\nNorth America.\nIn North America the term \"Bicycle Ambassador\" arose to describe cycling advocates tasked with promoting bicycling in a community. Such advocates can be employed by the national, provincial or city government and their tasks include networking extensively with other municipal offices whose activities effect cycling.\nEarly \"Bicycle Ambassador\" programs began in Toronto in the late 1990s. Other cities picked it up over the following decade, Chicago being the largest. Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, California, Seattle, Washington, and Arlington, Virginia, also have programs. Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York City began programs most recently. Some programs are entirely youth focused, while others become a de facto part of the city Department of Transportation or other government agency.\nLatin America.\nThe World Bike Forum was organized in 2012 after the Critical Mass events in Porto Alegre in which an automobile driver deliberately collided with and injured around 20 cyclists. During the Forum bicycle-based urban mobility is discussed and strategies to spread the use of bicycles in the hosting city are promoted.\nThe Forum has taken place in the Southern Brazil cities of Porto Alegre (2012 and 2013), Curitiba (2014), as well as Medellín, Colombia (2015) and Mexico City in 2017.\nAsia.\nThailand.\nThailand has a plethora of bicycle advocacy groups including, Thai Cycling Club, the Thai Cycling for Health Association, and the Bangkok Bicycle Campaign. These advocacy groups participate in activities such as campaigning, influencing cycling policy outcomes, leading political discussions, organize events, and conduct cycling related research. \nThe Thailand Bike and Walk Forum was formed by the Thai Cycling Club (TCC) and the Thailand Walking and Cycling Institute Foundation (TWCI) in 2013. The forum meets annually to bring attention to cycling and walking as viable solutions to global issues including health-related and environmentally-related issues. \nThe Philippines.\nThe World Cycling Alliance, a global cycling advocacy group, founded an NGO in 2000 in the Philippines called the Firefly Brigade. The Firefly Brigade's mission is to promote cycling and to empower to citizens to get involved in cycling advocacy. \nAfrica.\nLebogang Mokwena.\nLebogang Mokwena is a Bicycle Mayor for Cape Town. She contributed to an event called 'Co-create My City', an information exchange between South Africa and the Netherlands. She spoke on topics including how cycling can break down racial barriers and offer citizens unique perspectives of their cities. \nList of cycling advocacy groups and individuals.\nAmong the world's best known cycling advocates are:\nMajor cycle advocacy groups include:\nSee list of United States bicycle advocacy organizations\nSee also.\nBicycle advocacy groups, movements and regional examples.\nNorth Carolina"

        "title": "List of first overall Major League Baseball draft picks",
        "text": "The first-year player draft, also known as the Rule 4 Draft, is the primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. Unlike most professional sports, MLB does not permit the trading of draft picks. Since 2023, the first six selections are determined by a lottery; the previous season's standings determine the remaining selections. If two teams have identical records, the team with the worse record in the previous season will receive the higher pick. In addition, teams that lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded \"compensatory\" picks. The first draft took place in 1965; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top-level prospects and therefore, monopolizing the player market. Originally, three drafts were held each year. The first draft took place in June and involved high-school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons. The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December. The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues. The August draft was eliminated after two years, and the January draft lasted until 1986.\nIn 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's first draft pick after being selected by the Kansas City Athletics. Paul Skenes is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2023. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 have participated in the All-Star Game, and four (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, Bryce Harper, and Carlos Correa) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, and the others were drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University , Vanderbilt University , and Louisiana State University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when Ken Griffey Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3 percent of votes cast. Griffey has since been joined by three other top picks: Chipper Jones, inducted in 2018; Harold Baines, elected in December 2018 and inducted in July 2019, and Joe Mauer, inducted in 2024.\nIn the 58 drafts that have taken place through 2022, 22 of the 30 MLB franchises have had the first pick at least once. The Toronto Blue Jays, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, and Colorado Rockies have never had the first pick. The Montreal Expos never had the first pick, but the Nationals, their successor, have had it twice. The Oakland Athletics have never had the first pick, but the Kansas City Athletics, their predecessor, had the first pick in MLB draft history. The Pittsburgh Pirates have had the first overall pick a record six times, while the New York Mets, San Diego Padres, and Houston Astros have each had the first overall pick five times.\nFootnotes.\n Goodwin chose to attend university instead of signing with the Chicago White Sox, and re-entered the draft once he graduated in 1975.\n Hochevar played college baseball for the University of Tennessee, and was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005, but did not agree to a contract. He re-entered the draft in 2006 after spending the previous year with the independent Fort Worth Cats."

        "title": "Handspring (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A handspring (also \"flic-flac\" or \"flip-flop\") is an acrobatic move in which a person executes a complete revolution of the body by lunging headfirst from an upright position into an inverted vertical position and then pushing off (i.e., \"springing\") from the floor with the hands so as to leap back to an upright position. The direction of body rotation in a handspring may be either forward or backward, and either kind may be performed from a stationary standing position or while in motion.\nHandsprings are performed in various physical activities, including acro dance, cheerleading and gymnastics. In competitive activities, handsprings may be judged on a number of criteria.\nDescription.\nTypes.\nThe direction of body rotation in a handspring may be either forward or backward, resulting in a front handspring or back handspring, respectively. In a back handspring, the performer does not see where the hands will land until after the move has begun.\nA \"standing\" handspring is one that begins from a stationary standing position. For example, a back handspring that begins with the performer in a stationary standing position is a \"standing back handspring\".\nBody movement may be terminated upon completion of a handspring, or the performer's momentum may be leveraged so as to immediately perform another handspring or other rotational move (e.g., a flip, such as a tuck or layout). Similarly, another rotational move (e.g., a roundoff) may precede a handspring in order to develop sufficient momentum for the handspring.\nIn gymnastics.\nIn artistic gymnastics, handsprings are commonly performed in the floor exercise, vault, and balance beam events. Back handsprings on the floor are typically preceded by a roundoff, and the two skills together provide the gymnast acceleration and power to perform backward somersaults.\nTechnique.\nA standing back handspring begins with a three phase sequence. In the first phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet. In the second, the gymnast swings the arms down by the sides of the torso, bends the knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. In the last phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears, uses the back muscles to propel the upper body, and jumps into the air. The gymnast transitions to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a \"hollow\" shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position. Handsprings are performed on the balance beam with more vertical and less horizontal force compared to those performed on the floor, perhaps to make it easier to place the hands on the narrow beam.\nVariations.\nA front handspring can be started from a stationary standing position, but it is more common for gymnasts to hurdle into front handsprings at a run. It is also possible to precede a front handspring with a \"step out\", which is similar to a handspring but lands one foot at a time and can be performed on beam the same way it is performed on floor.\nA variation of the back handspring often performed on the balance beam is called the \"back handspring step-out\". In this variation, the gymnast splits the legs upon takeoff, attains a full split when inverted, and lands one foot at a time. This variation is often used at the beginning of combinations with other elements and involves less force on the gymnast's arms after making hand contact with the beam.\nSome handspring variations involve twists. The Worley consists of a back handspring with a half twist in the first flight phase that turns it into a front handspring. Other skills involve partial handsprings, such as the Onodi, which is a back handspring with a half twist in the first flight phase to a front walkover after the gymnast is in handstand.\nHandsprings are used to generate power for vault. The simplest vault performed at competitions consists of a front handspring with the repulsion performed from the vault surface. Vaults are grouped depending on whether the handspring is performed forward or backwards and by whether there is a twist in the air as the gymnast springs onto the vault. For example, the Tsukahara vault family uses a twisting front handspring, while the Yurchenko vaults use a back handspring.\nIn another variation of a front handspring, called a flyspring, the gymnast's feet are held together from beginning to end. Therefore, in order to do a flyspring, the gymnast must jump into it."

        "title": "Jorge Sosa (baseball)",
        "text": "Jorge Bolivar Sosa (born April 28, 1977) is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Washington Nationals, and Florida Marlins. Sosa also played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chunichi Dragons and Yokohama DeNA BayStars.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nSigned by the Colorado Rockies as an amateur free agent in , Sosa spent his first five minor league seasons as an outfielder, but was converted to a pitcher when it was discovered that his arm strength was superior to his batting abilities. He throws his fastball as high as 99 MPH, but usually resides in the mid-90s. He also throws a curveball, slider, and a changeup.\nSosa spent time in the minor league organizations of the Rockies, Seattle Mariners, and Milwaukee Brewers before heading to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a Rule 5 draft pick. Sosa was traded from the Devil Rays to the Atlanta Braves for infielder Nick Green just before the season.\nMajor League Baseball.\n2005.\nSosa enjoyed a breakout season with the Braves in 2005. After starting the year in the bullpen, he was moved to the rotation in June following a rash of injuries to Braves starting pitchers. Sosa was excited about having the opportunity to start, and responded by going 11-3 as a starter and giving the rotation a major shot in the arm for the season's stretch run. For the year, Sosa was 13-3 with an impressive 2.55 ERA. More impressive, however, was his 8-0 record on the road. This earned him a start in game three of the National League Division Series in Houston, Texas against the Houston Astros.\nSosa pitched well in his postseason debut, but was outdueled by Astros ace Roy Oswalt in an eventual Houston win, finally handing Sosa a defeat away from Turner Field in Atlanta. Still, if not for his performance, it's likely that Atlanta's consecutive string of division championships (which reached 14 before the 2006 season, when the Braves' run finally ended) would have been snapped.\nDuring his strong 2005 season, Sosa earned a reputation for his extraordinary ability to get out of jams he created for himself, as opposing batters hit just .194 with runners in scoring position, and .063 with the bases loaded.\n2006.\nSosa signed a one-year contract worth $2.2 million with the Braves, and entered the season back in the rotation. He had a poor start, going 2-9, and allowing a high number of home runs. His struggles, coupled with the Braves' unstable bullpen, prompted manager Bobby Cox to try Sosa in relief. Sosa was ineffective in that role and was designated for assignment on July 30, 2006. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor league pitcher Rich Scalamandre on July 31, 2006. Sosa compiled a 5.28 ERA in his short stint with the Cardinals and was not included on the postseason roster, missing the Cardinals' victory in the 2006 World Series. He was not offered a contract, making him a free agent.\nThe pitcher hit his first career home run on April 6, 2006, off Jeff Fassero of the San Francisco Giants. The only other two hits Sosa recorded that season were also home runs. Sosa also pitched for the Dominican Republic in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\n2007.\nSosa started the 2007 season with yet another one-year contract, this time for $1.25 million and as a member of the New York Mets, and playing for the Mets' Triple-A affiliate in New Orleans. One month into the season, Orlando Hernández suffered an injury, and Sosa was called up to take his place in the starting rotation while he was recovering.\nOn May 5, 2007, he made his season debut for the Mets, in a road game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In a very solid performance, Sosa held the Diamondbacks scoreless for the first 6 innings of the game. After recording the first out in the 7th, he was pulled from the game when he allowed the next 2 men to reach bases. Both runners would eventually come around to score. However, the Mets bullpen allowed no further runs to be scored, securing a win for the Mets and for Sosa by the score of 6-2. Sosa's final stat line for his Mets debut was: 6 IP, 4 hits, 2 Runs, 2 ERs, 2 BBs, 3 Ks.\nSosa continued to pitch well in his games following his debut. In his first three starts with the Mets, he lasted more than 6 innings in every start and gave up no more than 2 runs in any of these appearances. As a result of his hot start, when the time came for Hernandez to come off the disabled list, the Mets chose to keep Sosa with the team and have him replace struggling rookie Mike Pelfrey in the starting rotation on a permanent basis.\nOn June 8, after pitching eight shutout innings, Sosa became the first Mets pitcher in team history to win six of his first seven starts with the team.\nOn July 2, The Mets placed Sosa on the 15-day disabled list, after he suffered a hamstring injury.\nOn July 17, Sosa returned from the DL to pitch well in a start against the San Diego Padres, giving up only 2 runs in 6 innings pitched. He ended up a hard-luck loser in the game as the Mets offense failed to provide him much run support, and the bullpen failed to keep the game close at the end. The Mets lost this game by a score of 5-1. Sosa made two starts after this game, but his performances in them were awful.\nAfter July 31, Sosa was used as a relief pitcher instead of a starter, and pitcher Brian Lawrence replaced him in the starting rotation. Sosa performed well early on in this new role, posting a 1.69 ERA in the first 16 innings following his move to the bullpen. However, Sosa stumbled as a reliever in the final month of the season. His ERA in September was 6.57 in the 12 innings.\n2008.\nSosa began the season as a member of the Mets bullpen. His late 2007 struggles as a reliever continued, as Sosa allowed 17 earned runs in 21.2 innings pitched. On May 13, a day after giving up 4 earned runs in one inning against the Washington Nationals, Sosa was designated for assignment by the New York Mets. On May 21, Sosa was released.\nOn May 28, Sosa signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros, but was released in July. On July 25, he signed another minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners, and was assigned to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.\nOn August 22, Jorge was suspended 50 games by major league baseball for using an amphetamine that is used as a performance-enhancing drug.\n2009.\nOn December 18, 2008, Sosa signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. On September 8, 2009, the Nationals released Sosa.\n2010.\nOn January 15, 2010, Sosa signed a minor-league deal with the Boston Red Sox. He was later released and signed with the Florida Marlins. He was a member of the starting rotation for the AAA minor league affiliate of the Marlins, until he was promoted to the Marlins on July 21.\nNippon Professional Baseball.\n2012.\nSosa signed a one–year contract with the Chunichi Dragons on February 5, 2012. Sosa posted a 5-1 record with 4 saves and a 1.85 ERA during 2012.\n2013.\nSosa signed a contract with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars on December 26, 2012. Sosa started as a set-up man but was soon moved to the closer role after Shun Yamaguchi struggled. He posted a 3-4 record with 19 saves and a 1.79 ERA in 55 appearances."

After the 1997 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. His best college year was as a sophomore in which he had a team-leading .381 batting average and 63 RBI, with 15 home runs, second only to former Padres outfielder Jody Gerut on the team. After his excellent junior year in , Gall was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the 50th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. However, Gall elected to return to college for his senior year, and was eventually selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 11th round of the draft. He played in 3 College World Series and was All-Tournament Team in 1999 while hitting .611. He is the All-Time Pac-12 leader in hits and RBI's.\nProfessional career.\nAfter a season at Single-A ball, Gall played the season for the New Haven Ravens, the Double-A affiliate of the Cardinals at the time.

        "text": "Skeleton Canyon, called Cañon Bonita by the Mexicans, is located northeast of the town of Douglas, Arizona, in the Peloncillo Mountains, which straddle the modern Arizona and New Mexico state line, in the New Mexico Bootheel region.\nThis canyon connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico with the San Simon Valley of Arizona, and was once a main route between the United States and Mexico for both legal and illegal traffic. While originally known as Guadalupe Canyon, the area became called Skeleton Canyon, as a result of the bones of cows and humans left behind from cattle drives from Mexico.\nBattles.\nThe canyon was the site of several battles during the American Old West. In 1879, a group of outlaw Cowboys attacked a group of Mexican Rurales and stole their cattle. In July 1881, Curly Bill Brocius attacked and killed about a dozen Mexican smugglers carrying silver and heading to the United States. In retribution, the Mexican government attacked and killed Newman Haynes Clanton and others as they were driving cattle through Guadalupe Canyon. In 1883, Apache Indians from Chihuahua's band surprised eight troopers of Troop D, Fourth Cavalry, killed three men, burned the wagons and supplies, and drove off forty horses and mules.\nGeronimo's surrender.\nGeronimo's final surrender to General Nelson A Miles on September 4, 1886, occurred at the western edge of this canyon. As the surrender site is now on private property, commemorative monument has been erected to the northwest along SR 80, where it intersects with Skeleton Canyon Road in Arizona, at geographic coordinates . The mouth of the canyon lies about to the southeast just west of the Arizona – New Mexico line.\nMurders and shootouts.\nOn November 4, 1889, Judson \"Comanche\" White was found dead in Skeleton Canyon after being killed by person or persons unknown; all his possession had been stolen as well.\nOn August 12, 1896, a shoot-out between the Christian gang and a posse resulted in the Skeleton Canyon shootout."

        "title": "Lithuania men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Lithuania men's national basketball team () represents Lithuania in international basketball competitions. They are controlled by the Lithuanian Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in Lithuania. Despite Lithuania's small size, with a population of less than 3 million, the country's devotion to basketball has made them a traditional force of the sport in Europe.\nThe Lithuanian national team won the last EuroBasket tournaments prior to World War II, in 1937 and 1939. The 1939 team was led by Frank Lubin, who helped popularize basketball in the country and was called the \"grandfather of Lithuanian basketball\". Following the country's annexation by the Soviet Union during the war, Lithuanian players frequently formed the core of the Soviet national team. The most prevalent example was the 1988 Olympic basketball gold medal-winning team, which got most of its scoring from four Lithuanians: Valdemaras Chomičius, Rimas Kurtinaitis, Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Arvydas Sabonis.\nAfter the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1990, the national team was resurrected. Lithuania won bronze medals at the first three Summer Olympics to include NBA players – 1992, 1996, and 2000 – in addition to finishing fourth in 2004 and 2008, and in eighth place in 2012. The Lithuanian national team won the EuroBasket for the third time in 2003, and also a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEarly teams (1920s).\nOn 13 December 1925 in the Latvian capital Riga, Lithuanians played their first international game against their neighbors. Given the Latvians had international knowledge provided by coaches of the American YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association), they easily won 41–20. Later on, Latvians were crushing the future three-times European champions Lithuanians as well (41–29 or even 123–10). Another game the following year was won by the Latvians 47–12. During the period, basketball saw its Lithuanian popularity decrease and get overshadowed by football. The cold climate and lack of suitable indoor arena only allowed for basketball to be played during the summer period, and even then those who practiced preferred other sports.\nLithuanian Americans build a squad (1930s).\nThings started to improve in 1934, when the Physical Culture Palace was opened in Kaunas, featuring a spacious hall with 200 seats and cork floor built for tennis that was suitable for indoor basketball. In 1935, Lithuania decided to promote a World Lithuanian Congress in temporary capital Kaunas, inviting ethnic Lithuanians from many countries to unite the Lithuanian culture. The following year, a delegation of Lithuanian American athletes from Chicago arrived in Kaunas as participants of World Lithuanian Congress. Two of the players, Juozas \"Joseph\" Zukas and Konstantinas \"Konnie\" Savickus, stayed to teach basketball secrets to Lithuanians and be a part of the national team. Savickus in particular became a player-coach, and while the national team had just been trounced by inaugural European champions Latvia 123–10, one year later, with Savickus leading the team and exploiting stalling techniques, Lithuania trailed only 14–7 at halftime before losing 31–10.\nIn 1936, Lithuania applied to become a member of FIBA and take part in international basketball competitions, including EuroBasket 1937, the second European basketball tournament that the Latvia Basketball Association as reigning champions would host in Riga. While Savickus had returned to America, another descendant of Lithuanians would arrive to aid the country's basketball rise. Frank Lubin, who won a gold medal at the first basketball Olympic tournament at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, was invited to visit the Baltic nation by a Lithuanian official in attendance. Going by the Lithuanian name Pranas Lubinas, he spent five months there and served as the country's first knowledgeable coach, helping spread various basketball techniques. Lubinas, along with Zukas, helped the Lithuanians beat the Latvians for the first time, 35 to 27.\nThe preparations for the EuroBasket 1937 started slowly, with players training only 4 hours a week. At first, it was decided that the national team at the tournament would not include any Lithuanian Americans; however the decision was reversed with only one month remaining, once a Latvian newspaper had printed an extensive article about the second European championship considering Lithuania the weakest of all contestants. Lithuanian player Leonas Baltrūnas was shocked at the article and along with journalist Jonas Narbutas, used a translated version of it to request the inclusion of Lithuanian Americans to Vytautas Augustauskas, director of the Physical Culture Palace. After a telegram was sent to the US, two players arrived one month prior to the tournament, Pranas Talzūnas and Feliksas Kriaučiūnas, the latter of whom was designated as player-coach. To keep secrecy on how Lithuanian Americans were strengthening the team, all preparation games were cancelled and instead prolonged training sessions before the trip to Riga were held behind closed doors. The national team was being prepared not only technically, but also physically. Even once the reinforcements were made public, opponents were skeptic, with Talzūnas later remembering other teams felt he and Kriaučiūnas were not quality players as \"everyone thought that a good player must be tall, raising his hand and dunking into the basket.\".\nThe efforts were successful – the Lithuanians became the champions of Europe for the first time, defeating all their opponents and with Talzūnas being picked as the tournament's most valuable player. Following the final victory over Italy, the famous Lithuanian tenor Kipras Petrauskas even interrupted his performance at the State Theatre to joyfully announce the triumph of the national basketball team. The crowd then rose to their feet and together sang the Lithuanian anthem. The team returned to a warm reception, with thousands gathering at a train station in a way Kriaučiūnas compared to \"like we, here in America, greet the president.\" Basketball regained its ground immediately, and had its popularity rise abruptly, especially among students. Gymnasium teams from almost all counties competed in student games, teams were assembled in firms and basketball courts appeared all around the country. According to future player Stepas Butautas, \"In every yard hoops are being made from barrels. Children, teenagers are throwing balls into them, others – even a sock crammed with clouts. Our Veršvai Primary School teacher K. Požemecka built two poles, made hoops from a willow and said: 'We will play basketball'.\" Future team coach Vladas Garastas added that \"as kids we started using a barrel to make a hoop. We didn't have a ball, we stuffed in grass or whatever we could find\".\nLithuania was granted the right to organize the EuroBasket 1939. In addition, the Kaunas Sports Hall, Europe's first dedicated basketball arena, was built. In the competition, the team roster mostly consisted of Lithuanian Americans, with five American-born players: the returning Feliksas Kriaučiūnas (Chicago), Juozas Jurgėla (Chicago), Vytautas Budriūnas (Waukegan), Mykolas Ruzgys and Pranas Lubinas (Glendale). As a result, there were several protests from other nations. Lubinas, who was the designated player-coach, lead Lithuania to a second continental title, even scoring the buzzer-beater in the decisive game against Latvia, which warranted a 37–36 victory.\nAfter the restoration of independence (from 1990).\nAfter Lithuania's independence was restored, the country wanted to stand on its own in the basketball community again, complete with the standout players from the 1988 Soviet squad – Sabonis, Marčiulions, Chomičius and Kurtinaitis – expressing a desire to represent Lithuania. The National Olympic Committee of Lithuania (LTOK) and Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF) were restored, Lithuanian athletes withdrew its athletes from all Soviet national competitions, and both Sabonis and Marčiulions refused a request to play for the Soviet Union during the 1990 Goodwill Games. In 1991, the International Olympic Committee welcomed Lithuania back to its ranks in September, and in December, LKF president Stanislovas Stonkus attended the FIBA congress in Springfield, Massachusetts, and requested the right to be a full member of FIBA once again. FIBA president George E. Killian granted Stonkus' request and invited Lithuania to participate in all of the FIBA organized events. Sabonis and his agent started looking for Lithuanian-born or descended players, sending phone calls and faxes over Europe and North America.\nHowever, Lithuania's economic transition left the country in a difficult financial situation, and LKF could hardly count on state funding. As a result, the team had to search for the financial supporters by themselves in order to play internationally. Šarūnas Marčiulionis had experience and contacts in the United States from being the first USSR player in the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors. Consequently, he, along with Donnie Nelson (son of Marčiulionis' then-coach Don Nelson), searched for financial supporters that could finance Lithuania's participation in the international games and the 1992 Summer Olympics. George Shirk wrote a story about this on the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", and once American rock band Grateful Dead read the newspaper, they decided to help the team. Drummer Mickey Hart added that the story resonated with the bandmembers for being \"a struggle for life, liberty and freedom.\" The bandmembers donated $5,000 to Marčiulionis, and helped launch a tie-dyed jerseys trade that would feature Lithuania's national colors and the iconic, trademarked 'Slam-Dunking Skeleton' created by N.Y. artist Greg Speirs. The skeleton dunking a flaming basketball, nicknamed \"Skully\", was the artist's interpretation of how the Lithuanian team rose from the ashes to victory. The artist's profits would be passed onto the Lithuania national basketball team and a fund for Lithuanian children. The Lithuanians were favourable to the garish shirts because, according to Nelson, it was a great contrast to \"all those years of those Soviet colors, nothing but blues and grays\". Arvydas Sabonis even said that \"My first impression of [the jerseys] was: Wow, this really is a free Lithuania\". The skeleton, nicknamed \"Skully\", was enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame, being the only cartoon character to be enshrined in any sports Hall of Fame. New versions of the Skully jerseys were featured in the following two Olympic Games.\nTo assume the head coach position, American Dan Peterson, then in Italy, was invited but declined. BC Žalgiris manager Raimundas Sargunas became coach, but problems with the players made him demoted to assistant, a job shared with Donnie Nelson and Spanish Javier Imbroda, who was invited following Sabonis' suggestion of a Liga ACB veteran. The eventual choice was Vladas Garastas, another Žalgiris veteran who was assistant in the 1988 Soviet squad.\n1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.\nPreparation for Lithuania's first major international tournament since regaining independence began in May 1992, as it was the first time a squad of players mostly playing outside the country could get together and train. While missing Sabonis, Marčiulionis and Artūras Karnišovas, Lithuania competed in the eight-teams Nordic Countries Championship. They took the second place there, losing only to the well-known opponents Latvia 80–95 in the final. Standout players included Gintaras Krapikas (22.5 points per game) and Rimas Kurtinaitis (19 points).\nAfterwards, the country celebrated 70 years of Lithuanian basketball, and among the events was a competition featuring two Lithuanian teams, Latvia, Belarus, Finland, and Illinois State University basketball team. The superiority of the Lithuanians, now counting with Sabonis and Marčiulionis, made them handily beat the opponents. Following it, Lithuania national team was invited to compete in the prestigious annual Acropolis Tournament hosted by Greece, along with Italy and France. Lithuanians began the competition shockingly, immediately crushing the EuroBasket 1991 silver medalists Italians 116–94 (at one point leading by 87–49). Though, then they narrowly lost to the host Greece squad 81–83 and after easily defeating the French squad 109–78, took the second place. Despite not winning the cup, this was a perfect first major international challenge for the Lithuania national team, giving the solid hopes of success for the newly reborn state. Shortly before the opening of the Olympic Games, Lithuanians also overcame the Olympics host Spain 107–97 in Ibiza.\nLithuania was among the many European independent states that due to the dissolutions of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, would return to the Olympic competition for the 1992 games. For the 1992 Pre-Olympic Basketball Tournament, held in Spain from 22 June to 5 July, Lithuania was joined by the debuting Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia, and Estonia, along with the non-Baltic Soviet republics in a Commonwealth of Independent States. The latter was a particularly awaited adversary for the Lithuanians, as according to LTOK president Artūras Poviliūnas, \"We have dreamed all of our lives about playing against the Soviet Union. Although it's not called the Soviet Union any more, this game will be very important and very symbolic. It will be as important as the Olympics themselves.\" With a trip funded by the Spanish city of Melilla, Lithuania managed to get one of the four qualifying spots disputed by 25 participants, winning all their 11 games in the tournament.\nThe Olympic tournament for the Lithuania national team began against China, with an overwhelming 112–75 win that featured 31 points by Rimas Kurtinaitis (5 of 6 three-pointers). Afterwards a tough match with FIBA Americas silver medalist Venezuela had the lead frequently changing, with Lithuania depending on Marčiulionis (27 points) and Sabonis (24) to win by 87–79. The third game was easier, with the Lithuanians beating Puerto Rico 104–91, with 80 points scored by the \"golden trio\" Sabonis, Marčiulionis, and Kurtinaitis. Then awaited the hardest adversary in the group stage, the former USSR states in an Unified Team. Lithuania managed to beat the team during the qualifying tournament, and during the Olympics even got a 59–57 lead at the second quarter. Then the Unified Team managed to overcome its defector state and win 92–80, despite the 42-points combined efforts of Sabonis and Marčiulionis. In order to qualify for the quarter-finals, the Lithuania national team had to overcome the Australian squad. Lithuanians lost the first half 45–46, though later they mightily grabbed the lead till the end of the game, winning it 98–87 and qualifying in second place for the playoffs.\nLithuania met the respected and powerful Brazilian squad at the quarter-finals. The coaching staff decided to use only the most reliable players, with only six Lithuanians scoring. The tense game had the Brazilians leading at half-time, and Lithuania only taking full advantage with five minutes remaining: from 87 to 83, the score built up to a 114–96 Lithuanian wins. Sabonis played all the 40 game minutes and scored 32 points, while Marčiulionis added 29, and Kurtinaitis 20.\nAt the semi-final Lithuanians met the United States squad nicknamed \"Dream Team\". It was the first time the Americans brought a team composed of NBA players, including the widely regarded all-time greatest basketballer Michael Jordan, and the superiority of the \"Dream Team\" left the Lithuanians absolutely no chances for victory, with the Baltic state taking a lopsided 76–127. It is still the biggest loss ever suffered by the Lithuanian squad, who scored only 34.2% of their shots. The Americans still recognized that they aimed to ramp up their game specially to counter the Lithuanians, with Larry Bird acknowledging that \"we knew the Lithuanians were capable of scoring, (so) we didn't take them lightly\", and Magic Johnson saying that \"they're a dangerous team, so we had to pick up our intensity, play better defense\". Afterwards, the Lithuanian team coaches decided to start resting the primary players for the bronze medals game.\nAt the bronze medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team for the third time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that \"We lost to them once already, we couldn't let that happen again. The final had to be ours\", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that \"We didn't have any choice, we absolutely had to win at any cost\". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying \"Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania. Forget about your personal ambitions. People are watching you, losing sleep over you\". Šarūnas Marčiulionis: \"Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game\". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable for a tiny country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer. Marčiulionis played 40 minutes during that match and scored 29 points, while Sabonis added 27. Donnie Nelson described the locker room as \"like winning the NBA championship times five\". After the bronze medal victory, \"de jure\" Head of State Vytautas Landsbergis visited the team at the locker room, and they all sung the national anthem.\nDuring the awarding ceremony, Lithuanians decided to dress up the colorful Skeleton Jerseys in order to show their newly reborn country national colors and to show their gratitude to Greg Speirs and the Grateful Dead for their financial support. Rimas Kurtinaitis characterized the emotional awarding ceremony by saying: \"Well, we cried. It was really from joy. Words cannot even express feelings like that. You need to be there\". Valdemaras Chomičius: \"It was such an emotion that it's hard to explain. You have to experience it\". Arvydas Sabonis by comparing his 1988's Olympic gold medal and the 1992's Olympic bronze medal said: \"The medal in Seoul was gold, but this bronze is our soul\". In all, Lithuanians averaged 94 points per game in the tournament, being outclassed only by the USA (117 points per game). The team was the subject of a 2012 documentary by Marius Markevičius, \"The Other Dream Team\".\nEuroBasket 1995.\nDuring the qualifiers for EuroBasket 1993, Lithuanian basketball had its biggest disappointment. Missing Arvydas Sabonis but still with most of the bronze medal squad, Lithuania played in a three team group in Wrocław, and beat hosts Poland but lost to Belarus, being eliminated by the fellow former United Republic. It remains Lithuania's only absence following independence. However, this fiasco encouraged the creation of the first professional basketball league in Lithuania.\nTo get into EuroBasket 1995 in Greece, the Lithuanians had to go through a two-stage qualifying tournament in 1993. In 10 games, Lithuania only lost twice, to Ukraine in Vienna and Slovenia in Ljubljana. With their spot guaranteed, Lithuania started its preparations in 1995 by playing in several international competitions, winning a four-team tournament in Málaga. The last game was a friendly with the Polish in Vilnius, winning 105–84.\nIn its return to the European championship following years under Soviet occupation, Lithuania began the tournament powerfully, with five wins in the group stage and a defeat to Yugoslavia. They overcame the quarter-finals stage successfully as well, defeating 1994 World Championship silver medalists Russia 82–71, leading the game from start to finish. With a guaranteed spot in the tournament's top four, Lithuania was granted the right to participate in the 1996 Summer Olympics, held in Atlanta. The semi-final hurdle was overcome as well with a 90–80 defeat of the powerful Croatia, led by the two mighty centers: Stojko Vranković and Dino Rađa. The Lithuanian national team advanced into its final after 56 years, demonstrating the Lithuanian basketball's vitality and strength, in spite of all the previous difficulties.\nThe final was a rematch with Yugoslavia. The tense finale, where Lithuania had the support of the home crowd as the Serbs had eliminated Greece, had Lithuania winning the close first half, 49–48. With five minutes remaining, Arvydas Sabonis fouled out, as the Lithuanians were behind 76–83, later closing to 83–84. With Yugoslavia leading 87–83, Saulius Štombergas made a shot that was ruled out as the referee George Toliver called an offensive foul. Lithuanians protested the decision and received three technical fouls (first Sabonis, then Marčiulionis and then the whole team), leading them to leave the court in protest, only returning when persuaded by the Serbs. Aleksandar Đorđević, the game's overall top scorer with 41 points, scored all three free-throws. Lithuania eventually lost the game 90–96. After the final whistle, Greek fans shouted \"Lithuania is the champion\" and booed Yugoslavia during the medal ceremony, which also had the third-placed Croatians leaving for the Yugoslavs – who were still waging a war against Croatia. Marčiulionis, who was named tournament MVP, later stated that \"we felt robbed and we still feel that\", while acknowledging that despite the questionable refereeing, the silver medal came due to a lack of depth in the Lithuanian bench along with the Yugoslavs knowing \"how to provoke other players and initiate psychological battles\".\n1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics.\nIn preparation for another Olympic tournament, Lithuania played five games in Australia against the \"Australian Boomers\", with a team composed mostly of young players as veterans Sabonis, Marčiulionis, and Karnišovas were unable to participate. Lithuania lost the entire series, but the experience against Australia would be useful in the future. Once they returned to Europe, the Lithuanians played a few games in Spain, losing twice to strong and spirited Croatia and beating twice Africa champions Angola. Once Sabonis returned for a friendly with Yugoslavia in Germany, he scored 32 points in Lithuania's win by 86–70.\nThe Lithuanian basketball started well its second Olympiad, beating 1992 Olympic vice-champions Croatia – led by Toni Kukoč, Stojko Vranković, and Dino Rađa – 83–81 in a tough match with two overtimes. Exhausted and facing an Argentinian team focused on adversary slowdown, Lithuania lost its second game 61–65. Facing the host United States supported by 31,000 spectators, Lithuania suffered the absence of an injured Marciulionis and lesser contributions by Sabonis and Kurtinaitis, and lost 82–104. However, wins in the final games against Angola (85–49) and China (116–55) qualified Lithuania at second place.\nThe Olympic quarter-final game had Lithuania crushing its third straight adversary against Greece, 99–66. The Olympic semi-final match awaited with powerhouse Yugoslavia, undefeated that far and inspiring the Lithuanians to avenge the 1995 EuroBasket final. They began the game with the lead of 18–9, though Yugoslavians won the quarter 35–31. With the five minutes remaining, Lithuanians had the lead of 54–51, then the game tied (58–58); however, during the last three match minutes Lithuanians scored none, losing the game 58–66. Another chance of an Olympic final was lost.\nOnly the game for the second consecutive bronze remained for the Lithuanian squad, against the Australians who sought their first Olympic medal. Lithuanians were exhausted after the tedious semi-final, and the game remained tight, with the lead never getting over 8 points and the score at 73–72 with one minute remaining. Still, a three-point shot by Arvydas Sabonis with 30 seconds remaining helped Lithuania retain advantage, eventually triumphing 84–74. Sabonis was the driving force of the bronze medal game, neutralizing defender Mark Bradtke on the way to 30 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists and 5 blocks. Another Olympic medal proved Lithuania was among the top basketball countries. The game marked the last time Sabonis and Marčiulionis played together, as the latter retired from the national team, and also the final match with head coach Vladas Garastas. A generational change was to come.\nEuroBasket 1997.\nWhile selecting its squad for the 30th European Championship in Barcelona, Lithuania retained only two primary players from the 1995 silver medalists: Artūras Karnišovas and Gintaras Einikis. The so-called \"golden generation\" was replaced by up-and-coming youngsters such as Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Dainius Adomaitis, Virginijus Praškevičius, and Eurelijus Žukauskas. Furthermore, Jonas Kazlauskas took over as coach. The newly put together team was constantly causing anxiety if it would keep up with previous successful performances by Lithuanians. Hopes were restored once Lithuania won a four-team tournament in Riga and beat Spain in Zaragoza.\nThe EuroBasket 1997 championship had extra significance for Lithuania as it gave qualifying spots for the 1998 FIBA World Championship, held in Athens, Greece. Lithuania managed to win all games in the group stage, albeit struggling with both Israel – who lead at halftime by 30–31, but wound up losing 75–60 – and France – who managed to take the lead thrice before bowing down to Lithuania 94–88 – before an easy 76–67 defeat of Slovenia. The second round lead to tougher times to the Lithuanians, winning only against Turkey while losing to Greece and Russia. The poor performance lead them to face defending champions Yugoslavia, who beat Lithuania 75–60 on the way to another title.\nDue to the poor performance in the second round, Lithuanians were forced to take on the terrific Yugoslavia national team (the upcoming champions) in the quarterfinals, losing 60–75. With only the consolation tournament left, Lithuania crushed the Polish squad 76–55, but lost to the host team Spain during the final seconds, 93–94. The final standing of sixth was enough for a World Championship spot, and helped the young Lithuanian team to lay the foundations for the future victories.\nFIBA World Championship 1998.\nAs usually, by preparing for the significant championship, the Lithuania national team played a wide variety of games and tournaments. A small championship in Nicosia, Cyprus, had Lithuania beating Nigeria before losing to the upcoming world championship host Greece 68–82. A friendly with Spain in Seville had the Lithuanians defeated, 62–66. Lithuania also participated in the 1998 Goodwill Games basketball tournament in New York City, along with the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Russia and Puerto Rico. In the first round, the Lithuania national team overcame Russia and Argentina, but lost to Australia and took the second spot in the group. Consequently, they had to play the United States in the semi-final, losing it 76–89. Though, they took third place after smashing the Puerto Ricans 119–75.\nDebuting in its first FIBA World Championship with a young roster, the Lithuania national team was determined to cause a good impression. The team went undefeated in the group stage, crushing South Korea 97–56 before beating a United States team lacking the NBA elite due to a lockout (84–82), and a close defeat of Brazil, 66–62. The second round was tougher for Lithuania, who lost to Australia 61–71, and despite beating Argentina 84–75, wound up losing in overtime to Spain, 80–86. A quarterfinal against Russia ensued, and while the Lithuanians had beaten them two weeks before and lead the game 38–35 at halftime, the Russians beat the inexperienced team by 82–67. Following the consolation tournament with a loss to Italy and a win over Argentina, Lithuania finished in seventh place. The equal games and especially the victory over the United States were promising for the young Lithuanian squad.\nEuroBasket 1999.\nPreparation for the European championship began in a usual way: after intense practicing, the Lithuanians participated in minor competitions, winning two tournaments (in Helsinki and Kaunas), to go to the European championship with elation.\nLithuania qualified for EuroBasket 1999 in France losing only two out of ten games, to Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tournament started with a surprise, as an underdog Czech Republic beat Lithuania 78–62. Afterwards, the team found its stride and won the five following games in the first and second rounds. Reaching the knockout rounds, Lithuanians were favorites against Spain, but lost by a close 74–72 score. Two wins in the consolation tournament gave Lithuania the fifth place and a qualifying spot for the 2000 Summer Olympics. EuroBasket 1999 was the last time the Lithuanian national team counted with Arvydas Sabonis and Artūras Karnišovas. Though, the solid performances by the young Saulius Štombergas and Šarūnas Jasikevičius gave a bright outset for their future.\n2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.\nLithuania started the 2000s by beating Turkey 70–58 in Vilnius. During the preparation period Lithuanians once again visited Spain, defeating the hosts in two preparatory tournaments.\nThe 2000 Olympic tournament marked another time of renovation for Lithuania. The only veterans, Saulius Štombergas and Eurelijus Žukauskas, were reserves in Atlanta, while eight players were debutants: Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Darius Songaila, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Mindaugas Timinskas, Andrius Giedraitis, Kęstutis Marčiulionis, Darius Maskoliūnas and Tomas Masiulis. The coaching staff was also inexperienced in the Olympics aside from assistants Valdemaras Chomičius and Donnie Nelson.\nThe first Olympic game against Italy had both teams combined scoring less than 100 points, with Lithuania losing 48–50. The young Lithuanians managed to recover, beating upcoming Olympic vice-champions France 81–63. Journalist Roma Grinbergienė described the triumph symbolically and picturesquely: \"Even the Vytautas the Great would accolade!\". The third game, against the third incarnation of the United States \"Dream Team\", had the Lithuanians giving the Americans their toughest match since NBA players joined: the final score of 85–76 had Team USA's lowest point total and advantage with professionals, and the Lithuanians even got the lead in the second quarter. Onwards, Lithuania overcame China 82–66 and New Zealand 85–75, and finished third in their group.\nThe quarter-final opponent was one Lithuania could not defeat in previous years, Yugoslavia. The start was anxious as Lithuanians were trailing 8–2, but not for long. Yugoslavians resisted only until three minutes were left, with Lithuania already leading the game 72–58. Then nobody doubted – the quarter-final winner is Lithuania, officially winning the game 76–63. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas: \"Winning against the Yugoslavian team and its coach is every team and every coach dream. We are even more happy that we won in the quarter-final. The gulf is separating the quarter-final winner teams from the losers. We played very orderly, probably the most disciplined in this tournament. We defended well. Furthermore, Gintaras Einikis and Šarūnas Jasikevičius played amazingly\". Lithuania was to compete for another Olympic medal, to the happiness of all their fans.\nAlthough, the Lithuania national team coaches had no time to rejoice. The USA Dream Team was awaiting once again in the semi-final. Millions of the basketball fans were surprised there. The USA won the first quarter 48–36, but 5 minutes into the second Lithuania had tied 50–50. Then none of the teams allowed to advance any further for the each other. The main events were happening when there was only a bit less than 2 minutes remaining. When there was 1:36 left, the Lithuania was leading 80–79, then the game tied again (80–80). Ramūnas Šiškauskas got to shoot three free-throws, converting only one (81–80). Quickly Vince Carter gives back the advantage to the Americans, Kevin Garnett misses two free throws, and a successful US rebound leads Antonio McDyess to make Lithuania trail 81–84 with 25 seconds left. Šarūnas Jasikevičius makes two free-throws (83–84). Šiškauskas fouls with five seconds left. Jason Kidd converts only one free-throw (83–85). A last second long shot by Šarūnas Jasikevičius is an air ball, and the \"Dream Team\" managed its smallest victory ever with 85–83. Lithuania lost, but American coach Rudy Tomjanovich praised the adversary, stating that the Lithuanians \"played focused and played the high level basketball. At the end, they were unlucky to make a few free-throws.\" The United States also widely covered how the small nation nearly upset a team that seemed previously unbeatable in previous tournaments.\nFor the third time, only a bronze medal was possible for Lithuania. Despite the psychological damage of the defeat and having to face hosts Australia in the third place match, the Lithuanians played well enough to win again. Having the experience of playing the Boomers earlier in the year, Lithuania had a strong defensive strategy, and combined with a helped by a shooting percentage of 67%, never gave up the lead on the way to an 89–71 victory, winning their third consecutive Olympic bronze medal. Coach Kazlauskas was happy with the result, given the squad was young and \"didn't let down the lath lower than it was raised.\"\nEuroBasket 2001.\nThe start of a new millennium. Another European Championship, held in Turkey, awaited Lithuania in the autumn. While most of the 2000 roster was returning, many up-and-coming stars such as Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Darius Songaila, Rimantas Kaukėnas and Robertas Javtokas would make their debut. To prepare for the championship and give international experience to the young players, Lithuania participated in many prestigious competitions in Europe and South America. In Braunschweig, Germany, Lithuania achieved the third place among the four very capable teams (Yugoslavia, France and Germany). Then the Lithuanian squad played for the first time in South America, taking part in a four team tournament in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires. Lithuania won two games, including its 500th international victory against Brazil (the last 100 in just 4 years), but only finished second after losing to the hosts Argentina 56–67. Lithuania also competed in the Acropolis Tournament for the second time after nine years, this time losing twice and finished fourth.\nEuroBasket 2001 ended as an unexpected failure to Lithuania. The group stage started with two victories, 82–60 over Ukraine and 68–59 with Israel, before losing to France 65–76. A match against fellow Balts Latvians would give a spot in the knockout stages. And there Lithuania suffered an unexpected and overwhelming defeat to the Latvians, 64–94. By falling so early, Lithuania lost all the chances of participating in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and was threatened to miss the next EuroBasket as well. The disappointment made head coach Jonas Kazlauskas resign.\nEuroBasket 2003.\nDue to the fiasco in EuroBasket 2001, Lithuania did not have a direct spot on EuroBasket 2003, held in Sweden, and had to take part in the qualification tournament in 2002. They easily granted a ticket into the continental championship tournament, winning all 10 qualifying games.\nThe renewed Lithuania basketball team, full of motivation and energy, that would go to Sweden, was led by Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Arvydas Macijauskas, Ramūnas Šiškauskas and Saulius Štombergas. Again preparations lead to friendlies and international tournaments, losing only to France and Spain in their respective countries. EuroBasket itself opened against neighbour Latvia, responsible for the painful 2001 elimination. The game, once again, was going remarkably poorly for Lithuania. They firmly lost the first quarter (14–23), remained trailing by halftime (34–40) and only managed to tie by the third (58–58). At the fourth quarter, Latvians still had the lead of 66–58, when with 23 seconds remaining, Eurelijus Žukauskas tied the game (81–81) and forced overtime. The extra period had Lithuania guarantee a 92–91 victory with four seconds to go, after Šarūnas Jasikevičius made two free-throws. Despite the difficult start, then Lithuanians showed a much improved game in the following group stage matches, overcoming Israel (94–62) and Germany (93–71).\nConcerns were raised once defending World and European champions Serbia and Montenegro (former Yugoslavia) were set as the quarterfinal opponents. The Lithuanians still prevailed, already achieving a 30–19 advantage in the first quarter (30–19), and never giving any chances in a 98–82 victory. Serbian coach Božidar Maljković followed the match by saying that \"Lithuania plays the best team-play in this championship. The victory over Serbia was a splendid result achieved by the tremendous players, capable of playing like a sustainable derivative. &lt;...&gt; Lithuanians are playing fast, interesting and tactically matured basketball. The game is the best I have observed in this championship. By game-play, Lithuania is only worth gold\".\nSemi-finals against France were next. Lithuanians won the first three quarters, and then in the last one the French squad came in ahead (60–58), and were leading by 70–65 with three minutes remaining. More struggles later, Lithuania were ahead, 72–70, with 15 seconds remaining. A final attack by the French NBA star Tony Parker was stopped by Ramūnas Šiškauskas, who added two more free throw points and gave the Neman river nation their fourth EuroBasket final ever, as well as an automatic spot in the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nExhausted by the game versus France, the Lithuanians still had to prove themselves in the final against Spain. And while the first quarter was played equally (20–19), afterwards the Lithuanians dominated and never gave the Spanish any chance. Lithuania won their third European title 93–84 after a 64-year hiatus. Šarūnas Jasikevičius was named MVP, and was included along with Saulius Štombergas in the All-Tournament Team.\nThe word about the Lithuanians triumph spread wide. The defeated Spanish of \"El Mundo\" considered that \"the good Spanish mood, accuracy and the joy of the game evaporated in front of the Lithuania national team victory desire\", and \"El Periódico de Catalunya\" added that \"when Lithuania was leading 62–48, what the Spanish players wished the most was to end the game and to head into the locker rooms just to finish this suffering.\" In Italy, \"Tuttosport\" described the victorious squad as \"a true Lithuania national team. Without NBA stars.\", while \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" noted how \"there is no other country in the Old Europe which would love the venerable, precious basketball more.\"\nThe ten-year anniversary of the title was celebrated on 14 September 2013, at Žalgiris Arena. The EuroBasket 2003 winners, except for Kšyštof Lavrinovič and Giedrius Gustas, played a friendly game against a team of European stars, most of whom were also in that tournament. The Lithuanians led by Arvydas Macijauskas won 85:68.\n2004 Athens Summer Olympics.\nIn preparation for the Olympics, Lithuania lost to Italy twice while defeating France, Greece and Czech Republic along the way. The most impressive victory in the preparation for the games was achieved in the traditional Acropolis Tournament, where the Lithuanians managed to become champions in their fourth appearance, with wins over Italy and Brazil and a defeat to the host Greece. Lithuania also finished second in the six-team Golden Ball competition held in Belgrade, losing to the home team of Serbia. The last preparation games were two matches in Spain, and a win against Sweden in Vilnius.\nFor the fourth post-independence Olympics, basketball captain Saulius Štombergas was given the honor to bear the Lithuanian flag during the opening ceremony. The Olympic basketball for Lithuania started slowly, laboring to a victory against the African champions Angola 78–63, with their opponents shooting an excellent 52% from the three-point line. Lithuanian national team also had difficulties with Puerto Rico, depending on a high average of three-pointers to beat the NBA-heavy squad by 98–90. Then Lithuanians, in front of 12,000 spectators, achieved revenge against their Greek hosts, defeating them 98–76. The next match would be against the United States, which again featured major NBA stars such as Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, and LeBron James, but had already been proven as faltering following a defeat to Puerto Rico. Lithuania managed to beat the United States 94–90, only the fourth defeat by the Americans in the Olympic stage. Jasikevičius, who had lost a possible buzzer beater against the Dream Team four years before, managed to score 28 points, including a decisive 10-point barrage in 69 seconds that gave Lithuania the lead in the final minutes. While the fifth game, versus Australia, was not significant for the group standings as the Lithuanians had already secured the first spot in the group, the Lithuanians still won 100–85, maintaining their good run.\nIn the quarter-finals Lithuanians easily swept China 95–75, successfully qualifying for the semi-finals. The familiar Italian team awaited in the semi-finals. Lithuania started well, winning the first quarter 29–17, and leading 34–23 in the second. However, the Italians managed to take the lead before half time and a close game ensued. Lithuanians were able to tie the game in the third quarter (53–53) and even take the lead in the fourth (78–73); however, at the buzzer the Italians celebrated a 91–100 victory, shattering the Lithuanian dream of Olympic gold.\nSeeking a fourth bronze medal, Lithuania would again face the United States. The game was a close affair, with the lead changing hands nine times and both teams attempting as many three-point shots as possible (Lithuania converted 21 of their 37 shots, and the United States had 8 out of 18). At half time, the United States were ahead 49–44, after the third quarter they maintained their advantage 74–71. In the final quarter, Lithuania closed in to 83–82 in the 34th minute, before the Americans took their stand and kept the lead to the end, winning the match 104–96 and leaving the Lithuanians without Olympic medals for the first time.\nEuroBasket 2005.\nEuroBasket 2005 in Serbia and Montenegro would feature many absences in the Lithuanian squad, such as Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Saulius Štombergas, Arvydas Macijauskas, and Donatas Slanina. Though, the team had Ramūnas Šiškauskas, one of the biggest European stars of that time. For preparation, the Lithuanian team attended tournaments in Europe, Asia and Australia, being represented in some of them by the reserve roster – such as in the 2005 Stanković Continental Champions' Cup in Beijing, which the Lithuanians won after defeating 4 of the 5 opponents. On 1 September 2005, a friendly with Ireland had Lithuania achieve the 600th victory in the team's history, 97–62 in Kaunas.\nStarting the tournament as defending champions, Lithuania proved their favoritism by beating Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria with solid differences and an average of 88 points. However, the knockout rounds had the team eliminated with an underwhelming performance, scoring only 47 points in a quarterfinal with France. National team coach Antanas Sireika said: \"We played the worst game in the championship and I think that the main reason of this is that the players failed to deal with the psychological tension. This is the main losing reason\". The only consolation was the remaining opportunity to qualify into the World Championship, which the Lithuanians achieved by beating Russia and Slovenia for fifth place. Lithuania won 5 of 6 games in the tournament. Consequently, the competition scheme was questioned in its reliability.\nFIBA World Championship 2006.\nThe 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan had Lithuania matching the seventh place from their 1998 debut, but many saw this performance as an under-achievement. Lithuania started the tournament with a narrow two-point loss to Turkey, followed by an overtime defeat to eventual finalists Greece which had Lithuania suffering 25 turnovers. Confidence was restored with wins over Qatar, Australia, and Brazil, that qualified Lithuania for the knockout rounds against Italy. They won the match by three points 71–68, although Arvydas Macijauskas fouled Gianluca Basile during a 3-point attempt in the dying seconds which gave Italy the chance to level the score, but all three free throws were missed. Lithuania lost the quarter-final match against eventual champions Spain by 22 points, conceding a total of 28 turnovers during the game. The consolation tournament began with another defeat: Lithuania lost a 12-point lead over Turkey in the last 3minutes of regulation, and the resulting overtime had Turkey achieving a 95–84 victory. Lithuania still won the seventh place match against Germany, 77–62. Sireika resigned soon after the championship. On 28 December 2006, Ramūnas Butautas, son of Stepas Butautas, was announced as the new coach of the team.\nEuroBasket 2007.\nEuroBasket 2007 in Spain held big responsibilities for Lithuania, that had to prove the failure in the previous continental tournament passed, while holding higher stakes for Olympic qualifying, restricted to only the medallists. The first international friendly of the year was played in the newly built Šiauliai Arena, the first time the Lithuanian team played in their \"Sun City\". Though, the debut ended up with a big surprise, as the visiting Swedish won 69–62. Further preparation games were variable for Lithuania as well, losing to Latvia and Spain as visitors while defeating Russia in Vilnius. A fifth Acropolis Tournament had Lithuania again getting second place after losing to the Greek hosts.\nLithuania started EuroBasket well, crushing both Turkey (86–69), and the Czech Republic (95–75) before a harder group closer with Germany. Dirk Nowitzki, who scored 28 points, helped the Germans cut a 17-point Lithuanian advantage at halftime to just four by the game's end (84–80). Lithuanians successfully qualified into the second stage.\nRound 2 had Lithuania winning much disputed games against Italy (79–74), and France (88–73), before a sweeping of Slovenia 80–61.\nThe quarter-finals had Lithuania against the traditional Croatia national team, which did not yield to the Lithuanians' superiority and even lead after the first and third quarters. An imposing fourth quarter had Lithuania achieving 74–72, completing seven straight victories en route to the semifinal.\nRussia was awaiting at the semi-finals. The Lithuanians, who had yet to defeat the Russians, failed to accomplish this again. After the first six minutes, the Russians had an 18–3 lead, which escalated to 33–14. However, the Lithuanians' resilience made them erase the deficit by the third quarter, 52–52. Eventually, fatigue that remained from the tough quarterfinal caugh up with Lithuania, especially playing against such a powerful adversary. The Russian won 86–74, despite the efforts of Lithuanian captain Ramūnas Šiškauskas, who scored 30 points. Following the game, Šarūnas Jasikevičius declared that: \"We have to forget everything and endeavor to win the medals. [...&gt;] The situation of the Greeks is the same as ours. They also painfully lost, they will wish to achieve the medals as well. We will give everything we got and we will try to win\".\nThe upcoming game had two prizes at stake, the European bronze – which Lithuania had never won, only three golds and two silvers – and the last direct spot for the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing. Lithuania managed to beat the Greeks 78–69. On 17 September, the players had a meeting ceremony in Vilnius to get state awards.\n2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\nWith the fifth straight Olympic tournament following independence ahead, the Lithuania national team started 2008 with a frustration. The Cleveland Cavaliers refused to release Žydrūnas Ilgauskas for the Games, even as the LKF managed to find financing for the NBA franchise's US$22 million insurance tax. During a press conference to announce his absence from the Games, Ilgauskas added that he was in pain from injuries he suffered during the 2007-08 NBA season, making the Cavaliers' medical staff recommend him go through immediate surgery. This event still causes backlash against the Cavaliers for Lithuanians, specially as Ilgauskas wound up never playing for his national team.\nPreparation for the tournament was slightly different this time: Lithuania did not compete in any tournaments, only playing friendlies. The only two defeats in nine games were against Spain and the United States. Again the Olympics opening ceremony had Lithuania's flagbearer being a basketball player, this time Šarūnas Jasikevičius.\nThe 2008 Olympic tournament started with a tough opponent, defending gold medalists Argentina. Lithuania lead for most of the game, only for the Argentinians to tie with 18 seconds remaining. A decisive play by Linas Kleiza gave the lead and the victory for Lithuanians 79–75. The second game against Asia representatives Iran had Lithuania surprisingly losing the first quarter 15–20, only to dominate afterwards for a handful 99–67. Though, then Lithuanians obviously shown their advantage, crushing them 99–67. Difficult victories over Russia (86–79, Lithuania's first FIBA victory over them) and Croatia (86–73) gave Lithuania a guaranteed first place spot in the group. Thus the team barely cared in the round 1 closer with Australia, suffering 25 turnovers and being smashed 75–106.\nThe deadly quarter-final had Lithuania against hosts China, in front of 18,000 spectators. With Chinese star Yao Ming well defended by Lithuania, the Balts crushed them 94–68 to advanced into the semi-finals.\nThough, again a tough semi-final awaited against defending world champions Spain. The victory value was huge: the dreamed Olympic final, guaranteed silver and a chance at gold, while also providing the opportunity to take back on the 66–91 shellacking during preparations. Both teams played at their best, with Spain compensating the absence of José Calderón to lead by the first quarter, only for Lithuania to dominate for the following two and having a minimal 74–73 advantage by the fourth. Then rising performances by Rudy Fernandez and Pau Gasol (9 and 7 points respectively) during the concluding quarter along with the Lithuanians' exhaustion and lack of big men input lead the Spanish to barely edge and win the semifinal 91–86. Head coach Ramūnas Butautas said that the team played well and there was no need to be disappointed.\nLithuania was for the fifth consecutive time at the Olympic bronze match, hoping to get their fourth medals against former Olympic champions Argentina. Though, the tough semifinal had the Lithuanians tired and emotionally distraught, which the experienced adversary took advantage despite not counting with injured star Manu Ginóbili. By the third quarter, the game seemed already lost as Lithuanians trailed 67–49. The reduction of the deficit in the fourth was not enough to prevent Lithuania from losing another third place game, 75–87. Still, five Olympic semifinals proved the Lithuanians were still one of the strongest basketball teams worldwide despite hailing from a small country.\nEuroBasket 2009.\nBefore EuroBasket 2009 in Poland, Lithuanian stars like Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Darius Songaila, Arvydas Macijauskas, Rimantas Kaukėnas and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas decided not to join the national team. In preparation, the national team took part in another Acropolis Tournament, finishing third by beating Russia and losing to Greece and Turkey.\nAfter huge losses in the team roster and point guard shortage, Lithuania started the tournament with a loss to Turkey (76–84). This was the first time in the 21st century that the Lithuanians began a championship with a defeat. Later Lithuanians disappointingly lost to Poland, and depended on a strong fourth quarter to beat Bulgaria. Finishing third in its group, Lithuania qualified for the second round. However, it already begun badly with a 23-point loss to Slovenia. Following this shocking loss, team's captain Robertas Javtokas, when asked about the team's future, said: \"I don't know what else we could promise. We must get straight or it is enough of promises. We must come as men with balls and not like kids. Otherwise, other teams will humiliate us again\". The team's game still not improved, with a defeat to Spain (70–84) diminishing the Lithuanians' chances to qualify for the quarter-finals, and a loss to Serbia eliminating the team outright, with the final standing being a measly 12th place. Coach Ramūnas Butautas took all responsibility for the fiasco and resigned. It is regarded as the worst Lithuania national team performance ever.\nFIBA World Championship 2010.\nOn 12 December 2009, Lithuania was granted a wild card to participate in the World Championship in Turkey the following year.\nLithuania started the tournament against New Zealand. After a tough first quarter, Lithuanians took control of the game and kept ahead by a comfortable lead, finishing 92–79. The second game was against Canada. After reducing a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter, Lithuanians finally gained a small lead towards the end of the game. Canada had a chance to win the game, but Jermaine Anderson's game winning three rimmed out at the last second and Lithuania celebrated their second victory 70–68. The next match was against the defending champion Spain, and after another comeback from an 18-point deficit, the Lithuanians won the upsetting game 76–73, Linas Kleiza's free-throws sealing the victory.\nAlready guaranteed in the knockout rounds, Lithuania faced the group's other undefeated team, France. The French quickly gained momentum in the first half and forced Lithuania to a double-digit deficit. However, in the second half, Lithuania deftly reduced the deficit and cruised past the French defense, outscoring them 45–25 to win the game 69–55 and take the group's leadership. The preliminary round ended with a perfect record as Lebanon was handily defeated 84–66.\nAfter sweeping China (78–67) in the eighth finals and crushing Argentina in a blowout game (104–85) in the quarterfinals, Lithuania lost to Team USA by 15 points. They captured the bronze medal after winning against Eurobasket's silver medalist Serbia 99–88. This was Lithuania's best World Championship result.\nEuroBasket 2011.\nAfter 72 years, Lithuania was again hosting the EuroBasket in 2011. The national team was under much pressure given both the expectations as hosts and the outstanding performance at the World Championship the year before. The team tried to combine future prospects and the past stars, but during the leading months, lost two of its starting players, Linas Kleiza and Jonas Mačiulis, due to knee injuries. During EuroBasket, Marijonas Petravičius was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism after three games played. Not only Petravičius had to miss the rest of the tournament, but the disease marked the end of his professional career.\nNumerous officials and other European basketball specialists and pundits found EuroBasket 2011 the best European tournament ever, particularly due to the Lithuanian enthusiasm for the sport. However, the Lithuanian team wound up underperforming, suffering an upset in the quarterfinals to Macedonia. The consolation playoffs led to a final standing of fifth place, giving Lithuania a spot at the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament for Men.\n2012 FIBA World Olympic qualifying tournament.\nTwenty years later, Lithuania had to go through a dedicated Olympic qualifier, held in July 2012 in Caracas, Venezuela. The top three teams would get spots at the 2012 Olympics basketball tournament.\nThe team started off the tournament with a convincing victory against Venezuela, followed by an upset to Nigeria the following day. With all three teams tied with one win and one loss, Venezuela wound up disqualified due to a lesser point difference. Afterwards, many incidents regarding the Lithuanian squad were rumored to be caused by disgruntled Venezuelans. These included a tank column near the training hall polluting the air during the Lithuanian team workout, a broken bus during the trip to the arena before the quarter-final game against Puerto Rico, and vanished jerseys and water during said match. Despite all that, Lithuania managed to defeat Puerto Rico in a dramatic game. In the semifinals, Lithuania crushed the Dominican Republic and thus qualified for the 2012 London Olympics.\n2012 London Summer Olympics.\nAfter dominating in the Qualifying Tournament, Lithuania had a tough time at the Olympics. The first game against Argentina turned into a fiasco, as the South Americans forced Lithuania into a double-digit deficit in the first half, and kept a comfortable lead in the second half to finish the game strong, 102–79. Luis Scola, who was held down to 13 points in the quarterfinal match against Lithuania two years ago at the World Championship, led Argentina with 32 points. Lithuania rebounded from the loss playing with Nigeria, which also served to avenge the only defeat in the Qualifying Tournament. Playing exemplary defense against the Nigerian bigs Al-Farouq Aminu and Ike Diogu, Lithuania handily won 72–53. Next was another defeat, as France rode Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to win the game 74–82. The following game was against USA, which had just broke recordswith their 156–73 blowout of Nigeria. Right from the beginning, Lithuania proved to be a tough opponent for Team USA, with Linas Kleiza scoring 25 points, and former Duke player Martynas Pocius having 7 rebounds and 6 assists. The Lithuania were down by only 4 points at the half and 6 at the end of the third quarter. In the final quarter, Lithuania momentarily took the lead 84–82, but lost it again as LeBron James scored 9 points in 4 minutes to achieve a 94–99 win. ESPN's Marc Stein reacted to the near-defeat remembering the other struggle the \"Dream Team\" had with Lithuania in 2000, and adding that even if it was \"the weakest Lithuanian team they've ever faced in Olympic basketball competition, a limited Lithuania is still Lithuania. Still stubborn. Still dangerous. Still causing a variety of problems for USA Basketball.\"\nDespite its third loss in the tournament, Lithuania still had a chance to qualify to the knockout rounds by defeating Tunisia, which they did 63–76. Thus, Lithuania had the final spot in the quarterfinals, facing the other group's leader, Russia. While the Russians never left the lead, Lithuania always kept it close, and by the fourth quarter was just one point behind. Still their attempts for an upset fell short, and ended up losing 74–83, making it the first time Lithuania missed the Olympic semifinal. Veterans Rimantas Kaukėnas, Darius Songaila and Šarūnas Jasikevičius scored half of the team's points in that game. Later in an interview, Jasikevičius said that he expected the younger players from the World Championship to carry the team, but the opposite happened. Songaila and Kaukėnas agreed, and all three retired from the national team after the tournament. On 1 October, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation brought Jonas Kazlauskas back after 12 years to replace Kęstutis Kemzūra.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nEven before EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia started, the Lithuanian team had problems: their flight on 2 September was cancelled due to airplane problems, forcing them to delay their flight until the next day, and miss their first morning workout in Podmežakla Hall. Just one day later, Lithuania played their first game against Serbia. Unable to defend Serbian star Nenad Krstić, who dominated the game with 20 points and 9 rebounds, Lithuania lost 63–56. The second game against Macedonia had many expectations, as Lithuania wanted to avenge getting upset at home in the previous tournament. Through effective defense of Bo McCalebb, the Lithuanians could get their first victory with 75–67. Two tough games followed, against fellow Balts Latvia (67–59), and Montenegro in overtime (77:70), due to Kšyštof Lavrinovič, who only scored 2 points during his first three matches, rising up to score 24 points. The group stage ended against Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose star Mirza Teletović scored 31 points and fantastic three-pointers to beat the Lithuanians 72–78, who still managed to qualify to the second round with crucial three-pointers by Linas Kleiza.\nSecond round started against defending vice-champions France, which forced Lithuania into solid defense – especially against Tony Parker – to win the game 76–62. Then Lithuanians easily crushed Belgium 86–67, and narrowly defeated Ukraine with 70–63. The knockout round wound begin against Italy, which Lithuania beat by 81–77. The semifinals with Croatia had Jonas Mačiulis, Linas Kleiza and Mantas Kalnietis dominating with 63 points combined out of the team's 77, guaranteeing Lithuania their fifth European final. The final was a rematch with France. Lithuanians only fought point-to-point in the first quarter. By the third, France finished the quarter with a 14–0 run that kept Lithuania scoreless for four minutes. Eventually the Lithuanians suffered a 66–80 defeat. Despite the deep run, some players said that it was hard to celebrate after losing the final. Still, on 23 September 2013, thousands of Lithuanians came to the Rotušės (Town Hall) square to celebrate the Lithuania national team success, and the following day the squad was greeted at the Presidential Palace.\n2014 FIBA World Cup.\nAfter becoming European vice-champions in 2013, Lithuanians automatically qualified into the 2014 FIBA World Cup in Spain. On 13 May, head coach Jonas Kazlauskas announced both the extended main roster for the national team and the reserve roster. On 1 July, he announced the condensed candidate roster. Captain Robertas Javtokas and team leader Linas Kleiza decided not to participate in the 2014 World Cup due to injuries. On 7 July, first Lithuania national team training camp was organized in Palanga. On 18 August, Lithuania won a preparation game against Slovenia with result 80–76, achieving the national team's 500th victory and the 100th under coach Jonas Kazlauskas. The next nine preparation games were all wins, raising expectations for the Lithuanian performance.\nOn 26 August, just a few hours before the last preparation game against Croatia, a final team roster was announced without Artūras Gudaitis and Adas Juškevičius. However, everything turned upside down rapidly in the game itself, when in only three minutes captain and Mantas Kalnietis dislocated his clavicle, forcing him to miss the World Cup. Juškevičius was chosen as his replacement, and Šarūnas Vasiliauskas also won a roster spot. Paulius Jankūnas became the new team captain.\nThe tournament begun with a tough victory over FIBA Americas champions Mexico, 87–74. While the Mexicans won the first quarter 27–22, the Lithuanians then achieved their domination, marked by scoring 20 points against only 2 in the third quarter. One day later, another difficult match was held against African champions Angola, that the Lithuanians won 75–62, led by the young Donatas Motiejūnas and Jonas Valančiūnas, who scored a combined 23 points and defended the team with 18 rebounds. Tough games continued for Lithuania. The third game against Australia had the Lithuanians 19 points behind at halftime, winning the third quarter 28–15, and leading at some points of the concluding period, but still lost 75–82. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas described the game as having the team's worst first half that season. The team recovered by sweeping South Korea 79–49, guaranteeing a spot at the knockout rounds and managing to become the first team in FIBA World Cup history to not have any free throw attempts. Lithuania took first spot in the group by closing with a tremendous victory against Slovenia, 67–64, with the Slovenians only scoring two points in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the eighth-finals, Jonas Valančiūnas led Lithuania to a difficult victory against New Zealand, 76–71. In the quarter-finals, Renaldas Seibutis helped Lithuania beat Turkey 73–61 and advanced into the semi-finals, once again meeting the United States. Before the game, USA national team head coach Mike Krzyzewski noted that the Lithuanians \"love the game, they play with the passion, they play together, always as a team. They play with the great heart and it will be a tough game for us.\"\nLithuania fought point-for-point through two quarters; however, after half-time Team USA scored 10–0 and after winning the third quarter 33–14, leaving no chances for the Lithuanian team to come back. They ultimately lost the game 68–96. It was one of the worst performances for Lithuania against Team USA, following the 51-point defeat in the 1992 Olympics versus the \"Dream Team\". After the match, coach Jonas Kazlauskas criticized the refereeing: \"It just shows what respect every team has. When I asked the referee about the (technical) foul call, he said that he warned the bench not to jump, when Team USA bench was jumping and discussing with the referees just in the same way. Overall, the judging was hardly understandable until Team USA had 20 points lead. Later there was no point in discussing with the referees anymore\". Longtime Lithuanian national team games broadcast commentator Robertas Petrauskas ironically described the judging live by saying: \"When we discuss the judging against Team USA with the journalists from other countries, we all agree that if the referees would call the turnover every time USA player steps before bumping the ball, Team USA would be the most frequent fallible team in the tournament\". During the bronze medal game Lithuania faced France, just 2 years removed from the EuroBasket defeat. A terrific battle where youngsters Jonas Valančiūnas and Adas Juškevičius tried to give a win with 39 points combined ensued, but the French still beat them 95–93. Despite not winning any medals, the team was received by thousands of Lithuanians at Rotušės square who wanted to thank the national team for their efforts. According to research, over 2,223 million people observed the national team games live in Lithuania, which is over 76% of the country's population.\nEuroBasket 2015.\nFollowing the World Cup's fourth place, Lithuania automatically qualified into the EuroBasket 2015. On 5 May, head coach Jonas Kazlauskas published an extended 25–player main roster, that did not include two long-time players, Simas Jasaitis and Kšyštof Lavrinovič. On 9 July, the shortened roster was announced, with the 12 players enrolled into training camp in Palanga beginning 11 days later. Four mainstays of the team were unable to make the list: power forward Donatas Motiejūnas and centers Darjuš Lavrinovič and Martynas Pocius due to injuries, and Linas Kleiza for exhaustion, expressing a need to rest.\nLithuania began the preparation games phase by defeating Australia twice, as well as Finland and Austria once. Later the team hosted the Huawei Cup at Žalgiris Arena, being champions despite a defeat to Croatia due to wins over Turkey and Macedonia. Lithuanians also appeared again at the Acropolis Tournament, finishing third after crushing the Netherlands, while losing to host Greece and the previously defeated Turkish squad. In total, the national team achieved 7 victories of 10 during the friendly preparation matches. On 1 September, the national team's final EuroBasket 2015 roster was announced.\nLithuania began the European championship in Riga, on 5 September, versus Ukraine. In an Arena Riga almost completely filled with their yellow-green-red decorated fans, the Lithuanians began the match easily and after the first quarter already had a solid lead (19–12), though then began a decay once Jerome Randle and Kyrylo Fesenko led to a Ukrainian resurgence. Ukraine tied the second quarter (14–14) and won the third (19–17), and almost upset the Lithuanians in the final shot if not for a Robertas Javtokas block that ensured a close Lithuanian win, 69–68. Afterwards, the match against the host Latvians had Lithuania losing the first quarter and leading by just one point by halftime. However, then Jonas Mačiulis led a shutdown of the Latvian three-pointers (only 20% during the whole game), and after two solid remaining quarters (11–20, 10–19) the Lithuanians achieved a 68–49 win. The next day, Lithuania surprisingly lost to the Belgium national team 74–76, despite Mantas Kalnietis achieving a EuroBasket record of assists with 13, and Jonas Valančiūnas also delivering a solid performance (25 points, 12 rebounds). The game was closed on a controversial play, as Belgian Matt Lojeski tipped the ball in with just bits of a second remaining and the referees had to analyze if the scoring was still made on time. After the game, many Lithuanian players argued that time was already expired, even if they were unable to make an appeal because, according to the FIBA rules, it should be made 15 minutes after the game. LKF still wrote a letter to FIBA questioning how they should act in such situations. An illness sidelined Valančiūnas from the fourth game versus Estonia, who were returning to EuroBasket for the first time since 2001. Another close match ensued, with the score tied during the final seconds (62–62) before an accurate shot by Jonas Mačiulis saved the Lithuanians (64–62). Tensions reached new heights in the first round closer against the Czech Republic. The game finished tied in 69–69, forcing an overtime which the Lithuanians won (16–12), guaranteeing first place in the group, in spite of all the previous struggles. Kazlauskas wanted to spare the returning Valančiūnas from much playtime given the recent illness, but the player insisted in playing as much as he could, finishing with a double-double.\nAt the eight-final Jonas Mačiulis continued to carry the stagnating Lithuania national team over his shoulders past Georgia, 85–81. The game again was a true thriller, with the Lithuanian squad leading just 80–79 during the final 15 seconds before Mačiulis secured victory by hammering an important three-pointer with just a few seconds remaining on the shot clock. Mačiulis had the greatest number of EFF Points in EuroBasket history with 50 points in that game (34 points with 85% accuracy, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks), being the first player to hit the 50 point mark since Dirk Nowitzki's 52 in the 2001 bronze medal game. At the quarter-final Lithuania, just like two years ago, faced Italy, led by such prominent NBA players like Danilo Gallinari, Marco Belinelli and Andrea Bargnani. The game was so intense that it required an overtime, in which the Lithuania national team turned a higher gear, with three players scoring double-doubles (Jonas Valančiūnas, Jonas Mačiulis and Mantas Kalnietis) en route to a 95–85 that gave Lithuania their third straight semi-final. Following the game, Mačiulis said: \"We won, but there are only three medals sets. We have to win one of these\". The semi-final was a true European basketball classic: Lithuania versus Serbia, coached by Aleksandar Đorđević, who led the then-Yugoslavia to beat Lithuania in the 1995 EuroBasket final. The Lithuanians were considered underdogs of the match due to the Serbians being undefeated that far while the Balts struggled in all games. Still, Lithuania led for most of the time, at times with advantages of 11 points, and while the Serbians scored 21 points in the final quarter, clinched the semifinal with a 67–64 score, advancing into their second straight EuroBasket final. Furthermore, the victory also automatically put the Lithuania men's national team to the 2016 Summer Olympics, their seventh consecutive Olympics, and making Lithuania the only European squad in all Olympics since 1992. Coach Jonas Kazlauskas described the victory as \"unbelievable\", given Lithuania only scored 2 three-pointers while making 20 turnovers. Wild celebrations ensued in the streets of Lithuania after the conclusion of the game.\nWhile none of the Lithuanians playing in the EuroBasket 2015 Final were part of the team who won the 2003 tournament, the adversary was the same, a Spanish team led by Pau Gasol and featuring Felipe Reyes, as well as two of the referees, Luigi Lamonica and Ilija Belošević. And this time, the final went absolutely different, with Spain hitting with stunning accuracy right from the 19–8 first quarter. The Lithuanian squad tried to reduce the deficit multiple times, but the Spanish kept the lead at all times for an 80–63 win. Jonas Valančiūnas and Jonas Mačiulis were selected to the All-Tournament Team, but were visibly unhappy at losing the second straight European championship final. Yet on the next day, the national team members, as in the previous years, were warmly greeted at the Town Hall in Vilnius by a smiling crowd. On 22 September, the team was invited to the Presidential Palace, where they were awarded with more state awards.\n2016 Rio Summer Olympics.\nThe Lithuanian men's national team automatically qualified into the 2016 Summer Olympics without the need to compete in the qualifying tournament after being finalists of EuroBasket 2015. Lithuania, China, Australia and the United States are the only countries to compete in consecutive Olympiad since 1992. On 8 June, the twenty candidates list was published, who were invited to the training camp. On 20 June, first training camp was held. During the first preparation phase in Lithuania, the national team reached 5 of 5 victories, including victory versus the European champions Spain national team in a farewell game 87–83 in Kaunas. Just three days later, Lithuanians reached another victory over Spain 76–78 in Málaga. The preparation stage in South America was less fortunate with the first game being cancelled due to unsuitable conditions, then the first loss occurred to Argentina after controversial refereeing. The only victory there was achieved versus Australia 68–81. The friendly games were finished with another loss, this time to Brazil 64–62.\nOn 7 August, the opening game versus the host team Brazil national team was played. After demonstrating powerful game-play in the beginning, Lithuanians won the first half by 29 points (58–29), though the second half was completely different, which was surprisingly lost by 23 points. Lithuania won the game just 76–82. After the game, one of the team leaders Jonas Mačiulis said that \"this can't happen again\". Following it, Lithuania faced Nigeria national team. After playing two quarters point-to-point, Lithuanians spurt in the third (29–13), led by Mačiulis who scored 14 points during it, and won the match 89–80. Afterwards, Lithuanians overcome Argentina national team, who was yet undefeated in a close game 81–73 and qualified for the quarter-final. The successful start was slowed down by Spain national team, which crushed Lithuania 59–109. It was second highest loss in the history of the Lithuanian national team history. The group phase was ended with another loss to Croatia national team 81–90 and Lithuania finished third in the group.\nThe quarterfinals adversary were Australia, who Lithuania beat to win the last two bronze medals. This time the \"Boomers\" did not give a chance to Lithuania, leading all the way to a 90–64 rout with strong performances by Patty Mills and Matthew Dellavedova. Lithuania finished seventh in the final standings. Following the Olympics, long-time captain Robertas Javtokas retired from the national team. After a successful 4-year lap, head coach Jonas Kazlauskas refused to return to the national team for more summers and left it for a second time. On 25 October 2016, he was replaced by Dainius Adomaitis. On 20 January 2017, EuroLeague legend and former Lithuanian star Ramūnas Šiškauskas was named one of Adomaitis's assistants.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nOn 11 May 2017, Dainius Adomaitis announced the extended candidates list. On 16 June, the shortened candidates list version was published, which most notably excluded Antanas Kavaliauskas, Paulius Jankūnas and Renaldas Seibutis. On 20 June, one of four Lithuanian NBA players Domantas Sabonis, son of all-time great Arvydas Sabonis, announced that he would not represent the national team this year. On 21 June, the national team members gathered for their first training camp in Palanga. On 1 August, Mantas Kalnietis was chosen captain of the team.\nThe preparation games were started by barely defeating the Poland national team 59–58 on 4 August, and with a loss to the Georgia national team 81–70 on 5 August. Following it, the team traveled to Orléans, France, to participate in a not more fortunate international tournament, losing both games to the Croatia national team 80–82 and to the France national team 77–98. On 18 August, Lithuanians reached their second victory by crushing Romania national team 97–64 in Riga, but were convincingly defeated by the Latvia national team 77–87 on the next day, mostly due to the youngsters Dāvis Bertāns and Kristaps Porziņģis. After returning to Lithuania, the team's final roster was announced on 23 August; however, during the team's next-to-last warmup game before EuroBasket, against Iceland national team, Lukas Lekavičius suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the tournament and diminished the 84–62 victory. He was replaced on the roster by Adas Juškevičius. The farewell game was played on 25 August in Vilnius, and was lost during the final seconds 78–79.\nOn 29 August, Lithuania national team traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel for the group-phase games of the EuroBasket 2017. The group-phase was started with a shocking 77–79 loss to the Georgia national team, with Tornike Shengelia scoring 29 points and dominating the game. Although, Lithuanians rehabilitated later by defeating the hosts Israel national team 73–88, Italy national team 78–73 after Juškevičius career-best performance, Ukraine national team 62–94, and Germany national team 72–89 with Valančiūnas powerfully dominating during both games. The successful finish resulted in Lithuania clinching the first place in the group with a 4–1 result. On 7 September, Lithuanians departed to Istanbul for the knockout stage. The intention to win third straight EuroBasket medals was quickly smashed by the Greece national team 64–77 in the first round, with Lithuanians trailing most of the game and failing to defend Kostas Sloukas. Consequently, this time Lithuanians finished ninth. On 10 September, part of the national team returned to Vilnius.\n2019 FIBA World Cup qualification.\nContrary to previous years, no teams were automatically placed into the FIBA World Cup, so all FIBA Europe nations had to participate in qualifications. On 3 November 2017, the national team candidates list was published that did not included any NBA or EuroLeague players. On 20 November 2017, the national team members arrived to Palanga, and on 23 November the team has traveled to Pristina, Kosovo from the Palanga International Airport for their first qualification game versus the Kosovo national team in the Palace of Youth and Sports. Lithuania won the game 61–99 by starting to crush the Kosovans in the third quarter. On 26 November 2017, Lithuanians also crushed their second opponent Poland national team 75–55 in Klaipėda to perfectly finish the first phase of the group stage. On 2 February 2018, list of the roster for the second qualification window was published. On 19 February 2018, the team gathered in Palanga. On 23 February 2018, Lithuanians narrowly defeated Hungary 80–75 in Klaipėda. On 26 February 2018, they crushed Kosovo yet again. On 31 May 2018, list of the roster for the third qualification window was published, which included Lithuanian NBA and EuroLeague players. On 25 June 2018, the strengthened team gathered in Kaunas. It crushed Poland in Gdańsk 79–61 and Hungary in Budapest 73–50. On 3 September 2018, team roster for the fourth qualification window was announced. Prior to the qualification games, Lithuania national team lost a friendly game to the Latvia national team 80–97, but later after defeating the Croatia national team 84–83 in Osijek and Netherlands national team 95–93 in Vilnius it qualified to the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nCoaching staff.\nNotable assistant coaches

Rankings.\nLithuania's consistent status as one of the major powers in international basketball made them rank highly at the FIBA World Rankings.\nAll-time team record.\nThe following table shows Lithuania's all-time official FIBA international record, correct as of 26 February 2023.\nSupporters.\nThe popularity of basketball in Lithuania has caused many international writers to compare the sport to a religion in the country. \"Sports Illustrated\" reporter Luke Winn added that despite the country's small population of 3.2 million, Lithuania ranked fifth at the 2011 FIBA World Rankings (as of 2015, Lithuania is third), behind the much larger United States (313 million), Spain (47 million), Argentina (40 million) and Greece (11 million). The devotion to the team often brings thousands of Lithuanians to travel in their support, no matter what continent. The fans dress and paint themselves in the national colors of yellow, green and red, and spend the games cheering and chanting. Lithuanians frequently display huge flags, usually the national one or the historical Vytis variant. Furthermore, sometimes the modern flag at the center is being embellished with the white color names (often shortened) or the surnames of the most notable national team members, who represents the team at that competition. \nLithuanian basketball fans are famous for energetically and unanimously singing the national anthem before all national team games. Most frequently, they loudly shout the last anthem lines, most notably \"Vardan tos, Lietuvos. Vienybė težydi!\" (English: For the sake of this land. We shall stand together) Other major chants are \"LIE-TU-VA\" (country's name in Lithuanian) and singing of the popular Lithuanian folk daina \"Ant kalno mūrai\" (English: Masonries on the hill). When there is no doubt in victory anymore during the end of the game, the Lithuanian fans begins to chant \"Mes laimėjom!\" (English: We are victorious). One of the most famous fans is Tomas \"Sėkla\" Balaišis, who has followed the team since 2002 and is known for his distinctive long beard.\nEver since its induction during the coverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, \"Trys Milijonai\" became the unofficial Lithuania national basketball team song. The musical theme was used again during Eurobasket 2001, which made the song a runaway hit and a \"de facto\" national basketball anthem. When Lithuania won the European basketball championship in 2003, the song was played right after the final match with Spain. By the 2004 Athens Olympics, the song has become the unofficial Lithuanian Olympic team anthem and by some, is regarded as highly as the unofficial Lithuanian national sports (especially basketball) anthem. Later on, the song was played after almost every match the Lithuania national team played and during its meeting ceremonies after the successful performances.\nUniforms and kit suppliers.\nThe first basketball uniforms worn by Lithuania's national team in the 1930s had two variants: light ones with white T-shirts and dark green shorts, and dark ones with dark green shirts and shorts. Both of these variants had at the front of the shirts \"LIETUVA\" (the country's name written in the native language) and a red circle with the \"Vytis\" coat of arms, in the spot where nowadays such jerseys have sponsor logos.\nAfter the team was restored following Lithuania's return as an independent country in 1991, the jerseys used the same color schemes from the 1930s. Only this time, the neck, shoulders and sides had a three lined piping in the national flag's colors. The light variant had Lietuva in red, while the dark one had the country's name in white. It was manufactured by Reebok. This design remained until 1997.\nIn 1997 Nike replaced Reebok as Lithuania's uniform supplier, a post it retains as of 2015. This led to a new design of the jerseys, with the piping being white in the green jerseys and green in the white ones. The jerseys remained that way until the 2000 Summer Olympics. There another update changed the piping to yellow in the green jerseys, moved the \"Lietuva\" to the stomach, below a circle with the player's number, and added a small Lithuanian flag on the left shoulder.\nAnother change was made in 2003, with a simpler design making the player number loose on the left shoulder, \"Lietuva\" in a smaller font, and no national flag. These probably were the most simplified Lithuanian uniforms ever, but became iconic in the country for being the jerseys of the EuroBasket title.\nIn 2004, major updates were done, enlarging the country name and returning the flag, while changing the piping to yellow-red in the green jerseys and yellow-green in the white ones. On the dark variant \"Lietuva\" was in yellow, while on the light variant it was written in green. This color scheme remained until 2010, once red was dropped from the piping. This made the Lithuanian jersey similar to Brazil's, aside from the different shades of green. Red now only appears on the Nike logo and the Lithuanian flag. In 2014, the side piping had its final change, with the addition of yellow-green squares. Since 2010, the back of the jersey has an imprint. The first one was a basketball net on both jerseys, and since 2012 the white jersey had the Vytis symbol.\nIn 2019, new design of the uniforms was introduced that retained the classical colors, however it reintroduced all three colors of the Lithuania's national flag motifs on the sides. On 10 August 2019, during a game versus Serbia in Žalgiris Arena, Lithuanians wore the interwar design uniforms to pay respect to the EuroBasket 1939 champions.\nGeneral sponsors.\nThe general sponsor of Lithuania men's national basketball team is the biggest team's financial supporter, and is given a prominent spot on the jersey, under the text \"LIETUVA\". The longest-tenured sponsor is the Švyturys brewery, who has designated over 15 million LTL per 15 years for basketball, and was featured in the jersey front from 2005 to 2008. That year, given EuroBasket 2009 was hosted by Poland, Polish Orlen oil refiner and petrol retailer made a deal to become the general sponsor. Following it, Antanas Guoga betting company TonyBet wished to replace it. At first Lithuanian laws only allowed the sponsoring without featuring the logo due to such companies being forbidden to be advertised, but eventually TonyBet's logo was included. Guoga also paid a large share of the required application fee of €500,000 for the 2010 World Championship wild-card. In 2011 TP Engineering company became the Lithuanian team's general sponsor, being replaced again by TonyBet in 2013. In 2014, Vičiūnai Group signed a two-year deal to become the primary sponsor.\nCultural depictions.\nLiterature.\nThere are many books describing the glorious Lithuanian basketball history. Some of them are freely accessible to everyone online at the official publishers websites. The most notable books are such:\nDocumentaries.\nThere are several documentaries about the national team, the most notable one being \"The Other Dream Team\", released in 2013 and focusing on the 1992 Barcelona Olympic team. Another that saw international release was 2012's \"Game of the Nation\" (\"Mes už... Lietuvą\"), about Lithuania's experience hosting EuroBasket 2011. In preparation for the 2004 Olympics, Lithuanian National Radio and Television created \"Lietuvos Krepšinis 1920–2004\", a miniseries about the most important events and players in Lithuanian basketball history.\nVideo games.\nLithuania's national basketball team has been featured thrice in video games depicting international basketball. The first was in 1992, as Sega's \"Team USA Basketball\" for the Mega Drive/Genesis featured all teams from that year's Olympic tournament. Years later, Electronic Arts included Lithuania among various FIBA squads featured in \"NBA Live 09\" (2008) and \"NBA Live 10\" (2009)."

        "title": "Like Swimming",
        "text": "Like Swimming is the fourth studio album by the alternative rock band Morphine, released in March 1997 by DreamWorks/Rykodisc. It was Morphine's first album (out of two) released as part of their multi-album deal with DreamWorks and the last album released within the lifetime of singer and bassist Mark Sandman.\nBackground.\nAfter releasing three albums for indie label Rykodisc between 1992 and 1995, Morphine wanted to leave the label in 1996 and sign with DreamWorks. Since the band still owed Rykodisc two albums, the two labels negotiated a deal where \"Like Swimming\" would carry branding of both labels in North America, and Rykodisc would have the rights for the rest of the world. The deal also included Rykodisc's exclusive rights to two future archival releases: \"B-Sides and Otherwise\" (1997) and \"Bootleg Detroit\" (2000). \nBefore the Morphine contract was sold off to Dreamworks, a finished album had been delivered to Rykodisc for release. However, when DreamWorks got involved, some songs were remixed, two songs were added to the track list (\"Lilah\", \"Hanging on a Curtain\"), and one song was removed (\"In Your Shoes\"). The latter remains officially unreleased. The album's planned October 1996 release date was eventually pushed back to March 1997.\nAlthough \"Like Swimming\" became Morphine's highest-charting album in the US (#67), it failed to produce a commercial breakthrough. As of 1999, the album had sold 141,000 copies in United States, whereas \"Cure for Pain\" (1993) and \"Yes\" (1995) sold a combined 661,000 copies.\nThe album shares its name with a Mark Sandman side project that released the 7\" single \"Swing It Low\" in 1996. \"Swing It Low\" was rerecorded for \"Like Swimming\". \nThe music video for the single \"Early to Bed\" earned a Grammy nomination for Best Short Form Music Video.\nCritical reception.\n\"Pitchfork\"'s Ryan Schreiber, said, \"It's not really that the quality of the songs have deteriorated, it's just that it all sounds the same. They desperately need to alter their sound ... after four identical records.\" Ira Robbins, writing for \"Rolling Stone\", concurred, saying, \"Four albums in, the band is riding the same sound like a slot car; even the welcome flashes of instrumental variety ... don't lead the band far from its usual track.\" Robbins felt that some tracks have \"a hell of a groove\" and show off the band's dynamic control, but ultimately \"too many songs swagger in place, pumping a single line or riff with static electricity.\" AllMusic's Greg Prato felt that although the album has its highlights, it's not as strong as Morphine's previous albums, writing, \"Some of the material doesn't sound fully developed, almost as if the Boston trio was rushed to complete the album.\" \nWriting positively about the album, MTV's Seth Mnookin wrote, \"Sounding as complete and essential as \"Cure for Pain\" and containing some of the kick-ass riffs that were scattered through-out \"Yes\", \"Like Swimming\" is Morphine's best album yet.\" \"Trouser Press\" was also positive, noting the album's many \"adventurous\" and rock-oriented songs, which they felt ended claims \"that the group's setup was intrinsically limited.\"\nTrack listing.\nAll tracks are written by Mark Sandman.\nPersonnel.\nAdapted from the album liner notes."

        "title": "List of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe characters",
        "text": "The \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" franchise debuted in 1982 with the creation of American company Mattel and the toyline of the same name. This is a list of characters that appear in the toyline, television series \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\", \"The New Adventures of He-Man\", \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" (2002), ' and \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" (2021) and the films \"The Secret of the Sword\", ', and \"Masters of the Universe\".\nHeroic Warriors.\nVintage toyline characters (1982–1988).\nAll of these characters were released in the vintage Mattel toyline.\nBattle Cat / Cringer.\nBattle Cat is He-Man's faithful feline companion, an armored tiger who carries him into battle. When He-Man is in the form of Prince Adam, Battle Cat is Cringer, the royal pet. Both Cringer and Battle Cat are green with orange stripes, but Battle Cat is much larger and more muscular. In the original 1980s series, Cringer speaks and is afraid of just about everything, hence the name.\nIn the 2002 series, Cringer occasionally meows like a kitten, but also shows bravery from time to time, including rescuing Prince Adam from falling to his death in Snake Mountain (\"Council of Evil\"). Battle Cat's rescue of Queen Marlena (\"Of Machines and Men\"), based on knowledge only Cringer would have, causes Marlena to wonder about Battle Cat's identity.\nCringer and Battle Cat are voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series, Stephen Root in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and David Kaye in the 2021 series.\nBuzz-Off.\nBuzz-Off is a humanoid bee, established in the Filmation series as the leader of a tribe of Bee People. The 2002 series develops this further, giving Buzz-Off's people a name - the Andreenids - and establishing Buzz-Off as the captain of the defense force of their kingdom of Andreenos, in the Mystic Mountains. He is considered a newcomer to the Masters of the Universe by Ram Man and, while loyal to the defenders of Eternia, is equally loyal to his Queen, at times using his free time to fetch honey berries for her. Buzz-Off has a distrustful nature and tends to hold grudges, but his camaraderie with Stratos paved the way for peace between the peoples of Andreenos and Avion.\nBuzz-Off is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series and Brian Dobson in the 2002 series.\nBuzz off was voted 1st out 7 in the 7 Stupidest He-Man Characters by Total Film.\nClamp Champ.\nClamp Champ is a Heroic Warrior who wields a large handheld grabbing device as his primary weapon. He was the only black character to have an action figure in the vintage toy line. Several black characters (such as Zodak and Dekker) have since been released in the \"200X\" and \"Classics\" toy lines.\nThe character was planned for usage in the 2002 series as a replacement for Man-At-Arms who is turned into a Snake-Man, but the cartoon was cancelled before he could be featured in it.\nClamp-Champ made his TV debut in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Clamp Champ's real name is Raenius. He started out as King Randor's bodyguard before becoming the new Man-At-Arms after Duncan was turned into a Snake Man.\nClamp-Champ is voiced by Method Man in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nExtendar.\nExtendar is a mechanized being and Master of Extension. He did not have an animated form because his figure was made after the end of the Filmation cartoon, but was featured in the Masters of the Universe comics instead. Extendar was an Eternian who was captured and turned into a cyborg against his will by Hordak, only to escape before he could be brainwashed into serving his captor. He vowed to free his friend from Hordak's mind control. The figure came with a red trapezoidal-shaped shield which unfolded, doubling in size.\nThe \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline introduced Extendar as a knight who was captured by Hordak and thrown into the experimental matrix which grafted cybernetic parts to him.\nFisto.\nFisto is an extra-strong warrior with a metal right hand. In the original series, he was the caretaker of a forest and was hesitant to join in the conflict against Skeletor. He was later appraised by both his fellow Eternians and an alien race as second in strength only to He-Man.\nIn the 2002 series, he is the last to join the Masters of the Universe and is revealed to be Man-At-Arms' older brother, to Teela's surprise. The brothers became estranged during the Great Unrest, when Fisto allegedly deserted Randor's forces. Fisto came to the aid of He-Man and the Masters, using his giant fist to free them from the rocks that had entrapped them in a cave-in (\"Web of Evil\"). This act shattered his hand, which Man-At-Arms replaced with a larger, metallic hand. The 2002 figure was packaged as \"Battle Fist\" due to a conflict of copyrighted name with another toy line, but the character was still called Fisto in the animated series. Fisto did not have the classic action figure's purple sword in the cartoon or the new toyline.\nFisto is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Mark Acheson in the 2002 series, and by Ralph Garman in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nStridor.\nStridor is Fisto's heroic armored war horse and faithful companion. He made one appearance in the Filmation cartoon series in the episode \"Origin of the Sorceress\", in which he was a mechanical war horse built by Man-At-Arms who later developed consciousness and an animal nature, leading Man-At-Arms to release him into the wild. Stridor's toy was available packaged with Fisto, as well as separately, and much of Mattel's box art depicted the character of Fisto riding atop Stridor.\nGwildor.\nGwildor is a dwarf-like Thenurian and inventor of the Cosmic Key.\nHe debuted in the \"Masters of the Universe\" movie where Evil-Lyn tricked him into giving her the Cosmic Key so that Skeletor can invade Castle Grayskull.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Gwildor's kind was called the Vejulian Gwitthrol Trolls that come from Tundaria. He attended Grimhammer University in Eternos and studied under many of Eternia's great inventors, archaeologists, and magicians. It was in a small village in Pelleezeea where Gwildor invented the Cosmic Key.\nGwildor is portrayed by Billy Barty in the 1980s live-action movie and voiced by Ted Biaselli in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\".\nHe-Man / Prince Adam.\nHe-Man is \"the most powerful man in the universe\" and in most media he is the alter-ego of Prince Adam. He is armed with a power harness that enhances his strength, the Sword of Power, a battle axe, and a shield. Early media, such as the minicomics packaged with the original run of action figures, also depicts him carrying a knife. He-Man possesses superhuman strength and is capable of performing incredible feats, such as lifting heavy objects such as boulders and buildings, breaking solid rock with his fists, as well as having the advantage over just about any opponent. He is a formidable warrior, although he usually prefers to avoid conflict. He-Man is a strong upholder of moral justice and is regarded by the people of Eternia as their greatest hero. In the original minicomics, He-Man was a wandering barbarian hailing from a jungle tribe. However, both the DC comics and the cartoon series \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" portrayed him as the alter ego of the young Prince Adam, heir-apparent to the throne of Eternia, and most media since have followed suit. Prince Adam is the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena of Eternia, and is viewed by many as fun-loving, lazy, and cowardly. This is merely an act to keep people from suspecting that he is also He-Man. The 2002 cartoon revealed that Adam was carefree and reckless in his younger days, before he accepted his destiny. Prince Adam was given the Sword of Power by The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, and when he lifts the sword and says \"By the Power of Grayskull... I Have the Power!\" he is magically transformed into He-Man, defender of Eternia. Man-At-Arms, Orko, and the Sorceress are the only characters who share in the knowledge of Adam's secret. In the He-Man and She-Ra \"The Secret of the Sword\" movie (which is directly in sequential continuity with the original He-Man and The Masters of The Universe animated series) Prince Adam/He-Man discovers that he has a long lost twin sister, Princess Adora, who was abducted from Eternia as an infant by the evil warlock/warlord Hordak and his then apprentice Skeletor. After He-Man rescues Adora from brainwashed service to the Evil Horde, she receives her own magical sword and becomes She-Ra.\nDepending on his transformation to He-Man, at times he is also armed with plate armor, a battle axe, a shield, or deadly snake pinchers. In the 1980s series, Prince Adam and He-Man are almost identically drawn, the difference being that Adam has lighter blonde hair and paler skin, while He-Man has bronzed skin and more golden hair.\nIn \"Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen\", which features a teenaged Adam, he is much shorter and slender than his alter-ego, with blonde eyebrows and pants (versus 1980s Prince Adam's tights). He speaks with a higher tone of voice and often comes across as a clueless adolescent. He-Man, however, has black eyebrows, is much taller, and is far more muscular, as his transformation to He-Man later in the series (starting with \"Council of Evil\") shows. His voice is deeper, he is wise, and his age in indeterminate (mid 20s to mid 30s in appearance).\nPrince Adam and He-Man are voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series, Cam Clarke in the 2002 series, Chris Wood in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" with Dee Bradley Baker providing the voice of his savage appearance, and Yuri Lowenthal in the 2021 series. In the 1990s series, Prince Adam was voiced by Doug Parker while He-Man is voiced by Garry Chalk. In the 1980s live-action movie, He-Man was portrayed by Dolph Lundgren.\nKing Randor.\nKing Randor is the ruler of Eternia, son of King Miro, husband to Queen Marlena, and father of Prince Adam and Princess Adora.\nIn the original animated series, King Randor is chiefly shown wearing his crown and royal robes, presiding over dinners, and shaking his head over Adam's supposed laziness and Orko's apparent ineptitude. In the episode \"Prince Adam No More\", he demonstrates battle abilities when he helps He-Man fight off Skeletor's flying robots as they escape from Snake Mountain, mentioning his \"strong left hook\" from his warrior years. In the He-Man and She-Ra \"The Secret of the Sword\" movie, he threatens to tear Snake Mountain to the ground in order to rescue Princess Adora after Skeletor and Hordak abduct her a second time.\nIn the 2002 series, the character of King Randor was significantly redesigned in appearance and personality, presented as more of a full-time warrior king. Physically, he is tall, muscular, and compelling, somewhat Viking-like in appearance. He is introduced during the Great Unrest as a captain who, with comrades including Man-At-Arms, is defending Eternia from evil. After battling and mortally wounding the usurper Keldor, Captain Randor is informed by the Council of Elders that he will rule Eternia as king and, that in the times of future trouble, a hero will appear to assist him in defending the land. Throughout the 2002 series, Randor is shown to be a wise, just, and involved ruler of Eternia, presiding over peace talks with other peoples, forming a ruling council, and, at times, battling the forces of evil alongside He-Man and the Masters. As in the original series, he expresses frequent disappointment over Prince Adam's apparent lack of responsibility. Like the Sorceress, he too had his figure released belatedly in the toy line (in its closure rather than its opening).\nKing Randor is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series (including in the He-Man and She-Ra \"The Secret of the Sword\" movie and in their primetime Christmas Special), Michael Donovan in the 2002 series, Diedrich Bader in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Fred Tatasciore in the 2021 series.\nMan-At-Arms.\nMan-At-Arms is He-Man's closest ally, originally packaged in the Mattel toy line as the 'Heroic Master of Weapons'. He is Teela's adoptive father and is the inventor of most of the weaponry and vehicles used by the Heroic Warriors. Since \"Man-At-Arms\" is actually a title, not a name, the character is also known as Duncan. The original minicomics depicted him as the latest in a long family line of great warriors and inventors, who uses the material resources at his disposal to aid He-Man. The cartoon series \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" by Filmation portrayed him as the Man-At-Arms to King Randor and Queen Marlena of Eternia, who holds residency at the Royal Palace, where his workshop is based. This portrayal has been adopted by most subsequent versions of the franchise. The cartoon portrayed Man-At-Arms as a mentor to Prince Adam, and as such he was one of the few people aware that Prince Adam and He-Man were one and the same. In the He-Man and She-Ra \"The Secret of the Sword\" movie, it is revealed that Man-At-Arms' heroic intrusion on Hordak's abduction of an infant Princess Adora prevented the villain from also abducting Prince Adam.\nThe live action movie's portrayal of Man-At-Arms was similar to that of the cartoon, although he seemed to be a seasoned war veteran and possibly the biological father of Teela rather than adopted.\nThe 2002 cartoon series' portrayal of the character was mostly consistent with that of Filmation. The show also reveals that Man-At-Arms served as one of King Randor's chief supporters back during the Great Unrest, before the Council of Elders informed then-Captain Randor that his destiny was to be King of Eternia. Man-At-Arms designs and builds weapons and other technology for the royal family; he also helps train the Royal Guard, Teela, Prince Adam, and the other Masters of the Universe. In the 2002 series, Man-At-Arms sports a short topknot, and the armor on his left arm transforms into a different built-in weapons and tools. This newer Man-At-Arms is also older, more grizzled, and has more of a military bearing than the original 1980s version.\nThe original Man-At-Arms action figure comes with a club, but the character was rarely ever seen with it in the cartoon. The figure did not have the moustache seen on the character in the cartoon.\nIn the 2021 series, Duncan is depicted as a friend of Teela.\nMan-At-Arms was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series, Garry Chalk in the 2002 series, Liam Cunningham in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Antony Del Rio in the 2021 series. In the 1980s live action movie, he is portrayed by Jon Cypher.\nMan-E-Faces.\nMan-E-Faces is a multi-faced Heroic Warrior, with the ability to change his faces from a human face to a monster face to a robot face. His physical abilities mirror the face he wears. Man-E-Faces, at times called \"Manny\" by his fellow Masters, had a prodigious career as an actor prior to his transformation. He is also a master of disguise. His strongest persona, Man-E-Monster, was also his weakest, because as a monster he could initially be controlled by Beast Man. He enjoys playing the Eternian version of chess; Man-At-Arms built Roboto originally to serve as a gaming partner for Man-E-Faces. The figure came with a gun but it was not used in the cartoon.\nMan-E-Faces is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Paul Dobson in the 2002 series, and Stephen Fry in the 2021 series.\nMekaneck.\nMekaneck is the Heroic Warrior with a telescoping mechanical neck that enables him to serve as a spy and do reconnaissance. Man-At-Arms is the one who gave him his extending prosthetic neck, although in the 2002 series this is never discussed; Man-At-Arms is only shown repairing kinks and damage to Mekaneck's neck.\nIn the 2002 series, Mekaneck occasionally feels useless and wishes he had better superpowers than just an extending neck. This leads him to unknowingly retrieve Count Marzo's power amulet, in the vain hope that he'd be granted better abilities. He-Man and the other Masters finally convince Mekaneck of his worth. Only the figure came with the club, he did not have this in the 1980s cartoon. However, he did use it in the 2002 series. Mekaneck also had a son by the name of Philip.\nMekaneck is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series and Gabe Khouth in the 2002 series.\nCBR voted Mekaneck 10th worst He-Man toy.\nMeteorbs.\nThe heroic Meteorbs are members of the Rock People who can transform from meteors into animal forms. They appear among Stonedar and Rokkon in the Star Comics (Comet Cat only appeared in one episode of the Filmation cartoons). They are portrayed as pets rather than equal members of the heroic warriors.\nMoss Man.\nMoss Man (real name Kreann'ot n'Horosh) is a plant-based hero and master of camouflage who can manipulate plant matter, causing flowers to grow but also causing tidal waves of moss and vegetation.\nIn the 2002 series, Moss Man is a quiet pastoral type who resides in the Eternian forests. Although invited to join the Masters of the Universe by He-Man, Moss Man chooses to retain his position as the guardian of Eternia's flora but agrees to help the Masters whenever he can. His assistance proves pivotal in \"Council of Evil\" and in other episodes.\nThe Moss Man figure came with a pine-like scent, textured fur-like moss, and was formed from the same mold as Beast Man. His teeth were painted flat like a plant eater, but you could still see the unpainted Beast Man fangs. In the 1980s cartoon, he only has two appearances because the cartoon was drawing to a close by the time his figure was released. The club (figure's accessory) did not appear in the cartoon, in which he was portrayed as very peaceful.\nMoss Man is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, John Payne in the 2002 series, and Alan Oppenheimer in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nComic Book Resources listed the character as part of He-Man: 15 Most Powerful Masters of the Universe. CBR voted Moss Man 7th worst He-Man toy.\nOrko.\nOrko is a magician from the parallel world of Trolla. Orko's magical abilities vary, depending on his location. On Eternia, Orko's magic doesn't work properly and his spells frequently backfire with humorous results, while in contrast on his homeworld of Trolla he is a master magician. Orko's attempts at helpfulness often end up causing only more trouble for the Masters and the royal family; however, in the 2002 series, his magic is much more controlled and successful, in several instances saving the day. The newer series attributes Orko's occasional ineptitude to the loss of his magic wand while saving 10-year-old Prince Adam upon arriving in Eternia. In the original series, he also saved young Prince Adam's life upon his arrival in Eternia, although he lost his magical amulet in the process. The reason why Trollan magic does not work well on Eternia was explained in \"Dawn of Dragoon,\" in which Trolla is portrayed as a backwards world, where tree roots extend to the sky and leaves are in the ground, and Prince Adam had to recite his magic spell backwards to become He-Man. Orko moves around by levitating. He was depicted as able to walk, but only on a few occasions in which he was rendered unable to float. Orko's face is concealed by a floppy hat and heavy scarf; according to tradition, members of his people only show their visage to their one true love (in Orko's case, Dree-Elle). He-Man describes Trollan face showing as \"like getting engaged.\" Orko is one of the few beings on Eternia who know that Prince Adam is He-Man. In the She-ra series, Orko evinces a crush on She-ra. Orko is also the main catalyst of the central action in the He-Man and She-Ra Christmas special.\nOrko is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Gabe Khouth in the 2002 series, Griffin Newman in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Tom Kenny (as \"Ork-0\") and Wallace Shawn (as \"Orko the Great\") in the 2021 series.\nRam Man.\nRam Man is a stocky warrior with poor verbal skills whose chief method of attack/defense involves using his head as a battering ram. He is unswervingly loyal to the people of Eternia, at times questioning the loyalty of newer Heroic Warriors such as Buzz-Off. However, he is also a bit naive and gullible. His lack of intelligence is often played for humor. The moral in \"House of Shokoti, Part I\" was considered so obvious that Ram Man delivered a lesson about not trying to imitate his human battering ram practices, noting both his heavy armor and his nature as a fictional character.\nIn the original cartoon series, Ram Man is rather short, whereas in the 2002 series he is very large, one of the tallest heroes. He wears an armored helmet in both series, although in the 2002 series he is shown to remove it at times, displaying his short-cropped blonde hair and metal skull cap. He did not use the action figure's axe in the cartoon.\nIn the 2021 series, there is a genderbent version of Ram-Man called Ram-Ma'am who is the identity of Adam's best friend Krass'tine.\nRam Man is voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series, Scott McNeil in the 2002 series, Danny Trejo in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Judy Alice Lee in the 2021 series.\nIn 2011, BBC Online reported that performer Jamie Moakes was trying to create \"a new commodity, one to replace gold, silver and copper\", by buying as many Ram Man figures as possible. Ram Man was voted No.9 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by Io9.\nRam Man was voted No.12 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by Topless Robot. Ram Man was voted by Mania.com as the fourth most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures. CBR voted Ram-Man 14th worst He-Man toy.\nRoboto.\nRoboto is a robot Heroic Warrior.\nIn the 2002 version, he was designed and built by Man-At-Arms as a chess-playing robot, who upgrades his body and his knowledge database into that of a fighter in order to assist in the defense of the Eternian palace. Roboto is seen as an unwanted and unskilled pest by Teela, the Captain of the Guards, until Roboto sacrifices himself to protect the Masters of the Universe. Man-At-Arms rebuilds him, and Roboto is finally accepted by Teela. Roboto's mechanical nature helps He-Man in overcoming the Serpent Ring's evil magic, him being a machine did not get possessed by King Hiss's magic. Roboto is the only character (especially released as his figure at the same time he debuts in the cartoon) to appear only once in the 1980s cartoon because the cartoon was about to end when Mattel released his figure. Similar to Trap Jaw's figure, the right arm of the original action figure had interchangeable attachments, which included an axe, laser gun, and claw. Rotating the figure's waist causes gears in his torso to spin, as well as open and close his mouth, which typically hung open when the figure was packaged, but stayed firmly shut in the show unless he was speaking.\nRoboto is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series, Michael Donovan in the 2002 series, and Justin Long in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nRio Blast.\nRio Blast is an Eternian gunslinger with weapons hidden in his body. He was never seen in the 1980s cartoon because it came to a close before the release of his figure. \"Colonel Blast\", inspired by prototypes of this character, did appear on \"She-Ra: Princess of Power\". In the Marvel comic, he was frequently shown eating cayenne peppers.\nRio Blast was voted No.5 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by Io9. Rio Blast was voted 1st out 7 in the 7 Stupidest He-Man Characters by Total Film.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe\" toyline, Rio Blast was the sole survivor of a group of heroic explorers on a starband near Eternia and became the \"law\" of that last frontier. When a meteorb brought him to Eternia, he sided with He-Man in his battle against Skeletor's forces.\nRock People.\nThe Rock People (also known as the Comet Warriors) are allies of He-Man and She-Ra. Both only appeared in the She-Ra cartoon, since the He-Man cartoon stopped production by the time their figures were released. They came from the planet Geolon which was destroyed by Horde Prime.\nRotar.\nRotar is the Master of Hyper-Spin. He was a guard at the Royal Palace of Eternia until one of the battles against Skeletor's Evil Warriors left him injured. Man-At-Arms saved him with one of his latest inventions called the Gyro Machine. Rotar mostly goes up against Twistoid in battle.\nHis figure was made after the end of the 1980s Filmation cartoon so he did not appear in animation.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" storyline, Rotar's real name is Runar.\nSorceress of Castle Grayskull.\nThe Sorceress (real name Teela Na) is the mystic guardian of Castle Grayskull. She acts as a conduit to the surging energies that dwell within the walls of Castle Grayskull. She can only temporarily access them, as it is shown to overwhelm her when exerting the power for long periods of time. Her powers include; telepathy, telekinesis, clairvoyance, teleportation, large scale energy barriers, mystics bolts, illusion projection and can polymorph. She can also create portals to various worlds, dimensions and even across time. It is she who bestows on Prince Adam the power to become He-Man. With Grayskulls magic focused by the power sword, He-Man has inexhaustible access to Grayskulls power. In the original animated series, the Sorceress cannot leave the castle for long periods of time unless she utilizes the “Crystal of Ala-nah”. It allows her to use the power of Grayskull and remain in her true-form temporarily. Once the crystal is exhausted, her link to Grayskull diminishes and she will revert to her falcon form, Zoar. In \"The Secret of the Sword\" movie, which sequentially follows season two of the original animated series (in a unified continuity), it is the Sorceress who sends He-Man on the quest to find and rescue his long lost twin sister Princess Adora (who later becomes She-Ra ).\nIn the 2002 series, the Sorceress is far from powerless outside Castle Grayskull in her human form, as she demonstrates when she magically defends a village against an evil warlord. The 2002 series also portrays the Sorceress as more capable and more involved with the goings-on of Eternia. Unlike the 1980s Sorceress, who mainly sent psychic calls for help to He-Man, the 2002 Sorceress is more of a defender herself, physically and magically protecting Castle Grayskull and the power of the Elders contained within. The Sorceress is also the mother of Teela, who is destined to inherit her place, although Teela does not know this initially. In the 2002 incarnation, the Sorceress' connection to Teela is alluded to early on in the series. The Sorceress herself is quite different in appearance from her 80s version. The 1980s version features a woman in a white feathered leotard with a falcon-shaped feathered headdress and wings. In the 2002 version, the Sorceress is much more Egyptian in appearance, with a headdress resembling the Egyptian god Horus, an armored bodice, skirt, bare arms, jewelry, and a magical staff. It is disclosed that the Sorceress is just one in a line of Sorceresses whose duty it is to protect the secrets of Castle Grayskull.\nIn the 2013–2014 DC Comics ongoing series, the Sorceress of Grayskull is captured and imprisoned by Skeletor. Loyal to the end, she refuses to talk or eat until an impatient Skeletor kills her before engaging his nephew Adam/He-Man in a battle outside Castle Grayskull where his Havoc staff is broken and his jaw shattered by He-Man, before being knocked into the pit between Grayskull and the Evergreen Forest. Skeletor is presumed dead, but Adam/He-Man knows this might not be true. A memorial service is held in the Sorceress' honor in Eternos City following the battle at Grayskull.\nHer 1987 action figure was released belatedly, as the toyline was about to end. The Sorceress character originated at Mattel, but the action figure is based on her Filmation cartoon design.\nThe Sorceress of Castle Grayskull was voiced by Linda Gary in the 1980s series, Venus Terzo in the 1990s series, Nicole Oliver in the 2002 series, Susan Eisenberg in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Kimberly Brooks in the 2021 series. In the 1980s live-action film, the Sorceress is portrayed by Christina Pickles.\nShe-Ra / Princess Adora.\nShe-Ra is introduced in the animated movie \"The Secret of the Sword\" (a same continuity, direct extension of the original He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Filmation cartoon) as Force Captain Adora, who was an agent of the Evil Horde that rules the planet Etheria. She discovers that she is the long-lost twin sister of Prince Adam (AKA He-Man ) and the princess of Eternia, having been stolen by the Horde's leader, Hordak, as a baby. She is granted the Sword of Protection, which parallels He-Man's Sword of Power, gaining the power to transform into She-Ra, her secret identity.\nFor more details on She-Ra related characters (including the members of the Evil Horde ) who play a role in the larger Masters of The Universe mythos, see * .\nStratos.\nStratos is one of the Heroic Warriors. He has the power of flight and energy projection, and is the leader of a race of birdpeople who inhabit the airborne city of Avion, high in the Mystic Mountains. He appeared regularly in early episodes of the 1980s cartoon series by Filmation, and the season 2 episode \"Betrayal of Stratos\" explained that Stratos and his people gained their power of flight from the Egg of Avion, a sacred relic of his kingdom.\nThe 2002 cartoon series by Mike Young Productions portrayed Stratos as a long-serving member of the Masters and seemingly one of the older members of their ranks. Stratos and his race featured prominently in the episode \"Sky War\" which revealed that Avion has had clashes with the people of Andreenos (the bee people) but, thanks to Stratos and the Andreenid captain Buzz-off working together as Masters of the Universe, there is now peace between the two peoples.\nNo origin was ever given for Stratos in either of the two cartoons, but a comic produced by MV Creations to accompany the 2002 series revealed that his entire race was flightless until a magical staff gave them wings and the power of flight. The people of Avion use rocket packs for increased speed and navigation. During battle, they also carry rocket launchers and bombs. In the 1980s series, Stratos sported just a few feathers on his arms and flew Superman style, with his arms straight ahead. In the 2002 series, Stratos was redrawn to have full wings and a little more heft to his frame.\nStratos is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Scott McNeil (who gave Stratos an accented inflection that seems to blend Sean Connery with Patrick Stewart) in the 2002 series, and Zeno Robinson in the 2021 series.\nStratos will appear in the Live Action He-Man movie. In the film, he will be nicknamed the \"Angel of Death,\" and will rule over the Sky Guards of the Iron Gate Prison.\nSnout Spout.\nSnout Spout is a heroic firefighter with a metal elephant-shaped head, who can squirt water out of his trunk. He appears in the \"She-Ra\" cartoon and in several \"He-Man\" comic books as an Eternian warrior. In several of his \"She-Ra\" appearances, he is called by the figure's prototype name \"Hose Nose\". He only appears in the She-Ra cartoon because the original He-Man cartoon stopped production by the time his figure was released. Of course, one episode mentioned that he was a friend of He-Man. He more closely resembled the action figure in his \"Snout Spout\" appearance than he did in his \"Hose Nose\" appearance. A planned episode of She-Ra was to include Snout Spout's kind called Hosers, but it was scrapped. His figure came with a fireman's axe (he did not have this in the cartoon).\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Jaxton was an Etherian peasant who was one of three gladiators captured by Hordak and thrown into the experimental matrix which grafted cybernetic parts to him. He later escaped to Eternia and sided with He-Man.\nSnout Spout is voiced by George DiCenzo in the 1980s cartoon.\nSy-Klone.\nSy-Klone (real name Dash-Shel) is a Heroic Warrior with the power of hyper-spin. He can generate whirlwinds and fly by spinning his torso and arms. He was only shown twice in the 1980s series because his figure was released before the cartoon's closure. The figure came with a yellow shield (which is absent in the cartoon).\nIn the 2002 continuity, Sy-Klone was recast as a mystic guardian of the Legacy Stones and the last defender of Anwat Gar, the Tibetan-Japanese-style temple that housed these stones. After destroying the stones, He-Man invited Sy-Klone to become a Master of the Universe. Sy-Klone's look resembles that of a stylized samurai. He tends to speak in proverbs, which irritates Teela from time to time. He is very lawful and righteous in nature.\nIn the 2014 DC Comics ongoing series continuity, Sy-Klone was of the Gar race. Other Gar like him were still very much active during the period when King Grayskull lived.\nSy-Klone is voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series and John Payne in the 2002 series.\nTeela.\nTeela is the Captain of the Royal Guard and Man-At-Arms' adopted daughter. The original minicomics depicted Teela as a magical clone of the Sorceress created by Skeletor to do his bidding. However, she was rescued from Skeletor by Man-At-Arms, who raised her as his daughter and trained Teela to serve on the side of good. This portrayal of the character was abandoned for the Filmation cartoon series, which portrayed her as the biological daughter of the Sorceress and an unnamed and apparently deceased father, although she was unaware of her true heritage. The episode \"Teela's Quest\" revealed that Man-At-Arms had raised her from infancy at the Sorceress' behest. Teela is very outspoken and opinionated, at times disregarding direct orders from her father or being left to deal with the consequences for her disobedience. One of her duties is to teach combat skills to Prince Adam. She frequently berates him for his careless and worry-free attitude, but is fond of him nonetheless. She secretly admires He-Man and wishes Prince Adam could be more like him, unaware that the two are one and the same. Episodes such as \"Teela's Quest\" and \"Teela's Triumph\" explained that someday Teela will be made aware of the secrets of Grayskull and succeed her mother as the Castle's guardian, although her destiny must be kept secret from her until the right time comes.\nThe 2002 cartoon series followed much the same portrayal although the character seemed slightly younger, portrayed as an ambitious and headstrong teenager. In several episodes of this series she came much closer to suspecting the dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man than she ever did in the 1980s series.\nThe 2008 toyline \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" has a storyline that combines elements of previous canons with new material, creating a new continuity. This version of Teela is a clone of the Sorceress (as in the early minicomics), is depicted with both red and blonde hair, and would one day take over from her mother as the new Sorceress. Years later, she became the wife of King He-Man and they had a son- the second He-Ro, Dare.\nIn the 2013–2014 ongoing DC Comics series, Teela is betrothed to Adam, unbeknownst to her and Adam. Later, during a battle through Subternia to bring back her mother, the deceased Sorceress of Grayskull, Teela overshoots a jump intended to take out King Hiss and is engulfed in a mystical flame. Dead to her friends for mere seconds, she is reborn as the new Sorceress of Grayskull.\nTeela was voiced in the 1980s series by Linda Gary, Cathy Weseluck in the 1990s series, Lisa Ann Beley in the 2002 series, Sarah Michelle Gellar in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Kimberly Brooks in the 2021 series. In the 1980s live-action film, Teela is portrayed by Chelsea Field.\nTytus.\nTytus was a heroic giant warlord with long blonde hair, who aided He-Ro in Preternia. His weapon of choice is an unusual hollowed-out \"capture hammer\", which he uses to grab his enemies.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\", Tytus came from Perpetua which he had to leave when the dinosaurs there developed strange techno parts. Upon meeting He-Ro, Tytus aided him against the Horde and the Snake Men. During the First Ultimate Battle Ground, Tytus fell in battle when he sacrificed his life to stop Megator.\nZodac.\nZodac is a Cosmic Enforcer. Much confusion has arisen over the character's true allegiance due to conflicting portrayals in different media. The original 1980s toy line packaged Zodac as a 'Cosmic Enforcer' although he was marketed as a villain. However, the DC Comics and the Filmation cartoon series indicated that the character strives to maintain a neutral standpoint, helping both good and evil sides in their times of need while leaning more towards the cause of justice. He appeared in three episodes of the Filmation cartoon series, most prominently in \"The Search\" in which he was seen to put He-Man to the test of retrieving the mystical object known as the Starseed, which could give its holder power over the whole universe. A twist at the end of the episode revealed that Zodac had also informed Skeletor about the Starseed, so that He-Man would be given the chance to retrieve it from him and be tested to find out whether he could overcome the lust for power.\nSeveral other media in the 1980s, such as the UK Ladybird books, pictured Zodac as a thoroughly evil character, a generic member of Skeletor's henchmen.\nIn the cartoon, he did not have the chest hair the figure had, nor did he have the action figure's gun. Also, the figure had clawed hands and feet, while the cartoon version wore gloves.\nThe 2002 cartoon series gave a radically different portrayal of the character. Again he was not officially allied with either the heroic or evil forces, but rather than being a universal mediator between both sides he was portrayed as an ancient and mystical warrior who followed his own sense of right and wrong, without much regard for others. He was introduced in the season 1 episode \"Snake Pit\" as a warrior who had helped defeat the Snake Men in ancient times and held a centuries-long grudge against King Hiss after the latter killed and ate his brother. In season 2, he was called upon to stop the Snake Men after they were unleashed on present-day Eternia, but in a shock twist it was revealed it was Zodac himself who allowed the Snake Men to be freed, purely so he could exact his own revenge on King Hiss. Although the character's sense of morality was highly questionable in this series, he ended up being treated as the ultimate hero of the season, defeating King Hiss all by himself in the series' penultimate episode \"Awaken the Serpent\". Also unlike many throughout the series run, Zodak is amongst the very few who knew of Adam's true identity as He-Man from the beginning. The character was packaged as 'Zodak' in the contemporary toy line and his appearance was significantly altered- for reasons of racial diversity he was black-skinned rather than Caucasian, and had a somewhat tribal appearance, with white tribal markings on his arms. He wielded a staff, unlike the original Zodac who carried a laser gun.\nDue to the radical difference between the 2002 version of Zodac and his 1980s counterpart, the current \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" adult collector's toy line has split him into two separate characters. The first of these is 'Zodac' (real name Zodac Zur) who is the Cosmic Enforcer as in the 1980s media, while the second is 'Zodak' (real name Kar-Tor), a student of the former who took his name and appearance and dedicated himself to fighting the Snake Men.\nIn the 2013 ongoing series from DC Comics, Zodac was given a new and completely different backstory; he is now known as Cosmic Enforcer 097-427-09, Second Platoon out of Overkill Battalion 657, but he's also the half-brother of Hordak and the son of Horde Prime. He is killed and his body absorbed by Hordak one million years before the birth of Adam of the House of Miro.\nZodac made an appearance in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\".\nZodac was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1983 series, Christopher Judge in the 2002 series, and Jeffrey Combs in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\".\nClassics toyline characters (2008–2015).\nKing Grayskull.\nKing D'vann Grayskull is an ancestor of He-Man and She-Ra who ruled Eternia and resided in Castle Grayskull ages before He-Man's time. His wife was the sorceress Veena. During the time of King D'Vann, the Snake People, led by King Hiss, were a threat, as was Hordak. Hordak defeated the forces of King Hiss and was set to challenge Grayskull. A magic Oracle (who, like Orko, hailed from Trolla) revealed to Grayskull that he already had the power within him to defeat Hordak. Mortally wounded in the battle, Grayskull instructed his comrades and advisors to use his power to keep the peace on Eternia and that, one day, a hero would come to help in that endeavor. As he died, Veena promised to protect the power that resided in Grayskull to the best of her abilities and, when she was no longer capable, that she would find one to take her place. Grayskull's immense power rose from his corpse, imbued his sword with power, then surrounded his comrades, who were magically transformed into the beings known as the Council of Elders. King Grayskull was drawn to resemble He-Man, although a more barbaric, Viking-style He-Man (Figure shown at San Diego Comic-Con).\nKing Grayskull was originally designed by the Four Horsemen to be an older He-Man.\nKing Grayskull's action figure was released as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline. In addition, there was an action figure called Spirit of Grayskull where the bio mentions that King Grayskull's ghost still resides in Castle Grayskull and helps the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull protect it.\nKing Grayskull was voiced by Cam Clarke in the 2002 series, Dennis Haysbert in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Alan Oppenheimer in the 2021 series.\nQueen Grayskull.\nQueen Veena Grayskull is married to King Grayskull one of Adam and Adora's ancestors. She is a sorceress with similar powers to the later Sorceress of Castle Grayskull where she wears bird-like attire, leg guards, and is always barefoot.\nWhen King Grayskull died, Queen Veena promised to protect the power that resided in Grayskull to the best of her abilities and, when she was no longer capable, that she would find one to take her place. In addition, she has taken on Sharella as her apprentice where Sharella became the Goddess of Castle Grayskull.\nQueen Veena Grayskull was voiced by Nicole Oliver in the 2002 series.\nBattle Lion.\nBattle Lion is a green lion named Granger who is the pet of King Grayskull and serves a role that would later be served by Cringer. When empowered by King Grayskull's powers, Granger becomes Battle Lion.\nHe-Ro.\nHe-Ro was the most powerful wizard in the universe and a heroic cosmic warrior. He was the protagonist of the \"Powers of Grayskull\" prequel that was never released. He led the forces of Eternia against the forces of King Hiss and the Snake Men.\nHis alter ego in \"The Powers of Grayskull\" line was going to be a young man named Gray, mirroring the Adam/He-Man dual identity. Uttering the magic words \"By the power of good, I strive for peace!\" would transform Gray into He-Ro.\nAccording to his 2009 action figures' packaging biography, his real name is Ro and he was infected with a techno-organic virus by the Horde Supreme during an epic battle and sent through a vortex to the magic planet of Eternia, where he was healed by Eldor. Out of gratitude, he fought with King Grayskull, eventually bequeathing his magic sword to King Grayskull upon his heroic death.\nHe-Ro was voiced by Phil LaMarr in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nIn 1996, a prequel TV series was proposed featuring the character alongside a proposed \"Son of He-Man\" TV series that featured a different He-Ro.\nEldor.\nEldor was a great wizard and sage who was He-Ro's mentor in Preternia and the guardian of The Book of Living Spells. The original action figure was created but not produced. Only prototype pictures exist.\nIn 2014, Mattel finally released a \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Eldor. His bio stated that he found \"Gray\" in a crater affected by a techno virus where Eldor healed him with a mystic pool. To repay Eldor, \"Gray\" became his student and they fought against the Snake Men.\nThe Goddess of Eternia.\nAfter the death of King Grayskull, the Power of the Universe was transferred from the Sword of Power to the Council of Elders, who hid it deep within his castle. Knowing the full sword was the key to channeling the power again, they split it in two to prevent it from falling into the hands of evil. For five thousand years, they waited for a worthy heir to be born. During this time their spirit guide, the creature known as The Goddess of Eternia, trained secret heroic guardians to keep the two halves of the sword separated. Many of these brave warriors took the name \"He-Man\" in honor of the sword they protected giving birth to many different legends of the protector of Eternia.\nThe Goddess is a translucent green repaint of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" Teela action figure. She is based on an early version of the Sorceress, as she appeared in the minicomic \"He-Man and the Power Sword\". This figure is notorious among collectors for its poor quality plastic, which is prone to breakage.\nThe character's \"real name\", Sharella, originates from the short-lived Masters of the Universe spin-off line \"The Powers of Grayskull\", where she was intended to be a tribal chieftess who would have helped Eldor raise Gray (aka He-Ro) and guided him in his battles against the Snake Men. While the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline used the name Sharella for the Goddess of Castle Grayskull, it was also mentioned that she started out as an apprentice to Queen Grayskull.\nWun-Dar.\nOne hundred years before Prince Adam was born, Wun-Dar, a warrior from deep in the savage underground city of Tundaria, rescued a young woman who turned out to be the Goddess of Eternia. Providing him with cosmic battle armor and a sophisticated ray gun that could tap into almost unlimited power, the Goddess tasked Wun-Dar to protect both halves of the sword of He and keep them apart so as not to fall into the hands of evil. Like many warriors before him, Wun-Dar became known as \"The He-Man\", battling in a savage way to keep evil from obtaining the key to the great power hidden inside the long-forgotten Castle Grayskull.\nThe character Wun-Dar was created for the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, with an action figure available exclusively to customers who purchased the monthly (2010) subscription. This figure is based on \"Savage He-Man\", an extremely rare action figure of unknown origins, which is a brown-haired repaint of the original 1982 He-Man. It is commonly believed among the fan community to be a promotional item associated with Wonder Bread, but no documentation has as yet been found to prove the theory. Mattel named the Classics figure \"Wun-Dar\" to pay homage to the myth, as well as including a small plastic loaf of bread accessory with the toy.\nWun-Dar made his TV debut in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nWun-Dar is voiced by Jay Tavare in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nFearless Photog.\nIn 1986, Mattel held a contest for children to send in designs for new characters. 44,000 people submitted their designs. Five finalists were chosen, and more than 150,000 people then voted for their favorite. Then 12-year-old Nathan Bitner entered the contest with Fearless Photog, eventually winning. Nathan was awarded a scholarship for 100,000 dollars, plus a five-day trip to Disneyland. Despite the contest's premise however, Fearless Photog never went into production. \nFearless Photog is a heroic warrior with a robotic camera-shaped head. He has the ability to \"focus in\" on his enemies and drain their strength. His chest plate displays silhouettes of his defeated enemies.\nIn 2011, Mattel revealed that Fearless Photog would finally receive a figure as the first entry in their six-figure \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" 30th Anniversary series. His bio depicts him as an apprentice to Gwildor who invented the Photog Emulator which got him a spot in the Masters of the Universe. During the Second Ultimate Battleground, Fearless Photog defeated Clawful and Whiplash.\nQueen Marlena.\nQueen Marlena is the Queen of Eternia and mother of the twins Prince Adam and Princess Adora. Both the original cartoon series and the 2002 series show her as suspecting her son is He-Man. In the 1980s series, Marlena Glenn is an astronaut from Earth, Boise Idaho. Her ship crash-landed on Eternia. In the 1980s series, Queen Marlena is portrayed wearing a crown and long gown and not doing much other than attending dinners with her husband King Randor. However, in the episode \"The Rainbow Warrior\", her skills as both a pilot and a leader are shown in great detail. Later in that episode it is hinted that Queen Marlena also knows her son is He-Man. This is later confirmed on the Classics toy's biography card.\nQueen Marlena in the 2002 series also wears a gown and crown, but unlike her previous incarnation, offers counsel to her husband and goes on diplomatic missions around Eternia. She is also able to fight with a knife and blaster to defend herself as seen when she is stalked by Kobra Khan and Tung Lashor. Unlike her husband King Randor, she did not have a toy made of her until the Masters of the Universe Classics line in 2011, which packaged her as both the royal queen and the space captain.\nQueen Marlena was voiced by Linda Gary in the 1980s series, Jay Scheimer in a few episodes of the 1980s series, Nicole Oliver in the 2002 series, and Alicia Silverstone in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nEternian Palace Guards.\nThe Eternian Palace Guards are made up of the bravest and noblest warriors in the Light Hemisphere of Eternia. They serve as the soldiers of King Randor and are led by Teela and Man-At-Arms.\nThere was a two pack of the generic Palace Guards in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nSky High.\nFirst appearing in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Sky High is a former Eternian Palace Guard named Darid who is an ace test pilot that assisted in Man-At-Arms' inventions. While defending Eternos from the skies, Darid took up the name Sky High and helped Man-At-Arms to upgrade the Jet Sleds and Wind Raiders for faster acceleration and smoother landings.\nHawke.\nHawke is a female member of the Bird People.\nIn the 80s series, her greed was taken advantage of by Skeletor where she framed Stratos for a sabotage and got him banished from Avion. When she stole the Egg of Avion, Skeletor double-crossed her and had Whiplash imprison her in a cage. After Skeletor was defeated and Stratos was cleared of all charges, Hawke was placed on punishment detail.\nIn the 2002 series, Hawke is a warrior that is loyal to Stratos. She later was present with the Avionian representatives who are members of King Randor's council.\nHawke got an action figure in 2017 \"Masters of the Universe\" classics wave. Her bio states that she was a healer from Calgary until she met Stratos who saved her from the attacking Torgs and they fell in love. When Delora got badly injured after recovering the Egg of Avion and the Emerald Staff of Avion from Skeletor, Stratos and Hawke used its powers which healed her and granted the Avionians the power of flight.\nHawke was voiced by Kathleen Barr in the 2002 TV series.\nKittrina.\nKittrina is a cat-like warrior who appeared in the 1980s series and is a member of the Cat Folk race that lived in the Vine Jungle. As an agent of King Paw, Kittrina was angered that the people of Eternos City was intruding on their Temple of the Cat. She helped He-Man and Teela recover a Cat Folk statue that Webstor stole as part of Skeletor's plot to free the Grimalkin demon from its statue form. Afterwards, Kittrina plans to improve the relationship between the humans and the Cat Folk after being infatuated by Battle Cat.\nKittrina later got an action figure in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nKittrina was voiced by Linda Gary in the 1980s series.\nSlamurai.\nFirst appearing the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Slamurai is a heroic white-clad ninja from the planet Bashido and an enemy of Ninjor.\nThe Mighty Spector.\nJohn Spector is a former palace guard who eventually became known as The Mighty Spector, a time-traveling spy in a purple \"vortex suit\" and member of the Time Agents. Reporting to King He-Man in the not-to-distant future, he travels around in a hovercraft he calls the \"Spectormobile\". Created exclusively for the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nSir Laser-Lot.\nSir Laser-Lot is a knight in an enchanted blue armor wielding a laser sword, shield, and mace. Designed by Geoff Johns and sculpted by the Four Horsemen, Sir Laser-Lot was created exclusively for the Classics toyline. He was the mightiest of King Grayskull's knights on Preternia. He-Man had Sir Laser-Lot brought to the present to serve as the King's new Man-at-Arms so that he can train the King's son Dare and the Royal Guards in ancient battle techniques.\nDekker.\nDekker (voiced by Blu Mankuma) was originally a mercenary from the Dunes of Doom who sided with King Miro during the Great Unrest. When working for King Miro, Dekker trained the palace guards and met Duncan who Dekker took on as an apprentice. Dekker later retired to life as a fisherman on Orkos Island and had passed his Man-At-Arms title to Duncan. He does occasionally help the Masters of the Universe in their fight against the forces of evil.\nDekker was created for the 2002 cartoon series and was eventually made into an action figure in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline which revealed his full history.\nCastle Grayskullman.\nCastle Grayskullman was created for the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" by lifelong MOTU enthusiast Daniel Benedict after winning the 30th Anniversary \"Create-A-Character\" contest. The action figure's swords are based upon the original Castle Grayskull playset's flag symbols and his shield is based upon the emblem on the Castle's Jawbridge.\nDuring the Second Ultimate Battleground, Hordak and King Hiss' grand army pressed in against the allied heroes of Eternia. Reaching out through the Orb of Power that is hidden deep inside Castle Grayskull, He-Man and Teela (who is the new Sorceress of Castle Grayskull) used an unrepeatable spell to call upon the Powers of Grayskull and infuse life into the very walls of the castle itself. Rising from the castle's hidden Chamber of Defense, Castle Grayskullman marched into battle swinging his dual swords of power where he helped to turn the tide.\nLord Dactys.\nLord Dactys (voiced by Richard Newman in the 2002 series) is the leader of the bat-like Speleans and an old friend of King Randor. The Speleans and the Caligars have been in a feud ever since they found their homes destroyed following the Great Unrest where they helped Miro. In \"To Walk with Dragons,\" Lord Dactys becomes a member of King Randor's council. During the threat of King Hiss, Lord Dactys and Ceratus settled their differences.\nHe later gained an action figure in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, with his name incorrectly spelled as Lord Dactus.\nCeratus.\nExclusive to the 2002 series, Ceratus (voiced by Brian Dobson) is the leader of the Caligars. He has issues with his younger brother Whiplash who betrayed their kind to Skeletor. At one point, Prince Adam mistook one of the Caligars as Whiplash which angered him. The Caligars and the Speleans have been in a feud ever since they found their homes destroyed following the Great Unrest where they helped Miro. During the threat of King Hiss, Ceratus and Lord Dactys put aside their differences.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Ceratus is due for release in 2015. His bio also mentioned that he joined King Randor's council and assisted in the Second Ultimate Battle Ground.\nChief Carnivus.\nExclusive to the 2002 series, Chief Carnivus (voiced by Paul Dobson) is the lion-like warrior chief of the Qadians, a tribe of cat-people. While originally neutral, he agrees with Prince Adam and Teela to side with King Randor and He-Man in the fights against Skeletor. In \"To Walk with Dragons,\" Chief Carnivus becomes a member of King Randor's council.\nHe later gained an action figure in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline where his full name is Carnivus Fervelius III.\nKulatak Elder.\nThe Kulatak Elder (voiced by Campbell Lane in the first appearance, Michael Donovan in the second appearance) is the elderly leader of the snow monster-like Kulataks which were at first thought to be mythical and is exclusive to the 2002 series. In \"To Walk with Dragons,\" the Kulatak Elder becomes a member of King Randor's council.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of the character named King Chooblah was released.\nLizard Man.\nCreated for the original He-Man cartoon, Lizard Man (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is a lizard man. He is shorter than most of his battle comrades with speed and agility as his main attributes.\nHe did not have a toy made of him until 2015 when he was included in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline which revealed that his real name is Gayn. Lizard Man's bio states that he has dealt with discrimination due to his genetic connections to the Snake Men.\nOo-Larr.\nExclusive to the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Oo-Larr is a jungle He-Man based on He-Man from early minicomics.\nIn \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", Adam transforms into Savage He-Man (vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker) who is inspired by Oo-Larr when he channeled the transformation without the sword.\nPlasmar.\nFirst appearing in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Plasmar is a warrior who saw his fellow warriors and his family slain by the Horde and the Snake Men during the Battle of Xarkoran. Absorbing the powers of the Gem of Tomadge, he gained the ability to gain plasma-blast energy. He fought the Snake Men Warriors that he hunted down and even wore their hides. Plasmar was later found by his old friend Clamp Champ where he sided with He-Man.\nVikor.\nExclusive to the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Vikor is the \"He-Man of the North.\"\nSometime after King Grayskull's death, a Viking-like warrior from the north named Vikor was chosen by the Goddess of Castle Grayskull to help protect the Sword of He as Eternia awaits a true heir to be born. Some of his known heroics involved fighting the remaining Snake Men and defending the Valley of Gnarl from the Fighting Foe Men. Vikor's legends will never be forgotten in the great archives of Eternia.\nVikor made his TV debut in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nVikor is voiced by Adam Gifford in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nOther heroes associated with MOTU.\nHe-Man has several allies who are independent of the Heroic Warriors. Although they only occasionally assist He-Man (and only when it suits their purposes), they are considered heroic characters nonetheless.\nGranamyr.\nGranamyr (voiced by John Erwin) is the oldest and wisest of the dragons of Darksmoke, an ancient dragon kingdom on Eternia. Granamyr greatly distrusts humans after a great war between the dragons and humans centuries ago, but he strongly respects He-Man, who convinces him there is still some hope for humankind. Granamyr would appear in a few more episodes of the original Filmation era He-Man cartoon, including in one episode of . Granamyr is one of the most powerful magic users on Eternia and apparently possesses such extraordinary power that even Skeletor dares not challenge him.\nHe did not have a toy made of him in the vintage era. As of December 2012, he has now been included in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nGranmyr was voiced by John Erwin in the 1985 series and by John De Lancie in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\".\nFaceless One.\nCreated for the 2002 cartoon series, the Faceless One (voiced by Richard Newman) is an ancient ruler of the former city of Zalesia, which now lies in ruins. In the comic adaption of MoTU, it is revealed that said mystic was once an Elder on the Council of Wisdom. But when his daughter was stolen from his kingdom by the Snake Men, his former compatriots turned their backs on him due to breaking their cardinal law against siring a family. In return for the safety of his progeny, King Hiss would demand a means of awakening and controlling an ancient God Beast cast in the form of Snake Mountain from the timeless wizard. The fallen king would oblige, but felt incredible guilt at the horror that followed after Serpos was unleashed upon Eternia. As punishment for betraying the world to the Snake Men, the other Elders cursed him with immortality and mystically imprisoned him within the boundaries of his devastated fiefdom, which had been annihilated in the snake deity's wake. Thousands of years later, he often offers his help or implores the aid of He-Man to atone for past misdeeds, but can only exist outside Zalesia in an intangible ghost-like state. The mysterious child of the Faceless One is later revealed to be Evil-Lyn herself.\nAn action figure of the Faceless One was released in 2011 as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline where his bio was revealed.\nProcrustus.\nOriginally appearing in a comic book, Procrustus is an immortal giant with four arms who resides at the very centre of Eternia, holding the planet itself together with his mystical strength ever since Hordak tried to use the Spell of Separation to get to the Starseed within.\nA toy of Procrustus was released in 2012 as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nStrobo.\nStrobo is a Cosmic Enforcer who appears in a comic book. He has a mirror built into his chest and possesses light-reflecting powers. His design was based on a mixture of parts from existing characters- Sy-Klone's body, Zodac's head, and King Randor's cape.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" action figure of him was released in 2013.\nCartoon and comic-exclusive heroes.\nLieutenant Andra.\nLieutenant Andra is a prominent female character in the Star Comics. However, she did appear to have aligned with Faker in \"Injustice vs. Masters of the Universe\" comic series.\nShe appears in \"\", voiced by Tiffany Smith.\nKing Miro.\nKing Miro (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is King Randor's father and the grandfather of Prince Adam and Princess Adora. Legend has it in the 1980s series that King Miro disappeared for many years, held captive by the evil Enchantress. Restored to Eternia, he is taken to Etheria by Prince Adam to meet Adam's sister Adora.\nIn the 2002 series, Miro was the Captain of the Guards that served the Elders where he had a part in the apprehension of Count Marzo. King Miro has been married twice; his first wife was a member of the blue-skinned humanoid race known as Gar. She gave Miro his first-born son, a half-Gar named Keldor, Randor's half-brother. Keldor eventually became the evil Skeletor.\nDree Elle.\nDree Elle (voiced by Linda Gary) is a female Trollan and Orko's girlfriend. Unlike Orko himself, she did not have a toy made of her until the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline where she was packaged with Montork.\nYukkers.\nYukkers (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) is the mischievous brother of Dree-Elle. Wears a trucker cap and sports a \"Y\" on the front of his garment.\nMontork.\nMontork (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is Orko's uncle from Trolla, who resembles Orko, but has a beard and glasses, No toy of Uncle Montork was ever made until the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline where he was packaged with Dree Elle. His fellow Trollans, Snoob and Yukkers, did not have toys made of them either.\nKol Darr.\nKol Darr (voiced by John Erwin) is a gladiator-like warrior and ally of He-Man. He flies around on Shadow Master, an armored flying horse with the ability to blend into any shadow.\nStarchild.\nStarchild (voiced by Linda Gary) is a beautiful young girl, apparently between six and seven years old. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, and she wears an outfit which resembles a red one-piece bathing suit with a yellow star and white boots. She has incredible magical powers, which she describes as feelings. Said powers cause a glow to appear around those she loves; the Starchild can use this \"glow\" to defend herself from those who would exploit her abilities for selfish ends, as in the Filmation episode \"The Starchild\" when the Tree People and the Cave Dwellers wanted custody of her. She also appears in the Larry DiTillio episode \"Bargain with Evil\", in which she combines her energy with that of another sorceress to open an inter-dimensional gateway.\nMelaktha.\nMelaktha (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) is the royal archaeologist, a muscular, bearded, dark-skinned intellectual who was created by writer Larry DiTillio to add more racial diversity to the original cartoon. He first appears in \"House of Shokoti\" parts 1 and 2. Melaktha has not been released as a toy.\nScrollos.\nScrollos is a mysterious character who served as the narrator of the UK comics, Scrollos also helped observe and protect Eternia from extraterrestrial threats (much like the Marvel Comics character Uatu the Watcher). He resides in a spaceship with a large crew of robots.\nMovie characters.\nNone of these characters had toys made of them.\nEvil Warriors.\nVintage toyline characters (1982–1988).\nBeast Man.\nBeast Man makes his debut in Mattel's illustrated books as a follower of Skeletor. As the toyline expanded, he stayed at Skeletor's side. Beast Man is a mandrill-faced humanoid with orange and red fur, who can telepathically summon wild creatures of Eternia to aid Skeletor's schemes. He was frequently portrayed as a buffoon who could not do much correctly. The whip that accompanied the action figure rarely appeared in the 1980s cartoon but was frequently used in the 2002 incarnation as Beast Man's way of controlling the animals he summoned to do his bidding.\nIn the 1987 film, Beast Man is featured as one of Skeletor's minions where Evil-Lyn listed him as \"The Beast Man.\" He does not speak, but his sounds are translated by Karg.\nIn the 2002 series, Beast Man is far more ferocious and more of a threat to the heroes. He is a skilled fighter and often comes to the rescue of Skeletor and his fellow Evil Warriors, using his griffins as their most frequent means of transportation.\nThe \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" revealed that his real name was Raqquill Rqazz who came from the race of Beast Men who was banished from his home in the Vine Jungle for his evil deeds and allied with Keldor.\nBeast Man was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series, Scott McNeil in the 2002 series, Kevin Michael Richardson in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Trevor Devall in the 2021 series. In the 1987 live action movie, Beast Man was performed by Tony Carroll.\nBlade.\nBlade is a master swordsman and bounty hunter with an eyepatch and has a shenandoah but no hair. His swordsmanship can rival He-Man's. He appears in the 1987 movie, the mini-comics and the Marvel comics. Originally Tri-Klops was going to appear in the movie instead. Like Tri-Klops, his toy is sometimes mistaken for a Heroic Warrior due to his human appearance.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Blade started out as a pirate from the Kylax System who was transported to Eternia by Skeletor. He agreed to help Skeletor at the right price.\nHe was portrayed by Anthony De Longis in the 1987 live-action film.\nBlast-Attak.\nBlast-Attak is a robotic warrior built as a walking time bomb. After a set period of time, he will explode and cause immense damage before reforming, unharmed. He did not appear in the cartoon because it ended before his figure was released. There is some debate over which faction he belongs to, as the Mattel style guide and the original toy packaging state that he is an Evil Warrior of Skeletor, whilst some comics depict him as a member of the Snake Men serving King Hiss.\nThe \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline designates him as a Snake Man when he was summoned to Eternia by Skeletor's light spell and stolen from him by the Snake Men.\nClawful.\nClawful is a giant anthropomorphic crab with claws similar to a fiddler crab. Whereas the figure has swarthy skin and its boots are dark blue, he has all red skin and yellow boots in the cartoon.\nIn the 2002 series, Clawful is strong but has a childlike mentality and isn't very clever. Despite his constant blunders, it seems he is the only Master of Evil whom Evil-Lyn is fond of. In one episode, we encounter more members of his race who are more intelligent than Clawful. They can communicate with each other via long distances using the clicking of their pincers as if it was morse code.\nClawful was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s cartoon and Scott McNeil in the 2002 series.\nEvil-Lyn.\nEvil-Lyn is a malevolent sorceress, whose powers seem to be second only to Skeletor's. Exceptionally cunning, she's merely in Skeletor's ranks to suit her own ends. In the original series, she was not reliant on wands and other objects to generate her magic, although she has used such artifacts as the Shaping Staff to supplement her spectacular innate powers on a few occasions. She evinced shades of goodness in one or two episodes, such as 'The Witch and the Warrior', but her nature is essentially fiendish. There was nothing romantic in her relationship with Skeletor in the original Filmation series, unlike subsequent versions. Although her primary affiliation was with Skeletor, she would also venture out on her own and assist other dark lords such as Dark-Dream and Gorgon on occasion. She seemed to be the only one of Skeletor's evil warriors with the courage to raise her voice at him and chastise him.\nThe original figure has yellow skin, although she is depicted in both animated series as having a Caucasian flesh tone (though the 2002 incarnation has a greenish tint to it). In \"The Witch and the Warrior,\" she removes her helmet for the only time in the series because of extreme heat, and has closely cut white hair. In an earlier episode she appeared to the Widgets as a blonde, but she was specifically using a magic spell to alter her appearance, even though she wore her usual clothing.\nIn the 2002 series, much more of Evil-Lyn's background is revealed, including the fact that her father, known as The Faceless One, is a powerful sorcerer who despairs of his daughter's choice to follow Skeletor. Although Evil-Lyn is shown to have her own agenda, she still maintains some loyalty to her bloodline (\"The things I do for family\", she mutters as she rescues the Ram's Stone from the abyss). Her first meeting with Keldor shows her as a young woman with collar-length white hair who is physically attracted to the man who would become Skeletor (\"I like what I see,\" she purrs at Keldor). Later in the series, her hair is shown to be close cropped. This version of Evil-Lyn relied heavily on her magical staff to cast her spells. Without it, her powers were significantly diminished.\nEvil-Lyn was voiced by Linda Gary in the 1980s series, Kathleen Barr in the 2002 series, Lena Headey in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Grey DeLisle in the 2021 series. In the live action movie, she is portrayed by Meg Foster.\nEvil Meteorbs.\nThese Meteorbs are renegade members of the Rock People who can transform from meteors to animal forms. They are portrayed as pets rather than equal members of the Evil Warriors.\nFaker.\nFaker is an evil robot duplicate of He-Man, created by Skeletor. The toy version is done in blue with red hair and orange torso armor with the backstory that he is a robot duplicate that did not work out. In one annual, he is a deformed clone.\nHowever, in his sole appearance in the cartoon, Faker is a magical creation, identical to He-Man apart from glowing eyes and odd intonation.\nIn \"Masters of the Universe: Revelations\", Faker partakes in the attack on Castle Grayskull and is sliced in half by Man-At-Arms' laser.\nFaker was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series.\nJitsu.\nJitsu appeared only once as a supporting character in \"The Dragon Invasion\" episode in 1983. The character's name in the script is Chopper, although he is not named on-screen. His role in this episode is to accompany Skeletor in an invasion of Castle Grayskull. He has only one line and aside from a brief display of his karate-chopping abilities, has no character development.\nThe character appeared in the minicomic stories \"Hordak: The Ruthless Leader's Revenge!\" and \"Mantenna and the Menace of the Evil Horde!\" The character was not used in the 2002 franchise relaunch, though was included in Series 6 of NECA's \"Masters of the Universe\" mini-statue line, and came with a pack-in figurine of Odiphus, which had originally been planned for release in 2005. Other variations with Jitsu from his animated and figure counterparts – the figure has a full goatee beard but, in the cartoon, he only has a Fu Manchu moustache and, whereas the figure has very brown skin, he is a bit whiter in the cartoon (his boots are even not black in the cartoon unlike those of the figure). Also, the Samurai sword that came with the figure was not included with the character in the cartoon.\nJitsu was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s cartoon.\nNight Stalker.\nNight Stalker appears only in original mini-books. Some versions depict it as Jitsu's evil robotic steed while other versions describe it as the \"reincarnation\" of the heroic Stridor. The original toyline paired the robot horse with Jitsu, making the duo the evil counterparts of Stridor and Fisto.\nMer-Man.\nMer-Man is a fish-man who controls sea life, often depicted as the ruler of Eternia's undersea kingdom. The original action figure had unpainted gloves and boots, unlike the cartoon. The sword he used in the cartoon is different to the \"fishbone\" sword that the figure came with.\nOriginally, Mer-Man was slated to appear the live-action movie, but Mattel would not allow the filmmakers to kill off a character they had created. So, the filmmakers had to create Saurod.\nIn the 2002 action figure and Matty Collector action figure Mer-Man comes with a sword and a trident. In \"Search for the VHO,\" he uses the trident on He-Man.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" storyline, Mer-Man ruled the undersea realms of Eternia until his kingdom was destroyed by rival ocean clans causing him to side with Skeletor.\nIn \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", Mer-Man and his fellow Aquatican warriors attacked Teela's group during their quest to restore Eternia's magic. He was shown to have a closed right eye with a scar over it. Mer-Man voiced his disdain that Evil-Lyn did not bother to conquer Eternia while leaving the oceans to him. With help from Man-At-Arms, Teela's group defeated Mer-Man and his warriors where he was intimidated to let them pass.\nMer-Man is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series, Scott McNeil in the 2002 series, Kevin Conroy in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and George Takei in the 2021 series.\nComic Book Resources listed the character as part of He-Man: 15 Most Powerful Masters of the Universe.\nNinjor.\nNinjor is a ninja warrior who works for Skeletor. He was never featured in the cartoon because his figure was released after it ended.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline where he was also called \"Ninja Warrior,\" Ninjor came from another world when he was summoned by Skeletor to help defeat the Heroic Warriors until there was nobody else to help He-Man. What Skeletor doesn't know is that Ninjor secretly works for Horde Prime in order to find Skeletor's weak points and how to exploit them. Ninjor was mentioned in Slamurai's bio where he is an enemy of Slamurai.\nSaurod.\nSaurod is a reptilian who can emit sparks out of his mouth.\nHe is featured in the 1987 movie assisting Blade, Beast Man, and Karg into retrieving the Cosmic Key. Saurod is vaporized by Skeletor as penalty for the group's failure. He does not speak in the movie and his name is pronounced by Evil-Lyn as \"Saraad\" rather than 'Saw-rod\".\nHis action figure has been the source of controversy with claims that it should not be given to a very young child because the sparks that come out of his mouth are a potential fire hazard.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Saurod's bio identifies him as C'Ngrel Chouluth, a Klybian Lizard Man from the planet Draphnos who rode a meteor shower to Eternia after escaping from Prison Starr. As one of the three reptilian species that were spliced with Snake Man DNA, Saurod became an enemy of King Hiss and sided with Skeletor. It was stated that during the Second Ultimate Battleground, Saurod slew Sssqueeze and Snake Face. Saurod also tried to steal the Cosmic Key from Gwildor to go back in time to prevent the dilution of his species.\nSaurod was performed by Pons Maar in the 1987 live-action film.\nScare Glow.\nScare Glow is a skeleton ghost warrior, who seems to have a solid but translucent body, and whose bones emit a strong glow which can intimidate even the bravest opponents. He wears a long purple cape, and there is a small crack on the forehead of his cranium. He carries a scythe, which is often called the 'Scythe of Doom'.\nScare Glow was introduced into the toy line in 1987. His action figure is notable for its 'glow-in-the-dark' special feature, the 'bones' glowing when positioned in a dark space.\nLabeled as the \"Evil Ghost of Skeletor,\" he refers to himself as the Ghost of Skeletor in the mini comic, Scare Glow was packaged with the mini-comic \"The Search for Keldor\". In this comic he is summoned to Eternia by Skeletor using a magic spell to call forth the most evil beings of space and time, although it is never stated which time period or dimension Scare Glow originates from. He is sent out with Ninjor on a mission to attack the Heroic Warriors with the power of his glow. He uses the glow to overpower Prince Adam, evoking in him so much fear that he is even too scared to change into He-Man. However, he is ousted from Adam's path by Clamp Champ, giving Adam the time to change into He-Man and subsequently defeat him.\nDue to the fact that Scare Glow was never featured in the original Filmation cartoon, the action figure was released in the last series of the original toy line in 1987. As a result, due in part to the figures mysterious origin, it has become one of the most sought after and hardest to find figures by fans. Scare Glow was one of the last figures released. As fewer figures were selling by this late stage, less were produced, making it rarer as a result. On auction sites such as eBay, loose figures have been sold for as much as $100 and the mint condition never opened package (also known as Mint On Card or MOC) Scare Glow has been sold as high as $1,200 USD. The last version issued with the glow in the dark Halberd accessory (versus the more common Halberd made of non-glowing green plastic) is the rarest and hardest-to-find version of this figure.\nBecause he is one of the last figures to be released in Mattel's toy line, Scare Glow never appeared in the accompanying cartoon series, which had been discontinued by this time, and his appearances throughout all media are minimal. Another story that majorly features him is \"Enter the Ninjor\" in issue #11 of the UK Adventure Magazine, which gives him an origin as a being of pure light energy, created by Skeletor in his own image. Invisible in the light, but not in the dark, he is sent out with Ninjor to mount a series of silent, unseen attacks on He-Man and Fisto as they explore Viper Tower. His origin as a magical creation of Skeletor is taken from a promotional card provided by Mattel to the publishers of various story media. A similar story of Scare Glow coming from another dimension summoned by Skeletor is told in an issue of Marvel's Star Comics, Masters of the Universe series.\nAlthough he is not featured in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe franchise, Scare Glow is used in the comic series from MV Creations. He is featured in a special Halloween comic \"The Power of Fear\" that was given away free at the 2003 Children Affected by AIDS Foundation (CAAF) fundraiser, and sold in comic shops to raise additional donations to the CAAF. The story features Scare Glow as a character from another dimension who is summoned by Skeletor to use his powers against the Masters.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Scare Glow is a shifty bounty hunter named Nul who tried to obtain the secrets of Castle Grayskull. In death, his spirit was cursed and banished to the dimension of Infinita until a magical spell of light cast by Skeletor freed him. While being provided with a scythe, Nul became Scare Glow and allied with Skeletor.\nIn \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", Scare Glow ruled a part of Eternia's underworld.\nScare Glow was voiced by Tony Todd in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" and \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\".\nScreeech.\nScreeech is a barbaric bird that spies for Skeletor.\nIn the 1983 cartoon, Screeech is robotic. It is replaced by a bird-like levitating device called a Doomseeker in the 2002 series which is used by Tri-Klops to increase the range of his vision-powers and spy on the Heroic Warriors.\nSkeletor.\nSkeletor is the main antagonist of He-Man. In the original illustrated books and in the Filmation series, Skeletor is an evil demon from another dimension. A later Mattel minicomic implies that he was once Keldor, brother of King Randor, which was in fact intended. The 2002 series and related materials confirm that Skeletor was once a blue-skinned man named Keldor, though the series itself established no familial connection prior to its cancellation, his connection to Randor was heavily implied. The later DVD releases of the series featured bios, confirming ultimately that the shows' creators conceived of Keldor as Randor's half-brother.\nThe only main difference between Skeletor in the cartoon and on the figure is there is no green on his face in the cartoon, nor red glow in his eyes, unlike that of the figure. The original Skeletor figures wore boots designed for clawed feet. This feature was omitted in Skeletor and a number of other evil warriors in the Filmation series. Later, he was depicted with ordinary human feet with long, pointed claws on them.\nSkeletor was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the 1980s series (recycling the voice he used for Ming the Merciless in Filmation's previous series \"Flash Gordon\"), Campbell Lane in the 1990s series, Brian Dobson voice-matching Tim Curry in the 2002 series, Mark Hamill in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" and \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\", and Benjamin Diskin in the 2021 series. In the 1987 live-action movie, Skeletor is portrayed by Frank Langella.\nPanthor.\nPanthor is Skeletor's evil feline companion, a giant purple panther creature called a Dilynx who serves as an evil counterpart to Battle Cat. He would usually be seen by his master's side in his lair or carrying Skeletor into battle against He-Man and Battle Cat.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Panthor was a cub by the time an exiled Keldor found him and Panthor had remained loyal to Keldor ever since.\nSpikor.\nSpikor is a humanoid covered in spikes, and he has a trident for a left arm. He serves as Skeletor's blacksmith. Spikor was not featured prominently in the cartoon because his figure was released when the cartoon was drawing to a close and in the cartoon, did not use the club that came with the figure. In the cartoon, Spikor had normal arms in some episodes and the trident for his left arm in other episodes.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Spikor was originally a blacksmith from Nordling named Kleffton who was fused with an enchanted suit of armor and a mystical trident when he tried to steal a sacred scroll from Nordling's high priests. After being banished, Kleffton was found by Skeletor who used his blacksmith skills to forge weapons.\nSpikor was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series and by Phil LaMarr in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelations\".\nNOTE: Spikor was voted No.10 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by Io9.\nStinkor.\nStinkor is an anthropomorphic skunk with magical control over his own stench. His action figure used the same mold as Mer-Man, wore the same mold of armor as Mekaneck, and actually smelled of patchouli oil, one of only three scented toys Mattel produced (the others being Moss Man and also Perfuma from the \"She-Ra\" line).\nIn the 2002 version, Stinkor was once a Pelezean named Odiphus who romanticized the lives of outlaws. The Sorceress tells that, in the time of the Great Unrest, Odiphus betrayed his people to Prahvus in the hopes of being accepted into the evil warlord's gang. Upon the warlord's defeat by the Sorceress, Odiphus was captured and about to be executed. The Sorceress intervened and Odiphus' life was spared, although he was exiled and retains a grudge against his people. His first appearance is in the Eternian prison, gleeful over Kobra Khan's escape, although he is not named at that time. Through serendipity, an explosion he caused while meddling in Tri-Klops' lab fulfilled his dream of joining Skeletor's organization. The resulting mutations caused the furry creature to gain height, muscle, and the ability to speak in a humanoid manner. His stench is so awful (even to himself, but especially to Eternia's dragons) that a special armored suit was created for him to keep the smell as under control as possible. Some stink still escapes the suit, causing Skeletor and the other evil warriors to cover their noses and to treat Stinkor politely in order to get him out of the room as efficiently as possible.\nStinkor was voiced by Brian Drummond in the 2002 series and Jason Mewes in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nStinkor was voted No. 30 in The 36 Worst Action Figures From Iconic Toy Lines by Cracked. Stinkor was voted No.7 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by Topless Robot. CBR voted Stinkor 6th worst He-Man toy.\nTrap Jaw.\nTrap Jaw is a weapons expert and cyborg with a metal jaw, which can bite through anything. In the mini-comic originally packaged with Trap Jaw, \"The Menace of Trap Jaw,\" he is a villain from another dimension that Skeletor invades in an attempt to enter Castle Grayskull. While Skeletor attempts to weaken the Castle's defenses, Trap Jaw, who is being pursued by authorities, slams into Skeletor and knocks him back through the dimensional portal to Eternia. Back on Eternia, Trap Jaw emerges from the Castle connected to its power by a magical cord. Both He-Man and Skeletor attempt to defeat Trap Jaw, but eventually realize that they must join their halves of the power sword to be strong enough to sever the magical cord connecting Trap Jaw to the Castle. The comic ends with Skeletor carrying the unconscious Trap Jaw back to Snake Mountain where he will become one of his minions.\nTrap Jaw's origin is very different in the 2002 franchise. Originally a minion of Keldor's named Kronis, he became dissatisfied with his lords new regime when Keldor had been disfigured then remade after they're failed usurpation of the Council of Elders by his Evil Horde. Falling out of favor because of this the warmonger was then cast out into the wastes of their domain but would vow revenge on his ex-liege. Doing so by gathering all the brigand factions situated within the Dark Hemisphere to lead a raid upon Snake Mountain. An assault which ended in disaster as Keldor; now going by the moniker of Skeletor had become more powerful than ever, easily decimating Kronis' army. The fatal bout with his former lord left Kronis hideously disfigured; nevertheless, Skeletor pressed him into his service as a subject of ridicule. Skeletor had Kronis' body rebuilt into a cybernetic augment by replacing his damaged humanoid right arm and lower jaw with mechanical parts (off screen). Now going by the name Trap Jaw, the evil warrior would patiently serve for another chance at taking out his hated master. Later, the cartoon demonstrates that the more metal he eats the stronger he becomes, and one episode focuses on a quest to eat the strongest chemical element in Eternia called Eternium (which was forged and guarded by a group of subterranean dwellers called the Kulatuks). He is defeated by getting tricked into eating a special alloy named Deterninum that weakens him. Both cartoon series depict Trap Jaw as bold but coarse.\nIn the 1980s cartoon, his helmet, mantrap mouth, robotic arm and legs are cerise but his robotic arm and legs were black on the original figure; the figure's helmet and mantrap mouth are recolored purplish red. Whereas he had loads of arm attachments in the cartoon (again, most were colored cerise in the cartoon), the figure only came with three (claw, gun and hook) [these were also black]. His belt did not have the skull and crossbones (Jolly Roger) in the cartoon; this was only on the figure's belt. The figure had yellow eyes whereas he had normal eyes in the cartoon.\nTrap Jaw was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Paul Dobson in the 2002 series, Diedrich Bader in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Roger Craig Smith in the 2021 series.\nTrap Jaw will appear in the upcoming live-action He-Man movie.\nNOTE: Trap Jaw was voted No. 8 in The 14 Least Masterful Masters of the Universe by Io9.\nTri-Klops.\nTri-Klops is an interdimensional bounty hunter and swordsman who can see in any direction. His eyes, which are on a rotating visor around his head, have different abilities in different versions; one common ability is the power to see through solid objects. He is also able to see in the dark and over long distances with his Night-vision and Dista-vision eyes. Tri-Klops wears the \"Gammavision\" ever since he was blinded in an accident. In both the 1983 and 2002 cartoons, his eyes can also shoot energy bolts, although this is not commonly used in other material. A well-known classic villain of the MOTU line, Tri-Klops was one of Skeletor's chief henchmen, stoic and obedient, and was frequently featured in the Filmation cartoon.\nThe 2002 version depicts him as Skeletor's irritable inventor, with some cybernetic features to his appearance. According to the book Mastering the Universe \"Tri-Klops was a good guy\" (p. 120) [Roger Sweet may have meant he was originally supposed to be good; ultimately the toyline and all media depicted him as an Evil Warrior]. The original toy's product subtitle carried on all packaging and advertisements was \"Evil &amp; sees everything\". Tri-Klops has brown hair in the cartoon (the figure has black hair), the visor helmet has different shapes of eyes (square, circle and triangle) [all white and red] in the cartoon but, on the figure, one eye is light blue, one eye is white &amp; red (green on the 200X and Classics figures), and one is a dark red; the edges of his armor aren't as jagged in the cartoon unlike that of the figure, his boots are reddish-brown instead of black in the cartoon (only the figure's boots are black) and he did not wield the long sword in the cartoon (the sword only came with the figure).\nIn \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", Tri-Klops took part in Skeletor's large scale attack on Castle Grayskull, leading a group of Skelcons while flying one-man War-Sleds. Tri-Klops appeared to be enjoying himself, until his vehicle was shot down by Man-At-Arms and the Royal Guard who arrived to join the battle flying on their Sky-Sleds. Some time later after magic had all but left Eternia and Skeletor and He-Man were thought to be dead, Tri-Klops took advantage of the situation by condemning magic altogether and became a leader in the cult of Motherboard. Ironically, Tri-Klops used one of the few remaining magic items left on the planet to perform the ritual miracles of Motherboard. During this ceremony, Tri-Klops would catch electronic looking water that sprang from a large altar inside Snake Mountain in a magic goblet and force his followers to drink it. By doing so, they would instantly transform into cyborgs, with various limbs being replaced by mechanical weapons.\nIn the 2021 series, Tri-Klops is a surveillance and retrieval drone built by Kronis.\nTri-Klops was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Paul Dobson in the 2002 series, Henry Rollins in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", and Kevin Smith in the 2021 series.\nTwistoid.\nTwistoid is a robotic minion of Skeletor. Skeletor stole the blueprints for the machine Man-At-Arms used to create Rotar and used the machine to create Twistoid. He and Rotar are rivals.\nTwistoid did not appear in the cartoon because it ceased production before his figure's debut. Twistoid was voted by Mania.com as the seventh most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" storyline, Twistoid was depicted as a purely robotic energy robot\nTwo Bad.\nTwo Bad is an Evil Warrior strategist with two heads that constantly argue among themselves. The UK comics name the two heads \"Blue Face\" and \"Yellow Band\".\nThe early figures had a more fully rounded back on the torso, but then the figures were released with more of a flattened back. He was never featured prominently in the 1980s cartoon because it was drawing to a close by the time his figure was released. However, his only prominent appearance in the 1980s cartoon was \"Capture the Comet Keeper\". This is because he was the replacement character in the episode working for Skeletor at Snake Mountain for Beast Man and Trap Jaw, who were going to feature in the episode, but Robert Lamb asked Arthur Nadel to replace them with Two Bad to make Mattel's newest figure releases more prominent in the cartoon. The shield included with the figure did not appear in the cartoon.\nIn the 2002 version, they were originally two rival bounty hunters named Tuvar and Baddhra who bickered constantly. They were both highly recommended to Skeletor by Whiplash. Tuvar and Baddhra were magically fused into one being by Skeletor after they failed to work together in destroying He-Man. Both sides blamed each other for their predicament. Two Bad becomes one (or two) of Skeletor's Evil Warriors and appears throughout the remainder of the series among Skeletor's henchmen. At one point, they tried to find a spell of separation from a man that Stinkor knew which was not the type of separation that they were hoping for as that spell nearly separated Eternia.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, the spell that was used on them by Skeletor was an unrepeatable spell.\nIn the 2021 series, Tuvar and Baddhra were first seen as members of King Randor's palace guards.\nTwo Bad was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series, Brian Drummond and Mark Gibbon in the 2002 series, and Yuri Lowenthal and Fred Tatasciore in the 2021 series.\nCBR voted Two bad 12th worst He-Man toy.\nWhiplash.\nWhiplash is an alligator-like creature whose tail is a formidable weapon. He is one of Skeletors' Evil Warriors. He did not have the toy's spear in the cartoon (this only came with the figure) and, like Mer-Man and Tri-Klops, the character was initially planned to be a Heroic Warrior.\nIn the 2002 cartoon, he is the younger brother of King Ceratus and betrayed his kind when he sided with Skeletor. This series revealed that he and King Ceratus are Caligars.\nWhiplash was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series and Garry Chalk in the 2002 series.\nWebstor.\nWebstor is a blue-skinned creature with the abilities of a spider. A two-bit thief who resembles a goblin with a grappling hook in the 1980s series. In the 1980s cartoon, he never used the rifle included with the figure.\nIn the 2002 version, he is an Arachna, a spider-like race that are enemies of the Andreenids. He can spin webs, has spider-like legs sprouting from his back, and multiple eyes to make him more spider-like in this show. Webstor initially serves as part of Skeletor's Council of Evil, and is the only one not to abandon him. Webstor is beaten to near-death in his own lair by the Snake Men in \"Web of Evil\" so they may steal his ambrosia-enriched eggs. The Masters find his defeated body on the ground as he tells them what happened.\nWebstor was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series, Brian Dobson in the 2002 series, and Dee Bradley Baker in the 2021 series.\nNOTE: Webstor was voted No.3 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by Topless Robot.\nModern toyline characters (200X).\nMutant Warrior.\nThe Mutant Warrior was the only all-new toy-made character from the 2002 toyline until the appearance of the King Grayskull figure. It is a skeleton monster, with a hollow chest which can be filled with slime. It was included with the Mutant Slime Pit playset.\nClassics toyline characters (2008–2018).\nGygor.\nExclusive to the Classics toyline, Gygor is a super-strong gorilla-like creature with yellow fur and green skin who is the Lord of the Vine Jungle. Shortly after the Great Unrest and Keldor's forces being driven behind the Mystic Wall. Gygor led an army of Beast Men in a series of raids against the long forgotten Castle Grayskull, believing the many tales of its great and mysterious power. It was only through the combined powers of Oo-Larr and the Goddess that Gygor was defeated and placed in a state of suspended animation. Eventually, Hordak returned to Eternia and Gygor was freed by Evil-Lyn in her attempt to bolster Skeletor's forces against the new Horde army.\nHis toy is based on an unproduced prototype from the vintage Masters toyline.\nIcer.\nOriginating in the Filmation cartoon, Icer is Skeletor's northern agent who can freeze someone and dissolve into water to get under tight spots. His only cartoon appearance involved him raiding an arctic base to steal an invention that was guarded there. Icer does not like heat.\nIcer did not have a toy made of him until the collector-centric \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" series.\nIcer was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series.\nFang Man.\nOriginating in the Filmation cartoon, Fang Man is a dragonoid who appeared in one episode \"The Time Corridor\". He has power to control dragon-like creatures called Dragosaurs. He was left in the past with Tri-Klops and was never seen in another episode again, yet Tri-klops was. Some sources state that he is a Snake Man known as \"Fang-Shu\". He is possibly the prototype of Kobra Khan of the Snake Men, who was released as a figure as he can squirt mist from his mouth.\nHe did not have a toy made of him until the Collector-centric \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" series which stated that he was evolved from an ancient Dragosaur species and confirmed that Fang Man was left in the past. The bio for that toy also states that Fang Man resides with his ancestors on Dragosaur Isle awaiting the return of Skeletor.\nFang Man was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series.\nBatros.\nOriginating in the Filmation cartoon, Batros is an anthropomorphic bat who resides on the dark side of Eternia. He has helped Skeletor out, although he is generally an independent villain and will not officially ally himself with any evil team.\nHe did not have a toy made of him, until the Masters of the Universe \"Classics\" line. The symbol over his chest straps strongly resembles the Horde's red bat-winged insignia. That and the fact that an origin episode for the Sorceress featuring 3 aliens wearing Horde uniforms and flying in Horde ships leads many to assume that he may have been one of several teasers for the upcoming \"\" series.\nBatros was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series.\nStrongarm.\nOriginating in the Filmation cartoon, Strongarm is a cyborg with a long metal right arm with strength that can rival He-Man's. He only appeared in \"She Demon of Phantos.\"\nStrongarm did not have a toy made of him until the Collector-centric \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" series where he was referred to as \"Strong-Or.\" His bio in that toyline stated that Strongarm was originally Dalmus Fu, a photanium mines worker on Phantos who lost his right arm and parts of his face when a mechanical press folder malfunctioned. After being banished from Phantos by Queen Elmora for the photanium thefts where he used some of them to build a new face and right arm, he sided with Skeletor.\nStrongarm was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series.\nDraego-Man.\nA fire-breathing dragon man with flame weapons, Draego-Man is one of Skeletor's newest Evil Warriors. After being shunned by Granamyr, Draego-Man sided with the people of Eternia. After the Truce of the Three Towers, Draego-Man became so disgusted with the humans that he chose to isolate himself within the Caverns of Rakash. Many millenniums later, Draego-Man came out of hiding where he sided with Skeletor in his plot to enslave the dragons and use them in the Evil Warriors' attack on the Royal Palace of Eternia.\nExclusive to the MOTU Classics toyline, he is also the only entirely new character that the Four Horsemen have created for Masters of the Universe.\nGoat Man.\nOriginated in the Golden books, Goat Man is as an ally of Beast Man.\nAccording to his 2014 Classics action figure packaging, Goat Man is Klacky, a member of the G’hoat Men from the Northern Mountains where his kind are one of the only intelligent upright races that is susceptible to the hypnotic powers of Beast Man. Like most of his species, Klacky was captured by the rulers of the Vine Jungle and simply called \"Goat Man\" by his beastly masters. Eventually, he found himself in the service of Beast Man and was forced to serve in the Second Ultimate Battle. Here, he was severely wounded by Buzz-Off and left at the foot of Central Tower. Crawling inside, Goat Man fell into a time portal and was transported to the future arriving on Eternia when King He-Man ruled the land and his son Dare wielded the Power Sword. Forced to serve an aging Beast Man in this new time, Goat Man is forever following whatever evil orders he is given.\nGoat Man is voiced by Kevin Smith in \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\".\nAnti-Eternia He-Man.\nDebuting in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, the Anti-Eternia He-Man is a He-Man from an alternate Eternia called Anti-Eternia where he is a villain. Using the World Converter, Skeletor summoned Anti-Eternia He-Man to Eternia.\nHover Robots.\nAlso known as \"Robot Knights\", Skeletor used dozens of these floating mechanical minions to bolster his Evil Warriors. Their claw-like hands could spin like saw blades, but they were no match for the might of He-Man. Created for the Filmation cartoon, a set of three Hover Robots action figures were released in 2015 as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nKarg.\nKarg (portrayed by Robert Towers) is a half-human, half-bat minion of Skeletor with a hook for a left hand. Karg commands Skeletor's Robot Centurions. He appeared in the 1987 live-action movie in a role that was originally intended for Trap Jaw.\nKarg gained an action figure in 2018 as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline. His bio states that Karg is Skeletor's interrogator at Snake Mountain and is served by the Mintoran cyborg Minox. In addition, Karg also works as a bounty hunter and has developed a liking for Lieutenant Andra of the Eternian Royal Guard.\nMovie exclusive villains.\nCreated for the 1987 live-action film, none of these characters had toys made of them.\nThe Horde.\nThe Horde is a fictional intergalactic organization of supervillainous monsters, robots, and sorcerers on Etheria who occupy the land on behalf of their leader, Horde Prime. The Fright Zone serves as their base of operations, with connections on both Etheria and Eternia. While the mysterious Horde Prime is the supreme ruler of the Evil Horde, the technomancer Hordak is its operational commander, and the former mentor of Skeletor. For a list of other Horde members, such as Catra, Grizzlor and Shadow Weaver, see: \nKey Members.\nHordak.\nHordak (Hor-dak) is Skeletor's old master, She-Ra's archenemy, and the Horde's ruthless cyborg commander who conquered most of the planet Etheria. He is the brother of Horde Prime. In the 1980s cartoon series, Hordak is a cyborg who can alter his shape, most often into that of a rocket to make a quick get-away. In the \"Masters of the Universe\" comics Hordak also tries to conquer Eternia, making him a frequent adversary of both He-Man and Skeletor. Hordak is notoriously short-tempered, often abusing his minions (Mantenna in particular, with Hordak constantly sending him down a trap door in his throne room). Despite being evil, Hordak has a sense of humor.\nHowever, in the 2002 series Hordak wished to rule over all of Eternia. After he and his minions defeated the Snake Men, Hordak turned his attention to Castle Grayskull and launched an attack against it. He was defeated by King Grayskull, who banished Hordak and his forces to the Abyss and entrapped them in a dimension within. Somehow, ages later, Hordak became Skeletor's master, despite the dimensional differences. Hordak saves Keldor's life after he is mortally injured battling Randor; in saving his life, Hordak transformed Keldor into Skeletor and told him there would one day be a price to pay for Hordak's assistance. Later in the series, Evil-Lyn and Count Marzo attempt to release Hordak from his dimensional prison.\nUnlike his former pupil Skeletor, Hordak prefers to place his reliance on science and technology, rather than magic. He suffered no fools and expected the highest standards of excellence from his minions, rewarding them when they succeeded and punishing them severely when they failed.\nHordak serves as the main antagonist for the first four seasons of the 2018 reboot \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\". He also makes a cameo appearance in the 2021 \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" as Evilyn's father.\nHis face is a pale flesh color on the figure but pure white in the cartoon. Initially, the figure did not have the left cannon arm as he did in the cartoon. The figure just had two normal arms. However, later variants of Hordak gave him a variety of cyborg-like mechanical gimmicks, reminiscent of the shape-changing powers he displayed in the 1980s cartoon.\nHordak is voiced by George DiCenzo in the 1980s series, Colin Murdock in the 2002 \"He-Man\" series, Keston John in the 2018 \"She-Ra\" series, and Kevin Conroy in the 2021 \"He-Man\" series.\nThe Snake Men.\nThe Snake Men are another evil faction, who sought to conquer Eternia in its ancient past, and after centuries of imprisonment are brought to the present with a vengeance.\nThe \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline states that the Snake Men were created from the DNA splicing of three cold-blooded alien races (like the Klybian Lizard Men) and were bred by the Unnamed One.\nFang-Or.\nFirst appearing in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Fang-Or is a vicious Snake Man who can regrow his fangs after launching them like knives in battle. He became a mechanical expert after assisting the Snake Man form of Man-At-Arms where he built the Rattle Trap for King Hiss.\nKing Hiss.\nRuler of the Snake Men, King Hiss can shed his human-like \"skin\" to become a twisting mass of five headed Hydra/Shesha-like snakes from the waist up. In the 2002 series, The Sorceress describes King Hiss as wielding magic as great of that of the Elders. King Hiss was defeated by Hordak and his minions in the times of King Grayskull. Ages later, King Hiss and his henchmen were sealed away beneath Snake Mountain (which Hiss built) by Zodak, to be released during the reign of King Randor by Kobra Khan, General Rattlor, and Evil-Lyn. In the unproduced Episode 40 of the 2002 series, his name is spelled \"King Hsss.\" The new 2002 version is his belated cartoon appearance as he never appeared in the original 1980s cartoon as it ceased production by the time Mattel released his figure.\nKing Hiss appeared in the game \"\".\nKing Hiss was voiced by Brian Dobson in the 2002 series.\nNOTE: King Hiss was voted No. 11 in The 14 Least Masterful Masters of the Universe by Io9. Comic Book Resources listed the character as part of He-Man: 15 Most Powerful Masters of the Universe.\nKobra Khan.\nKobra Khan is a cobra-type Snake Man whose character pre-dates the introduction of the Snake Men. He appears as one of Skeletor's Evil Warriors in the \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" animated series, in which he sprays a sleeping gas, and on one occasion, is shown to have stretchable arms similar to the Sssqueeze character. In the series, the gas came from vents in his hood, which he kept down any time he was not using this ability. The action figure and minicomics portrayed the character spraying this gas from his mouth. The toy had a mechanism that converted water to vapor similar to many kinds of spray bottles.\nIn the 2002 animated series, he instead sprays acid. The cunning and silver-tongued Kobra Khan is fanatically devoted to King Hiss at the expense of loyalty to his erstwhile allies, earning him resentment. He freed General Rattlor in his first attempt to release his monarch. The other Snake Men would often try to get Kobra Khan to prove himself to be a true Snake-Man by eating a human. In the event that someone is hit in the eyes with Kobra Khan's acid attack, a special spray can be used to counter it.\nIn the Mattel mini-comics and UK comics, Kobra Khan shares a dual-allegiance to Skeletor and King Hiss.\nKobra Khan was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series and Scott McNeil in the 2002 series.\nKobra Khan was voted No.5 in The 12 Coolest Masters of the Universe Action Features by Topless Robot. Comic Book Resources listed the character as He-Man: Eternia's 15 Mightiest Villains.\nLord Gr'asp.\nFirst appearing in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Gr'asp is a viper-type Snake Man with a crushing crab-like claw for a right-hand who is a master strategist. He was originally an elite general of the Unnamed One until he escapes from the Nameless Dimension. After forming an alliance with Horde Prime, he persuaded him to destroy the Kaydex Crystal that kept the Unnamed One trapped in the Nameless Dimension. It was Lord Gr'asp that persuaded Hordak and King Hiss to work together.\nMegator.\nMegator was a green giant from Preternia. The original toy was one of the few releases in The Powers of Grayskull spin-off line. It was only sold in Italy.\nHis modern \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" action figure packaging states that he originally served Hordak during Preternian times and was resurrected by King Hiss after his death to serve the Snake Men in the modern day.\nRattlor.\nOne of King Hiss' generals, Rattlor is a rattlesnake-type Snake Man who possesses an extending neck and rattling tail. He appears in the \"She-Ra: Princess of Power\" animated series as a member of the Horde, as the He-Man cartoon series ended when his figure was made. In the 2002 animated series, Rattlor is presented as the General of the Snake Men army trying to release their leader, King Hiss. He was released by Kobra Khan but later recaptured and held in the Eternian prison. Gen. Rattlor nursed a grudge against Kobra Khan for being left to this fate, escaping only by outwitting Roboto. He retains a primordial fear of mongooses.\nRattlor was voiced by Lou Scheimer in the 1980s series and Richard Newman in the 2002 series.\nSnake Face.\nSnake Face is a gorgon-type Snake Man. Snakes extend from his face, chest and shoulders to \"petrify\" opponents (just like Medusa of Greek mythology).\nHe only appears in the 1980s comics and 2002 animated series because the original animated series had ended by the time his figure was released. During the return of the Snake Men, Snake Face was beaten by He-Man who used his shield as a mirror and turned Snake Face's power back on him, turning him to stone. The petrified Snake Face is seen later in the Eternian prison. In the episode 40 comic \"Captured,\" it is shown that Snake Men can recover from even mortal injuries when they are in total darkness, as both the stone Snake Face and the decapitated King Hiss were taken to Snake Mountain where Skeletor's minion Beast Man inadvertently allowed King Hiss to heal himself. This implies that Snake Face too would eventually have been restored to normal.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Snake Face gained his petrifying abilities from the Great Black Wizard with his abilities impressing King Hiss enough to recruit him into his army as part of the Snake Men's inner circle.\nSnake Face was voiced by Paul Dobson in the 2002 version.\nSssqueeze.\nSssqueeze is an anaconda-type Snake Man who possesses long snake-like arms.\nHe only appears in the 2002 version of the cartoon because the original 1980s cartoon ended when his figure was released. In the 2002 series, the palms of his hands became snake-like heads when Sssqueeze's arms are extended. Sssqueezes is sometimes called Tanglor in certain media, which was his original prototype name.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Sssqueeze serves as one of King Hiss' chief lieutenants.\nSssqueeze was voiced by Brian Dobson in the 2002 series.\nNOTE: Sssqueeze was No.9 in 10 Weird Masters Of The Universe Action Figures From The 1980s.\nTerroar.\nFirst appearing the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Terroar is a sound being from Melodian who was exiled for his evil deeds. When the spacecraft containing him crashed into Eternia's Ice Mountains, he was inert for a millennia until a skirmish between the Evil Warriors, the Horde, and the Snake Men freed them. Terroar systematically assimilated the characteristics of their warriors where he assumed a purple-skinned hybrid appearance where he has the head of Whiplash, the extending neck, torso, left arm, and tail of Rattlor, the right arm and shoulder of Trap Jaw, and the legs and boots of Mosquitor. The Evil Warriors, the Horde, and the Snake Men confronted Terroar who unleashed his devastating roar that brought them to their knees. King Hiss became impressed with Terroar's talents and prevented Quick Flick from slaying him. Lord Gr'asp later found Terroar in the Ice Valley of Death. Upon remembering King Hiss' kindness, Terroar sided with the Snake Men. Plasmor, Slamurai, and Strobo later discovered that Terroar had a weakness to prolonged light exposure.\nTung Lashor.\nTung Lashor is a python-type Snake Man who possesses a super-long extending tongue. He appears in the She-Ra: Princess of Power animated series as a member of the Horde. In the episode Gateway to Trouble, he works with Skeletor and Modulok to make the gate maker. The original He-Man cartoon had ceased production when his figure was released.\nIn the 2002 animated series \"Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen\", Tung Lashor is a member of the Snake Men. A recurring gag in the 2002 series is that Tung Lashor's tongue would occasionally get cut off and grow back by the next appearance.\nIn the 2018 animated series \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\", Tung Lashor is leader of the Crimson Wasteland Snake Men before he was defeated by Catra who left him in quicksand and took his men.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Tung Lashor is depicted as having venom on this tongue.\nTung Lashor was voiced by George DiCenzo in the 1980s series, Michael Donovan in the 2002 series, and Jake Eberle in \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\".\nSnake Man Soldiers.\nIn addition to his key lieutenants, King Hiss also has a huge army of slithering minions willing to do his bidding. The 2002 series featured the full force of the Snake Men and two action figures based on these generic warriors (one yellow, one orange) were released in 2012 for Mattel's \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nSnake Troopers.\nFirst appearing in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, the Snake Troopers are the results of some Snake Men Warriors that were with Lord Gr'asp being subjected to Horde World science where they were lobotomized, turned into cyborgs, and hooked up to the central computer brain of the Horde Troopers. The Snake Troopers were used in Lord Gr'asp's plans to have the Snake Men partner up with the Horde.\n\"The New Adventures of He-Man characters\" (1989–1992, 2010–2015).\nGalactic Guardians.\nHydron.\nHydron is an undersea commander and the captain of Starship Eternia.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Hydron was released in 2014.\nFlipshot.\nFlipshot is a space pilot from the cloud city of Levitan. He is also known as Icarius in the toyline.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Icarius was released in 2011.\nMara of Primus.\nMara is an assistant of Master Sebrian, ambassador of the planet Primus, and eventually becomes the leader of the Galactimytes.\nShe has her hair in a long braid, with a spiked metal ball at the end which she uses as a weapon. A prototype action figure was created but not put into production.\nIn 2015, a new figure of Mara was released as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline.\nMara of Primus also appears to have been the inspiration for the Mara character in the 2018 \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\" series, although no official link between the characters has yet been made.\nSpace Mutants.\nFlogg.\nFlogg is the leader of the Evil Mutants of Denebria. Flogg is a military commander of the Mutant Armada which he commands from the Mutant Mothership. Skeletor forges an alliance with Flogg where Skeletor will help him take over Primus in exchange for Flogg helping to destroy He-Man. By the end of the series, Flogg surrenders and ends up signing a peace treaty between Primus and Denebria.

He serves as Flogg's second-in-command and the co-pilot of the Mutant Mothership. Slush Head comes from the Quagmi Swamp, a place on Denebria that most other Mutants find disgusting because of its deadly creatures and foul stench. In the toyline, he is also called Kalamarr.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Slush Head was released in 2012. He is also the only mutant who is married.\nOptikk.\nOptikk is a cyborg with a single giant eyeball for a head.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Optikk was released in 2010.\nKaratti.\nKaratti is a green-skinned mutant with deadly martial arts skills who is often paired with Hoove.\nA \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" figure of Karatti was released in 2013.\nOther villains associated with MOTU.\nSkeletor, Hordak, and King Hiss are not the only threats to Eternia. There are many independent and freelance villains who have made their own attempts at threatening the peace on Eternia.\nCount Marzo.\nCount Marzo is a powerful sorcerer who has lived for thousands of years with no greater desire than to become King of Eternia. He concocts his evil schemes more subtly than most villains and often entices children, into aiding his plots. He was never made as a figure in the 1980s.\nIn the 1980s series, Count Marzo first appeared in \"The Once and Future Duke\" where he reverted Teela's friend David (who is also Count Marzo's nephew) to a child and wiped his memory to keep him from becoming Duke of Athra. In addition, he is served by Chimera. He-Man was able to defeat Count Marzo. In \"The Eternia Flower,\" Count Marzo tricks Jahno into giving him an Eternian Flower which he uses to turn Jahno's friends against him and gather an army of children. After the Wolfbats he unleashed on He-Man are defeated, Count Marzo and Chimera flee to their home planet of Eronia to continue mass-producing the Eternian Flower. He-Man thwarted their plans and defeated them. In \"Search for a Son,\" Mekaneck learns that Count Marzo had rescued his son Philip from a storm in the forest. Count Marzo manipulates Mekaneck into leading King Randor and Queen Marlena to an oasis where he captures them. He-Man defeats Count Marzo and Chimera, but they get away.\nIn the 2002 series, Count Marzo is a barbaric wizard with an Eastern European accent. His powers come from a magenta crystal that makes up his amulet. Deprived of his powers and affected by the magic of the Council of Elders, he becomes a hunched and wizened peasant. Several times in the 2002 series, Marzo's amulet is taken away from him, only to be returned later. Marzo aids Evil-Lyn with her plan to restore Hordak in exchange for his amulet, which Evil-Lyn possesses. This plot was thwarted by He-Man, though Count Marzo escapes.\nA toy was released in 2010 based on his newer design as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline. His bio lists him as a 5th degree wizard from the Dunes of Doom and led the warriors of the Dark Hemisphere in fighting the armies of Miro. Count Marzo was listed in the bios of Nepthu and Prahvus where they had connections with him. In addition, Count Marzo was the one who created the Shadow Beasts as revealed in its toy bio.\nComic Book Resources listed the character as He-Man: Eternia's 15 Mightiest Villains. Comic Book Resources voted Count Marzo 7th Most Useless He-Man Characters To Ever Appear On-Screen.\nCount Marzo was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series and Michael Donovan in the 2002 series.\nEvilseed.\nEvilseed is an evil plant man who can control plants.\nIn the 1980s series, He-Man and Skeletor team up to stop him.\nIn the 2002 series, he is an evil rival to Moss Man who was imprisoned in the Root Cellar by Moss Man until the day when Evilseed tricked Orko.\nAn action figure based on the 2002 version of Evilseed was released in 2015 as part of the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline. His bio states that he was created by Moss Man and went rogue.\nEvilseed was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series and Don Brown in the 2002 series.\nPrahvus.\nPrahvus was an evil grey-skinned warlord with horns and blue tattoo-like markings. He only appeared in the 2002 series, attempting to conquer Eternia during a time known as the Great Unrest. He had many weapons and an entire army of his own. On one of these plots, he attacked Pelezia upon being brought there by Odiphus. Prahvus was defeated by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, sometime before she gave birth to Teela.\nThe creators of the cartoon confirmed that had there been a third season, Prahvus would have returned as a member of The Horde.\nIn the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline, Prahvus' bio mentioned that he was originally imprisoned in a magical lamp until he was freed by Count Marzo to help fight Miro during the Great Unrest. He was defeated by Keldor who imprisoned him in the magical lamp again. Decades later, Hordak found the magical lamp containing Prahvus where two of his minions freed him and he was enthralled by Hordak's chief witch.\nShokoti.\nShokoti is an extremely powerful undead sorceress who resides in the Sands of Time. She only appears once in the entire Masters of the Universe cartoon series, but is noteworthy due to the fact that she nearly defeats He-Man. She has a rather demonic appearance, with a horned headdress, jet-black hair, pale bluish skin and black, lifeless eyes. Her sole episode, \"The House of Shokoti, part 2\", is considered one of the darkest episodes in the series.\nIn 2013, a figure of Shokoti along with one of her Darklings were made into toy form in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" line.\nShokoti was voiced by Linda Gary in the 1980s series.\nNepthu.\nThe evil sorcerer Nepthu originally appeared in the Filmation episode \"Temple of The Sun\".\nHe was released in action figure form in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline in 2013.

Nepthu later sided with King Hiss during the Second Ultimate Battle Ground.\nGeldor.\nGeldor is a barbarian who appeared in the minicomic \"The Secret Liquid of Life\".\nA fan favourite, he was voted into the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline as the 2013 \"Fan's Choice\" action figure.\nPlundor.\nAn evil rabbit-man motivated purely by greed, Plundor first appeared in the Filmation cartoon. He conquered the planet Trannis with his army of robots, turning its lush environment into a wasteland, all because he wanted to plunder its natural resources for profit.\nA Plundor action figure was released in the \"Masters of the Universe Classics\" toyline in 2013.\nPlundor was voiced by John Erwin in the 1980s series.\nLodar.\nLodar is the main villain of the minicomic \"Slave City\" which said minicomic was an adaptation of an episode of the TV series titled \"A Tale of Two Cities\".

        "title": "Oman national cricket team",
        "text": "The Oman men's national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Oman in international matches and is governed by Oman Cricket, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000, and gained associate status in 2014. The national side has played matches at the Twenty20 International level. On 24 April 2019, Oman achieved One-Day International status for the first time until 2023, after they beat tournament hosts Namibia by four wickets in 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two.\nOman's first competitive matches came during the 2002 ACC Trophy, and the side has since participated in many Asian Cricket Council tournaments, finishing as runners-up in the 2004 ACC Trophy and twice winning the ACC Twenty20 Cup. Oman has participated in ICC World Cup Qualifier without qualifying for the final tournament, placing ninth at the 2005 ICC Trophy and eleventh at the 2009 World Cup Qualifier. In July 2015, with their win against Namibia in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, Oman gained Twenty20 International status and qualified for 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, its first major international tournament.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Oman and other ICC Members after 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.\nMost cricket in Oman is played by expatriate Indians and Pakistanis (and their descendants), rather than by native Omanis – in 2010, only 100 of the 780 players (around 13 per cent) in the national league were Arabs.\nHistory.\nEarly years and ICC Membership.\nOman became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2000. Their senior international debut came at the 2002 ACC Trophy where they failed to progress beyond the first round, with their only win coming against Qatar. A huge improvement was shown in the 2004 tournament when they reached the final, where they lost against the United Arab Emirates. This qualified them for the 2005 ICC Trophy, the final qualification stage for the 2007 World Cup. It also qualified them for the Asia Cup in 2006. Later in 2004, they won the Middle East Cup after a tied game against Bahrain. They won the tournament as they beat Bahrain in the group stage. In the 2014 ACC Premier League in Malaysia they reached 4th place with three wins.\n2005 ICC Trophy and aftermath.\nIn 2005, Oman became the first affiliate member of the ICC to compete in the ICC Trophy. Despite being the mystery men of the tournament, they lost all their group games, but then won their play-off games against Uganda and the USA, the latter when they successfully chased down a mammoth target of 345, featuring an unbroken 127-run partnership for the eighth wicket. This gave them ninth place out of the twelve teams in the competition, enough to earn a place in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League in 2007.\n2006 saw a drop in form for Oman, as they were eliminated in the first round of the ACC Trophy, with their only win coming against the Maldives. As mentioned above, they were originally scheduled to participate in the Asia Cup in 2006, playing their first ODIs against Pakistan and India. However, this tournament was postponed until 2008, and the ACC decided to use the 2006 ACC Trophy as a qualification tournament, meaning that Oman's place was taken by Hong Kong.\n2007–2013.\nIn October/November 2007, Oman took part in the inaugural ACC Twenty20 Cup held in Kuwait, where they played in Group A against; Afghanistan, Malaysia, Nepal and Qatar. Oman finished in the top two of their group and qualified for the semi-final stage. Oman beat Kuwait in their semi-final, then shared the tournament after the final match against Afghanistan was tied.\nIn November 2007, Oman travelled to Namibia to take part in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League. They played Denmark, the hosts and the UAE in addition to the two qualifiers from Division Three; Uganda and Argentina. Although Oman won all their group matches, they lost to the UAE in the final. On the basis of their top four finish in this tournament, Oman qualified for the ICC World Cup Qualifier in 2009, the final tournament in qualification for the 2011 World Cup.\nIn January 2009, Oman participated in the ACC Cup, Challenge tournament in Chiang Mai, Thailand. They came first with ease, defeating the Maldives and Bhutan in the Semi finals and finals respectively. The fourth favourites to win the cup were hosts, Thailand who ended up in fourth place.\nIn April 2009, Oman travelled to South Africa to participate in the ICC World Cup Qualifier, the final tournament in qualification for the 2011 World Cup. During the tournament Oman finished last in their group and in the 11th place playoff they beat Denmark by 5 wickets.\nIn the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, Oman were drawn in Group B. In the group stages of the competition it won all five of its games, finishing top of the group and qualifying for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals it lost to the United Arab Emirates, therefore missing out on a chance to win back-to-back titles. In the third place playoff, it defeated Kuwait. This victory enabled Oman to claim the final qualifying spot for the cricket tournament at the 2010 Asian Games. They played in 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 3rd to remain in 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three.\n2014 onwards: Associate Membership and ODI and T20I status.\nAt the ICC Annual Conference, held in Melbourne, Australia, in June 2014, the Oman Cricket Board was upgraded from an affiliate member of the ICC to an associate member. That announcement came during the 2014 WCL Division Four, where Oman placed fifth to be relegated to the 2016 Division Five event. Despite the team's poor performance in the 50-over format, Oman went on to win its next major international tournament, the 2015 ACC Twenty20 Cup, thus qualifying for 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland.\nBy defeating Namibia in a sudden-death match at the World Twenty20 Qualifier, Oman reached the top six teams at the tournament, thus qualifying for the 2016 World Twenty20 and gaining Twenty20 International status until at least 2019. The team made its T20I debut in the fifth-place play-off against Afghanistan, and later in the year played bilateral T20I series against Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and United Arab Emirates. \nIn 2016 Oman appeared at the 2016 World Twenty20 in India where they recorded an upset victory over Ireland.\nThey also appeared at the 2016 Asia Cup Qualifier.\nIn January 2017 Oman took part in the 2017 Desert T20 Challenge. They reached the semi-finals of the tournament by beating Hong Kong in the group stages, before being defeated by Afghanistan.\nIn April 2019, Oman gained ODI status for the first time, until at least 2022.\nOn 19 June 2023, Oman played their first-ever ODI match against a test playing nation. Oman faced Ireland in 4th match of the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. They restricted Ireland to a score of 281/7 in 50 overs, and they chased down this target in 48.1 overs thanks to Kashyap Prajapati's 72 (74). This marked Oman's first ODI victory against a full member nation.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all players who were in the most recent ODI or T20I squads. &lt;br&gt; \"Updated as on 14 April 2023\"\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational match summary — Oman\n\"Last updated 21 April 2024\"\nOne-Day Internationals.\nMost ODI runs for Oman\nMost ODI wickets for Oman\nODI record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to ODI #4614.

        "title": "George Webster (American football)",
        "text": "George Delano Webster (November 25, 1945 – April 19, 2007) was an American professional football player who was a linebacker in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) with the Houston Oilers, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the New England Patriots. Webster played college football for the Michigan State Spartans. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987.\nCollege career.\nWebster was recruited to play at Michigan State University. He would play as a defensive back (specifically a \"roverback\", as created by head coach Duffy Daugherty) from 1964 to 1966, which would see him play as a combination of safety and linebacker who could run with wide receivers but be strong enough to take on any running back. His Spartan teams compiled a 23–6–1 record, including the famous 10–10 tie against Notre Dame on November 19, 1966, and won a share of the national championship in 1965 (UPI &amp; National Football Foundation) and 1966 (NFF tie with Notre Dame). Among the honors given to Webster were being named to the All-Big Ten Conference and All-American teams in 1965 and 1966, his number 90 was the second to be retired by the university, and he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987. In 1999, Webster was named one of the starting safeties on \"Sports Illustrated\"'s NCAA football all-century team. His contributions at Michigan State are highlighted in the documentary \"Through the Banks of the Red Cedar\", written and directed by MSU teammate Gene Washington's daughter, Maya Washington.\nProfessional career.\nAfter being selected by the American Football League's Houston Oilers as the fifth player overall in the first round of the 1967 draft, Webster's position was changed. In an exhibition game against the Cowboys, opposing quarterback Don Meredith completed a square-out to \"Bullet\" Bob Hayes, a former Olympic speedster. Hayes thought he had broken into the open, but was brought down from behind by Webster.\nWebster started at left linebacker and made 15 tackles in his first AFL game. He made his first pro interception that year, helping the Oilers win the Eastern Division title. He was part of a defensive unit that held opponents under 200 points for the season. Webster averaged more than ten tackles a game, and was named the UPI AFL Rookie of the Year. He was named to the AFL All-Star Game three times (1967, 1968, and 1969). Webster's talent on the field was so evident that he was named a member of the American Football League All-Time Team (one of three selected for first-team linebackers) in 1970 despite playing just three seasons in the AFL, as noted by his talent in speed and quickness as a \"roverback\". Teammate Elvin Bethea once called Webster \"one of the greatest linebackers who ever lived\".\nHis fourth season with the Oilers saw him suffer a knee injury that curtailed his speed. He played one more season with Houston before playing with Pittsburgh and New England to end his career.\nPost-career disability and death.\nIn 1989, Webster applied for benefits as totally and permanently disabled. He was found to have lost most use of a hand, foot, knee and ankle due to football-related injuries but did not meet the NFL's definition of totally disabled. In 1998, the Supreme Court let stand a finding by the NFL's retirement board that Webster's disability was not related to his football career. Football-related disability benefits are $4,000 a month; non-football disability monthly benefits are $750.\nIn 2002, Webster had his right leg amputated above the knee in Houston because the limb had little circulation despite five previous surgeries. He also dealt with throat and prostate cancer in his later years. In February 2007, he had a scholarship fund established in his name. On April 19, 2007, Webster died in Houston."

        "title": "History of Pawtucket Baseball",
        "text": "Professional baseball was played in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, for 67 years spanning 1892 through 2019.\nBefore World War I.\nThe first team to call Pawtucket home, the Pawtucket Secrets of the New England League, disbanded on July 26, 1892 with a dismal 17–43 record. The team played its games on the Dexter Street grounds, which housed two other Pawtucket teams in the New England League through 1899.\nFollowing the Secrets (1892), the Pawtucket Maroons (1894–1895, 1897–1899) and Pawtucket Phenoms (1896) called Pawtucket home. After the Maroons were expelled in August 1899, Pawtucket would be without baseball until 1908, although the Pawtucket Colts of the Class C Atlantic Association lasted only nine games before disbanding and leaving Pawtucket without a team for six more seasons.\nIn 1914 the Pawtucket Rovers joined the Class C Colonial League, playing their games at the Sabin Street grounds in the Royal Square area, but were kicked out in August 1915 because of an affiliation with a competing league.\nThe city did not field a team in Organized Baseball from that point through 1945.\nWorld War II through 2020.\nNew England League (1946–1949).\nMcCoy Stadium, named in honor of Thomas P. McCoy, mayor of Pawtucket from 1936 to 1945, was dedicated just in time for the return of professional baseball in 1946 as the Pawtucket Slaters of the Class B New England League, an affiliate of the Boston Braves of the National League, debuted. The Slaters lasted four full seasons; they led the New England League in attendance (92,787) in 1947, made the league playoffs every season, and compiled a composite record of 279–221 (a winning percentage of .558). However, after the 1949 campaign, the league disbanded and eight-year-old McCoy Stadium was left without a permanent tenant.\nEastern League (1966–1967, 1970–1972).\nThat would change in 1966 when the Cleveland Indians' Double-A Eastern League team relocated from Reading, Pennsylvania, to become the Pawtucket Indians. The Tribe spent two seasons in Pawtucket, compiling a record of 135–142, before moving to Waterbury, Connecticut. But professional baseball, and the Eastern League, would return to McCoy in 1970 when the Pittsfield Red Sox transferred to the city—beginning a 50-year relationship with the Boston Red Sox and creating the Pawtucket Red Sox, popularly nicknamed the \"PawSox.\"\nInternational League (1973–2019).\nAfter three seasons (1970–72) as the host to Boston's Eastern League affiliate, Pawtucket became home to Boston's Triple-A operation with the 1973 transfer of the Louisville Colonels of the International League. The 1973 PawSox were the first Pawtucket team ever to win a Governors' Cup championship, a feat they would repeat in 1984, 2012 and 2014. They also led the International League in attendance in 2004, 2005 and 2008. However, the \"PawSox\" moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2021 after the team and the Rhode Island General Assembly could not agree on a financing plan for a new ballpark that had been proposed for downtown Pawtucket. The team played its final game in September 2019, with its planned farewell season, 2020, falling victim to the shutdown of minor league baseball due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncluding both their Eastern League and International League editions, the Pawtucket Red Sox' regular season record over the half-century of their existence was 3,461–3,610, for a winning percentage of .490."

        "title": "Hollywood Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Hollywood Cricket Club (HCC) is an amateur cricket club in Los Angeles, California. It is a member of the Southern California Cricket Association. The club was formed in 1932 by British actor and cricketer C. Aubrey Smith.\nAbout.\nSmith learned to play cricket at Charterhouse School and was on the same team as Lord Hawke and the three Studd brothers at the University of Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Smith also played for Sussex. In his prime, he played against W. G. Grace and with The Champion on the \"Gentlemen versus Players\" games held annually between the best amateur and professional cricketers in Britain at Lord's. In 1887 Smith toured Australia with an England team that included Andrew Stoddart. Both players resorted to playing Rugby in New Zealand to earn passage back to England. This was the start of British Lions tours to the Antipodes. Ref (Sentence, P.David, Cricket in America 1710-2000) In 1889 Smith captained the England team in South Africa which introduced the Currie Cup, a competition that continues to this day in South Africa.\nSmith went to Hollywood in 1929 and teamed up with Boris Karloff of the Overseas Cricket Club to teach cricket at UCLA in 1932. The same year Arthur Mailey's Australian team captained by Vic Richardson played Smith's team of British actors at UCLA. Smith scored 24 runs against Don Bradman's team. The publicity from the Australians' North American cricket tour was put to good effect with the founding of the Hollywood Cricket Club and the securing of a permanent cricket ground at Griffith Park in Burbank.\nA photograph of the Hollywood Cricket Club taken at UCLA in 1932 includes H. B Warner (with whom Smith used to play cricket for the Actors' XI in England), Boris Karloff and Harrow-educated Frank Somerset, who later became secretary of the Screen Actors' Guild (also founded in May 1933). P. G. Wodehouse was Hollywood CC's first secretary—in the same year as he became the highest-paid script writer in Hollywood. Psmith, featured in stories such as \"The Golden Bat\" before Wodehouse invented the character of Jeeves, was named for a pre-war Warwickshire CCC cricketer. Wodehouse opened the batting for Dulwich College, but his field tenure with HCC was limited due to script-writing commitments.\nThe Hollywood Cricket Club built a pavilion at the ground which still stands, though it has since been turned into a wedding reception center at the Burbank Equestrian Center. The original Griffith Park ground had four pitches and it was officially opened on 23 May 1933 with Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Director Williamson as the guest of honor.

        "text": "Glenn Dee Hubbard (born September 25, 1957) is an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for the Atlanta Braves and Oakland Athletics from 1978 to 1989. He was a MLB All-Star in 1983. Hubbard coached for the Braves from 1999 to 2010.\nPlaying career.\nHubbard attended Wheatland High School, just outside Beale AFB, California, where his father was stationed. He finished high school at Ben Lomond High School when his father moved to Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah. Out of high school, he was a 20th round selection in the 1975 MLB draft. The Braves promoted him to the major leagues in 1978. Hubbard hit his first major league home run on September 23, .\nIn 1983, Hubbard had his best season; he hit .263 with 14 home runs and 70 runs batted in (RBIs) as he earned his only All-Star Game appearance. During his 7th inning at-bat, announcers Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola made numerous light-hearted comments,even calling him Old Mother Hubbard,about his full beard, as beards were not in fashion at the time. Hubbard got a single when he hit a hard grounder to another first-time All-Star, Cal Ripken. The ball took a wicked hop that Ripken couldn't handle.\nHubbard was known more for his fielding than his hitting. His willingness to stand in while turning a double play with a runner coming at him and his steady glove made him very valuable for the Braves. He holds Braves' team fielding records for second basemen in all categories. He was also an excellent bunter and in 1982 he led the National League in sacrifice hits.\nHubbard's most notable trading card is the 1984 Fleer version in which he has an eight-foot boa constrictor draped around his neck.\nHubbard's career with the Braves lasted from 1978 to 1987. Hubbard signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics and played with them in 1988 and 1989.\nIn 1,354 games over 12 seasons, Hubbard posted a .244 batting average (1084-for-4441) with 545 runs, 214 doubles, 22 triples, 70 home runs, 448 RBIs, 35 stolen bases, and 539 bases on balls. He recorded a .983 fielding percentage; on defense, he appeared only at second base. In seven postseason games, he hit .238 (5-for-21) with three runs, one RBI and one walk.\nCoaching career.\nHubbard was the Braves' first base coach from 1999 to 2010 under manager Bobby Cox. When Fredi Gonzalez was hired as the Braves manager on October 13, 2010, Hubbard was not offered a position on his staff. The previous hitting coach, Terry Pendleton, replaced him.\nThe Kansas City Royals organization hired Hubbard in 2011. As of the 2015 season Hubbard is now bench coach for the Lexington Legends who operate as the Royals class A team. On June 24, 2016, the Legends held a promotional giveaway with a Glenn Hubbard bobblehead featuring him in a Legends uniform with a boa constrictor draped across his neck, an image made popular by his Fleer baseball card.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)"

        "text": "The County Ground is a cricket venue on Wantage Road in the Abington area of Northampton, England. It is home to Northamptonshire County Cricket Club, and was used by Northampton Town F.C. from 1897 to 1994.\nCricket.\nNorthamptonshire played their first match at the ground in 1886 before competing in the Minor Counties Championship competition between 1895 and 1904, winning the title three times. They were accepted into the County Championship and played their first first-class match at the ground on 5 June 1905. Northamptonshire drew with Leicestershire in a rain-hit match that only permitted 75 overs of play.\nThe County Cricket Ground is known to be a venue which favours spinners, and in the last County Championship game of 2005, Northamptonshire's two spin bowlers Jason Brown and Monty Panesar took all 20 wickets for Northamptonshire.\nThe County Ground hosted two 1999 Cricket World Cup matches: South Africa's victory over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh's first World Cup victory against eventual finalists Pakistan by 62 runs.\nFootball.\nNorthampton Town F.C., also known as 'the Cobblers', played their home games at the County Ground for 97 years, between 1897 and 1994. The football ground only had three sides, with an open side being needed due to the size of the cricket field.\nThe team began in the Northants League, working upward through various leagues before being elected to The Football League in 1920. The team played in all four main divisions during their tenure at the County Ground. Between 1958 and 1965 the team rose from Division 4 all the way to the top tier, the First Division, where they stayed for only one season – 1965–66. Subsequently, the team fell into decline, being relegated to the Fourth Division in 1970 and have played in the third and fourth tiers of the English league ever since.\nOn 7 February 1970, Northampton Town hosted Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round at the County Ground and lost 8–2, with George Best scoring six goals.\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, the team occupied Division 3 and Division 4, finishing at the bottom of the league in 1994. However, they stayed in the league because the stadium at Kidderminster Harriers, the Football Conference winners, did not meet the standard required for promotion. By that stage, however, construction work on the new all-seater Sixfields Stadium had started. The new stadium was still under construction when the 1994–95 season began, and so the club began that season still at the County Ground.\nThe Cobblers played their last game there on 12 October 1994 (a 1–0 league defeat to Mansfield Town), and then moved to Sixfields, a four-sided stadium more suitable for football.\nTrivia.\nSir Elton John played the first ever concert at the County Ground on 25 June 2011. The show lasted for over two and a half hours. Sir Elton was supported by Ed Drewett. Subsequent concerts have included Tom Jones, Olly Murs, Little Mix and Craig David/Rita Ora.\nWhile the two sports clubs shared the ground, the cricket club's address was 'Wantage Road' whereas the football club's address was 'Abington Avenue'."

        "text": "The County Ground in Chelmsford, Essex, has been the official home ground of Essex County Cricket Club since 1967. It is currently known as The Cloud County Ground for sponsorship reasons. It has been used for first-class cricket since 1925 and List A matches since 1969. The capacity is 6,500, mostly in single-tier seating with a single double-tiered stand. The pavilion was completed in the 1970s.\nHistory.\nEssex's first match at the ground took place in June 1925 against Oxford University. and their first County Championship game at Chelmsford was against Somerset in 1926. When the club left its headquarters at Leyton Cricket Ground at the end of the 1933 season they began a period of playing games at various venues around the county, with a week allocated to each. Chelmsford was given two weeks a season but poor attendances led to Essex ceasing to play at the ground after 1956. In 1966 the club purchased the Chelmsford ground for £15,000, with some financial assistance from Warwickshire's Supporters Association, and the ground became Essex's headquarters with home matches returning there from the 1967 season. The pavilion was opened during the 1970 season and the permanent scoreboard at the ground was constructed in 1981.\nIn April 2024, Essex Cricket renamed the two bowling ends of the ground after former players Sir Alastair Cook and Graham Gooch. The River End was renamed to the Sir Alastair Cook End, and the Hayes Close End to the Graham Gooch End.\nDomestic cricket.\nChelmsford is a small ground, and is notoriously difficult to defend a total at in limited overs cricket, demonstrated by the fact that no side has ever defended a score of under 170 in T20 cricket here. Former Essex and England batsman Graham Gooch scored most of his first-class runs there. Graham Napier scored 152 off 58 balls (16 sixes and 10 fours) in a Twenty20 match v Sussex at the ground. The success of Essex County Cricket Club in the shorter versions of the game between 2005 and 2008 led to the attraction of many new fans. Eventually the ground was regularly selling out in Twenty20 and Friends Provident Trophy games.\nThe Ford Motor Company had naming rights for the ground for between 2005 and 2013. From 2017 to 2019 the naming rights to the stadium have been bought by Cloudfm and therefore the ground will be known as the Cloudfm County Ground. The large amount of passionate support Essex receive at this ground has led to it being popularly referred to as 'Fortress Chelmsford'.\nInternational cricket.\n, the venue has hosted six men's One Day International (ODI) matches. The first ODI was played between Australia and India during the 1983 Cricket World Cup and the most recent ODI match was played between Ireland and Bangladesh during the Bangladeshi cricket team against Ireland in England in 2023 series in May 2023, as part of the 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nGround redevelopment since 2010.\nNew development to the ground include the building of new apartment blocks, the construction of a new cricket school, public square and an access bridge from the Chelmsford town centre side of the ground. In 2019 the ground's floodlights were replaced by larger, square floodlights."

In 1999 Gerolsteiner who had previously sponsored the Cologne Cycling Team in 1998 became the title sponsors. The contract with Georg Totschnig in 2001 helped make the team enter Division I. In 2003 the team participated in the Tour de France for the first time.\nThe leader for several seasons was Georg Totschnig, who recorded top 10 finishes in the Tour de France and was an excellent climber. In 2005, Totschnig won stage 14 of the Tour, showing his skill on the 15 km long climb up the Port de Pailhères (2000m at 8.2%).

In August 2008 the team confirmed it will dissolve after the 2008 season, after being unable to find a new sponsor.\nIn October 2008, riders Stefan Schumacher and Bernhard Kohl were tested positive for CERA (continuous erythropoitin receptor activator, a third-generation variant of erythropoietin, aka EPO)."

        "title": "Davy Jones (baseball)",
        "text": "David Jefferson Jones (June 30, 1880 – March 30, 1972), nicknamed \"Kangaroo\", was an outfielder in Major League Baseball. He played fifteen seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers / St. Louis Browns, Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and Pittsburgh Rebels. Jones played with some of the early legends of the game, including Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, Frank Chance, Mordecai Brown, Hugh Duffy and Jesse Burkett. Also, he played part of one year with the Chicago White Sox, where several of his teammates would later be implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Jones was immortalized in the classic 1966 baseball book \"The Glory of Their Times\" by Lawrence Ritter.\nDavy Jones was mostly a platoon rather than a full-time player who was decent with the bat and swift on his feet. He played in the major leagues from to , compiling a .270 career batting average with 1,020 hits.\nEarly years and non-baseball career.\nBorn in Cambria, Wisconsin, as David Jefferson, he later changed his last name to Jones. He attended Dixon College in Dixon, Illinois, on a track and baseball scholarship, and graduated with a degree in law, but instead accepted a contract to play for the Rockford Club in Rockford, Illinois. In 1910, during his playing days, he purchased a drug store in Detroit with his brother, whose education in pharmacy he had paid for, and after retiring from baseball he himself qualified as a pharmacist at the University of Southern California.\nJones was 21 years old when he broke into the big leagues on September 15, 1901, with the Milwaukee Brewers.\nDetroit Tigers.\nJones spent much of his career playing outfield with the Detroit Tigers, alongside Hall of Fame outfielders, Ty Cobb and Wahoo Sam Crawford. With Cobb and Crawford solidly entrenched in the outfield, Jones was forced to battle for the 3rd outfield spot with Matty McIntyre each year from 1906 to 1910.\nAs a speedy leadoff man, he was a reliable run scorer with Cobb and Crawford following him in the lineup. Jones's speed also made him a fine outfielder, with tremendous range. In 1907, he made 282 putouts and had a range factor of 2.45, 58 points higher than the average outfielder of his day. Jones had his best season in . That year, he had a .357 on-base percentage (the best in the American League). He also scored 101 runs, second in the American League behind his teammate Sam Crawford. Jones was also among the AL leaders in 1907 in bases on balls (60) and stolen bases (30). The Tigers advanced to the first of three consecutive World Series in 1907, and Jones batted .353 with a .476 on-base percentage in a losing effort to the Chicago Cubs. In his three World Series for the Tigers, Jones played in 18 games, had a .357 on-base percentage, scored 8 runs, and had a home run in the 1909 Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nGermany Schaefer incident.\nJones is also known for recounting a famous story in \"The Glory of Their Times\" about the early ballplayer/comedian Germany Schaefer. According to Jones, Schaefer was the only player who ever stole first base in a ballgame.\nThe incident evidently took place on September 4, 1908, during a Detroit game versus Cleveland. With Davy Jones on third and Schaefer at first, the double steal was on. But as Schaefer slid into second base safe, the Cleveland catcher held onto the ball. In order to set up the double-steal again, Schaefer took off screaming for first on the next pitch and dove in headfirst in without a play. This stunned the players, fans and umpires, but it was perfectly legal. On the next pitch, the double steal worked.\nIn the same interview, Jones also mentions how, as the lead off batter for the Detroit Tigers, he was the first hitter to face the great pitcher Walter Johnson.\nPost-retirement.\nAt the age of 38, having retired from baseball and running a successful pharmacy in Detroit, Jones was inserted into one game by an old friend who was managing the ball club, Hughie Jennings. Jones attended the final game of the season as a spectator, and since the contest had no bearing on the pennant race, he and a coach were used in the game. The baseball used in that game is in the National Baseball Hall of Fame collection and is inscribed: \"Last ball used in game at Navin Field in last game of season, 1918, caught by Davy Jones. Hit by Jack Collins of the Chicago White Sox. Season ending on Labor Day on account of War.\" The circumstances of the play in which the ball was involved went unrecognized in the official statistical record for more than 85 years."

        "text": "John Arthur Davidson (born February 27, 1953) is a Canadian-American professional ice hockey executive and former player, who serves as president of hockey operations, alternate governor, and interim general manager for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). As a goaltender, he played in the NHL for the St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers, and helped the Rangers reach the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals.\nDavidson was also a long-time hockey broadcaster, and was honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame with the 2009 Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for his contributions to broadcasting.\nPlaying career.\nDavidson grew up in western Canada and played junior hockey in Calgary, Alberta. He was drafted fifth overall in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft, and became the first goalie in NHL history to jump directly from a major junior league to the NHL.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nDavidson split duties with veteran Wayne Stephenson during his rookie year and posted slightly better numbers than the veteran, including a goals-against average of 3.08. Just before the start of his second season, the Blues dealt Stephenson to the Philadelphia Flyers and Davidson became the Blues' starting goaltender. His goals-against average rose to 3.66 that season. The following summer, the Blues traded Davidson and Bill Collins to the New York Rangers for Jerry Butler, Ted Irvine and Bert Wilson.\nNew York Rangers.\nIn New York, Davidson was to share goaltending duties with Ed Giacomin, who had tended goal for the Rangers for the ten previous seasons. However, early in Davidson's first season with the Rangers, the team placed Giacomin on waivers from which he was claimed by the Detroit Red Wings, making Davidson the starting goaltender for the team. He played 56 games for New York that year, the most in his career and a total he was unable to match due to a string of injuries in the years to come. He helped lead the Rangers to the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals despite an injured left knee. He wore jersey numbers 35, 00 and 30. He was the first, and one of only two, NHL players to wear the number 00; after Martin Biron wore it briefly in 1995, the league banned the use of the number.\nDavidson was the inspiration for the song \"Double Vision\" by the rock group Foreigner, released in 1978. Some members of the band who were Rangers fans were watching a Stanley Cup playoff game between the Rangers and the Buffalo Sabres. Davidson was shaken up when the puck hit him on his mask. Later, announcers Jim Gordon and Bill Chadwick said Davidson was suffering from \"double vision.\"\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter retiring due to injury, he joined MSG Network's hockey coverage staff in 1983, and was the color commentator for Rangers games from 1986–87 to 2005–06, working with Sam Rosen. He was known by the nickname \"J.D.\", became one of the most prominent color commentators in the sport, and his hockey insight is so well respected that he currently sits on the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee. Long-time network TV partner Mike Emrick also sits on that committee, and the two shared the 2004 Lester Patrick Trophy for service to hockey in the U.S.\nIn 1994, the Rangers won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 54 years, in the highest-rated game in MSG Network's history; Davidson announced, \"No more 1940, it's gone!\" On January 31, 2014 he was recognized before the Rangers-Islanders game for thirty years of service with the MSG Network, with a special called \"This One Will Last a Lifetime: 30 Years of Sam Rosen\", which was announced at intermission as a present to him by Davidson.\nDavidson has also contributed to NHL coverage on such national television networks as CBC, Fox, ESPN/ABC, NBC/OLN, SportsChannel America, and Global. He served as the lead color commentator, alongside lead play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick, for the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, the \"NHL on Fox\" from 1994–1999, and again for the \"NHL on NBC\" and \"NHL on OLN\" from 2005–2006.\nDavidson was known for his signature phrase \"Oh, baby!\" He was also featured in full motion videos shot for the EA Sports video game \"NHL 97\". He co-authored the book \"Hockey for Dummies\" (of the popular \"For Dummies\" series) with sportswriter John Steinbreder.\nExecutive career.\nDavidson was named president of the St. Louis Blues on June 30, 2006. He left the Blues after agreeing to a buyout of his contract on October 9, 2012.\nHe was named president of the Columbus Blue Jackets on October 24, 2012, and held this position until his resignation on May 17, 2019.\nOn May 17, 2019, Davidson was named president of the New York Rangers. On May 5, 2021, Davidson was fired as president and alternate governor (along with general manager Jeff Gorton) after the Rangers failed to make the playoffs.\nOn May 20, 2021, the Blue Jackets announced that Davidson would return to Columbus as President of Hockey Operations and alternate governor. Davidson agreed to a five-year contract with the team. On February 15, 2024, Davidson was named interim general manager of the Blue Jackets, after the firing of Jarmo Kekalainen.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Triple-A World Series",
        "text": "The Triple-A World Series was an interleague postseason championship series between the league champions of the affiliated Triple-A leagues of Minor League Baseball to determine an overall champion of the classification held in 1983 and from 1998 to 2000.\nThe 1983 Triple-A World Series was held as a round-robin tournament involving the champions of the American Association (AA), International League (IL), and Pacific Coast League (PCL) at Cardinal Stadium in Louisville, Kentucky. A combination of low attendance and the three league presidents being unable to agree on a more suitable location resulted in the cancellation of a proposed 1984 series. Following the disbandment of the AA after the 1997 season, the Triple-A World Series was revived as a contest between the IL and PCL from 1998 to 2000. Held at Cashman Field in Las Vegas, Nevada, the series was discontinued after three years of poor attendance.\nTwo of the four Triple-A World Series were won by International League teams, and two were won by Pacific Coast League teams. The Tidewater Tides (IL) won the initial 1983 series. The New Orleans Zephyrs (PCL) won in 1998, and the Vancouver Canadians (PCL) won in 1999. The Indianapolis Indians (IL) won the final series in 2000.\nHistory.\nPrevious postseason series.\nPeriodically from 1904 to 1975, the champions from the top-classification leagues of Minor League Baseball met in the postseason to determine a champion amongst them. The Little World Series (1904–1931) and Junior World Series (1932–1975) usually consisted of a best-of-seven (or eight) series modeled on the World Series of Major League Baseball. Most often, it was held between the champions of the International League (IL) and the American Association (AA), though the Pacific Coast League (PCL) participated in place of the IL in 1919. Officials from the International League voted to discontinue the series after 1975 due to their playoff teams being weakened by major league call-ups, the unavailability of some stadiums late in the year, high travel expenses, and low attendance, which led to low revenue for team owners.\nTriple-A World Series (1983).\nDuring the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, International League president Harold Cooper conceived the idea of a Triple-A World Series when television stations broadcast Triple-A games in the absence of major league games. In late 1982, Louisville Redbirds owner A. Ray Smith mentioned the idea to Columbus Clippers president George Sisler Jr. Cooper, Smith, Sisler, and American Association president Joe Ryan met that October to discuss plans for such a series. Under their proposal, the league champions of the American Association, International League, and Pacific Coast League would participate in a mulit-day round-robin tournament to determine a champion of the Triple-A classification. On October 28, representatives from all three leagues met to give final approval to the series.\nCardinal Stadium in Louisville, Kentucky, was selected as the site for the first Triple-A World Series because its Cardinals had set the all-time minor league attendance record that season. Through 65 games, total attendance was 1,052,438 people, for an average of over 16,000 per game. The series was to be televised on ESPN.\nThe 1983 Triple-A World Series was played from September 15–19. The total attendance for all four dates was 26,914 people, for an average of 6,728 per game. League officials believed something needed to be done to boost the series' popularity and attendance. They considered ensuring the home team's participation, playing the series before the Labor Day holiday, and moving to a new location. PCL president Bill Cutler proposed moving the series to Las Vegas for 1984. The IL supported this move, but the AA wanted to keep it in Louisville. Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, who felt uneasy about playing games in Las Vegas due to the presence of legalized gambling, cancelled the series in April 1984 after the three Triple-A presidents could not come to an agreement as to its location. There was not another postseason meeting of these minor leagues until 1988, when the International League and the American Association held the first Triple-A Classic, a best-of-seven series played in conjunction with the Triple-A Alliance. The Triple-A Classic continued as an annual event until league owners voted to end the Triple-A Alliance after 1991.\nTriple-A World Series in Las Vegas (1998–2000).\nOn July 9, 1997, Triple-A owners voted for a realignment plan that resulted in the American Association disbanding and its teams being absorbed by the International League and Pacific Coast League in 1998. A committee was established to explore the possibility of reviving the Triple-A World Series in a four-team IL-versus-PCL format involving either the champions and runners-up from each league or the incorporation of each league championship series into the series' semifinals. Plans were finalized before the start of the 1998 season. The IL and PCL champions would meet in a best-of-five series at Cashman Field in Las Vegas, home of the PCL's Las Vegas Stars. The agreement was joint venture between the two Triple-A leagues, Major League Baseball, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and was scheduled to run for three years, from 1998 to 2000. The site was chosen because of its reasonable travel costs and other offerings in the city. The series were to be televised on ESPN2.\nThe 1998 Triple-A World Series was played in four games from September 21–25. The average attendance was 3,368 people per game. Attendance at the 1999 series, played in five games from September 20–25, improved slightly to 4,002 per game. The average attendance at the four-game 2000 series, held from September 18–21, dropped to an all-time low of 2,311.\nBefore the 2000 Triple-A World Series, IL and PCL officials entered into negotiations with officials from Las Vegas about continuing the event beyond the original three-year deal. At the same time, they also explored other possible neutral sites for future games, including Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York, home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida. Another option was a home-and-home arrangement where games would be played at the home stadiums of each participant. An agreement to keep the event in Las Vegas was reached during the 2000 series, but the 2001 Triple-A World Series would be reduced to a best-of-three series held on a weekend rather than on weekdays. However, this decision was reversed months later when the leagues decided to suspend the series for 2001—citing poor attendance—and find a new format for 2002.\nUltimately, the Triple-A World Series was discontinued, and the International League and the Pacific Coast League returned to ending their seasons after the crowning of their own champions. No other postseason meetings between the leagues occurred until 2006 with the creation of the Bricktown Showdown, a single game to determine a champion of the Triple-A classification.\nResults.\n1983 Triple-A World Series.\nThe Denver Bears qualified for the 1983 Triple-A World Series by defeating the Louisville Redbirds, 4–0, to win the American Association championship. The Tidewater Tides beat the Richmond Braves, 3–1, to win the International League championship and advance to the series. The Portland Beavers won the Pacific Coast League championship and a spot in the series by sweeping the Albuquerque Dukes, 3–0. \nIn Game One, Tidewater defeated Denver, 7–1, behind the pitching performances of Tim Leary and Terry Leach, who limited the Bears to one run, and the offense of Rusty Tillman, who led the scoring with three runs batted in (RBIs). In Game Two, played the next day as the first part of a nine-inning double header, Portland took a three-run lead in the first inning and never relinquished, winning 11–8 over Tidewater.

New Orleans won a decisive Game 4 behind the bat of Lance Berkman, who hit three home runs and drove in six, in the 12–6 victory.

Charlotte tied the game, 5–5, in the bottom of the eighth, and walked-off with a 6–5 win after Eric Christopherson drove in Chad Mottola in the bottom of the ninth with a slow infield hit. In Game Two, Vancouver tied the series with a 5–4 win, with Terrence Long driving home Mike Neill with a triple in the fifth inning for the winning run. In Game Three, the Knights' Jon Garland struck out eight Canadians, allowing no earned runs, and Jeff Abbott and Jeff Liefer each homered off of Vancouver's Barry Zito, in a 4–2 victory. Vancouver answered with a 9–7 win in Game Four in which Joe Espada drove in Eric Martins for the key run in the eighth to send the series to the full five games. Vancouver won Game 5 and the series with a 16–2 rout over Charlotte. Mulder pitched a complete game, allowing two runs on seven hits, and Long and Roberto Vaz led the scoring with three RBIs apiece. Center fielder Terrence Long, who hit .429 with 9 hits and 10 RBIs, was selected as the series MVP.\n2000 Triple-A World Series.\nThe Indianapolis Indians gained a berth in the 2000 Triple-A World Series by winning the IL championship over the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, 3–2. The Memphis Redbirds won the PCL championship and advanced to the series by defeating the Salt Lake Buzz, 3–1. \nIn Game One, Lyle Mouton led the Indianapolis offense with four RBIs and a three-run home run in the seventh inning on the way to an 8–3 Indians win. Both teams scored in the first inning of Game Two, and the score remained knotted at 1–1 until the bottom of the eighth when Indianapolis's Santiago Pérez drove in Chris Jones for a 2–1 lead. Bob Scanlan, the IL saves leader, came in the ninth to close the game. Memphis lead-off hitter Albert Pujols drew a walk and eventually scored the tieing run on Keith McDonald's base hit. Tied 2–2 in the bottom of the ninth, the Indians' Creighton Gubanich hit a walk-off home run to give Indianapolis a 3–2 win and a 2–0 series lead. Memphis staved off elimination with an 11-4 Game Three victory behind the bat of Larry Sutton, who hit two home runs. In Game Four, Indianapolis' Horacio Estrada allowed two runs in the first inning and then pitched seven scoreless frames before Scanlan came in to close out the game with the Indians winning, 9–2, and taking the series, 3–1. Shortstop Santiago Pérez, who hit .462 with 2 home runs, 3 RBIs, and 4 runs, was selected as the series MVP.\nOverall.\nTwo of the four Triple-A World Series were won by International League teams, and two were won by Pacific Coast League teams. The Tidewater Tides (IL) won the initial 1983 series. The New Orleans Zephyrs (PCL) won in 1998, and the Vancouver Canadians (PCL) won in 1999. The Indianapolis Indians (IL) won the final series in 2000. IL and PCL teams tied in the all-time series with two wins apiece.

        "title": "United States of America Cricket Association",
        "text": "The United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), headquartered at Miami Beach, was the national governing body for all cricket in the United States, until it was replaced by USA Cricket in 2019. The board was formed in 1965.\nUSACA was an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council until June 23, 2017, when it was expelled following an ICC Board recommendation in April and a Dispute Resolution Committee hearing before the Honourable Michael Beloff QC.\nHistory.\nThe United States of America Cricket Association was started in 1965 with the help of John Marder and was admitted to the International Cricket Conference as an associate member that same year. This was the same group that had been so integral in keeping the United States out of international cricket when formed in 1909. Unfortunately, the administration of the USACA proved unable to administer the sport in the United States effectively. This led to suspensions from tournaments and ineligibilities and has rendered the USACA largely inactive.\nThe United States was able to participate in the ICC Trophy when the tournament started in 1979. The United States' team saw success in this tournament and continued to improve through 2005.\nIn July 2009, the USACA announced it was inviting proposals from prospective sponsors, broadcasters and game development partners to help launch the American Premier League, an Indian Premier League style Twenty20 league tournament. No American Premier League matches were played in 2010, and in April 2011 no further matches have been announced. The board announced in December 2010 that it had signed a $10 million deal with New Zealand Cricket and several strategic investors are stakeholders, creating a new body called Cricket Holdings America to manage all commercial rights for cricket in USA, including Twenty20 rights, in perpetuity\nIn January 2011, USACA was awarded the top prize in the Junior Participation Initiative category by the ICC America's region in the 2010 Pepsi ICC Development Programme Awards for the United States Youth Cricket Association's Schools Program.\nThe USACA supported the American Twenty20 Championship, an American Twenty20 cricket tournament aimed at grooming American cricket players for international events and to spread interest in American Cricket. Its first season was only a 3-day affair, played in New Jersey and won by the Atlantic Division. The tournament was supported by the United States of America Cricket Association, the national federation of cricket in the US.\nAfter not being held in 2012 and 2013, the USACA announced that the tournament would be again played in 2014.\nHowever, in May 2014, the city of Indianapolis, Indiana terminated its agreement to host the relaunch of the USA Cricket Association National Championships, which were due to be held from August in the brand new $6 million Indianapolis World Sports Park facility. Indianapolis Parks and Recreation director John W. Williams sent a letter to USACA notifying them of the termination and a city official confirmed that the decision includes not just the 2014 championship but the entire three-year agreement which had been signed in September 2013 under former USACA chief executive Darren Beazley. In June 2014, USA Cricket Association announced that that year's USACA National Championship would be moved to Lauderhill, Florida following the termination of the three-year hosting agreement by the city of Indianapolis.\nMembership.\nThe USACA had 51 state association members across seven zones (Atlantic, New York, South East, North East, Central West, Central East, West Coast) in the United States.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe USACA organized the following tournaments:\nControversies and expulsion by ICC.\nThe 2005 ICC Trophy represented a chance for the US to re-establish themselves on the world stage and qualify for the 2007 World Cup. A poor showing saw them finish at the bottom of their group, with four losses and a match abandoned due to rain from their five group fixtures. This failure robbed the USA of the prize of full One Day International status on offer to the World Cup qualifiers. This failure was compounded on 9 August 2005 when the ICC expelled the US from the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup.\nThe United States of America Cricket Association was again suspended from the ICC and the team was pulled from the World Cricket League. The suspension was due to an internal dispute over a constitution for the USACA. The dispute was resolved in early 2008, and the suspension was lifted on 1 April of that year.\nOn 28 January 2015, the ICC sent a letter to USACA outlining several infractions and asking for a re-payment of a 200K loan it made to USACA. The letter was a notice of suspension to be realized at the ICC meeting held in April 2015. At the end of the ICC meeting \"It was decided that there was a significant amount of further work that needed to be carried out in order to complete a full and proper assessment. In support of this, a Task Force headed by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson will travel to the USA to meet relevant stakeholders in USA cricket in order to prepare a comprehensive report for further consideration by the ICC Executive Committee and ICC Board at its next meeting.\"\nSince September 2014 the ICC has frozen USACA's funding, the USACA did not have the money to attend the 2015 Pepsi ICC World T20 Qualifier Tournament in May 2015. Ironically, the tournament was being held in Indiana USA.\nIn June 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA when it failed to adopt a constitution that met a number of requirements to improve governance and transparency.\nStadiums.\nThe only ICC-certified cricket stadium in North America is Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida. The Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Los Angeles is an established cricket ground with four fields. The city of Indianapolis, Indiana built what it called a \"world-class\" cricket field as part of the $6 million Indianapolis World Sports Park. The facility opened in 2014."

        "title": "This Week in Baseball",
        "text": "This Week in Baseball (abbreviated as \"TWiB\", pronounced phonetically) is an American television series that focuses on Major League Baseball highlights. Broadcast weekly during baseball season (and in its second incarnation, prior to marquee MLB games and during rain-delays) the program featured highlights of recent games, interviews with players, and other regular features. The popularity of the program, best known for its original host, New York Yankees play-by-play commentator Mel Allen, also helped influence the creation of other sports highlight programs, including ESPN's \"SportsCenter\".\nHistory.\nWhen Commissioner Bowie Kuhn first took office in 1969, the only weekly showcase of Major League Baseball was its Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" on NBC. On the other hand, the National Football League had produced its own syndicated highlight programs like \"This Week in Pro Football\" through its in-house unit NFL Films. In response to its competition, \"This Week in Baseball\" premiered in first-run syndication in 1977. The show was originally hosted by long-time New York Yankees announcer Mel Allen.\nThe program was typically picked up by stations that also had television rights to major league franchises like WTBS in Atlanta, KTTV in Los Angeles, and WGN in Chicago. \"TWIB\" would also air on owned-and-operated NBC stations as a prelude of sorts to NBC's \"Game of the Week\" telecasts.\nAccording to Curt Smith's biography on Mel Allen entitled \"The Voice: Mel Allen's Untold Story\", when NBC lost the rights to the \"Game of the Week\" to CBS (who, unlike NBC, didn't broadcast regular-season games for all 26 weeks of the season) after the 1989 season, \"TWIB\", \"sans\" a strong anchor, proceeded to either lose markets or move to weaker, (often independent) stations. Even more so, \"TWIB\" was now (under the CBS umbrella) averaging a 1-2 rating and, in several places, airing at midnight (as opposed to, for example, WNBC New York at 1:30 p.m.; in this case, however, \"TWIB\" moved to WWOR, which had the rights to the New York Mets at the time, and aired on Sunday afternoons as the Mets' lead-in for their game telecasts).\nEnd of the Mel Allen era.\nIn 1996, Mel Allen died. Warner Fusselle, who had previously contributed the \"TWIB Notes\" and \"TWIB Ticker\" segments as well as substituting for Allen frequently in later years, and filled in for Allen when needed ultimately took over for the remainder of the season. In 1997, the recently retired Ozzie Smith became the new permanent host with Fusselle serving as the show's announcer and main contributor. \"TWIB\" had pretty much moved into being more of cable-syndicated show as in Detroit for instance, it was shown on PASS (Pro-Am Sports System). By this point, however, \"TWIB\" appeared to have run its course and the 1998 season proved to be the last for the original series.\nFrom syndication to Fox.\nIn 2000, Fox Sports decided to cancel its young-viewer-centered baseball series \"In the Zone\" (Fox's answer to \"NBA Inside Stuff\") in favor of reviving \"This Week in Baseball\". While the show was much more feature-driven than it had been before and was still targeted at the younger audience, the show retained some of the older features, such as plays of the week and the same open and closing themes.\nCam Brainard hosted and narrated the new series. For much of the show's run, a claymation version of Mel Allen introduced and closed the show.\nAlthough all other children's programs were cancelled by Fox on December 28, 2008, \"TWIB\" was retained at least for the 2009 season, airing for the first time in high definition. It also aired on the MLB Network.\nBy the 2011 season, \"TWIB\"s ratings declined as the result of such shows as ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\" and \"SportsCenter\", which showed baseball highlights daily. The rise of baseball highlights on the internet and the MLB Network also sealed \"TWIB\"s fate. In 2012, Fox cancelled \"TWIB\" and replaced it with a new baseball-oriented show, \"MLB Player Poll\".\nFormat.\nThe show also aired on regional sports networks around the country, on Rogers Sportsnet in Canada, and was also often played as part of the pre-game entertainment on the TV screens of major league stadiums. From 2004-2005, segments of the show were hosted by U.S. fast-pitch softball sensation Jennie Finch.\nIn 2007, \"TWIB\" was slated for 26 episodes running from April to the end of September, focusing on stories of various clubs and different baseball themes each week. The segment \"Front Row Fan\" features celebrities reminiscing about their favorite baseball memories. Guests have included Tom Hanks, Bernie Mac, Alyssa Milano and Kevin James. There is also a play of the week section and TWIBIA, in which a trivia question is asked before the commercial break.\nHighlights of the past week's action are used less frequently, except for a closing highlight reel set to popular songs. The highlight reel is named \"How 'Bout That?\", in reference to Mel Allen's well-known catchphrase. Video is gathered from each of the 30 Clubs' Stadium Loggers, who compile highlights of each game and send them to MLB Productions in Secaucus, NJ.\nThe program also used educational segments to help it qualify for E/I status in the United States.\nEpisode status.\nReruns of the 1977–1998 Mel Allen version of the show was aired on ESPN Classic in the 2000s and Fox Sports 1 in 2020 when the 2020 Major League Baseball season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSome episodes of the 1977–1998 version of the show are available for streaming online on Pluto TV and Prime Video in the United States.\nMusic.\nThe opening theme music to \"TWIB\" is \"Jet Set\", composed by Mike Vickers, a former member of the original Manfred Mann band. \"Jet Set\" was first used as the theme for the original 1974–75 version of the game show \"Jackpot.\" When Fox brought \"TWIB\" back, a slightly revamped version of \"Jet Set\" was written.\nThe closing theme to the show is \"Gathering Crowds\", composed by John Scott. It is typically played over a montage of baseball's greatest moments, building to a crescendo with a punctuated three-note chord as the MLB logo slides into view. The piece has also been utilized to similar effect for montages and credits at the end of, for example, local TV newscasts."

He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, earning consensus All-American honors in 1988.\nEarly years.\nWalsh attended Cretin-Derham Hall High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota. As a senior in 1984, he passed for over 2,000 yards and 25 touchdowns, receiving USA Today prep Academic All-America and the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro football player of the year honors. He also played basketball.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Miami. After redshirting a season, he was the backup quarterback to Heisman Trophy winner Vinny Testaverde in 1986.\nIn 1987, he was named the starter at quarterback over Craig Erickson. He led the Miami Hurricanes to the 1987 national championship (the second ever for the school), while registering 2,249 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and 7 interceptions.\nIn 1988, Walsh finished 4th in the Heisman Trophy balloting and runner-up to the Davey O'Brien Award, after posting 3,115 passing yards, 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Against the No. 8 ranked University of Arkansas, he set a school record with 33 completions. He suffered his only defeat as a starter against the University of Notre Dame, 30–31, after passing for 424 yards (second in school history) and losing a shot at the National Championship. He left school in April 1989 and declared for the NFL supplemental draft, skipping his final year of eligibility.\nA pro-sized passer, he posted a record of 23–1 in his two seasons. He finished his college career with 410 completions out of 690 attempts, 5369 passing yards, 48 touchdowns, 19 interceptions, was sacked only 14 times and had at least one touchdown pass in 18 of his last 20 games. He was tied with Testaverde for the school record for career touchdown passes (48), before being surpassed by Ken Dorsey in 2002.\nIn 1999, he was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. In 2009, he was inducted into the University of Miami Football Ring of Honor.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nThe Dallas Cowboys surprised observers by selecting Walsh with the second overall pick in the NFL supplemental draft, even though they had already selected Troy Aikman number one overall in the 1989 NFL draft and had to surrender by rule an equivalent pick in the 1990 NFL draft, which would turn out to be the number one overall selection. Walsh started five games as a rookie, while Aikman recovered from a broken finger. He recorded Dallas' only win of the season, a 13–3 victory over the rival Washington Redskins. Against the Kansas City Chiefs, he completed 23 out of 36 passes for 294 yards and one touchdown. He recorded 1,371 yards and 5 touchdowns, while working with an inexperienced supporting cast.\nHead coach Jimmy Johnson who was also his coach in Miami, reportedly favored him as the starter, but Walsh was never able to move out of Aikman's shadow and was traded to the New Orleans Saints three games into the 1990 season, in exchange for a first, second and third round draft picks. With the third draft choice the Cowboys selected (#70-Erik Williams), the other two picks (#14-Leonard Russell and #52-Patrick Rowe) were traded to the New England Patriots as a package to move up to the number one overall draft choice to select Russell Maryland.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn September 25, 1990, the Dallas Cowboys traded Walsh to the New Orleans Saints for the Saint's first and third round picks in the 1991 NFL draft and a second round pick (that could become a first round pick based on performance) in the 1992 NFL draft.\nThe Saints acquired Walsh, because quarterback Bobby Hebert was in the middle of a contract hold out that lasted all season long, and John Fourcade got off to a poor start. He generated high expectations after winning his first game against the Cleveland Browns, while throwing 3 touchdown passes. Walsh passed for 1,970 yards and 12 touchdowns, leading the franchise to its second ever playoff appearance, after finishing the season 8–8 and knocking the Cowboys out of the final playoff spot.\nThe next year, he lost his job after Hebert returned to the team, and would start only 8 games in the following three seasons, while bouncing between the backup and third-string roles behind Hebert (1991-1992) and Wade Wilson (1993). He was waived on April 24, 1994.\nChicago Bears.\nOn April 26, 1994, the Chicago Bears signed Walsh as an unrestricted free agent, reuniting with former Cowboys and Hurricanes defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt. After the third game of the season he replaced an injured Erik Kramer, posting an 8–3 regular season record as a starter and a 35–18 win against the Minnesota Vikings in the wild card round of the playoffs. The next year, Kramer regained the starting job and Walsh would only play in one game.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nOn April 10, 1996, he was signed by the St. Louis Rams as a free agent. He started the first three games before being passed on the depth chart by rookie Tony Banks. He completed 33 of 77 passes for 344 yards and had 5 interceptions.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn April 16, 1997, he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to backup Trent Dilfer. He appeared in 17 games during 2 seasons.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn August 11, 1999, he was signed by the Indianapolis Colts to back up second-year pro Peyton Manning. He was released on February 2, 2000. He finished his career with 713 completions in 1,317 attempts (54.1%), 7,875 passing yards, 40 touchdowns and 50 interceptions, for a passer rating of 66.4.\nCoaching career.\nIn December 2008, Walsh accepted the head football coaching job at Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Florida. After a 4–6 record in his first season, Cardinal Newman finished 7–4 in 2010 and earned its first playoff appearance since 2005. Walsh coached the team to 10-2 records in 2011 and 2012, before losing in the opening round of the 3A playoffs. In 2013, Walsh led Newman to their First District Championship in 10 years and the Regional Final. It was the school's fifth straight playoff appearance. In April 2015, Walsh accepted the Director of Football position at IMG Academy, replacing Chris Weinke. He joined the Toronto Argonauts' coaching staff in 2017 as a senior assistant.\nIn February 2018, Walsh became the quarterbacks coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\nIn February 2020, Walsh became the quarterbacks coach for the Ottawa Redblacks.\nIn December 2021, Walsh was named the head football coach at his high school alma mater, Cretin-Derham Hall in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2001, Walsh entered into the Mortgage Banking business. He returned to football in 2009, when he was named the head coach for Cardinal Newman High School.\nWalsh is the uncle of fellow Cretin-Derham Hall High School alumnus and National Hockey League defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who currently plays for the Nashville Predators."

        "text": "The County Cricket Ground, known for sponsorship reasons as The 1st Central County Ground, is a cricket venue in Hove, in the city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England. The County Ground is the home of Sussex County Cricket Club, where most Sussex home matches since 1872 have been played, although many other grounds in Sussex have been used. Sussex CCC continue to play some of their games away from The County Ground, at either Arundel Castle or Horsham. It is one of the few county grounds to have deckchairs for spectators, in the Sussex CCC colours of blue and white, and was the first cricket ground to install permanent floodlights, for day/night cricket matches and the second ground (after Edgbaston) to host a day/night match in England, in 1997.\nCricket history.\nPrior to 1872, Sussex County Cricket Club played their home matches at Royal Brunswick Ground. The land for the County Ground was a barley field until it was bought in 1871. The turf from the Royal Brunswick Ground was then brought to the County Ground, which became the home of Sussex CCC in 1872, and continues to be so.\nIn 1872, George \"Farmer\" Bennett became the first batsman in first-class cricket to be given out handled ball during a match between Kent and Sussex at the County Ground. In 1873, Sussex bowled Worcestershire out for 19 at Hove. In 1884–85, the public raised £4,400 towards the purchase of the ground, with the Earl of Sheffield contributing an additional £600. In the 20th century, the ground was used for some other cricket matches, such as a charity match in 1927 between the \"Jockeys\" and the \"Racing Press\", in aid of the Royal Sussex County Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital, and an annual match between local commercial travellers and grocers, nicknamed \"Travellers v. Grocers\"; in 1925, the match was won by the Travellers by 1 run.\nThe ground has hosted one men's One Day International; the match was part of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and was a Group A match between South Africa and India, which South Africa won by 4 wickets. The County Ground has also hosted 2 Test matches in The Women's Ashes in 1987 and 2005; in addition, the ground hosted two One Day Internationals in the 2013 Women's Ashes, As of 2017, 5 Women's ODIs and 4 Women's T20Is have been hosted at the ground.\nIn 2003, The County Ground was the venue where Sussex won their first County Championship title. In that match, Sussex batsman Murray Goodwin also scored 335*, which was then highest score by a Sussex player in first-class cricket. The ground also saw Sussex win their third Championship title in 2007.\nNon-cricket history.\nDuring the 1890s, the County Ground was also used as a football ground for teams from the Brighton Area, including Brighton United of the Southern League (until they went bust in 1900), and Brighton Athletic of the East Sussex League. The ground was also the venue for the Sussex lawn tennis championship meetings in 1893 and 1899, and in 1948, the County Ground also hosted a rugby union match between Brighton and a Midland Bank team.\nMany concerts have been held at the County Ground. Elton John has played at the ground in 2006, 2011 and 2019, the ground has also hosted Madness, Lionel Richie (with Shane Filan of Westlife as support act), Little Mix, Olly Murs, Cliff Richard and Rod Stewart. As part of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay, the ground hosted an official Olympic torch event.\nFor many years, the County Ground has hosted a popular fireworks display within the South East, for Guy Fawkes Night. In 2019, the annual fireworks night sold out with over 7,500 attendees."

        "title": "Jason Smith (rugby league)",
        "text": "Jason Smith (born 14 March 1972) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative or lock forward, he played club football in Australia for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs (with whom he won the 1995 Premiership), Parramatta Eels, Canberra Raiders and the North Queensland Cowboys, and in England for Hull F.C. At his peak he was regarded as one of the game's greatest players.\nBackground.\nBorn in Brisbane, Jason Smith is the younger brother of Darren Smith and was a Brisbane Souths five-eighth/lock.\nProfessional playing career.\n1990s.\nSmith signed with Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs as an 18-year-old in 1990. The following year Smith captained the club's President's Cup side to a grand final win over Parramatta. Mobile yet strong, he displayed his talent as a ball-player in Canterbury's back row or at five-eighth and impressed as a resolute defender. His début for Queensland in the 1994 State of Origin series ended when he was concussed after a sickening clash of heads with rival forward Ian Roberts. Smith recovered to play in Canterbury's losing grand final side and was rewarded for his season's efforts with selection in Australia's 28-man Kangaroo squad. His form on the 1994 Kangaroo tour was excellent and although he was the outstanding player in wins over Warrington and Bradford Northern in the week leading up to Third Test selection, he could not break into Australia's Test team. 1995 proved to be a turning point in Smith's career. After having originally signed with the Bulldogs to join Super League, Smith and three teammates (Dean Pay, Jarrod McCracken and Jim Dymock) turned their backs on their club and signed with the ARL. This move consequently ensured Smith a place in Queensland's State of Origin team, with whom he was named man-of-the-match in the second game of the 1995 series. He also went on to play in all three Tests against New Zealand. After gaining a release from his Super League contract via the courts, Smith played in the Bulldogs' grand final victory over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles before coming off the interchange bench in Australia's 16–8 win in the 1995 World Cup final.\nJoining Parramatta Eels along with his defecting teammates in 1996 following year in order to remain with the ARL competition, Smith's representative career continued for Queensland and Australia (against Papua New Guinea) but his 1997 season was ruined by injury. At Parramatta, Smith's commitment never wavered despite a succession of injuries. In three successive preliminary finals (1998-00), the Eels faltered at the last hurdle to making the grand final and too often the young club's fortunes rested on his shoulders. In 1998, with rugby league re-united, Smith played in the final two Tests of the Trans-Tasman series, alongside his brother Darren, and was chosen as lock in the first international the following year, Australia's 20–14 win over New Zealand. In Game III of the 1999 State of Origin series, Smith was cleared of a controversial high tackle on opposing forward Mark Carroll that left the Blues' prop heavily concussed. (Later it was revealed that Carroll's own hand, which he raised in a reflex action to protect himself in Smith's ball and all tackle, had struck him and done most of the damage). Smith's 1999 NRL season concluded with three Test appearances in Australia's victorious 1999 Tri-nations series victory over New Zealand and Great Britain in Auckland.\n2000s.\n2000 saw Smith make his final appearance for Australia, in the 52-0 thrashing of the Kiwis in the ANZAC Test. That year he was also awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Declining to take on the Parramatta captaincy in his final year with the club, his career appeared to be winding down after injuries and suspension saw him miss much of the second half of the season. Smith left the Eels at the end of the year to play for Hull F.C. in the Super League, captaining the side from 2002 to 2004.\n2005 saw Smith back in Australia playing with the Canberra Raiders. He also turned down a request to make a State of Origin comeback for Queensland. 2007 saw a move North for Smith to the North Queensland Cowboys, becoming the oldest player to compete in the 2007 NRL season at age 35 years and 186 days. On 6 June, midway through the season, he announced that would retire at the end of the season. His final game was on 15 September in the Cowboys' semi-final victory over the New Zealand Warriors. A leg injury saw him sit out the preliminary final loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nPost-playing.\nBrisbane newspaper \"The Courier-Mail\" confirmed on 31 August 2007 that Smith was appointed to the position of assistant coach of the Souths Logan Magpies in the 2008 Queensland Cup. This put him in direct opposition with brother Darren, who was head coach of rival side, Eastern Suburbs Tigers. Smith played in the 2011 Legends of Origin charity match organised by former player Mark Geyer to raise money for Queensland flood victims. He also moved to Toowoomba where he bought the iconic Mill Street Tavern and played for Toowoomba Brothers in the Toowoomba Rugby League competition in 2011. In November 2016, the tavern was destroyed by a fire which authorities described as “suspicious”.\nIn January 2014, Smith was charged with trafficking cocaine in south-east Queensland. After pleading guilty to eight charges of possessing more than two grams of cocaine, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment but released immediately on parole."

        "title": "Attack (fencing)",
        "text": "In fencing, an attack is \"The attack is the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent’s target, preceding the launching of the lunge or flèche\". In order for an attack to be awarded successfully, the fencer must accelerate their hand towards the target. If the fencer does not accelerate the hand, this is a preparation.\nTactical significance.\nThe purpose of an attack is either to make a hit or to provoke a defensive reaction. In order to do either, the attacker must create a threat. A fencer launches an attack by extending his weapon-carrying arm in such a way that the point threatens the opponent's target area (except in sabre where the blade need not be threatening the target when the arm is extended, the right of way can still be given). The attack may be delivered with the aid of appropriate fencing footwork.\nIn weapons governed by priority rules (foil and sabre), the attacker gets priority (as a reward for his initiative). He retains this priority until his attack either misses, falls short, is withdrawn, or is parried. In foil, the attack must threaten the opponent's target with the point, while in sabre, an attack may threaten with either the point or the edge of the weapon.\nClassification.\nAny attack may be \"prepared\" by footwork (e.g. a step forward to bring you within range) or by bladework (e.g. a beat intended to upset your opponent's control over his weapon, draw a convenient reaction or confuse him into inactivity). Most elite fencers do not attempt to simply overpower their opponents with speed, but rely on the guile of the second intention to manipulate their opponents, thereby controlling them.\nA direct thrust is sometimes known as \"foining\". (Middle English foinen, from foin, a thrust, from Old French foine, pitchfork, from Latin fuscina, three-pronged fish spear.)"

        "title": "Cartwheel (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A cartwheel is a sideways rotary movement of the body. It is performed by bringing the hands to the floor one at a time while the body inverts. The legs travel over the body trunk while one or both hands are on the floor, and then the feet return to the floor one at a time, ending with the athlete standing upright. It is called a \"cartwheel\" because the performer's arms and legs move in a fashion similar to the spokes of a turning (cart) wheel. \nCartwheels are commonly performed in gymnastics in the floor exercise and on the balance beam. On the floor, a gymnast may precede a cartwheel with other movements, as in a chasse cartwheel, which begins with side-step \"gallops\". It is a required skill in the USA Gymnastics Level 4 compulsory beam routine. Besides gymnastics, cartwheels are performed in certain dances, cheer, and in the martial art of capoeira. In classical Indian Karana dance, it is called \"talavilasitam\".\nHistory.\nCartwheels date back to antiquity and were used for play by the ancient Greeks and Romans. An early documented case of cartwheels occurred in Dusseldorf after the Battle of Worringen in which Adolf VIII, Count of Berg, defeated the Archbishop of Cologne in 1288. As a result of the victory, Düsseldorf received city rights and children celebrated in the streets by doing cartwheels.\nThe first modern, performance use of cartwheels was in 1925 by Matthew Douglass, the leader of a popular circus based in Gosforth, Newcastle, who used the trick when dodging flaming spears.\nTechnique.\nTo perform a cartwheel, one moves sideways in a straight line, keeping the back straight, butt and core tight and head in; places the hand of the same side on the ground, followed by the other hand; kicks the legs over the body and brings them down as the hands and body come up to a standing position.\nA classic cartwheel performed with proper gymnastics form always starts with a forward lunge: the lead leg (stronger leg) in front and the weaker leg in the back. During the lunge, the gymnast has their arms high in the air and straight, with hips square and belly button, facing forward. The gymnast then pushes off the front leg and places their hands side by side on the ground in front of them. As they do this, they kick her legs up and over their torso and head as their body becomes inverted. During the rotation, the legs stay apart in a large, wide straddle (as far apart as the gymnast can get them). The legs are straight, and the toes and feet are pointed. In United States competitions, the legs must reach at least 90 degrees of motion in a competition in order for the gymnast to receive the maximum amount of points. Finally, the gymnast sets their first foot on the ground, followed by the second foot, landing in a lunge with the weaker leg in front and the lead leg in back. The gymnast lands facing the opposite direction from the one they started in, hands and arms straight and high, then salutes.\nA cartwheel with legs bent rather than outstretched when the body is inverted can be a useful interim training technique for gymnastic pupils attempting to learn the full cartwheel, as the smaller body area is easier to control."

        "title": "Carrying (basketball)",
        "text": "Definition.\nCarrying Violation (NBA).\nThe NBA outlines exactly what constitutes a carrying violation during a game, but over the years, NBA fans have seen different installments of this rule, and the frequency of this violation being called.\nBackground.\nHistory of the Rule: James Naismith, creator and founder of the game we know of today as basketball, actually indirectly created the original carrying violation. Naismith implemented twelve foundational rules of basketball with one being, \" A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to me made for man who catches the ball when running, if he tries to stop.\" When basketball was first being played, dribbling the ball was not a very popular method of moving the ball around the court, instead the players would preform subsequent short passes between teammates, to advance the ball. For the next fifty years, the carrying violation in the NBA didn't see much discussion, as fans saw the rule being enforced at all times when a player puts their hand under the ball, and continues another dribble.\nThe 80s and 90s: It wasn't until the early 80s and throughout the 90s where the carrying rule was again put under the spotlight. Argued as the greatest player to ever play in the NBA, Michael Jordan, many fans started to notice that Jordan would often put his hand under the ball and continue dribbling, otherwise known as carrying, without consequence from the officiating team. Fans speculated even further and began assuming that due to the star-power and celebrity status Jordan held, he was the benefactor of \"superstar calls\". Superstar calls are calls only the biggest name players get, many believing that this is the NBA's way of preserving their status among pop culture. Superstar calls come in all forms, whether its players being allowed to carry the ball more frequently without repercussion, or receiving more fouls called in favor of the superstar player. While the carrying violation problem wasn't necessarily a big issue for fans, as we move towards the turn of the 2020s, the NBA knew they had to do something. \nToday's NBA.\nCurrent State of the NBA and Carrying: During the 2022 NBA season, the NBA issued a team-wide memo stating that the league will be cracking down on the carrying violation, thus calling the violation more often throughout games. The night before the memo was sent out, a game between the Miami Heat and the Golden State featured a game with no less than four carrying violations being called. This started a new era in the NBA in terms of star players being no longer able to get away with more contact towards other players, or getting away with carrying. But as we're almost three years removed, has the league actually made a change in the way they call carrying? As of November of the current 2023-2024 NBA season, 57 carries were called during that month alone, only ten less violations that were called in the entirety of the 2022-2023 NBA season. Just by watching games of the current season, it's quite obvious the NBA has taken the new rules seriously and are making the effort to change the league for the better. \nCarrying is a rule violation in the game of basketball. It occurs when a player places a hand underneath the basketball while dribbling, pauses the dribble, and then resumes the dribble."

        "title": "Traveling (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, traveling is a violation that occurs when a player takes too many steps without dribbling the ball. Traveling is also called, predominantly in a streetball game, \"walking\" or \"steps\". If the pivot foot is lifted, the player must make an attempt at a pass or a basket, before it is placed back onto the floor.\nIn the NBA and FIBA, when a player has taken more than two steps without the ball being dribbled, a traveling violation is called. The NCAA and NFHS do not allow two steps. A travel can also be called via carrying or an unestablished pivot foot. If the pivot foot of a player changes or moves, it is considered traveling.\nIn basketball.\nDefinitions.\nNCAA.\nRule 9, Section 5. Traveling\nArt. 1. A player shall not travel with the ball.\nArt. 2. Traveling occurs when a player holding the ball moves a foot or both feet in any direction in excess of prescribed limits described in this section.\nArt. 3. A player who catches the ball with both feet on the playing court may pivot, using either foot. When one foot is lifted, the other is the pivot foot.\nArt. 4. A player who catches the ball while moving or ends a dribble may stop and establish a pivot foot as follows: \nArt. 5. After coming to a stop and establishing the pivot foot:\nArt. 6. After coming to a stop when neither foot can be the pivot foot:\nArt. 7. It is traveling when a player falls to the playing court while holding the ball without maintaining a pivot foot.\nNFHS.\nThe National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) traveling rule is almost identical to the NCAA rule, with an additional article clarifying restrictions regarding a player holding the ball while on the floor.\nNBA.\nRule 10, Section XIII—Traveling\na. A player who receives the ball while standing still may pivot, using either foot as the pivot foot.\nb. A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball. A player who receives the ball while he is progressing must release the ball to start his dribble before his second step.\nThe first step occurs when a foot, or both feet, touch the floor after gaining control of the ball.\nThe second step occurs after the first step when the other foot touches the floor, or both feet touch the floor simultaneously.\nA player who comes to a stop on step one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he jumps with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor.\nA player who lands with one foot first may only pivot using that foot.\nA progressing player who jumps off one foot on the first step may land with both feet simultaneously for the second step. In this situation, the player may not pivot with either foot and if one or both feet leave the floor the ball must be released before either returns to the floor.\nc. In starting a dribble after (1) receiving the ball while standing still, or (2) coming to a legal stop, the ball must be out of the player’s hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor.\nd. If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor. If he drops the ball while in the air, he may not be the first to touch the ball.\ne. A player who falls to the floor while holding the ball, or while coming to a stop, may not gain an advantage by sliding.\nf. A player who attempts a field goal may not be the first to touch the ball if it fails to touch the backboard, basket ring or another player.\ng. A player is not allowed to be the first to touch his own pass unless the ball touches his backboard, basket ring or another player.\nh. Upon ending his dribble or gaining control of the ball, a player may not touch the floor consecutively with the same foot (hop).\nAccording to some observers, enforcement of the rule as written is not necessarily rigorous in the NBA, and traveling violations are often overlooked.\nFIBA.\nArticle 25 of the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2018:\n25.1 Definition\n25.1.1. Traveling is the illegal movement of one foot or both feet beyond the limits outlined in this article, in any direction, while holding a live ball on the playing court.\n25.1.2. A pivot is the legal movement in which a player who is holding a live ball on the playing court steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, while the other foot, called the pivot foot, is kept at its point of contact with the floor.\n25.2. Rule\n25.2.1. Establishing a pivot foot by a player who catches a live ball on the playing court:\n25.2.2. A player falling, lying or sitting on the floor:\nPenalty.\nThe ball becomes dead and a throw-in is awarded to the opposing team out of bounds nearest the point where the violation took place under NCAA and NFHS rules. Under NBA rules, the ball is awarded to the opposing team at the nearest spot but no closer to the baseline than the free throw line extended.\nHistorical Rule Changes.\nThe interpretation and enforcement of this rule have seen various changes over the years, reflecting the evolution of the game and the establishment of rules by different leagues. Here's a brief overview of the progression of traveling rules:\nEarly Basketball: Initially, there were no concrete rules governing player movement. Referees had to rely on their judgment, without specific guidelines to determine a traveling violation.\nDribbling's Introduction: Contrary to what many might think, dribbling wasn't an original component of basketball. It was introduced by the Yale University basketball team in 1897, and over time, became a fundamental part of the sport.\nNBA and FIBA Standards: Both the NBA and FIBA define traveling as taking more than two steps without dribbling. However, the NCAA and NFHS have stricter interpretations, not permitting the two-step motion without a dribble.\nGather Step Addition: In an effort to bring more clarity and consistency, FIBA, in 2018, incorporated the \"gather step\" into its traveling rules. This change made FIBA's interpretation more aligned with that of the NBA.\nPivot Foot: Another dimension of the traveling rule is the pivot foot. If a player shifts or moves their established pivot foot, it's deemed a traveling violation.\nSlip Foot: If a player stops with the ball but they are in an unstable position and have to take a small step to regain balance, depending on how far the 'slip' is, it will be deemed as a travel violation.\nThese adaptations over the years have aimed to bring uniformity to the traveling rules across various leagues and organizations. Such standardization has made the game more comprehensible and consistent for its players, coaches, and enthusiasts.\nIn netball.\nNetball rules do not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in possession of the ball, so players can take steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance on the other foot if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called \"traveling\" (or \"steps\") as in basketball. \nIFNA Rule 14.3 states:\nA free pass is awarded to the opposing team where the infringement occurred.\nIn korfball.\nIn korfball, either foot can be used as pivot, no matter which foot touches the ground first. This means that in practice, one can take steps, e.g. landing on the right foot, putting down the left and displacing the right. The left foot is the pivot in this case. The left foot can then be lifted, but may not be repositioned."

        "title": "Women's cricket",
        "text": "Women's cricket is the team sport of cricket when played by women. Its \nrules are almost identical to those in the game played by men, the main change being the use of a smaller ball. Women's cricket is beginning to be played at professional level in 11 of the 12 full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is played worldwide, especially in Commonwealth nations.\nThe first recorded cricket match between women was held in England on 26 July 1745. The game continued to be played socially by women until clubs for women were formed in the late 1800s. In 1926, the creation of the Women's Cricket Association (WCA) in England began the process of formalising the game and organising international matches. Like many women's sports, the further development of women's cricket was hampered by sexism and a lack of structural support.\nAlthough women have historically played Test cricket and first class cricket, the focus of the women's game in the last 50 years has been mostly on limited overs cricket. The introduction of Twenty20 cricket (T20) in 2003 created more opportunities for the growth of the women's game. As well as competing against each other in tours, national teams also compete in several tournaments, including the Cricket World Cup and the T20 World Cup. Women's cricket has also been part of several multi-sport events.\nIn domestic cricket, many countries have T20 cricket and List A cricket competitions that are run either alongside or separately from men's competitions. Grass roots cricket is growing, especially in England and Australia, although many barriers still remain. Cricket boards often organise competitions that use new formats that are intended to appeal to women. Cricket for women with disabilities is also growing, especially in South Asia.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded cricket match between women was reported in \"The Reading Mercury\" on 26 July 1745; the match was contested \"between eleven maids of Bramley and eleven maids of Hambledon, all dressed in white\". The first known women's cricket club the White Heather Club was formed in 1887 in Yorkshire. Three years later, a team known as the Original English Lady Cricketers toured England, reportedly making substantial profits before the manager absconded with the money.\nIn Australia, a women's cricket league was set up in 1894 and Port Elizabeth, South Africa, had a women's cricket team named the Pioneers Cricket Club. In Canada, a women's cricket team in Victoria played at Beacon Hill Park.\nIn India, cricket teams for women existed as early as the 1920s. Delhi Ladies Cricket Club beat the men's Marylebone Cricket Club in a half-day game on their 1926–27 tour of India, one of the only matches they lost on the tour. Because it was a women's team, the game is omitted from records of the tour. During the 1950s and 1960s, cricket was strongest in the urban centres Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. The most-notable club in this period is Albees in Mumbai; many Albees players were female family members of prominent men's Test cricketers.\nIn 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) was formed to co-ordinate women's cricket around the world, taking over from the English Women's Cricket Association (WCA), which had been working in a \"de facto\" role since its creation 32 years earlier. In 2005, the IWCC was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form a unified body to manage and develop cricket.\nLaws and gameplay.\nLanguage.\nMuch of the language of cricket is heavily gendered; terms such as maiden over, nightwatchman, and third man are not officially sanctioned but remain in colloquial use. In 2021, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) amended the rulebook, the \"Laws of Cricket\", to replace the term \"batsman\" with the term \"batter\" to better reflect the modern game. There was some derision in parts of the cricketing and wider press but others responded that the term \"batter\" had been in widespread use through much of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nRule modifications.\nIn \"The Laws of Cricket\", the only explicit difference between men's and women's cricket is the ball size. According to \"The Laws of Cricket\":\nFor comparison, the ball in the men's game should weigh between , and be between in circumference. Many tournaments and forms of cricket, however, have additional differences in rules between women's and men's games.\nTest cricket.\nIn the 2023 ICC rules, the main differences from the men's games are:\nOne Day International cricket.\nBy the June 2023 ICC rules for One Day International (ODI) matches, the main differences are:\nTwenty20 International cricket.\nBy the June 2023 ICC rules, the main differences are:\nClothing and equipment.\nInitially, like men, women played cricket in clothes that were similar to their everyday wear. With changes in womenswear in the late Victorian period, clothes for middle-and-upper-class women to undertake physical activity became more available. The Rational Dress Society had an outfit for cricket in its 1883 catalogue.\nDuring the interwar period, women's sportswear became more available and the Women's Cricket Association (WCA) encountered something they named \"the clothing problem\". The debate about what women should wear when playing cricket was intense; a debate about it can be found in the minutes of every Annual General Meeting of the WCA from its foundation until its last AGM before World War II. There was tension between the needs of female players who wished to wear comfortable, practical clothing, and the need to appear as \"respectable\" women to the public and to the male establishment who owned the cricket grounds. There was also anxiety about women cross-dressing and the need to maintain gender roles while playing sport.\nPhotographs in the British press in the early 20th century often showed women playing cricket with bare legs and in bathing costumes but most played in more-practical clothing. Rules about women playing in white dresses and skirts were imposed on high-level women's cricket but in local games, it was common to play in flannels of any colour.\nFollowing England's first tour of Australia and New Zealand, the England, Australia and New Zealand teams adopted the white divided skirts as part of their uniforms. England continued to play in skirts until 1997. Diving for the ball in a skirt risked injury and friction burns. The move to trousers eliminated this danger for women players, and the tan lines between the bottom of the skirts and the socks. The New Zealand team were given a sewing pattern and fabric, and were expected to make their uniforms or have them made.\nAccording to the 2023 ICC rules, the rules on men's and women's attire in international cricket are identical. The only gender-specific clothing rule allows cricketers to wear hijab in ICC events provided it does not obscure any logos and names on the playing uniform. For Test matches, scarves must be black or white but for ODIs and T20s, they can be black or the same colour as the team cap but they cannot be white.\nAppropriate equipment has long been an issue for women in cricket. Players have often had to use poorly fitting small men's or juniors equipment, which impeded performance. England wicket keeper Betty Snowball avoided this problem by having her gloves and pads custom made. Many women players prefer smaller, lighter bats. Labeling of equipment has been exclusionary; equipment for children has been labelled as \"boys\" but this has begun to change. Present and former cricketers, such as Lydia Greenway, Ellyse Perry and Heather Knight, have been involved with leading changes in the design of equipment for women. The brands Kookaburra, SM Cricket, Viking, Gray-Nicolls and JPGavan all now produce equipment intended for women. The brands NEXX and Lacuna Sports have been launched in the UK to provide clothing and equipment to women who play cricket.\nInternational cricket.\nWomen's cricket has been played internationally since the inaugural women's Test match between England's and Australia's women's teams in December 1934. The following year, New Zealand joined them. in 2007 Netherlands became the tenth women's Test nation in their debut against South Africa. A total of 145 women's Test matches have been played.\nWomen's One Day Internationals (ODIs) were introduced in 1973 at the inaugural Women's Cricket World Cup. The 1,000th women's ODI took place in 2016. Australia has dominated the format, having claimed the World Cup six times and won 80% of their matches.\nIn 2004, a shorter-still format, the Twenty20 International (T20I) was introduced; matches are restricted to twenty overs per side. Initially, women's T20 cricket was played little at international level; four matches were played by the end of 2006. The following three years saw a rapid growth in women's T20 Internationals; six matches were played in 2007, ten in 2008 and thirty in 2009, which also saw the first ICC Women's World Twenty20. In April 2018, the ICC granted its members full women's T20 International status.\nIn November 2021, the ICC retrospectively applied first-class and List A status to women's cricket, aligning it with the men's game.\nIn July 2023, the ICC announced equal prize money will be available for ICC global events, meaning future Women's Cricket World Cup and Women's T20 World Cup competitions will have the same prizes for winners and runners up as male competitions.\nInternational rankings.\nThe ICC maintains rankings of the 13 teams with ODI status and all teams who play T20I matches. , Australia top both tables.\nThe ICC also maintains individual player rankings in ODI and T20I based on batting, bowling and all-round performance.\nSeries trophies.\nThe men's game has a long history of perpetual trophies but there are two only in women's cricket: The Women's Ashes and The Rose Bowl.\nIn 1998, the Women's Cricket Association (WCA) created a set of Ashes to be contested by Australia and England. The Australia and England men's teams play for their own set of Ashes. In 2013, it changed from being a Test series to a series of ODIs, T20Is and a Test to better reflect the formats of cricket women regularly play.\nThe Rose Bowl is an ODI series played between Australia and New Zealand, and has been contested since the 1984–85 season, the most-recent being in 2020.\nBefore the start of the 2023–24 series, the Pakistan captain Nida Dar and South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt revealed an as-yet-unnamed new trophy for their teams to contest.\nTournaments.\nAsia Cup.\nThe Asia Cup began in 2004 as an ODI competition between members of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). It initially ran every two years until 2008, then reformed in 2012 as a T20 tournament. The ACC intend to continue to run in it biannually, although on several occasions it has run every four years. The change to T20 cricket allowed the ACC to include more Associate nations in the tournament.\nCricket World Cup.\nThe first ever Cricket World Cup was the Women's Cricket World Cup organised in 1973 by the WCA; it was based on an idea of cricketer Rachael Heyhoe Flint and businessman Jack Hayward. After the success of the Women's Cricket World Cup, the men's tournament took place two years later.\nSeven teams competed in the inaugural tournament, which took place in England over five and a half weeks. Each ODI match was 60 overs and every team played each other in a round-robin league format. Subsequent tournaments were hampered by lack of funds for women's teams, meaning their scheduling was inconsistent for many years. The 1997 World Cup was the first to be played with 50 overs and a knock-out stage.\nSince the inaugural tournament, there have been 12 World Cups with the 13th planned for 2025 in India.\nKwibuka T20 Tournament.\nOriginally called the \"Kwibuka Cricket for Peace Women's T20 Tournament\", the Kwibuka T20 Tournament is an annual T20 tournament that is played in Rwanda. It was founded in 2014 to mark the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and to promote peace through cricket. It is unusual among women's tournaments because there is no male equivalent. African nations including Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda, and the hosts Rwanda compete in the tournament. The Brazilian and German teams have also taken part.\nThe word 'Kwibuka' means \"to remember\" in Kinyarwanda, the Rwandan national language, and is the title of annual commemorations of the genocide.\nAt multi-sport events.\nFollowing the introduction of T20 cricket, cricket has been included at several multi-sport events; the women's game is often added after the successful establishment of a men's tournament. , five different major games have held women's cricket medal events; a sixth – the African Games – is scheduled for early 2024 and a seventh – the Olympics – is scheduled for 2028.\nAfrican Games.\nThe 2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana will mark the game's debut in the African Games.\nAsian Games.\nCricket made its debut at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, with men's and women's T20 cricket matches. It returned for the 2014 Asian Games Cricket was removed from the 2018 Asian Games to reduce the burden on the Indonesian organisers.\nThe 2022 Asian Games were delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic but cricket returned when the Games were held in September 2023. Eight teams competed, including India who sent a team to the games for the first time and went home with their first gold medal.\nCommonwealth Games.\nIn August 2019, the Commonwealth Games Foundation announced the addition of women's cricket to the 2022 Commonwealth Games. The matches were held at Edgbaston, and included eight teams competing in a T20 format during July and August 2022. Only a women's tournament was part of the Games.\nOlympic Games.\nWomen's cricket has never been included in the Olympic Games. There was hope T20 cricket would be included in the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. It was on the shortlist for inclusion but was not chosen for the 28-sport provisional list, making its inclusion unlikely. The ultimate decision was made in October 2023 at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee Executive board by the nod of inclusion of cricket in 2028.\nWith the 2032 Summer Olympic Games being hosted in Brisbane, Australia, the governing body Cricket Australia have also have noted their intention to have the game included.\nPacific Games.\nMen's cricket has been part of the Pacific Games since 1979 and a women's competition was introduced for the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. It appeared again at the 2019 Pacific Games but was dropped for the 2023 games.\nSouth Asian Games.\nWomen's cricket made its debut at the 2019 South Asian Games in Pokhara, Nepal, in the T20 format. The Maldives set one of the lowest scores in International Women's Cricket, all out for 8 runs.\nSoutheast Asian Games.\nCricket made its debut at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It did not appear in another Southeast Asian Games until the 2023 Games.\nUnusually among modern multi-sport events, the SEA Games do not keep to just the T20 format. For the 2017 tournament, women only played T20 but for the 2023 tournament they competed in 6s, T10, T20 and 50-over competitions and each had medals available.\nDomestic.\nThe majority of high-level women's domestic cricket in ICC Full Member countries consists of 50-over and Twenty20 competitions.\nAfghanistan.\nSince the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul in 2021, cricket for women is in practice banned due to the Taliban's policies on women.\nAustralia.\nEight state-based teams play 50-over cricket in the Women's National Cricket League, which has run since the 1996–97 season. Since the 2015–16 season, eight city-based franchises have played T20 cricket in the Women's Big Bash League.\nBangladesh.\nThe Bangladesh Women's National Cricket League has been played variously as a 50-over and a Twenty20 competition.\nEngland.\nEight regional teams compete in the 50-over Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy and the Twenty20 Charlotte Edwards Cup, while eight city-based teams compete in The Hundred, a 100-ball cricket competition. The English counties play in the Women's Twenty20 Cup.\nPreviously, the English counties played in the Women's County Championship, while six semi-professional teams played in the Women's Cricket Super League.\nTo grow women's participation in the game, including those who have never played cricket, in 2017, the England and Wales Cricket Board created a format called softball cricket. It uses a modified scoring system, has 6-to-8 players per team and lasts just over an hour.
