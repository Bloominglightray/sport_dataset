        "title": "Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball",
        "text": "The Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball team represents the University of Mississippi in the sport of basketball. The Rebels compete in the NCAA Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They started the 2015–16 season playing home games at Tad Smith Coliseum on the university's Oxford campus, but played their final game in that facility on December 22, 2015. The Rebels opened a new on-campus arena, The Pavilion at Ole Miss, on January 7, 2016. The Rebels were led by 12-year head coach Andy Kennedy until his resignation on February 18, 2018. Tony Madlock, an assistant under Kennedy, served as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. On March 15, 2018, the school hired former Middle Tennessee head coach Kermit Davis as the new head coach and was formally introduced on March 19. Davis was fired in his sixth season on February 24, 2023, after posting a 2–13 conference record with two games remaining on the schedule. Assistant coach Win Case took over as interim coach for the remainder of the season.\nOle Miss has made the NCAA tournament on eight occasions and reached the Sweet Sixteen in 2001. The Rebels have participated in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 11 times. In 2008 and 2010, they made it to the NIT Semifinals at Madison Square Garden. The Rebels have won the SEC Western Division five times.\nRecent history.\nRob Evans arrived in Oxford in 1992 as the school's first black coach in a revenue sport. He led the Rebels to only their second and third NCAA Tournament appearances in school history, in 1997 and 1998. These were also the first 20-win seasons in school history; the Rebels had been one of the few longstanding members of a \"power conference\" to have never tallied a 20-win season\nEvans left for Arizona State in 1998. His top assistant, Rod Barnes, took over at Ole Miss and compiled a record of 141–109 during his eight-year tenure. During his tenure, the Rebels reached the 1999, 2001, and 2002 NCAA Tournaments. The 1998–99 team notched the school's first-ever NCAA Tournament win, while the 2001 team advanced all the way to the Sweet 16. His tenure crested at that point, however, and he would not have another winning season after 2002.\nFollowing the 2005–06 season, Ole Miss hired Andy Kennedy, and the Rebels tied for first place in the SEC West during the 2006–07 season. Led by the senior trio of Clarence Sanders, Bam Doyne, and Todd Abernethy, the Ole Miss men finished the year with a 21–13 record, including a 16–1 record at home inside Tad Smith Coliseum. They advanced to the second round of the NIT, before falling at Clemson. In his debut season with the Rebels, Kennedy was named the 2007 SEC Coach of the Year by the Associated Press after guiding Ole Miss, a preseason last-place pick in the SEC West, to its first division title and most wins since 2001.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Ole Miss won just their second SEC tournament title and made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2002. Ole Miss also set a school record for most SEC wins in a season. Kennedy was again named SEC Coach of the Year. On February 23, 2013, Kennedy became the all-time winningest coach at Ole Miss.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Rebels have appeared in the NCAA tournament nine times. Their combined record is 5–9.\nNIT results.\nThe Rebels have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 15–13."

        "title": "Venues of the 2002 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The 2002 Winter Olympic Games were held in and around Salt Lake City, United States from February 8 to 24, 2002, and the Paralympics from March 7 to 16, 2002. The sporting events were held in ten competitive venues, while non-competitive events, such as the opening ceremony, were held in six other venues. Three venues were also created for training purposes. All Olympic venues were scattered throughout Northern Utah and the Wasatch Front. \nIn November 1989, Utah's voters passed the Olympic referendum, which allowed construction to begin on a few of the future Olympic venues with the 1998 Winter Olympics on the mind.The construction was to proceed using public funds which would be repaid with profits following the games. As part of the referendum, the state created the Utah Sports Authority, who would work closely with the Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee and other Olympic organizers to ensure the venues complied with Olympic standards. Two years later, Salt Lake City lost its bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics,but the plans continued. By the time Salt Lake City bid again, the venues had been completed in 1995. On June 16, 1995, the International Olympic Committee awarded Salt Lake City the XIX Winter Olympics, with the newly completed venues cited as one of the key factors in the successful bid.\nThe Utah Sports Authority constructed two of the Olympic venues: the Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval. Prior to the games, the authority turned over ownership of the venues to the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC), who turned the ownership of the venues over to the Utah Athletic Foundation after the games.\nCompetitive Venues.\nDeer Valley Resort.\nThe Deer Valley Resort is located east of downtown Salt Lake City, in Park City, Utah. Deer Valley has been a popular skiing location since the 1930s, and was improved by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) who built many of its first ski trails and other facilities during the winter of 1936–37. In 1946, local citizens built the first ski lifts, and the area became known as \"Snow Park\". In 1981, a private resort officially opened in the same area as Deer Valley, and has grown to include six mountains with six bowls, of glade skiing and of snow-making. The resort totals in size.\nDuring the 2002 games, Deer Valley Resort hosted the freestyle moguls and aerials and alpine slalom events. Three of the resort's runs were used during the games, including \"Champion\" (site of freestyle moguls), \"Know You Don't\" (site of alpine slalom), and \"White Owl\" (site of freestyle aerials). The spectator stadium located at the end of each run was 12 stories tall and included seating for 10,000 people, while spectator standing areas were located along the sides of each course. The standing areas and stadium combined allowed roughly 13,300 spectators to view each event, with 99.4 percent of tickets sold. During the games, 95 percent of Deer Valley remained open to the public for normal seasonal operations.\nE Center.\nOriginally known as the E Center, the Maverik Center is located west of downtown Salt Lake City in West Valley City. In July 1995, only a month after winning the Olympic bid, SLOC accepted a proposal from West Valley City to build a new ice hockey facility in the city. SLOC loaned $7 million to the city for construction costs, and would rent the arena from the city during the games. The arena would be funded through a variety of ways, but would be owned the municipality of West Valley City, and used for various events before and after the games. Ground was broken for the E Center on March 22, 1996, and the arena was completed in September 1997. The arena was designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport), cost $54.1 million to construct, and was dedicated on September 19, 1997. The first event held at the new venue was WCW's \"Monday Nitro Live\" on September 22, 1997.\nAs the home of the Utah Grizzlies, the E Center served as one of the two venues for ice hockey during the 2002 games. The hockey events held in the venue were spread out during six days in 31 sessions, and it was capable of holding 8,400 spectators, plus press members, during the competitions. 96.7 percent of available tickets were sold, for a total of 230,657 spectators witnessing events in the arena. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics, the arena hosted the ice sledge hockey events.\nPark City Mountain Resort.\nPark City Mountain Resort is located east of downtown Salt Lake City, in Park City, Utah. It was opened as Treasure Mountain by United Park City Mines on December 21, 1963, as the last surviving mining company in Park City, with funds from a federal government program meant to revive the economically depressed town. When it originally opened, it boasted the longest gondola in the United States, as well as a double chairlift, a J-bar lift, base and summit lodges, and a nine-hole golf course. A special \"Skier's Subway\" was used to transport skiers nearly into the mountain through the pitch-black Spiro Tunnel on a mine train, where skiers then boarded a mining elevator that lifted them to the surface, from there they had access to the entire mountain. Treasure Mountain's name was changed to the Park City Ski Area for its fourth season of 1966–67, and it eventually became known as the Park City Mountain Resort. The resort has grown to include eight peaks and nine bowls, with of skiing and 16 lifts.\nDuring the 2002 games, the resort hosted the men's and women's giant slalom, men's and women's snowboarding parallel giant slalom, and men's and women's snowboarding halfpipe events. The resort's Eagle Race Arena and Eagle Superpipe were used as the Olympics runs. Temporary stadiums were erected at the end of each run with spectator standing areas on each side, creating a combined capacity of 16,500 persons. 99.8 percent of available tickets for events at the resort were sold, for a total of 95,991 spectators witnessing events at the resort. During the games, 96 percent of the resort was open to normal seasonal operations, and was the only venue to allow spectators to leave and reenter.\nThe Peaks Ice Arena.\nThe Peaks Ice Arena is located south of downtown Salt Lake City, in Provo, Utah. Provo was chosen as the site for an Olympic venue because the leaders of Utah County refused to support Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum unless they were promised at least one Olympic event would be held in the county. Originally, county leaders wanted the speed skating oval built somewhere in Provo, or on the campus of Utah Valley Community College; others suggested the Games' closing ceremony be held at Brigham Young University's Cougar Stadium. After the 1989 Olympic referendum passed and Salt Lake City lost its 1991 bid to host the 1998 Winter Olympics, the Utah Sports Authority and Provo City decided to wait until Salt Lake City bid again for the 2002 Winter Olympics before beginning construction on the arena.\nAfter Salt Lake City won the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995, planning began again for what venue Utah County would host, and an ice sheet was decided upon. On September 17, 1997, ground was broken for construction of the new arena. It was to be a building, with two ice sheets side by side. One ice sheet would have seating for about 2,000 spectators while the other would seat 300. By the time ground was broken, the price had increased to $8.5 million, $1.5 million more than originally planned, paid for by Seven Peaks. After construction had already begun, the SLOC decided to host hockey events at the new arena rather than using Utah Valley State College's McKay Center. The SLOC would contribute $5.25 million towards the project, whose cost had just jumped to $10.75 million, with the addition of 12 locker rooms instead of four, 8,000 seats (2,300 of which would be permanent), and other minor expansions to the original plan.\nThe arena opened November 20, 1998, in what was considered a \"soft opening\", and following the completion of minor work, the arena was supposed to have a grand opening in January or February 1999. In December 1998, however, allegations of a scandal involving members of the SLOC and the International Olympic Committee concerning the 2002 Olympic bid surfaced, pushing back the grand opening. The arena was finally opened on September 29, 1999, and hosted its first event, a hockey game between the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs and the University of Calgary Oval Extremes, two days later. The completed arena cost $12.4 million to build, included two ice sheets, had seating for over 2,000 spectators, and was in size.\nDuring the 2002 games, both men's and women's ice hockey games and practices were held at the arena. Because of its original size, over 6,000 temporary seats had to be installed to boost the ice center's capacity to 8,400, including press members. 93 percent of tickets were sold, for a total 131,067 of spectators witnessing events in the arena.\nSalt Lake Ice Center.\nThe Delta Center (renamed Salt Lake Ice Center for the duration of the Games due to IOC sponsorship rules) opened in 1991 as the new home arena for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nIt hosted the figure skating events and the short track speed skating event. The arena was capable of holding an average of 14,600 spectators for each session, and 100 percent of available tickets for events in the arena were sold, for a total of 145,997 spectators witnessing events in the Ice Center. Because it was normally a basketball arena, several changes to the floor, and seating configurations had to be made. In order to create an Olympic-sized ice rink, the lower levels of seating had to be retracted, making the first level of spectator seating several feet higher than the skater's heads, a problem coined \"the Pit\". The Utah Jazz played their last home game on February 2, 2002, giving organizers less than a week to transform the arena in time for the games. Temporary changes included a separate audio system capable of producing higher quality sound, new scoreboards, the removal 1,200 seats to make room for media tables, building camera platforms, and the removal of Utah Jazz paraphernalia.\nSnowbasin.\nSnowbasin is located northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, in Weber County, Utah, and is one of the oldest continuously operating ski areas in the United States. Following the end of World War I and the Great Depression, numerous small ski resorts were developed in Utah's snow-packed mountains. Eager to capitalize on this growth, Weber County decided to redevelop the area in and around Wheeler Basin, a deteriorated watershed area that had been overgrazed and subjected to aggressive timber-harvesting. Lands were restored and turned over to the US Forest Service, and by 1938, the Forest Service and Alf Engen had committed to turning the area into a recreational site. In 1939, the first ski tow was built and in service at the new Snow Basin ski park. Over the past 70 years, the resort has grown to include 104 runs, 12 lifts, and of Skiable area.\nDuring the 2002 games, Snowbasin hosted the downhill, combined (downhill and slalom), and super-G events. The spectator viewing areas consisted of a stadium at the foot of the run, with two sections of snow terraces for standing along both sides of the run. The spectator capacity was 22,500 per event; 99.1 percent of tickets were sold, and 124,373 spectators were able to view events at the Snowbasin Olympic venue. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics, Snowbasin hosted the Alpine Skiing events, including downhill, super-G, slalom, and giant slalom.\nSoldier Hollow.\nSoldier Hollow is located southeast of downtown Salt Lake City, in the Wasatch Mountain State Park near Midway, Utah. It was the furthest venue from Salt Lake City, with an estimated drive time of 2 to hours from downtown during the games. The venue was one of only three which was built and designed by SLOC specifically for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Soldier Hollow was chosen by the SLOC as an Olympic venue in October 1997 over several other possible locations including Sherwood Hills near Logan, Utah. Preliminary work began soon after the venue site was chosen, but major construction did not begin until 1999. Construction on the venue had been completed enough (80% complete) to host its first major event, the U.S. Cross Country Championships, on January 8, 2000. Construction on the venue's day lodge began with a groundbreaking ceremony on July 5, 2000. The lodge was completed in December 2000, and dedicated on January 5, 2001. The venue cost SLOC $22 million to construct, and is still in use today.\nDuring the 2002 games, Soldier Hollow hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing, and Nordic combined events. The venue itself hosted 64,160 biathlon spectators, 99,320 cross-country spectators, and 1,794 Nordic combined spectators during these events. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics, it hosted the biathlon and cross-country events.\nBecause of its distance from Salt Lake City and other large population centers of Utah, a special \"Western Experience\" was created at the venue's spectator plaza to give visitors activities to do between competitions. The Western Experience included music and entertainment, a mountain rendezvous, pioneer reenactments, cowboy camps, a wild mustang exhibit, and American Indian displays.\nIn order to help cut down on vehicle traffic in the canyons, and to give spectators a unique experience, the SLOC reached an agreement with the Historic Heber Valley Railroad to transport spectators to the Soldier Hollow venues. A special station was constructed along the railroad's tracks near the venue which would allow two to four trains carrying 200 passengers each per day. The former Union Pacific No. 618 steam-engine would pull an eight-car train carrying the passengers to the Soldier Hollow depot, where they disembarked and continued to the venue entrance on a horse-drawn sleigh.\nThe Ice Sheet at Ogden.\nThe Ice Sheet at Ogden is located north of downtown Salt Lake City, on the campus of Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. Following the passage of Utah's 1989 Olympic referendum, Ogden submitted a proposal to the Utah Sports Authority and Utah's Olympic organizers to construct an Olympic-sized practice ice sheet in the city. On September 10, 1990, the Utah Sports Authority selected a site near the Dee Events Center in Ogden as the site of an Olympic ice sheet over other locations in downtown Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah. The property for the venue would be leased from Weber State University for 50 years. A groundbreaking ceremony at the start of construction was held on December 17, 1992. The facility was to cost $5.9 million, with $3 million from the State of Utah (as authorized in the 1989 Olympic referendum), $2 million from Weber County, and the remainder from private donations. Following the venue's completion, a two-day grand opening was held on April 2–3, 1994, which included performances by Olympian Scott Hamilton and U.S. Champions Todd Sands and Jennifer Menno. By the time it was completed, the price had gone up to $6.2 million, and the arena had seating for 2,000 spectators and was in size. It was originally designed to be used for practice and preliminary competitions among ice skaters and hockey teams for the 2002 Winter Olympics. It was later decided that the ice sheet would be used for curling, and the ice sheet closed to replace the sand-based floor with a more efficient concrete floor on May 2, 1999. The sand-based flooring allowed freezing tubes to shift, causing uneven ridges in the ice. The new concrete floor was finished in July 1999, and the ice sheet reopened for public use within weeks.\nDuring the 2002 games, the Ice Sheet at Ogden hosted the curling events, which had been introduced in the 1998 Winter Olympics. The venue held about 2,000 spectators, and 96.7 percent of tickets were sold, with a total of 40,572 spectators witnessing events at the ice sheet.\nUtah Olympic Oval.\nThe Utah Olympic Oval is located west of downtown Salt Lake City, in Kearns, Utah. Along with Soldier Hollow, and the Utah Olympic Park it was built specifically for the 2002 Winter Olympics. On October 5, 1992, the Utah Sports Authority chose the Oquirrh Park Fitness Center in Kearns as the site for the 2002 Olympic Oval, beating out other locations in West Valley City, Sandy and downtown Salt Lake City. Funds from the 1989 Olympic referendum would be used to construct the oval, and would be repaid with profits from the games. The plans called to use $3.7 million of tax payer money to construct the oval, which would be an outdoor facility. If Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid for the 2002 games, Olympic revenues would be used to cover the oval and build an ice sheet in the center of the track. By the time the groundbreaking ceremony was held in May 1994, the price tag had increased to $4.1 million, with an expected completion date sometime that December. Because of cold temperatures and a wet spring, cement for the oval could not be poured, and the oval didn't open until September 1, 1995, almost a year behind schedule. The oval was formally dedicated in a ceremony, attended by Olympian Cathy Turner, on January 12, 1996. Prior to it being covered and used during the Olympic Games, the oval would be used for inline skating during the summer and ice skating during the winter months.\nAfter the SLOC began the design process for a permanent cover, it was decided to pull up and replace the entire oval, a process which began in June 1999. The new oval was designed by Gilles Stransky Brems Smith (GSBS) Architects of Salt Lake City and constructed by Layton Construction, with an estimated cost was $27 million. To keep costs down, and give an unobstructed view of the ice, the roof would be constructed similar to a suspension bridge. Between twenty-four masts, twelve on each side of the building, steel cables nearly long and inches in diameter were strung, suspending the roof above the oval. Once it was completed, the building would be the size of four football fields, and housed two hockey-sized ice sheets in the center, the 400-meter speed skating track. Work on the oval was completed in time to host its first event, the World Single Distance Championships, in March 2001.\nDuring its construction, the oval was expected to become the world's fastest, mainly because of its elevation. It is the world's highest indoor oval at above sea level, higher than Calgary's Olympic Oval, the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics. Because of the elevation, there is less air resistance for the skaters and less oxygen frozen into the ice, making it harder, denser and faster.\nDuring the 2002 games, the oval hosted the speed skating events. Temporary seating was installed and the oval had a capacity for about 5,200 spectators plus press members. 100 percent of available tickets for the venue's events were sold, allowing 53,056 spectators to witness events in the oval.\nUtah Olympic Park.\nThe Utah Olympic Park is located east of downtown Salt Lake City, near Park City, Utah. Like the Utah Olympic Oval and Soldier Hollow, the park was designed and built under the supervision of SLOC. The 1989 Olympic referendum, which was passed by Utahns, allowed for tax payer money to fund a winter sports park that would be used if Salt Lake City won their bids for the 1998 or 2002 Winter Olympics. In 1990, the Utah Sports Authority announced their plans to build the park, which included ski jumps and a bobsled-luge track, in Bear Hollow near Park city. A groundbreaking ceremony was held May 29, 1991, when construction on the park got underway. The park had an estimated cost of $26.3 million, and was planned to be completed in September 1992, including the ski jumps, bobsled-luge track, a lodge and ski museum. Four of the park's ski jumps (18, 38, 65 and 90 meters) were completed and opened on December 12, 1992, and were formally dedicated in a ceremony on January 9, 1993. On July 31, 1993, the summer training facilities at the park, which included an aerial and mogul water ramp training pool, were dedicated.\nA groundbreaking ceremony on June 3, 1994, signaled the start of construction on the Bobsled-luge track. The track was completed December 28, 1996, and the grand opening was held on January 25, 1997. The very first run on the new track was by luger Jon Owen on January 10, 1997. The day lodge was also completed.\nWhile construction was progressing on the track, Salt Lake City won its 1995 bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, and plans were developed to expand the park. On October 9, 1997, the SLOC okayed the plan to spend an additional $48 million to upgrade and expand the park. The plans called for replacing the existing 90-meter ski jump, and building a new 120-meter jump. The construction of starting houses on the track, chairlifts, storage buildings, new access roads, pedestrian bridges, parking and sewer and water lines were part of the plan. The transform of the park began during the summer of 1998, and ownership of the park was transferred from the Utah Sports Authority to the SLOC on July 14, 1999. In Spring 2000 the Utah Winter Sports Park became the Utah Olympic Park, and the majority of expansion work was completed by that fall.\nNon-competitive venues.\nMain Media Center.\nThe Main Media Center (MMC) was located in the Salt Palace Convention Center in downtown Salt Lake City, and hosted both the International Broadcast Center (IBC) and the Main Press Center (MPC) during the games. The Salt Palace Convention Center was the second building in Salt Lake City to carry that name, the first having been destroyed by fire in 1910. The Salt Palace used during the Olympics had originally been constructed in 1969, pushed by Salt Lake's failed bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics. It was an arena with a capacity of 10,725 spectators, but after Salt Lake lost its bid, the arena became the home of the Utah Stars and the NBA's Utah Jazz. After the Utah Jazz moved next door to the newly constructed Delta Center, the majority of the Salt Palace was demolished, including the arena. What remained was remodeled and expanded to create the Convention Center used during the games.\nThe Main Media Center had a total of of exhibit space, of meeting space including a grand ballroom, and 66 meeting rooms. It had a total capacity of 20,000 people, and more than of fiber-optic cable installed in Salt Lake City allowed the MMC to hand 2 million inbound calls a day.\nOlympic Medals Plaza.\nThe Olympic Medals Plaza was located on the corner of South Temple and 300 West (block 85) in downtown Salt Lake City, within the Olympic Square. It was one of a few completely temporary venues, which was removed following the completion of both the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Paralympics. The site of the Medals Plaza is a parking lot owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is often used for temporary events. The Church donated free use of the property for the 2002 games, along with $5 million to transform the parking lot into an Olympic class Medals Plaza. On August 11, 1999, the same day the plaza's location was announced, a tornado hit downtown Salt Lake City, killing one man at the site of the future plaza. Some of Salt Lake's citizens, including many in its City Council, had preferred Washington Square (the site of the City &amp; County Building) or Pioneer Park as the location for the Medals Plaza. Nevertheless, the SLOC accepted the Church's offer because they were willing to help pay the costs, and the parking lot was an entire city block in size, which would allow a large number of spectators. Construction on the plaza began December 3, 2001, and was finished as the plaza was unveiled to the press on January 25, 2002.\nThe plaza could hold 20,000 spectators, with 9,000 in the stands and another 11,000 in standing areas. The stage, which was centered directly in front, was kept hidden by a metal curtain known as the Hoberman Arch, and flanked by two large 22 by video screens. The stage was decorated with a large 3D version of the Olympic logo, which held a second Olympic cauldron known as the Hero's Cauldron. A large lighting/production tower stood directly in front of the stage, and was surrounded by the standing areas. The plaza also included an NBC studio, and a three-story building with 17 boxed suites; rented out for $92,500 each.\nEvery night following the presentation of the medals, an Olympic Celebration Concert would be held. A different artist performed every night, and American footballer Steve Young hosted the event; following each concert was a firework display. The Medals Plaza also hosted the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics on March 16, 2002.\nOlympic Village.\nThe 2002 Olympic Village was located east of downtown Salt Lake City, at Historic Fort Douglas, on the campus of the University of Utah. Fort Douglas, a U.S. Army base, had been established in 1862, but was closed in 1991; from the earliest stages of Olympic planning, the fort was a possible location for the Olympic Village. Following the fort's closure, the University of Utah acquired much of its property and began planning to restore the historic buildings and build new dorms and apartment buildings for its students on the property. The SLOC agreed to pay $28 million of the projected $80 million construction cost if the buildings could be used to house up to 4,000 Olympic athletes during the games. Several Army reserve units that were still located at the fort had to be moved to nearby military installations, such as the Ogden Defense Depot and Camp Williams before work on the village could progress. However, in October 1997, President Bill Clinton vetoed a $12.7 million appropriation bill that would have allowed the remaining military units to move, and temporarily killed the plans for the Olympic Village. On October 24, 1997, the Senate Appropriations Committee overturned the President's veto, and both houses of congress later voted in favor the committee's decision, effectively voiding the President's veto. Prior to the start of construction, a $500,000 archaeological survey of the sites was completed.\nPlans were completed and work on the Olympic Village began in summer 1998. The project was to include the restoration of many historic buildings and the construction of 21 low-rise apartment buildings. The first phase of construction, a six-building complex for graduate student housing, was completed September 7, 1999, while future phases were almost completed when the future village open for media tours on January 26, 2001. As part of the plan, the Legacy Bridge was built, spanning Wasatch Boulevard.\nDuring the 2002 games, the Olympic Village housed the athletes, coaches and other officials, many of the historic buildings in the fort housed services for the athletes including 24-hour dining facilities, a fitness center, an internet center, a bank, dry cleaning, mail services, a photo shop, salon, nightclub, and interfaith chapel. The village was divided into two parts: the International Zone and Residential Zone. The International Zone was where media and guests could visit the village, and where many of the athlete services were located. The Residential Zone was for athletes and invited guests only, and included the chapel and nightclub. The Olympic Family Hotel was also located inside the village during the games. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics, the Olympic Village also served the paralympic athletes. Prior to the Olympics the parts of the village that had been completed were used as student housing, their post-Olympic use also.\nPark City Main Street.\nDuring the 2002 games, much of Park City's Main Street was closed to all but pedestrians. The Main Street Celebration area included three large video screens with Olympic coverage, an NBC broadcast area, performing artists, pin trading, sponsor showcases, food and entertainment. The Main Street Celebration was open from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., free of charge. The Park City Technical Center was also part of this venue.\nRice–Eccles Olympic Stadium.\nRice-Eccles Stadium is an American football stadium located east of downtown Salt Lake City, on the campus of the University of Utah. It is the home field of the Utah Utes, and sits at an elevation of above sea level, and above downtown Salt Lake City. Rice-Eccles Stadium had its start when the university built Ute Stadium in 1927, and the stadium was expanded and improved. By the time Salt Lake City won its Olympic bid in 1995, Rice Stadium (as it was then known) had a spectator capacity of only 32,500. Plans called for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2002 games to be held at the stadium, and with this in mind, the stadium was almost completely demolished after the 1997 football season. Expansion work was completed in fall 1998, and the stadium opened for the first game of the season on September 12, 1998, with seating for 45,017 spectators.\nThe stadium served as the venue for the opening ceremony on February 8, 2002, and for the closing ceremony on February 24, 2002. In order to host the ceremonies, the grass field was paved over with asphalt, and a stage was constructed, the scoreboards were removed, flags and Olympic livery were installed, temporary seating was brought in (allowing more than 50,000 spectators), and the 2002 Olympic Cauldron was installed atop the southern bleachers. An estimated 3.5 billion people watched the opening and closing ceremonies on television through broadcasts from the stadium. The opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics was also held in the stadium on March 7, 2002.\nSalt Lake Olympic Square.\nThe Salt Lake Olympic Square was located in downtown Salt Lake City, and was a four-block area open only to pedestrians during the 2002 games. The Olympic Square was home the Olympic Medals Plaza and the Salt Lake Ice Center, and also included the Olympic Superstore, which sold officially licensed products. The square also housed the Sponsor Showcases and featured live music, food, drinks and other activities, including the Olympic Celebration Series concerts. The square, open from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m., was open to the public free of charge."

        "title": "Venues of the 2006 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, a total of fifteen sports venues were used. Venue construction ran from 2002 to 2005. Cesana Pariol had to have turns 17 and 18 modified following the Luge World Cup in January 2005, but they were not cleared out until October 2005. Winds postponed the Nordic combined team event for a day. Many of the venues served as host for the Winter Universidade the following year.\nBefore the Olympics.\nStadio Olimpico in 1934 was known as Stadio Benito Mussolini. For the FIFA World Cup that took place that year, the stadium hosted two matches, including the quarterfinal match between Czechoslovakia and Switzerland.\nTurin was selected by the Italian Olympic Committee to be selected to host the 2006 Winter Olympics in March 1998. It was awarded the 2006 Winter Olympics on 19 June 1999.\nCesana Pariol construction began in 2002 and was completed in 2004. After a Luge World Cup test event in January 2005 that was abandoned to accidents. This led to modifications of Turns 17 and 18 and a retest of the track that was approved by the International Luge Federation (FIL) in October 2005. Oval Lingotto opened on 9 December 2005. Palavela, constructed in 1961, was modified for the 2006 Games to host figure skating and short track speed skating events. San Sicario Fraiteve hosted an Alpine Skiing World Cup in February 2005, and was modified to make the women's super-G event more challenging. Torino Esposizinoi was constructed in 1949 and refurbished in time for the 2006 Games to host the preliminary ice hockey matches.\nVenues were selected between May 2001 and the summer of 2002. Construction of the venues ran between the summers of 2002 and 2005. The venues were turned over for use of the 2006 Games between the summer of 2005 and February 2006. New construction included Cesana Pariol, Cesana San Sicario, Pragelato, Pragelato Plan, and Sauze d'Ouix-Jouvencaux while the other venues used were refurbished or expanded. Sustainability efforts were applied on all venues, but the most noted in the Olympics report were Cesana Pariol and Pragelato Plan. The most expensive venue construction in the Mountain area was Cesana Pariol at €85.78 million while the most expensive city venue used for competition in the City area was Oval Lingotto at €74.27 million.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThe men's curling bronze medal match at Pinerolo between Great Britain and the United States was interrupted by a streaker wearing a rubber chicken as a loin cloth.\nAt Cesana Pariol, the women's singles luge event had thirteen crashes or near crashes during the four runs. Among those who crashed were American Samantha Retrosi who was knocked unconscious at the end of the second run while Italy's Anastasia Oberstolz-Antonova crashed out during the first run.\nDuring the men's super-G alpine skiing event at Sestriere Borgata, seventeen skiers had gone down the course in the morning portion of the event before it was halted to heavy snowfall. The event was restarted in the afternoon with all morning results cancelled. Norway's Kjetil André Aamodt won the event.\nSan Sicario Fraiteve had its women's downhill alpine skiing course modified at the request of Austria's Michaela Dorfmeister who complained that the course was too easy. Modifications included bigger jumps and steeper banks and it was after a women's super-G event that was a test event in 2005.\nDuring the ski jumping portion of the Nordic combined team event, it was postponed halfway through to strong winds. They resumed the next day with Germany having a 10-second lead over Austria going into the cross-country portion of the event. At the halfway point of the final leg, Austria's Mario Stecher overcame a 20-second deficit to defeat Germany's Jens Gaiser by 15.3 seconds.\nAfter the Olympics.\nOval Lingotto hosted the World Fencing Championships in 2006. Several of the venues used for the 2006 Games were also used for the Winter Universiade the following year. They included Bardonecchia, Pragelato, Cesana San Sicario, Palavela, Pinerolo, and Oval Lingotto. San Sicario Friateve's last World Cup event in alpine skiing was in 2007. Pragelato's last World Cup ski jumping event was in 2008. Bardonecchia's last snowboarding World Cup event was in 2009. Palavela hosted the World Figure Skating Championships in 2010. Cesana Pariol hosted the FIL European Luge Championships in 2008 and the FIL World Luge Championships three years later."

        "title": "2010–11 Stony Brook Seawolves men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2010–11 Stony Brook Seawolves men's basketball team represents Stony Brook University in the America East Conference. They are coached by Steve Pikiell, who is currently on his sixth year as a coach for Stony Brook. Stony Brook entered the year as the defending America East regular season champions after a year of school records and successes in the basketball program. Stony Brook currently competes at home in the Pritchard Gymnasium (Stony Brook Arena under renovations). The Seawolves were 2nd place (57pts) in the America East preseason poll behind a close first-place BU (62pts). The Seawolves received their largest broadcasting package in school history for the 2010–11 season including four games with the ESPN family of networks, and a series of games with MSG+.\nSeason.\nThe 2010–2011 season started with a season opener game against the Connecticut Huskies at the Gampel Pavilion resulting in a 79–52 loss to the eventual national champions. The Seawolves then opened their home season two days later with an 80–43 win against Division III Mount Ida. The Seawolves posted a second straight win at Monmouth on for a 51–49 end of the game for their first ever national broadcast on ESPN (College Tip-off Marathon). The Seawolves went on to win their third straight with a 66–59 over Fairleigh Dickinson. Coming back home the Seawolves played against Wagner, losing a close 58–54 game in which free-throws percentage largely affected the team. After the lost against Wagner, the Seawolves hosted Lehigh at the Gymnasium and at one point in the second half held to a 14-point lead, however, a late run by Lehigh allowed the team to get tie and eventually beat the Seawolves on overtime by a score of 79–76. The Seawolves then traveled to New York, NY to play a match up against the Columbia Lions, a game which the Seawolves lost by a score of 73–72 which resulted in the third straight lost by the Seawolves by four or less points, and the second straight lost in which the Seawolves held substantial leads in the second half but weren't able to close it. The Seawolves then traveled to Holy Cross to play a game which also resulted to be very close but which ended on Seawolves favor with a game winning layup by Dave Coley with a second of regulation to capture the Seawolves fourth win of the season, a score of 54–53. The Seawolves battled Sacred Heart but fell at home to a score of 75–66 and then traveled to South Bend, Indiana to face off against No. 24 Notre Dame, their second Big East team of the season. Seawolves battled Notre Dame for most of the first half keeping a score of 29–26 but allowed an 8–0 run to end the half leading to an eventual 88–62 loss.\nThe Seawolves opened conference play with a win against UMBC and continued throughout the season with struggles in the offensive end and with injuries affecting their sole senior Chris Martin and other players for most of the season. Due to injuries, Pikiell resorted to using the bench more often allowing for Sophomore like Leonard Hayes to get more playing time. Hayes was able to show his potential, entering the starting five and showing his improvement in the conference tournament. Overall, Stony Brook ended the regular season with a 13–16 record and 8–8 in the America East and headed to the tournament as the number fifth seed. In their quarterfinal match against Albany the Seawolves were able to use strong defense and a stellar offense to drag a 67–61 win against Albany at Hartford against an opponent that swept them in the regular season. The Semifinals then played the next day against No. 1 Vermont ending in a surprising offensive effort by Stony Brook, who led from the beginning to the end, to capture a 69–47 promising win against a Vermont team who also swept them in the regular season. For the first time in Stony Brook's Division I program history, the Seawolves were to participate in the America East championship game. Their next match up was announced to be the No. 2 Boston Terriers. On March 12 the Championship was hosted at Agganis Arena at Boston. Again, Stony Brook showed a strong first half outing and a strong defense for most of game and held to a lead of up to 15 points. However, with less than a minute in the clock the terriers tied the game thanks to the John Holland (America East POY), and then captured the lead with a decisive foul on Stony Brook with 2 seconds of regulation left. Boston went on to win 56–54 to end the Seawolves hopes for their first-ever NCAA tournament bid.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| America East tournament"

Having recovered, he reconsidered and in 1878 played in 33 matches, 24 of which are generally recognised as first-class. His main roles in the season were captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series. 1878 was a cold, wet summer and not one of Grace's better seasons as a batsman, but he was very effective in such conditions as a right arm medium pace roundarm bowler and completed a sixth successive \"double\" by scoring 1,151 runs and taking 152 wickets in the recognised first-class matches.\nGrace was always notorious for gamesmanship and moneymaking during his cricket career and he cut an especially controversial figure in 1878. After the season ended, he and his brother E. M. Grace were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership and a special enquiry was ordered to investigate their blatant \"shamateurism\". As amateur players, they should only have been claiming reasonable expenses for travel and accommodation but they were accused of claiming inflated expenses and appearance fees. The matter came to a head after Surrey County Cricket Club refused to meet their expense claims when Gloucestershire played at The Oval in June. Prior to the same match, Grace was accused of \"kidnapping\" the Australian player Billy Midwinter when he insisted that Midwinter was contractually bound to play for Gloucestershire and not the Australian touring team. A furious altercation between Grace and members of the Australian party took place in front of bystanders outside The Oval, but Grace got his way and Midwinter played for Gloucestershire.\nThe season was notable for the MCC v Australians match at Lord's in May. Grace played for MCC in the match that, completed in a single day, is considered a milestone in cricket history. In July, Gloucestershire made their first visit to Old Trafford to play Lancashire and the match was immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem \"At Lord's\".\nOn a personal level, Grace was still unqualified as a doctor and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor until the end of the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.\nBackground.\nIt is believed that Grace contemplated retirement from cricket in the winter of 1877–78. He had been seriously injured in a shooting accident in September 1877, which nearly cost him the sight of one eye, and this may have caused him to review his life. Still unqualified as a doctor and with a growing family to support, Grace had doubts about his long-term security even though he was making considerable profit from cricket by way of \"grossly inflated\" expense claims and appearance fees. Unexpectedly, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) solved his financial problems by voting him a National Testimonial with a view to purchasing a medical practice out of the proceeds. It was hoped that a regular income would \"end the embarrassment of his blatant shamateurism\". One of Grace's biographers, Bernard Darwin, who knew him personally, wrote that the arrival of the first Australian touring team \"tipped the beam in favour of cricket\" but it was also the case that no one, especially Grace, took the Australian players too seriously. It is more likely that A. J. Webbe was right when he said: \"W. G. never \"could\" have given up cricket\".\nGrace was living in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was assigned to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education. They lived in an Earl's Court apartment until autumn 1877 when they returned to Gloucestershire and lived with Grace's elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner (GP) at Kingswood, near Bristol. The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study a backlog of medical theory and, after the season ended, he was assigned to Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved back to London and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.\nBy the time Grace celebrated his 30th birthday in July 1878, he was arguably the most famous man in England; but he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking. Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878.\nMay: the season begins.\n1878 was a \"chilly and wet summer\" in which the bad wickets reduced \"all (batsmen) to comparative impotence\" but enabled bowlers to dominate and cause \"havoc\". This summed up Grace's season too, for he was outstanding in the field but he struggled with the bat, as his statistics plainly show.\nThe season began in cold, wet conditions and Grace did not start well. He was conscious of his domestic and medical distractions, the most pressing of which was the birth of his daughter just before the famous match at Lord's between MCC and the Australians.\nGrace's first match was for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against Twenty of Rochdale from Thursday, 2 May to Saturday, 4 May at Butcher's Meadow in Rochdale. The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although they saved the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, it was not an auspicious performance by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. It was another odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley.\nOn Thursday, 9 May, Grace was in Cambridge and played for an England XI against Cambridge University at Fenner's. This was a three-day match culminating on Saturday, 11 May and was the opening first-class fixture of the season. Cambridge had one of its strongest-ever teams in 1878 and won by 79 runs after having to follow on. Grace scored 45 and 11, and he was the outstanding bowler in the match with 10 wickets.\nGrace returned to London and played in his next match, starting on Monday, 13 May, for MCC against an England XI at Lord's. This was another first-class fixture, scheduled for three days but completed in two, the mostly professional England XI winning by 3 wickets. MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored by Grace himself with 47. England reached 75–6 at the close and were all out for 115 on Tuesday morning, but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, Grace having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. Grace was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was well supported by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. Grace bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3–43. Grace's 47 in the first innings was the top score in the game, the second highest being 30 by Arthur Shrewsbury for England. Grace sustained a thumb injury during the match which prevented him taking part in the England second innings.\nGrace was inactive for over a week after that match, partly because of his injury but also as his daughter was born in London, and his next appearance was in Ireland where he played for the USEE against 15 past and present players of Dublin University Cricket Club at its College Park venue. This match was played over three days, starting on Thursday, 23 May. A guest player in the USEE team was the Australian batsman Charles Bannerman. However, Grace and Bannerman scored just 11 and 1 respectively in the USEE first innings, while Fred Grace and Bannerman's fellow Australian Midwinter scored 46 and 64. The match was ruined by the weather and ended in a draw.\nOn Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team caught the ferry back to England and Grace continued by train to London, probably in the company of Bannerman and Midwinter, as all three were due to take part in another match at Lord's the following day. They could not have guessed that the match would be remembered as, to quote Grace's biographer Simon Rae, \"arguably the most momentous six hours in cricket history\".\nMonday, 27 May 1878 – MCC v Australians at Lord's.\n\"CricketArchive\" states without elaboration that: \"the match was scheduled for three days but completed in one\". Having won the toss, MCC were dismissed for 33 and then they bowled out the Australians for 41. MCC hoped for a better total in the afternoon but were skittled for a mere 19. The Australians needed 12 to win and were by no means sure of getting them, but they did, and won a sensational match by 9 wickets. With a match aggregate of 105 runs, it remains the lowest scoring first-class match on record. In his ghost-written \"Reminiscences\" (1899), Grace recalled that there had been \"only four and a half hours of actual cricket\" net of the lunch interval and breaks between innings.\nWith James Lillywhite acting as their agent, the first official Australian team to tour England was managed by John Conway and captained by Dave Gregory. As Billy Midwinter was already in England, he joined his compatriots ahead of their opening game. The other ten players in the party were Charles Bannerman, his brother Alec, future Test captain Billy Murdoch, wicket-keeper Jack Blackham, Frank Allan, George Bailey, Harry Boyle, Tom Garrett, Tom Horan and the original \"Demon Bowler\", Fred Spofforth.\nPlay started at three minutes past twelve on a \"sticky wicket\", a wet pitch drying out as the sun began to shine. Only a small crowd was present and it all began well enough for Grace as he hit the opening ball of the match from Allan for four. But another firm shot off his legs sent the second ball straight to Midwinter and Grace was \"easily caught at square leg\". Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5–2 but, with Hornby and Arthur Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was \"truly demonic\". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6–4 in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of George Hearne, Alfred Shaw and George Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41 but Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6–3 and Spofforth 4–16. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and they \"mobbed the Australians as they left the field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm\". Around 500 had been present at the start but the number grew to 4,742 by the end; the receipts of £119 7s were given to the Australians and MCC paid the expenses.\nSo ended a \"memorable day of cold and puddles and calamity\". Afterwards, the match was seized upon by the media and widely reported by the press. The news \"spread like wildfire and created a sensation in London and throughout England\". The satirical magazine \"Punch\" responded to the event by publishing a parody of Byron's poem \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\" including a wry commentary on Grace's contribution:\n\"The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold\",\n\"The Mary'bone Cracks for a trifle were bowled\";\n\"Our Grace before dinner was very soon done\",\n\"And Grace after dinner did not get a run\".\nNo one in England had taken the Australians very seriously at first, even though they had beaten Lillywhite's team in the inaugural Test match, and no one was too surprised when they lost their tour opener by an innings to the strong Nottinghamshire attack of Shaw and Morley on a rain-affected wicket. This perception of Australian cricketers was immediately and permanently revised such that \"henceforth a match between Australia and any representative English team would overshadow any of the 'great matches'\". Although the match did not mark the birth of international cricket, it was the point in time at which the English sporting public wholeheartedly embraced the concept. As Lord Hawke put it:\n\"(27 May 1878) this marked the commencement of the modern era of cricket\".\nAs for William Gilbert Grace, his whole approach to cricket was about what was needed to win the game in hand and he never took kindly to defeat. But, two decades later in his \"Reminiscences\", he gave the Australians due credit for their \"glorious victory\".\nJune: MCC v Derbyshire.\nA whole week passed before Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, starting with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl them out for a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to give him his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.\nDespite Grace's presence, this match attracted few spectators as it coincided with the Surrey v Australians match at The Oval, which drew very large crowds. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" commented that \"the Australians were attracting monster gatherings at The Oval on the days that this match was played, consequently very few visitors were at Lord's\".\nJune: North v South.\nThere were three North v South fixtures in June. The first two were played at Prince's Cricket Ground and Lord's with the South as the \"home\" team; the third took place at the end of the month at Trent Bridge as a home game for the North.\nThe match at Prince's began on Thursday, 6 June and was played over three days, ending in a draw after being impacted by the weather. The North won the toss and batted first, scoring 156 all out and 196–5. In their only innings, the South scored 197 all out. Grace opened the bowling for the South and took 4–73 and 2–59. Once more he failed with the bat and was caught and bowled for 4, again losing his wicket to the irrepressible Tom Emmett. The match raised about £100 for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society.\nThe match at Lord's was the following Monday, 10 June, and this time a full match could take place over three days. The North won by 3 wickets after scoring 180 and 226–7 in reply to the South's 202 and 203. Although his team lost, Grace could take consolation from his best batting performance of the season so far, and his first half-century, as he scored 45 and 77. He had 9 wickets in the match with 5–60 and 4–89. The match was played for the benefit of the Marylebone Professional Cricketers' Fund and drew an attendance of 10,858 on the first day, which was Whit Monday.\nGrace was directly involved in a controversial incident in this match when Dick Barlow was given out hit the ball twice. Barlow did something that is commonplace by knocking the ball away with his bat after he had \"dead-batted\" it (i.e., played a defensive stroke to stop the ball at his feet). The problem was that Barlow then \"dashed a couple of yards down the pitch and back again\" to tease the fielders and amuse the spectators. The joke backfired when Grace, fielding nearby, appealed on the grounds that Barlow had hit the ball twice and then \"attempted a run\". Barlow never had any intention of attempting a run but the Laws of cricket had to be observed and he was given out. It was just one in a catalogue of incidents that highlighted Grace's determination to \"win at all costs\".\nThe third match in the series began on Thursday, 27 June at Trent Bridge and the South won by 10 wickets after forcing the North to follow on. The South won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 204 with Grace contributing 12 before again being dismissed by Emmett. Grace took 9 wickets (6–46 and 3–64) as the North were bowled out for 116 and 136 to leave the South needing 49 to win. Grace did not bat in the second innings, allowing his elder brother E. M. Grace and Richard Humphrey to secure the 10 wicket victory. The match was played for the benefit of George Parr, who received about £250.\nThere was a fourth North v South match at The Oval in September but Grace did not play and the North won by an innings and 123 runs. In between the second and third North v South games, Grace played for the Gentlemen of England against the Australians at Prince's and then twice for Gloucestershire in away matches at The Oval against Surrey and Hove against Sussex.\nJune: Gentlemen v Australians and first Gloucestershire matches.\nGrace and his amateur colleagues took a measure of revenge at Prince's as they defeated the Australians by an innings and 1 run. The match began on Monday, 17 June and was completed within two days. The Australians won the toss and decided to bat, but were bowled out for only 75 with Grace and Allan Steel taking 4 wickets apiece. The Gentlemen scored 139 (Grace 25) and then dismissed the tourists for 63, Grace taking 2 wickets in support of Steel's 7–35.\nThe County Championship was a semi-official competition in 1878 as it was not formally structured until December 1890, but the age-old \"ad hoc\" claims on behalf of a \"Champion County\" had been regulated somewhat by the introduction of residential criteria for players in 1873. Gloucestershire, who had been recognised as the champions in 1877, were expected to be in contention for the title again as the county fixtures began in 1878.\nThe first match began under a cloud of Grace-inspired controversy on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though he would not have been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.\nJune: the Midwinter incident.\nGloucestershire arrived shorthanded at The Oval on 20 June. Their regular players present were the three Grace brothers, their cousin Walter Gilbert, wicket-keeper James Bush and batsmen James Cranston and Thomas Matthews. They also had the inexperienced William Woof, Carleton Haynes and Edward Wright, all of whom made their first-class debuts against Surrey. That was ten, so another player had to be found and Grace decided to take action.\nThe Australian Billy Midwinter had played for Gloucestershire in 1877 and, as luck or the fixture list would have it, he was at Lord's on 20 June to represent the Australians against Middlesex. Midwinter was at net practice when he saw W. G. and E. M. Grace, accompanied by James Bush, approaching. They argued that he was under contractual obligation to play for Gloucestershire if required and Grace demanded that he accompany them to The Oval at once. One source says that Midwinter was still under a contractual obligation to Gloucestershire and that the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked. Midwinter's reaction to Grace's demand is unknown but Tom Horan later wrote that Midwinter \"did not seem to know his own mind for two minutes together\". Whether he was in agreement or not, Midwinter did go to The Oval with the Graces. They were pursued by Conway, Gregory and Boyle who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders. In another account, the incident is dismissed as \"an amusing little quarrel\". The argument was serious enough and was fuelled by a long-standing \"antagonism\" between Grace and Conway which dated back to Grace's 1873 visit to Australia. At one point, Grace called the Australians \"a damned lot of sneaks\", though he later apologised in a letter to Gregory. In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire for the rest of the season, although he did not play for the county against the Australians in September, due to a hand injury.\nGrace may have felt pleased that he had got his man but he did not get his expenses, for Surrey refused to pay them. There was a subscript the following winter when Grace and his brother E. M. were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership and a special enquiry was ordered.\nJuly: Gentlemen v Players.\nThere were two Gentlemen v Players matches in 1878 and they took place consecutively in early July. The first was played at The Oval, starting on Thursday, 4 July, and the second at Lord's, starting on Monday, 8 July. A.N. Hornby captained the Gentlemen at The Oval and Grace at Lord's. The Gentlemen won both matches: by 55 runs at The Oval; and by 206 runs at Lord's.\nGrace's bad wicket batting skills were fully tested in the first innings at The Oval and he scored 40 in a total of only 76, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley taking five wickets each for the Players. The Players replied with 122 to take a first innings lead of 46. Grace took 2–37 in support of Allan Steel who claimed 6–60. The Gentlemen produced a much better batting performance on the Friday and scored 202, Grace again top-scoring with 63. He then took 3–30 as the Players were bowled out for 101, the match ending on Friday afternoon.\nUnder Grace's leadership at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted very well and totalled 310 on the first day before reducing the Players to 39–4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered on Tuesday morning, thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2–31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6–1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was well supported by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never in the hunt and, although Selby was defiant with another half-century, Grace took 4–55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory.\nJuly: USEE tour.\nMost of July was taken up with USEE matches which were Grace's \"bread and butter\" at the time. The team travelled to Melton Mowbray, Holbeck (near Leeds), Newcastle upon Tyne, Bolton and Birmingham to play odds games against local opposition.\nGrace took 21 wickets in the match against the 22 men of Melton Mowbray in a three-day match starting on Monday, 1 July. He scored 42 and 57 not out in his two innings, the match ending in a draw. Grace caught the evening train to be in London ready for the first Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, starting on Thursday, 4 July.\nThe next USEE match at Leeds Holbeck followed the second Gentlemen v Players fixture and began on Thursday, 11 July. The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole teetotaller in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted players in the USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off more than he could chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs.\nThe USEE had a scare against Eighteen of Bolton in the three-day match starting on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly behind on first innings. Grace and Southerton bowled the Bolton team out but the difference was a second innings of 63 by Charlwood in a total of just 120. Grace scored 51 and 22 and took 20 wickets. The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 behind on first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144–5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory.\nJuly/August: Gloucestershire's northern tour.\nGloucestershire made their first visit to Old Trafford Cricket Ground on Thursday, 25 July, to play Lancashire and this was the match immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem \"At Lord's\":\n\"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\"\n\"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\"\n\"For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,\"\n\"And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,\"\n\"And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host\"\n\"It's Glo'ster coming North, the irresistible,\"\n\"It's Gloucestershire up North, the irresistible,\"\n\"A Shire so young that has scarce impressed its traces,\"\n\"Ah, how shall it stand before all-resistless Graces?\"\n\"O, little red rose, their bats are as maces\"\n\"This day of seventy-eight they are come up north against thee\"\n\"The champion of the centuries, he cometh up against thee,\"\n\"The long-whiskered Doctor, that laugheth the rules to scorn,\"\n\"While the bowler, pitched against him, bans the day he was born;\"\n\"And G.F. with his science makes the fairest length forlorn;\"\n\"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\"\n\"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\"\n\"For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,\"\n\"And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,\"\n\"And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host\"\nGrace was not \"the long-whiskered Doctor\" for he was still unqualified in 1878: it was his elder brother E. M. (a coroner) \"that laugheth the rules to scorn\". Grace was of course \"the champion of the centuries\", although he had still not scored one in 1878. The opening (and closing) verse of the poem is the most famous stanza ever written about cricket and it eulogised two Lancashire players who were widely known as \"Monkey\" (AN Hornby) and \"Stonewaller\" (Dick Barlow).\nThe match was played over three days and culminated in a draw on Saturday, 27 July. Lancashire won the toss and decided to bat, but were dismissed for only 89 after rain shortened the first day's play. Grace took 3–44 and the left arm spinner Robert Miles took 7–38. Gloucestershire responded with 116, Grace making the top score of 32. At close of play on the second day, Lancashire had made 90–0 with Hornby on 68 and Barlow on 15; and the legend of the run stealers was born in the mind of the watching Francis Thompson. Hornby and Barlow put on 108 for the first wicket and then Barlow was out for 26. Hornby went on to score exactly 100 and Lancashire's total was 262 (Grace 1–65). Gloucestershire scored 125–5 in the last innings with Grace, batting at six, on 58 not out at the close.\nGloucestershire went over the Pennines to Sheffield and began the next game against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane on Monday, 29 July. Gloucestershire were soundly beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2–48 and 4–128. They were undone by the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, including 7–38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings. The match was played for the benefit of Tom Emmett, who received £616 13s 1d.\nThe final leg of Gloucestershire's northern tour was at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, to Saturday, 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (Grace 9) and 253 (Grace 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (Grace 2–91) and 10 for 1 (Grace (1–2). So Grace finally made his first (and only) century of the 1878 season, surprisingly against arguably the strongest bowling attack in the country.\nAugust: Canterbury Cricket Week.\nThe 1878 Canterbury Festival consisted of two first-class matches played between Monday, 5 August and Friday, 9 August. at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. The first match, between Thirteen of Kent and an England XI, finished early on the Wednesday. The second match, between Twelve of Kent and Twelve of MCC, began later the same afternoon and finished on Friday afternoon. Grace played in both games, representing England and MCC. The Kent XIII won the match against England by 8 wickets. Grace scored 21 and 14; with the ball, he took 5–72 and 1–21. Kent defeated MCC in the twelves game by 9 wickets after Grace was out for 0 and 1. He took 4–82 in Kent's first innings total of 216 but did not bowl in the second innings when Kent needed just 20 to win.\nAugust/September: Gloucestershire at home.\nFrom Monday, 12 August to Friday, 6 September, Grace was entirely involved with Gloucestershire who played seven matches in less than four weeks. Six of these were at home and one, against an England XI, was at The Oval. Gloucestershire played its home games at the College Ground, Cheltenham and at the Clifton College Close Ground.\nGloucestershire's return game against Nottinghamshire began on Monday, 12 August, at Clifton College. Gloucestershire won a low-scoring match by 109 runs after batting first. They totalled 127 (Grace 26) and 137 (Grace 6) which were modest scores, but Nottinghamshire's replies amounted only to 84 and 71. Grace produced another fine bowling performance with figures of 5–29 and 6–35 against one of the strongest batting sides in England. Alfred Shaw was unable to play for Nottinghamshire.\nIn a three-day match starting on Thursday, 15 August, the England XI defeated Gloucestershire at The Oval by 6 wickets after Grace had won the toss for his county and decided to bat. They scored 118 (Grace 25) and England replied with 163 (Grace 3–67). Rain prevented play for most of the Friday and Gloucestershire in their second innings had reached 27–1 at the end of the day. On the Saturday, England bowled them out for 118 (Grace 29) with Tom Emmett taking 8–51 (12–93 in the match). Grace took 3–39 in England's second innings as they made 7–44 to win by six wickets. Midwinter suffered a hand injury in the field when he attempted to stop a powerful drive played by George Ulyett; he was unable to play again in 1878.\nThe Cheltenham Festival took place the following week with two matches on the College Ground: against Sussex starting on Monday, 19 August; and a return against Yorkshire starting on Thursday, 22 August. Gloucestershire made short work of Sussex, winning by an innings and 24 runs in less than two days. Grace made only 2 of Gloucestershire's total of 198 but he was again outstanding with the ball and took 13 wickets in the match (6–18 and 7–88). The Yorkshire match was drawn after being ruined by the weather. Yorkshire had claimed a first innings lead after Grace was yet again dismissed by Tom Emmett, this time for 10, but he compensated by having taken 6–77 to restrict the Yorkshire lead to 39. He captured a further two wickets in the second innings before the match was washed out.\nOn Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire again at the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star performer as he took 7–77 and 5–32, but this time he did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.\nA return match against Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were fortunate to get a draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again came to the rescue with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in his shirt and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.\nCounty Championship.\nGloucestershire played 10 matches against the other first-class county clubs and ended with a record of 4 wins, 4 draws and 2 defeats. This was not good enough for them to retain the title they had claimed in 1877, when they had won 7 and drew 1 of 8 matches played. The main claimant was unbeaten Middlesex but they had only played 6 matches and Roy Webber, deploying a \"rationalisation\" method based on a points system used by the official competition in the 20th century, argued that Nottinghamshire was the champion county in 1878.\nSeptember: Gloucestershire v Australians.\nOn Thursday, 5 September, the Australians arrived at Clifton for what promised to be an explosive encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who really did have a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It was the first time Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.\nSeptember: Essex v USEE.\nGrace's final appearance in 1878 was for the USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played for the benefit of the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.\nThe expenses inquiry.\nIt was in November 1878 that MCC defined amateur status. Their dictum was that \"a gentleman ought not to make any profit from playing cricket\". This was carefully worded so that an amateur was allowed to claim reasonable expenses, but controversy persisted about what were \"reasonable expenses\" and what were actually \"fees\". Fred Grace fell foul of this by claiming a fee for representing the USEE and was subsequently banned from representing the Gentlemen in matches at Lord's. W. G. Grace got around his USEE fee by having it classed as a salary for his work in organising the matches.\nThe controversy rumbled on and there was a long debate in the press through the winter of 1878–79 about the various payments received by the \"amateurs\" of Gloucestershire. The enquiry at Gloucestershire CCC took place in January 1879. W. G. and E. M. Grace were forced to answer charges that they had claimed \"exorbitant expenses\", one of the few times that their money-making activity was seriously challenged. The claim had been submitted to Surrey re the controversial 1878 match in which Billy Midwinter was brought in as a late replacement, but Surrey refused to pay it and this provoked the enquiry. The Graces managed to survive \"a protracted and stormy meeting\" with E. M. retaining his key post as club secretary, although he was forced to liaise in future with a new finance committee and abide by stricter rules. The incident served to highlight an ongoing issue about the nominal amateur status of the Grace brothers. Like all amateur players, they claimed expenses for travel and accommodation to and from cricket matches, but there is plenty of evidence that the Graces made rather more money by playing than their basic expenses would allow and W. G. in particular \"made more than any professional\".\nThe national testimonial voted for Grace by MCC was realised six months later in the form of a presentation to him by Lord Fitzhardinge at Lord's on 22 July 1879 in the form of a marble clock, two bronze ornaments and a cheque for £1,458.\nSeason summary.\nDespite his troubles in 1878, it was another good season for Grace on the field as he completed a sixth successive double with 1,151 runs and 153 wickets. He made 24 first-class appearances, scoring 1,151 runs with a highest score of 116 at an average of 28.77. He completed one century and five half-centuries. In the field, he held 42 catches and took 153 wickets with a best analysis of 8–23. His bowling average was 14.43; he took five wickets in an innings 13 times and ten wickets in a match six times.\nGrace was seventh in the overall national batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace was one of only two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.\nGrace's bowling average of 14.50 left him eighth among bowlers who took 100 wickets, the best of whom was Allan Steel with 164 wickets at 9.43. Grace's 153 wickets was the fourth highest tally behind Alfred Shaw (201), Fred Morley (197) and Allan Steel (164).\nGrace had an outstanding season as a fielder, holding 42 catches in just 24 appearances. His tally was higher than anyone else including wicket-keepers. The second highest was Alfred Shaw with 32 catches in 30 appearances. The best performance by a wicket-keeper was Ted Pooley of Surrey who held 25 catches and completed 31 stumpings.\nFootnote.\n• a) As described in Grace's first-class career statistics, there are different versions of his first-class career totals as a result of disagreement among cricket statisticians about the status of some matches he played in. Note that this is a statistical issue only and has little, if any, bearing on the historical aspects of Grace's career. In the infobox, the \"traditional\" first-class figures from \"Wisden 1916\" (as reproduced by Rae, pp. 495–496), are given first and the \"amended\" figures from \"CricketArchive\" follow in parentheses. There is no dispute about Grace's Test career record and those statistics are universally recognised. See Variations in first-class cricket statistics for more information."

        "text": "The Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball team represents Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky, United States. The school's athletic program began a transition to NCAA Division I in the 2012–13 school year. For the first three seasons of the transition (through 2014–15), it was a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference. In the final season of the transition in 2015–16, the Norse joined the Horizon League. The Norse were coached by John Brannen until April 14, 2019, when he left to take a job with the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. Before him the Norse program's coach was Dave Bezold, who had an overall record of 138 wins and 72 losses.\nOn April 23, 2019 Darrin Horn was hired as head coach by Northern Kentucky. Since joining Division I in 2012–13, the Norse have made three NCAA tournament appearances, most recently in 2023.\nHistory.\nThe program began in 1971, then known as Northern Kentucky State College, played out of Newport High School's gymnasium. The team played its first game on November 12, 1971, against Calvary Bible College; winning 109–65.\nOver the past 15 years, NKU became one of the country's premier NCAA Division II college basketball programs. The Norse won three Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) tournament championships in 1994–95, 2002–03, and 2008–09; and GLVC East Division regular season champion in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09. In NCAA postseason play, NKU made 12 NCAA DII postseason appearances, including back-to-back appearances in the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship in the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons.\nOn December 8, 2011, NKU officially announced it accepted an invitation to join the Atlantic Sun Conference (now known as the ASUN Conference) and begin a multi-year transition to Division I beginning in 2012. The Norse began a full ASUN and Division I schedule in the 2012–13 season, however the university was not eligible for NCAA D-I postseason competition until becoming a full Division I member in 2016.\nThe team's 2013–14 season schedule featured 3 marquee games against Purdue, Kentucky, and North Carolina. This was also the first season in which the team hosted Division I non-conference home games.\nIn their first season of eligibility, the Norse qualified for the 2017 NCAA tournament.

The open-water competition took place from 9 to 10 August in Hyde Park.\nSwimming featured 34 events (17 male, 17 female), including two 10 km open-water marathons in Hyde Park's Serpentine Lake. The remaining 32 were contested in a 50 m long course pool within the Olympic Park.\nThe United States claimed a total of 31 medals (16 golds, 9 silver, and 6 bronze) in the leaderboard to maintain its supremacy as the most successful nation in swimming. Brought by an unprecedented sporting domination, Michael Phelps emerged as the most decorated Olympian of all time after winning six more medals at these Games to bring his total after the 2012 games to 22 (18 golds, 2 silver, and 2 bronze). Battling against the Americans for an overall medal count, China mounted to an unexpected second-place effort on the leaderboard with a tally of 10 medals (five golds, three silver, and bronze) after striking a superb double from Sun Yang in long-distance freestyle (both 400 and 1500 m) and Ye Shiwen in the individual medley (both 200 and 400 m). Meanwhile, France ended on a spectacular fashion in third spot with a total of seven medals (four golds, two silver, and one bronze), followed by the Netherlands with four, including two golds from Ranomi Kromowidjojo in sprint freestyle (both 50 and 100 m), and South Africa with three.\nFor the first time since 1992, Australia delivered an underwhelming performance with only a single triumph in the freestyle relay, but managed to bring home a total of ten medals. After not winning a gold in swimming since 2000, Japan produced the most medals in the post-war era to build a tally of eleven (three silver and eight bronze).\nA total of nine world records and twenty five Olympic records were set during the competition.\nEvents.\nSimilar to the program's format in 2008, swimming featured a total of 34 events (17 each for men and women) including two 10 km open-water marathons. The following events were contested (all pool events were long course, and distances are in metres unless stated):\nSchedule.\nSimilar to the previous Olympics since 2000, with the exception of 2008, swimming program schedule occurred in two segments.

Each country is allowed to enter up to two swimmers per individual event (provided they qualify), and one entry per relay; and a country may not have more than 26 males and 26 females (52 total) on its team.\nSwimming – individual events.\nOn 11 November 2010, FINA posted the qualifying times for individual events for the 2012 Olympics. The time standards consist of two time standards, an \"Olympic \"Qualifying\" Time\" and an \"Olympic \"invitation\" time\". Each country was able to enter up to two swimmers per event, provided both swimmers met the (faster) \"qualifying\" time. A country was able to enter one swimmer per event that met the \"invitation\" standard. Any swimmer who met the \"qualifying\" time was entered in the event for the Games; a swimmer meeting the \"invitation\" standard was eligible for entry, and their entry was allotted/filled in by ranking.\nIf a country has no swimmers meeting either qualifying standard, it may enter one male and one female. A country that does not receive an allocation spot but has at least one swimmer who meets a qualifying standard may enter the swimmer with the highest ranking.\nSwimming – relay events.\nEach relay event featured 16 teams, composed of:\nOpen-water swimming.\nThe men's and women's 10 km races at the 2012 Olympics each featured 25 swimmers:\nParticipating nations.\nFINA announced in early July 2012 that 631 athletes from 166 nations would compete in swimming events at the 2012 Olympics (note: all nations qualified for the 10 km races also had at least 1 swimmer qualified for the pool portion). 59 nations qualified via the A cut (OQT), 12 via the B cut (OST) and 95 via Universality. Brunei, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Togo, and Tonga made their official debut in swimming. Meanwhile, Grenada, Iraq, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines returned to the sport after an eight-year absence. Nations with swimmers at the Games are (team size in parentheses):\nMedal table.\nNote: \"There were ties for silver in the men's 200 m freestyle and men's 100 m butterfly events.\"\nOlympic and world records broken.\nWomen.\nDerya Büyükuncu and Lars Frölander were the first swimmers to participate in six consecutive Olympic Games (1992-2012).\nControversies.\nIn the women's 400-metre individual medley, Chinese Ye Shiwen won in a world-record time of 4:28.43. After the race, Ye had allegations against her suggesting the use of drugs that drew comment from the International Olympic Committee and FINA who defended Ye. Ye has never tested positive of any performance-enhancing drugs. Some claim the accusations were a result of xenophobia towards the Chinese.\nIn the final of the 100-metre breaststroke, South African Cameron van der Burgh won in a world-record time of 58.46, bettering the previous record of 58.58 held by Brenton Rickard of Australia. After the race however, underwater camera footage showed winner van der Burgh did three illegal butterfly kicks on the underwater pullout (rules allow for one kick). Van der Burgh later admitted to the illegal move and justified the act by saying if he was not doing it, \"you are falling behind or giving yourself a disadvantage.\"\nGallery of the medalists.\nSome of the Olympic medalists in London:"

        "text": "Pierce Devon \"Percy\" Coleman (October 10, 1876 – February 16, 1948) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played parts of two Major League seasons.\nEarly life.\nColeman was born in Mason, Ohio, the first of three children of Irish-American parents, William P. Coleman, a farmer, and Florence A. (McVay) Coleman on Oct. 15, 1876. He attended Mason High School and graduated in 1894.\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Army July 18, 1898 as a private with the 6th Infantry Company G during the Spanish–American War. He was honorably discharged from Fort Sam Houston, Texas in January 1899.\nProfessional baseball career.\nColeman pitched in the National League in 13 games in 1897 for the St. Louis Browns at age 20, and one game in 1898 for the Cincinnati Reds. He made his MLB debut on July 2, 1897, when he came on in relief in the sixth inning of a 13-1 Browns loss on the road vs. the Cleveland Spiders, allowing 4 runs in 4 innings.\nHis final game was on October 1, 1898; the Cincinnati Enquirer story reported \"Coleman pitched fairly good ball\" with 6 innings giving up just one run before tiring in the seventh in a 7-3 complete-game loss to St. Louis.\nHis overall MLB record was 1–3 with a 6.69 earned run average. In 37 official plate appearances, he had seven hits for a .226 batting average.\nAfter his big-league career ended, he compiled a record of 22–18 in three seasons (1898–1900) in the minor leagues in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Savannah, Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama, San Antonio, Texas and Portsmouth, Virginia.\nBy far his best season was 1899 at age 22 for the San Antonio Bronchos in the Class C Texas League as he led the team in wins with a 13–8 record, starting 21 games and completing 20 with 183 innings pitched. He also played 45 games in the outfield and 5 at first base, batting .338 with 100 hits in 296 plate appearances. On July 10, 1899, Coleman \"of the defunct San Antonio ball team accepted an offer from the Buffalo team of the Western league at $150 per month.\"\nThe following year, 1900, was his last in pro baseball as he went 6–4 with a 1.05 ERA for the Portsmouth Boers of the Class D Virginia League. He batted .211 in 57 at-bats.\nPersonal life.\nColeman was married to Grace (Slayback) and they later lived in Cincinnati. They eventually moved to California as their daughter, Majel Coleman, pursued an acting career. She appeared in 11 feature films between 1923 and 1934 and also was a model. A 1922 newspaper article stated that, on Majel's 19th birthday, she \"received an instrument of destruction this week in the shape of a snappy speedster (car) from her father, P.D. Coleman, southwestern representative of a large eastern paint concern.\"\nIn 1910 the Colemans were residing in Kokomo, Indiana and his occupation was \"commercial salesman\" for RedSeal Paint. His World War I draft registration stated that he was a traveling salesman for the Sherwin-Williams Co. based in Cincinnati.\nColeman and his wife and daughter resided in Los Angeles as of 1930. Percy Coleman died at age 71 in 1948 in Van Nuys, California and is buried in Los Angeles National Cemetery. In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the Mason Athletic Hall of Fame."

        "title": "2012 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2012 proceeded according to rules most recently revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 9, 2012. The Golden Era Committee, the second of three new era committees established by the July 2010 rules change, replacing the Veterans Committee, convened early in December 2011 to select from a Golden Era ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport between 1947 and 1972, called the \"Golden Era\" by the Hall of Fame.\nThe induction class consisted of Ron Santo, elected by the Golden Era Committee, and Barry Larkin, elected by the BBWAA.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 22, 2012, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. On July 21, the Hall presented two awards for media excellence—its own Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA ballot was announced on November 30, 2011. The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1992 or later, but not after 2006; the ballot included candidates from the 2011 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last playing appearance was in 2006. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nThe ballot consisted of the 14 candidates who received at least 5% of the vote in the 2011 election, plus 13 first-time candidates. Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates. Under BBWAA rules, write-in votes were not permitted.\nResults of the 2011 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 9, 2012. A total of 573 ballots were cast (including nine ballots which supported no candidates), with 430 votes required for election. A total of 2,921 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.10 per ballot - the lowest rate ever, breaking the record of 5.32 set in 1997. Any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be inducted. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (). The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates selected in subsequent elections, if any, will be indicated in \"italics\".\nThe newly eligible candidates included 20 All-Stars, 9 of whom were not on the ballot, representing a total of 33 All-Star selections. Bernie Williams was the only candidate selected to at least five All-Star Games; he was selected exactly five times. The new field of candidates featured a pair of four-time Gold-Glove winners (Williams in center, Mike Matheny at catcher) and a pair of Rookie-of-the-Year Award winners (Todd Hollandsworth and Tim Salmon), neither of whom was ever selected for an All-Star Game.\nThe biggest issue surrounding this election, as in elections in the recent past, was the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). During the 2012 voting, debate about the influence of steroids on the game in the 1990s was widely believed to have affected the vote totals for several power hitters on the ballot, including McGwire, Bagwell, Walker, Palmeiro, and González, regardless of whether they had ever tested positive for steroid use or had even been accused of involvement with steroids. Of these players:\nThe field of potential new candidates was considered to be weaker than it was in 2011. The most prominent new candidates included Bernie Williams, Rubén Sierra, Vinny Castilla, Eric Young, Tim Salmon, and Brad Radke. Williams was the only new candidate who received enough votes to remain on the ballot in 2013.\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Manny Alexander, Edgardo Alfonzo, Pedro Astacio, David Bell, Giovanni Carrara, Mike DeJean, Einar Díaz, Joey Eischen, Scott Erickson, Carl Everett, Jeff Fassero, Alex Gonzalez, Danny Graves, Todd Greene, Jason Grimsley, Chris Hammond, Rick Helling, Dustin Hermanson, Jose Hernandez, Todd Hollandsworth, Damian Jackson, Kevin Jarvis, Steve Karsay, Tim Laker, Matt Lawton, Eli Marrero, Mike Matheny, Quinton McCracken, Dan Miceli, Jeff Nelson, Eduardo Pérez, Todd Pratt, Curtis Pride, Joe Randa, Mike Remlinger, Félix Rodríguez, Michael Tucker, José Vizcaíno, Chris Widger, Tim Worrell and Esteban Yan. José Lima last played in 2006, but was eligible for consideration in 2011 due to his death on May 23, 2010.\n\"ESPN.com\" columnist Jim Caple noted several days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections:\nGolden Era Committee.\nIn keeping with the restructured Hall of Fame voting procedure, the existing BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee identified 10 Golden Era candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions between 1947 and 1972. Along with the 1947–1972 era, these rules defined the consideration set:\nHistorical Overview Committee (11 BBWAA members): Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"); Ken Nigro (formerly \"The Baltimore Sun\"); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Glenn Schwarz (formerly \"San Francisco Chronicle\"); Claire Smith (ESPN); Tracy Ringolsby (FSN Rocky Mountain); and Mark Whicker (\"Orange County Register\").\nThe Golden Era Ballot for election by the Golden Era Committee on December 5 was released on November 3, 2011, and the Hall of Fame announced the results on December 5, 2011.\nKaat, Miñoso, Oliva, and Tiant were living when the ballot was announced.\nGolden Era Committee (16-member committee appointed by the Hall's board of directors) was announced at the same time as the Golden Era ballot:\nThe Committee convened at the 2011 winter meetings on December 5, 2011, with the standard 75% or 12 of 16 votes required for election and July 22, 2012, induction.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three nominees for the 2012 award were selected by a three-person BBWAA committee and announced at the BBWAA's annual All-Star Game meeting on July 12, 2011, at Chase Field in Phoenix. They were Bob Elliott of the \"Toronto Sun\"; Paul Hagen, then of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\"; and Russell Schneider, formerly of \"The Plain Dealer\" of Cleveland. This was the fourth consecutive year Elliott had been nominated.\nUnder BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2011 World Series or at the 2011 winter meetings. The winner of the 2012 J. G. Taylor Spink Award, announced at the winter meetings, was Bob Elliott, who received 205 votes from the 455 ballots cast. Hagen received 169 votes and Schneider 61. Elliott became the first Canadian recipient of the award.\nThis is Elliott's second award for writing excellence from a major baseball hall of fame. He was the 2010 recipient of the Jack Graney Award, given irregularly for excellence in either writing or broadcasting, from the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now presented at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. The recipient was announced during the 2011 winter meetings, following a vote by the same committee that selected seven of the finalists (below).\nTen finalists were announced on October 5, 2011. In accord with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists. Three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting in September 2011 at the Hall's Facebook page.\nFive candidates were living when the ballot was announced—the active McCarver, Nadel, and Shannon; and the retired Cárdenas and Doucet.\nOn December 7, Tim McCarver, the lead analyst for \"Major League Baseball on Fox\" since , was named as the recipient. A catcher in MLB for 22 years, mostly with the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies, he joined the Phillies' local television broadcast team almost immediately after his first retirement as a player in 1979 (he would briefly return as a player late in the 1980 season). From there, he went on to the New York Mets' local broadcast team before moving to national network television. McCarver has been an analyst for all four of the major U.S. over-the-air broadcast networks during his career.\nMcCarver became the second Frick Award winner, after recipient Tony Kubek, whose broadcasting career was exclusively in television."

        "text": "Joseph Cullen (born 13 July 1989) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events. He won three Youth Tour tournaments in his early career and has qualified for the PDC World Championship twelve times, winning only thrice in the first round. Cullen reached his first major quarter-final at the 2016 UK Open and won his first PDC Pro Tour title in 2017. He won his first televised title at the 2022 Masters.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nCullen first came to prominence in 2008 when he qualified for the UK Open. He defeated Mark Stapleton and Dennis Smith before Chris Mason defeated him in the last 64. Following his performances at Bolton, he joined the PDC circuit. He also reached the final of the New Kids on the Oche tournament, losing to Arron Monk.\nIn 2009, Cullen decided to leave his job as a postman to concentrate on a career in darts.\nCullen had another decent run at the 2010 UK Open. He knocked out Darren Latham and Mike Nott before losing to Mervyn King, again in the last 64. Later that year, he defeated Phil Taylor in the last 16 of the John McEvoy Gold Dart Classic in Killarney, eventually losing in the quarter-finals to Colin Osborne.\nCullen qualified for his first PDC World Darts Championship in 2011. He lost narrowly to Terry Jenkins by 3 sets to 2 in the first round. In April, Cullen reached his first PDC Pro Tour final at the sixth UK Open Qualifier in Barnsley, losing 6–1 to Taylor.\n2012.\nHe reached the final of the PDPA World Championship Qualifier, where he was beaten 5–3 by Arron Monk. The result meant that he qualified for the preliminary round of the 2012 World Championship, where he beat Oliver Ferenc of Serbia by 4 legs to 2. He played number 10 seed Terry Jenkins in the first round for the second successive year and was beaten 3–0, winning just three legs in the match. In April, he earned a place in the Austrian Darts Open by defeating Sam Hill and John Bowles in the UK qualifier. He played Brendan Dolan in the first round and won 6–4, and then continued his run by beating Simon Whitlock 6–4, despite his opponent hitting a nine darter. Cullen defeated Mark Walsh to make the quarter-finals, where he was this time on the wrong end of a 6–4 scoreline as he lost to eventual winner Justin Pipe. Cullen's best result of the season came a week after this as he won through to the semi-finals of the final UK Open Qualifier, but was then whitewashed 6–0 by Pipe. He also qualified for the third European Tour event, the European Darts Open and beat Jenkins 6–1 in the first round in Düsseldorf, before losing to Johnny Haines 6–5 in round two.\nCullen reached the last 16 of the UK Open with victories over Jim Walker (9–4) and Colin Lloyd (9–8), but then let a 4–0 and 5–1 lead against Jamie Caven slip to lose 9–8. He qualified for the World Matchplay for the first time and lost to Pipe 10–4 in the first round.\n2013.\nCullen qualified for the 2013 World Championship by finishing 36th on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, claiming the fifth of sixteen spots that were available for the highest non-qualified players. He lost 3–0 to John Part in the first round, with the Canadian's superior finishing being the difference between the players. Cullen was ranked world number 41 after the tournament. He lost 9–5 to Lee Palfreyman in the third round of the UK Open. At the Austrian Darts Open Cullen beat Kim Huybrechts 6–4 and then averaged a stunning 111.84 average in seeing off Stuart Kellett 6–1. He reached the quarter-finals of this event for the second year running by surviving one match dart from Raymond van Barneveld to win 6–5, but was then beaten 6–0 by Mervyn King. Cullen reached three other quarter-finals in floor events during the year but lost in each one.\n2014.\nCullen qualified for the 2014 World Championship through the ProTour Order of Merit once again and faced Peter Wright in the first round. Cullen took out a 147 finish to level the opening set with Wright on 12 but lost the decider and also lost the final leg in the second set and was beaten 3–0. He missed out on playing in the UK Open for the first time in his career as he failed to advance beyond the last 128 in any of the six qualifiers. At the 11th Players Championship of the year he reached the semi-finals of a ranking PDC event for the first in over two years, where he was defeated 6–3 by Gary Anderson. Cullen won through to the same stage of the 16th event with impressive victories over Dave Chisnall, Andy Hamilton and Michael van Gerwen, but this time lost 6–3 to Brendan Dolan.\n2015.\nCullen lost 3–1 to reigning champion Michael van Gerwen in the first round of the 2015 World Championship, after every set had gone to a deciding leg which included Cullen missing two darts for the second set. He was knocked out in the third round of the UK Open 9–6 by Eddie Dootson. Cullen lost in the quarter-finals of the first Players Championship 6–0 to Dave Chisnall and had to wait until October for another one. It came at the European Darts Grand Prix after he saw off Antonio Alcinas 6–3, Chisnall 6–2 (with an average of 103.58) and then averaged an outstanding 110.16 in defeating Raymond van Barneveld 6–2. However, in the quarters he averaged just over 20 points less during a 6–4 loss to Mensur Suljović. Cullen's third and final quarter-final of 2015 was at the 19th Players Championship after he ousted Ronnie Baxter, Ian White, Jamie Caven and Steve West, before losing 6–4 to Stephen Bunting.\n2016.\nHe took the final qualifying spot from the Pro Tour Order of Merit for the 2016 World Championship, but lost in the opening round for the sixth year in a row as he won just two legs during a 3–0 defeat to Jelle Klaasen. At the UK Open Cullen beat Mark Frost 9–1, Alan Norris 9–6 and Stephen Bunting 9–7 to play in his first major quarter-final. He produced a fightback from 9–3 down to Peter Wright, but would lose 10–7 with an average of 101.83, his highest in a televised match to date. This began a rich vein in form for Cullen as he reached the semi-finals of the first Players Championship event (lost 6–3 to Wright) and the same stage of the German Darts Masters (lost 6–1 to Michael van Gerwen after whitewashing reigning world champion Gary Anderson 6–0 in the quarters).\nCullen's second ever PDC final came at the ninth Players Championship, but he was thrashed 6–0 by Benito van de Pas. Another came at the 11th event and he was left waiting for his first professional title as Ian White won 6–3. Cullen qualified for the World Matchplay for the first time in four years and lost 10–5 to Wright in the opening round. Cullen made his debut at the World Grand Prix and he won the first set against Simon Whitlock, before losing six of the next seven legs to bow out. After seeing off Chris Dobey 6–2 at the European Championship he was heavily beaten 10–3 by Phil Taylor in the second round. A 13 dart leg from Cullen saw him squeeze past Anderson in to the quarter-finals of the non-ranking World Series of Darts Finals, where he lost to Wright in a televised match for the third time in 2016, this time 10–7. Cullen eased past Steve Brown 6–1 and Rowby-John Rodriguez 6–0 at the Players Championship Finals, but then averaged 71.13 as Raymond van Barneveld knocked him out 10–2 in the third round.\n2017.\nAfter breaking into the top 32 on the Order of Merit during 2016, it meant Cullen was a seeded player at the World Championship for the first time in his career. He beat Corey Cadby 3–1 in the first round to pick up his first-ever win at the tournament at the seventh time of asking. Cullen averaged 100.88, but went on to lose 4–0 to two-time winner of the event Adrian Lewis in the next round.\nCullen joined the Professional Dart Players Association's 9 Dart Club for the first time, after getting a nine-dart finish in the second round of the 2017 PDC Players Championship 4 against Jim Brown.\nCullen claimed his first PDC title in April at the eighth Players Championship. He was 4–1 up in the final, before Daryl Gurney squared the match at 5–5. Gurney missed one match dart and Cullen won on double four and said afterwards that he had relied on his natural talent in the past, but in the last year he had also been working very hard on his game.\n2022.\nEntering the 2022 PDC World Darts Championship ranked 13th in the world, Cullen defeated Jim Williams 3–2 in the second round before losing 3–4 to debutant Martijn Kleermaker in the third round. On 30 January 2022, Cullen won a first televised PDC title when he won the 2022 Masters. Cullen defeated Daryl Gurney, Gary Anderson 10–1 with an average of 106.30, Michael van Gerwen and José de Sousa en route to the final. Despite missing ten match darts, he defeated Dave Chisnall 11–9 to secure his first televised PDC title.\nCullen joined the Professional Dart Players Association's 9 Dart Club for the second time, after getting a nine-dart finish in the third round of the 2022 PDC Players Championship 5 against James Wilson.\nCullen competed in his debut season in the Premier League in 2022; he finished 4th in the table and qualified for finals night on the last night of league play, by defeating Peter Wright in his final match. On June 13, at finals night in Berlin, Cullen defeated Jonny Clayton 10-4 in the semi-finals to secure a place in the final against Michael van Gerwen, which he lost 11-10 after missing a match dart.\nCullen made it to the last 16 of the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship. He was knocked out by the eventual winner Michael Smith.\nPerformance timeline.\nPDC European Tour"

        "title": "Washington State Cougars baseball",
        "text": "The Washington State Cougars baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Washington State University, located in Pullman, Washington. The Cougars' home venue is Bailey–Brayton Field, first opened for the 1980 season and located on the university's campus.\nThe program has been a baseball member of the Pac-12 Conference in NCAA Division I since the start of the 1960 season, following the dissolution of the Pacific Coast Conference. Through 2014, the Cougars have appeared in four College World Series and 16 NCAA tournaments. In conference postseason play, WSU has won one Northwest Conference Tournament, one Pacific Coast Conference Northern Division Tournament, one Pacific-8 Conference North Division Tournament, and four Pacific-10 Conference Northern Division Tournaments. In regular season play, the program has won five Northwest Conference Championships, 12 Pacific Coast Conference Northern Division titles, four AAWU Championships, nine Pac-8 North Division titles, and 11 Pac-10 North Division titles. As of the start of the 2013 Major League Baseball season, 32 former Cougars have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nIn 2024, Washington State baseball will become an associate member of the Mountain West Conference, following the dissolution of the Pac-12.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first season of organized baseball at the school was in 1892, shortly after the school's founding. In that season, the team had an 11–1 record; its first game was a 26–0 victory over Pullman Military College on March 12. After a three-year hiatus from 1893–1895, the team returned for one season in 1896. After another break in 1897, baseball at Washington State returned permanently in 1898. Previously led by team captains, H.E. Lougheed was named its first head coach for the 1901 season. Through the end of the 1909 season, the program competed as an independent and compiled a 110–59–1 () record.\nWashington State joined the Northwest Conference in 1910; prior to the 1912–1913 academic year, former head football coach John R. Bender returned to Pullman from Saint Louis University. He also served as the school's head baseball coach beginning with the 1913 season, in which the team won its first Northwest Conference title and finished at 7–1. The team won the conference title in 1914 and 1915, along with the conference tournament in 1915.\nAfter the 1915 season, Bender left to coach football at Kansas State and was replaced by Fred Bohler, who led the team to Northwest Conference titles in 1916 and 1918. Following the 1918 season, the program joined the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), which had been formed in December 1915. In its first season in the PCC, the team finished fourth in 1919.\nIn 1919, the college adopted the Cougar as its athletic programs' official nickname.\nBuck Bailey era.\nIn the summer of 1926, thirty-year-old Buck Bailey came to Pullman as an assistant football coach and head baseball coach. Born and raised in central Texas, Bailey played baseball and football at Texas A&amp;M and served in the U.S. Army during the First World War. In his first season as head coach in 1927, the Cougar nine finished first in the PCC North Division and won the PCC Tournament. The team also won the North Division title in 1933, 1936, and 1938.\nIn 1932, Art McLarney debuted for the New York Giants on August 23 and became the program's first alumnus to play in the major leagues.\nIn February 1943, Bailey joined the U.S. Navy during World War II. The \"Eugene Register-Guard\" article that announced Bailey's departure referred to him as an \"athletic comedian,\" and other sources attest that Bailey had a colorful coaching style. For three seasons, 1943–1945, basketball coach Jack Friel coached the program.\nBailey returned prior to the start of 1946 season and resumed his coaching duties. From 1947–1950, the program won four consecutive PCC North Division titles. This run culminated in the program's first College World Series appearance in 1950, the first College World Series played at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. To qualify, the Cougars defeated Stanford to win the PCC Tournament. At the World Series, WSC opened with three consecutive wins over Tufts, Alabama, and Rutgers, but lost 12–1 to defending champion Texas, who had lost their opener in the double-elimination tournament. The last two teams remaining and both with one loss, the Cougars and Longhorns met again three days later in the national championship game, which Texas won 3–0. Future major leaguers Ted Tappe and Gene Conley played on the 1950 team.\nThe program reached the College World Series again under Bailey in 1956. To qualify from District VIII, the team defeated USC in the PCC Tournament. At the CWS in Omaha, the Cougars were eliminated without a win after consecutive defeats to Bradley and New Hampshire, and tied for seventh place with NYU.\nAfter the 1959 baseball season, the PCC dissolved on July 1 following a scandal involving illegal payments to football players at several of its schools. In reaction, five former PCC members, formed the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), which Washington State's baseball program joined when play began in the 1960 season. Later renamed the Pac-8, it became the Pac-10 in 1978 and the Pac-12 in 2011.\nThe program qualified for the NCAA tournament in each of its first two seasons in the AAWU. In both 1960 and 1961, the Cougars were eliminated by USC in Los Angeles in the District VIII Regional.\nThree years after his retirement, Bailey and his wife Frances were killed in an automobile collision in New Mexico in October 1964.\nBobo Brayton era.\nFollowing Buck Bailey's retirement at the end of the 1961 season, the school hired Bobo Brayton, a former Washington State player and head baseball coach at Yakima Valley Junior College for a decade. In Brayton's first three seasons, WSU failed to qualify for the postseason, but won the AAWU North Division in 1965 and qualified for the NCAA tournament. In the second round of the District VIII Regional, the Cougars defeated Stanford and advanced to the College World Series in Omaha. WSU finished third, with wins over Texas and Connecticut, and two losses to Ohio State. The second loss to Ohio State was 1–0 in 15 innings, a complete game by Buckeye starter Steve Arlin, who recorded twenty strikeouts and gave up just three hits.\nIn 1966, WSU again qualified for the NCAA tournament but was eliminated by USC in the District VIII Regional finals. Following the season, future major leaguer Danny Frisella was selected by the New York Mets in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft. Following the 1968 season, two future major leaguers, Rick Austin and Ron Cey, signed professional contracts.\nAfter missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons from 1967–1969, the Cougars won the Pac-8 North Division title and qualified for the Pac-8 Tournament in 1970. This division title started a streak of 11 consecutive North Division titles (1970–1981) and 19 of the 22 from 1970–1991. In that stretch, the program qualified for eight NCAA tournaments (1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1990). In 1976, the Cougars hosted and won the West Regional, defeating Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton twice, in order to advance to the College World Series. In its first game, the team defeated Oklahoma, but then was eliminated by consecutive losses to Arizona State and Maine.\nFollowing the 1979 baseball season, renovations of Martin Stadium, Washington State's football venue, led to the construction of a new running track. It was to be located on the site of today's Bailey–Brayton Field, but excavation difficulties led to an exchange of sites. The Mooberry Track was built on the old Bailey Field, north of Martin Stadium, and a new baseball venue was built to the east, retaining the name Bailey Field.\nIn 1984, stadium lighting was installed at the venue, and the first nighttime college baseball game in the Pacific Northwest was played between Washington State and Washington on May 11, 1984. In 1989, the field hosted Washington State's first nationally televised games, played on April 30 and May 1 against California and shown on ESPN.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, two Cougars were named first team All-Americans. Both John Olerud, selected in 1988, and Aaron Sele, selected in 1990, had lengthy careers in Major League Baseball. In addition to being named an All-American in 1988, Olerud was named the National Player of the Year.\nBrayton retired after the 1994 season, finishing his career at WSU with 1,162 wins in 33 seasons. His Cougar teams reached ten NCAA tournaments and two College World Series.\nPost-Brayton.\nSteve Farrington.\nSteve Farrington, the head coach at Lower Columbia College in Longview for over a decade, was hired to replace Brayton in late June 1994. Originally from Newport, Oregon, he was a three-sport athlete at Eastern Washington in Cheney in the early 1970s; four years each of football and baseball and a year of basketball. Farrington's first season, 1995, was the third season of NCAA sanctions that had been imposed on the program for rules violations. The Cougars were in conference and won the Pac-10 North, but were swept in the Pac-10 finals in Los Angeles by South champion USC, 9–6 and 4–0. Their overall record of 28–30 () in 1995 was the first losing record at WSU since 1957, and the Cougars did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Pac-10 champion USC advanced to the College World Series and finished as runner-up.\nFrom 1996–1998, Farrington's teams finished third in the Pac-10 North three times, missing the playoffs in each season. In both 1999 and 2000, after the Pac-10 abolished its divisions, Washington State finished last in the Pac-10, with conference records of 4–20 and 6–18, and his contract was not renewed following the 2000 season. Farrington's overall record with the Cougars in six seasons was , with a regular season conference record of . He later coached baseball at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, while also teaching science at Richland High School.\nPrior to the 2000 season in January, Bailey Field was renamed Bailey–Brayton Field, adding Bobo Brayton's name to the Cougars' home venue.\nTim Mooney.\nIn August 2000, Albertson College (College of Idaho) head coach Tim Mooney was hired to replace Farrington. Raised in Weiser, Idaho, he played at neighboring Idaho in the late 1970s, the final years of the Vandal baseball program. Mooney had great success as a head coach at Albertson in Caldwell, including an NAIA national title in 1998.\nUnder Mooney, the Cougars had losing conference records in each of his four seasons and finished no higher than a tie for eighth in the Pac-10. The only year with a winning overall record was his last in 2004, at 29–26 (), and 9–15 () in conference. These struggles, combined with cases of Mooney physically and verbally abusing players, led to his resignation following the 2004 season. Mooney's overall record at WSU was and in conference. He was later a fundraiser for athletics for his alma mater in Moscow.\nDonnie Marbut era.\nDonnie Marbut, who had served as an assistant under Mooney for one season in 2004, was promoted to head coach in late May. In his first several seasons at the helm, the program continued to struggle, finishing no higher than a sixth-place tie in the Pac-10. Marbut was also officially reprimanded by the university in 2006, when a \"Seattle Times\" report revealed that he had falsified parts of his résumé when applying for a coaching position at Washington State.\nIn 2009 and 2010, however, the Cougars finished near the top of the Pac-10 and appeared in the NCAA tournament in both seasons–their first postseason bids in 20 years. In the 2009 tournament, the team appeared in the Norman Regional as a #3 seed. After losing the opening game to Arkansas, the Cougars defeated Wichita State 3–2 in an elimination game. In the next game, however, they were eliminated by Oklahoma. In the 2010 tournament, the team earned a #2 seed in the Fayetteville Regional. This time, the team made it to within one win of the Super Regional round, but lost to Arkansas 7–2 in the elimination game. These are the Cougars' last postseason appearances to date.\nAfter eleven seasons, a 314–304 record, and two post-season appearances, athletic director Bill Moos announced Marbut would not be returning for the 2016 season.\nMarty Lees.\nOn June 3, 2015, Marty Lees, an assistant from Oklahoma State was named head coach. After 4 seasons and an 68–132–1 record, Lees was fired on May 21, 2019.\nBrian Green.\nOn June 3, 2019, Brian Green was hired as the head coach away from the same position at New Mexico State. He led the Cougars for 4 seasons, compiling a 91–76 record, before getting hired as the head coach of the Wichita State Shockers on June 5, 2023.\nNathan Choate.\nOn June 23, 2023, Nathan Choate was announced as the new head coach for the Cougars, having served in the same position for the Loyola Marymount Lions since 2020.\nIn 2024, after a mass exodus from the Pac-12 left Oregon State and Washington State as its only remaining members, the two schools announced they would become associate members of the West Coast Conference for all of that conference's sponsored sports, except for baseball. At the time of the announcement, on December 22, 2023, both schools had a 30-day window to potentially add baseball to their membership. The window expired on January 26, 2024 with no announcement from the WCC or either school. On April 16, 2024, Washington State announced that the baseball team would become an associate of the Mountain West Conference instead, beginning in the 2025 season (2024-25 academic year).\nVenues.\nOld Bailey Field.\nFollowing the Cougars' runner-up finish at the College World Series in 1950, the program's home venue was renamed Bailey Field. The Cougars played at the field through the end of the 1979 season; it was located on the current site of Mooberry Track, with home plate at its northwest corner.\nBailey–Brayton Field.\nFollowing the 1978 football season, the university expanded Martin Stadium and removed its running track; a new track &amp; field venue was planned to the northeast, at the site of the present baseball stadium. Difficulties in excavation and soil compaction led to the switch of track and baseball sites in 1979, and a new baseball stadium was built; it maintained the name Bailey Field when it opened at the start of the 1980 season.\nThe field was renovated in 1981, 1984, and 1988. It was renamed Bailey–Brayton Field in early 2000, for Chuck Brayton, the program's head coach from 1962 to 1994. The facility has a capacity of 3,500 spectators and features a FieldTurf surface, electronic scoreboard, and stadium lighting.\nHead coaches.\nThe Cougars' head coach is Nathan Choate, hired on June 23, 2023.\nThe program's longest-tenured and most successful head coach is Chuck Brayton, who was head coach for 33 seasons (1962–1994) and led the Cougars to 1,162 wins.\nYearly records.\nThe following is a list of the program's yearly records since 1892, its first season of varsity competition.\nNotable former players.\nThe following is a list of notable former Cougars and the seasons in which they played for the program.\n2012 MLB Draft.\nFive Cougars were selected in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft: 1B Taylor Ard by the Seattle Mariners (7th round), OF Derek Jones by the Colorado Rockies (8th round), 2B Tommy Richards by the Baltimore Orioles (24th round), OF Kyle Johnson by the Los Angeles Angels (25th round), and 3B Patrick Claussen (34th round).

        "text": "Dangerous play in rugby union is dealt with under the foul play law (Law 9) in the official International Rugby Board (IRB) rugby union law book. It defines foul play as \"anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game\". Under these laws dangerous play includes; punching or striking, stamping or trampling, and kicking.\nProcess.\nIf a referee observes dangerous play they are obliged to penalise and admonish the perpetrator. This can result in a \"temporary suspension\" (yellow card) of 10 minutes or even a \"sending off\" (red card). If the offence is serious enough further action can be taken after the game, including bans from playing rugby and criminal charges. In some high-profile matches a citing commissioner is appointed, who can cite any player for dangerous play, whether they have been detected by the referee or not. In matches where there is no appointed citing commissioner the Unions involved can cite players for dangerous play. During the judicial process the severity of the incident is considered. This is assessed by judging if the offending was intentional, reckless, provoked or premeditated as well as what body part was used (fist, knee, boot etc.), how vulnerable the victim was, the effect of the actions had on the victim and disciplinary record of the offender. When handing out match suspensions for dangerous play the IRB recommends suspension periods based on the type and severity of the offence. For most incidences of dangerous play (punching, stamping, dangerous tackles etc.) they recommend suspensions starting from two weeks, up to a maximum of one year. The more serious offences include striking with the head (up to two years), making contact with the eyes (up to three years), testicle grabbing (up to four years) and biting (up to four years).\nMisconduct.\nThe law that deals with dangerous play also applies to misconduct. Misconduct is any conduct (excluding foul play during a match) that is unsporting, unruly, ill-disciplined or that brings the sport of rugby union into disrepute. Misconduct deals with violence or intimidation that occurs within the venue (i.e. changing rooms, tunnel, warmup area), abuse of match officials or spectators, discriminatory statements, bribery, betting on involved games or lying about past disciplinary records. The penalty handed down for misconduct cases could be a caution, fine, suspension (for a number of matches or time period), exclusion from Rugby Unions or grounds, suspension from Rugby officiating or a combination of the above. Verbal abuse of match officials can be punished by up to a year suspension, while threatening could result in five years and physical abuse of an official could see the offender banned for life. Racial or other discriminatory abuse could see a player banned for up to a year. Players banned can go to the crown kings general court so that they can get the time on their ban reduced.\nHistory.\nEarly Rugby games were played under a code of conduct that varied between each school or club. As the popularity and number of clubs increased a set of standardised rules were developed. On 24 November 1863 a set of rules were developed by the Football Association (FA) that included the first law involving dangerous play. Law 10 stated that: \"If any player with the ball should run towards his advisories' goal, any player in the opposition side should be at liberty to charge, hold, trip, or hack him, or wrest the ball from him; but no player shall be held or hacked at the same time\". Hacking (tripping an opponent and kicking his shins) and carrying the ball were the most contested rules and they were soon scrapped by the FA. This caused some clubs to leave the Association and soon more games were played that involved hacking and carrying the ball than those that followed the FA's \"official\" laws. Concerns over hacking came to a head in 1870 when a surgeon published a letter in the times complaining about the number of rugby injuries he had dealt with that involved hacking, and chastised the schools for letting it continue.\nPunching and fighting.\nDuring the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa, Lions captain Willie McBride devised a plan where on a set call every player would attack a South African player, reasoning that this would prevent the referee form penalising any one individual, as he could not send the whole team off.\nAfter French fullback Serge Blanco was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman Nigel Heslop during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker Éric Champ knocked Heslop out with a punch. In 1990 English lock Paul Ackford was unexpectedly hit by a haymaker from Argentine prop Federico Mendez after being mistaken for another player who made contact with Mendez's head. During the British and Irish Lions 2001 tour match against Australian state side the New South Wales Waratahs, fullback Duncan McRae punched Lions Fly half Ronan O'Gara multiple times as he lay prone on the ground. He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian off-season he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators. Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation.\nStamping and kicking.\nIn a 1927 match involving Quillan, the strongest team in France at the time, and Perpignan, the Quillan hooker Gaston Riviere received such a kicking that he died from his injuries. Welsh fullback JPR Williams was the victim of stamping by touring New Zealand prop John Ashworth in 1978. After receiving 30 stitches from his father he returned to the game. A player for Welsh club Pontycymmer was jailed for 15 months after stomping on an opposition player's head during a rugby game in 2005. In 2006 a South African rugby player from the Western Cape died after allegedly being kicked in the head during a rugby match.\nBiting.\nSouth African prop Johan le Roux bit New Zealand hooker Sean Fitzpatrick's ear during a scrum during a test in 1994, receiving an 18-month ban. After the disciplinary hearing he stated that \"For an 18-month suspension, I feel I probably should have torn it off\". Kevin Yates, an English international, was cited for foul play in 1998 by London Scottish after a player suffered a serious injury to his left ear and subsequently received a six-month ban. In 2008 an English club player was banned for eighty weeks following a biting incident that left a player with \"a partial amputation of the right index finger\". A Welsh club rugby player was jailed for a year in 2008 for biting an opponent's earlobe off. After a scuffle during a 2009 rugby match in the Cape Town suburb of Brackenfell, a player had to have his fingertip reattached after an alleged biting incident.\nDangerous tackles.\nNew Zealand players Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu were involved in an illegal spear tackle on Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll at the start of the first test during the 2005 tour. The tackle dislocated O'Driscoll's shoulder, putting him out of the rest of the tour. Although cited, no suspensions were handed to either Umaga or Mealamu.\nEye-gouging.\nEye-gouging is a serious offence where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as \"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent\" but such incidents are usually referred to as \"eye-gouging\" among players and in the media. The IRB has made special mention of eye gouging, describing it as \"particularly heinous\". Following two high-profile test match incidents, involving Schalk Burger and Sergio Parisse, during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence \"in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated\".\nOn 2 October 2010, Gavin Quinnell of the Welsh regional team Scarlets suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game between Scarlets feeder club Llanelli and Cross Keys. The following Thursday it was confirmed that, despite the best efforts of surgeons, he had lost the sight in his left eye. The incident is currently being investigated by the Welsh Rugby Union and Gwent Police. Clarence Harding, an amateur player, lost sight in his right eye after an incident. On 24 November 2010 the player alleged to have been responsible was cleared of all charges due to lack of evidence."

With the home team winning 1–0 in both matches, the aggregate score was tied 1–1, and, with no away goal advantage, the play-off was decided by a penalty shoot-out, which Australia won 4–2 in order to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since the 1974 tournament.\nIt was the second consecutive FIFA World Cup where the two sides had played each other for a place in the tournament. On the first occasion in 2001, Uruguay won 3–1 on aggregate. The draw for determining the order of the home and away legs was made at a FIFA congress on 10 September 2005. Australia finally won a FIFA World Cup play-off after losing to Scotland (1986), Argentina (1994), Iran (1998) and the own Uruguay (2002).\nIn the second leg, there was heavy booing by Australian fans during Uruguay's national anthem, in response to the dirty tricks, spitting and punches thrown at the Australian team on their previous playoff meeting.\nAftermath.\nAustralia qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Finals in Germany and were drawn into Group F with defending champions Brazil, Croatia and Japan. After beating Japan 3–1 in their opening match, Australia lost 2–0 to Brazil and in the final match they also drew 2–2 with Croatia, finishing second in the group on four points. In the Round of 16, Australia were defeated 1–0 by the eventual champions, Italy.\nFor Uruguay it was the third FIFA World Cup out of four since 1990 they failed to qualify. Jorge Fossati lost his job and rehired Óscar Tabárez who managed the team before (1988–1990), and Uruguay entered the \"Proceso\" era breaking many records and have qualified for every FIFA World Cup since 2010.\nIn 2009, Australian Broadcasting Corporation ranked Australia's victory in 2005 as number one on their list of milestone sporting moments of the 2000s. Melbourne paper the \"Herald Sun\" named Australia's victory in 2005 as one of 100 great moments in Australian sports history.\nA documentary titled \"November 16\" was released in 2015 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the second leg. It featured interviews with Álvaro Recoba, Fabián Carini and members of the Australian squad."

Jerry Kelly finished with 65, in what was shaping up to be a good chance for the U.S. to get its first major win since the 2010 Masters Tournament. Pre-tournament favorite Rory McIlroy injured his wrist on the 3rd hole, but was able to grind out an even par round of 70. The defending champion, Martin Kaymer shot a 2-over-par round of 72 to sit 9 shots off the lead, while the champion from 2003, Shaun Micheel shot a 4-under-par round of 66 to be in 3rd place alone. Tiger Woods, despite stating that he felt good about his game before the tournament, shot a 77, to finish +7 and in danger of missing the cut.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 12, 2011\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 13, 2011\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 14, 2011\"\nThird round co-leader Brendan Steele faded quickly with four early bogeys; he shot 77 and ended in a tie for 19th. Steve Stricker birdied the first to pull within a shot of the lead, but a double bogey on 4 led to a final score of 73. Robert Karlsson stormed into contention with an eagle on the par-5 12th hole to pull him to −8 and within a shot of leader Jason Dufner. Anders Hansen also began a late charge and after birdies at 12 and 13 pulled within two shots of Dufner at −7. David Toms also made a charge, birdieing six of nine holes in the middle of the round, but a bogey on 16 dropped him out of contention. Keegan Bradley made an eagle of his own on 12 after knocking the approach to two feet to tie Dufner for the lead at −9. Dufner birdied both 12 and 13 to take a two-shot lead at −11.\nAt the par-3 15th hole, Bradley hit his tee shot left of the green, then chipped into the water and was unable to get up and down from drop area. The triple-bogey 6 left him at −6, five shots out of the lead with three holes to play. Following his eagle at 12, Karlsson parred the next three holes but bogeyed the last three to end his chances for a first major. After a bogey by Hansen at 16, Dufner had a five-shot lead at −11 on the 15th tee. He hit his tee shot into the water, but got up-and-down for a bogey to drop to −10. Scott Verplank chipped in for birdie from the bunker on 16 to pull within three shots of the lead. His playing partner Bradley also birdied 16 to pull within three shots. Hansen made a 15-footer (4.5 m) for birdie on 17 to pull to −7, three shots back. Verplank needed to attack the par-3 17th hole, but hit his tee shot from off the protecting wall into the water to end his chances of a late charge. Bradley landed his tee shot in the middle of the green. Dufner hit his approach on 16 into the greenside bunker; but again failed to save par and fell to −9. Bradley then sank a putt for birdie to get to −8 and cut the lead to one, as Dufner watched from the 17th tee.\nHansen two-putted for par on 18 and had the clubhouse lead of −7. After hitting on the 17th green, Dufner knocked his first putt well past the hole and bogeyed to fall to −8; his five-stroke lead was gone. After hitting hybrid off the 18th tee, Bradley hit his approach to the center of the green, leaving a long birdie putt. He lagged to one foot and tapped in to post the new clubhouse lead of −8. After Dufner hit driver in the fairway on 18 he hit four iron to the middle of the green. Dufner than lagged his putt to two feet (0.6 m) and tapped in to tie Bradley and force a three-hole playoff.\nSource:\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nThe three-hole aggregate playoff was played on the final three holes, with sudden-death to follow in case of a tie. Starting on 16, Dufner's approach shot rolled right by the hole and settled 8 feet behind the cup. Bradley answered by knocking his approach to four feet. After Dufner missed his birdie putt, Bradley made his short birdie putt to take a one shot lead. On the playoff's par-three second hole, Dufner and Bradley both put their tee balls on to the green. Dufner was first to play, from about , and ran his putt past the hole. Bradley knocked his birdie putt past the hole. Dufner missed his long comebacker for par and Bradley made his par putt to take a two-shot lead with one hole to play.\nBradley elected to take hybrid off the tee on 18, as he did in regulation, and found the fairway. Dufner hit driver in the fairway, just as he did in regulation. With a two shot lead Bradley put his approach shot comfortably on the front of the green, leaving it from the cup. Dufner knocked his approach next to Bradley's, about from the hole. Two strokes down, Dufner needed to make his birdie putt to have any chance to extend the playoff and did just that. Bradley then needed to two-putt for par to win his first major. Bradley lagged the first putt just past the hole, then tapped in for the win. Bradley became the first male player to win in his major debut since Ben Curtis at the 2003 Open Championship and the first to win a major using a long (belly) putter.\nThis was the seventh consecutive major championship won by a player who had not previously captured a major title, establishing a new record.\nScorecard.\n\"Playoff\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "Golf on TNT",
        "text": "TNT's golf coverage is produced by Turner Sports and consists of television broadcasts of professional golf events in the United States. \nTNT was the long-running holder of cable rights to the PGA Championship (with full coverage of the first two rounds and early coverage of the weekend rounds since 1999 after being on sister channel TBS since 1991) under a contract with the PGA of America. From 2003 to 2009, TNT also held the cable rights to The Open Championship.\nThe channel has generally only carried major competitions, as opposed to the other week-to-week tournaments which are under the auspices of the PGA Tour, an organization which is independent of the PGA of America.\nSince 2020, TNT has televised \"The Match\", a series of exhibition matches with top professional golfers and professional athletes from other sports.\nHistory.\nIn the past, TNT owned cable rights to the (British) Open Championship, as well as the Women's British Open and Senior British Open, from 2003 to 2009 (with ABC picking up weekend coverage), replacing (and ultimately being replaced by) ESPN. TNT carried the first two rounds of the PGA Championship through 2019, with Turner having covered the event since 1991, at first on TBS and later TNT. TNT also carried the biennial PGA Tour-managed Presidents Cup from 2000 to 2007; Golf Channel assumed those rights beginning with the 2009 event as part of its overall deal for PGA Tour cable rights. TNT also broadcast the first two rounds of the Target World Challenge from 1999 to 2002, and the first three rounds of the five-round Bob Hope Chrysler Classic from 1995 to 1998, along with other select events.\nBeginning in 2004, TNT as well as CBS, began broadcasting the PGA Championship in HDTV, although some cameras used SD widescreen through 2006. Meanwhile, the Open Championship was shown in widescreen SD from 2004 through the end of TNT's run in 2009 (weekend rights-holder ABC was forced to do the same, as only SD widescreen cameras were used by the home BBC broadcast). The 2007 Presidents Cup was mostly in HD, with a handful of SD widescreen cameras also being used (this was the standard setup of weekend rights-holder NBC at the time).\nOn October 10, 2018, it was announced that ESPN would replace TNT as the PGA Championship's cable partner beginning in 2020, with CBS remaining broadcast television rightsholder. This deal left TNT without any golf coverage.\nScheduled time for Turner coverage by year.\nBritish Open\nPGA Championship\nThe Match.\nIn May 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, TNT gained the rights to “Capital One’s The Match 2: Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning vs. Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady”. The event took place May 24 at the Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida. The regular TNT golf team from the 2019 PGA covered the event, in addition to \"NBA on TNT\" analyst Charles Barkley and PGA Tour player Justin Thomas.\nTNT had previously produced coverage of the original “The Match” event between Woods and Mickelson in 2018, however that aired only on pay-per-view. Like the original, “The Match 2” featured all players mic’d up, and also provided earpieces to allow the players, from their custom-designed golf carts, to chat with the members of the broadcast booth (including Barkley) who were in the 18th tower.\nThe telecast, which was delayed slightly by rain, peaked at 6.3 million viewers, and averaged 5.8 million for the afternoon. The 3pm EDT Sunday broadcast was the highest rated and most watched golf event ever to air on a cable channel, meaning the telecast beat every Thursday and Friday round in PGA Tour history including TNT's own coverage of the British Open, PGA Championship, and Presidents Cup."

They were led by head coach Fran Dunphy and played their home games at the Liacouras Center. The Owls are members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They finished the season 22–12 and 11–5 in A-10 play. They won the 2009 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament for the second consecutive year to receive the conference's automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nDionte Christmas led Temple in three statistics: points per game (19.5), three-pointers completed (107), and total steals (51); he finished second in two more: rebounds per game (5.5) and assists (28). In addition, he was an honorable mention All-American and scored 2,000 points over his college basketball career. Also graduating were two other starters: 7–0 center Sergio Olmos, who was selected as an All-A10 Tournament player, and point guard Semaj Inge.\nPreseason.\nOn October 28, 2008, the Owls were picked by other Atlantic 10 coaches to finish second, behind Xavier, and received 12 first place votes. Dionte Christmas was chosen to the Preseason First Team after leading the league in scoring the past two seasons. Lavoy Allen was named to the Preseason Defensive Team.\nSeason.\nPreconference season.\nDionte Christmas scored 35 points to lead Temple past #8 Tennessee on December 13 88–72. This was Temple's first win over a top ten team since the 2006 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament, when the Owls upset #6 George Washington; John Chaney was coaching Temple at the time. The Owls started the game with an 8–0 lead and never faltered, with Tennessee only tying the score at 15 and never leading. Christmas started the second half with a three-pointer and scored three consecutive threes on a 17–6 run. For the game, he was 7-for-14 from the perimeter and 12-for-22 from the field. Sergio Olmos's 19 points were a career high, and Ryan Brooks registered a double-double of 16 points and 12 rebounds.\nPostseason.\nTemple was given a four seed in the 2009 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament; they received a bye and faced Saint Joseph's in the quarterfinals.\nIn the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Temple was seeded eleventh in the South Regional, where they faced the sixth-seeded Arizona State Sun Devils in the first round. On March 20, 2009, behind a then career-high 22 points by Sun Devil Derek Glasser, Arizona State eliminated Temple 66–57. The Owls never had a lead, but cut the deficit to 52–49, the closest the game ever got. Temple's offense went without a field goal in the final 5:02. However, their defense held Arizona State star James Harden to nine points, less than half his season average, and 1-of-8 shooting. Dionte Christmas played all 40 minutes, shot 5-for-11 from behind the arc and scored 29 points in his final collegiate game."

Listed at , , he batted and threw right-handed. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Mills was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the major leagues only during the World War II years.\nEarly life.\nMills started with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1944 as an unsigned free agent out of Holy Cross, where he was a member of the football and baseball squads from 1939 through 1943.

He was used primarily as a pinch-hitter in four games and caught one game, going 1-for-4 for a .250 batting average.\nFollowing his major league stint, Mills played in the minor leagues until 1949. Over a five-year career, he posted a .286 average with 17 home runs in 316 games. \nLater life.\nAfter retirement, Mills returned to his native Boston and pursued a teaching and coaching career at the high school level.

He averaged 32.9 points per game in 29 games played and set still-standing school records for points in a single game (53) and season (953).\nHouston was raised in Pearl River, New York and was a three-year starter on the varsity basketball team at Pearl River High School. He was a diminutive , 165 lbs. in his prime during college, so as a high school player was even smaller. His small stature played a big role in why he was overlooked by college scouts.\nHouston decided to attend the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School in New Jersey for one year after high school. The United States Military Academy (Army), located in his home state of New York, was the only university that had shown Houston any interest during his basketball recruitment. He enrolled at Army in the fall of 1983 to play for the Black Knights. During his four-year career, Houston started every single one of the 113 games he played in, which ties him for the most all-time games played in Army history. By the time he graduated from the Academy in 1987, he had re-written the school's record book. Houston scored still-standing program records for points in a game (53), season (953), career (2,325), and season points per game (32.9) among others. He was the first ever Army player to be named the Haggerty Award winner, an honor that he shared as a senior with St. John's Mark Jackson, which is given to the best men's basketball player in the greater New York City metropolitan area. Houston was also the 1986–87 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year and the NCAA season scoring champion. He was a three-time All-MAAC honoree, two-time honorable mention All-American and one-time third team All-American.\nAfter college, Houston served his mandatory stint in the United States Army for several years. He got into high school coaching and guided the Storm King School, located in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, to two New England Private School Championships in just seven years. One of his players was future NBA draft pick Sammy Mejia. Kevin was married to his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Cuccia, for 21 years before she died on January 3, 2009. They have three children: Lauren, Luke and Leanne."

He later played professionally for several seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL). After his playing career, he was an assistant coach for Iowa. Gilliam was a member of the University of Iowa’s all-time football team.\nBackground.\nFrank Gilliam attended high school in Steubenville, Ohio, and was football teammate with Calvin Jones and Eddie Vincent. Frank was nicknamed \"Shag\" because of the baggy pants he liked to wear. Gilliam and Vincent committed to play for the Iowa Hawkeyes, while Cal Jones committed to play for Ohio State. However, at the last minute, Jones switched his commitment and decided to accompany Gilliam and Vincent to the University of Iowa. Gilliam, Vincent, and Jones became affectionately known as the \"Steubenville Trio\".\nIowa career.\nAs a sophomore in 1953, Frank Gilliam, who played the right end position, helped Iowa to an excellent season. Iowa’s final game of that season was against #1 Notre Dame in South Bend. With 2:06 remaining in the game, Gilliam made a diving catch in the end zone to give Iowa a 14–7 lead. But Notre Dame completed a touchdown pass with six seconds to play to salvage a 14–14 tie, thanks in large part to an injury timeout that was granted when two Notre Dame players fell at the same time. The tie cost the Irish the #1 spot in the final AP Poll, dropping them to a distant #2. Iowa rocketed into the AP rankings, finishing the year ninth in the nation and garnering six first-place votes. It was Iowa’s highest ranking since 1939.\nIn 1954, Iowa finished with a 5–4 record. Before Gilliam’s senior season in 1955, he broke his leg and was forced to sit out for a year. Jones and Vincent played their senior seasons in 1955, with Cal Jones winning the Outland Trophy.\nIn Gilliam’s senior season of 1956, Iowa had a 9–1 record, winning the Big Ten and a trip to the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history. Frank Gilliam was named a second-team All-American after the season. The happy occasion was marred, however, by the discovery that Gilliam’s close friend, Cal Jones, had died in a plane crash in the mountains of western Canada during a howling windstorm. Frank Gilliam’s final game with the Hawkeyes came in the 1957 Rose Bowl, where Iowa defeated Oregon State, 35–19.\nProfessional career.\nFrank Gilliam played for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League for three seasons from 1957–1959. After retiring from professional football, he was a teacher for a few years before becoming an assistant coach to Jerry Burns at the University of Iowa from 1966–1970. Gilliam then joined the Minnesota Vikings, where he was a scout and personnel man for over 36 years. He left the Vikings in 2007, after deciding to pursue other career opportunities.\nIn 1989, Iowa fans selected an all-time University of Iowa football team during the 100th-anniversary celebration of Iowa football, and Frank Gilliam was selected as a starting end.\nDeath.\nGilliam died on April 2, 2023, at the age of 89."

He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal. Martin was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers. After retiring from professional football, Jonathan Martin became an entrepreneur, and founded two real estate start-up companies in central Texas.\nEarly life and education.\nMartin's father, Gus Martin, is a Harvard University graduate and a professor of criminal justice administration at California State University, Dominguez Hills. His mother, Jane Howard-Martin, is also a Harvard graduate and is a corporate lawyer for Toyota. Martin has a total of nine relatives who graduated from Harvard including his grandfather, a professor in international development, and his maternal great grandfather, one of a dozen black students there in the 1920s.\nMartin attended John Thomas Dye School in the Los Angeles area and for high school, he attended nationally ranked Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, California. He was an all-section and All-Mission League selection as a senior in 2007 and earned All-Mission League honors as a junior in 2006.\nRegarded as a three-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Martin was ranked as the No. 44 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2008, which was highlighted by Mike Adams and Matt Kalil. Martin originally committed to play for the UCLA Bruins. However, after getting cleared academically by Stanford University, he de-committed from UCLA and committed to the Cardinal on January 11, 2008.\nCollege career.\nAt Stanford University, Martin majored in classics. As a redshirt freshman in 2009, Martin started 11 of 13 games at left tackle. He was one of two freshman starters on the offensive line, along with left guard David DeCastro. Despite its inexperience, the Cardinal offensive line allowed a Pac-10-low seven sacks on the year, enabling Stanford's freshman quarterback Andrew Luck to lead the conference in passing efficiency at 143.47. On the ground, Cardinal running back Toby Gerhart rushed for a school-record 1,871 yards and 28 touchdowns in 2009. Martin was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection and a second-team freshman All-American by CollegeFootballNews.com.\nIn his sophomore year, Martin started all games at left tackle and was named a first-team All-American by Scout.com. Fellow linemen DeCastro and center Chase Beeler also received All-America recognition, as the Cardinal offensive line allowed just six sacks on the season, the second fewest in the FBS behind only Air Force. Quarterback Andrew Luck led the Pac-10 in passing efficiency for the second year in a row.\nWith Jonathan Martin anchoring the left tackle position, the 2010 Stanford Cardinal Football Team ended the regular season 11-1 and defeated Virginia Tech 40–12 in the Orange Bowl for the first BCS bowl victory in program history.\nAs a junior, Martin again started all games and earned All-America honors by Scout.com and the Walter Camp Foundation.\nProfessional career.\n2012 NFL Draft.\nOn January 3, 2012, Martin announced he was declaring for the 2012 NFL Draft. He was regarded as the No. 3 tackle prospect in the 2012 NFL Draft, behind Matt Kalil and Riley Reiff. He was projected to be a late-first or early-second round selection.\nAt the 2012 NFL Draft, Martin was selected in round 2, with the 42nd overall pick by the Miami Dolphins. Despite playing mostly at left tackle in college, the Dolphins drafted him to play at right tackle.\nMiami Dolphins.\nDuring his rookie season, Martin started at right tackle from the beginning of training camp and struggled early in preseason with giving up sacks and penalties. On October 2, 2012, Martin was fined $10,000 for illegal clipping, a standard fine imposed on a player for the common foul of blocking an opponent from behind and below the waist. In December 2012, Martin was moved over to left tackle to take over for Pro Bowler Jake Long, who had been placed on injured reserve with a torn triceps. Martin had started the first 12 games of the season at right tackle, ranking 63rd out of the 69 NFL tackles who had played at least 300 snaps, according to Pro Football Focus’ grading system.\nFor the 2013 season, Martin was slotted at left tackle in order to replace Long, who had left in free agency, and was noted to struggle throughout the early part of the season in pass protection. On October 21, 2013, the Dolphins signed Bryant McKinnie to take over at left tackle, moving Martin back over to right tackle. The \"Miami Herald\" reported that the Dolphins were concerned about moving Martin due to the impact on him. Writing for the \"Herald\", Armando Salguero reported \"It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move. 'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said. 'You can go in the tank and be one of those guys who bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays as hard as I can.' Martin stated he'll be the latter.\"\nOn October 30, 2013, it was reported that Martin had left team facilities two days earlier, citing \"emotional\" reasons. It was initially reported that he had been mistreated by some teammates during lunch that day when they asked him to sit with them, but then promptly got up and left the table when he sat down. Martin was subsequently listed on the injury report with an unspecified injury and missed the Dolphins' game on October 31. It was later reported that during this period Martin had briefly checked into a hospital for emotional distress before flying to his parents' home in California, where he is \"preparing a detailed document for his cooperation with a league investigation into a string of alleged multiple incidents he says led to his emotional distress and exit from the team\".\nOn November 2, it was reported that Richie Incognito's ring-leading role in the harassment of Martin dating as far back as the 2012 season was being reviewed by the NFL Players Association. On November 3, Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins for \"conduct detrimental to the team.\" The next day, it was reported that Incognito had sent numerous texts and voicemails making threats against Martin and Martin's family.\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the most egregious of these exchanges was a highly graphic voicemail Incognito left in April 2013, in which Incognito called Martin a \"half-nigger piece of shit,\" threatened to slap Martin's mother across the face and even uttered a death threat against Martin. Until obtaining the tape from Martin's legal team, the Dolphins had publicly maintained the charges against Incognito were pure speculation. Schefter said that as late as the afternoon of November 3, the Dolphins didn't even know the voicemail existed. However, within hours of hearing the tape, Incognito had been suspended. On November 5, the \"Sun-Sentinel\" reported that the message that ultimately led to Incognito's suspension was made after Martin missed two days of the team's voluntary workout program. The coaches asked Incognito to help \"toughen up\" Martin and \"get him into the fold\".\nOn November 11, a source close to Martin told ESPN's Lisa Salters that Martin was not willing to play for the Dolphins again, and planned to sit out the remainder of the 2013 season, which he did. In February 2014, a 144-page report by Ted Wells—an attorney hired by the NFL to investigate the scandal—found that Incognito and fellow linemen John Jerry and Mike Pouncey \"engaged in a pattern of harassment\" toward Martin, another offensive lineman, and an assistant trainer.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn March 11, 2014, it was reported that the Dolphins had agreed to trade Martin to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Under the conditions of the deal, the Dolphins would receive a 2015 seventh round draft pick if Martin was on the 49ers' opening 53-man roster. With right tackle Anthony Davis out due to injury, Martin started the first game of the 2014 season with the 49ers against the Cowboys. On March 26, 2015, Martin was waived by the 49ers.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn March 27, 2015, the Carolina Panthers claimed Martin off waivers.\nRetirement and later life.\nMartin retired from the NFL on July 27, 2015, citing a back injury that would have made him miss the entire 2015 season. One month later, he posted a message to Facebook describing mental health struggles and suicide attempts as among additional factors in his decision to leave the sport.\nSoon after retiring, Martin returned to Stanford to complete his degree and spent several months as a national spokesperson for Beyond Differences, a group focused on creating a more inclusive community and combatting bullying in middle and high schools in the Bay Area.\nOn February 23, 2018, Martin was taken into police custody following a post to his Instagram account with an image of a shotgun and a caption that read: \"When you're a bully victim &amp; a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge.\" Following the post, which also mentioned his former high school, Harvard-Westlake School, the school shut down for the day. Martin voluntarily checked himself into a mental hospital soon after posting the picture, where he was later questioned by LAPD detectives.\nIn October 2019, Martin entered into a diversion program while receiving praise from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Kirschner, who stated he “independently made efforts to address his issues and did frankly an excellent job in bringing himself to a state of stability and good mental health.” In October 2021, Martin completed the diversion program, and all criminal charges were dismissed. He will have no criminal record.\nIn 2019, Jonathan Martin co-founded Treehorn Properties, a wholesaling real estate platform focused on distressed properties in Central Texas alongside a Stanford undergraduate classmate and former teammate named Griff Whalen. In 2020, Martin co-founded the Narrow Road Group, a real estate owner, operator, and developer platform with Whalen and a third co-founder, who is also a Stanford graduate. The same year, he also enrolled into a Masters in Finance and Real Estate program at Georgetown University, graduating with a 3.8 GPA in December 2022.\nIn August 2022, Martin enrolled at The Wharton School to pursue an MBA.

The statue of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was sculpted in bronze by Theresia R. van der Pant.\nThe statue was commissioned by the Amsterdam Contact Group of Women's Organisations in 1964. The money was provided by the population of Amsterdam.\nThe initial commission envisaged an effigy of the queen seated behind a microphone, addressing the Dutch people on the wartime Radio Oranje programme of the BBC European Service, symbolising Wilhelmina's status as \"war queen\". Theresia van der Pant was not enthusiastic about this idea, arguing that several recent statues portrayed the elder, plucky Wilhelmina, such as Charlotte van Pallandt's in Rotterdam. Also, Van der Pant was most experienced sculpting animals. She therefore decided on a statue of the younger queen, riding horseback. Wilhelmina's daughter Queen Juliana assisted Van der Pant, suggesting what clothes Wilhelmina should wear.\nAt first Damrak street was considered as the location for the statue. Because the sculpture turned out larger than expected, and it was not intended as a place of remembrance and therefore could possibly clash with the National Monument on nearby Dam Square, it was unveiled on Rokin street in 1972."

        "title": "Cycling in San Francisco",
        "text": "Cycling in San Francisco has grown in popularity in recent years, aided by improving cycling infrastructure and community support. San Francisco's compact urban form and mild climate enable cyclists to reach work, shopping, and recreational destinations quickly and comfortably. Though San Francisco's famed steep hills can make cycling difficult, many parts of the city are relatively flat, including some of the most densely populated. However, heavy automobile traffic, the lack of bike lanes on many streets, and difficulty in crossing major streets deter most residents from cycling frequently in San Francisco.\nHistory.\nThe 1848 California Gold Rush transformed San Francisco from a small isolated town to the richest and most populous city on the West Coast within a single year. The city is situated on a roughly seven-by-seven mile square tip of the San Francisco Peninsula. Having little land upon which to develop, and laying out most of its streets and buildings in the pre-automobile era, San Francisco is now the second-most densely populated large city in the United States after New York City. The city's compact neighborhoods result in short trip distances for work, shopping, and recreation, which can be conveniently made by bicycle.\nSan Francisco's Transit First policy, adopted in 1973, identifies transit, bicyclists and pedestrians as the city's top transportation priorities. It states that \"Travel by public transit, by bicycle, and on foot must be an attractive alternative to travel by private automobile\", \"Decisions regarding the use of limited public street and sidewalk space shall encourage the use of public rights of way by pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit\", and \"Bicycling shall be promoted by encouraging safe streets for riding, convenient access to transit, bicycle lanes, and secure bicycle parking.\" A wide variety of city policies, neighborhood plans, and specific development plans have promoted these goals.\nAn expansion of existing bicycle infrastructure occurred as a result of the 1997 Bicycle Plan. Many miles of bike lanes were striped, hundreds of bike parking racks were installed, and educational programs were expanded. An update to the 1997 Bicycle Plan began in 2002 and was finished in 2005, although implementation of the plan was delayed until 2009 due to a lawsuit.\n2009 Bicycle Plan.\nThe 2009 San Francisco Bicycle Plan is the guiding document to be used by city agencies to \"increase safe bicycle use\" over the next five years. The plan has eight \"chapter goals\" which are to:\nThe 2009 Bicycle Plan recommends 60 near-term improvements to the bicycle route network, which are anticipated to be constructed \"within the next five years\" (by 2014). 52 of these improvements are the addition of bicycle lanes to city streets, 3 are intersection improvements, 2 are the addition of bicycle paths, 1 is a traffic signal improvement, 1 is a signage improvement, and 1 is a bicycle route improvement. These 52 bicycle lane additions will add 34 miles of streets with bicycle lanes to the already existing 45 miles of streets with bicycle lanes.\nThe SFMTA began implementation of these near-term improvements on August 9, 2010, with the construction of bicycle lanes on Townsend Street between Eighth Street and the Embarcadero. Six months later, at the end of January 2011, 11 miles of the 34 miles of the proposed additional bicycle lanes were completed.\nBetter Market Street Project.\nOn Tuesday, October 15, 2019, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency board voted unanimously in favor of the Better Market Street proposal, a plan to improve bike, pedestrian, and transit-priority infrastructure, and restrict the use of personal cars on Market Street.\nCulture.\nSan Francisco has an active and diverse cycling culture organized around many different bike-related social events and rides. Many of the well-known \"cycling cliques\" are represented here, including urban cyclists, road racing bicycle riders (\"roadies\"), messengers, and fixed-gear riders (\"fixie hipsters\"). San Francisco is also home to the film producer Macaframa, which produces short films featuring urban fixed-gear cycling.\nBicycle clubs.\nRecreational bicycle clubs located in San Francisco include San Francisco Cycle Club, Mission Cycling, SF Fixed, Different Spokes, Velo Girls, Aids Lifecycle, and Team in Training. These groups normally post ride calendars on their webpages and are open to cyclists of varying skill levels.\nSunday Streets.\nIntroduced in 2008, Sunday Streets aims to promote public health and community participation by closing a series of streets on automobile traffic on selected Sundays throughout the year. In 2008, there were two events (two different Sundays) on two unique routes, in 2009, six events on four unique routes, in 2010, nine events on five unique routes, and in 2011, eight events on six unique routes. The events allow residents to bicycle, skate, run, walk, do yoga, or just people-watch in public spaces normally devoted to automobiles.\nBike to Work Day.\nSan Francisco's Bike to Work Day, held in May of each year, aims to encourage commuters to try bicycling as a healthy alternative means of getting to work by organizing groups of cyclists to ride together starting from various neighborhoods, matching new bicycle commuters with more experienced \"Bike Buddies\", and providing free snacks and coffee at \"Energizer Stations\" along the busiest routes. Bike to Work Day raises awareness of cycling as a form of transportation, as bicycle have far outnumbered automobiles on the main commercial street, Market Street, during commuting hours on Bike to Work Day in recent years.\nBike Kitchen.\nThe Bike Kitchen is a bike co-op — a 501(c)(3) non-profit assisted-self-service bike shop located at 650H Florida Street in the Mission neighborhood. Its mission is to \"teach people of all ages and backgrounds how to repair bicycles.\" Member pay a day-use fee, annual membership fee, or volunteer to gain access to the Bike Kitchen's tools, parts, and volunteer mechanics.\nCritical Mass.\nThe first Critical Mass bicycle ride took place on September 25, 1992, in San Francisco, and has since spread to hundreds of cities worldwide. The ride meets on the last Friday of each month at 6:00 pm at Justin Herman Plaza, and is typically attended by several thousand cyclists, who then ride through the city \"en masse\", claiming the normally auto-dominated streets for bicycle use. The event is controversial even within the cycling community in San Francisco, some claiming that it raises beneficial public awareness of cycling issues, and others claiming that it reduces public support for cyclists' needs by enraging motorists and commuters blocked by the event.\nSF Bike Party.\nIt was inspired by San Jose Bike Party in early 2011 and occurs on the first Friday of every month at 7:30 pm. Every month has a different ride theme and the enthused cyclists are dressed accordingly. The ride is very tame and organized. It is about 10 miles long with two 30 minutes stops to socialize and dance to the night. It is a great way to meet strangers and explore SF when the moon is up.\nTour de Fat.\nTour de Fat is a one-day bicycle parade and festival sponsored by the New Belgium Brewing Company and takes place each summer in Golden Gate Park. It features live music and circus and vaudeville-type acts. Profits from beer sales at the event are donated to the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition and the Bay Area Ridge Trail Council. The event is not unique to San Francisco, but in 2010 also took place in Chicago, Milwaukee, Seattle, Portland, Boise, Fort Collins, Denver, San Diego, Tempe, Los Angeles, and Austin.\nWinterfest.\nWinterfest, held in December of each year, is the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition's main fund-raising event. This \"festive evening to celebrate the love of riding a bike\" is attended by SFBC members, bicycle industry leaders, local business supporters, local artists, and politicians. In 2010, it was attended by over 1,000 people and raised $80,000 for the SFBC's advocacy efforts.\nBicycle Film Festival.\nThe Bicycle Film Festival, founded in 2001 in New York City by Brendt Barbur, \"celebrates the bicycle through music, art and, of course, film\". In San Francisco, the festival shows bicycle-related films on three consecutive nights in July at the Victoria Theatre near 16th and Mission streets. In 2010, the festival toured 36 cities worldwide.\nInfrastructure.\nBicycle route network.\nAs of 2008, San Francisco had 23 miles of streets with bike paths (Class I), 45 miles of streets with bike lanes (Class II), and 132 miles of streets with bike routes (Class III). Almost all of the bike paths are located in parks on the extreme western edge of the city: the Presidio, Lincoln Park, Golden Gate Park, and Fort Funston Park. Most of the bike lanes are located in relatively flat neighborhoods close to the center of the city, including SoMa, the Mission, Haight-Ashbury, and the Richmond. Bike routes form a nearly complete citywide network extending to most neighborhoods, but increase cyclists' safety very little. 53 miles of the bike routes are simply streets wide enough to ride on the right side clear of automobile traffic, 23 miles of the bike routes have sharrows painted on the street to indicate that cyclists may ride in the center of the lane, and 56 miles of the bike routes contain only signs indicating the number of the bicycle route, but no special design or marking for bicycles at all.\nBicycle parking.\nIn the past several years, the SFMTA has installed over 1,500 \"inverted-U\" bicycle parking racks. These are located on sidewalks in commercial districts and allow cyclists to easily lock up to two bicycles using secure U-locks. Since 2010, the SFMTA has installed ten \"bicycle corrals\", which are groups of five to eight inverted-U racks located in the street next to the sidewalk (usually replacing one automobile parking space). All parking garages in San Francisco open to the public must also provide a certain number of bicycle parking racks, the number of which is based on the number of automobile parking spaces provided.\nBicycle sharing.\nSan Francisco has a public bicycle-sharing system, Ford GoBike, which launched in 2013 and serves the city of San Francisco, as well as some outlying cities on both sides of the Bay Area.\nIn 2017, private bicycle-sharing company Bluegogo attempted to launch a dockless system in San Francisco, but pulled out due to legal concerns. Another private dockless bicycle-sharing company called Jump Bikes commenced operation in the city in January 2018 after obtaining an 18-month permit for operating its system of dockless electric bicycles.\nStatistics.\nPrevalence of cycling.\nAnnual bicycle counts conducted by the Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) in 2010 showed the number of cyclists at 33 locations had increased 58% from the 2006 baseline counts. The SFMTA estimates that about 128,000 trips are made by bicycle each day in the city, or 6% of total trips, and that 16% of San Francisco residents are \"frequent cyclists\", defined as cycling two or more days per week. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, bicycles accounted for 3.2% of all trips to work in 2009, up from 1.9% in 2003.\nSafety.\nThe SFMTA reported 468 bicycle injury collisions in 2008, which was the lowest number of injury collisions per work trip of the 12 other California cities with populations over 250,000. Of those collisions in which fault was assigned, half were found to be the fault of a motorist, and half were found to be the fault of the bicyclist. In collisions where motorists at fault, the most common reasons were: turning without signaling, opening the car door when it was unsafe, and not yielding to oncoming traffic when making a left turn.\nAdvocacy.\nSan Francisco Bicycle Coalition.\nThe San Francisco Bicycle Coalition (SFBC) is a California 501(c)(4) nonprofit public benefit corporation established to \"transform San Francisco's streets and neighborhoods into more livable and safe places by promoting the bicycle for everyday transportation.\" Founded in 1971, dormant through much of the 1980s, and re-founded in 1991, the SFBC in 2011 has a dues-paying membership of over 12,000, making it the largest bicycle advocacy organization in the United States. The SFBC organizes or promotes cycling-related events such as Bike to Work Day, Winterfest, Sunday Streets, and bike valet parking at public events.\nSan Francisco Bicycle Advisory Committee.\nThe San Francisco Bicycle Advisory Committee consists of 11 San Francisco voting members appointed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, each of whom resides in one of the 11 supervisorial districts and is nominated by their district's supervisor. In addition to the 11 voting members, non-voting representatives from the following city departments attend committee meetings: the Police Department, the Department of Public Works, the Municipal Railway, the Department of City Planning, and the Bureau of Engineering of the Department of Parking and Traffic. The committee was established by Ordinance 365-90 on 1990-11-09. Committee projects include oversight and facilitation of the five-year Bicycle Plan Update, improved transit access for bicycles, and funding for bicycle improvements to increase road safety."

        "title": "Climbing injuries",
        "text": "Injuries in rock climbing may occur due to falls, or due to overuse (see Sports injury). Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Such injuries are often no worse than torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage (esp. to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and joint capsules).\nRisk groups.\nThe climbers most prone to overuse injuries are intermediate to expert within lead climbing or bouldering, since these disciplines are the most athletic in nature.\nOveruse injuries in climbing.\nIn terms of overuse injuries a British study found that:\nOne injury that tend to be very common among climbers is Carpal tunnel syndrome. It is found in about 25% of climbers.\nFinger injuries.\n604 injured rock climbers were prospectively evaluated from January 1998 to December 2001, due to the rapid growth of new complex finger trauma in the mid-1980s. Of the most frequent injuries, three out of four were related to the fingers: pulley injuries accounted for 20%, tendovaginitis for 7%, and joint capsular damage for 6.1%.\nPulleys.\nDamage to the flexor tendon pulleys that encircle and support the tendons that cross the finger joints is the most common finger injury within the sport (see climber's finger).\nThe main culprit for pulley related injuries is the common crimp grip, especially in the closed position. The crimp grip requires a near ninety-degree flexion of the middle finger joint, which produces a tremendous force load on the A2 pulley. Injuries to the A2 pulley can range from microscopic to partial tears and, in the worst case, complete ruptures. Some climbers report hearing a pop, which might be a sign of a significant tear or complete rupture, during an extremely heavy move (e.g. tiny crimp, one- or two-finger pocket). Small partial tears, or inflammation can occur over the course of several sessions.\nClimbers recovering from pulley injuries rely on the RICE protocol: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Sufficient rest, ice to reduce swelling, compression for support, and hand elevation collectively foster an ideal healing environment.\nShoulder injuries.\nShoulder related injuries include rotator cuff tear, strain or tendinitis, biceps tendinitis and SLAP lesion.\nElbow injuries.\nTennis elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis) is a common elbow injury among climbers, as is Golfer's elbow (Medial Epicondylitis, which is similar, but occurs on the inside of the elbow).\nCalluses, dry skin.\nClimbers often develop calluses on their fingers from regular contact with the rock and the rope. When calluses split open they expose a raw layer of skin that can be very painful. This type of injury is commonly referred to as a flapper.\nThe use of magnesium carbonate (chalk) for better grip dries out the skin and can often lead to cracked and damaged hands \nThere are a number of skincare products available for climbers that help to treat calluses, moisturise dry hands and reduce recovery time.\nYoung/adolescent climbers.\n\"Any finger injury that is sustained by a young adolescent (12–16) should be seen by a physician and have x-rays performed. These skeletally immature athletes are very susceptible to developing debilitating joint arthritis later in adulthood.\""

        "text": "Timothy Regan (born December 28, 1949) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the American Hockey League (AHL), as well as with the Boston University Terriers (BU) and the United States National Team.\nPlaying for BU, Regan won two National Championships and set single season records for both goals against average (GAA) and save percentage. As a member of Team USA he was awarded a silver medal in the 1972 Winter Olympics. He received the medal despite leaving the team prior to the hockey tournament's completion in order to return to BU.\nPlaying career.\nWhen Regan began his collegiate career at Boston University freshmen were not allowed to play on varsity teams. As a result, Regan played for the Terriers' freshman team. In his freshman year he posted an 8–0 record and a 1.12 GAA as the team went undefeated at 17–0. Joining the varsity team the following year, he and teammate Dan Brady formed one of college hockey's \"all-time greatest goaltending tandems\". During his sophomore season Regan posted a 2.82 GAA, ranking him second in the ECAC East division, as the Terriers finished third in the ECAC Championship. In the 1970–71 season, Regan's junior year, he set BU records for both GAA (1.77) and save percentage (.929) which still stand. BU also won the National Championship; however, Regan was the backup during the championship run.\nIn August 1971 Regan was asked to try out for the United States Olympic hockey team. He declined the invitation, so as not to lose his scholarship. He later noted that he felt if he had left school at that point he probably would not ever return. In 1972 a flu epidemic presented Regan with another opportunity to represent the United States at the 1972 Winter Olympics. An exhibition game was scheduled between Team USA and Boston College (BC). Several members of the BC team had come down with the flu, and as a result, BC withdrew from the game and suggested that Team USA play BU instead. In the game Regan was terrific despite a 4–4 final score. The following day Team USA head coach Murray Williamson asked Regan to join the team. He agreed on the condition that he was guaranteed a trip to Sapporo, Japan, site of the Winter Games, and that if he was not playing he could return to BU should they need him. He played in 10 exhibition games with the National Team and traveled with them to Japan. When Team USA declared the roster for the Olympic tournament Regan was left off, meaning he would not get an opportunity to play in the tournament. As a result, he was asked to return to BU after Brady twisted his knee. Before the games ended Regan returned to BU and led them to their second consecutive National Championship. Regan was named Most Outstanding Player of the 1972 NCAA championship. After the Olympics ended, teammate Robbie Ftorek brought Regan's silver medal to him. He was awarded the medal for being part of Team USA, despite his early exit from the games. Upon giving him the medal, Ftorek told him, \"You're part of the program, you're part of the team, and this is yours.\"\nRegan was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the seventh round, 84th overall, in the 1970 NHL Entry Draft. He played three years in the Sabres organization, primarily in the American Hockey league. In 1993 he was inducted into the Boston University Hall of Fame.\nAfter retiring from hockey, Regan worked in the lumber industry in his hometown of Cranston, Rhode Island."

He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Arizona Coyotes and the Calgary Flames. He was selected by the then Phoenix Coyotes in the third round (69th overall) in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nHe is the older brother of Vegas Golden Knights captain Mark Stone.\nPlaying career.\nStone played two seasons of junior ice hockey with the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL before being selected 69th overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Phoenix Coyotes. He played two more seasons of ice hockey with the Hitmen before signing an entry-level contract with the Coyotes.\nStone made his NHL debut on February 18, 2012, recording 11:31 of ice-time in a 2–1 overtime win over the Dallas Stars. He then scored his first NHL goal on March 10, 2012, in a 3–0 win over the San Jose Sharks. Ultimately, Stone scored 1 goal and 2 assists in 13 games during the 2011–12 season.\nStone spent the early part of the 2012–13 season with the Portland Pirates, the Coyotes' AHL affiliate, due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, but joined the Coyotes again after the lockout ended. He scored 5 goals and 4 assists for 9 points in 40 games. After the season, the Coyotes signed Stone to a three-year, $3.45 million contract extension on July 6, 2013.\nAfter a successful 2015–16 season that saw Stone post a career-high 36 points for the Coyotes, he signed a one-year, $4 million contract extension with the Coyotes, avoiding salary arbitration on July 29, 2016.\nOn February 20, 2017, Stone was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a 2017 third-round pick and a 2018 conditional fifth-round pick. He recorded six points in 19 games to close out the season.\nOn June 30, 2017, the Flames re-signed Stone to a three-year, $10.5 million contract extension.\nAfter appearing in just eleven games to start the 2018–19 season, the Flames placed Stone on Injured Reserve with a blood clot on November 22. He made his return to the Flames' lineup on March 16, 2019 in a 2–1 loss to the Winnipeg Jets. However, he served mostly as a healthy scratch following this game, appearing in only two more games and sitting out the entirety of the Flames' postseason games.\nOn August 2, 2019, the Flames bought out the final year of Stone's contract, making him an unrestricted free agent. On September 11, Stone re-joined the Flames, signing a one-year, $700,000 contract. On January 18, 2021, Stone signed a one-year contract with the Flames.\nPrior to the season, Stone was again re-signed by the Flames as a free agent, agreeing to a one-year, $750,000 contract on September 10, 2021.\nStone retired from playing on July 5, 2023, and would take a role in the Flames player development team."

        "text": "Cricket in Vanuatu is an established and growing sport. Vanuatu's playing season runs from April to October, during the Vanuatu winter to avoid the heat and humidity of the tropical summer. There are 10 cricket clubs in Vanuatu.\nHistory.\nThe first reference of cricket being played in Vanuatu is 1905 through English settlers in what was then the New Hebrides, which Vanuatu was a part of. It became organised sometime after which matches involving the settlers and the native New Hebrideans from villages and the capital Port Vila were held for many decades prior to independence. During those decades the matches were played at a single ground. In the 1970s two grounds were built at a plantation half-way around the island of Efate and another at a country club 20 kilometres from Port Vila.\nIn 1995, Vanuatu were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. Since then the game has grown in popularity, particularly among Ni-Vanuatuan's. Vanuatu's debut in international cricket came in the Pacific Championships against Tonga in 2001. Vanuatu hosted the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup, in which they came third. They have since played in every other EAP Cricket Cup, except the 2008 competition which they did not enter. In 2008, Vanuatu made their debut in World Cricket League Division Five, emerging winless and relegated from the World Cricket League structure. In 2009 they became an Associate member of the International Cricket Council. Their next appearance in the World Cricket League came in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Eight. Their third-place finish in this competition kept them in the same competition for 2012.\nIn April and May 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Vanuatu was largely unaffected by the virus, and the country became the first to resume playing cricket.\nGoverning body.\nVanuatu Cricket Association is the official governing body of cricket in Vanuatu. Its current headquarters is in Port Vila. Vanuatu Cricket Association is Vanuatu representative at the International Cricket Council.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe BDO Club Championship is the Vanuatu's premier round-robin competition with as many as 10 sides competing each season. The competition is based in Port Vila. Running alongside this competition is an annual Twenty20 knockout competition called the Independence Cup. The final of this competition is held July 30, the date that Vanuatu gained independence from Great Britain and France.\nGrounds.\nAlong with the 2 grounds built in the 1970s, in the past 5 years 4 further grounds have been constructed to deal with an increased interest in the game in Vanuatu.\nNational team.\nThe Vanuatu national cricket team represents the country in international cricket matches. The national team, formed in 2001, play in the ICC EAP Cricket Cup and in the World Cricket League, in which it competes in Division Eight. The women's national team debuted in 2011."

        "text": "The Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics and Paralympics was an unsuccessful campaign launched in 1984. It bid ended fourth of seven at the 91st IOC Session on 17 September 1986, who awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics to Albertville, France. The defeat resulted in a replanned bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, which was won by the city.\nHistory.\nPlanning of a Norwegian bid started in 1983, after Juan Antonio Samaranch suggested an Oslo Olympic bid during the successfully staged FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982 and a Swedish bid with Falun and Östersund for the 1988 Winter Olympics had failed.\nA few months earlier already the choice of Lillehammer was proposed by Arne B. Mollén,chairmen of the Norwegian Olympic Committee, immediately after the Swedish failure, stating that Lillehammer was the only Nordic town capable of hosting the event.German IOC member Wolfgang Müller when know the idea immediately contacted Mollén, and they held a meeting on 12 October 1981, where it was agreed that the planning would not yet be launched to the public. The inland districts of Oppland and Hedmark had been experiencing an economic slump, and on 21 August 1981, the Government of Norway had appointed a government committee, led by the politician Odvar Nordli, to look into ways to stimulate the local economy. The committee was presented the plans, and concluded that it would be a suitable way to stimulate the region economy.\nIn a secret meeting with the Lillehammer Executive Council on 22 January 1982, they were informed about the plans, and they decided to create a committee, led by Ole Sjetne, to plan the games. A petition was started in 1982 to stop the town from hosting the games, which gathered about a thousand signatures by 2 June 1982, when the municipal council was to evaluate the planning. The opposition created The Committee For Information About the Olympics in Lillehammer 1992. The municipal committee published a report on 28 January 1983, presenting a draft of the Olympic bidding plans. On 2 June 1983, Lillehammer Municipal Council voted with 42 against 13 to actively support and work for bringing the games to Lillehammer. The Labour Party was split, and both sides promised demonstrations and actions.\nOn 1 October 1983,the limited company Lillehammer-OL 1992 AS was established to make the plans. Its director was Arild Sletten and its chair was Ole Sjetne. Financing for the planning was secured through NOK 15 million from the private sector and NOK 10 million from the public sector. During the 1984 Winter Olympics,held in Sarajevo a public reception was held where Lillehammer's bidding for the 1992 Winter Olympics was launched. A major focus for the committee was to distribute information about Norway and very unknow Lillehammer among IOC members. This action led the visits to the 70 IOC members in their home countries, with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs following up. Representatives attended 37 international sports events. During 1985, a government guarantee was secured, establishing the games' financial foundation. The Information Committee published a white book in 1984, which was critical to both the application process and the impact of the games on the town, warning that the city would change character. Arne Skouen stated that \"[t]he best way to bulldoze over and leave the city behind looking like a battlefield is to organize an Olympics.\"\nIn May 1985, Petter Rønningen took over as director of the company, by which time it had five full-time employees. The final plans were approved by the municipal council on 7 November. The formal bid was three volumes totaling 500-page, presented in English and French. The bid sent a delegation of 58 delegates to the IOC session, which was held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 17 September 1986."

        "text": "Dwight Grant Watson (May 29, 1871 – December 28, 1920) was an American college football player and coach. He was the head football coach at Michigan State Normal College (now known as Eastern Michigan University) during the 1899 college football season. He was also involved in the telephone industry in its early years, serving as manager of the Michigan Telephone Company in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and as the general manager of the Van Buren County Telephone Company in the years prior to his death.\nEarly years.\nWatson was born in 1871 in Geneva Township, Van Buren County, Michigan. His father, Jerome Watson, was a farmer. At the time of the 1880 U.S. Census, he was the seventh of nine children ranging from age 1 to age 26. He became a school teacher, and as of 1894, he was teaching elementary school in Lacota, Michigan.\nCoaching career.\nIn the late 1890s, Watson enrolled at Michigan State Normal College—now known as Eastern Michigan University—in Ypsilanti, Michigan. During the 1899 college football season, he was a player and head coach for the Michigan State Normal Normalites football team. He was a third-year student at the college during his tenure as the football coach. His coaching record at the school was 1–1–1.\nMilitary service.\nWatson served with the 31st Michigan Volunteers Company G in 1898 during the Spanish–American War. He was under the command of former Michigan Normal head football coach and future Governor of Michigan Fred W. Green.\nLater years.\nAfter completing his education at Michigan State Normal College, Watson became employed with Swift &amp; Company in Chicago starting in 1902. In approximately 1903, Watson left his position with Swift &amp; Company and began a long career in the developing telephone industry. He started as a \"trouble shooter\" for the Kibbie Telephone Company in Crawford County, Illinois. He subsequently accepted a position with the Van Buren County Telephone Company, where he was promoted to district manager in Paw Paw, Michigan. At the time of the 1910 U.S. Census, Watson was living in Paw Paw, working as a manager for the phone company. He was married to Pearl A. Watson, and they had one son, F. Stanley Watson, and three daughters, Katherine, Barbara and Virginia.\nIn December 1916, after five years in Paw Paw, Watson became the manager of the Michigan State Telephone Company at Kalamazoo, Michigan. In 1918, Watson returned to the Van Buren County Telephone Company as its general manager. At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Watson was living in South Haven, Michigan, where he was still working as a manager for the phone company. By 1920, his family had grown to six children with two additional daughters, Elizabeth and Marion.\nWatson died in 1920, at age 47, at his home in South Haven following an illness that had lasted for several months."

        "title": "Stony Brook Seawolves men's basketball",
        "text": "The Stony Brook Seawolves men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Stony Brook University. The school competes in the Coastal Athletic Association in NCAA Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The team plays its home games at Island Federal Credit Union Arena, located on the university's campus in Stony Brook, New York. \nStony Brook entered the Division I level in 1999, making the NCAA tournament for the first time in 2016. The team was a member of the America East Conference before moving to the CAA in 2022. Geno Ford has been the team's head coach since 2019.\nThe Seawolves have won four regular season conference championships and have reached the 20-win mark nine times as a Division I program. Stony Brook's official student section is known as \"The Red Zone\" and was voted as the top student section in the America East conference in the 2014 Naismith Student Section of the Year competition. In 2018, Jameel Warney became the first Stony Brook alumnus to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nTeam history.\nPre-Division I era (1960–1999).\nStony Brook University, then the State University College on Long Island, first fielded a basketball program in the 1960–61 basketball season. While first struggling in its initial years with Dan Farrell (1960–64), Stony Brook later enjoyed some success in the Knickerbocker Conference with future NBA coach Herbie Brown (Larry Brown's brother). Brown was Stony Brook's head coach from 1964–69, earning conference Coach of the Year honors following the 1969 season. Hall of Fame coach Rollie Massimino, who later led Villanova to a national championship in 1985, coached Stony Brook from 1969 to 1971. During the 1977–78 season, Stony Brook reached the Final Four of the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament. Coaches Ron Bash, Dick Kendall, and Joe Castiglie helped develop the program in the late 1970s and 1980s, and by the early 1990s, Stony Brook participated in the New York metropolitan-based Skyline Conference.\nUnder President Shirley Strum Kenny, Stony Brook transitioned to the Division I level in the 1990s. The Stony Brook Patriots were renamed to the Seawolves in 1995 and offered scholarships for the first time. The transition period occurred from 1995 to 1999, when head coach Bernard Tomlin led Stony Brook at the Division II level.\nEarly years in Division I, Steve Pikiell takes the helm (1999–2008).\nOn June 10, 1999, Tomlin was reassigned and Stony Brook hired Fordham head coach Nick Macarchuk to begin its tenure in Division I. In 2001, after two years as a Division I independent, the Seawolves joined the America East Conference. Macarchuk retired following the 2004–05 season, going 64–108 in six years, with just one winning season and three 20-loss seasons. Steve Pikiell, a former UConn point guard and recently the associate head coach at George Washington, was hired on April 13, 2005.\nIn May 2005, the NCAA placed Stony Brook on three years' probation, stripping 12.5 scholarships due to eligibility violations. The NCAA Committee of Infractions discovered that 53 athletes in 14 sports from 1999 to 2001 were ineligible to compete due to improper paperwork and lack of academic credit hours. \"There was no evidence that the violations were intentional. Rather, they were the result of a compliance coordinator being overwhelmed with Division I requirements with which he was unfamiliar,\" read the report.\nStony Brook finished in last place during Pikiell's first season with a 4–24 (2–14 AE) record, but his first recruiting class was named 32nd-best in the nation and he was extended through 2010–11 on March 23, 2006. Stony Brook finished last again in 2006–07 and tied for last in 2007–08. In the Seawolves' first seven America East years, they were 55–140 (32–84 AE).\nPikiell brings success (2008–2016).\nIn every season from 2009–10 to 2015–16, Stony Brook either won the America East regular season title or appeared in the America East Finals, but the immense regular season success came with only one America East tournament victory as the Seawolves lost four America East title games in five years.\n2008–09 season.\nIn the 2008–09 season, Pikiell led Stony Brook to their first winning season since joining the America East. The Seawolves finished 16–14 (8–8) and earned a No. 4 seed in the America East championship tournament. However, they suffered an opening-round loss to New Hampshire.\n2009–10 season.\nStony Brook's run of success in the America East began in the 2009–10 season. The Seawolves ended with a 22–10 (13–3) record and won their first America East regular season title in program history. With the No. 1 seed in the America East tournament, the Seawolves beat eighth-seeded Albany 68–59 in the quarterfinals but lost to Boston University 70–63 in the semifinals. Their regular season title earned them an automatic bid to the 2010 NIT, where they hosted and lost to Illinois in the first round. The successful season led to the school's largest broadcasting package, with three games scheduled on the main ESPN channel, two on ESPNU, one on SNY and five on MSG+.\nSenior guard Muhammad El-Amin won America East Player of the Year, the first Stony Brook player to capture the award. El-Amin was the leading scorer on the Seawolves. Steve Pikiell won Coach of the Year, the first Stony Brook coach to earn the honor.\n2010–11 season.\nBefore the season, Tommy Brenton suffered a knee injury that would cost him the entire year. Stony Brook opened at UConn, losing 79–52 loss to Pikiell's former team and the eventual national champions. Stony Brook won their ESPN debut against Monmouth, 51–49. The team earned a No. 5 seed in the America East tournament, defeating fourth-seeded Albany in the quarterfinals 67–61. The Seawolves upset No. 1 seed Vermont in the semifinals, winning 69–47 to advance to the America East Finals for the first time in the program's history. \nHosted at Agganis Arena in Boston, Massachusetts, the Seawolves travelled to face a Boston Terriers team that had defeated them in the playoffs last year. Despite leading by as much as 15 in the second half, the team allowed 14 straight points to John Holland that cut their 41–26 lead to 41–40. With the score tied at 54 with 2.4 seconds left, Holland was fouled and made both free throws as Stony Brook lost 56–54 and their first NCAA tournament bid came up short.\n2011–12 season.\nPrior to the season, the Seawolves played an exhibition tour in Europe against five teams. Stony Brook earned its second America East regular season championship and won 14 games in conference for the first time, one of 13 Division I teams to go undefeated at home. The No. 1 seed in the America East, Stony Brook defeated Binghamton 78–69 and Albany 57–55 on a buzzer-beater tip-in to advance to its second straight conference finals, hosted at Stony Brook for the first time. \nIn front of a sold-out crowd at the Stony Brook Arena, Stony Brook lost 51–43 to Vermont, falling one game short of the NCAA Tournament for a second straight year. Stony Brook earned an automatic bid to the 2012 NIT, losing to top-seeded Seton Hall 63–61. Tommy Brenton won America East Defensive Player of the Year, the first-ever Stony Brook player to do so, while Steve Pikiell won Coach of the Year for the second time.\n2012–13 season.\nStony Brook went 9–4 in non-conference play, losing only to Sacred Heart, UConn, Maryland and Seton Hall. Stony Brook won a second straight regular season title, winning 14 of its last 16 games to enter the postseason. As the No. 1 seed, Stony Brook beat Binghamton 72–49 in the America East quarterfinals but was upset by fourth-seed Albany in the semifinals. Trailing by 10 points with 3:47 left, Stony Brook came back to tie it before Albany hit a layup with 2.4 seconds left for the 61–59 loss. Stony Brook earned an automatic bid to the 2013 NIT, beating UMass 71–58 in the first round for their first-ever NIT victory. In the second round, they lost to Iowa 75–63 to end the season 25–8 (14–2 AE).\nSenior forward Tommy Brenton won America East Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, freshman forward Jameel Warney won Rookie of the Year, and Pikiell won his third Coach of the Year award.\n2013–14 season.\nStony Brook started 8–4 before losing two straight to VCU and Columbia. The Seawolves started 7–0 in conference and ended 13–3, not winning the regular season for the first time since 2010–11. As the No. 2 seed in the America East tournament, they beat Maine 80–54 in the quarterfinals and Hartford 69–64 in the semifinals to reach the America East Finals for the third time in four years. However, for the fifth straight year, Stony Brook's NCAA tournament ambitions were thwarted. Playing against Albany in front of a sold-out crowd at Pritchard Gymnasium, the Seawolves led 52–46 with 7:02 remaining, but the Great Danes roared back and defeated Stony Brook 69–60. Stony Brook received an invite to the 2014 College Basketball Invitational, where they lost to Siena 66–55 in the first round. Stony Brook finished the season with a 23–9 (13–3) record. As a sophomore, Warney won his first America East Player of the Year after ranking top five nationally in field goal percentage and leading Stony Brook in scoring, rebounding, and blocking.\n2014–15 season.\nStony Brook moved back to the newly-renovated Island Federal Credit Union Arena. In the arena's first game, Rayshaun McGrew hit a game-winning layup to beat Columbia 57–56. On December 28, the Seawolves upset No. 13 Washington on the road by a score of 62–57, their second win against a Power 5 conference in program history after beating Penn State in 2006. It was the program's first-ever win against a ranked opponent. The team was second in the America East at 12–4 behind Albany, who was 15–1, the only loss to Stony Brook. Stony Brook beat Binghamton and Vermont to reach its fourth America East finals in five years, still searching for their first NCAA tournament berth.\nFor the second straight year, Stony Brook faced Albany. On the road, Stony Brook led for almost the entire game but collapsed in the waning moments. Albany's Peter Hooley hit a three-pointer with 1.6 seconds to give the Great Danes a 51–50 victory after trailing for the rest of the contest as Albany benefited off of several Stony Brook turnovers and missed free throws. In the 2015 College Basketball Invitational, Stony Brook lost to Mercer 72–70 in the first round. Warney won his second straight America East Player of the Year award, as well as Defensive Player of the Year, after leading the nation with 20 double-doubles and ranking fifth with 11.4 rebounds per game.\n2015–16 season: First NCAA tournament berth.\nStony Brook finished non-conference play with a 9–4 record, winning their final five games. The Seawolves began to garner national attention as they won the first thirteen games of conference play and their winning streak grew to 18 games, at the time the longest active streak in Division I. The streak was snapped on February 17 in an 82–70 loss to Albany that knocked Stony Brook to 22–5. The Seawolves lost the final game of the regular season, their first home loss of the year, to Vermont by a score of 76–62. However, Stony Brook still earned their fourth America East regular season championship in program history.\nStony Brook beat UMBC 86–76 in the quarterfinals and Hartford 80–64 in the semifinals, making their third straight America East Finals and their fifth in six years. Taking on Vermont, it looked as if the Seawolves would miss out yet again as they trailed by 14 points in the second half, but a furious comeback led by Finals MVP Jameel Warney, who scored 43 points, allowed Stony Brook to pull off the 80–74 comeback victory as they earned their first-ever berth to the NCAA tournament.\nAs the No. 13 seed, Stony Brook faced No. 4–seeded Kentucky in the first round and lost 85–57.\nWarney won his third consecutive America East Player of the Year award, averaging a double-double for the second straight season. Warney joined Vermont's Taylor Coppenrath and Northeastern's Reggie Lewis as the only players to win three America East Player of the Year awards. Warney also won Defensive Player of the Year for the second straight year. Pikiell was named Coach of the Year for the fourth time.\nOn March 20, 2016, three days after Stony Brook's NCAA tournament appearance, Pikiell accepted the head coaching job at Rutgers, ending his Seawolves tenure with a 192–157 record in 11 seasons.\nJeff Boals takes over (2016–2019).\nOn April 8, 2016, Stony Brook hired Ohio State assistant Jeff Boals to succeed Pikiell. Picked to finish seventh in the conference preseason poll, Stony Brook finished in second place despite losing its top four scorers from the prior year. Stony Brook beat Binghamton 70–60 in the America East quarterfinals but was upset at home by three-seed Albany in the semifinals, 63–56. \nIn the 2017–18 season, Stony Brook had a losing record in conference play for the first time since 2007–08. On December 22, 2017, Stony Brook upset Pikiell and Rutgers 75–73 in overtime on the road. Stony Brook beat Albany 69–60 in the America East quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Vermont 70–51 in the semifinals. Freshman forward Elijah Olaniyi was named America East Rookie of the Year.\nStony Brook began the 2018–19 season by beating George Washington 77–74 in overtime after trailing 22–0, the largest scoreless comeback in college since 1977. Three days later, Stony Brook beat South Carolina 83–81 for the program's first victory against an SEC team. Stony Brook ended the regular season with a 24–7 record, leading the nation with 13 road wins and earning the No. 2 seed in the America East Playoffs. The Seawolves were upset by Binghamton 78–72 in the quarterfinals, Stony Brook's first quarterfinal loss in a decade. Sophomore center Jeff Otchere was named America East Defensive Player of the Year, and sophomore guard/forward Andrew Garcia won America East Sixth Man of the Year.\nOn March 17, 2019, Boals resigned to accept the head coaching job for the Ohio Bobcats, his alma mater, going 55–41 overall and 33–17 in the America East in three seasons. Geno Ford was promoted from assistant to interim head coach for the 2019 College Basketball Invitational, where the Seawolves blew a 25-point first-half lead against South Florida, ultimately losing 82–79 in overtime.\nThe Geno Ford era (2019–present).\nOn March 26, 2019, Ford's interim tag was removed and he was officially named the fourth head coach in the program's Division I era. In Ford's first season, Stony Brook won 20 games for the eighth time in the last 11 seasons and finished in second place in the America East, their ninth top-2 finish over that time period. After defeating Albany in the America East quarterfinals, Stony Brook was upset 64–58 at home by Hartford in the semifinals to end their season at 20–13. In the offseason, the program lost three stars to Power 5 schools, with Elijah Olaniyi transferring to Miami (FL), Makale Foreman transferring to California and Andrew Garcia transferring to Georgia.\nIn Ford's second season, Stony Brook finished 9–14, their worst record in 13 years. The Seawolves were eliminated in the first round of the America East playoffs after blowing a 16-point second half lead against UMass Lowell. Mouhamadou Gueye was named the America East Defensive Player of the Year. Stony Brook was named preseason favorites ahead of the 2021–22 season, but in February, the America East banned then-second place Stony Brook from participating for the conference championship as a result of the school's impending move to the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). Stony Brook's final America East game after 21 years was a 87–68 win over NJIT on March 1, 2022.\nThe 2022–23 season, Stony Brook's first in the CAA, was marred by several season-ending injuries as the Seawolves finished 11–22. Stony Brook earned a CAA tournament win over North Carolina A&amp;T, 76–61 in the first round, losing to champions Charleston in the quarterfinals. In 2023–24, Stony Brook finished tied for sixth place in its second CAA season. Seeded seventh in the CAA tournament, Stony Brook earned upsets over two-seed Drexel, 91–88 (2OT) in the quarterfinals, and three-seed Hofstra, 63–58 in the semifinals to face top-seed Charleston in the championship game. Up by five at halftime, Stony Brook scored the final nine points in regulation to force overtime but lost 82–79, one win shy of an NCAA tournament bid. Stony Brook was the first seven seed to advance to the CAA Finals since East Carolina in 1993.\nFacilities.\nDuring the earliest years of the program, Stony Brook played at nearby Walt Whitman High School (1960–1962) and Port Jefferson High School (1962–1964). The campus was originally located in Oyster Bay, New York when the school was known as the State University College on Long Island, moving to Stony Brook in 1962. \nPritchard Gymnasium opened in 1964. Stony Brook played there until the opening of the Stony Brook Arena in 1990. In 2008, plans were made to renovate Stony Brook Arena and the Seawolves moved back to Pritchard Gymnasium until 2014. However, Stony Brook's first round NIT game against Illinois in 2010 and America East championship game against Vermont in 2012 were still played in the arena in order to meet minimum seating requirements. During Stony Brook's final three seasons at Pritchard Gymnasium, the Seawolves had a 37–3 record at home.\nThe Stony Brook Arena underwent a $21.1 million renovation from 2012 to 2014, and was renamed the Island Federal Credit Union Arena (now commonly referred to as simply Island Federal Arena) after a $7 million partnership with Island Federal Credit Union. Stony Brook played its first game at the newly-named arena on November 14, 2014, beating Columbia on a last-second layup. The arena seats 4,160. \nTeam.\nRetired numbers.\nOn February 18, 2017, less than a year after his graduation, power forward Jameel Warney's No. 20 was retired in a ceremony. It was the first number to be retired for a Stony Brook basketball player. Warney, a three-time America East Player of the Year, is Stony Brook's all-time leader in career points, rebounds, blocks, and games played. When Warney signed a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks on March 11, 2018, he became the first Stony Brook alum to play in the NBA.\nCoaches.\nHead coaches.\nThe following have been the head coaches of Stony Brook men's basketball since 1960.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Seawolves made their first trip ever to the NCAA tournament in 2016 after winning the conference regular season and tournament championships.

        "text": "The New Mexico Lobos women's basketball team represents the University of New Mexico in the Mountain West Conference in the NCAA Division I. The team is coached by Mike Bradbury.\nCoaching history.\nPre Varsity Eras.\nThe UNM women's basketball team played their first recorded game on December 22, 1898 . It was an intramural game played between teams called the Gladiators and the Olympians; it was an intramural game as both teams were made up of University of New Mexico students. Shortly after this first game was played, the women played the first game in the women's basketball version of what is now known as the Rio Grande Rivalry, as they played Las Cruces College to a 4-2 win at the First Street Armory. After that first season of play, the women's team would late extend invitations to colleges throughout New Mexico; however, in 1912, the UNM faculty refused to allow the women to travel outside of the city.\nIn the 1970s, with the introduction of Title IX, UNM effectively restarted their women's basketball program, with 2 club seasons in 1972-73 and 1973-74. After the 1973-74 season, the University fully established the basketball team as an official interscholastic athletic team.\nKathy Marpe (1974–80).\nHead coach Kathy Marpe compiled a winning record with UNM women's basketball team to a win 78 games and lose 58 (.577). \nDoug Hoselton (1980–87).\nCoach Doug Hoselton compiled a record of 89 wins and 105 (.459). After the 1987 season, facing budget issues, the university shut down the women's basketball program.\nMaureen Eckroth (1991–95).\nMaureen Eckroth had an unfortunate record during the four years as head coach, finishing with 14 wins and 96 losses(.13). \nDon Flanagan (1995–2011).\nDon Flanagan coached the Lobos for 16 seasons, improving the Lobos' record to a remarkable 340–168 (.669). He announced his retirement in April, 2011. \nYvonne Sanchez (2011–2016).\nYvonne Sanchez was named head coach on April 22, 2011 replacing Don Flanagan who had been the head coach for 15 years.\nMike Bradbury (March 2016–present).\nIn March 2016, Mike Bradbury took over as the new women's head basketball coach, after former coach Yvonne Sanchez was fired earlier that month.\nIn 2021, the Lobos won the regular-season Mountain West Conference title, the first time they had done so without sharing the title with another team. Because of public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lobos were able to play only two of their games at their own court, The Pit."

        "title": "Cycling in Amsterdam",
        "text": "Amsterdam is well known as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities, with high levels of bicycle infrastructure, planning and funding, tourism—as well as high levels of bike theft, safety concerns and overcrowding in places.\nThough considered one of the best-known centers of bicycle culture worldwide, numerous other cities in the Netherlands and globally outrank Amsterdam in bike-friendliness, including The Hague, Eindhoven and Almere, which were nominated for the \"Fietsstad 2014\" awards. The city of Groningen won the award in 2001.\nBackground.\nAs is common in Dutch cities, Amsterdam has a wide network of traffic-calmed streets and facilities for cyclists, including bike paths, bike racks, and guarded bicycle parking stations (\"Fietsenstalling\"), the latter available for a fee. According to the most recent figures published by Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2015 the 442,693 households (850,000 residents) in Amsterdam altogether owned 847,000 bicycles—or 1.91 bicycles per household.\nBicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam's small size, the 400 km of bike paths, the flat terrain, and the arguable inconvenience of driving an automobile: driving a car is discouraged, parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way for motor vehicle traffic (but not for cyclists). Amsterdam's bike paths (\"Fietspad\") are red in colour, in order to differentiate them from both the road ways and footpaths.\nAmsterdammers ride a wide variety of bicycles including the traditional \"Omafiets\"—the ubiquitous Dutch roadster with a step-through frame—to anything from modern city bikes, road bikes, mountain bikes, and even recumbent bikes.\nMany tourists get around Amsterdam by bike, following the Dutch custom. Bicycle tour groups offer guided bike tours through the city. Bicycle traffic, in fact traffic in general, is relatively safe: in 2007, Amsterdam had 18 traffic deaths, of all types, in total.\nBike traffic has a 38% modal share.\nBicycle theft in Amsterdam is widespread: in 2005, about 54,000 bicycles were stolen, and every year between 12,000 and 15,000 bicycles are retrieved from the canals.\nHistory.\nAmsterdam has addressed automobile-dependency radically and aggressively, by sharply inhibiting car access and expanding availability and convenience of public transportation ;— while being transparent in its aim to be an eco-friendly city. Roughly, two-thirds of daily urban transportation is by bicycle, while 19 percent is by car. Amsterdam's ultimate goal is to become a car-free and zero-emissions city by making it harder and less convenient to use automobiles. This will be done by making central roads through-routes, using one-way systems, narrowing roads and creating barriers.\nInitiatives are taken by the city of Amsterdam itself, by the alderperson and city hall, encouraging riders to use public transportation by running the Metro on weekends all night and be free for children under the age of 12. Urban planning and smart city planning often face the issue of cost. However, the Netherlands’ government is being cost-efficient by using street-design tool “knip”, making cuts. They are closing roads for cars and opening them to two-wheels and pedestrians, and creating space for sweeping squares, especially around big public spaces like a train station. Also, the city encourages the use of public transportation and drop-off taxis by slowly decreasing the number of parking spots. The government is pushing to reform the use of public transportation and make drivers give up their keys to reduce the number of cars on the roads in Amsterdam, hence reducing the emissions from gasoline. On top of all the efforts done by the legislation, the government is opening their City Data to the public online for free and easy access for its citizens; creating honest transparency with their people. Amsterdam is creating municipal policies under government-citizen transparency to become a smart city and to adapt to the growing urban sprawl happening globally.\nIssues.\nBy 2012, cycling in Amsterdam had grown tremendously in popularity — up by some 40% in the previous twenty years. The city had 490,000 \"fietsers\" (cyclists) take to the road to cycle 2 million kilometres every day according to statistics of the city council. This has caused some problems as, despite 35,000 kilometers of bicycle paths, the country's 18 million bicycles (1.3 per citizen old enough to ride) were clogging Amsterdam's streets at peak times and parked bicycles were overcrowding train stations and other areas. This is being addressed by building even more bike lanes and bicycle parking stations with much greater capacity to tackle a problem many other cities in the world would envy, that of \"bicycle traffic congestion\"."

        "title": "Cycling in Paris",
        "text": "Cycling is a common means of transportation, sport, and recreation in Paris, France. As of 2021, about 15% of trips in the city are made by bicycle, taking place on over of cycling paths. The Tour de France, the largest sporting event in cycling, finishes on the Champs-Élysées. Four major recreational cycling routes—EuroVelo 3, Avenue Verte, the Seine à Vélo, and the Veloscenic—pass by Notre-Dame Cathedral. \nHistory.\nFollowing an accident between a horse-drawn carriage and a velocipede on rue Saint-Antoine, a judgment handed down on May 1869 fined the velocipedist one franc, in accordance with article 113 of the ordinance of 25 July 1862, which banned \"games involving skittles, palets, barrels, etc.\" from the streets. This judgement meant velocipedes were banned from the streets of Paris. The Prefect of Police, Léon Renault, lifted the ban with an ordinance on 9 November 1874 that equated a velocipede with a carriage, and thus required it to be equipped with a lantern, bell and license plate. \nIn 1869, Richard Lesclide, the editor of the Le Vélocipède illustré, organized the world's first city-to-city bicycle road race, from Paris to Rouen. It took place on 7 November 1869 and counted 323 participants. The race was won by James Moore with a time of 10 hours and 45 minutes.\nAfter having nearly disappeared in the 1980s, when cars were 85 times more frequent than cycling, the number of cyclists in Paris has grown since the 1990s.\nCycleways and routes.\nThere are 1,000 km (620 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include \"piste cyclable\" (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and \"bande cyclable\" (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Since 2008, of specially marked bus lanes are also open to cyclists. Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets in 20 mph zones.\nParis' bike routes are detailed in guides such as \"Paris de Poche: Cycliste et Piéton\" (i.e. Pocket Paris: Cyclist and Pedestrian) which costs about €5 or \"Paris à Velo\" (i.e. Paris by bike), available for free from Paris town hall offices.\nVoies vertes.\nSome of the French cycle routes known as \"voies vertes\" (literally \"greenways\") pass through Paris. One is the \"Piste du canal de L'Ourcq\" (the Ourcq canal path) which runs through Paris to Sevran.\nEuroVelo and other international routes.\nThe long-distance cycle path EuroVelo 3 passes through Paris. Dubbed the \"Pilgrim's Route\", it runs between Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Trondheim in Norway.\nOther international routes that pass through Paris include the Avenue Verte route, which runs between Paris and London. The \"Avenue Verte\" crosses the English Channel at Dieppe via the Newhaven – Dieppe ferry.\nVélib'.\nFollowing the successful examples of bicycle hire schemes in the cities of Rennes and Lyon, the city of Paris launched the Vélib' rental bikes system on 15 July 2007. Managed by the company JCDecaux, there were originally 10,648 bikes available at 750 Vélib' stations. More than 20,600 bikes at 1,451 stations are planned for late 2007 and Paris may eventually have 50,000 Vélib' bikes for hire.\nIn 2018, Velib' was rebranded as Vélib' Métropole, and is now operated by Smovengo. The switch between operators was defined by electrical and software issues that lasted for months, leading many users to abandon their memberships and seek reimbursement.\nAs of October 2023, 19,000 Velib' bikes are available (40% of which are electric) and there are 1,464 stations located in Paris and its adjoining suburbs. The service had 390,000 subscribers in 2022. \n\"Paris Respire\".\n\"Paris Respire\" (literally \"Paris Breathes\") is a car-free event where certain roads are closed to vehicular traffic on Sundays and public holidays between the hours of 9am and 5pm. The roads closed are in popular areas such as along the Seine River, in the Marais, the along the Canal Saint Martin and in Montmartre, as well as some other roads elsewhere in the city. Cycling and walking are the main forms of getting around on these roads on these days.\nSports practice.\nIn Paris, there are two tracks where cyclists can practice racing. The first is an oval track of 3.6km located around the Longchamp Racecourse in the 16th district. It has been used by cyclists since the end of the 19th century, when the first cycling competitions began. Today, the track is the most used cycling segment in France on the sport application Strava and one of the most popular in the world. \nThe second place is called the Polygone de Vincennes and it is located in the Bois de Vincennes in the 12th district of Paris. The track was recently refurbished.\nGovernment investment.\n\"Le Plan vélo de Paris\" (2015-2020).\n\"Le Plan vélo de Paris\" (i.e. The Paris Bike Plan) was a 150 million euro investment by the city of Paris that aimed to double the length of bike paths in the city between 2015-2020. \nThe main focus of the plan was to increase the amount of bike paths and parking spots in the city, but the plan also included subsidies for residents to purchase electric bicycles and a focus on increasing opportunities for people to learn how to ride and maintain bikes.\nBicycle counters recorded an average increase in ridership of 47% between 2019 and 2020, and 22% between 2020 and 2021. On some routes, the increase between 2019 and 2020 was as high as 60%. By 2021, Paris had over 1,000km of bike lanes.\n\"Le Plan vélo de Paris\" (2021-2026).\nIn October 2021, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the second act of \"Le Plan vélo de Paris\", which has a budget of 250 million euros and aims to add another 180 km of bike lanes to the city. Her goal is to make Paris \"100% cyclable\". The 180 km of new lanes includes the 50 km (31 mi) of temporary bike lanes that were constructed in Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic that will now be made permanent. The plan also includes the addition of 130,000 new bicycle parking spots.\nSeparately, the national government announced in 2023 that it will spend 2 billion euros on new bicycle infrastructure between 2023-2027. If the spending of local and regional authorities is also taken into account, the amount rises to 6 billion euros during the same time frame."

        "text": "The Guatemala Quetzal Rugby Club (GQRC) is a rugby team based in Guatemala City, Guatemala. They participate in the \"Asociacion Guatemalteca de Rugby\" 15s tournament. The club takes pride in its connection to Guatemala City and the Guatemalan national bird, the Quetzal, which serve as club identifiers. The team is mainly composed of Guatemalan players, representing 95% of the club.\nIn its first two years, the club used Maya numerals on the back of their jerseys to identify a player's position.\nHistory.\nThe Guatemala Quetzal Rugby Club (GQRC) was founded on March 4, 2010, making it the 6th rugby club in the history of Guatemalan rugby. The club was established by a mix of Guatemalans and expatriates with the goal of elevating the level of play in Guatemala through competition in existing tournaments. The first formal training session was held at the Inter-American College of Guatemala on March 20, 2010.\nInitially, the club faced opposition in joining the 2010 tournament due to a file submitted to mediation by another club in Guatemala City, but with the support of other participating clubs and El Salvador's national team (Torogoces), the case was dismissed, allowing GQRC to enter the national competition. The club achieved its first championship title, becoming the first team in Guatemalan rugby history to do so undefeated.\nIn 2011, the club became formally incorporated into the Antigua Guatemalan Rugby Association and commenced training in January of that year. It proved to be a fruitful year for the club, securing a second championship with only one game lost.\nHowever, the club faced administrative changes in 2012, resulting in unfavorable consequences for both sports and administration. As a result, the team did not advance beyond the qualifying stage in the 2012 season. By the last quarter of 2012, a new board of directors was formed to reorganize the club.\nIn 2013, the women's team of Rugby Seven 7s was established, participating in the Women's Major League. They have been undefeated champions since their inception in 2013 and have represented the club in international competitions, achieving first place in the Maquilishuat Cup in El Salvador in 2016 and second place in 2017.\nThe Quetzales Rugby club currently contributes over 60% of players to the female rugby team, representing Guatemala in various international tournaments. Additionally, the men's team of Quetzales has contributed around 40% of players for the rugby men's team. The club has produced five certified referees of different levels, supporting the development of the national rugby league.\nFurthermore, the club has two high-level coaches who have led the Guatemalan team to numerous international championships:\nFor the female branch: Fabrizio Tzorín\nFor the male branch in 15s mode: Jorge Montenegro\nFounders of the club.\nThe founders of the club are as follows:\nHonors.\nMale Team:\nFemale Team:\nSponsorship.\nThe primary sponsor of GQRC is Rattle'n Hum Bar of Guatemala City, which also serves as the team's clubhouse. Colegio Interamericano supports the team by providing the use of their secure training area. WorldGym Guatemala is the club's official gym.\nRecruiting.\nGQRC promotes the sport of rugby in Guatemala by engaging with local schools, embassies, and volunteer work to seek out new players. Additionally, the club organizes rugby clinics to further promote the sport."

        "text": "Scott MacKenzie (born 21 February 1972) is a retired Brazilian-born British professional darts player based in Hong Kong. He has represented Hong Kong on numerous occasions (in both steel tip and soft tip darts), including captaining the Hong Kong team at the 2008 Asia Pacific Cup in New Zealand and 2012 team to Australia. He was also a member of the 2010 and 2016 Asia Pacific Cup teams. He has played in a total of 3 PDC World Championships and 3 PDC World Cups currently more than any other Hong Kong darts player.\nCareer.\nMacKenzie won the PDC Greater China Qualifier, defeating Alex Hon in the final, to qualify for the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship. He became the first player from Hong Kong to qualify for a World Darts Championship. He played Germany's Jyhan Artut in the preliminary round, and missed two darts to win the match before losing 3-4.\nMacKenzie qualified for his second successive PDC World Championship in 2012 after defeating Royden Lam in the PDC Greater China Qualifier final. He beat Paul Barham 4-2 in the best of seven legs preliminary round match to make it through to the last 64 for the first time. He played former World quarter-finalist, Wayne Jones, and was beaten 1-3. In the rest of 2012 he lost in the quarter-finals of the Pacific Masters to Tony Carmichael and was also defeated in the semi-finals of the WDF Asia-Pacific Cup and Hong Kong Open. He entered the PDC Qualifying School in an attempt to win a 2-year tour card but could not finish in the top 4 on any of the four days, but finished high enough in the rankings to eventually play in the pro tour events during that year.\nMacKenzie made his debut in the World Cup of Darts in June 2014 where he represented Hong Kong with Royden Lam, they have played in a total of 3 PDC World Cups together. They defeated Norway 5–2 in the first round in 2014 to face Australia in the second round. Lam lost his singles match against Simon Whitlock, before MacKenzie saw off Paul Nicholson to mean a doubles match was required to settle the tie, which Hong Kong were whitewashed in 4–0.\nMackenzie qualified for his 3rd PDC World Championship in 2015 where MacKenzie reached the final of the 2015 World Championship PDPA qualifier and lost 5–2 to Jason Hogg. However, it was enough to earn him a spot in the preliminary round of the event where he raced into a 3–0 lead over Daryl Gurney and missed one dart to win 4–0. Gurney levelled the match at 3–3, before MacKenzie missed a dart at double 11 to complete a 142 finish and was defeated 4–3. MacKenzie and Lam caused a couple of shocks at the World Cup. First they defeated Wales' Mark Webster and Jamie Lewis 5–3. Lam then beat Ireland's William O'Connor 4–1, but MacKenzie missed six match darts against Connie Finnan from 3–0 up to lose 4–3 meaning a doubles match was needed to settle the tie. It went to the final leg in which MacKenzie finished 86 to send Hong Kong into the quarter-finals. However, number two seeds Scotland proved to be too much as Gary Anderson and Peter Wright won both their singles matches 4–2 to eliminate Hong Kong. MacKenzie claimed the 2015 Hong Kong Open by beating Alex Hon. Mackenzie and Lam represented Hong Kong for a third successive time at the PDC World Cup in 2016 where again they played Ireland, a team consisting of William O'Connor and Mick McGowan, and they eventually lost 5–4 in the first round.\nMackenzie has stated he has suffered from dartitis since the middle of 2014 which has greatly affected his form and results, but has managed to keep it at bay to a certain extent.\nPersonal life.\nMacKenzie was born in São Paulo to a Japanese-Brazilian mother and a Scottish father. After spending the first six years of his life in Brazil, MacKenzie and his family relocated to the UK. He moved to Hong Kong in 1996.\nHe obtained a BSc followed by a MSc in Chemistry whilst studying at the University of Kent. He was sponsored by Puma darts and has also recently been sponsored by Dartslive, DMC Darts and L-style. When not playing darts, he is an investor relations manager for a hedge fund. He is a fan of conspiracy theories associated with David Icke and often uses flights as well as wearing a sponsorship patch with DavidIcke.com written on during tournaments as free advertising."

        "title": "Cape Bowling Green Light",
        "text": "Cape Bowling Green Light is an active lighthouse on Cape Bowling Green, a long headland ending in a long low sandspit, about from Ayr, Queensland, Australia. The lighthouse is at the end of the headland, near the base of the sandspit. The first lighthouse at the location, established in 1874, was moved multiple times. It was prefabricated in Brisbane, shipped to the location, moved twice due to coastal erosion and finally transferred for display at the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour in Sydney.\nHistory.\nMany ships wrecking at Cape Bowling Green necessitated the construction of a lighthouse at the cape. The first Cape Bowling Green Light was constructed in 1874, one of 22 lighthouses of a similar design constructed in Queensland around that time. It was a round conical tower, constructed of local hardwood frame clad with galvanized iron plates imported from Britain. The lighthouse was prefabricated in Brisbane, then dismantled and shipped to the location to be erected again. The construction was done by the brothers John and Jacob Rooney of Maryborough, which also constructed Sandy Cape Light, Cowan Cowan Point Light, Cape Capricorn Light, Lady Elliot Island Light and Booby Island Light.\nThe original lens was a 3rd order Chance Brothers dioptric lens, and the light source was a kerosene wick lamp with an intensity of 13,000 cd, visible for . The apparatus was rotated with a clockwork mechanism and the station was operated by four lighthouse keepers, a chief and three assistants.\nIn 1878 beach erosion threatened the lighthouse for the first time and it was moved for the first time. In 1908 the tower had to be relocated further away for the same reason.\nIn 1913 an incandescent gas mantle operated by vaporised kerosene was installed, raising the power to 64,000 cd. In 1920 a fixed automatic acetylene gas lamp (carbide lamp) with a sun valve was installed. As a result, the lighthouse was demanned and all other buildings were demolished.\nIn 1985 a racon was installed. In 1987 the lighthouse was replaced by the current skeletal tower. With the sponsorship of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the lighthouse was dismantled, and sections were lifted by a Department of Transport helicopter to a site where they were numbered, crated, and shipped to Sydney. By 1994 the lighthouse was reassembled at the Australian National Maritime Museum where it is now on display. The lighthouse is still operational, using the original 3rd order lens and a typical 1913 clockwork mechanism, and it maintains its original light characteristic, four white flashes every twenty seconds (Fl.(4)W. 20s).\nCurrent structure and display.\nThe current tower is a square steel skeletal tower. It is topped by a square lantern structure with a gallery. It is painted white with a red horizontal band at the top.\nThe light characteristic shown is four white flashes every twenty seconds (Fl.(4)W. 20s), visible for .\nSite operation and visiting.\nThe current lighthouse is operated by the AMSA. The visiting status is unclear. The original lighthouse is owned and operated by the Australian National Maritime Museum, and it is open for guided tours daily."

        "title": "USA Rugby League",
        "text": "The USA Rugby League (formally the US Association of Rugby League, Inc.) is the national governing body for rugby league in the United States.\nThe organization is responsible for running the domestic club competitions and the United States national rugby league team in addition to other responsibilities.\nThe body was founded in 2011 by clubs that had broken from the established American National Rugby League (AMNRL), plus expansion franchises. The USARL began its inaugural competition season in 2011 with eight teams.\nThe USARL was granted affiliate membership in November 2014 of the RLIF and RLEF, replacing the AMNRL which is now defunct.\nHistory.\n2011–2013: Formation after schism with AMNRL.\nThe formation of the USA Rugby League was announced on January 12, 2011. Seven teams that had previously competed in the American National Rugby League, the United States' established rugby league organization and recognized governing body for the sport, announced they were breaking with the AMNRL to form a new league. The stated reason for the split was dissatisfaction with the governance of the AMNRL; the departing teams were unhappy with the lack of club involvement in the league's decision making, and the new league was founded with the principle of including its member clubs in its administration.\nThe departing AMNRL teams were the Boston Thirteens, the Washington, D.C. Slayers, the Fairfax Eagles, the Jacksonville Axemen, the New Haven Warriors, the Philadelphia Fight, and the Pittsburgh Vipers; they were to be joined by two new teams, the New Jersey Turnpike Titans and Kodiak Rugby from New York City. Before the season Pittsburgh and Fairfax became \"developmental\" teams in the new league outside of the top-tiered competition; Fairfax subsequently suspended operations. The New York team was unable to find a suitable stadium in the city, and instead became the Rhode Island Rebellion. One additional team, Oneida FC, joined the top-tiered competition for the 2011 season.\nOn January 13, 2011, the USARL announced that Peter Illfield, chairman of the Philadelphia Fight, would be the league's first chairman. The league's first event was a rugby league nines tournament in the Philadelphia area on May 28–29, 2011. Round 1 of the regular season championship kicked off on June 4; the Jacksonville Axemen won the minor premiership with the best regular season record. In the inaugural Grand Final on August 27, the Philadelphia Fight defeated the New Haven Warriors to win their first ever national championship.\nIn 2013 the USARL and AMNRL increased their focus on reunification, particularly after the United States' encouraging showing at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. An independent commission assembled to lead negotiations, however the USARL clubs eventually pulled out. USARL commissioner Peter Illfield blamed apparent dysfunction and disorganization in the AMNRL organization for this decision. The USARL subsequently invited AMNRL clubs to join their ranks as full members and initiated a four-team expansion.\n2014: NMNRL collapse.\nIn 2014, the USARL expanded to 10 teams, adding expansion squads Atlanta Rhinos, Central Florida Warriors, and Tampa Mayhem. In addition, the Northern Virginia Eagles withdrew from the AMNRL and joined the USARL. To reduce operating costs, the competition was split into two conferences. Meanwhile, the AMNRL suspended its 2014 season.\n2014–2020: Expansion.\nIn 2015, three former AMNRL clubs joined the USARL; Bucks County Sharks, Connecticut Wildcats, and New York Knights. The Delaware Black Foxes also joined as an expansion squad. For 2016, the Connecticut Wildcats left the competition and were replaced by the White Plains Wombats. Before the 2017 season, the D.C. Slayers and Bucks County Sharks left the competition, and the USARL abolished the division structure within the North Conference. Before the 2018 season, the Central Florida Warriors left the competition and were replaced by Southwest Florida Copperheads and Danny Hanson was appointed the second league chairman. The Rhode Island Rebellion also left the competition. The New York Knights left the competition after the 2018 season.\n2021–2022: COVID-19 pandemic and NARL breakaway league.\nUSARL membership has been in flux since the announcement of the North American Rugby League in spring 2021. Boston 13s and Philadelphia Fight left USARL to be founding members of the new competition. White Plains folded after NARL established the New York Freedom. Northern Virginia folded after most of its players joined the newly established DC Cavalry in NARL. Lakeland Renegades suspended operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe 2021 USARL season was contested by six teams. Philadelphia and Delaware in the North; Tampa, Jacksonville, Southwest Florida Copperheads, and South Florida Speed in the South. USARL South Championships Tampa Mayhem defeated North winners Delaware Black Foxes in the championship. The North Division has been unable to play in 2022. Multiple forfeits by South Florida Speed in July 2022 have put their future with USARL in doubt.\n2023–present: Restructure, Women's and Youth focus, and expansion following NARL failure.\n2023 has seen significant expansion. Atlanta Rhinos rejoined the USARL, playing in the South Division. Pacific Coast Rugby League (PCRL) joined USARL, operating on the West Coast. PCRL brought Los Angeles Mongrel, San Diego Barracudas, and Santa Rosa Dead Pelicans – all formerly part of California Rugby League – as well as the newly formerly Los Angeles Bandidos into USARL. Additionally, four Utah teams, Riverton Seagulls, Herriman Roosters, Glendale Storm and Provo Broncos began playing USARL sanctioned matches as affiliates of PCRL. In August 2023, the first ever coast to coast National Champion was crowned with Santa Rosa Dead Pelicans defeating defending champions Jacksonville Axemen, 20–16.\nIn late December of 2023, the USARL announced the introduction of Women's National Competition or the Women's Championship for 2024. 6 clubs from both coasts, Los Angeles Mongrel, San Diego Barracudas, and Santa Rosa Dead Pelicans joined to represent the Western Conference, while Carolina Valkyries, Tampa Mischief, Jacksonville Axewomen and New York State Queens to represent the Eastern Conference. The winner of each conference would face off to crown the National Women's Champion. In 2024, the governing body also announced the beginning of Youth Hawks, the Under 20 national team. This is first time since the late 1990s that a USA youth rugby league team will be put together.\nIn late April of 2024, the USARL announced a new Regionalized structure to the national league. The Utah Rugby League Association would now operate as an independent entity distinct from the Pacific Coast Rugby League, managing its competition in accordance with USARL standards. At the end of the season, URLA and PCRL winners will play for the Western Championship, with the winner facing the Eastern Champions for the National Championship. Secondly, the unification effort on the East Coast of the United States sees the return of Boston 13s, Brooklyn Kings, and Delaware Black Foxes with DC Cavalry joining as the Rugby League United competition becomes the Northeastern conference of USARL. Lastly, the USARL South would now become the Florida Rugby League, the rebranding affects both men's and women's teams in the region, including the Jacksonville Axemen and Axewomen, Southwest FL Copperheads, Tampa Mayhem and Mischief, and the Atlanta Rhinos.\nDomestic competition.\nStructure.\n2024–Present.\nStaring in 2024, the USARL competition was expanded following teams withdrawing for the NARL in the years previous. The competition would be structured into four regional leagues across an East and West Conference. Winners of each league advance to the their respective conference final before the winners of each facing each other in the Grand Final.\n2014–2023.\nBetween 2014 and 2023 the USARL competition was split a Northern and Southern Conference with the top four teams advancing to their conference semi-final. Winners of each conference final would contest the Grand Final.\nCalifornia Rugby League (now Pacific Coast Rugby League) was established in 2018 but was not intergrated into the USARL competition until 2024.\n2011–2013.\nIn the first three seasons of the league, clubs were only present in the North East thus only one geographic group was required. The top four teams advanced to the playoffs ending with the Grand Final.\nDevelopment programs.\nAs part of the 2011 season, a former AMNRL team, the Pittsburgh Sledgehammers, participated as a \"developmental team\", playing a more limited schedule while developing the club for future seasons.\nRepresentative sides.\nNational team\nNew England Immortals\nThe New England Immortals RLFC were founded in 2010 and consisted of the top players from the 3 New England based AMNRL clubs. They played their inaugural match against the Canadian National Team, on July 31, 2010, defeating the Canadians 12–8 in a tightly contested match. After the AMNRL/USARL split in 2011, the Immortals were transferred to the USARL and became the only form of representation for USARL clubs due to the RLIF regulation that USARL-based players could not represent the Tomahawks. The Immortals took to the field for their second match since their inception, and despite putting up a hard fight, they were out classed by the more experienced Marines, losing by a score of 68–12. As of 2014, due to budgetary cuts and restructuring of the USARL competition, the Immortals have not played a match since their loss to the Royal Marines.\nUSA Pioneers\nIn 2014, the league established a touring developmental side, the USA Pioneers, to play friendly matches against foreign nations. They completed a two match tour in Jamaica in April 2014, winning their first game against a Jamaican domestic outfit, but fell short to the semi-professional Hurricanes Rugby League whilst still proving to be strong opposition for the Jamaicans. The Pioneers played a friendly against a touring New Zealand Police squad the following August, losing 6–62 against very strong opposition.\nPresidents Barbarians\nThe USARL established another team to play a second match against the New Zealand Police and to 'curtain-raise' the 2014 USARL National Championship between the Philadelphia Fight and the Jacksonville Axemen. This representative consisted of overseas-imports from Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and France; similar to Super League's Exiles. They were beaten by the Kiwis 16–46."

        "text": "The 2022 Asian Games (), officially the 19th Asian Games () and also known as Hangzhou 2022 (), was a continental multi-sport event which was held from 23 September to 8 October 2023 in Hangzhou, China. The games marked the 110th anniversary since the creation of the first continental event, starting with the 1913 Far Eastern Championship Games. The games were hailed as an incredible success by numerous officials from the Olympic Council of Asia and Asian Paralympic Committee.\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 10 to 25 September 2022, on 6 May 2022 the Games were postponed to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new dates were announced on 19 July 2022. Hangzhou was the third Chinese city to host the Asian Games, after Beijing in 1990 and Guangzhou in 2010. \nBidding process.\nThe Chinese Olympic Committee confirmed that Hangzhou in Zhejiang province submitted a proposal to apply for the event and was the only city to complete all necessary steps to participate in the process who ended on end of August 2015. Hangzhou was officially awarded as the host city on 16 September 2015 in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, during the 34th OCA General Assembly.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe emblem of the Games, \"Surging Tides\" (), was unveiled during a ceremony at the headquarters of the Hangzhou Culture Radio Television Group on 6 August 2018; it is designed to resemble a traditional hand fan from Zheijang, a running track, the Qiantang River tidal bore , and radio waves (symbolising wireless connectivity). The organising committee stated that the emblem was meant to reflect \"the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics gathering momentum in the new era\", and \"the unity, solidarity and development of the OCA.\"\nMascot.\nThe three mascots of the Games, Congcong (琮琮), Lianlian (莲莲) and Chenchen (宸宸), known collectively as the \"Memories of Jiangnan\" (, Jiangnan refers to roughly China's eastern regions south of the Yangtze River) whose name derives from the Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi's famous sentence \"When I recall Jiangnan, Hangzhou brings back most of my memories.\" () were unveiled on 3 April 2020. They are depicted as robotic superheroes originating from the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City, the West Lake and the Grand Canal respectively.\nCongcong derives its name from the Cong jade pendant unearthed from the Archeological Ruins. Its body is coloured yellow, representing earth and bumper harvest and its head resembles mythical beast facial patterns. It is described as determined, sincere, kind-hearted, athletic and passionate.\nLianlian derives its name from the lotus leaves in the West Lake. Its body is coloured green, representing life and nature and its head resembles lotus leaf decorated with the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, a scenic view of the West Lake, and the icon of Internet. It is described as pure, kind, lively, cute, elegant and hospitable.\nChenchen derives its name from the Gongchen Bridge, a landmark structure in the Hangzhou section of the Grand Canal. Its body is coloured blue, representing science and technology and its head resembles Qiantang River's tide with Gongchen Bridge. It is described as brave, intelligent, optimistic and enterprising.\nMotto.\nThe official motto of the 2022 Asian Games, \"Heart to Heart, @Future\" was announced on 15 December 2019 to mark 1,000 days before the opening ceremonies. The motto is intended to symbolise the connectivity that the Asian Games create between the countries of Asia.\nMedals.\nOn 15 June 2023, the 100-day countdown to the 19th Asian Games, the medal design named \"Shan Shui\" () was released. Its design was inspired by Jade Cong in the Liangzhu Culture. The obverse featured the Games edition logo, misty hills, the city, a rippling lake and undulating mountains, while the reverse featured the Asian Games Sun Emblem and the name of the event in Chinese and English.\nDuring the medal ceremonies, medalists were also presented bouquets named \"Fruits of Triumph\" (), which consisted of five flowers – rice ears, lotus seedpods, moth orchids (\"Phalaenopsis\"), Longjing tea branches and sweet osmanthus branches arranged in a vase inspired by a huagu, a long-stemmed, broad-lipped vessel produced in the Southern Song (1127-1279) Imperial Kiln. The vase itself is made of wood and crafted using Dongyang wood carving techniques, one of the nation's intangible cultural heritage. Its mouth is decorated with wave patterns resembling rivers and mountains of Zhejiang Province and the Games' mascots.\nMusic.\nThe official theme song of the Games, \"With You and Me\", was released along with its music video on April 27, 2023. It is performed by Angela Zhang, Jackson Wang, Sunnee and JC-T. The song was selected through a global song contest and was originally created by a production team from Thailand, Nadao Music. The original title of the song is \"Let's Celebrate\" or \"เพื่อนกัน (Puean Kan)\" in Thai and was sung by Ice Paris, Billkin, PP Krit and Nana Sawanya.\nAsian Games-themed train.\nOn 16 May 2023, the train number 19045 of Hangzhou Metro Line 19 named Asian Games () started operation. The train displays the Hangzhou Asian Games Logo at the front of the train, and the whole train as well as seats and handrails are colored in purple. This is also the only train in this line that provides OLED start train window system. These Asian Games elements are permanent. Besides, in Hangzhou Metro, Line 1, Line 2, Line 4 and Line 5 will also provide Asian Games-themed trains.\nIn July 2023, the Asian Games-themed Fuxing train came into appearance. The train is themed Runze Jiangnan (), using the purple as main color, painting slogans, motto and logos of Hangzhou Asian Games. During the Asian Games, the train will provide operation services between Hangzhou and Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing and Huzhou.\nOn 1 August 2023, the \"Jincai\" Asian Games themed train of Jinhua Rail Transit started at Jinhua Railway Station.\nOn 26 August 2023, the Asian Games train of Wenzhou Rail Transit Line S1 started operation, which is in purple as the main color, with Asian Games elements including mottos and slogans.\nLook of the Games.\nOn 21 October 2020, the core graphics and colour system were announced as part of the 2022 Asian Games branding, respectively themed as \"Meeting the World\" () and \"Harmony of Colours\" (). The core graphics draw inspiration from silk, one of the main cultural elements of Hangzhou as key linking point on the Maritime Silk Road. The colour system consists of six colours – \"Rainbow Purple\", \"Glowing Red\", \"Mist White\", \"Laurus Yellow\", \"Glimmering Blue\", and \"Lake-and-Mountain Green\", which represent Hangzhou as a livable city of pellucid waters and lush mountains, and a vibrant city embracing innovation and sports. It is inspired by lines from one of China's most famous poet Su Shi from Song dynasty, \"If the West Lake was the Great Beauty, she would look beautiful whether in light or heavy make-up\" ().\nTorch relay.\nOn 10 September 2021, the final torch design of the 2022 Asian Games called \"Eternal Flame\" () was unveiled. It has an overall height of 730 millimetres and a net weight of 1.2 kilograms. The torch base resembles eight water veins, which symbolising the evolution of civilisation and representing the eight major river systems in Zhejiang, the torch body features naturally intertwined dermatoglyphic fingerprint patterns specific to the Liangzhu Culture, the torch head resembles Jade Cong, while the burner nozzle resembles the earliest oracle bone inscription of the Chinese character \"琮\" (Cong). The overall body design made up of profile curve resembles firewood in hand.\nThe flame was lit in the Archaeological site of Liangzhu on 15 June 2023 and reproduced their rites. The physical torch relay started on 8 September 2023 at West Lake, and traveled across 11 prefectures covering 1.507,10 km across Zhejiang province.\n A digital torch relay programme, the first of its kind in the history of the Games, was launched globally on 27 November 2022 and began the same day as the actual torch relay.\nVenues.\n44 venues will be used for the Games, including 30 existing facilities and 14 newly constructed venues. Of these 44 venues, 30 are within Hangzhou and its districts, while other 14 are in four neighbouring prefectures:Deqing, Jinhua, Ningbo, Shaoxing and Wenzhou. A new high-speed rail line was constructed between Hangzhou and Huzhou for the Games.\nCeremonies.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 September 2023 evening in Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium in Hangzhou, China. The ceremony was directed by Sha Xiaolan, one of assistant directors of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. It was attended by the Chinese President Xi Jinping, some Asian foreign leaders including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony was held on 8 October 2023 in Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Aichi Prefecture,in Japan as hosts of next edition in 2026.\nThe Games.\nSports.\nOn 8 April 2019, the Olympic Council of Asia initially announced that the Games would feature 37 sports, including the 28 \"core\" Olympic sports to be contested at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, as well as events in other non-Olympic sports. This led to the addition of events such as open-water swimming and the groups competition in rhythmic gymnastics.\nOn 12 September 2019, baseball, softball, karate, and sport climbing (which were optional events at the then-upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics) were added to the programme. On 18 December 2020, it was announced that esports (which was held as a demonstration event in 2018) and breakdancing (which will debut at the 2024 Summer Olympics) would be added, expanding the Games to 61 disciplines in 40 sports.\nThe esports programme at the 2022 Asian Games will include seven medal events, and two demonstration events in robotics and virtual reality. Competitions will be held in \"Arena of Valor\", \"Dota 2\", \"Dream of the Three Kingdoms 2,\" \"EA Sports FC Online\", \"League of Legends\", \"PUBG Mobile\", and \"Street Fighter V\". \"Hearthstone\" was originally to be included, but was dropped from the programme after NetEase ended its licensing agreement in China with Blizzard Entertainment at the beginning of 2023.\nChanges compared to 2018:\n61 Sport disciplines divided to 4 groups:\nMedal table.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below.\nParticipation.\nAll 45 National Olympic Committees who are members of the Olympic Council of Asia are expected to send delegations. In March 2019, the OCA announced plans to invite athletes from countries from Oceania to compete in selected events; this would mark their first participation in the Summer Asian Games, after having participated for the first time overall at the 2017 Asian Winter Games, albeit as \"guests\" ineligible to receive medals.\nIn November 2021, it was announced that athletes from Oceania would be invited to compete in athletics, triathlon, roller skating, weightlifting, and wushu. Athletes were to receive \"honorary medals\" which would not be counted on the official medal tally. The plan was shelved due to a lack of interest from the relevant federations in Australia and New Zealand.\nOn 26 January 2023, the OCA offered the possibility to Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in the Asian Games, but athletes from the two nations should compete to qualify at the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, Russia and Belarus will still be under the sanctions placed by OCA, and is also in analysis whether their entries will or not impact the Asian Games' outcome.\nOn 8 July 2023, OCA permitted as many as 500 athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under the neutral ground without affecting the medal tally, with the decision supported by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). However, Russian Olympic Committee President cast doubt about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes as invitation was not received. On 2 September, Russia and Belarus were confirmed not to participate in the 2022 Asian Games due to \"technical reasons\", claimed IOC.\nSri Lanka Rugby was suspended by the World Rugby Council due to alleged political interference, causing the Sri Lanka rugby team to be barred from competing under the Sri Lanka national flag and anthem. The team competed under the Olympic Council of Asia flag and anthem, using the country code \"OCA\". In official Games material, the team is listed separately from Sri Lanka, with the designation \"Independent Athlete Participating Under OCA Flag\" (in all caps) in place of a country name. The team opted out of the opening ceremony.\nAfghanistan participated as the \"de jure\" Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. An all-male group of athletes arrived from within Afghanistan, while the extant Afghanistan NOC sent another group of athletes from three countries (Iran, Australia, and Italy) including 17 women.\nSource:\nBroadcasting.\nOn 25 January 2022, during the first Games World Broadcasters Meeting held in the host city, Chinese state broadcaster China Media Group (CMG) undertook the role as the event's host broadcaster. The International Broadcast Centre would be constructed at the Hangzhou International Expo Centre.\nConcerns and controversies.\nOn 18 September 2023, air raid sirens rang out in various regions across China to commemorate the Mukden Incident. Hangzhou used to sound air raid sirens every 18 September, but the practice was suspended this year. This has led to speculation that the decision was made to protect foreigners' feelings, which has sparked dissatisfaction and criticism on Chinese social media.\nChina issued stapled visas instead of stamped ones to three Indian wushu athletes from Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of its Tibet Autonomous Region, while India administers the state as part of its territory. The issuance of stapled visas has been seen as China's way of questioning India's sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh. India protested China's decision, and cancelled its sports minister's visit to the games.\nNorth Korea was under WADA sanctions disallowing its flag from being used, but OCA allowed the North Korean flag to be officially used anyway. WADA sent an official warning to OCA over the incident, and later fined the OCA $500,000 (USD).\nTen athletes competing at the games failed their doping tests.\nEvaluation.\nHailed as \"one of the best ever\", the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou has been highly praised.\n\"Technically, we have had one of the best Asian Games ever. The standard of the Games has been very, very high,\" said Vinod Kumar Tiwari, acting director general of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).\nChen said the Asiad has also perfectly combined art and technology, showcasing the beauty of Hangzhou's landscapes and technological confidence to the world.\n\"Middle East News\" stated that Farman, director of the Asian Games Department of the Olympic Council of Asia, believes that the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou, China will be inspiring. Farman said at the Asian Games Technical Congress held in Hangzhou recently, \"This is the first Asian Games after the COVID-19 pandemic, so it will play a unique, inspiring and important role for the Asian people.\"\nThe Associated Press report pointed out that the Hangzhou Asian Games attracted more athletes than the Olympic Games, and its scale is unparalleled.\nAsian Para Games.\n\"Hangzhou is a very friendly city for people with disabilities.\" Majid Rashid, chairman of the Asian Paralympic Committee, said that the level of civilization in this city can be felt from the service details of the games and the spirit of the citizens.\nDevelopment has speed and warmth. In recent years, Hangzhou has upgraded 140,000 barrier-free points and important public places, set up 380 sign language barrier-free service points, and launched hundreds of barrier-free cruising taxis.\nNew breakthroughs have been achieved in the development of sports for people with disabilities, basic livelihood protection for people with disabilities has reached a new level, public services for people with disabilities have been improved, a social environment friendly to people with disabilities has taken on a new look, and new progress has been made in the exploration and practice of helping people with disabilities and sharing prosperity. He said that in the next step, Zhejiang Province will focus on “splendid hosting of games, brilliant participation in participation, and brilliant undertakings”, make full use of the valuable achievements left by the Hangzhou Asian Para Games, actively plan and continue to strive, and continue to create a happier and better place for people with disabilities life.\nSha Xiaolan, chief director of the closing ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Para Games, said at a media briefing on the preparations for the closing ceremony on the 26th that the closing ceremony of the Asian Para Games will have the theme of \"Flying on Dreams to Meet Again\", with \"Farewell Tonight\" and \" The three performance chapters of \"Tea for a Long Journey\" and \"The Most Reminiscent of Hangzhou\" and the three short films \"You are the Most Wonderful\", \"Tea for a Long Journey\" and \"You are the Most Unforgettable\" are narrated through the three key words of etiquette, rhyme and emotion. Showing the memory of Hangzhou, China's heart and friendship with Asia.\nLv Yuan, chief writer of the closing ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Para Games, said that if the opening ceremony of the Asian Para Games is the affection of a golden osmanthus, the closing ceremony is a farewell feast. “We bid farewell with poems and paintings, and offered tea. Farewell, Jingui farewell. The closing ceremony of the Asian Paralympic Games is the moment for Hangzhou to officially say goodbye to this Asian Games journey. It also means the official ending of the \"two Asian Games\". We look forward to the closing ceremony of the Asian Paralympic Games as an important part of this international event. The event and cultural event will come to a successful conclusion.\""

        "title": "Doris (sailing yacht)",
        "text": "Doris is a sailing yacht, which has also been known as Astarte, Huntress and Vayu, in Deep River, Connecticut that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. She was designed by Nathanael Herreshoff, who designed five America's Cup defender yachts and who also was the main architect of the America's Cup rule change called the Universal Rule. That rule allowed for displacement as well as length and sail area to be included in a formula defining yacht eligibility, and enabled more \"sea-kindly\" and roomier yachts to be competitive. The vessel known as Doris was constructed with a primary emphasis on speed and novelty, representing an avant-garde design that was highly appreciated in her era. She participated in a plethora of prestigious regattas and races, including the Annual Cruise of the New York Yacht Club and the Newport-Bermuda Race, showcasing her remarkable agility and endurance.\nAs the years went by, Doris was passed from owner to owner, each making alterations and updates to the vessel in various ways. In 1984, her tremendous contributions to the world of yachting were recognized when she was inscribed into the National Register of Historic Places. Doris remains an exceptional and precious manifestation of the Herreshoff's oeuvre, and she is adored by sailing enthusiasts and historians worldwide. Previously, America Cup racers were often \"either sleek and fast, but had unseaworthy characteristics, or scow-like vessels which were cumbersome but safe and able passage-makers.\" \"Doris\" is believed to be the largest Herreshoff-designed sloop that was built and has survived. She is said to be the first boat built under the Universal Rule.\nBuilt in Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1905, by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Co., \"Doris\" is the largest all-wood vessel ever built by the firm. The ship was commissioned by S. Reed Anthony, a founding partner of investment banking firm Tucker, Anthony &amp; Co., who paid $18,000. She soon proved her worth, as \"Doris\" \"... proved to be a sensation in the yachting world when she defeated \"Gloriana\", an earlier Herreshoff design built in 1891 and reported to be the fastest sailing vessel of her day, in a series of match races off Marblehead, Massachusetts.\" The ship is also unusual for two construction details. Herreshoff employed metal hanging knees instead of the more traditional sheer clamp, and \"Doris\" is the only boat to possess what Herreshoff called \"belt\" or \"web frames\", whereby oak frames were bent \"over the ceiling\".\nAlthough originally rigged as a gaff-sloop / cutter, the rigging was changed prior to the 1932 Bermuda Race. This proved to be advantageous, as the yacht led the race \"for a good part of the race before light winds gave favor to the smaller vessels.\" In 1934, under the ownership of Lawrence Lowell Reeve, she was converted to a Marconi-ketch.\nOver the years \"Doris\" has gone under a number of names. Under Lawrence Reeve she was referred to as \"Astarte\" from 1934. She was renamed \"Huntress\" in 1937 under new owners, and became \"Vayu\" when purchased by Richard Hart in 1940. James Mercanti purchased \"Vayu\" from Frederic B. Smith of Winthrop, Massachusetts. The ship remained as \"Vayu\" under the next owner, Jim Mercanti, who had the boat between 1957 and 1975, before coming into the possession David Revenaugh. Under Brian Amble, who owned the boat from 2001 until at least 2007, she was known once more by her original name, \"Doris\".\nAt its NRHP listing in 1984, the yacht was located in the Connecticut River off River Rd., Deep River, Connecticut, but it was expected to be moved for an upcoming restoration. Latest information is that the ship is owned by Crocker's Boatyard in New London, Connecticut. According to the Herreshoff Registry, the ship \"is currently in poor condition and is in imminent danger of being cut up.\"\nOriginal construction drawings for much of the ship are preserved in the collection at the Hart Nautical Museum, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nShe is currently under restoration at Snediker Yacht Restoration."

Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed.\nBiography.\nBaseball records do not indicate that Green played minor league baseball. He appeared in a single major league game, for the Philadelphia Athletics on July 2, 1924. The \"Altoona Tribune\" noted that Green had been playing for a semi-professional team associated with the Strawbridge and Clothier Store of Philadelphia as an outfielder. With the Athletics facing the New York Yankees in the second game of a home doubleheader at Shibe Park, Green entered the game as a pinch hitter, batting for starting pitcher Fred Heimach. Green's at bat came in the bottom of the second inning with the Yankees holding a 3–0 lead; facing pitcher Herb Pennock with two outs and runners at first and third, Green hit into a force out at second base, ending the inning. Green did not play defensively, as he was replaced by reliever Bob Hasty, who pitched the final seven innings for the Athletics. Pennock pitched a complete game as the Yankees won, 10–1. By mid-July, Green was back playing with the Strawbridge and Clothier Store semi-professional team.\nGreen was born in 1897 in Philadelphia. His draft registration card of September 1918 indicates that he was employed at the Budd Company in Philadelphia as a mechanical draftsman. Green died in 1972 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and was interred in Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania."

They have been nicknamed the \"Chargers\".\nHistory.\nThe West Coast side played its first match against Canterbury, losing 30–16 on 3 June 1915 at Victoria Park, Greymouth. That night the West Coast Rugby League was formed. Canterbury then played Blackball the next day, winning 23-10 before defeating Hokitika 33–8 on 5 June.\nThe team for the West Coast was; H. Lawrence, L. Smith, L. Hunter, A. Hobson, W. Kirk, Hay, R. Watts, J. Rear, S.Bligh, A. Kells, D. McCann, T. Todd, J. Stenhouse.\nThey next played in 1919 when they lost to Canterbury 5–3.\nThe West Coast recorded their first win in 1923 when they defeated Wellington 12–6. They first defeated Canterbury in 1931, winning 37–19, before following it up the following year with a 53–26 win.\nSince then rugby league has traditionally been the most successful team sport in the West Coast. However, since the 1990s the West Coast has usually participated in Second Division or South Island competitions and in particular the West Coast missed out on having a team in either the Lion Red Cup or Bartercard Cup, the two main New Zealand Rugby League competitions of the 1990s and 2000s.\nDespite this, the West Coast has had some success in recent years. In the 1995 season the West Coast won the South Island division of the National Provincial competition and advanced to the final, losing to Wellington. The NPC was that year an invitational competition due to the Lion Red Cup.\nHowever, in 1997 the West Coast Chargers advanced to the semi-finals of a full national competition, losing to Canterbury 24–40 in an away semi final.\nIn 2000 the West Coast competed in the Mainland Super 10, a competition involving three South Island districts and seven Canterbury Rugby League clubs. The West Coast Chargers performed below expectations and finished eighth. The West Coast declined to take part in the 2001 edition of the competition after it was moved to the first half of the season.\nIn 2004 the West Coast played the touring Russian national team.\nThe West Coast is currently represented by the South Island team in the National Zonal Competition.\nNotable players.\nThe West Coast has produced many New Zealand national rugby league team including Jock Butterfield, Bill McLennan, George Menzies, Whetu Taewa and Kiwis coach Cecil Mountford."

He previously served as the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Pennsylvania State University from 2022 to 2023 and as the head football coach at the University of Miami from 2019 to 2021.\nPrior to his tenure at Duke University, Diaz previously served as an assistant coach at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Miami, Mississippi State University, Louisiana Tech University, University of Texas at Austin, Middle Tennessee State University, North Carolina State University and Florida State University.\nEarly life.\nDiaz, son of former Miami mayor Manny Diaz, was born on March 13, 1974. At Miami Country Day School, Diaz was a three sport athlete in football, basketball and baseball. In 1991, Diaz was a \"Miami Herald\" honorable mention All-Dade County Scholar-Athlete for football, basketball and baseball. Diaz is a graduate of Florida State University, where he joined the Gamma Rho Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity.\nCoaching career.\nFlorida State.\nDiaz began his coaching career at Florida State University in 1998, working alongside defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews for two seasons. During his stint, the Florida State Seminoles appeared in back-to-back BCS National Championship Games, a loss to the Tennessee Volunteers in the 1999 Fiesta Bowl and a win against the Virginia Tech Hokies in the 2000 Sugar Bowl.\nNC State.\nDiaz played a major role for one of the country's top-ranked defenses by coaching safeties in 2004 and 2005 and handling the linebackers in 2002 and 2003 for the NC State Wolfpack.\nThe 2005 NC State Wolfpack football team finished eighth nationally in total defense, sixth in third-down percentage, and twelfth in scoring defense en route to a 7–5 record and a shutout win over the South Florida Bulls in the 2005 Meineke Car Care Bowl. Diaz also served as special teams coordinator and the kickoff return unit finished fifth nationally, while the punt return team blocked four kicks.\nIn his first year as safeties coach and special teams coordinator in 2004, NC State's defense finished the year as the top-ranked unit in the country in total defense by allowing just over 220 yards per game. The Wolfpack defense also held national powers Ohio State and Florida State to under 130 yards of total offense during the season. Diaz's players included All-ACC performer and former New York Jets player Andre Maddox. His 2004 special teams at NC State also had three blocked punts and two returns for touchdowns.\nDiaz handled the linebackers for NC State in 2002 and 2003. The 2003 NC State Wolfpack football team finished 7–5 with Diaz sharing play-calling duties for all 11 games. He also made all the defensive calls during the 2003 Tangerine Bowl win over the Kansas Jayhawks.\nIn 2002, his first year as a full-time coach, Diaz helped the Wolfpack to one of their best seasons ever, finishing 11–3 and defeating Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. He shared in the play-calling duties, and NC State ended the year ranked 14th nationally in total defense and 10th in scoring defense.

Diaz also coached linebackers for two years after mentoring the safeties during his first two seasons in Murfreesboro.\nIn four years under Diaz, the Middle Tennessee defense led its conference in sacks and tackles for loss twice, and finished no lower than third in the league in either category during his tenure. In 2009, the Blue Raiders finished second nationally in tackles for loss, stopping more than eight and a half plays per game behind the line of scrimmage. Diaz's defense also ranked sixth nationally in sacks that season, posting nearly three per game.\nAlso in 2009, Diaz tutored defensive end Chris McCoy who was tabbed the Sun Belt Conference co-Defensive Player of the Year. McCoy led the league and ranked sixth nationally in tackles for loss. Safety Jeremy Kellem and cornerbacks Alex Suber and Marcus Udell were also named first team all-SBC.

That was a dramatic turnaround for MSU from the season prior to his arrival. In 2009, the defense finished 71st in scoring defense, 62nd in rushing defense and 89th in TFL. Mississippi State also finished ranked 13th in red zone defense (.73) and 22nd in turnovers forced (28) nationally this season.\nTexas.\nDiaz was introduced as the defensive coordinator for the Texas Longhorns in January 2011. During his first season at Texas, Diaz led the top defense in the Big 12 as the Longhorns ranked first in the conference in total defense, rushing defense and pass defense. Overall the unit ranked 11th nationally in total defense and was sixth against the run despite facing six offenses that ranked in the top 15 nationally.\nOn September 7, 2013, the Longhorns' defense, under Diaz, gave up a school record 550 yards rushing to Brigham Young University, including 257 to quarterback Taysom Hill. The following day, Mack Brown described the defensive performance as \"unacceptable\" and relieved Diaz of his duties as defensive coordinator. \nLouisiana Tech.\nOn January 21, 2014, Louisiana Tech hired Diaz as its defensive coordinator under head coach Skip Holtz. Diaz succeeded Kim Dameron, who had departed after a single season to become head coach at Eastern Illinois. In Diaz's lone season as defensive coordinator at Louisiana Tech, the Bulldogs led FBS in turnovers gained (42) with 16 fumble recoveries and 26 interceptions.\nSecond stint at Mississippi State.\nOn January 5, 2015 it was announced that Diaz would return to Mississippi State as defensive coordinator. Diaz spent the 2015 season with the Bulldogs, where his unit held opponents to 23.2 points per game and ranked in the nation’s top 10 in red zone defense and tackles for loss.\nMiami.\nOn January 2, 2016, University of Miami football head coach Mark Richt named Miami native Manny Diaz as the Hurricanes’ defensive coordinator for the start of the 2016 campaign. In his first season at Miami, Diaz was a nominee for the Broyles Award, given to the top assistant coach in college football. Diaz spent three seasons as the defensive coordinator under Richt. In his first year at the helm of the defense, Diaz's unit ranked No. 20 nationally in total defense, No. 9 in yards per play, No. 12 in scoring defense, No. 5 in tackles for loss, No. 22 in team sacks and tied for No. 8 in defensive touchdowns allowed. Miami was the only team in the country to start three true freshmen linebackers in 2016.\nDiaz is considered the mastermind behind the \"Turnover Chain,\" a Cuban link chain with a charm in the shape of the school's iconic \"U\" logo, designed by famed Miami jeweler Anthony John Machado, more commonly known as \"A.J. The Jeweler.\" Citing a need for his defense to create more turnovers, the chain became a frenzy as Miami opened the 2017 season 10-0 and won the ACC Coastal Division for the first time. Miami appeared in the 2017 Capital One Orange Bowl. Continuing the impressive trends from Diaz’s first year running the defense, the Hurricanes ranked among the nation’s leaders in several defensive categories in 2017, including first nationally in team sacks, third nationally in tackles for loss and ninth nationally in opponent yards per play.\nIn his final season as defensive coordinator in 2018, the Hurricanes ranked No. 4 in NCAA in total defense and ranked No. 1 in several categories, including tackles for loss, third down conversion percentage and passing yards allowed. Diaz and his staff also unveiled the second \"Turnover Chain\" in Miami's home opener against Savannah State. Also designed by A.J. The Jeweler, Turnover Chain 2.0 featured a charm in the shape of Sebastian the Ibis, the school's mascot.\nTemple.\nOn December 13, 2018, Diaz was named the 28th head football coach at Temple University, replacing Geoff Collins, who left to become the head coach at Georgia Tech. However, he left the team just two weeks later to return to Miami and was named head football coach on December 30, 2018. Diaz apologized for the circumstances and said \"I hate the way this unfolded with respect to Temple...I was given a tremendous opportunity to lead the Temple program and...I do hope that the Temple players, administration and fans appreciate the uniqueness of this situation and the overwhelming pull to stay home.\"\nReturn to Miami.\nAfter Mark Richt's retirement on December 30, 2018, Diaz was hired as head coach at the University of Miami. He was introduced at a press conference on January 2, 2019.\nIn three seasons, Diaz posted a 21-15 record. In his third season, Miami was ranked in the Top 15 of the Associated Press poll but stumbled to a 2-4 start. Although the team recovered to finish 7-5, media speculated Diaz was in danger of losing his job. On December 6, 2021, Miami fired him.\nPenn State.\nOn December 11, 2021, Diaz was hired to be the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Penn State University under head coach James Franklin. Diaz replaced long-time defensive coordinator Brent Pry after his departure to become head coach at Virginia Tech.\nDuke.\nOn December 7, 2023, Diaz was named the 23rd head coach at Duke University.\nPersonal life.\nDiaz served as a production assistant at ESPN. The last highlight reel he cut was the 1997 Masters. Diaz and his wife, Stephanie, live in State College, Pennsylvania with their three sons, Colin, Gavin and Manny."

Brazil were the winners, winning by eight goals to two. Brazil have beaten fifteen other teams to be crowned \"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Winners\". It was Brazil's second title in a row.\nRoads to the final.\nMexico.\nMexico started their campaign in group A, along with Brazil, with a tight opening game against Russia, with Mexico eventually seeing them off 2-1 on penalties to earn 2 points. Things were looking bad for Mexico after losing 6-4 to Brazil in the second round of games, putting Russia in the driving seat to take second place in the group and progress to the quarter finals. However, in the final round of games, with Mexico winning 6-3 against the Solomon Islands, and Brazil beating Russia, Mexico sneaked through into the quarter-finals, finishing the group on a meagre 5 points.\nAs Mexico were the runners-up of group A, they met the winners of group B, Spain in the quarter-finals. Spain were the favorites to reach the semi-finals but, after coming from behind, Mexico produced a surprising win, and clinched the game 5-4, holding their nerve in the final moments. Mexico moved into the semi-finals against Uruguay.\nThe semi-final was, in the end, an easier battle for Mexico. With the score at 2-2 going into the final 5 minutes, the game seemed poised for extra-time. However 3 goals in the 32nd, 35th and 36th minutes meant Mexico finished off their semi-final in style, and secured their place in the final against Brazil.\nBrazil.\nBrazil started their world cup campaign as defending champions, in group A, along with Mexico, demolishing the Solmon Islands 11-2 in their opening game of the group. Brazil continued to perform well with a 6-4 win against Mexico, however left it late to score 2 goals in the third period to secure the three points. Finally, Brazil met Russia. The game was extremely close, seeing Russia lead 2-1 with three minutes left, but a 33rd-minute goal by Sidney sent the game to extra-time and ultimately, penalties. It was a very nerve-racking shoot-out, seeing seven players from each team take a penalty but in the end, it was Brazil who prevailed, taking the 2 points and denying Russia a place in the quarter finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Brazil played the runners-up of group B, Portugal. The two rival nations battled it out in a match full of goals, but it was Brazil's ability to produce goals at any time that saw them beat Portugal 10-7. In the semi-finals Brazil met, 2005 winners, France. It was a simple game for Brazil, winning 6-2, only ever having to deal with French goals in the 1st and 35th minutes, setting up a final with Mexico."

        "text": "Louie Ernest Brown (20 May 1905 – 3 June 1947) was a New Zealand professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s and 1930s. He played at representative level for New Zealand, Other Nationalities and Auckland, as a or .\nPersonal life.\nLou Brown was the son of Frank Brown, and Emma Catherine Brown, and the nephew of the \"Harrison brothers, well known in the early days of football in this [Auckland] province\". He attended the Vermont Street Marist Brothers School in Auckland in the 1910s.\nPlaying career.\nHe played rugby union whilst at school and once scored 4 tries in a seven-a-side final against Point Chevalier whilst playing halfback, and in 1919 scored against Ponsonby. Brown began his adult career playing rugby for Te Kowhai in the Waikato after moving there from Auckland, and in 1921 he transferred to the Frankton rugby club. He was renowned for his pace which he had from an early age. At the Ngaruawahia Annual Athletic Championships in early 1922 he placed first in the 100 yard, and 220 yard races, and second in the 40 yard race.\nIn 1922 he returned to Auckland early in the season to play in the Auckland Rugby League competition for the Newton Rangers. He made his Auckland début against New South Wales in the same season as a seventeen-year-old. After the 1923 season, Brown went to England and played for Wigan as an amateur in several reserve games. On his return, Brown joined City. Newton appealed, which was upheld by both the Auckland Rugby League, and the New Zealand Rugby League. As a result, he was suspended but after a protracted struggle was eventually released by Newton to play for City.\nIn 1927 he returned to England, joining Wigan as a professional.\nBrown also played for Halifax and York. In May 1934 Brown suffered a severe throat cut and was hospitalised in a serious condition. He had written letters intimating that he was keen to return to New Zealand and this injury came as a shock. The York League Football Club were unaware of his desire to return to New Zealand and said that they were happy to allow him to return to New Zealand on a \"vacational visit\". He did indeed return to Auckland in time to represent New Zealand in 1935. He also had further stints in France, with Bordeaux and Bramley before suffering the illness that caused his death in 1947.\nRepresentative career.\n Brown debuted for New Zealand on their 1925 tour of Australia where he played in 9 matches and scored 4 tries. Brown won caps for New Zealand in 1926 against England (2 matches) and Wales, in 1927 against England, in 1935 against Australia (3 matches), and in 1936 against England (2 matches), and won cap(s) for Other Nationalities while at Wigan against England. Brown was part of the 1926-27 tour of Great Britain that was marred by player discontent. He captained the Kiwis in one test match against Australia in 1935. In the same season he also made 2 appearances for the Auckland Māori team which was in its second ever season. He scored 4 tries in their wins over Takahiwai from Northland, and Hawke's Bay Māori.\nChallenge Cup Final appearances.\nBrown played on the and scored a try in Wigan's 13–2 victory over Dewsbury in the 1928-29 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1929.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nBrown played on the and scored a try in Wigan's 5–4 victory over Widnes in the 1928 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1928–29 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 24 November 1928.\nDeath.\nBrown died in Auckland on 3 June 1947 and was buried at Waikaraka Cemetery. In an obituary in the Gisborne Herald it was written that \"one of the finest wing three-quarters New Zealand has produced, Lou Brown, has died in Auckland\". And that \"Brown was rated as the finest wing three-quarter in England in 1929 when he scored a record tally of 43 tries in the season. The Otago Daily Times also mentioned that he had in fact played rugby league for the French international side saying \"when the game was introduced into France, he went across the channel as a coach, and had the distinction, unique, surely in sporting annals, of playing for that country. One of Lou Brown's most prized possessions was a medal which was presented to him by the French Rugby League commemorating his inclusion in the team\""

        "text": "Martin Sauer (born 17 December 1982) is a German former representative rowing coxswain. He was an eight-time world champion at the senior level and three-time underage world champion. He is a triple Olympian and a triple Olympic medallist. He held his seat as coxswain of the German senior men's eight — the Deutschlandachter — constantly from 2009 to 2021 and steered that crew to their six world championship titles and also when at the 2017 World Rowing Cup II they set a world's best time of 5.18.68, which still the standing world mark as of 2021.\nHe coxed the German crew which won the gold medal in the men's eight competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he steered Germany's men's eight to their silver medal win. He was selected in the German Olympic rowing squad for Tokyo 2021 and coxed the men's eight for his third Olympic appearance and his second Olympic silver medal.\nEarly career.\nSauer was born in 1982 in Wriezen. His club rowing has been from the Berliner RuderClub in Berlin.\nRepresentative rowing career.\nSauer's international representative debut was at the junior level, when he won a gold medal in the German junior men's eight at the World Rowing Junior Championships in 2010 in Zagreb. He moved in to the German lightweight men's eight for the 2001 season and they finished in overall ninth place at the 2001 World Rowing Championships. For the next tree years he represented at the U23 level. The Nations Cup in 2002 and 2003 were the then-equivalent of the U23 World Championships and Sauer was in the stern of German coxed fours which finished fifth in 2002 and took gold in 2003. At the first true World Rowing U23 Championships in Poznan in 2004 Sauer steered the German men's U23 eight to a gold medal win.\nSauer stepped into the German senior squad in 2005 and took a coxed four to Japan for the 2005 World Rowing Championships where they placed third.The next year at the 2006 World Rowing Championships on Eton Dorney, they won gold and Sauer's first world championship title. At the 2007 World Rowing Championships with Sauer at the helm the coxed four won a bronze medal and the in 2008 Sauer coxed the men's lightweight eight to a World Championship silver medal.\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics saw the retirement of Peter Thiede who had been at the helm of the German men's eight since re-unification and was the East German men's eight coxswain from 1987. Sauer steered the eight at the 2008 European Championships and then from 2009 made the stern seat his own in the new Olympiad's rebuilt Deutschlandachter. They won gold and Sauer's second World Championship title at the 2009 World Rowing Championships. In 2010 the eight was undefeated in finals during the international season and then at 2010 World Championships in New Zealand they defended their World Championship title. With Sauer on the rudder, the German crew won their third consecutive title at the 2011 World Championships after again winning all races they contested at three Rowing World Cups. At the 2012 Olympics in London, the favoured German eight won the gold medal with a crew consisting of Filip Adamski, , Eric Johannesen, Maximilian Reinelt, Richard Schmidt, Lukas Müller, Florian Mennigen, Kristof Wilke and Sauer. Later that year each member of the crew was awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), Germany's highest sports award, for the achievement.\nAfter his first Olympic success, Sauer remained constant in the German eight who since 2010 have been strong, permanent rivals against the British men's eight. From 2013 to 2015, the German team won gold each year at the European Rowing Championships but come the World Championship finals, the Great Britain pipped them each time by a margin of less than one second relegating the German eight to three consecutive silver medals. In the lead-up to Rio 2016 Germany again finished either first or second at each regatta in the international season. In Rio the German crew won their heat but in the final were again beaten by Great Britain with a 1.33 second margin. Sauer now had his second Olympic medal – a silver and later that year he received a second Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), Germany's highest sports award.\nIn 2017 Sauer, Malte Jakschik, Richard Schmidt, and stroke Hannes Ocik were the only members of the German Olympic eight who rowed on. The eight was rebuilt around this stern end brains-trust. Sauer drove them through their dominant season campaign, winning gold at the European Championships, two World Rowing Cups and ultimately at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in Sarasota, Florida where the German eight were once again crowned world champions. In June 2017 at the World Rowing Cup II in Poznan they set a new world's best time for the eight, taking 0.67 seconds off a 2012 mark that had been set by Canada. The German crew with every man holding the same seat, continued their European and world dominance throughout 2018 winning at three World Rowing Cups, the 2018 European Championships and then defending their world title at the 2018 World Rowing Championships in Plovdiv. There were a handful of changes to the eight in 2019 but Sauer remained in the stern for another successful international season culminating in his sixth world championship title at the 2019 World Rowing Championships in Ottensheim.\nThe German men's eight's 2019 performances qualified that boat for Tokyo 2020. By the time of the 2021 selections for those delayed Olympics, Sauer was still in the crew and made his third Olympic rowing appearance for another silver medal win."

        "text": "Daniel Patrick Quinn (born September 11, 1970) is an American football coach who is the head coach of the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). Born in New Jersey, he attended Salisbury University and competed in the hammer throw and as a defensive lineman for their football team in the early 1990s. Quinn later coached defensive lines in college prior to joining the NFL in 2001. He was the defensive coordinator of the Legion of Boom-era Seattle Seahawks that appeared in two consecutive Super Bowls, winning XLVIII.\nQuinn was hired as head coach of the Atlanta Falcons in 2015. He led the team to Super Bowl LI the following season where the Falcons surrendered a 28-3 lead, the largest in Super Bowl history. Quinn and the Falcons would make the playoffs only one more time before he was fired midway through the 2020 season. He joined the Dallas Cowboys as defensive coordinator the following season, coaching units that led the league in takeaways for three years prior to him being hired as Commanders head coach in 2024.\nEarly life and college.\nQuinn was born on September 11, 1970, in Morristown, New Jersey. He grew up in nearby Morris Township and played football at Morristown High School before graduating in 1989. Quinn attended Salisbury University, an NCAA Division III school, and played defensive lineman on its football team from 1990 to 1993. He was a four-year starter in football and held the school's hammer throw record (168.8 feet) until 2012. Quinn was inducted into Salisbury's athletic hall of fame in 2005.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career (1994–2012).\nQuinn began his coaching career with the William &amp; Mary Tribe football team in 1994 and at Virginia Military Institute in 1995, working with their defensive lines. From 1996 to 1999, Quinn served as the defensive line coach at Hofstra and their defensive coordinator in 2000. He was hired as a defensive quality control coach by the San Francisco 49ers in 2001. He was promoted to defensive line coach in 2003, later working the same role for the Miami Dolphins (2005–2006), New York Jets (2007–2008), and Seattle Seahawks (2009–2010). He also served as defensive coordinator of the Florida Gators (2011–2012).\nSeattle Seahawks (2013–2014).\nOn January 17, 2013, Quinn was hired by the Seahawks as their defensive coordinator. In his first season, the Seahawks led the league in fewest points allowed (231), fewest yards allowed (4,378), and takeaways (39), to become the first team since the 1985 Chicago Bears to accomplish the feat; the Seahawks went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII over the Denver Broncos 43-8 led by their strong secondary dubbed the Legion of Boom.\nAtlanta Falcons (2015–2020).\nOn February 2, 2015, Quinn was hired as head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. He won his first game as head coach on \"Monday Night Football\". The Falcons started 5-0 before finishing the season 8–8 and missing the playoffs. In the 2016 season, the Falcons won the NFC South with an 11–5 record. In the Divisional Round, the Falcons defeated the Seattle Seahawks 36–20 before defeating the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship, advancing to Super Bowl LI. In the Super Bowl, the Falcons gave up a 28-3 lead in the third quarter, the largest in Super Bowl history.\nIn the 2017 season, the Falcons finished the year 10–6, which was only good enough for 3rd in the NFC South, but also good enough for the 6th seed in the playoffs. In the Wild Card Round, the Falcons defeated the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Rams by a score of 26–13 and advanced to the Divisional Round. In the Divisional Round, the Falcons lost on the road to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 15–10. In the 2018 season, the Falcons were injury riddled throughout the season, losing seven starters to injured reserve and more for at least a game. Ultimately, the team finished 7–9, which placed the Falcons at second in the NFC South, and as the eight seed in the NFC, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2015. Following the firing of defensive coordinator Marquand Manuel, Quinn took on the position of defensive coordinator for the Falcons. \nIn the 2019 season, the Falcons started the first half of the season going 1–7 with growing speculation that Falcons owner Arthur Blank would fire Quinn sometime during or at the end of the season. However, after a defensive turnaround with Quinn distributing some of the defensive play-calling duties to assistants, the team finished the season at 7–9, again placing second in the NFC South and missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Blank announced that Quinn would return for the 2020 season after the season. The Falcons began the 2020 season with a 38-24 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. This loss marked Quinn's 40th loss of his head coaching career including playoff losses. On October 11, 2020, after an 0–5 start to the season, the Falcons' first since 1997, Quinn, along with general manager Thomas Dimitroff, was fired by the Falcons. The team named defensive coordinator Raheem Morris as the interim head coach. Quinn finished his tenure in Atlanta with a 43–42 (.506) regular season record, 3–2 (.600) playoff record and a 46–44 (.511) career record.\nDallas Cowboys (2021–2023).\nOn January 11, 2021, Quinn was hired by the Dallas Cowboys as their defensive coordinator under head coach Mike McCarthy, replacing Mike Nolan, who was dismissed following the 2020 season. Quinn stepped in as acting head coach in a game against the New Orleans Saints after McCarthy had tested positive for COVID-19. In Quinn's first season as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator, the team finished atop the NFC East with a 12–5 record. A year after the Cowboys allowed a franchise-record 473 points and second-most rushing yards in franchise history, Quinn's defensive unit ranked 19th in the league in yards allowed per play (5.5), eighth in opponent's points per game (21.2) and first in takeaways (34). He was named the season's Assistant Coach of the Year. In January 2022, Quinn and the Cowboys agreed to a multi-year contract extension.\nWashington Commanders (2024–present).\nOn February 3, 2024, Quinn was named head coach of the Washington Commanders. He hired former Texas Tech and Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury as offensive coordinator and Cowboys secondary coach Joe Whitt Jr. as defensive coordinator.\nHead coaching record.\nSix of Quinn's assistants have been hired as head coaches:\nPersonal life.\nQuinn met his wife Stacey while they were in college at Salisbury. He is a Catholic."

        "title": "Tennis on CBS",
        "text": "Tennis on CBS is the branding used for broadcasts of professional tennis tournaments that were produced by CBS Sports, the sports division of the CBS television network in the United States. At the time the network's broadcast agreements with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) ended in 2014, CBS held the broadcast rights to the U.S. Open, the U.S. Open Series and the Sony Ericsson Open. From 1980 to 1982, CBS also televised the French Open (sandwiched in-between stints at NBC). CBS also during the 1970s and 1980s, broadcast the Grand Prix tennis circuit (including the Pepsi Grand Slam). CBS returned to show tennis coverage again after five years, with both World TeamTennis (2019–present) and USA matches at the Davis Cup (2020–present)\nU.S. Open coverage.\nCBS Sports broadcast the first US Open Tennis Championships in 1968. Bud Collins called the action alongside Jack Kramer.\nJames Wall (best known for playing Mr. Baxter on \"Captain Kangaroo\") was also the stage manager for 41 consecutive years on the US Open Tennis Championships telecasts.\nOn May 17, 2013, ESPN signed a contract (an 11-year deal at $770 million; about $250 million more than CBS was willing to pay) with the United States Tennis Association that would give it the rights to broadcast the U.S. Open starting in 2015, ending CBS's role in covering the tournament after 47 years. At the end of their 2014 coverage, CBS for their closing credits montage, highlighting the greatest moments during their 47-year run with the US Open, used Alicia Keys's \"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\".\nWithout the US Open, CBS's SEC college football coverage was now allowed to start on Labor Day weekend and their National Football League coverage to have a doubleheader in Week 1 of regular season.\nScheduling anomalies.\nIn 1982, CBS debuted \"Super Saturday\". The Men's Semifinals sandwiched the Women's Final, with the first semifinal match starting at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nFor the past few decades, the National Football League had always let CBS be the \"singleheader\" network during the week it televised the Men's US Open Tennis final at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time around the country (CBS has said that it could not justify putting the Men's US Open Final on Sunday night in terms of ratings; the women's final, broadcast on a Saturday night, often outrated the men's final by a considerable margin, except when at least one American plays in the men's final).\nAll the courts used by the U.S. Open are lighted, meaning that television coverage of the tournament can extend into prime time to attract higher ratings. This has recently been used to the advantage of the USA Network cable channel and especially for CBS, which used its influence to move the women's singles final to Saturday night to draw higher viewership.\nEffects from the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.\nFor several years, due to the overlapping scheduling of the U.S. Open and the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon on Labor Day weekend, many CBS affiliates had to provide alternate scheduling to accommodate one of the events. This issue was resolved in 2011, when all CBS affiliates that had aired the MDA Telethon became able to air the U.S. Open on Labor Day, as the Muscular Dystrophy Association had decided to reduce the telethon (renamed that year as the MDA Show of Strength) was reduced from a 21½-hour broadcast (lasting from the Sunday night before the holiday to the late-afternoon of Labor Day itself) to a six-hour prime time broadcast (airing only on the night before the holiday).\nSome CBS stations arranged for co-owned/managed independent stations and affiliates of smaller networks (such as UPN/MyNetworkTV affiliate WHTV in Lansing, Michigan in lieu of WLNS-TV; Fox affiliate KASA-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico in lieu of KRQE; and MyNetworkTV affiliate WNEM-DT2 in Flint, Michigan in lieu of its parent station's main channel) to carry the network's coverage of the U.S. Open on Labor Day in order to air the telethon.\nIn other cases, the alternate U.S. Open broadcaster in a given market was unrelated to the local CBS station. In Albany, New York, WB affiliate WEWB-TV (now CW affiliate WCWN, then owned by Tribune Broadcasting) took on the responsibility of airing network coverage of the U.S. Open (as well as other local and network programming) in lieu of Schenectady-based WRGB (then owned by Freedom Communications; WCWN and WRGB are now jointly owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) through 2004. Time Warner Cable's Capital District system (which carried it on channel 3) took over the local rights to the tournament in 2005, due to a crop of syndicated program premieres on Labor Day that prevented WCWN from airing the tournament.\nAdditional US Open coverage.\nOccasionally, \"The Late Late Show\" was split into 15- and 45-minute segments in order to allow CBS to air a daily late-night highlight show for the US Open tennis tournament (as well as the Masters and other PGA Tour events whose broadcast rights are held by CBS). The tournament highlights were broadcast in-between the monologue and the guest segments. However, in mid-2007, the highlights show began airing first, with the full hour of \"The Late Late Show\" airing on a delay.\nIn August 2012, CBS Sports Network began to offer additional coverage of the US Open, including replays of classic matches, coverage of qualifying matches, a pre-match show, and coverage of third- and fourth-round matches not shown by CBS.\nArthur Ashe Kids' Day.\nArthur Ashe Kids' Day is an annual children's event held by the United States Tennis Association that takes place the last Saturday in August at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York. The event, which features professional-amateur charity tennis competitions and features performances from popular music artists, was televised by CBS as a tape delayed broadcast the Sunday after the event; the rights to the Arthur Ashe Kids' Day event moved to ESPN as part of its U.S. Open contract.\nTechnology.\nCBS was the first network to use the MacCam (a system of slow-motion cameras developed by FastCAM Replay LLC and DEL Imaging Systems LLC used during tennis matches to replay close or controversial line calls) widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts. The MacCam was first used at the 2004 US Open to demonstrate several poor calls by chair umpires. In Serena Williams' controversial quarterfinal loss to Jennifer Capriati, several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous.\nIn 2010, CBS broadcast the U.S. Open in 3D on DirecTV N3D.\nControversial moments.\nOn September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set in anger just before a remote broadcast of the \"CBS Evening News\" when it appeared that CBS's coverage of a U.S. Open semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to run into time allotted for the network news program. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II, who began a rare U.S. tour. The tennis match ended at 6:32 p.m. Eastern Time, however Rather was nowhere to be found. Over 100 affiliates broadcast the six minutes of dead air that followed before he returned to the broadcast position. Rather later suggested that he intended to force the sports division to fill up the entire half-hour so that he would not have to truncate the elaborately-planned coverage of the papal visit. The next day, Rather, anchoring from New Orleans, apologized for leaving the anchor desk.\nWhile attending the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York City in September 1995, Jane Bronstein, who is rather large and disfigured from childhood polio and a thyroid condition, was pictured in CBS file footage from the tournament. Although the footage was never intended to be shown to the public, a few seconds of it was shown during a segment on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". The footage showed Bronstein devouring a peach in a matter of seconds and then handing the peach pit to a man seated beside her with a horrified look on his face. Although the audience and Letterman's fans found the clip hilarious, Bronstein and her attorney Harvey Rothberg were not amused and sued for damages in February 1996. The case was settled in March 1997 for undisclosed terms.\nOn September 14, 2009, Juan Martín del Potro upset Roger Federer to win the Men's U.S. Open Championship. Dick Enberg hosted the post-match ceremony during which a victorious Del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request saying that he was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate-sponsored prizes that Del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, Del Potro made the same request again and only then Enberg relented saying \"Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina\". An emotional Del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.\nIn 2010, CBS forced the United States Tennis Association to move the final to Monday out of fear that a relatively short Sunday rain delay was going to knock the Sunday men's final into its prime time lineup (in particular, \"60 Minutes\"). Ironically, the rain by early evening had let up and thus, tennis could have been played. While CBS did get its men's final at 4 p.m. as initially scheduled, another rain delay came about at a little after 6 p.m. By that point however, CBS abandoned its tennis coverage in favor of the \"CBS Evening News\". In the meantime, CBS announced that they wouldn't finish broadcasting the match once the delay had ended. Therefore, viewers had to scramble to ESPN2 to watch the conclusion of that particular Novak Djokovic-Rafael Nadal final. And since ESPN2 themselves eventually had to redirect to the second half of its \"Monday Night Football\" doubleheader, it awkwardly had to cut off from Nadal's post-match ceremony."

The primary objectives of the Under-18 program are to identify, evaluate, and condition players to the rigors of international competition by giving first exposure to off-shore officiating, ice-surfaces, and travel.\nThe Under-18 squad traditionally competes in the month of August, during the off season, to allow players to further develop skills with their respective junior teams in the winter following a week-long camp. A 22-player roster is chosen by scouts and coaches from Hockey Canada to represent Canada on the international stage.\nThe first National Men's Under-18 Team was created in 1981 with the development of the Program of Excellence and has since competed in many international competitions. For the first 10 years of the program, the National Men's Under-18 Team participated in exchange camps with the United States to provide both countries the opportunity to refine the skills of their most gifted young players against top caliber international competition. It was not until the Japanese Ice Hockey Federation introduced the Phoenix Cup, a four-nation tournament designed to improve Japan's international hockey program, in 1991 that Canada took part in an international tournament.\nThe Phoenix Cup (later the Pacific Cup and La Copa Mexico) was a single round robin competition between the national under-18 teams of Canada, Russia, Japan, and the United States. It was competed for between 1991 and 1996, with tournaments in Japan; Mexico City; and Nelson, B.C. In its six-year history, Canada took home three gold medals, two silver and one bronze.\nIn 1997, the National Men's Under-18 Team competed against Slovakia and the Czech Republic in a three-nation tournament in the Czech Republic. Canada captured gold and repeated their performance the following year in Slovakia against Belarus, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.\nSince 2002, Canada's National Men's Under-18 Team has taken part in the IIHF World Under-18 Championship, winning four gold medals (2003, 2008, 2013 and 2021), one silver medal (2005), and three bronze medals (2012, 2014, and 2015).\nRoster.\nIIHF U18 World Championships roster.\nRoster for the 2024 IIHF World U18 Championships:\nHead coach: Gardiner MacDougall\nHlinka Gretzky Cup roster.\nRoster for the 2023 Hlinka Gretzky Cup.\nHead coach: Alan Letang"

        "title": "2011 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2011 tennis season brought no Major victories but was not entirely unsuccessful. This year, when he turned thirty, marked a decline in his standing in the sport. It was the first year since 2002 that he did not win a Grand Slam title, and, with the ascendance of Novak Djokovic to World No. 1, his ranking dropped from 2 to 3 behind Rafael Nadal. However, this season had some high points. In the French Open semifinals, Federer defeated Djokovic and ended his 43-match win streak. Also, he ended the year well by winning three straight titles, including a title at the Paris Masters, and successfully defended his title at the year-end ATP Championships.\nYear summary.\nAustralian Open and early hard court season.\nFederer began the year ranked as the world no. 2 according to the Association of Tennis Professionals rankings. Federer once again started his year with an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi. He beat Robin Söderling in his opening match, before losing to Rafael Nadal in his second match. Federer then got his competitive season underway in Doha. In the first two rounds, Federer beat two qualifiers. The first match was memorable, as Federer pulled off another \"tweener\", a shot between the legs. Federer defeated Viktor Troicki in the quarterfinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals, both in straight sets. Federer then went on to beat Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets for his third title in Doha and the 67th of his career.\nAt the Australian Open, Federer beat Lukáš Lacko in the first round. In the next round, he faced Gilles Simon. Federer won the first two sets easily, but Simon fought back to win the next two sets, before Federer came back to win the last set, tying up the match. Against Xavier Malisse in the third round, Federer set another record, as he defeated the Belgian in straight sets, surpassing Stefan Edberg's record for the number of matches won at the Australian Open in the open era, winning his 57th Australian Open match. In the fourth round, Federer beat Tommy Robredo and equalled Jimmy Connors' record of 27 consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinals. He defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarterfinal, and in a repeat of the 2008 Australian Open semifinals, Djokovic once again defeated Federer in a tight and exciting match. His loss at the 2011 Australian Open marked the first time that he did not hold a Grand Slam title since his first Grand Slam title at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships.\nNext, he participated in the Dubai Tennis Championships, a tournament from which he had been absent for two years. In the first round, he beat Somdev Devvarman, and beat Marcel Granollers in the second round, also in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he beat Sergiy Stakhovsky, and in the semifinals, he beat Richard Gasquet, successfully reaching his second final of the season without dropping a set. He was then beaten by Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\nFederer's next tournament was the Indian Wells Masters in California. He received a bye in the first round and defeated Igor Andreev in the second round. In the third round, he beat Juan Ignacio Chela. In the fourth round, he faced American wildcard Ryan Harrison and won yet again in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he won over his compatriot and occasional doubles partner Wawrinka. In the semifinals, he once again faced Djokovic, but succumbed to him, losing the match in three sets and losing his no. 2 ranking. Federer also entered the men's doubles draw at Indian Wells, partnering with Wawrinka. In the first round, they defeated second seeds Daniel Nestor and Max Mirnyi in straight sets. In the second round, they faced the French duo of Julien Benneteau and Richard Gasquet and defeated them in a tiebreak. They then defeated Mark Knowles and Michal Mertiňák in the quarterfinals, and defeated defending champions Rafael Nadal and Marc López in the semifinals. In the final, they lost to Alexandr Dolgopolov and Xavier Malisse in three tight sets.\nFederer next participated in the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. He received a bye in the first round and defeated Radek Štěpánek in the second in straight sets. In the third round, he faced Juan Mónaco and won in two tight sets. In the fourth round, Federer beat Olivier Rochus in straight sets. He advanced to the semifinals when Gilles Simon retired at three games down. He went on to face Nadal, but lost in straight sets.\nClay court season and French Open.\nFederer's first tournament in the 2011 clay-court season was the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters. After a bye in the first round, he defeated German Philipp Kohlschreiber. He then faced Marin Čilić, whom he defeated. He was then defeated in the quarterfinals by Austrian Jürgen Melzer.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round at the Madrid Masters, he faced Feliciano López in the second round, narrowly winning in three tight sets. He then beat Xavier Malisse and Robin Söderling without dropping a set, before losing to eventual runner-up Rafael Nadal.\nFederer next played in the Rome Masters. He was seeded third behind Nadal and Djokovic and faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round, defeating him in straight sets. He next faced Richard Gasquet, but fell to the Frenchman, after losing a deciding third-set tiebreak.\nFederer next played in the French Open at Roland Garros, where he opened against Feliciano López in the first round and won in straight sets. He followed up this win with another win in straight sets over wildcard Maxime Teixeira. He then went on to face the 29th seed Janko Tipsarević and dispatched him easily. He then faced compatriot and 14th seed Stanislas Wawrinka and defeated him in straight sets, to stay as one of the few players left in the tournament without a dropped set. He next faced ninth seed and home favorite Gaël Monfils, whom he defeated in straight sets with a tie-break in the third set. Federer faced Djokovic in the semifinals, where he ended Djokovic's perfect 2011 undefeated record in four sets. Federer faced Nadal in the final for a fourth time, but lost to him in four sets.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nFederer was scheduled to play in the 2011 Gerry Weber Open in Germany, but withdrew, citing a need to rest ahead of Wimbledon. Federer entered Wimbledon as the third seed, his lowest since the 2002 championships. He defeated Mikhail Kukushkin in the first round in straight sets, after Kukushkin brought him to a first-set tiebreak. He then defeated Adrian Mannarino and David Nalbandian in the second and third rounds, respectively, in straight sets. He then faced Mikhail Youzhny. After losing the first-set tiebreak on an unforced error, he recovered in the next three sets to take the match. Federer entered his 29th straight Grand Slam quarterfinal match with a positive record against his opponent, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He started strong in the first set, locking up the set in less than half an hour, but Tsonga responded, as the two went to a tiebreak in the second, which Federer won. Tsonga then began to work his way around Federer and broke him down, taking the next three sets by breaking Federer and holding serve. Despite a statistically stunning game (64 winners to just 11 unforced errors), Federer simply could not respond and lost a close match in five sets, making this the first time in the season that Federer did not make a Grand Slam semifinal. It was also the first time in 179 matches (and only the third time overall) that Federer lost a match after winning the first two sets.\nUS Open Series and US Open.\nTo open the US Open Series, Federer participated in the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where he had finished as runner-up the previous year to Andy Murray. He moved through to the third round after defeating wildcard Vasek Pospisil in straight sets. In the third round, he lost his second consecutive match to Tsonga (the first being in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon). Federer battled with Tsonga in the first set to a tiebreak, which Tsonga won. He then recovered by winning the second set and leveling the match at one set all, but Tsonga broke him down quickly in the third set to clinch a spot in the quarterfinals. He consequently held a slim 4–3 head-to-head count against Tsonga, after losing their last two meetings. His early exit from the tournament left Novak Djokovic, the eventual champion, as the sole Big Four player left in the main draw, as Murray and Nadal were both upset in the second round by unseeded players.\nFederer entered the Cincinnati Masters as the defending champion, winning the title last year over Mardy Fish. In the second round, he faced Juan Martín del Potro, a player who won his last two meetings against Federer at the 2009 US Open final and the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals. Federer defeated del Potro in a highly anticipated match. He then defeated James Blake, who had defeated him in the quarterfinals of the 2008 Summer Olympics, in the next round. He faced Tomáš Berdych, who had defeated him in the quarterfinals of the 2010 Wimbledon Championships and had won two out of their last three meetings, in the quarterfinals. After a shaky start and a plethora of unforced errors, Federer lost the match, hence failing to defend his title.\nFederer next participated in the 2011 US Open, where he finished last year as a semifinalist after a momentous loss to Djokovic. He started off in the first round with a win against Santiago Giraldo, then breezed past Dudi Sela in straight sets. He next faced 27th-seeded Marin Čilić. After winning the first set and dropping the second after Čilić took a break in the otherwise tight set, Federer cruised through the remainder of the match and defeated Čilić. He cruised past Argentine Juan Mónaco in a late-night match in straight sets, dropping only three games during his victory. He was set up to meet Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, against whom he had lost their previous two encounters. Federer went through the first two sets rather smoothly and held a resurgent Tsonga at bay in the third, defeating him in straight sets. He played Novak Djokovic in the semifinals in a rematch of their Roland Garros semifinal match, where Federer had snapped Djokovic's 43-match winning streak and perfect season start. Federer started strong, winning the first two very close sets in dramatic fashion, but began to show small cracks in his game and lost the next two sets. Both players traded excellent points and service games in those sets. In the deciding set, both Federer and Djokovic held serve until Federer managed to break Djokovic and serve for the match. Despite holding two match points, Federer, in a repeat of last year's US Open match, failed to convert on those match points and Djokovic broke back. As a result, Djokovic gained momentum and won four games in a row to defeat Federer in a very close match. Federer recorded his fourth season loss to Djokovic, losing yet another opportunity to win his first major since the 2010 Australian Open. His loss to Djokovic also marked the second time that season and in his career that he lost a match after winning the first two sets.\nEuropean Indoor Season.\nFederer pulled out of the 2011 Shanghai Masters, citing nagging injuries. As a result, he lost 600 ranking points, which contributed to his drop from world no. 3 to no. 4. This marked the first time that he was outside of the top 3 since the 2003 Wimbledon Championships.\nFederer's next tournament was the Swiss Indoors Basel, which opened nearly one and a half months after his last major tournament at the Davis Cup and two months after his last ATP tournament, the US Open. As the defending champion and the world no. 4, Federer was seeded third behind Djokovic and Murray, and faced Italian Potito Starace. After a shaky start, he defeated Starace in straight sets. He then faced Jarkko Nieminen, who was fresh off a victory over Thomaz Bellucci. Federer blew through the first set, but a few mistakes in the second allowed Nieminen to take the set, bringing it to a tiebreak set. Federer eventually closed the match out with a tally. He then played against Andy Roddick, against whom he has a prolific rivalry, and routed him quickly in a win. In the semifinals, he met Wawrinka for the fourth time in the season. Wawrinka brought Federer to a first-set tiebreak, but Federer won the tiebreak and then took the second set to win the match. Federer played Kei Nishikori in his eighth Basel final, after Nishikori upset the no. 1 seed Djokovic in the semifinals. Federer pulled a quick victory over Nishikori to claim his second consecutive title, his fifth title at Basel, and his second title of the year.\nAfter Basel, Federer won the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris for the first time in his career. He opened up against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino and finished the match in under an hour, winning in straight sets. He next played against Frenchman Richard Gasquet, whom he played last in the Rome Masters, and made short work of him as well. Federer then faced Juan Mónaco, whom he had met at the US Open, in the quarterfinals. After a tight second set, he sealed the match, marking his 800th career match. He next faced Tomáš Berdych in the semifinals, and avenged his loss in Cincinnati with a win in 80 minutes. His win over Berdych made him the first man in the Open Era to reach the final of each of the nine Masters 1000 tournaments. He recorded a straight sets win in 86 minutes over hometown favourite Tsonga in the final to claim his first Paris Masters 1000 trophy.\nIt was his fourth season win over Tsonga, his third title of the year and his second title in two weeks. With his straight sets win, he became the fourth person in history to finish the Paris Masters without dropping a set.\nFederer finished the ATP season by participating in the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals. He was the fourth player to qualify to the Finals this year, and has qualified for the tenth time. He was drawn into Group B, which included Tsonga, debutant Mardy Fish, and arch-rival Rafael Nadal. In his opening round robin match against Tsonga, Federer opened the match with a quick first set. Tsonga came back to life in the second set and evened things out by winning the second set, forcing a deciding set. Federer, who had never won a deciding third set against Tsonga, found a break opportunity late in the set and converted it to win his seventh season match against Tsonga with a score.\nIn his next match against Nadal, Federer won 10 of the last 11 games in the match to rout him in exactly one hour, securing his spot in the semifinals in his 26th meeting with Nadal. Federer therefore brought his win–loss record against Nadal to 9–17 and his indoor record against Nadal to 4–0. In his final round robin match, Federer played Fish for the first time in the season. He defeated Fish after dropping the second set.\nFederer faced the runner-up from Group B, David Ferrer, and defeated him soundly in a straight sets win. Federer advanced to his 100th career final with his win over Ferrer. In the final, he played Tsonga for the eighth time this season in their second consecutive final. After skating past Tsonga with a break in the first set, he was unable to serve out the match in the second, giving up a break to Tsonga. He then held match point at, but Tsonga saved it with a forehand winner and brought the match to a tiebreak. Federer held a slight lead late in the tiebreak, but ended up dropping the set due to backhand errors. Federer then rebounded by picked up a break in the deciding set and wrapped up the match with a tally, claiming his 70th career title and a record 6th ATP World Tour Finals title. He finished the season with a 17-match win streak, which includes three titles won in a matter of four weeks.\nDavis Cup.\nFederer participated in the Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I Portugal vs. Switzerland match-up in Bern, where he and Wawrinka teamed up to qualify Switzerland for the World Group Playoffs by sweeping Portugal, 5–0. Federer first played Rui Machado in a singles draw. After dropping the first set, he won the next three to bring Switzerland's score to 2–0. He then teamed up with Wawrinka, also his gold medal-winning doubles partner at the 2008 Summer Olympics, to defeat Frederico Gil and Leonardo Tavares in straight sets, sealing a victory for Switzerland. His final match was scheduled to be a dead rubber against Frederico Gil, but the schedule was changed so that he would not have to play.\nFederer led the Swiss team to the World Group play-offs Australia vs. Switzerland match-up in Sydney. Switzerland entered the match-up with an 0–4 win–loss record versus the Australians. Federer played Lleyton Hewitt in the second rubber, following Wawrinka's surprising loss to Bernard Tomic. Federer dropped the first set, after Hewitt capitalized on the only break of serve in the set, but Federer regained momentum after winning a second-set tiebreak and finished the match strong, levelling the match-up score at 1–1. In the doubles rubber, Federer and Wawrinka faced off against Hewitt and Chris Guccione and started off strong with a first-set win. However, in a surprise upset, Hewitt and Guccione ran away with the match, gaining momentum after winning the second set on a contested break point that was won by the Australians earlier in the set. Federer dropped to 11–6 in Davis Cup doubles with the loss to Hewitt and Guccione. Federer played Bernard Tomic in the fourth rubber, which might have decided the match-up in favor of the Australians. Federer jumped out to a two-set lead after a closely fought second set, but Tomic took the third set to extend the match to four sets. Federer eventually prevailed, levelling the match-up at 2–2. The deciding rubber between Wawrinka and Hewitt, played to five sets and over four hours, decided the matchup in favor of the Swiss, and Switzerland advanced to the 2012 Davis Cup World Group.\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-Head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\""

        "title": "Major League Baseball rivalries",
        "text": "Throughout its history, Major League Baseball rivalries have occurred between many teams and cities. Rivalries have arisen for many different reasons, the primary ones including geographic proximity, familiarity with opponents, various incidents, and cultural, linguistic, or national pride.\nBackground.\nIn the \"Original 16\" era (1901–1960), there were 8 teams in each league and teams in each league played each other 22 times a season. With the second American League incarnation of the Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers) and the Los Angeles Angels entering play as expansion teams in , MLB increased the total number of games American League teams played to 162, which meant teams would play each other 18 times a season. The National League did not implement this until the following year when the New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s (now the Houston Astros) entered play.\nIn , with the San Diego Padres, Seattle Pilots, Kansas City Royals, and Montreal Expos entering play as expansion teams, MLB split both leagues into two divisions with six teams each. Teams played a total of 90 intra-divisional games, playing teams within the division 18 times each, and 72 inter-divisional games, playing each team in the other division 12 times. However, in , the addition of the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays reduced the number of intra-divisional games American League teams played to 78, as each team would play each team within the division 13 times. However, they still played each team in the other division 12 times, but the total number of inter-divisional games increased to 84. The National League did not institute this until , when the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies entered play.\nIn , MLB split each league into three divisions, but kept the 1993 format in scheduling. In , with MLB adopting interleague play, the schedules were changed. The schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series, namely six series (eighteen games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\nMLB changed its scheduling format in , further intensifying division matchups throughout the league. The new \"unbalanced schedule\" allowed for additional games in each season between divisional rivals, replacing additional series with teams outside the division. Due to the change, division rivals now played each other 17 or more times each season. The scheduling drew criticism both when it was enacted and after the fact, with some analysts even positing that the unbalanced schedule \"hurt\" intra-divisional play.\nWith the Astros moving to the American League West in , MLB changed its scheduling formula as a result of each division having five teams. Teams play a total of 76 intra-divisional games, playing teams within the division 19 times each, and six or seven games against other teams in their leagues and 20 interleague games. The move of the Astros led to interleague play throughout the season. The number of interleague games against natural rivals was reduced from six to four. Beginning in 2023, intradivisional games were reduced to 13 while teams get three interleague games against each non-natural opponent and four against a natural rival.\nAmerican League.\nAmerican League East.\nBoston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees.\nThe Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous, and fiercest rivalries in American sports. For more than 100 years, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees have been intense rivals.\nThe rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States. Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, the AL East rivals have squared off in the American League Championship Series three times: The Yankees won in 1999 and 2003, and the Red Sox won in 2004. The two also faced off in the American League Division Series in 2018, with the Red Sox winning in four games. The teams most recently played in a One-game playoff after the 2021 season, in which the Sox topped the Yanks at Fenway Park. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in (when the Red Sox won) and (when the Yankees won).\nThe teams also finished tied for first in , when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title. The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, the 2004 ALCS is famous for the Yankees leading 3–0 and ultimately losing a best-of-7 series.\nIn 2019, the rivalry was showcased in the first London Series, with the Yankees winning both games.\nThe rivalry is often termed the \"greatest rivalry in all of sports.\" Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. In the stands, it is very common for Yankees fans and Red Sox fans to taunt each other and get into fistfights, so security at both Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park is heavy when either team comes to town.\nBoston Red Sox vs. Tampa Bay Rays.\nThe Rays–Red Sox rivalry is contested between the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox. Though this rivalry is more recent than the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry, both teams have regularly competed for the AL East title since 2008, winning it a combined seven times in the past 13 years. They have also met in the postseason several times, most recently in 2021. Due to this level of close competition, the rivalry has been called one of the most competitive in the modern American League.\nAmerican League Central.\nDetroit Tigers vs. Chicago White Sox.\nThe rivalry between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox is one of the oldest active rivalries in the league today. Both teams joined the American League in 1901 and have actively played one another regularly for over 120 years. There are other professional sports teams rivalries between Chicago and Detroit, such as the Bulls–Pistons rivalry in the NBA. Despite playing one another for over 2,200 games, both teams have yet to meet in the postseason in their 122-year series.\nMinnesota Twins vs. Chicago White Sox.\nThe Twins–White Sox rivalry is contested between the Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. Though both teams are charter members of the American League, the rivalry did not begin in earnest until the 2000s, when the White Sox and Twins consistently battled for the AL Central crown. In the 2000s, they combined to win 8 out of the 10 AL Central division titles of the decade. Their most prominent meeting occurred in the 2008 American League Central tie-breaker game, which was necessitated by the two clubs finishing the season with identical records.\nAmerican League West.\nLone Star Series: Texas Rangers vs. Houston Astros.\nThe Lone Star Series (also, Silver Boot Series) is a Major League Baseball rivalry featuring Texas' two major league franchises, the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros. It is an outgrowth of the \"natural rivalry\" established by MLB as part of interleague play as the Rangers are a member of the American League and the Astros were a member of the National League until .\nDuring interleague play, the winner of the 6-game series was awarded the Silver Boot. A tall display of a size-15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. If the series was split (3–3), the winner was the club which scored the most runs over the course of the series.\nIn , the Astros joined the American League West with the Rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intra-division rivalry, the Astros played their first game in the American League against the Rangers on Sunday Night Baseball that season. In 2015, both teams made the playoffs and were in a tight division race during most of the season.\nIn 2023, the Rangers and Astros qualified for the postseason, marking the first time since 2015 that both teams made the postseason. While both teams finished the regular season with identical records (90–72), the Astros had the better head-to-head record (9–4). As such, the Astros won their third consecutive division title (and sixth in seven years), whilst the Rangers were relegated to the wild card berth. The two teams had their first postseason matchup in the ALCS. With the visiting team winning every game, the Rangers won the series in seven games en route to their first World Series title, which they achieved by defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games.\nLos Angeles Angels vs. Oakland Athletics.\nThe Los Angeles Angels and Oakland Athletics have held a steady rivalry since their relocation to California and to the AL West in 1969. Though not as intense as the Dodgers–Giants rivalry equivalent in the National League, the A's and Angels have often been competitive in their own battle for the division through the decades. The peak of the rivalry was during the early part of the millennium as both teams were stellar and perennial contenders. But even then, there were only two down-to-the-wire finishes between the Angels and the A's during that time. During the 2002 season; both teams were proving to be contenders as The A's famous Moneyball tactics led them to a league record 20 game win streak; knocking the Angels out of the 1st seed in the division, finishing 4 games ahead while the Angels secured the Wild Card berth. Despite the 103 win season for Oakland; they fell in an upset to the Minnesota Twins in the ALDS. The Angels managed to pull off a victory over both the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins and culminated in the franchise's first and only World Series victory. During the 2004 season, both teams came down to the wire: tied for wins headed into the final week of September with the last three games being played in Oakland against the Angels. Both teams were battling to secure the lowest remaining wild card spot, however; Oakland fell in 2 losses to the Angels with only one victory in the series coming in the final game. Oakland found themselves eliminated from the playoff hunt, though the Angels suffered a sweep at the hands of the eventual champion Boston Red Sox. The Athletics lead the series 527–479, the two teams have yet to meet in the postseason.\nLos Angeles Angels vs. Texas Rangers.\nThe Angels–Rangers rivalry has been said to have developed over a domination in the division between the two teams, and also in recent years more animosity between the two teams due to players who have played for both teams, including Nolan Ryan, Mike Napoli, Darren Oliver, Vladimir Guerrero, C. J. Wilson, and Josh Hamilton. In 2012, Wilson played a joke on Napoli, his former teammate, by tweeting his phone number, causing Napoli to exchange words with Wilson. The feuds go back to two incidents between Angels second baseman Adam Kennedy and Rangers catcher Gerald Laird which led to punches being thrown.\nThe Angels and Rangers have each pitched a perfect game against each other, making them the only pair of MLB teams to have done so. Mike Witt pitched a perfect game for the Angels against the Rangers in 1984 at Arlington Stadium and Kenny Rogers for the Rangers against the Angels in 1994.\nInter-divisional.\nHouston Astros vs. New York Yankees.\nWhile fairly recent, as the teams have rarely met historically before interleague play due to the Astros originally being in the National League, the Astros–Yankees rivalry has taken over baseball. One of their most notable historic meetings came in an exhibition game on April 9, 1965, the inaugural game played at the Astrodome and the first under the Astros team name; the Astros won the game 2–1. As with other teams, the Yankees are known for signing away several star players from the Astros, including Roger Clemens, Lance Berkman, and Gerrit Cole. The Astros are the only team to no hit the Yankees twice, with two combined no-hitters in 2003 and 2022; they are also the only team to no-hit them since 1958. Since 2015, the Astros and Yankees, along with the Boston Red Sox, also tend to have the most wins in the American League.\nSince the Astros moved to the American League in 2013, the two teams have met in the postseason on four separate occasions, all of which have been won by the Astros. The first was the 2015 American League Wild Card Game, which Houston won 3–0; the second was the 2017 American League Championship Series, which Houston won in seven games; and the third was in the 2019 American League Championship Series, with the Astros winning in six games. The animosity between the two teams has only grown stronger in recent years, especially due to the revelations of the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, with some believing that the sign stealing cost the Yankees the 2017 pennant; others, meanwhile, cite that the Yankees' poor offensive numbers meant they were likely to lose regardless. Many Yankees and their fans also accused the Astros of cheating during the 2019 ALCS; however, this was debunked by MLB. The fourth postseason meeting occurred during the 2022 American League Championship Series. Amidst chants by Yankees fans of \"We Want Houston!\" before the series, the Astros dominated the Yankees in a four-game sweep, becoming the first team to beat the Yankees in a postseason series four times.\nNew York Yankees vs. Cleveland Guardians.\nA long-standing rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Guardians (formerly known as the Cleveland Indians) developed in the 1920s, when Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman died on the field after Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Chapman in the head with a fastball. Cleveland would rally following the incident, winning their first World Series title in , but the Yankees' subsequent dynastic run between and prevented Cleveland from attaining further success, other than another World Series title in and several winning seasons that followed. As a result, animosity ensued between the two franchises, pitting the perennially free-spending and dominant Yankees against the more conservative and underdog Indians.\nGeorge Steinbrenner would also be involved in the rivalry, in which he nearly purchased the Indians in the early 1970s; instead, he acquired majority ownership of the Yankees and led the team to seven World Series titles under his ownership. Since the advent of divisional playoffs in , both teams faced off in six postseason series, with the Yankees winning four of the six meetings.\nNational League.\nNational League East.\nAtlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.\nThe Braves–Mets rivalry is a rivalry between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets, who are both members of the National League (NL) East division. The rivalry was particularly fierce during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as both teams competed for postseason berths and, most notably, faced each other in the 1999 NLCS. The rivalry's fierceness would return during the 2022 season, when both teams competed for the NL East division title and first-round bye, with the Braves eventually coming out on top. Historically, the two teams have often been considered the best in their division.\nNew York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies.\nThe Mets–Phillies rivalry is a rivalry between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies. Both clubs are members of MLB's National League (NL) East division. The rivalry between the two clubs is said to be among the most fiercely contested in the NL. The two NL East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and Wild Card races.\nAside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained relatively low-key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. A notable moment in their early meetings was Jim Bunning's perfect game on Father's Day of 1964, the first perfect game in Phillies history, which happened when the Mets were on a losing streak. The Phillies were near the bottom of the NL East when the Mets won the 1969 World Series and the National League pennant in 1973, while the Mets did not enjoy success in the late 1970s when the Phillies won three straight division championships. Although both teams each won a World Series in the 1980s, the Mets were not serious contenders in the Phillies' playoff years (1980, 1981, and 1983), nor did the Phillies seriously contend in the Mets' playoff years (1986 and 1988). The Mets were the Majors' worst team when the Phillies won the NL pennant in 1993, and the Phillies could not post a winning record in either of the Mets' wild-card-winning seasons of 1999 or 2000, when the Mets faced the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series.\nAs the rivalry has intensified in recent years, the teams have battled more often for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 championship was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining. The Phillies broke the Curse of Billy Penn to win the 2008 World Series, while the Mets' last title came in the 1986 World Series.\nIn 2015, the Mets won the National League Championship Series for their fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase. The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for a lopsided season series. The season still provided contentious moments such as, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley in retaliation for Mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers, a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards to a quick pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy.\nThere is a long-standing bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, seen also between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.\nWashington Nationals vs. Philadelphia Phillies.\nThe rivalry between the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies extends back to the Nationals' original tenure as the Montreal Expos. Previously the Expos–Phillies rivalry, the two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent. The Nationals later won the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper's absence. The Phillies currently lead the series 482–445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series: The Expos defeated the Phillies 3–2 in the 1981 NLDS.\nNational League Central.\nI-94 Series: Chicago Cubs vs. Milwaukee Brewers.\nThe Brewers–Cubs rivalry (also known as the I-94 rivalry because the clubs' ballparks are connected by an 83.3-mile drive along Interstate 94) refers to games between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs. The rivalry followed a 1969–97 rivalry between the Brewers, then in the American League, and the Chicago White Sox. The proximity of the two cities and the Bears-Packers football rivalry helped make the Cubs–Brewers rivalry one of baseball's best. In the 2018 season, the teams faced off in a Game 163 for the NL Central division title, which Milwaukee won.\nChicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals–Cubs rivalry refers to games between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. The Cubs lead the series 1,091–1,044 through , while the Cardinals lead in National League pennants with 19 against 17 for the Cubs. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to World Series successes, having won 11 championships, while the Cubs have only won 3. Cardinals–Cubs games see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis' Busch Stadium or Chicago's Wrigley Field. When the National League split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. They had 3 pennant races in 1930, 1935, and 1945. The two teams met in the World Series of the nineteenth century when the Cardinals, then known as the Browns, were part of the American Association. The teams tied in 1885 and St. Louis won in 1886. St. Louis, however, has officially vacated their history from the AA. The first modern postseason meeting between the two teams was the 2015 NLDS, which the Cubs won 3 games to 1 before losing the 2015 NLCS to the New York Mets.\nPittsburgh Pirates vs. Cincinnati Reds.\nThe Pirates–Reds rivalry is a historic series between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds. At one point in time was one of the fiercest matchups in the National League during the 1970s; both teams often met in the postseason multiple times prior to both being realigned to the National League Central in 1993. The two teams date far into the infancy of MLB, having both been founded in the 1880s, and first met during the 1900 MLB season. Both teams combine for 10 World Series championships and 18 pennants. The Pirates and Reds met 5 times during the NLCS in 1970, 1972, 1975, 1979, and 1990. Most recently; both teams met again during the 2013 NL Wild Card Game.\nAs of 2023, the Pirates currently lead the rivalry 1141–1113, However; the Reds lead in postseason wins 13–8.\nNational League West.\nLos Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants.\nThe Dodgers–Giants rivalry began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles for financial reasons, among others. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in economic, cultural, and political arenas, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation.\nEach team's ability to have endured for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth in intensity from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history.\nUnlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers–Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams, and remains immensely fierce today. While the Giants have more wins, and World Series titles in franchise history, the Dodgers have won the National League West twenty times compared to the Giants' eight, and a National League best twenty-four league pennants. The 2014 World Series was the Giants' third championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers' have won six since the move; the most recent in the 2020 World Series. The 2021 NLDS marked the first time the two teams has ever played each other in the postseason with Los Angeles beating San Francisco in a winner-take-all Game 5.\nI-5 Series: Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Diego Padres.\nThe Dodgers–Padres rivalry, occasionally called the I-5 rivalry due to Los Angeles and San Diego being the two biggest cities in Southern California, lying approximately 130 miles apart along Interstate 5. For much of the rivalry's history, matchups had often been lopsided in favor of the Dodgers, however; recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego (driving from Dodger Stadium to Petco Park can be done by simply taking Interstate 5). San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for their sports teams as both the Chargers and the Clippers both relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to find a secure future in San Diego.\nThe Dodgers currently lead the series 504–412, although both teams have a series win in the postseason (Los Angeles won the 2020 NLDS, while San Diego returned the favor in 2022). Off the field, the rivalry has been just as competitive, as the two teams have aggressively battled on the trade market and free agency over star players, such as Juan Soto, Mookie Betts, Max Scherzer, and Trea Turner.\nArizona Diamondbacks vs. Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe rivalry between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers developed due to proximity when the Diamondbacks came into the league in 1998. It peaked and became one of the fiercest divisional matchups for several years in the 2010s. During the 2010s, animosity rose immensely between both sides, resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another or escalating into several bench-clearing brawls. Infamously; after eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013; multiple Dodgers' players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field. The two sides met during the 2017 National League Division Series as the Diamondbacks were no match for LA as they were swept 3–0 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series. The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series, with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3–0 sweep of their own en route to the World Series. The Dodgers lead the series 259–193 with a 3–3 tie in the postseason.\nDue to not having a team until 1998, many Arizona residents supported the Dodgers prior to the creation of the Diamondbacks franchise. Because of this, there is often a split crowd when they play Los Angeles at their home park, Chase Field, due in no small part to the Dodgers' extensive fanbase across the southwestern United States.\nInter-Divisional.\nSt. Louis Cardinals vs. Los Angeles Dodgers.\nBoth the Dodgers and Cardinals are two of the oldest franchises in MLB, having first met during the 1900 season during the league's infancy; the Cardinals in 1882 and the Dodgers (originally known as the Bridegrooms) in 1883. Historically; both teams have not played in the same division; however frequent close pennant races and matchups in the postseason caused the rivalry to grow in intensity through the decades. This was on display from 1963 to 1968 when either team represented the National League in the World Series or the 2000s when the two teams regularly met in the postseason. Both teams have met each other 1,975 times with 24 postseason games between them. The Cardinals currently have the most regular season wins at 1002, and the most postseason wins at 14.\nInterleague.\nBackground.\nEarly discussions about interleague play.\nInterleague or interconference matchups have long been the norm in other professional sports leagues such as the National Football League. Regular-season interleague play was discussed for baseball's major leagues as early as the 1930s. In December 1956, Major League owners considered a proposal by Cleveland general manager and minority-owner Hank Greenberg to implement limited interleague play beginning in 1958.\nUnder Greenberg's proposal, each team would continue to play 154-games in the season, 126 of which would be within the league, and 28 against the 8 clubs in the other league. The interleague games would all be played during a period immediately following the All-Star Game. Notably, under Greenberg's proposal, all results would count in regular season game standings and league statistics. While this proposal was not adopted, the current system shares many elements. Bill Veeck predicted in 1963 that Major League Baseball would someday have interleague play. The concept did not take hold until the 1990s (at least in part as an effort to renew the public's interest in MLB following the 1994 players' strike).\nFirst Interleague games.\nMLB's first regular season interleague game took place on June 12, 1997, when the Texas Rangers hosted the San Francisco Giants at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. There were four interleague games on the schedule that night, but the other three were played on the West Coast, so the Giants–Rangers matchup started a few hours earlier than the others. Texas' Darren Oliver threw the game's first pitch and San Francisco outfielder Glenallen Hill was the first designated hitter used in a regular-season game by a National League team. San Francisco's Stan Javier hit the first home run in interleague play, and the Giants won the game 4–3.\nFor the first five seasons of Interleague Play, each division played against the same division from the other league (NL East vs. AL East, NL Central vs. AL Central and NL West vs. AL West), typically scheduled to alternate between home and away in consecutive years. However, in 2002, a new format to Interleague Play was instituted where teams play Interleague games against various divisions. Matchups which had been of particular interest prior to this format—mainly geographic rivals—were preserved. This is expected to be the continuing format of the interleague schedule. Corresponding divisions however, were skipped once when this rotation began, but were put back in the rotation in 2006.\nFrom 2002 to 2012, all interleague games were played prior to the All-Star Game. Most games were played in June, though May games have been scheduled since 2005. Among the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \"home and home\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these matches feature two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six are regional matches at greater distance, four of which are in the same state.\nStarting in 2023, MLB teams will play every other team in baseball at least once.\nEast.\nBattle of the Beltways: Baltimore Orioles vs. Washington Nationals.\nKnown as the Beltway Battle and as the Battle of the Beltways, after Washington's Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and Baltimore's Baltimore Beltway (I-695). The two teams first met in 2006, one year after the Montreal Expos relocated from Montreal to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals. Much of this rivalry is dominated by off-the field issues. Baltimore owner Peter Angelos publicly opposed relocating the Expos to Washington, which he believed was a part of his territorial rights after the departure of the second incarnation of the Washington Senators after the 1971 season. There are also controversies surrounding the value of the Nationals' television rights and their coverage on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network.\nSubway Series: New York Mets vs. New York Yankees.\nThe Mets–Yankees rivalry is the latest incarnation of the Subway Series, the competition between New York City's Major League Baseball teams, the AL Yankees and NL Mets. Until Interleague play started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the teams have met in every season since 1997 and faced off in the 2000 World Series with the Yankees winning in five games.\nCitrus Series: Miami Marlins vs. Tampa Bay Rays.\nThe Citrus Series is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball. The Marlins entered the league in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, while the Rays had their first season in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first meeting between the two teams took place on June 22, 1998, at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida during the Rays' inaugural season. The Marlins moved into Marlins Park in the 2012 season; from 1998 to 2011, the games were played at the NFL's Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium (as it is currently named), though it has been known by several names in its existence. Overall, The Rays lead the series with 75 wins to the Marlins' 58.\nCentral.\nBorder Battle: Milwaukee Brewers vs. Minnesota Twins.\nThe Border Battle is an annual interleague rivalry between the Milwaukee Brewers (NL-Central) and the Minnesota Twins (AL-Central). The rivalry started and was most heated when the Brewers were still in the American League before transitioning to the National League.\nCrosstown Classic: Chicago White Sox vs. Chicago Cubs.\nThe Cubs–White Sox rivalry (also known as the Wintrust Crosstown Cup, Crosstown Classic, The Windy City Showdown, Red Line Series, City Series, Crosstown Series, Crosstown Cup or Crosstown Showdown) refers to the rivalry between two Major League Baseball teams that play their home games in Chicago, Illinois. The Chicago Cubs of the NL play their home games at Wrigley Field located on the city's North side, while the Chicago White Sox of the AL play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field on the city's South side. The terms \"North Siders\" and \"South Siders\" are synonymous with the respective teams and their fans, setting up an enduring rivalry. The Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line runs north–south through Chicago's neighborhoods, stopping at Wrigley Field on Addison Street and Guaranteed Rate Field on 35th Street.\nNotably this rivalry actually predates the Interleague Play Era, with the only postseason meeting occurring in the 1906 World Series. It was the first World Series between teams from the same city. The White Sox won the series 4 games to 2, over the highly favored Cubs who had won a record 116 games during the regular season. The rivalry continued through of exhibition games, culminating in the Crosstown Classic from 1985 to 1995, in which the White Sox were undefeated at 10–0–2. The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 72–64.\nBattle of Ohio: Cincinnati Reds vs. Cleveland Guardians.\nThe Ohio Cup is between the National League (NL)'s Cincinnati Reds and the American League (AL)'s Cleveland Guardians. Both teams' cities are about 250 miles away via I-71. As of the 2022 season, the Guardians are ahead of the Reds by 17 with an all-time rivalry record 71–54.\nShow-Me Series: St. Louis Cardinals vs. Kansas City Royals.\nThe rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League and Kansas City Royals of the American League is a Major League Baseball series sometimes known as the I-70 Series or the Show-Me Series. This rivalry is so called because the two cities are located in the state of Missouri, whose nickname is the \"Show Me State\", and both cities are located along Interstate 70. They played each other for the first time in the 1985 World Series, which saw the Royals overcome a 3–1 series deficit to win in seven games. Owing to their geographical proximity, the teams face each other every regular season in interleague play.\nThis prominent rivalry began with Royals' successes in the early '80's and fueled by the Royals' victory over the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. The series is still a source of contention among fans, notably the controversial call in the bottom of the ninth of game 6 in which Jorge Orta was called safe on a play that replays later showed him out. A Royals rally let them tie and later win the game and then later the series.\nWest.\nFreeway Series: Los Angeles Angels vs. Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe term Freeway Series refers to a series of baseball games played between Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels of the American League and Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The Freeway series is extremely popular in Los Angeles and normally sells out their games due to the close proximity of both teams and their fans. The closest the two teams came to playing in a World Series together was in , when they both made their respective league championship series before losing. Although the Dodgers have been the more historically successful franchise, the Angels hold a slight edge in the head-to-head advantage in meetings between the two teams.\nBay Bridge Series: Oakland Athletics vs. San Francisco Giants.\nThe Bay Bridge Series is the name of the games played between—and rivalry of—the Oakland Athletics of the AL and San Francisco Giants of the NL. The series takes its name from the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to the Chicago series (Cubs–White Sox), or the New York series (Mets–Yankees), where animosity runs high. While many fans have a very strong dislike for the other team, some others actually like both. Bay Area baseball fans tend to disagree with each other on this topic.\nThe series is also occasionally referred to as the \"BART Series\" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name \"BART Series\" has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the \"Bay Bridge Series\".\nOriginally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series in which the Athletics won their most recent championship and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of interleague play in 1997. Through August 2015, the A's have won 53 games, and the Giants have won 50.\nHouston Astros vs. Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe rivalry between the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers initially begun as a divisional matchup, but hostility waned following Houston's realignment to the American League. In 2017, the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros won the championship in 7 games. The rivalry re-intensified after the Astros' widely publicized sign stealing scandal, in which it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, including during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans. The Dodgers lead the all-time series 400–334; both teams are tied in postseason wins 6–6.\nVedder Cup: San Diego Padres vs. Seattle Mariners.\nAn unlikely matchup between two interleague opponents; the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners. The rivalry has been a part of local hometown lore; often called the Eddie Vedder Cup in regards to both Seattle and San Diego being hometowns for Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who lived in San Diego County during the latter half of his adolescence before forming Pearl Jam in Seattle (ironically, Vedder himself is a fan of the Chicago Cubs). The two teams have met each other every season excluding 2017 since interleague play was introduced in 1997. Following the introduction of interleague play; one of the 15 naturalized rivalries designated were to include Seattle and San Diego. The rivalry often involved both teams in the depths of playoff failure as the Padres failed to win a single playoff series from 1999 to 2019, while the Mariners had failed to make a single playoff appearance from 2002 to 2021; thus forcing both teams to compete for draft picks and prospects as they also share the Peoria Sports Complex as their spring training facility. Though very little on the surface initially linked any animosity between the two teams as they play in separate leagues and both cities lie approximately 1,250 miles apart. The rivalry often exists with more respect between the two teams and fans alike as more of a humorous contest for both sides. The Mariners currently lead the series 62–61.\nHistorical.\nAmerican League.\nKansas City Royals vs. New York Yankees.\nDespite never playing in the same division, the Royals and Yankees developed quite a disdain for each other from mid 70s through the mid 80s. Starting in 1976, they met in the American League Championship Series for four out of the five seasons from 1976 through 1980, with the Yankees winning the first three, and Kansas City sweeping New York in 1980. The rivalry continued in 1983, which featured the Pine Tar Game, in which Billy Martin requested that the umpires inspect George Brett's bat after he hit a two-run home run in the top of the ninth that gave Kansas City a 4–3 advantage. The umpires ruled that the amount of pine tar on the bat exceeded the amount allowed by rule, nullified Brett's home run, and called him out. As Brett was the third out in the ninth inning with the home team in the lead, the game ended with a Yankees win. The Royals protested the game, and American League president Lee MacPhail upheld their protest. MacPhail ordered that the game be continued from the point of Brett's home run. The game was resumed 25 days later on August 18, and officially ended with the Royals winning 5–4. The rivalry died when many of the main characters in the rivalry retired or moved to other teams via free agency (a new concept in the early 1980s). The Royals also went on a long re-build after team owner Ewing Kauffman died in 1993. From 1999 to 2010, Kansas City did not win a single series against New York.\nNational League.\nCincinnati Reds vs. Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Dodgers–Reds rivalry was one of the most intense during the 1970s through the early 1990s. They often competed for the NL West division title. From 1970 to 1990, they had eleven 1–2 finishes in the standings, with seven of them being within 5½ games or fewer. Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span, combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from –, most notably as the Big Red Machine teams clashed frequently with the Tommy Lasorda-era Dodgers teams. Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said, \"I don't think there's a rivalry like ours in either league. The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers' natural rivals, but I don't think the feeling is there anymore. It's not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers.\" The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central. However, they did face one another in the 1995 NLDS.\nMontreal Expos vs. Philadelphia Phillies.\nThe Montreal Expos and Philadelphia Phillies were originally rivals as charter members of the NL East following the 1969 expansion in which the Expos were one of four new teams added to the league. The two teams grew a history of fights and pitches repeatedly tossed at one another, culminating in both teams regularly battling for control of the division during much of the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Notable games such as Mike Schmidt's game-winning home run helped Philadelphia clinch the division during their penultimate game against the Expos during the tail end of the 1980 season. The Expos responded the following season by beating the Phillies in the NLDS 3–2. The rivalry regrew following the Expos' relocation to Washington DC in 2005 to become the Nationals franchise.\nPhiladelphia Phillies vs. Pittsburgh Pirates.\nThe rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the NL. The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered play in 1887, four years after the Phillies.\nThe Phillies and Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in . During the period of two-division play (1969–), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.\nHowever, after the Pirates moved to the National League Central in , the rivalry ended. The teams have since faced each other only in two series per year and the rivalry has effectively died in the years since the Pirates moved out of the NL East.\nSt. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets.\nThe rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Mets peaked during the 1980s when both teams contended for National League East supremacy. The rivalry began with the 1983 trade that brought Keith Hernandez from the Cardinals to the Mets, essentially turning the latter into contenders. Between 1985 and 1988, the division was dominated by either of the two teams, and in three of those years, the NL East winner went on to the World Series. In 1994, the Cardinals were moved to the National League Central, and the rivalry faded soon after. The two teams would meet in the and National League Championship Series, briefly rekindling the rivalry.\nInterleague.\nToronto Blue Jays vs. Montreal Expos.\nBeing the only two Canadian baseball teams in the major leagues, a rivalry between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos was inevitable. This rivalry was assisted by the presence of the Pearson Cup, an award that was given to the winner of a special midseason match (later incorporated into the MLB interleague schedule). However, this rivalry was subdued, as the two teams played in different leagues. In 2004, the rivalry came to an end when the Expos moved to Washington to become the Washington Nationals.\nBoston Red Sox vs. St. Louis Cardinals.\nThis rivalry was mainly played out in the World Series, in which the two teams met four times and split two series. The Cardinals won the first two meetings; in , St. Louis prevailed in large part to Enos Slaughter's mad dash late in Game 7, and in , pitcher Bob Gibson outlasted Red Sox ace Jim Lonborg in Game 7 to dash Boston's \"Impossible Dream\" season. The Red Sox then won the next two meetings; in , Boston ended their 86-year title drought with a four-game sweep, and in , they won their third World Series in a ten-year span with a six-game win, capped off by winning the championship at Fenway Park for the first time since .\nLos Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Yankees.\nThe Dodgers–Yankees rivalry is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States.\nNew York Yankees vs. San Francisco Giants.\nThe rivalry between the New York Giants and New York Yankees was briefly intense during the 1920s as both teams not only inhabited New York City but also, for a time, the same ballpark. During that era the opportunities for them to meet could only have been in a World Series. Both teams kicked off the first Subway Series between the NL and AL in 1921. The teams met once since the Giants moved to California, in the 1962 World Series, with the Yankees winning in seven. Following the World Series matchup, the rivalry has cooled off greatly in the years afterwards.\nPhiladelphia Phillies vs. Oakland Athletics.\nThe rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Oakland Athletics, also known as the Philadelphia City Series was at its most intense from 1901 to 1955, when the Oakland Athletics played in Philadelphia. The rivalry was significant not only because both teams played in Philadelphia, but because of the strong competition between the National and American Leagues. The competition between the leagues was so strong that the A's and Phillies did not play at all from 1901 to 1902 because of legal warring between the two parties. Related to growing tensions between the rival leagues, superstar Nap Lajoie had played for several years on the Phillies, but was displeased with the salary cap of $2,400 placed by the National League. When the American League was formed in 1901 and the A's joined it, Lajoie was offered a contract by Frank Hough of the Athletics on behalf of A's manager Connie Mack. When asked by a reporter what motivated him to leave, he responded \"[Frank] Hough offered me $24,000 ($682,656 in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry!\" As a result, the Phillies filed a lawsuit to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court banning Lajoie from playing for any professional team. However, the decree only applied to teams in Pennsylvania, so Lajoie signed with the Cleveland Bronchos. When the decree expired, the Phillies chose not to file it again, and Lajoie left Cleveland to sign with the A's.\nWhen the National League and American League merged in 1903, the rivalry became more friendly. Games between the two teams were played in many different stadiums throughout Philadelphia as older ones fell into disrepair and newer ones were built. Stadiums included Shibe Park, Philadelphia Park, as well as others. The final City Series game was played in 1954. In 1955, the Athletics moved to Kansas City after another dismal season in Philadelphia. The rivalry continued in spring training games until the Athletics moved to their permanent spring training facility in Mesa, Arizona. The rivalry has effectively died since then."

        "text": "The 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics venues are divided between two \"clusters\" located in and around Sochi, Russia.\nVenues.\nCoastal Cluster.\nLocated in the Adler City District of Sochi, Imeretinsky Valley, on the Black Sea, the Olympic Park houses the main Olympic Stadium used for the Games' ceremonies, and venues for indoor sports such as hockey, figure skating, curling, and speed skating. It also houses training facilities, the Olympic Village, the international broadcasting centre, and other amenities. The park is designed so that all of the venues are accessible within walking distance of each other. The venues are situated around a water basin containing a fountain known as \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\"; designed by California-based WET (which also designed the cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City), the fountain measures 5.3 meters in diameter with a capacity of about 700,000 gallons of water, featuring more than 250 nozzles and jet systems that can create fog and choreographed water displays set to music.\nThe Olympic Village.\nThe Sochi 2014 Olympic Village was a comprehensive setup, consisting of three distinct \"villages\" designed to accommodate athletes and delegates for the Winter Olympics: Usadba Coastal Olympic Village in the coastal cluster, Mountain Olympic Village and Sloboda Endurance Village in the mountain cluster.\nThe Usadba Coastal Olympic Village, located on the Black Sea coast in the Imereti Lowlands, consisted of 47 buildings covering 72 hectares. This village had the capacity to host up to 2,000 athletes and delegates. During the Olympic Winter Games, it housed athletes competing in hockey, curling, figure skating, speed skating, and short track. Yelena Isinbaeva served as the \"mayor\" of this village, and its mascot was the Polar Bear.\nThe Mountain Olympic Village was the largest of the three, able to accommodate up to 3,000 athletes and delegates. It was home to athletes participating in alpine skiing, bobsleigh, freestyle, luge, Nordic combined, skeleton, ski jumping, and snowboarding. This village also featured the International Zone for interactions between athletes, media representatives, dignitaries, and visitors. It was conveniently located near the Rosa Khutor cable car stations. The village's mayor was Svetlana Zhurova and its mascot was the Leopard.\nSloboda Endurance Village, situated near the cross-country skiing and biathlon competition complex, was designed to provide accommodation for up to 1,100 athletes in cross-country skiing and biathlon, along with delegation members. Maxim Chudov was appointed as the mayor, and the village's mascot was the Hare.\nIn total, the Olympic Village had the capacity to house up to 6,000 athletes from 85 nations. The construction of the Olympic Village was undertaken by Basic Element, with Deputy CEO Andrey Elinson being in charge for the whole development. For his \"significant contribution to the preparation and conduct of the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Sochi\", Elinson was awarded the Order of Friendship by the President of the Russian Federation in December 2014. The total cost of Sochi 2014 Olympic village's construction was $778M\nUpdates.\nEnvironmental protection measures are being used in venue construction. These include being climate-neutral, games in harmony with nature, zero waste, and raising environmental awareness in preparing and hosting the 2014 Games. The 100th environmental protection measure was completed in October 2010. Slopes at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort were completed on 26 November 2010. A European Ski competition took place in early 2011 while a World Cup event took place in 2012.\nPost-Olympic usage.\nIn October 2010, it was announced that the area around the Coastal Cluster would be used as part of a Formula 1 racing circuit to hold its first race in 2014. The Winter Games were completed with no problems and the first Grand Prix at the Sochi Autodrom took place on 12 October 2014, which was won by Lewis Hamilton and the fastest lap was set by Valtteri Bottas.\nThe World Chess Championship 2014 was held in Sochi in November.\nOn 2 December 2010, FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) awarded their 2018 World Cup to Russia. Among the venues to be used will be Central Stadium (known as Sochi Olympic Stadium in Russia's bid package to FIFA), which will be expanded to seat 47,659 after the Games."

        "text": "John Patrick Harrington (April 15, 1921 – January 8, 1992) was a professional American football end and defensive end who played two seasons for the Cleveland Browns and Chicago Rockets in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Harrington attended Marquette University and became the football team's captain in 1942. He joined the military in 1944 and played for Air Force teams in 1944 and 1945. He was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals in 1945 but instead signed with the Browns before the team's inaugural season in 1946. Harrington played in one season for the Browns before he was traded to the Rockets in 1947.\nEarly life and college career.\nHarrington was born and grew up in Reedsburg, Wisconsin; he also attended high school there. After graduating, he went to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and played his first football game for the college team in 1941, when he was a sophomore. Harrington, who played as an end, had two touchdown catches in one of his first games against Kansas. In 1942, he was named the Marquette football team's captain.\nHarrington then entered the Second Air Force during World War II and was the captain of the unit's Superbombers football team, who played in the Treasury Bond Bowl in 1944. In 1945, Harrington played with the Fourth Air Force's football team, the Flyers.\nProfessional career.\nHarrington was drafted in the eighth round of the 1945 NFL Draft by the Chicago Cardinals, but did not play for the team. In March 1946, the Cleveland Browns of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) announced that they had signed Harrington. He reported to the team's training camp several days late to finish summer school studies at Marquette, to which he had returned after his discharge from the Army. Competition in training camp was intense, and Harrington was thought to have little chance of making the Browns' roster. His number was not listed in the program for the Browns' first game against the Miami Seahawks, but Harrington put in a solid defensive performance in the 44–0 victory, tackling Miami's backs for losses several times. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year.\nBefore the 1947 season began, the Browns traded Harrington and Jim Daniell to the AAFC's Chicago Rockets for halfback Bill Boedeker."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 1992–93",
        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured Zimbabwe between 15 and 25 October 1992. The series was played as a prelude for India's tour of South Africa, and included just one Test match and one One Day International (ODI).\nThe tour began with a 50-over warm-up match, which the touring Indians won by 16 runs over the \"Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI\". \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" criticised the \"lifeless pitch\" in the Test match, saying \"both [bowling] attacks were rendered innocuous\". Zimbabwe's captain, David Houghton top-scored for his side in their first innings, scoring the country's maiden Test century of 121. Zimbabwe established a 149-run first innings lead, but the match ended as a draw. By drawing the match, Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid defeat in their inaugural Test match since Australia won the very first Test match in 1877. In the solitary ODI, India won by 30 runs.\nFollowing the series, India travelled to South Africa, becoming the first team to tour the country for 23 years after an international boycott due to the country's apartheid policies, while Zimbabwe hosted New Zealand. Zimbabwe achieved their first victory in Test cricket the following summer, when they beat the touring Pakistan team.\nTour matches.\n50 overs: Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI v Indians.\nThe Indians were reduced to 76/5 after being put in to bat first, losing Mohammad Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar and Sanjay Manjrekar cheaply. Vice-captain Ravi Shastri then joined by Pravin Amre put together 47 runs for the sixth wicket helping their team go past 200. Shastri also shone with the ball returning figures of 2/21 in his ten overs restricting Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI 17 short of the target. For the latter, Gavin Briant remained unbeaten on 51.\nTest series.\nOnly Test.\nThis was the first Test match to have three appointed umpires. British company National Grid sponsored English umpire Dickie Bird so that he could fly to Zimbabwe for the match, the 48th Test match he had umpired. This equalled the world record for the most Test matches umpired. As a result, Bird umpired the whole match while the two Zimbabwean umpires present, Kantilal Kanjee and Ian Robinson, took to the field on alternate days. Because this was Zimbabwe's first ever Test match, ten of their eleven players were making their Test debut. The eleventh player, John Traicos, had previously played for South Africa before they were excluded from Test cricket in 1970. He was the 14th cricketer to play Test cricket for two different countries, and he broke the record for the longest period between Test appearances: 22 years and 222 days.\nZimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat first, and India struggled to bowl for the first two days, lacking match practice and still adjusting to the altitude in Harare. Kevin Arnott and Grant Flower opened the batting for Zimbabwe with a 100-run partnership, though both batted cautiously and slowly. India took three wickets on the first day to leave Zimbabwe at 3/188 at stumps. A wicket fell early on the second day to bring David Houghton to the crease. Though Houghton, a mainstay in Zimbabwe's team, was known for aggressive batting, he curbed his instincts to score a slow maiden Test century. He reached his hundred after 305 minutes of batting, and he batted in total for 414 minutes, playing India's spin bowlers especially well. Houghton was the first player to score a century his country's inaugural Test match since Charles Bannerman did for Australia in 1877. Houghton and Andy Flower scored 165 runs in 68 overs for the sixth wicket, which took Zimbabwe to stumps on the second day, but all five remaining wickets fell quickly on the morning of the third day. Zimbabwe's first innings total was 456 all out, which easily beat 245 (scored by Australia in their first Test match) to become the highest ever score by a team in their inaugural Test match.\nThe only fast bowler in Zimbabwe's team was Eddo Brandes, who opened the bowling when Zimbabwe took to the field, but broke down after two overs and didn't take any further part in the match. Regardless, Zimbabwe's other bowlers excelled, particularly John Traicos and Gary Crocker. Traicos dismissed Sachin Tendulkar caught and bowled for a duck then had India's captain Mohammad Azharuddin caught at slip for nine, while Crocker only conceded 11 runs in his first 13 overs, nine of which were maiden overs. India were reduced to 4/93 at stumps, still needing to score another 164 runs to avoid the follow-on.\nTraicos took three more wickets on day four to claim a five-wicket haul. He took five wickets for 86 runs in 50 overs, the best bowling figures of the match, but Zimbabwe lost the initiative when they decided to take a new ball, switching from Traicos to their seam bowlers. This change suited the Indian batsmen, Kapil Dev and Sanjay Manjrekar. Kapil Dev scored 60 runs and Manjrekar scored a century. Manjrekar's century was the fifth slowest Test century, and the slowest ever by an Indian batsman. It took him 500 minutes of batting, and he had faced 397 balls. Manjrekar reached his century just before stumps on the fourth day, and India finished the day with 7/278.\nManjrekar was caught at backward point early on day five, and India were all out for 307 just 45 minutes later. As there was not enough time left for a result either, Zimbabwe slowly batted out a draw. In so doing, Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid losing their first Test match since Australia in 1876/77, when the first Test match was played.\nODI series.\nOnly ODI.\nThe match was played in front of a crowd of 8,000, and Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to field. After India lost both of their opening batsmen with only one run scored, their innings was built around Sanjay Manjrekar, who top-scored for India with 70 runs. This lifted India to 239 all out. The Flower brothers (Andy and Grant) opened the batting for Zimbabwe and got them off to a good start, but after the middle order collapsed only Gary Crocker showed any resistance against the Indian bowlers. Zimbabwe were bowled out for 209 and lost by 30 runs."

He was most recently the offensive coordinator at Alabama. Before that, he was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Notre Dame, where he played college football from 2010 to 2013.\nEarly years.\nRees was born to Bill and Susan (née Cantwell) Rees in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Lake Bluff, Illinois. His father played college football at Ohio Wesleyan and served as an assistant coach at Northwestern and UCLA. Tommy played football at Lake Forest High School. As a senior in 2009, he completed 215 of 308 passes for 2,572 yards and 23 touchdowns while only throwing 3 interceptions the entire season. Rees had several explosive games including a 526-yard, six-touchdown performance against Bradford.

Rees finished the game with 334 yards and four touchdown passes but threw a costly interception in the waning minutes of the game which sealed the victory for the Golden Hurricane. Rees led the Irish to victories in his first four starts at quarterback, including upsets of Utah and USC, culminating in a 33–17 victory over Miami in the Sun Bowl. He finished the season with 1,106 yards passing, 12 touchdowns, and eight interceptions.\n2011 season.\nIn the 2011 season, Rees passed for 2,869 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. Notre Dame went 8–4 in the regular season with a bowl loss. Andrew Hendrix and Everett Golson competed with Rees for the starting QB position in the 2012 season.\nAfter Michigan's comeback in the September 10 rivalry game, the derisive nickname \"Turnover Tommy\" began to circulate, which stuck with Rees following his performance in 2011, and through his college career. Despite this reputation, Rees finished the season with a completion percentage of 65.5%, a second to the Irish record of 68% held by Jimmy Clausen. Rees' 14 interceptions this season was a tie for 11th in the FBS.\n2012 season.\nRees was suspended by head coach Brian Kelly for the first game of the 2012 season after the junior quarterback was arrested and charged with resisting law enforcement and illegal consumption of alcohol by a minor after fleeing from an off-campus party. Everett Golson was named the starter for the opening game against Navy in Dublin, Ireland. Golson played most of the second game of the 2012 season against Purdue but was injured leading Rees to come in. Rees entered the game to a cascade of boos yet exited after piloting the game-winning drive, which ended with a winning field goal for Notre Dame. However, after the game, Kelly indicated that the team was staying with their initial starter, Golson, for the third game of the 2012 season at Michigan State. Rees started two games that year as Notre Dame made the BCS title game. All 13 games during the 2012 season were vacated soon after for use of ineligible players.\n2013 season.\nOn June 5, 2013, it was announced Rees would start at quarterback for the 2013 season.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Redskins.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft, Rees was signed by the Washington Redskins on May 10, 2014.

On January 14, 2020, Rees was officially promoted to offensive coordinator, replacing Chip Long. In his first season as offensive coordinator, the Irish finished the 2020 campaign 10–2 with a loss to eventual national champion Alabama in the College Football Playoff semifinal.\nAlabama.\nOn February 3, 2023, CBS reported that Rees had reached a deal with Alabama to become the offensive coordinator for the Crimson Tide.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn February 5, 2024, Rees was hired by the Cleveland Browns as a pass game specialist and tight ends coach.\nPersonal life.\nRees' father, Bill, works for the University of Notre Dame.

        "text": "The Stony Brook Seawolves men's lacrosse team represents Stony Brook University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college lacrosse. The Seawolves are led by Anthony Gilardi, who became the team's head coach prior to the 2020 season after eight seasons at Towson. Stony Brook currently competes in the Colonial Athletic Association and plays its home games on Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.\nAlthough a club team has existed since 1978, Stony Brook established a Division III program in 1983. Stony Brook entered Division I status in 1988. The team's most successful season came in 2010, when they were ranked in the top ten of the polls and appeared in their second NCAA Tournament, advancing to the quarterfinals and losing 10–9 to Virginia at home at the doorstep of a Final Four appearance. Overall, the team has won six regular-season titles in its former home of the America East Conference and appeared in three NCAA Tournaments.\nTeam history.\nPre-Division I era (1983–1988).\nStony Brook University first fielded a men's lacrosse team in the 1983 season at the NCAA Division III level. Prior to that, a men's club lacrosse team had been started in 1978 by student Frank Ross. John Ziegler was the program's first head coach, going 30–10 over a span of three seasons. Before the 1986 season, Ziegler was replaced by Bruce Casagrande. Casagrande scheduled three Division I teams in 1986 and 1987, and Stony Brook defeated Ohio State 14–6 on March 21, 1987 at Huntington High School. Casagrande led the team during its transition from club status to official NCAA Division I program.\nJohn Espey era (1988–2004).\nHead coach John Espey took over for Casagrande beginning in 1988. Under Espey, Stony Brook expanded its facilities, recruiting efforts, and strength of schedule in order to build the program. By 1998, the program had achieved full funding status, allowing it to allocate the NCAA maximum of 12.6 scholarships for current athletes. In 2000, Stony Brook joined the ECAC Lacrosse League, but the Seawolves only played two seasons in the conference. Stony Brook joined the America East Conference and played its first season there in 2002.\nIn the Seawolves' inaugural America East season, the team was picked to finish first in the conference preseason poll. Stony Brook headed into the America East Tournament at 8–6, and beat Hartford and Albany to reach the first NCAA Tournament in program history. In the first round of the tournament, Cornell ran away with a 12–3 victory to end the Seawolves' season with a 10–7 record.\nEspey resigned in 2004 after 16 seasons as head coach. In his final two years, Stony Brook was eliminated in the America East semifinals both times.\nLars Tiffany period (2005–2006).\nOn August 10, 2004, Penn State assistant head coach Lars Tiffany was named as Espey's successor. Tiffany spent two seasons as the Seawolves' head coach and did not return to the NCAA Tournament in either season, losing to Albany in the America East finals in 2005 and in the America East semifinals in 2006. Tiffany left in August 2006 to accept the head coaching job at his alma mater, Brown University, going 18–13 in his two seasons at Stony Brook.\nRick Sowell era (2007–2011).\nSt. John's head coach Rick Sowell was named Stony Brook's fifth head coach on August 15, 2006. In Sowell's debut, the Seawolves lost at home 15–7 to the #8 Virginia Cavaliers. However, Stony Brook eventually won five games in a row and found themselves ranked as high as #18 in the polls. The Seawolves tumbled out of the rankings after suffering four conference losses, and took the fourth seed in the conference tournament, being blown out 17–5 by Albany in the semifinals to end their season at 8–5.\nIn 2008, the Seawolves finished 7–7 and suffered another semifinal loss to Albany. The 2009 season saw Stony Brook come closest to returning to the NCAA Tournament since their 2002 appearance, but the Seawolves ended the season at 9–6 after losing to #11 UMBC in the America East Championship.\n2010 season: NCAA Tournament Quarterfinals.\nStony Brook began the 2010 season unranked, beating Siena 21–14 in its season opener before losing the next game, 13–8 to #2 Virginia. The Seawolves then won three in a row, including a 16–12 victory over #16 Delaware, before losing the next two games 13–12 to Denver and 12–9 to #9 Cornell. With a 4–3 record, Stony Brook beat Bryant 8–7 before running the table in America East play, going undefeated including a 15–0 clobbering at Albany and a 16–10 win over Vermont. The Seawolves entered the America East Tournament at 10–3 having won six games in a row, and their winning streak became eight after defeating Vermont and Albany in the playoffs to reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2002.\nStony Brook was ranked #6 in the country heading into the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. The Seawolves were given the #8 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

A record-setting 10,024 people attended the quarterfinal game at LaValle Stadium.\nThe Seawolves finished 2010 with a program-record 13 wins, going undefeated in America East play for the first time. Over a week after the loss to Virginia, Sowell's contract was extended through the 2015 season.\n2011 season.\nStony Brook was ranked #5 in the USILA Coaches Poll heading into the season, and was unanimously picked to finish in first place in the America East.\nThe season opened with a top-5 battle at LaValle Stadium, with #5 Stony Brook hosting #1 Virginia. The Seawolves blew an early lead and lost 11–10 in overtime but recovered to win their next three games over Marist, Delaware, and St. John's. Stony Brook was then shocked on the road, falling 9–8 to unranked Towson before losing to #10 Cornell at home in a 17–9 blowout.\nSitting at 3–3, Stony Brook would go undefeated in America East play for a second straight year to end the regular season at 8–3 as the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament. After defeating Binghamton 12–8 in the semifinals, Stony Brook was stunned in an 11–10 loss to Hartford in the America East Championship off a last-second goal by Ryan Compitello, whose brother Tom played for Stony Brook at the same time.\nThe Seawolves ended the season ranked #17 and did not qualify for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, ending their season in disappointment. A month after the season ended, Sowell announced his resignation in the middle of his contract to accept the head coaching position at Navy. Sowell was 47–26 in five seasons as Stony Brook head coach.\nThe Jim Nagle years (2012–2019).\nColgate head coach Jim Nagle was named as Sowell's successor eleven days later on June 20, 2011.\n2012 season: Third NCAA Tournament appearance.\nNagle's first season saw the graduation of 11 seniors, including Kevin Crowley, the first-overall draft pick in the 2011 NLL Draft. The inexperience showed early on as Stony Brook began the season 0–3, including a loss to #1 Virginia. The Seawolves won their first game of the season at #18 Delaware, a 7–6 nailbiter on the road and their first win over a ranked opponent since 2010. The season continued to spiral downward as Stony Brook would embark on a four-game losing streak, suffering home defeats to St. John's and Towson and road stumbles at Siena and Bryant (in 2OT).\nAt 1–7, the Seawolves' season looked bleak, but they won the first three conference matchups to build momentum before falling to #20 Yale and Hartford, both one-goal losses in overtime at home. Stony Brook defeated Albany in the regular season finale to head into the America East Tournament at 5–9. Stony Brook squeaked past Hartford in the semifinals and trounced Albany in the championship game to clinch the team's third NCAA Tournament berth and second in the last three years, doing so in Nagle's first year as head coach. Nagle won America East Coach of the Year honors for his inaugural performance.\nIn the First Round of the 2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship, Stony Brook lost 19–9 to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore to end the season at 7–10.\n2013–2019: The drought years.\nIn the years following the 2012 NCAA Tournament run, the Nagle-led Seawolves languished in mediocrity. Stony Brook played a tough schedule in 2013, with losses to #6 Virginia, #1 Maryland, and #12 Yale, but suffered a losing record in conference play for the first time since 2007 as the Seawolves lost two games in overtime. Their season ended with a 7–9 record after a loss to #12 Albany, 17–15, in the semifinals of the America East Tournament.\nIn 2014, Stony Brook had a second consecutive losing record in both overall and conference play. Stony Brook traveled to #1 Duke in a 14–6 loss, and played host to #1 Maryland in a 11–8 defeat. Stony Brook went 2–3 in conference play for a second year in a row. In the semifinals of the America East Tournament, the Seawolves lost 17–16 to #18 Albany, ending their season at 6–10 overall.\nThe 2015 season initially appeared to be a bounceback year for Stony Brook, who saw winning streaks of both four and five games, winning nine games in a ten-game span. The Seawolves' lone loss during that stretch was a home defeat to #15 Albany, but the team also beat #12 Princeton. Stony Brook's 10–2 start was a new program best, but back-to-back home losses against Lehigh, 12–11, and #6 Duke, 17–11, halted momentum after the five-game winning streak. Stony Brook then won the final three games of the regular season, with two overtime wins, to head into the America East Tournament at 12–4. The Seawolves beat Vermont 16–13 in the semifinals before being crushed by #6 Albany in the championship game, 22–9. Stony Brook tied the program record for wins in a season, ending 13–5, but missed the NCAA Tournament for a third straight year.\nStony Brook started 2016 strong at 5–1, with home wins over #16 Rutgers and #12 Hofstra and a loss to #9 Brown. The team's lone loss in America East play was to #11 Albany for the second straight season. Stony Brook won seven of its last eight regular season games to reach a 12–3 record. However, the Seawolves lost to Vermont 10–9 in the conference semifinals. In 2017, Stony Brook started 4–0, including a win at #10 Brown, before losing five of the next six. In a familiar scene, #6 Albany routed Stony Brook 19–6 in the America East semifinals to cap off a 7–7 campaign.\nStony Brook began the 2018 season 0–4. On March 10, Stony Brook hosted #9 Virginia, but the 15–14 loss was more memorable for the on-field fight that occurred. The Seawolves closed the season out strong, capturing a share of the America East regular season title for the first time since 2012. Nevertheless, Stony Brook lost in the semifinals of the America East Tournament for a third straight year.\nIn 2019, the Seawolves struggled initially, losing to #4 Penn State, Marist, Sacred Heart, and Hartford to bring their record to 3–4. However, they upset St. John's on the road, and came back from a 7–1 deficit to beat Vermont 10–9. Stony Brook clinched the regular season title by defeating Albany 12–10 at home in a rain-delayed season finale. Hosting the America East Tournament as the No. 1 seed, Stony Brook was upset at home 14–8 by UMBC in the semifinals, marking the team's fourth semifinal loss in a row. On May 14, Stony Brook athletic director Shawn Heilbron announced that Nagle would not return as head coach. In eight seasons with the Seawolves, Nagle recorded a 68–61 record overall and 31–14 in conference play, but made just one NCAA Tournament in his first season and had six one-and-dones in the America East Tournament.\nAnthony Gilardi takes over (2020–present).\nOn June 20, Stony Brook named Towson associate head coach and offensive coordinator Anthony Gilardi as the team's new head coach. Stony Brook began the season 5–1, with three overtime victories, all of which saw Caleb Pearson score the game-winning goal.\nIn 2022, Stony Brook won the inaugural Long Island Cup by beating LIU 10–6 in the championship.\nFacilities.\nThe Stony Brook Seawolves presently play their home games in Kenneth P.

        "text": "The Hungarian Tennis Championships (in Hungarian:\"Nemzeti Teniszbajnokság\", \"Magyar Országos Teniszbajnokság\" or abbreviated to \"tenisz ob\") also known as the Hungarian National Championships or the Hungarian Closed Championships is a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It is currently part of the official Tennis Calendar of Hungary of the Hungarian Tennis Association and is a gentlemen's and ladies' event.\nHistory.\nIt is the fourth oldest tennis tournament of the world, which is held annually since its establishment. The first championships entitled as the Hungary's Lawn Tennis Championships were arranged on June 16, 1894, in Balatonfüred by the Stefánia Yacht Club. It was a coeducated tournament thus the first \"men\"'s singles trophy was awarded to Austrian countess Paulina von Pálffy. The next year the women's roster was distinguished and the men's, women's doubles and in 1909 the mixed doubles were added. In 1899 the tournament moved to Budapest and was organized by the Budapest Lawn Tennis Club. In 1903 the first unofficial international competition was held and subsequently became a standalone championship. In 1907 the Hungarian Lawn Tennis Association was formed as a subsidiary of the Hungarian Athletics Club thus the latter's name was included as the Annual HAC Tennis Championships (later the governing body was shortened to Hungarian Tennis Association). The hard court came into use when the National Indoors Championships were distinguished in 1927 (\"fedett pályás ob\"). The same year red clay was introduced as a new surface beside the already existing grass courts. Traditionally the winner of the outdoors championships is considered the Hungarian (National) champion. In the beginning the tournament accepted foreign entries but after 1924 the Hungarian International Championships served as a diverse event while only Hungarian players could possibly go for the national title. After World War II the international branch went defunct and only the nationals were held. Thus this tournament did and does not qualify as an open on ATP standards and no points are awarded for the results. The location of the event is determined each year, which allows several clubs and cities to host it outside the capital Budapest including Pécs, Szeged and Hódmezővásárhely. The date also varies to fit the schedule of other events but to be suitable for open air playing thus it takes place between May and end of September.\nStatistics.\nHungarian Champions"

        "text": "John David Moffitt (born October 28, 1986) is a former American football offensive guard who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Wisconsin. Moffitt also played for the Denver Broncos and Philadelphia Eagles.\nHigh school career.\nMoffitt attended Notre Dame High School in West Haven, Connecticut, US, where he was a two-time all-conference choice as a two-way lineman. As a senior, he made 65 tackles and registered seven QB sacks in 2005. Regarded as a three-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", he was listed as the No. 13 prospect from the New England region.\nCollege career.\nMoffitt was a 2010 All-American selection by Associated Press, CBSSports.com, and Rivals.com at the University of Wisconsin.\nWhile some have heralded John's ability to run block, many red flags have been raised about his pass blocking skills. According to sidelinescouting.com, Moffitt is \"not very fast\" and \"lacks real quickness\", raising questions about his longevity as an American football guard or center.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nMoffitt was drafted number 75 overall by the Seattle Seahawks in the 2011 NFL Draft. Moffitt started nine games in the 2011 season before being injured in the week-13 game against the Baltimore Ravens. His career took a further downside when hit with a four-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs \nMoffitt was traded to the Cleveland Browns on August 19, 2013. On August 20, 2013, the trade was rescinded, reportedly due to Moffitt failing his physical. In an interview with 710 ESPN Seattle, Moffitt claimed that Cleveland wanted him to take less money to play there and when he said he wouldn't do that they told him that they were going to fail his physical.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn August 20, 2013, Moffitt was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for defensive tackle Sealver Siliga. Moffitt retired from the NFL on November 5, 2013. He stated that he was unhappy, and did not want to risk his health for money. He was not on the roster when the Broncos made the Super Bowl, the game in which they lost to his former team, the Seahawks. Moffitt said during his retirement that he didn't care about the upcoming Super Bowl anyway.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nMoffitt signed a one-year deal with the Eagles on June 29, 2015. He was cut by the Eagles on September 4, 2015.\nPersonal life.\nDuring his time with the Seahawks, Moffitt had several run-ins at Bellevue Square, Lincoln Square and the Eastside’s other Kemper Properties, from which Moffitt was banned in early 2012. After the ban, he was arrested on June 14, 2012, for allegedly urinating on a parked car near Bellevue Square mall, and was caught trespassing again that August at Lincoln Square’s Paddy Coyne’s bar. Moffitt was also charged with drug possession and battery in 2014."

        "title": "Amateur status in first-class cricket",
        "text": "Amateur status had a special meaning in English cricket. The amateur in this context was not merely someone who played cricket in his spare time but a particular type of first-class cricketer who existed officially until 1962, when the distinction between amateurs and professionals was abolished and all first-class players became nominally professional.\nDistinctions between amateur and professional status.\nOn the face of it, the distinctions between amateurs and professionals in first-class cricket were their availability and their means of remuneration. The professional cricketer received a wage from his county club or, if he went on a tour, a contracted fee paid by the tour organiser. In both cases, there was the possibility of bonuses being earned. The amateur \"in theory\" received expenses only, again paid either by his county club or a tour organiser. Professionals were full-time players during the cricket season and would mostly seek alternative employment in the winter months. The amateur was not always a full-time player during the season and many played by choice as they typically had other means of income or support. Some amateurs, those in education being a common example, were part-time players of necessity as they could only commit to cricket during the school or university holidays (say, late July to mid-September). Those in other forms of employment relied for availability on occasional holidays or, in some cases, being given time off by their employers. There were employers who hired well-known cricketers for commercial prestige reasons and so were keen to see them take part in big matches.\nIn terms of cause and effect, however, availability and remuneration were effects only. The real distinction between amateur and professional, encapsulated by the Gentlemen v Players fixture which was first arranged by Lord Frederick Beauclerk in 1806 and played annually from 1829 to 1962, was social status within the English class structure. Amateurs (the Gentlemen) belonged to the upper and middle classes; professionals (the Players) invariably came from the working class. It was perceived that the amateur held a higher station in life and was therefore a class apart from the professional. The outlook of the two classes contrasted in that most of the amateurs played primarily for enjoyment, while most of the professionals took the game, as their living, very seriously indeed. Of underlying importance to the concept of amateurism were the schools, universities and other centres of education in which cricket was played, both as a curricular and extracurricular activity. The public schools (e.g., Eton, Harrow, Winchester) and the main universities (i.e., Oxford and Cambridge) produced most of the first-class amateur players and standards of amateur cricket rose during the 19th century through rivalry between the schools and then at university.\nAs early as the 17th century, there is evidence that sporting types among the well-to-do relished strong competition and welcomed the opportunity to play against the best performers, who tended to be working class and in time became the first professionals. Although the gentry were happy to play with and against the working class, they still retained a sense of social distinction and so, by the 19th century, the word \"amateur\" had taken on a peculiar meaning of its own in cricket terms that was redolent of social status and implied respectability. The amateurs insisted upon separate dressing rooms and, at some grounds, even a separate gateway onto the field. On scorecards, the amateur would be listed initials first and a professional teammate initials last: for example, P. B. H. May and Laker, J. C. In one notably laughable instance, when the professional Fred Titmus was walking out to bat, the public announcer stated that there was a mistake in the printed scorecards being sold at the ground: \"F. J. Titmus should read Titmus, F. J.\"\nThe \"Gentlemen and Players\" distinction was a reflection of the higher status enjoyed by officers above other ranks in the British Army, and of employers above the workforce in commerce and industry. It therefore seemed natural to most 19th century English people, of all classes, to have a similar distinction in sport. This perception of amateurs as officers and gentlemen, and thereby leaders, meant that any team including an amateur would tend to appoint him as captain, even though most if not all of the professional players were more skilled technically. On occasion, as in the Yorkshire team of the 1920s, a ridiculous situation arose wherein the \"de facto\" captain was the senior professional (e.g., Wilfred Rhodes) and the nominal amateur captain \"did what he was told\". The idea of amateur captains only was applied to Test cricket from 1888. Some English touring teams to Australia until then had been all-professional, having been launched as private ventures, but England did not appoint another professional captain until Len Hutton in 1952 though, in the 1930s, Wally Hammond switched status from professional to amateur so that he could captain his country. Some of the amateur captains (e.g., W. G. Grace, Stanley Jackson, C. B. Fry and Peter May) were unquestionably worth their places in the England team on the grounds of their technical ability.\nBeginnings of amateurism (17th century).\nThe earliest definite mention of cricket is in a court case on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date) in which John Derrick, a Queen's Coroner for the county of Surrey, and therefore a gentleman, bore written testimony as to a parcel of land in Guildford. Derrick, then aged 59, stated that when he was a schoolboy he and his friends had played cricket on the land (i.e., c.1550). Records from the early years of the 17th century show that cricket, having apparently been a children's game, was increasingly taken up by adults and the first clear indication that the gentry were involved (notwithstanding Derrick's own status) is in the record of an ecclesiastical court held in 1629. In this, Henry Cuffin, a curate at Ruckinge in Kent, was prosecuted by an Archdeacon's Court for playing cricket on a Sunday evening after prayers. He claimed that several of his fellow players were \"persons of repute and fashion\". For the next two centuries, the gentry saw cricket as a gambling sport akin to prizefighting and horse racing. The earliest mention of cricket-related gambling is in a 1646 court case that concerned non-payment of a wager. In 1652, another court case accused a gentleman called John Rabson, Esq. and other defendants who were all working class, revealing that cricket had crossed the social divide.\nFrom the start of the English Civil War, the Long Parliament (1642–60) banned theatres and other social activities that met with Puritan disapproval, but there is no actual evidence of cricket being prohibited, except as previously that it was not allowed on Sundays. For example, three men were prosecuted at Eltham in Kent for playing cricket on a Sunday in 1654. Oliver Cromwell had established the Protectorate the previous year, so the Puritans were fully in control, but the defendants were charged with \"breaking the Sabbath\", not with playing cricket. It is believed that Cromwell himself was an early gentleman participant, having played both cricket and football as a young man.\nIt was during the second half of the 17th century that, in Roy Webber's words, \"the game took a real grip\" especially in the south-eastern counties. The nobility withdrew to their country estates during the Commonwealth and were involved in village cricket as a pastime which, after the Commonwealth expired in 1660, they continued to indulge when they returned to London. The Restoration was effectively completed during the spring of 1660 and one of its immediate results was an increase in gambling, mostly by the gentry, on cricket and other sports. In Harry Altham's view, the same period \"was really the critical stage in the game's evolution\" with a kind of \"feudal patronage\" being established as the nobility took control of the sport, their interest fuelled by the opportunities for gambling that it provided, and this set the pattern for cricket's development through the 18th century. The post-Restoration period saw the first \"great matches\" as cricket evolved into a major sport, a significant aspect of the evolution being the introduction of professionalism. Members of the nobility and gentry who returned to London after the Restoration were keen to develop cricket and brought with them some of the \"local experts\" from village cricket whom they now employed as professional players. Altham wrote that within a year or two of the Restoration, \"it became the thing in London society to make matches and form clubs\".\nIn 1694, accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at Lewes. The earliest known newspaper report of a first-class match was in the \"Foreign Post\" dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:\n\"The middle of last week a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece\".\nThe high stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven-a-side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled. No other details were given but the report provides real evidence to support the view that \"great matches\" played for high stakes were in vogue in the years following the Restoration. One of the main cricket patrons at the time was Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, resident at Goodwood House in Sussex.\nAs the 17th century ended, cricket in the words of David Underdown was \"embedded in the culture of many English social groups\" – the aristocracy, the merchant class, the working class and even \"the delinquents\". The aristocracy was the group that advanced the cause of amateurism and did so, in several fields of activity, with the purpose of publicly asserting their political and social authority to emphasise, as Underdown said, \"what they fondly believed was the popular nature of their rule\". Their strategy was to portray themselves as regional and national leaders who nevertheless shared the habits and assumptions of their neighbours, and one of those habits was taking an active part in sport – not only by playing but in the main through conspicuous patronage. The willingness of aristocrats to mix with the working class on the cricket field may have helped to promote social stability; the historian G. M. Trevelyan wrote (admittedly concerning a period about a hundred years later): \"If the French noblesse had been capable of playing cricket with their peasants, their chateaux would never have been burnt\".\n18th century.\nPatronage was of vital importance to the growth and development of cricket in the 18th century. It is extremely doubtful if cricket would ever have become a national sport without patronage and gambling. The key figures in the 18th century were the Dukes of Richmond; Edwin Stead; Sir William Gage; Frederick, Prince of Wales; Lord John Sackville; John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset; Sir Horatio Mann; George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and, into the 19th century, Lord Frederick Beauclerk. They were all members of the nobility or the gentry, they all played cricket (Beauclerk and, to a lesser degree, Dorset were very good players) and they all gambled on matches.\nTo boost their chances of winning wagers, some patrons formed their own county-class teams such as the Kent and Sussex teams led by Stead and the 2nd Duke of Richmond in the 1720s. As players themselves, they captained their teams and it was gentlemen like them, and the friends whom they invited to play, who established cricket's amateur tradition. Professionals were paid a match fee for taking part. Thus, a Sussex team of the 1720s might be captained by Richmond and include not only additional gentlemen like his fellow patron Gage but also professionals like Thomas Waymark. That was the pattern of first-class English teams until 1962. Waymark, for example, was employed by the Duke of Richmond as a groom and this became a common arrangement between patron and professional in the 18th century. In later years, Lumpy Stevens and John Minshull were employed by their patrons as a gardener and gamekeeper respectively. In the longer term, however, the professional became an employee of his club and the beginnings of this trend could be observed in the 1770s when the Hambledon Club paid match fees to its players.\nWhile the gentlemen were happy to play in the same team as the professionals, a form of apartheid was created off the field (e.g., separate changing rooms and gateways as mentioned above). Conscious of their higher social status, they used the fact that they were not paid a match fee to declare themselves amateurs, though not in the sense of someone playing the game as a spare-time hobby because they were either investing in each game by wagering or by claiming expenses for travel and accommodation. They styled themselves amateurs in order to erect a barrier between themselves and the working class professionals. The concept was a reflection not only of social status but also of the military mindset which perceived three separate classes: officers, sergeants and the so-called \"other ranks\". That classification was even extended to marriage in terms of \"officers and their ladies, sergeants and their wives, other ranks and their women\".\nAssertion of authority was always an amateur trait and in no way was this more emphatically asserted than in the taking of full responsibility for drafting and agreeing, among themselves only, the Laws of cricket. The sport had rules from time immemorial but, as with football, subject to local variations. William Goldwin's 1706 poem \"In Certamen Pilae\" (On a Ball Game), which describes a rural cricket match, has a scene in which the teams dispute the rules of the match, each insisting on their own code of laws. Arbitration falls to a character called Nestor, clearly based on the Homeric ruler, who imposes his \"Justas Leges\", acceptable to both teams. The context is uncertain but the phrase can be taken to mean an \"established code\". Goldwin, incidentally, was a scholar of both Eton and Cambridge.\nIn 1727, ahead of two games to be patronised by them, the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton, drew up Articles of Agreement to determine the terms and conditions applicable to their matches. This document, which has been preserved, is cricket's oldest set of written rules. Many of the rules are concerned with pitch dimensions, means of dismissal, scoring runs, etc. but there are some striking points which emphasised the authority of the patrons. For example, the Duke and Mr Brodrick selected an umpire each, as well as all the players, and only they were allowed to address the umpires. In 1744 and again in 1774, the first versions of what are now known as \"The Laws of Cricket\" were coded by the \"Noblemen and Gentlemen\" who, in 1744, frequented the Artillery Ground in London. By 1774, they were associated in cricketing terms with the Hambledon Club and, in London, with a convivial club called the \"Je-ne-sais-quoi\" which met at an establishment called the \"Star and Garter\" on Pall Mall.\nThe original Lord's ground was opened in May 1787 and was intended to be the private preserve of the same gentlemen's club, which from 1782 had become known as the White Conduit Club, based in Islington, and would soon reconstitute itself as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Only a gentleman could become a member but the club from its very beginning employed or contracted professionals. Thomas Lord himself was a professional bowler at the White Conduit who was given the job of finding the ground that was afterwards named after him. Lord's immediately began to stage first-class matches and these attracted the crowds that some members had originally sought to avoid. MCC teams soon adopted the now age-old formula of \"gentlemen\" and \"players\" in the same team. Very early in its history, MCC claimed ownership of the Laws and re-published them on 30 May 1788. In the 21st century, MCC still retains copyright of the Laws although it is now the International Cricket Conference (ICC) which has power of regulation.\nThe \"noblemen and gentlemen\" may have had the final word in cricket's governance during the 18th century but the professionals certainly had a voice, as illustrated by two famous incidents. In September 1771, when Chertsey played Hambledon at Laleham Burway, Chertsey's Thomas White introduced a bat that was fully as wide as the wicket. He was not actually cheating because there was no limit on bat size at the time, rather he was probably making a point in order to force an issue because straight bats were still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, and it is believed that there was no standard. The Hambledon professionals objected and their senior bowler Thomas Brett wrote out a formal protest that was signed by himself, his captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman John Small, all three being professional players. Brett's action brought about a change in the Laws, as confirmed in 1774, whereby the maximum width of the bat was set at four and one quarter inches. This ruling remains intact. In May 1775, master batsman Small was involved in the incident which resulted in the introduction of the third (middle) stump in the wicket. The wicket in 1775 still consisted of two uprights and a crosspiece, as it had from time immemorial. In a single wicket match played at the Artillery Ground, the great Chertsey bowler Lumpy Stevens (another professional) beat Small at least three times only for the ball to pass \"through\" the wicket without disturbing it, and Small won the match for Hambledon. Like Brett before him, Stevens protested and his petition was granted soon afterwards, although research has discovered that the introduction of the third stump in practice was gradual and the two-stump wicket did continue in places for a number of years yet.\nGentlemen v Players.\nLord Frederick Beauclerk was the leading \"amateur\" player of the Napoleonic period but he was notoriously mercenary, despite his status and his calling as an ordained minister of religion. In 1806, he had the idea of a match between the amateurs and the professionals. To emphasise the social distance between the two, the amateur team would be called the Gentlemen and the paid professionals the Players. Even then, it was not a straight match because Beauclerk selected the two leading professional players Billy Beldham and William Lambert as given men for the Gentlemen. Thanks mainly to Lambert's contribution, the Gentlemen won. The match was not a success but Beauclerk organised a repeat two weeks later, also at Lord's. This time, only Lambert was given, while Beldham joined the Players. The joint efforts of Beauclerk and Lambert earned another win for the Gentlemen. The seed for the long-running series had been planted but the fixture was not revived until 1819. Cricket was badly disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, especially between 1810 and 1814. The 1819 match was won by the Players, who had the unquestionably amateur Lord Strathavon as a \"given man\", against a Gentlemen team that was all-amateur and included their best players Beauclerk, E. H. Budd and William Ward. As in 1806, the game attracted little interest but MCC were determined to persevere.\nIn 1821, the so-called \"Coronation Match\" could have killed the fixture. The Gentlemen were all out for 60 and then the Players steadily amassed 270–6, a large score given pitch conditions at the time, with Thomas Beagley scoring 113*, the first century in the series. Sometime during the second day, the Gentlemen got fed up of fielding and conceded defeat. Derek Birley remarked that it was called the \"Coronation Match\" to celebrate the accession of the unpopular George IV \"and it was a suitably murky affair\".\nThe fixture survived and managed to struggle through the 1820s and 1830s, when it was necessary to handicap the Players to give the Gentlemen a competitive chance. It became annual (often played more than once per season) from 1829. The teams were evenly matched in the early 1840s when Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix were in the Gentlemen team but then, of the 25 matches from July 1844 to July 1865, the Players won 23 with one draw and only one win for the Gentlemen.\nIn 1865, W. G. Grace came into the Gentlemen team and the picture changed completely with the Gentlemen dominant for the next twenty years. From the mid-1880s, the batsmen on each side were usually strong but the hallmark of the Players from that time became their greater strength in bowling and fielding, areas in which the Gentlemen were relatively weak after Grace was past his best.\nThe teams remained evenly matched until the end of the 19th century but in the 130 encounters between 1900 and 1962, the Gentlemen won only 15, with the Players winning 57 and 58 being drawn.\nThe Gentlemen's last victory, at Scarborough in September 1953, was achieved after the Players had scored 532–5 declared (Len Hutton 241) in their first innings. The Gentlemen, captained by Hutton's Yorkshire colleague Norman Yardley, replied with 447–8 declared (Peter May 157). Hutton sportingly declared the Players' second innings at 165–6 to give the Gentlemen a feasible target of 251 in the final sessions. Thanks to an innings of 133 by Bill Edrich, they won by 5 wickets.\nMeanwhile, social change after the Second World War was leading inexorably to a reaction against the concept of amateurism in English cricket and, on 31 January 1963, all first-class cricketers became nominally professional as, in effect, \"Players\".\nThe last edition of the Gentlemen v Players fixture was played 8, 10 and 11 September 1962 at Scarborough. The Players, under the captaincy of Fred Trueman, won by 7 wickets. The Gentlemen scored 328 and 217; the Players replied with 337 and 212–3. Ken Barrington, with exactly 100, scored the last century in the series.\n19th century.\nIn 1801, an antiquarian book about English sport noted that cricket had become \"exceedingly fashionable, being much countenanced by the nobility and gentlemen of fortune\". In another work a year later, the fashion for cricket was deplored because it was (and remains) a dangerous activity, the writer saying that the country expects very different from those of \"rank and fortune\" than from those of \"the labouring classes\". The determining factor in cricket's future as an \"exceedingly fashionable\" sport was its popularity, handed down through generations from old boys to new boys, in the fee-paying (\"public\") schools. Even so, headmasters of the time were not convinced that inter-school rivalry was a good thing and, when Eton played Harrow at Lord's in 1805, the match was organised by the boys themselves, among them Lord Byron.\nLike everything else, cricket struggled as the Napoleonic Wars wore on and very few matches were played when the conflict escalated from 1810 to 1814. MCC were accused by some critics of not providing leadership or vision but in fact MCC kept the game alive and maintained a profile. There was a discernible change in the type of membership as the war progressed. As the 1820s began, the aristocrats like Dorset, Winchilsea and Colonel Lennox had gone and MCC's leading lights then, besides Beauclerk, included E. H. Budd, a civil servant, and William Ward, a banker. Having been founded by \"noblemen and gentlemen\", MCC now belonged to the \"gentlemen\" and, as such, they were keen to maintain their \"declaration of social realities\" by matching teams of Gentlemen against teams of paid Players.\nFrom the 1820s to the 1860s, the influence and status of amateurism steadily rose to a zenith that Derek Birley called the \"Amateur Ambuscade\" and Harry Altham called the \"Halcyon Days of Amateur Cricket\". Standards of play at the fee-paying schools and at the two great universities rose to an unprecedented height that remains unsurpassed. Having said that, credit for the prolonged success of the Gentlemen against the Players through the 1870s belongs essentially to W. G. Grace, who became an amateur by special MCC invitation. None of the Grace brothers attended public school or university; they learned how to play at home and in local club cricket. This period of amateur dominance, encompassing as it did the so-called Golden Age of cricket, lasted until an erosion set in after the First World War which ultimately resulted in the abolition of amateurism in 1962.\nGentlemen v Players became the most famous match of the 19th century, albeit challenged by North v South and by the annual matches between the All-England Eleven (the AEE) and the United All-England Eleven (the UEE), until international cricket and the official County Championship began. In amateur circles, it was one of three main events of the cricket season. The others were The University Match between Oxford and Cambridge, which was first played in 1827; and until 1854 the Schools Week at Lord's, involving the teams of Eton, Harrow and Winchester. Cricket was played at the schools and universities in the 18th century but it was never really noteworthy until the Eton v Harrow match of 1805 although, like Gentlemen v Players, that match was followed by a hiatus until it was revived and became established, a few exceptions aside, as an annual fixture at Lord's. The first University Match was played at Lord's in 1827 and it became an annual fixture from 1838, again played mostly at Lord's. There was no inter-county cricket through the Napoleonic Wars and it was not revived until 1825 when Sussex played four matches, two each against Hampshire and Kent. These county teams were still the largely \"ad hoc\" units of the 18th century, reliant on patronage. The first formally constituted county club was Sussex in 1839, followed in the 1840s by Cambridgeshire, Kent, Nottinghamshire and Surrey; in the 1860s by Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire; and then by Derbyshire and the Grace family's Gloucestershire in 1870.\nAbolition of amateurism.\nThe abolition of amateur status in 1962 was partly the result of long-established disillusionment with the hypocrisy known as \"shamateurism\". The amateur was, by definition, not a professional and in November 1878, the haughtily worded dictum of the amateur-dominated Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was:\n\"that no gentleman ought to make a profit by his service (\"sic\") in the cricket field\".\nThey also added an empty threat that anyone found guilty of profiteering would be barred from taking part in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's.\nIn practice, many leading amateurs were paid for playing, and it is widely believed that the most famous amateur cricketer, W. G. Grace, made more money out of cricket than any genuine professional. In Charles Williams' view, the dictum was very subtly worded because it did not forbid amateurs from making money from cricket \"off the field of play\". In fairness to Grace, he was a general practitioner who had to pay for a \"locum tenens\" to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket, and he had a reputation for treating poor and impoverished patients at a lowered or no fee. C. B. Fry commented that Grace was the only man who became a doctor of medicine \"on account of successful operations on the cricket field\".\nThe use of the term \"shamateurism\" apparently originated during the English tour of Australia in 1887–88, a venture from which certain amateurs, notably George Vernon, Andrew Stoddart and Walter Read, were known to be profiting. Long before that, the Grace brothers had been notorious for submitting excessive expense claims but, when an official enquiry was held into their activities in January 1879, the outcome was an official whitewash and they continued to profit. In the 20th century, there were cases of amateur players being given a nominal job, such as county club assistant secretary. Sometimes, there were allegations of surreptitiously paid bonuses over and above the \"bona fide\" travelling and hotel expenses that they were entitled to claim.\nAlthough concerns about shamateurism were widespread, the abolition of amateurism was actually the result of interaction by two irresistible forces: \nAn example of the latter is cricket authorities ending the Gentlemen v Players fixture after amateurism was abolished (and with it the \"raison d'etre\" for the fixture) on 31 January 1963, and introducing the Gillette Cup limited overs knockout competition (which was also the first sponsored cricket competition) in its place.\nThere were contrasting views about the end of amateurism and the passing of Gentlemen v Players. Some traditionalists like E. W. Swanton and the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" lamented the \"passing of an era\". On the other hand, social change had rendered the whole concept an anachronism, and Fred Trueman spoke for many when he described amateurism as a \"ludicrous business\" that was \"thankfully abolished\" and said he was glad there would be \"no more fancy caps\".\nCharles Williams commented that amateurism in the highest levels of cricket had become \"so ludicrous in its presentation and corrupt in its practice\" that its end was a necessity, but he praised other aspects of the concept – its so-called \"Corinthian spirit\" whereby a game was played with \"honour and verve\" – which he believed had value and the disappearance of which would in time be seen as a loss to society."

        "title": "Jake Matthews (American football)",
        "text": "Jacob Thomas Matthews (born February 11, 1992) is an American football offensive tackle for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Falcons sixth overall in the 2014 NFL draft. He played college football at Texas A&amp;M. He is a member of the Matthews family of football players.\nEarly years.\nMatthews attended Elkins High School in Missouri City, where he was a standout offensive lineman for the Elkins Knights high school football team. He was teammates with D. J. Hayden. In his senior season, Matthews was a first-team all-district and all-greater Houston honoree as his team finished the season with a 9–3 record. Matthews was invited to play in the 2010 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and also earned 2009 High School All-American honors by \"USA Today\", \"Parade\", and \"SuperPrep\".\nRegarded as a four-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", he was listed as the No. 7 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2010. He chose Texas A&amp;M over offers from Oklahoma, Alabama, Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Texas Tech, Southern California, and Stanford.\nCollege career.\nAs a junior in 2012, Matthews was a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection in recognition of his successful season. He also received first-team All-American honors by the Football Writers Association of America. During his senior season, Matthews played left tackle after playing right tackle for the previous three seasons.\nAs a senior in 2013, Matthews was again a first-team All-SEC selection.\nProfessional career.\nMatthews was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons with the sixth overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft. With Luke Joeckel having been selected second overall in the 2013 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, Texas A&amp;M became the first school with consecutive top-10 selected offensive lineman since USC's Tyron Smith and Matt Kalil in 2011 and 2012, respectively.\nIn his first NFL game, Matthews suffered a high ankle sprain in a season-opening win against the Saints. Despite the injury, Matthews started in all but one game in his rookie season. In 2015, Matthews' blocking improved, allowing only 38 quarterback pressures compared to 51 in 2014. That season, Matthews was named as the third most improved player of 2015 by Pro Football Focus.\nIn the 2016 season, Matthews and the Falcons reached Super Bowl LI, where they faced the New England Patriots. In the Super Bowl, Matthews played all offensive snaps, as the Falcons lost in overtime to the Patriots, 34–28, after giving up a 28–3 lead. In the second half, Matthews was flagged twice for offensive holding, and both of those penalties proved costly in the end, as they pushed the Falcons out of field goal range twice, despite already being in range, therefore erasing two opportunities for the Falcons to put the game away. \nOn April 25, 2017, the Falcons picked up the fifth-year option on Matthews' contract. He started all 16 games at left tackle for the third straight year for the Falcons in 2017.\nOn July 27, 2018, Matthews signed a five-year, $75 million contract extension with the Falcons.\nOn January 23, 2019, Matthews was named to his first Pro Bowl as a replacement for Redskins offensive tackle Trent Williams.\nDuring the 2020 season, Matthews played in all 16 games, allowing only three quarterback sacks, six quarterback hits, and three total penalties on 1,113 offensive snaps. For his 2020 performance, he earned a 75.5 overall Pro Football Focus grade, with a 84.0 grade in pass blocking and 57.4 grade in run blocking. His pass blocking ranked 9th among all tackles in the NFL and his run blocking ranked 47th. The 75.5 overall grade was the lowest he received since the 2016 season. Matthews has played at least 1,000 snaps every season since 2015.\nOn March 14, 2022, Matthews signed a three-year, $52.5 million extension with the Falcons. By the end of November 2022, Matthews started 138 consecutive regular season games, the longest active streak for a left tackle in the NFL.\nPersonal life.\nMatthews was born in Houston, Texas. He is the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Bruce Matthews and the younger brother of Kevin Matthews, a center who also played for the Aggies and last played for the Carolina Panthers in 2015. His younger brother, Mike, last played center for the Miami Dolphins. He is also the cousin of former linebacker Clay Matthews III, who spent the majority of his career playing for the Green Bay Packers, and Casey Matthews, a linebacker who last played for the Minnesota Vikings. He is the nephew of NFL veteran Clay Matthews Jr., the grandson of NFL veteran Clay Matthews Sr., and the great-grandson of H. L. Matthews. He is married to Meggi Matthews and they have one son, Beckett Matthews."

On October 15, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had a touchdown on a blocked punt. He earned his first career start in Week 17 in place of Gurley after the Rams decided to rest their starters in preparation for the playoffs. He rushed for 54 yards in the game and caught four passes for seven yards. Overall, he finished the 2017 season with 246 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, nine receptions, and 53 receiving yards.\nOn April 16, 2018, Brown signed his ERFA tender for 2018 season.

        "title": "List of 2002 Winter Olympics medal winners",
        "text": "The 2002 Winter Olympics, officially known by the International Olympic Committee as the \"XIX Olympic Winter Games\", was an international multi-sport event held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from 8 February through 24 February 2002. A total of 2399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in 78 events across 15 disciplines.\nNew events were contested in these Games; skeleton (introduced for the first time at the 1928 Winter Olympics and not contested since 1948) was re-introduced with events for both men and women, while women's bobsleigh was added to the program. The 78 events in Salt Lake City were an increase from 68 in Nagano at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Both men and women competed at these Games.\nA total of 407 athletes won at least one medal at the Games. Athletes from Norway topped the medal table with the most gold medals, winning 13 golds out of 25 total medals. Germany won the most medals overall with 36, of which 12 were gold. Host nation the United States won 34 medals, 10 of them gold. Athletes from 24 participating NOCs won at least one medal; and competitors from 18 won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Australia and China won their respective nations' first Winter Olympic gold medals, while the Croatian and Estonian delegations each won their first Winter Olympic medals of any color. Of the 407 medalists, 55 athletes won more than one medal of any color at the Games. Of the multiple medalists, 31 won at least one gold medal, and 13 won multiple gold medals.\nA judging scandal in the pairs figure skating event, where it was revealed that a French judge was had been bribed to inflate the scores of the Russian pair, led to the declaration of joint Olympic champions in the pairs event. Georg Hackl of Germany finished in second in the men's luge singles event, becoming the first athlete to win a medal at five consecutive Games in the same individual event. The United States teams, in the four-man bobsleigh event, won the country's first bobsleigh medals in 46 years. The 2002 Games also saw the first Winter Olympics gold medalists of African origin: Vonetta Flowers of the United States in the women's bobsleigh event, and Canada's Jarome Iginla in men's ice hockey. The Games saw improved doping testing conditions; four medalists (three from Russia and one from Spain) were stripped of their medals as a result of doping disqualifications. Ole Einar Bjørndalen was the Games' most decorated athlete, winning four gold medals; Janica Kostelić was the best-performing female athlete with three golds and a silver medal. Finnish athlete Samppa Lajunen became the first person to win three Nordic combined gold medals at a single Olympics, while Simon Ammann of Switzerland, who had not won a FIS Ski Jumping World Cup event before the Games, was the surprise performer, winning the gold medal on both the normal and large hills.\nMedal winner changes.\nA. Alain Baxter, representing Great Britain, originally placed third and was awarded the bronze medal. However, Baxter tested positive for methamphetamine, and was stripped of his medal. Baxter was later cleared of intentionally doping by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but the International Olympic Committee did not re-award his medal. Benjamin Raich was promoted to bronze.\nB. Johann Mühlegg of Spain originally won the 10 km/10 km pursuit, but nine days after the race he failed a doping test following his gold medal win in the 50 km classical race. In 2003, a CAS ruling against Mühlegg allowed the International Olympic Committee to strip him of his other medals. Norwegians Frode Estil and Thomas Alsgaard, who had originally tied in a dead heat for silver, were promoted to gold, while fourth-placed Per Elofsson was promoted to bronze.\nC. Mühlegg had also won gold in the 30 km mass start event, and lost it following the CAS ruling in December 2003. Christian Hoffmann, Mikhail Botvinov and Kristen Skjeldal were all promoted one position each into gold, silver and bronze respectively.\nD. Mühlegg won gold in the 50 km, but after the podium ceremony it emerged that he had failed a test for darbepoetin alfa, and was immediately stripped of his medal. Mikhail Ivanov, Andrus Veerpalu and Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset were elevated to gold, silver and bronze respectively.\nE. Russian skier Olga Danilova had finished the event in first, ahead of compatriot Larissa Lazutina and Canada's Beckie Scott. In June 2003, a Swiss court ruled that the IOC could rescind Lazutina's silver medal for a positive test for darbepoetin, promoting Scott to silver and Kateřina Neumannová to bronze. The CAS then ruled in December that Danilova's medal could also be rescinded for her failed darbepoetin test, leading to another change in the event standings. Scott and Neumannová were both promoted again, with Viola Bauer now getting the bronze.\nF. Lazutina's silver medal in the 15 km event was also forfeited in 2003 following the Swiss court's ruling. Neumannová was again a beneficiary, being promoted to silver, while Lazutina's teammate Yuliya Chepalova was promoted to bronze. She failed a drug test later in her career, but her results were left unaffected.\nG. Lazutina won gold in the 30 km classical race, but because of her failed doping test was stripped of the medal after the race. Gabriella Paruzzi was promoted to gold, Stefania Belmondo to silver and Bente Skari to bronze.\nH. Canada's Salé and Pelletier finished second based on the original judges' scores. However, following the revelation of a collusion between the Russian officials and a French judge, the original scores were thrown out and Salé and Pelletier were elevated to joint-gold with the Russian pair.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes who won at least two gold medals or three total medals are listed below by number of medals won, followed by number of gold, silver, and bronze."

He also qualified for the 2011 World Championship, again losing 0–3 in the first round to Simon Whitlock.\nAfter coming dangerously close to having to pack in the game due to the financial restraints of touring, Steve announced on 21 March 2012 that he has acquired a full sponsor to continue his PDC career. In April, he earned a place in the European Tour Event 1 in Vienna by defeating Ian Jopling and Jamie Lewis in the UK qualifier. He played Steve Brown in the first round and won 6–2, but then lost to Wes Newton 2–6 in round two. This later proved to be Evans' best result of 2012 and earned him £1,000. He also qualified for the second European Tour event, held in Berlin, with a win over John Henderson in the UK qualifier. He faced Brown again in the first round and this time lost 3–6. Evans has not competed in a PDC event since this defeat. After the 2013 PDC World Championship he was ranked world number 79, outside of the top 64 who retain their places on the PDC tour. He did not enter Q School and has therefore lost his PDC tour card for 2013. Evans was knocked out in the quarter-finals of the 2014's first Challenge Tour event 5–1 by Matthew Edgar. He did not play in an event in 2015 and only entered five in 2016.\nSteve quit the PDC in January 2020."

Then, after a nine-year break, it was classified as an \"official\" first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs.\nThe club's first match was played in 1864 against Sussex at the Antelope Ground. Led by George Ede, Hampshire lost by 10 wickets. Over the next 21 years, Hampshire played 74 first-class matches, although with little success. Following years of difficult circumstances and poor results to 1885, Hampshire is not rated a first-class team between 1886 and 1894.\nPlayers are listed in order of appearance, where players made their debut in the same match, they are ordered by batting order."

        "title": "2011–12 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2011 season began on January 7, 2012. The postseason tournament concluded with the New York Giants defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, 21–17, on February 5, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.\nThe Houston Texans qualified the playoffs for the first time since entering the league in 2002, and the Detroit Lions qualified for the first time since 1999. The Buffalo Bills, who were eliminated from playoff contention for the twelfth straight year then, were the only team that had not made the playoffs in the 21st century (and would not do so again until 2017). This team was tied with the Lions for the overall longest failure streak entering the season (the Bills had also not made the playoffs since qualifying as a wild card in 1999 where they were defeated by the Tennessee Titans).\nThis was the first postseason since 2001–02 to not feature Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\nBoth the conferences’ runners-up made the Super Bowl the next year, which Baltimore won, 34–31.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern Standard Time ()\"\nOvertime rules.\nThis was the second postseason that the modified playoff overtime rules were in effect. Under these rules, instead of a straight sudden death, the game will not immediately end if the team that wins the coin toss scores a field goal on its first possession (the game will end if a touchdown is scored by the offense or if the defense scores a safety on the first possession of the overtime period). Instead, the other team will get a possession. If the loser of the coin toss scores a touchdown on that possession, it will be declared the winner. If the winner of the coin toss does not score on its first possession, or if both teams score field goals on their first possession, the game will revert to sudden death.\nNone of the games during the 2010–11 NFL playoffs went into overtime. The first overtime game that used these new rules was this postseason's Wild Card playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Broncos won the coin toss and received. They proceeded to win the game 29–23 by scoring a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage, immediately ending the game.\nCoincidentally, the same two teams had also played in the NFL's first regular season overtime game at Denver's Mile High Stadium on September 22, 1974, which resulted in a 35–35 tie.\nAfter the season, this \"modified sudden death\" overtime system was applied to all preseason and regular season games.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games and Super Bowl XLVI. CBS telecast the rest of the AFC playoff games and Fox the rest of the NFC games.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 7, 2012.\nAFC: Houston Texans 31, Cincinnati Bengals 10.\nIn the first playoff game in Reliant Stadium (and the first NFL playoff game played in Houston since 1993), Houston's defense forced four sacks and intercepted three passes, while their offense racked up 188 rushing yards en route to the team's first playoff win since the team's founding in 2002. For the Bengals, it marked their fourth consecutive playoff loss since 1990 and extended their playoff win drought to 21 years, the longest streak among all NFL teams.\nIn the first quarter, a 52-yard pass interference penalty against Texans cornerback Glover Quin while trying to cover A. J. Green gave the Bengals a first down at the Houston 24-yard line. Then facing third down and seven, backup tailback Brian Leonard ran a screen pass 16 yards to the 1-yard line, where Cedric Benson ran the ball into the end zone on the next play, giving Cincinnati a 7–0 lead. Houston struck back with a 6-play, 80-yard scoring drive. The key player on the drive was running back Arian Foster, who rushed five times for 44 yards, the last carry an 8-yard touchdown run to tie the game.\nIn the second quarter, Cincinnati drove to the Texans 23-yard line. But on third down, quarterback Andy Dalton was sacked for a 9-yard loss by linebacker Brooks Reed, and then Mike Nugent missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. On the Bengals next drive, Dalton's 36-yard completion to reserve tight end Donald Lee and a 15-yard penalty against Houston at the end of the play set up Nugent's 37-yard field goal to make the score 10–7. Houston countered with T. J. Yates completing four passes for 38 yards on a 59-yard drive that ended with Neil Rackers' 39-yard field goal. Then with just 52 seconds left in the half, rookie defensive end J. J. Watt intercepted a pass from Dalton at the line of scrimmage and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown to give the Texans a 17–10 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, Houston completely took over the game. After the first three drives ended in punts, Yates completed two passes to Foster for 27 yards before tossing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Andre Johnson. On the Bengals next possession, they moved the ball to the Texans 47-yard line. But on fourth down and 3, Dalton's pass was intercepted by former Bengal Johnathan Joseph. Then in the fourth quarter, Houston put the game completely out of reach with an interception by Danieal Manning that set up Foster's 42-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 31–10 with just over five minutes left in regulation.\nFoster finished the game with 153 rushing yards, three receptions for 29 yards, and two touchdowns. He became the third undrafted player in NFL history ever to rush for over 100 yards in a playoff game, after Paul Lowe and Ryan Grant.\nThe attendance of 71,725 was a record crowd for a football game at Reliant Stadium; in 2009, WrestleMania 25 was attended by 72,744 fans. The Bengals extended their current playoff losing streak to four, dating back to the divisional round loss against the Los Angeles Raiders in January 1991. This was the first game in playoff history ever to feature a starting rookie quarterback for each team.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 45, Detroit Lions 28.\nNew Orleans never punted the ball, gained a postseason record 626 yards, converted three fourth downs, and scored 35 points in the second half to defeat the Lions, who were playing their first playoff game in twelve years.\nDetroit quarterback Matthew Stafford completed five of six passes for 70 yards on the opening drive of the game, the last one a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Will Heller. Later on, a 31-yard burst by Saints running back Pierre Thomas set up Darren Sproles' 2-yard touchdown run, tying the score early in the second quarter.\nDetroit responded on their next drive, moving the ball 87 yards in nine plays and taking a 14–7 lead on Stafford's 13-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Johnson. With 21 seconds left in the half, New Orleans appeared to score the tying touchdown on a pass from Drew Brees to receiver Marques Colston, but the catch was overturned by official review, and the Saints ended up settling for a John Kasay field goal to cut the score to 14–10 at the end of the half.\nThe Saints dominated the second half, scoring touchdowns on five consecutive possessions before ending the game on their sixth. On the first play of the third quarter, Thomas rushed for 18 yards. Running back Chris Ivory then added a 19-yard run before Brees finished the drive with a 41-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson. Then after a Lions punt, New Orleans drove 92 yards, featuring a 40-yard completion from Brees to Henderson, and scored with his 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jimmy Graham.\nThis time Detroit stormed back, with Stafford completing two passes to Johnson for 63 yards before rushing the ball into the end zone himself on a 1-yard run, making the score 24–21. But their defense still could not stop Brees, who completed five passes for 52 yards on a 78-yard drive that ended with Sproles' second touchdown on a 17-yard run. Then on the first play of the Lions' next drive, Jabari Greer intercepted Stafford's pass at the New Orleans 39-yard line. Four plays later, Brees converted the turnover with a 56-yard touchdown pass to Robert Meachem. This time, Detroit managed to respond, with Johnson catching three passes for 38 yards on a 79-yard drive, the last one a 12-yard score. But New Orleans recovered Jason Hanson's onside kick attempt and stormed back for another touchdown, with Meachem's 41-yard reception setting up Thomas' 1-yard scoring run. Then the Saints sealed the victory with Greer's second interception from Stafford, enabling them to run out the rest of the clock.\nBrees completed 33 of 43 passes for a franchise postseason record 466 yards and three touchdowns. Meachem and Colston both recorded over 100 receiving yards each, while Thomas and Sproles combined for 264 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns between them.\nStafford threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions, while Johnson set franchise playoff records with 12 receptions for 211 yards and two scores.\nWith the victory the Saints ran their home playoff winning streak to five dating back to their 2000 victory over the St. Louis Rams, which was also the first playoff win in their history. The Lions continued their streak of playoff futility, having only one playoff win – their divisional playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys in January 1992 – in their history since the AFL–NFL merger. This streak ended in 2023.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Lions and Saints.\nSunday, January 8, 2012.\nNFC: New York Giants 24, Atlanta Falcons 2.\nNew York shut out Atlanta's offense, outgaining them in total yards 442–247, while also limiting them to 4/14 on third down conversions and 0/3 on fourth down attempts resulting in a dominating win in their only playoff game to date at MetLife Stadium.\nBoth teams combined for just one first down over their first five possessions. Eventually, Atlanta managed to sustain a drive, but on the first play of the second quarter, quarterback Matt Ryan was stuffed for no gain on fourth down and one on the Giants 24-yard line. Two plays later, New York quarterback Eli Manning gave Atlanta the first points of the game by committing intentional grounding in the end zone, resulting in a safety that made the score 2–0. After forcing a punt, New York earned their first score with an 85-yard drive, featuring a 34-yard run by Brandon Jacobs, that ended with Manning's 4-yard touchdown pass to Hakeem Nicks, giving them a 7–2 lead.\nIn the second half, a 30-yard run by Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw set up a field goal by Lawrence Tynes. Atlanta responded with a drive to the New York 21-yard line, but once again they came up empty when Ryan was tackled for no gain on fourth and one for a second time. A few plays later, New York increased their lead to 17–2 with Manning's 72-yard touchdown completion to Nicks. In the fourth quarter, Manning threw his third touchdown pass, a 29-yarder to Mario Manningham. Meanwhile, all that lay in store for Atlanta were more punts and their third failed fourth down conversion attempt of the day.\nManning threw for 277 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while Jacobs added 100 all-purpose yards. Nicks caught six passes for 115 yards and two scores.\nThe win marked New York's first playoff win since their victory in Super Bowl XLII and their first home playoff win since their victory in the 2000 NFC Championship Game; they were defeated in the 2005–06 playoffs by the Carolina Panthers in the wild card round and lost in the divisional playoffs to the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2008 season after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Atlanta's playoff losing streak reached four games with the loss. It was the first playoff game an offense was shut out since the Giants were shut out by the Carolina Panthers in 2005.\nThis game was also notable for the fact that it was the first game in NFL postseason history in which a safety was the only score awarded to a team.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Giants.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 29, Pittsburgh Steelers 23 (OT).\nThis game was the first one ever played under the league's new overtime rules, in which winning would be more difficult for the team that won the coin toss because the game would not end on an opening field goal. It did not matter, as it took Denver just one play to win with Tim Tebow's 80-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas.\nPittsburgh scored on their opening drive, with Ben Roethlisberger's 33-yard completion to tight end Heath Miller setting up a 45-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, Steelers running back Isaac Redman rushed five times for 33 yards on a 47-yard drive that ended with Suisham's 38-yard field goal, increasing the score to 6–0.\nBut Denver, which gained just eight yards in the first quarter, suddenly exploded with offensive production in the second. On their first drive of the quarter, Tebow completed a 51-yard strike to Thomas. Then he followed it up with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. Following a Pittsburgh punt, Tebow's 58-yard completion to Thomas set up his own touchdown on an 8-yard run, giving the Broncos a 14–6 lead. An interception by Quinton Carter quickly led to a 20-yard field goal from Matt Prater, and before the end of the half, Prater added one more, the second set up by Tebow's 41-yard completion to tight end Daniel Fells. With time running out in the quarter, Roethlisberger completed a 25-yard pass to Antonio Brown and an 18-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders on a drive that advanced to the Broncos 32-yard line. But on third down, a fumbled snap resulted in a 23-yard loss, pushing the team out of field goal range.\nPittsburgh regrouped in the second half. After its defense forced a punt, Roethlisberger completed an 18-yard pass to Sanders and Redman broke off a 32-yard run on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by receiver Mike Wallace on an end-around play, cutting the score to 20–13. Denver struck back with their third field goal from Prater, aided by a 32-yard pass interference penalty on Ike Taylor, but Pittsburgh responded with their own field goal-drive, featuring a 28-yard run by Redman, making it a one-score game at 23–16.\nWith 7:35 left in regulation, Denver running back Willis McGahee lost a fumble while being tackled by Ryan Mundy, and linebacker LaMarr Woodley recovered it at the Steelers 45-yard line. Though Roethlisberger was sacked on the first play, he recovered with a 15-yard completion to Sanders and a 6-yard run before tying the game with a 31-yard touchdown completion to Jerricho Cotchery. Both teams had one more drive to attempt a winning score, but Denver could go no further than their own 35-yard line, while Roethlisberger was sacked twice on his drive as time expired in the fourth quarter.\nFollowing a touchback on the opening kickoff, Pittsburgh anticipated that Denver would take to the ground, so the Steelers defense put all 11 players within six yards of the line of scrimmage. But Tebow hit Thomas in stride on a slant pattern across the middle of the field, and he took the ball 80 yards to the end zone for the game-winning score.\nTebow completed only 10 of 21 passes, but threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns without any interceptions, and added 50 yards and a touchdown on the ground, and also set a franchise record for passer rating in a playoff game, with 125.5. Thomas had 204 yards and a touchdown on just four receptions, an average of 51 yards per catch. Defensive end Robert Ayers had two sacks. For the Steelers, Redman finished with a career-high 121 rushing yards.\nMany observers have pointed out the symbolism of Tebow's 316 passing yards in comparison to the Biblical passage of . Tebow – known for his strong religious beliefs – had the number in black under his eyes when he led the Florida Gators in winning the 2009 BCS National Championship Game, which was played exactly three years to the day before this playoff game. Additionally, he set a playoff record by averaging 31.6 yards per completion. The only interception of the game was thrown by Roethlisberger on third down and 16. The Nielsen ratings for the game also peaked at 31.6. Pittsburgh's time of possession was 31:06. In addition, Thomas, who caught the winning touchdown pass in overtime, was born on Christmas Day in 1987.\nDenver won its first playoff game at home since defeating the New England Patriots in the 2005 playoffs, with their next game seeing them lose to the same Steelers. Pittsburgh failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, after winning the AFC Championship Game the year prior.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Steelers and Broncos. Both teams split the first six meetings. Pittsburgh won the most recent meeting 34–17 in the 2005 AFC Championship Game.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 14, 2012.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 36, New Orleans Saints 32.\nAlex Smith's 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis with nine seconds left gave San Francisco their first playoff win since 2002 at the end of a wild, back and forth final quarter which featured four lead changes in a span of 3:53.\nNew Orleans started off the game with a 78-yard drive to the 49ers 2-yard line, but came up empty when Donte Whitner forced a fumble from Pierre Thomas that was recovered by linebacker Patrick Willis. Thomas was injured on the play and did not return. Later on, San Francisco opened up the scoring with Smith's 49-yard touchdown pass to Davis. A few plays into the next drive, Dashon Goldson intercepted a pass from Saints quarterback Drew Brees and returned it 41 yards to the 4-yard line, setting up Smith's touchdown completion to Michael Crabtree and giving the 49ers a 14–0 lead. Then Courtney Roby lost a fumble on the kickoff that San Francisco linebacker Blake Costanzo recovered on the Saints 13-yard line. This time New Orleans managed to keep them out of the end zone, but David Akers kicked a field goal to give the 49ers a 17–0 lead less than a minute into the second quarter.\nBrees led the Saints back, completing seven consecutive passes for 65 yards and rushing for five on an 80-yard drive that ended with his 14-yard scoring pass to tight end Jimmy Graham. Then after a punt, he threw a 25-yard touchdown completion to Marques Colston, cutting the deficit to three points. Later on, Brees threw his second interception, this one to Tarell Brown, but San Francisco could not convert and the score remained 17–14 at the end of the second quarter, despite four Saints turnovers.\nEarly in the second half, Costanzo forced a fumble from Darren Sproles on a punt return and Colin Jones recovered it, leading to Akers' second field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Saints managed to close the gap back to three points with a franchise postseason record 48-yard field goal from John Kasay. But a 42-yard run from San Francisco's Frank Gore helped put the margin back up to six on Akers' third field goal of the day.\nWith 4:02 left in the game, New Orleans took their first lead of the game at 24–23 with Brees' 44-yard touchdown pass to Sproles. But it lasted less than two minutes before San Francisco took it back, with Smith hitting Davis for a 37-yard gain before taking the ball into the end zone himself on his career long 28-yard run, making the score 29–24 after the two-point conversion failed. Not to be outdone, Brees matched the score with his fourth touchdown pass of the day, a 66-yard completion to Graham, and then threw the ball to Sproles for a successful 2-point conversion, giving the Saints a 32–29 lead.\nSan Francisco got the ball back on their own 15-yard line with 1:37 left in the game. Smith started the drive with two completions to Gore for 18 yards. Then after an incompletion, he connected on a 47-yard pass to Davis, advancing the ball to the Saints 20-yard line. A 6-yard completion to Gore then moved the ball to the 14, where Smith spiked the ball to stop the clock. On the next play, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Davis with nine seconds left, who managed to hang onto the ball despite a hard hit from Roman Harper while he was still in mid-air, earning San Francisco their first conference championship game since 1997.\nSmith threw for 299 yards and three touchdowns without an interception, while adding 28 yards and a touchdown on the ground. He was the first quarterback in NFL playoff history to lead two go-ahead touchdowns in the final three minutes of a game. Davis caught seven passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns, breaking Kellen Winslow's NFL postseason record for receiving yards (166) by a tight end. Gore rushed for 89 yards and caught seven passes for 38. For the Saints, Brees completed 40 of 63 passes for 462 yards and four touchdowns, with two interceptions. His top target was Sproles, who caught an NFL playoff record 15 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown, while adding 59 more yards on rushing and special teams returns. Graham caught five passes for 103 yards and two touchdowns, while Colston caught nine passes for 136 yards and one score.\nDavis' game-winning touchdown catch occurred four days after the 30th anniversary of The Catch – Joe Montana's touchdown pass to Dwight Clark in the 1981 NFC Championship against the Cowboys – known as the most famous play in 49ers history. San Francisco had another famous playoff win in the 1998 Wild Card round against the Packers on a last second touchdown pass from Steve Young to Terrell Owens known as The Catch II. Sports writers and 49ers fans dubbed Davis' catch as The Catch III, also considering that all three times, the 49ers were trailing with less than a minute to go at Candlestick Park and facing 3rd and 3. The league later seconded the moniker on social media.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Saints and 49ers.\nIn April 2012, leaked audio of a pre-game team meeting of Saints defensive coordinator Greg Williams from a day before the game that was captured by Sean Pamphilon showed that bounties where placed by the Saints to injure Alex Smith, Michael Crabtree, Vernon Davis, Kyle Williams, Frank Gore, and Kendall Hunter as a part of the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal.\nAFC: New England Patriots 45, Denver Broncos 10.\nNew England quarterback Tom Brady completed 18 of 25 passes for 246 yards and a postseason record five touchdowns in the first half as the Patriots dominated the game the whole way through, setting new franchise postseason records for total yards (509), points (45), and margin of victory (35). Brady finished with six touchdown passes, while Denver quarterback Tim Tebow completed just nine of 26 passes, and the Denver offense had 14 plays that lost yardage.\nNew England scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 80 yards in five plays, including a 43-yard run by Aaron Hernandez, before finishing it off with Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker. Denver responded with a drive to the Patriots 37-yard line, but Tebow lost a fumble while being sacked by Rob Ninkovich, and New England linebacker Brandon Spikes recovered it. Brady went right back to work, completing five consecutive passes for 47 yards on the way to a 10-yard touchdown toss to Rob Gronkowski.\nAfter a punt, Quinton Carter intercepted a pass from Brady and returned it 17 yards to the New England 24-yard line. On the last play of the quarter, Tebow kept the drive going with a 12-yard completion to Demaryius Thomas on third and 3, and then Willis McGahee ran the ball into the end zone from five yards out, cutting the score to 14–7.\nHowever, this would be the closest scoring margin the Broncos would reach for the rest of the game. At the end of New England's next drive, Zoltan Mesko's 40-yard punt pinned Denver back at their own 5-yard line. After a three and out, the Patriots got the ball back with great field position at their own 48. Brady then completed four consecutive passes for 41 yards, the last one a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Later in the quarter, New England increased their lead to 28–7 on Brady's 61-yard touchdown completion to Deion Branch. And after forcing a punt, Brady threw a 20-yard completion to Hernandez, and an 11-yarder to Julian Edelman on the way to his 19-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 35–7 with just five seconds left in the half.\nThe second half didn't get any better for the Broncos. New England forced a punt on the first drive, which Edelman returned 15 yards to the Broncos 42-yard line. Five plays later, Brady tied a playoff record with his sixth touchdown pass of the day, a 17-yarder to Hernandez. Denver responded with Tebow completing an 18-yard pass to Matt Willis and a 15-yard pass to Eddie Royal on fourth down and 3. However, New England halted the drive at their 24-yard line, forcing them to settle for a 41-yard field goal by Matt Prater. In the fourth quarter, Brady completed two passes to Gronkowski for 48 yards to set up the last score of the day, a 20-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski making the final score 45–10, New England's first playoff victory since the 2007 AFC Championship Game.\nBrady completed 26 of 34 passes for 363 yards and six touchdowns. Gronkowski caught 10 of those passes for 145 yards and tied a playoff record with three touchdown receptions. Ninkovich had four solo tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble. McGahee was the top rusher of the game with 76 yards and a touchdown, while Thomas was Denver's top receiver with six receptions for 93 yards, including a 41-yard catch in the fourth quarter. The Broncos also gave up a postseason record of 16 negative yardage plays from the line of scrimmage.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Broncos and Patriots. Denver won both previous meetings, including handing Tom Brady his first playoff loss 27–13 in the 2005 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 15, 2012.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 20, Houston Texans 13.\nDespite gaining 227 yards, Baltimore's defense forced four turnovers, which included Ed Reed's clutch interception on his own 4-yard line with less than two minutes left, to win the game and send the Ravens into their third AFC Championship Game in franchise history.\nHouston's Danieal Manning returned the opening kickoff 60 yards to the Ravens 41-yard line, setting up a field goal by Neil Rackers. Their defense quickly forced a punt, but returner Jacoby Jones fumbled the ball and cornerback Jimmy Smith recovered for Baltimore on the Texans 2-yard line. Two plays later, Joe Flacco put the Ravens on the board with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Kris Wilson, Wilson's first reception of the year. Then after forcing a punt, Flacco's 21-yard completion to Anquan Boldin set up a 48-yard field goal from Billy Cundiff, making the score 10–3. Later in the quarter, Baltimore cornerback Lardarius Webb intercepted a pass from T. J. Yates at the Houston 34-yard line. On third down and 9, Ray Rice kept the drive going with a 20-yard gain on a screen pass, and Flacco ended up finishing it off with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Boldin.\nIn the second quarter, Houston managed to fight back. First, Arian Foster rushed three times for 29 yards and caught a pass for 16 on a 59-yard drive that ended with Rackers' second field goal, cutting the score to 17–6. Then after a punt, Foster rushed for 53 yards, including a 28-yard burst on the first play, on a 12-play, 86-yard drive that consumed just 5:46 and ended with his 1-yard touchdown run, making the score 17–13. Baltimore responded with a drive to the Texans 33-yard line. But on third down, J. J. Watt sacked Flacco for a 9-yard loss, pushing the Ravens out of field goal range.\nOn Houston's first drive of the second half, Yates completed a 17-yard pass to Andre Johnson and a 19-yarder to Kevin Walter, moving the ball to the Ravens 32-yard line. But Baltimore halted the drive there and Rackers missed a 50-yard field goal try. The Ravens then took the ball back and drove all the way to the Texans 1-yard line, but Rice was stuffed for no gain by Tim Dobbins on fourth down – Dobbins' only tackle of the game – and they failed to score.\nMidway through the fourth quarter, Webb recorded his second interception of the day on the Ravens 29-yard line, and Baltimore converted the turnover with a 44-yard field goal, taking a 7-point lead at 20–13. Yates responded with two completions to Johnson for 34 yards, moving the ball to the Ravens 38-yard line. But on the next play, Reed picked off a deep pass from Yates on his own 4-yard line with less than two minutes left in regulation. Houston still managed to force a punt with 45 seconds left, but the Ravens defense rose to the occasion once again, forcing a turnover on downs at their own 43-yard line.\nFlacco threw for 176 yards and two touchdowns. Webb had four tackles and two interceptions. For Houston, Foster rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown, while also catching five passes for 22 yards. Johnson was the top receiver of the game with eight receptions for 111 yards. Watt had 12 total tackles (nine solo) and 2.5 sacks, while linebacker Brooks Reed had six solo tackles, 2.5 sacks, and a forced fumble.\nThis was Baltimore's first home playoff game since 2006, and their first home playoff win since 2000.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texans and Ravens.\nNFC: New York Giants 37, Green Bay Packers 20.\nFor the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in five seasons, the No. 1 seed in the NFC lost its opening game as New York topped Green Bay behind a career postseason high passing yardage day from Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\nThe Giants received the opening kickoff, and scored on the opening drive with a 31-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes. The Packers responded with a game-tying field goal on their opening drive, when their kicker Mason Crosby hit a 47-yard field goal. New York scored again on the following drive as Manning threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to receiver Hakeem Nicks.\nOnce again, the Packers responded on the following drive when Aaron Rodgers threw a touchdown pass to fullback John Kuhn on the first play of the second quarter. Green Bay was aided by a controversial call on the drive where receiver Greg Jennings was ruled down by contact on a play where replays showed that he had lost the ball, but after Giants coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call the play was upheld. Kuhn's touchdown tied the score at 10. Green Bay then attempted an onside kick to try and catch the Giants off guard, but New York recovered in Packer territory. However, on the drive that followed Tynes saw his 40-yard field goal attempt blocked.\nNew York recovered a fumble by Kuhn with 3:37 left in the half and on the first play of the ensuing drive Manning found Nicks for a 29-yard gain to the Green Bay five-yard line. The drive stalled afterward and Tynes kicked his second field goal of the game from 21 yards out. After forcing a Packers punt on their next drive, Manning and the Giants advanced into Packers territory on third down with a 23-yard run by Ahmad Bradshaw to put the ball at the Packers' 37. More importantly, Bradshaw was able to get out of bounds and stop the clock which gave the Giants four seconds to run one final play before the half. Manning then converted a Hail Mary pass in the end zone that was caught by Nicks, who secured the catch by holding the ball against his helmet in a play reminiscent of Manning's pass to David Tyree in Super Bowl XLII. The extra point made the score 20–10 in favor of New York at the half.\nThe Packers turned the ball over on their first drive of the second half after Rodgers was sacked by Osi Umenyiora and Deon Grant recovered the ball after Rodgers fumbled. However, Green Bay got the ball back after forcing a three-and-out and scored on the next drive when Crosby converted his second field goal. It was the last scoring play of the third quarter, as neither team was able to put a drive together for a score.\nGreen Bay moved into New York territory but the drive was stalled at the Giants' 39-yard line early in the fourth quarter. Coach Mike McCarthy elected to go for the first down on fourth and 5 but Rodgers was sacked by Michael Boley and the Packers turned the ball over on downs. The Giants scored on their possession with a third field goal by Tynes, this time from 35 yards. New York then capitalized on a fumble by Ryan Grant on the second play of the following drive as Chase Blackburn recovered and took the ball to the Packers' 4-yard line. Manning then zipped a touchdown pass to Mario Manningham on the first play of the new possession and gave the Giants a 30–13 lead.\nNew York appeared to have stopped the Packers' on a third down when Rodgers threw an incomplete pass to Donald Driver but Umenyiora was called for hitting Rodgers late and the Packers received a new set of downs. Six plays later Rodgers found Driver for a 16-yard touchdown to cut the Giants' lead to 30–20. However, they failed to recover the onside kick as Victor Cruz fell on the ball after Spencer Paysinger failed to control the kick from Crosby initially. It took New York six plays to score again when Brandon Jacobs ran it in from 14 yards out.\nTrailing 37–20, the Packers took the field trying again to score as they had on their last drive. After hitting Jordy Nelson for an 11-yard gain on the first play Rodgers was then sacked by Umenyiora. After a short pass to James Starks that resulted in the loss of a yard Rodgers tried to throw to Jermichael Finley, but the pass was intercepted by Grant and the Giants ran out the clock from there.\nWith the victory the Giants advanced to their fifth NFC Championship Game and first since 2007, when they defeated the Packers to advance to the Super Bowl. Manning passed for a postseason career high 330 yards on 21-for-33 passing and three touchdowns. Nicks caught seven passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns while Cruz added five catches for 74 yards and Manningham caught three passes for 31 yards and one touchdown. In the defeat, Rodgers finished with 264 yards on 26-for-46 passing, two touchdowns, and an interception. Jennings led the Packers in receptions with four for 40 yards while Driver added three and led the team in receiving yards with 45. New York forced four turnovers (the interception and three fumbles) and sacked Rodgers four times.\nGreen Bay was playing in its first playoff game at home since the aforementioned 2007 NFC Championship Game and lost for the second consecutive time. The Packers became the first team to win at least fifteen games during the season and not advance beyond their first playoff game and became the fourth team after the 1998 Vikings, the 2004 Steelers, and the 2007 Patriots to win at least 15 games during the season and not win the Super Bowl. As previously mentioned, the Packers became the fourth team in five years – 2007 Cowboys, 2008 Giants, and 2010 Falcons – to get the NFC's top seed and lose their first playoff game. This was also the sixth consecutive year in which the defending Super Bowl champion failed to win a playoff game. The win by the Giants also was the first win by a road team in the 2011–12 NFL playoffs.\nThe Giants' win was their fifth consecutive away from home in the playoffs. Dating back to their 2007 Super Bowl season, the Giants played games in Raymond James Stadium, Texas Stadium, University of Phoenix Stadium, and Lambeau Field twice (including this game) and won each game.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Giants and Packers, with Green Bay having won four of the prior six meetings. New York won the last meeting 23–20 in overtime in the 2007 NFC Championship Game.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 22, 2012.\nAFC: New England Patriots 23, Baltimore Ravens 20.\nWith New England clinging to a 23–20 lead near the end of the game, Patriots safety Sterling Moore broke up consecutive passes in and near his own end zone, forcing Baltimore to attempt a 32-yard field goal to send it into overtime. But Billy Cundiff's kick was wide left, earning New England their seventh Super Bowl appearance in franchise history.\nAfter the game started with four punts, New England receiver Julian Edelman's 10-yard return gave his team good field position on their 39-yard line. The Patriots then drove to the Baltimore 11-yard line, aided by an illegal contact penalty on Lardarius Webb that wiped out an interception, and scored with Stephen Gostkowski's 29-yard field goal. New England quickly forced a punt, but Webb eventually intercepted a pass – for his third interception in two games – from Tom Brady on his own 30-yard line. On the next play, Joe Flacco's 42-yard completion to Torrey Smith moved the ball to the Patriots 28. However, New England's defense managed to halt the drive at the 3-yard line, where Cundiff kicked a field goal to tie the game.\nIn the second quarter, New England drove 75 yards to score the first touchdown of the game. The key player on the drive was running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, who rushed five times for 33 yards and finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown run. Baltimore struck right back with an 80-yard scoring drive, with Flacco hitting Anquan Boldin for 37 yards and Lee Evans for 20 before finding tight end Dennis Pitta in the end zone to tie the game back up at 10. But New England retook the lead on their next drive, with Brady completing five of seven passes for 60 yards on the way to Gostkowski's second field goal, making the score 13–10 at the end of the half.\nNew England started off the second half with another long scoring drive, moving the ball 74 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. But on third and two, Green-Ellis was tackled for no gain, so Gostkowski kicked his third field goal to give them a six-point lead. Later in the quarter, Baltimore took their first lead of the game, 17–16, on Flacco's 29-yard touchdown pass to Smith. Then Ravens receiver LaQuan Williams – a college teammate of Smith at the University of Maryland – forced a fumble from kick returner Danny Woodhead that Emanuel Cook recovered for Baltimore at the Pats 28-yard line, setting up Cundiff's second field goal to make the score 20–16.\nWoodhead returned the ensuing kickoff 41 yards to the 37-yard line, and the Patriots offense took the ball to the end zone from there, featuring a 23-yard reception by tight end Rob Gronkowski. On fourth down on the Ravens 1-yard line, Brady took the snap and dove over a pile of players for a touchdown, giving New England a 23–20 lead. Late in the fourth quarter, Patriots linebacker Brandon Spikes picked off a pass from Flacco and returned it 19 yards to midfield. Brady tried to capitalize on the next play with a deep pass to the end zone, but Bernard Pollard deflected the ball and Jimmy Smith made a diving interception just before it hit the ground. Then he got back up and returned the ball to the Ravens 39-yard line. Baltimore subsequently drove to the Patriots 30-yard line, but on third and three, Vince Wilfork dropped Ray Rice for a 3-yard loss. Rather than attempt a 50-yard field goal, Baltimore decided to go for it on fourth down, but Flacco's pass was incomplete and the team turned the ball over.\nThe Ravens defense forced a punt with 1:44 left, giving them one last chance to tie or win the game. Three receptions by Boldin for 41 yards helped move the ball to the Patriots 13-yard line. But Moore made two critical pass deflections to keep them out of the end zone. First, Evans appeared to haul in a touchdown pass, but Moore knocked the ball out of his arms just before he held it long enough for a reception. Then on third down, he broke up a pass intended for Pitta at the 2-yard line. Cundiff then came onto the field to try a 32-yard field goal attempt which would have sent the game into overtime for the first time in an AFC Championship Game in 25 years (this didn't occur until the 2018 AFC Championship). However his kick was wide left, enabling New England to run out the rest of the clock.\nFlacco threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Boldin caught eight passes for 101 yards. Brady won his 16th postseason game as the Patriots quarterback, tying the NFL record held by Joe Montana. He also joined John Elway as one of the only quarterbacks ever to play in five Super Bowls.\nThe missed kick – and the fact that the football's laces were not out, as customary during placekicks – drew comparisons to the fictional kicker Ray Finkle from the 1994 film \"\", who missed a similar short-range last-second kick in their version of Super Bowl XVII. The memory of Myra Kraft inspired the Patriots and some fans credited her intervention for the miss. Robert Kraft said \"We had an angel looking out for us.\"\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Patriots. Baltimore won the only prior meeting 33–14 in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nReactions.\nNone of the Ravens players blamed the loss entirely on Cundiff.\nLinebacker Terrell Suggs told ESPN that there was a miscommunication on the sideline prior to the missed field goal. He blamed it on the scoreboard, which he said inaccurately stated there was a first down. In fact, the Ravens were one yard shy.\nPunter Sam Koch said the play felt rushed. Cundiff himself said he was late getting on the field.\nCundiff pointed the finger at himself alone following the game, but stated that these moments do not define a player, and that he had intended to move on with his career. He said that he had made kicks like that 1000 times before, and that there was no excuse. He said it is a lesson he would learn from. He said he hoped to make amends during the next season. Despite his statement, Cundiff was cut by the Ravens before the start of the 2012 season in favor of rookie kicker Justin Tucker.\nRavens fans reacted to the loss with shock and were described as \"heartbroken\".\nUniversity of Kansas basketball fans mocked Cundiff during a game that took place the following day. This included holding up white cardboard letters that spelled out C-U-N-D-I-F-F, and tilting them to the shooter's left, during the game whenever an opponent shot a free throw.\nNFC: New York Giants 20, San Francisco 49ers 17 (OT).\nFor the fifth time in conference championship history and for the third time in five years, overtime decided the game, and as it was in the 2007 NFC Championship Game, a field goal by Lawrence Tynes was the winning score as the Giants defeated the 49ers for their fifth NFC Championship Game victory. The Giants became the third team in NFL history to advance to the Super Bowl with fewer than 10 wins during a 16-game regular season, joining the 1979 Los Angeles Rams and the 2008 Arizona Cardinals. (Additionally, Green Bay won Super Bowl II after a 9–4–1 season.)\nThe 49ers scored the first touchdown of the game as quarterback Alex Smith connected with tight end Vernon Davis deep for a 73-yard touchdown pass midway through the opening quarter. Davis was called for an excessive celebration penalty after he climbed atop the camera tower in the back of the end zone, which forced David Akers to kick off from the 49ers' 20-yard line. San Francisco took possession of the ball on downs when New York failed to convert a fourth-and-1 situation from their 34-yard line. On the first play of the ensuing drive the 49ers attempted an end-around reverse play where receiver Kyle Williams would be the ball carrier. Williams, however, could not handle the handoff on the end-around and fumbled the ball but was able to recover when the ball squirted out of the grasp of a Giants defender. The 49ers punted three plays later, but this would not be the last time Williams' ball-handling would cause his team trouble during the game.\nThe Giants tied the score on the next drive, as Eli Manning found tight end Bear Pascoe for a six-yard touchdown pass to complete a 10-play, 69-yard drive. Manning completed passes to wide receiver Victor Cruz twice on the drive, one for a large gain that afforded New York the football in San Francisco territory. It was among two of 10 catches that Cruz made during the game. They then gained the lead on the last drive of the half, as Tynes converted the first of two successful field goals with a 31-yard kick. Cruz was again Manning's key target on the drive, with four receptions including a catch that set up Tynes' attempt. With 5:18 remaining in the third quarter, the 49ers regained the lead on Smith's second touchdown pass. San Francisco was able to move the ball 54 yards in six plays and was aided by Williams' 24-yard return of Steve Weatherford's punt; Williams was playing the position of punt returner in place of Ted Ginn, Jr., who missed the game with an injury. Frank Gore caught a pass from Smith on the second play of the drive for a 24-yard gain to the New York 28-yard line whereupon Davis caught his second touchdown pass on the next play to give the 49ers a 14–10 lead.\nAfter the teams traded punts on the next three possessions, the 49ers began on their own 12-yard line as the third quarter was drawing to a close. An eleven-yard run by Gore was followed by a short completion from Smith to tight end Delanie Walker for seven yards. However, Chris Canty was called for a roughing the passer penalty, which added fifteen yards to the end of the play and advanced the ball to the San Francisco 45-yard line as the fourth quarter began. Gore ran for six yards on the next play, with Anthony Dixon adding three more on the play after that. Chase Blackburn and Linval Joseph made a tackle on the third down play to stop the drive at the New York 46-yard line. Instead of going for it, the 49ers elected to take a delay of game penalty and punt the football back to the Giants. \nThe ensuing drive for the Giants started at their own 20-yard line, but the 49ers held them to a three and out with two Manning incompletions sandwiched around an Aldon Smith sack. Weatherford again came out for a punt, with Williams standing ready to field the ball at his own 38-yard line. The ball hit the turf at the 45-yard line and bounced back toward Williams, who chose to let the ball continue rolling down the field. Giants receiver Devin Thomas, seeing this, began sprinting toward the ball and picked it up near the 30-yard line. The officials gave the 49ers possession at the spot where Thomas had picked the ball up. Thomas, however, was insistent that Williams had touched the ball first, and ran the rest of the way into the end zone with the ball; if he was right, possession would have gone back to the Giants on a muff and a recovery, but the ball would be placed at the spot of the recovery since muffed punts, by rule, are unable to be advanced by the recovering team.\nTom Coughlin decided to take a chance and threw his red challenge flag onto the field to ask the officials to review the play. The replay showed that the ball had touched Williams' right knee at the spot where he attempted to field it, and the Giants received possession at the spot where Thomas picked the ball up, which was determined to be the 29-yard line of San Francisco. It took seven plays for New York to reach the end zone from there, with a 15-yard pass from Manning to Mario Manningham giving them the lead again. \nThe 49ers responded on their next possession and on the first three plays, they achieved successive first downs. The first was awarded as the result of a defensive foul, as Kenny Phillips was flagged for illegal use of hands, while the following two were earned by Smith and Kendall Hunter on running plays. Three plays later, Akers was called on to kick the game-tying field goal as the drive stalled at the New York 8-yard line. Akers converted tying the game at 17–17. The rest of the fourth quarter was uneventful as the teams traded possessions six times. The Giants punted three times while the 49ers did so twice, and regulation ended on a play where tight end Delanie Walker fumbled the football.\nAfter a lengthy description of the current playoff overtime rules by referee Ed Hochuli, New York won the coin toss and elected to receive the opening kickoff of overtime; however, four plays later, they elected to punt the football. With the new overtime rules in place, this meant that since both teams had taken possession of the ball, the game was now sudden-death where the first team to score would win the football game. However, San Francisco could not advance the football on their possession and the 49ers elected to punt the football after three plays. The Giants started their drive from their 36-yard line and advanced near midfield on third down, but Manning was sacked by Justin Smith and Weatherford came out for his twelfth punt of the game. Once again, Williams fielded the kick. After returning the ball five yards Giants linebacker Jacquian Williams reached in and stripped the football from Williams and Thomas recovered it at the San Francisco 24-yard line. It was Williams' second official fumble and second lost fumble, and the last time the 49ers would possess the ball.\nAhmad Bradshaw carried the football on three successive plays and rushed for eight, six and four yards to the San Francisco six yard line. On the fourth snap, Manning simply took the ball to the middle of the field and kneeled, which brought up third down. Tynes was called out onto the field for what was a 26-yard field goal, but the Giants were called for a delay-of-game penalty, making it a 31-yard attempt. Tynes alleged there was a patch of dirt at the 16-yard line and felt more comfortable kicking 5 yards back. After San Francisco called timeout to try to attempt to distract Tynes, he converted the field goal successfully despite a low snap. With the victory, the Giants moved on to Indianapolis to play the Patriots in the Super Bowl.\nAs had happened in the previous four conference championship games that required overtime to decide them, the winning margin was a field goal. Tynes became the first person to kick the winning field goal in overtime twice and became the first since Garrett Hartley of the New Orleans Saints did so in the 2009 NFC Championship Game. New York became the second consecutive team to win three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl after the Packers won three road playoff games the year before. San Francisco lost its second consecutive NFC Championship Game where they served as the host team, having lost the 1997 NFC Championship Game at home to the Packers. The 49ers dropped to a win–loss record of 1–5 in NFC Championship Game appearances since their victory in 1990 over the Los Angeles Rams to advance to Super Bowl XXIV; the Giants handed the 49ers two of those losses (one of them in very similar fashion to this game 21 years earlier) and the Dallas Cowboys also defeated them twice. Meanwhile, New York won their fifth NFC Championship Game in as many tries and won their third conference championship game on the road in the process. The three road wins all came on the last play of the game (1990, 2007, and this game), while the two home wins were both by shutout (1986 and 2000).\nManning, despite being sacked six times and constantly under pressure by the 49ers, was praised for his gutsy performance. He completed 32 of 58 passes for 316 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers in the rainy contest. Smith had 196 passing yards and two touchdowns – both to Davis – finishing 12-for-26. This was Smith's last 49ers playoff game as he was replaced by Colin Kaepernick in 2012. Bradshaw and Gore each rushed for 74 yards while Cruz led all receivers with 10 catches for 142 yards. Davis caught three passes for 112 yards and two touchdowns. Of San Francisco's six sacks, defensive end Ray McDonald had a team-high two and a half. Justin Tuck led New York with one and a half of the team's three sacks. San Francisco fumbled the football on four occasions and Williams lost the two fumbles which were the only turnovers of the game. There were twenty-two combined punts in the game, as Weatherford and Andy Lee recorded twelve and ten punts, respectively. The 49ers converted only one third down in 13 opportunities.\nThis was the eighth postseason meeting between the Giants and 49ers. San Francisco had won four of the prior seven meetings, including 39–38 in the 2002 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLVI: New York Giants 21, New England Patriots 17.\nThis was the second Super Bowl matchup between the Giants and Patriots, with New York pulling off the upset in Super Bowl XLII."

        "text": "The 2012 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2011 season. It took place at 2:00 pm local time on Sunday, January 29, 2012, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The AFC defeated the NFC, 59–41.\nThe 59 points scored by the AFC team were a Pro Bowl record, and the combined 100 total points was third in the series' history, behind the 2004 Pro Bowl, and the 2024 Pro Bowl Games. Miami Dolphins wide receiver Brandon Marshall was named the game's Most Valuable Player after catching four touchdown passes, breaking the record for touchdown receptions in a Pro Bowl which was set by Jimmy Smith in 2004.\nThe AFC team was coached by Gary Kubiak of the Houston Texans while Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy led the NFC all-stars. The referee for the game was Walt Coleman.\nAFC roster.\nThe following players were selected to represent the AFC:\nNFC roster.\nThe following players were selected to represent the NFC:\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally by NBC. The telecast of the game garnered a Nielsen rating of 7.9 nationally. While this represented an eight percent drop over the 2011 Pro Bowl ratings, the game was still the second most watched Pro Bowl of the past twelve years. The game drew more viewers than the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. NBC also broadcast the 2013 game as Super Bowl broadcaster CBS had declined to carry it.\nSocial media.\nThe NFL loosened its rules which forbid players from communicating via social media during games, by setting up a computer on each sideline to allow players to use Twitter. Washington Redskins linebacker London Fletcher used the occasion to propose a contest among his Twitter followers to predict the game's final score and MVP. However, the NFL had him rescind the offer and he instead gave away a signed jersey instead of cash, presumably on anti-gambling grounds.\nEntertainment.\nThe pop band Hot Chelle Rae played during the pregame ceremonies for the game. United States Air Force Technical Sergeant Richard Vazquez sang the national anthem before the kickoff. Several representatives of the U.S. Armed Forces participated in the coin toss ceremony: Major General Rodger Mathews, U.S. Army Pacific deputy commander; Lieutenant General Thomas L. Conant, U.S. Marine Corps Pacific command deputy commander and USAF Major General Darryll Wong, adjutant general of the Hawaii Air National Guard. The halftime show, \"NFL Salute to Service,\" was a tribute to the United States Armed Forces featuring the U.S. Army Silent Drill Team along with over a thousand service members stationed at bases in Hawaii.\nReactions.\nSimon Samano of NFL.com wrote about the game, \"Players love the trip to Hawaii but don't care for the game itself. They have no desire to risk injury in a 'meaningless' game, which is why they don't play hard, which is how you end up with 59–41 as the final score. It's that lack of effort that caused fans to boo during portions of this year's game.\" Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers stated on his radio show, \"I was just surprised that some of the guys either didn’t want to play or when they were in there didn't put any effort into it.\" The Pro Bowl has different rules than a regular season NFL game. Blitzing is not allowed and the 4–3 formation must always be used in defensive formations.\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking a week after the game, stated that the 2012 Pro Bowl wasn't \"the kind of football we want to be demonstrating to our fans, and you heard it from the fans, the fans were actively booing in the stands. ... We are going to either have to improve the quality of what we are doing in the Pro Bowl or consider other changes, or even consider eliminating the game if that is the kind of quality of game we are going to provide.\"\nPhilip Rivers also questioned some of the players efforts in the Pro Bowl game. Rivers discussed with Bill Williamson during an interview “In general, maybe the whole week should be up for discussion, but I know there are guys in the game whose contracts may be up and they don’t want to get hurt and things like that. Still, we have to think of the fans and try to stay true to the game and not make a joke or a mockery out of the game.\""

This organisation, in 1982, was replaced by the \"AFVD\", the American Football Association of Germany.\nA national league, originally the \"American Football Bundesliga\", later to be renamed the German Football League, was formed in 1979, consisting of six clubs, the Frankfurter Löwen, Ansbach Grizzlies, Düsseldorf Panther, Munich Cowboys, Berlin Bears and Bremerhaven Seahawks. The first-ever league game was held on 4 August 1979, played between the Frankfurter Löwen and the Düsseldorf Panther, and ended in a victory for Frankfurt. The first ever German Bowl was held on 10 November 1979 and also ended in a victory for the Frankfurter Löwen.\nIn 1980 and 1981, the league and American football in Germany saw a split with Düsseldorf and Bremerhaven leaving the competition to take part in a separate, short-lived competition, the \"Nordwestdeutsche Football-Liga - NFL\", but, by 1982, union was restored and the renegade teams returned.\nIn 1981, the German national team was formed, winning its first-ever international, a game against Italy, 12–6.\nOn 16 October 1982, the \"AFVD\" was officially formed and, in the following year, it was decided to form regional associations as well. The German national team, also from 1983 onwards, started to participate in the European Championships. In 1986, women's American football began to develop, with the first official game held in 1987.\nAmerican football started to boom in Germany from the early 1990s onwards, initiated through the Frankfurt Galaxy, which attracted many younger fans to the sport and also provided some media attention.\nAs of 1 January 2010, the \"AFVD\" announced a new record membership of 40,051, and increase of 7.31 percent in comparison to the previous year. The associations growth since the year 2000, when it had 18,875 members, is mainly due to the improved youth programs of its clubs. While, in the early years, very few clubs had a youth team, it is now commonplace to have a number of junior teams in every club.\nIn 2018, the AFVD reached a new peak by counting 63,060 members.\nWith triumphs in the European Championships of American Football 2001, 2010 and again 2014 as well as dominant performances of German club teams in the BIG6 European Football League since its inception in 2014, the AFVD has established itself as one of the premier American Football associations in Europe, if not the world.\nLeague system.\nThe league system in American football in Germany operates as a pyramid, with clubs in every league being able to achieve promotion and relegation, subject to their final standings and the promotion and relegation games.\nMen.\nIn 2010, the pyramid consisted of six levels, however, tier six leagues did only exist in some regions.\nThe top level of the league system, the GFL, is a national league with inter conference games between the two regional divisions. The second level, the GFL2, is divided into two regional divisions without inter conference games. The third level is the \"Regionalliga\" (), divided into five separate leagues. Below this, the seven \"Oberligas\" () are set, followed by the \"Verbandsligas\" (), \"Landesligas\" () and \"Aufbauligas\" ():"

        "text": "John Sterling (born September 15, 1964) is a former American football running back who played for the Green Bay Packers in the National Football League (NFL). He played in two games with the Packers during the 1987 NFL season as a replacement player after the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) went on strike for 24 days. Sterling played college football for the University of Central Oklahoma where he was named as an honorable mention All-American by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in 1987.\nEarly life and college.\nJohn Sterling was born on September 15, 1964, in Altus, Oklahoma. He graduated from Altus High School before attending the University of Central Oklahoma, where he played running back for the Central Oklahoma Bronchos football team. During Sterling's first season and a half with the Bronchos, he saw limited playing time. However, halfway through the 1985 season, he took over as a starter. That year he was the team's second leading rusher and scored nine touchdowns. During the 1986 season, he set a career high for yards in a game, rushing for 213 yards and three touchdowns against Abilene Christian University. Sterling was noted for his speed, with his coaches believing it gave him a shot to continue playing football professionally. In 1987, Sterling was named as an honorable mention on the NAIA All-America team after rushing for 879 yards on 122 carries during the season.\nProfessional career.\nSterling was not drafted in the 1987 NFL draft. He signed with the Green Bay Packers but was released shortly before the start of the 1987 NFL season. After the second week of the season, the NFLPA went on strike. The third week of the season was cancelled, but weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. Sterling was signed back to the Packers roster on October 10 as a replacement player, the day before the week 5 game against the Detroit Lions. Prior to signing with the Packers, Sterling was also on the Denver Broncos replacement team. He played two games for the Packers, rushing five times for 20 yards."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Rugby-Bundesliga was the 40th edition of this competition and the 91st edition of the German rugby union championship. In the Rugby-Bundesliga, the first division, nine teams played a home-and-away season with a finals round between the top four teams at the end. The season started on 28 August 2010 and finish with the championship final on 28 May 2011, interrupted by a winter break from December to late February. Cold weather and heavy snow falls however meant that the last game before the winter break was played already on 6 November 2010.\nThe championship was won by Heidelberger RK, the defending champion, who defeated SC 1880 Frankfurt 12-9 in the final, marking the third season in a row that these two teams played each other in the championship game, being the only two professional sides in German rugby. Heidelberg had won the 2010 final while Frankfurt triumphed in 2009. It as the eighth championship for \"HRK\". The two finalists of 2009 and 2010 are the only two clubs in Germany considered professional, the remaining clubs and players are all amateurs.\nBelow the Rugby-Bundesliga sits the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga, which is divided into two divisions with ten teams each. With the RC Luxembourg, a team from Luxembourg, a non-German side competes in the league in 2010-11, the club having joined the German league system in 2009.\nIn the 2nd Bundesliga, TV Pforzheim won the championship and promotion without dropping a game, while northern champion TSV Victoria Linden declined promotion for a second year in a row.\nOverview.\nThe 2009-10 modus is identical to the previous season. However, the competition had been reduced from ten to nine teams, after the withdrawal of the ASV Köln Rugby during last season and no team from the 2nd Bundesliga accepting promotion. Like in 2008-09, the top four teams qualify for the finals. The two semi-finals winners then contested the championship final.\nAt the bottom end of the table, nominally the last two teams are relegated while the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga champions are promoted, however, this is subject to the 2nd Bundesliga champions accepting promotion and a decision on the league strength for 2011-12. In February 2011, the \"DRV\" decided that the league would continue to play with ten teams in the future.\nAs a sign of the gap between the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga, TSV Victoria Linden, who only won the 2009-10 North/East division in the last round of the championship, declined promotion, citing the additional cost of travelling and the limited player pool as their reason. The South/West champion, Stuttgarter RC, also declined promotion because of the loss of eight first-team players at the end of the season, originally leaving the Bundesliga with only eight clubs for the next season. \"DSV 78\" protested the decision to reduce the league to eight teams again and thereby relegating the club, and was ultimately permitted to stay in the league.\nIn the 2nd Bundesliga, SC Siemensstadt and TV Pforzheim are new teams for 2010-11, while FT Adler Kiel Rugby and RC Mainz were relegated. A third team, the Karlsruher SV Rugby, withdrew from the league during the 2009-10 season.\nAfter suffering nine defeats in eleven games, the SC Siemensstadt withdrew its team from the North/East division of the 2nd Bundesliga in March 2011.\nBundesliga table.\nThe final standings in the table:\nBundesliga results.\nThe results of the Bundesliga in 2010–11:\nPlayer statistics.\nTry scorers.\nThe leading try scores in the Rugby-Bundesliga 2010–11 season were (10 tries or more):\nPoint scorers.\nThe leading point scores in the 2010–11 Rugby-Bundesliga season were (100 points or more):\nPer club.\nThe top try and point scorers per club were:\nSemi-finals and final.\nFinal.\nThe 2011 final of the Rugby-Bundesliga was a closely contested game. Frankfurt lead the game from early on until almost the end of regular time. A late try by New Zealander Jesse Westerlund however equalised Frankfurt's lead, followed by a conversion by South African Pieter Jordaan. A desperate attack by Frankfurt in injury time was not rewarded and Heidelberg was able to defend its narrow lead and thereby its German title.\n2nd Bundesliga tables.\nSouth/West.\nThe final standings in the table:\nNorth/East.\nThe final standings in the table:"

With odds of 91–1, winning horse Donerail is the longest odds winner in Kentucky Derby history.\nPayout.\nThe 39th \"Run for the Roses\" still holds the record for the highest for the winner having the highest odds. In a small field of only eight horse Donerail entered the race at 91–1.\nDonerail.\nIn 1913, Donerail set a record that still stands today. Owned by Thomas P. Hayes, the thoroughbred entered the Kentucky Derby at 91-1 odds. In fact, Hayes was not convinced that he should enter the horse at all. In a field of only eight horses, the money favorite Ten Point had the best starting position at number four. Donerail started at post five, but passed Ten Point and won by only half a length. Donerail's win was especially remarkable when one considers the economic living standards in 1913. The average household income at the time was about $3,000. The United States was largely made up of farming communities. In today's economy, a $10 bet on Donerail paid out nearly $26,031. The horse would go on to be on the leaderboard in half of his lifetime races. After his record-making win in the Kentucky Derby, Donerail continued to race until 1916, when he was retired to Glen-Helen Farm.\nThomas P. Hayes.\nDonerail was bred by Thomas P. Hayes, who decided to keep the colt. Hayes chose the thoroughbred's name after a small community near Lexington. Trained by his owner, Donerail's first races were less than impressive and Hayes had no confidence that he was able to perform well in the Kentucky Derby. He told Roscoe Goose, the jockey, to find another mount. Goose continued to beg Hayes to enter Donerail in the Kentucky Derby, and when a friend of Hayes, William J. Treacy paid the entry fee, Donerail was added to the field. The win of Donerail also put Hayes in the history books: it was only the second time in history that the same person bred, trained, and owned the Kentucky Derby winner.\nRoscoe Goose.\nDonerail's jockey Roscoe Goose was a descendant of one of the pioneer families in the Louisville area. He was confident of the potential of the horse and even told friends that he believed Donerail could win the Kentucky Derby. Roscoe's brother, Carl, was also a jockey and he was killed in a riding accident. Roscoe committed to teach and train young jockeys. He was instrumental in adding the requirement for the jockeys to wear helmets. Roscoe Goose became a trainer, breeder, owner, and elder statesman of horse racing. [2]He would mentor the great jockey Eddie Arcaro. In 1963, Roscoe Goose was one of the first athletes named to the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. He died in 1971 and is buried in Louisville's Cave Hill Cemetery.\nDerby Day 1913.\nMay 10, 1913, was a beautiful sunny day. The newly renovated Churchill Downs was packed with 30,000 people to watch the race. Twelve horses were expected to compete, but four scratched before the race, leaving a field of only eight. In addition to his record-making odds, Donerail won the Derby with the fastest time recorded to that point. The favored horses for the race that day were Ten Point (at post four), Foundation (at post eight) and Yankee Notions (at post six)."

        "text": "The Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union is the union responsible for rugby union in the county of Gloucestershire, England and is one of the constituent bodies of the national Rugby Football Union. Formed in 1878, it has won the county championship on numerous occasions.\nHistory.\nThe Union was formed at a meeting held at Gloucester in September, 1878. At that meeting, the clubs represented were Clifton RFC, Gloucester RFC, Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester RFC, Rockleage, Stroud, and Cheltenham White Cross. The Union was formed mainly due to the efforts of J. D. Miller, J. H. Dunn, and J. F. Brown. all of whom were amongst the Union's first officers. For many years, the playing strength depended almost entirely on the Clifton and Gloucester Clubs. In the first five seasons the Union side only lost two of seventeen fixtures in Inter-County matches. The RFU recognised its success by electing in 1880 J. D. Miller to represent the West of England on the central executive. Ironically, the representative side then went through a period in which they had a very poor record. From 1883 to 1889 the team played only 10 times and of these 6 were lost, 3 drawn, and only 1 won. It was noted that the fortunes of the county side mirrored the success of the Gloucester City club side. When the Gloucester City side revived in the early 1890s, so to did the County, and in the seasons 1889-90, 1890–91, 1891–92, Gloucestershire lost two matches only.\nIn the first year of the County Championship (1890–91) Gloucestershire were the winners in the South-Western group, but when they entered the second phase, they were crushed by Lancashire.\nCounty side.\nHonours.\nFrom 1984 all Championship finals were played at Twickenham.\nNotable players for the County side.\nMany notable players have represented the county.\nAffiliated clubs.\nFormed by Clifton RFC, Gloucester RFC, Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester RFC, Rockleage, Stroud, and Cheltenham White Cross, by 1891, the Union consisted of ten clubs, viz.,\nGloucester, Clifton, Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, Bristol, Cheltenham, Lydney, Sharpness, Dursley, Stroud, and Gordon Wanderers (Gloucester). In its early days, only Gloucester City was rated as a first class side, and this was deemed the county's weakness. Since then, the fortunes of the constituent clubs has varied enormously.\nToday there are 74 clubs affiliated with the Gloucestershire RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. Geographically, most clubs in the RFU are from Gloucestershire or Bristol, although several teams are based in bordering counties such as Somerset. In turn clubs are affiliated with one of the five combinations – Bristol, Cheltenham, Forest of Dean, North Gloucestershire and Stroud – that make up the Gloucestershire RFU.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Gloucester RFU currently runs the following club competitions for club sides in Gloucestershire and parts of Bristol:\nLeagues.\nDiscontinued leagues:\nCups.\nAlthough in the past there has been a cup covering the whole of the county, Gloucestershire currently has competitions for each of the five affiliated bodies that make up the Gloucestershire RFU. These are as follows:\nBristol Combination\nCheltenham Combination\nForest of Dean Combination\nNorth Gloucestershire Combination\nStroud &amp; District Combination"

Each league match was played over 14 legs. If a player won his eighth leg before the 14th leg, no further legs were played after this point. Two points were awarded for a win and one point awarded for a draw.\nGary Anderson won his first major title, defeating world champion Adrian Lewis 10–4 in the final. He is the first player to win the title on his debut appearance (except from the inaugural tournament) and this was the first final to feature neither of the top 2 players from the group stage.\nThis edition of the Premier League contained the most non-English players ever to compete in the same edition of the tournament at four (Raymond van Barneveld, Gary Anderson, Simon Whitlock and Mark Webster).\nMark Webster recorded the worst ever run of matches from weeks 7–11, winning just 6 legs in 5 matches, in a run that culminated in his failure to win any of his last 10 matches and finish with just 5 points and −49 leg difference, the worst ever record from a Premier League season. This stood until Glen Durrant was eliminated with nine consecutive losses and 0 points in the 2021 edition of the tournament.\nQualification.\nThe PDC's top four players following the Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship on 4 January qualified by right to compete in Premier League Darts, and were joined by four wild card selections. Two were chosen by the PDC and two wild card qualifiers by broadcasters Sky Sports. The line-up was confirmed on 4 January 2011.\nVenues.\nFifteen venues were used for the 2011 Premier League, with the only change being The O2 Arena giving London a second venue, replacing Coventry.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund remained at £410,000 for the 2011 tournament.\nResults.\nLeague stage.\nOn 4 January 2011, the PDC announced via their official website that Phil Taylor would play against Adrian Lewis on the opening event of the League on 10 February.

M-Wave has hosted three World Speed Skating Championships since the Olympics, while the Spiral has hosted a couple of world championships in bobsleigh, luge and skeleton.\nBefore the Olympics.\nNagano first attempted to host the Winter Olympics in 1940, but lost out to Sapporo. Those Olympics were abandoned in 1937, when Japan invaded China for the second time, forcing Sapporo's withdrawal. The city tried again for the Winter Olympics in 1968 in 1961, but lost out in domestic voting to Sapporo who in turn lost out to Grenoble, France in 1964. Sapporo would host the Winter Olympics finally in 1972. A third time for the Winter Olympics began in 1983, with a full bid for the Winter Games approved two years later. With the bid committee established in 1986 and lessons learned from previous mistakes, Nagano's bid for the Winter Olympics in Japan was approved in 1989. A revamped bid committee was launched later that year with presentations given to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1990. When the IOC session was held in Tokyo in September 1990, Nagano was among the cities launching promotional campaign for the 1998 Winter Olympics. The following June at the IOC session in Birmingham, England, Nagano was awarded the 1998 Games in the fifth round, defeating Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States by four votes.\nKaruizawa, near Nagano, played host to the World Allround Speed Skating Championships in 1963 and the World Sprint Speed Skating Championships in 1986. For the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Karuizawa played host to the equestrian events.\nSite selection for events were adjusted between the time of bidding and the actual games. For alpine skiing, women's downhill, women's super-g, women's giant slalom, and men's giant slalom were moved from Mount Higashidate to Mount Yakebitai following a 1993 inspection by the International Ski Federation (FIS). Biathlon was planned to be at a new venue in the Kamishiro area of Habuka. The venue was moved to Nozawa Onsen Ski Resort following an environmental assessment of the area that included nests of goshawks and buzzards under CITES, the 1973 global endangered species act better known as the \"Washington Convention\", before construction began. Figure skating was planned originally for a municipally owned gymnasium in Nagano, but was abandoned to it not having enough room for expansion. Meanwhile, short track speed skating was planned to take place on renovated city property, but the venue's popularity with local residents changed that plan. As a result, White Ring Arena was constructed to accommodate both figure and short track speed skating. Alpine combined was set to have the downhill part at Happo'one Resort and the slalom part at Mount Yakebitai, but the logistical differences in adverse weather conditions forced the slalom part to be moved to Happo'one Resort.\nVenue construction started in 1990, and was completed prior to the 1998 Winter Games. Temporary facility construction started in June 1997, and was completed in time for the 1998 Games.\nFor test events, M-Wave Arena in Nagano hosted the World Allround Speed Skating Championships in 1997. That same year, the Iizuna Kogen Ski Area hosted the FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships. The biggest test event controversy occurred at the Happo'one Resort for the men's downhill event in February 1996, when the FIS, supported by most of the leading skiers, stated that the was too short. The request by FIS and the skiers was to move the start of the course up either by or 15 seconds. The Nagano Organizing Committee (NAOC) refused to move the course on the grounds that it be moved into a protected national park Special Zone and that it would contradict one of NAOC's Vision of Coexistence with the environment. The FIS pointed out that over 600,000 skiers annually participated in that zone annually, and questioned why Olympic-class skiers could not compete in that same area. A threat to not hold the event in Japan was also issued by the FIS. It would not be until 1–2 November 1997 before a compromise could be reached among the FIS, IOC, and NAOC, where the start was moved up to its final length of .\nDuring the Olympics.\nKazakoshi Park Arena in Karuizawa gave the city its distinction as the only first to ever host both Summer and Winter Olympic events (Several venues for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were reused when the city hosted the Winter Olympics 14 years later.).\nWeather was a major role in the outdoor events. Heavy rain at the Spiral cancelled the second run of the bobsleigh four-man event. Seven of the ten events in alpine skiing were delayed by weather, four of which were the women's.\nSnow Harp had the men's 30 km take place after 18 hours of heavy, wet snowfall which was won by Finland's Mika Myllylä. The women's 5 km event was held in a snowstorm while the women's 10 km combined event was held during a steady rain. Both events were won by Russia's Larissa Lazutina. In the men's 4 x 10 km relay, Norway avenged their loss to Italy in this event four years earlier at Lillehammer, with Thomas Alsgaard edging out Silvio Fauner by 0.2 seconds, the closest event finish in Olympic history.\nDuring the ski jumping individual normal hill event at the Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium, the final two jumpers on the second jump were delayed from their jumps to high winds. Finland's Jani Soininen jumped 89 meters to advance one point ahead of Japan's Kazuyoshi Funaki. Funaki's teammate Masahiko Harada, who led after the first jump, needed a jump of 88 meters to win gold, but only jumped 84.5 meters and ended up in fifth place. Soininen would later complain bitterly about the officials' decision despite his gold medal win. In the individual large hill event, Funaki jumped so far that he landed beyond the video measuring area which resulted in the distance being measured manually. Funaki's jump was recorded as 132.5 meters and it also garnered perfect style points. The Japanese ski jumper would win gold in the event.\nBoth Nordic combined events had their cross-country portions held in pouring rains. Norway won the team event while Norwegian Bjarte Engen Vik won the individual event.\nFog led to cancellation of the biathlon's men's 10 km sprint event and a rescheduling of the event the following day. At the time of the cancellation, 16 of the 73 skiers had completed the course, including the leader Alexandr Popov of Belarus. When the race was rerun the next day, Popov skied poorly and finished 55th, leading Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, who was present at the first race, to call the cancellation \"a mafia-style injustice\". The rerun race would be won by Norway's Ole Einar Bjørndalen, who was leading Popov during the first run after 8 km before the event was cancelled.\nGusty winds at the Iizuna Kogen Ski Area affected the women's aerials freestyle skiing event, which was won by America's Nikki Stone.\nAfter the Olympics.\nM-Wave Arena hosted the World Sprint Speed Skating Championships in 2004. The arena hosted the World Single Distance Championships in 2000 and 2008.\nThe Spiral hosted the skeleton portion of the FIBT World Championships in 2003. The following year, the venue hosted the FIL World Luge Championships, the only time the championships have taken place in Asia as of 2017."

        "text": "The 2014 World Lacrosse Championship was held July 10–19 at Dick's Sporting Goods Park outside Denver, Colorado. 38 nations played 142 games in this international men's lacrosse championship tournament organized by the Federation of International Lacrosse. Nine nations—Belgium, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, and Uganda—all competed in the event for the first time.\nIn the championship game on July 19, Canada captured its third gold medal by upsetting the United States 8–5 in front of 11,861 fans. Canadian goalie Dillon Ward was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player after he made 10 saves in the championship game, becoming the first goalie to ever receive the honor.\nThe Iroquois Nationals finished third by defeating Australia 16–5 in the bronze medal game. It marked the first time the Iroquois earned a medal at the World Lacrosse Championship, as well as the first time the Australians failed to earn a medal since 1974.\nUS Lacrosse, the national host, organized a lacrosse festival for boys' and men's lacrosse teams to play alongside the world championships. Players from around the world competed in 11 age divisions from U11 to 60-and-over.\nPool play.\nFor pool play, participating nations were separated into nine divisions. The countries with the top six rankings—Australia, Canada, England, Iroquois, Japan, and the United States—competed in the Blue Division, where the top two teams advanced to the semifinals and the next two teams advanced to the quarterfinals. In the other divisions, each first through fourth place teams were placed in first through fourth play-in brackets. \nBlue Division.\nAfter not competing in the 2010 tournament in England due to passport issues, the Iroquois Nationals had to appeal to the FIL to play in the elite Blue Division, usually reserved for the top six teams from the previous championship. After originally placing Germany in the Blue Division, the FIL granted the Iroquois' appeal in 2013.\nTeam USA coasted through the Blue Division games, only tested by Canada's early 3-0 lead in the opening game of the tournament. But the U.S. scored the next eight goals and ended up putting away their strongest rival 10-7. Canada also easily defeated the lower ranked teams, but needed a goal from Curtis Dickson with 19 seconds remaining to beat the Iroquois Nationals 9-8.\nIroquois, Australia, Japan, and England played several close games for the right to get to the championship bracket. Japan lost a double-overtime game vs Australia but won in overtime over England.\nPlay-in brackets.\nPlay-in games were played between the teams of all divisions except Blue.\nChampionship bracket.\nAfter losing to the United States 10–7 in the first game of the tournament, Canada dominated the championship game. They played a deliberate, slow-down offense that is allowed under international rules, combined with strong defense, ground ball play, and goaltending. Like in the first game, Canada jumped out to an early lead, 2–0 after the first quarter. Team USA managed only one goal in the first half, and only put 5 shots on net. At the half, Canada was up 3–1, with Kevin Crowley scoring all three Canadian goals. Crowley got two more in the second half to lead all scorers with 5 points. Canada played even better in the third quarter, scoring five straight goals to increase its lead to 8–2 in the first minutes of the final period. The U.S. added three goals at the end to make the final score 8–5, but they were never in the game in the fourth quarter. Tournament MVP Dillon Ward made 10 saves in goal for Canada. U.S. attackmen Kevin Leveille had three goals and Rob Pannell had three assists.\nIn the third place game, the Iroquois Nationals easily defeated Australia 16–5 to earn their first medal in international men's field lacrosse. The team earned 4th place in the 1998, 2002, and 2006 tournaments but didn't compete in 2010. The Thompson brothers – Jeremy, Hiana, Miles and Lyle – combined for six goals and five assists. \nClassification brackets.\n5th to 8th place.\nDespite falling to rival England in the fifth-place game, Scotland earned its best-ever finish at the championships by placing sixth. The Scottish team defeated Japan in the previous contest, and are expected to replace the Japanese in the elite Blue Division at the next world championship tournament.\nPlaying in its first-ever world championships, Israel very nearly duplicated Scotland's feat, twice narrowly falling in games that could have advanced the team into the Blue Division. After reaching the quarterfinals, the Israelis led Australia in the third quarter before dropping a tough 9-8 decision. Then in a placement round game, Israel made a dramatic comeback to push England to overtime before suffering a 10-9 setback. Israel finished seventh after defeating Blue Division squad Japan.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given out at the end of the tournament.\nMVP: Dillon Ward \nOutstanding Attackman: Rob Pannell \nOutstanding Midfielder: Paul Rabil \nOutstanding Defenseman: Tucker Durkin \nOutstanding Goalie: Dillon Ward\nThe President's Team.\nThe President's Team consisted of the following players, honored for being the top 10 players in the tournament not competing in the Blue Division.\n Kyle Buchanan \n Ryan Licht\n Matt MacGrotty \n Jimmy McBride \n Jordan McBride \n Jonathan Munk \n Kevin Powers \n Ben Smith \n Ari Sussman \n James Van de Veerdon\n Brendan JR Murphy "

        "text": "Åke Gustav \"Plutten\" Andersson (8 June 1918 – 11 May 1982) was a Swedish ice hockey, football and bandy player and manager, known for representing Hammarby IF in all three sports.\nHe represented his country at two Winter Olympic games, finishing fourth in 1948 and winning a bronze medal in 1952. He was the captain of the Swedish national team from 1945 until his retirement in 1954.\nEarly life.\nAndersson grew up in a working-class home in a southern part of Stockholm known as Södermalm. His father was working as a groundskeeper at Hammarby Idrottsplats, the home of local club Hammarby IF which he joined at age 14.\nAthletic career.\nIce hockey.\nIn 1934, Andersson started to play hockey with Hammarby IF in Elitserien, Sweden's top tier.\nHe won six Swedish championships – in 1936, 1937, 1942, 1943, 1946 and 1951 – with the club. In total, Andersson made 351 competitive appearances for Hammarby, scoring 150 goals. He played 23 seasons in the Swedish top league, a domestic record.\nHe was known as a hard-working player with a lot of stamina, possessing a good tactical mind and a great sense of play. He was also good at positioning himself and had good offensive qualities. Andersson was, among other awards and prizes, crowned as \"Sweden's best hockey player\" seven years in a row. Andersson formed a strong defensive pairing with the physical defenceman Rune Johansson for several seasons.\nAndersson decided to stay with Hammarby during his whole career, even though he had frequent offers from other teams in Sweden. About his love for Hammarby, Andersson said the following in November 1957:\nHe won 62 competitive caps for the Swedish national team, scoring a total of 18 goals, and regularly captained the side. Andersson represented his country at six major tournaments, and his biggest achievements were winning the bronze medal in the 1952 Winter Olympics and Sweden's first ever World Championship win in 1953.\nHe is a recipient of the honorary award Stora Grabbars Märke and was inducted into the Swedish Hockey Hall of Fame in 2012; both awards are handed out by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. In total, he made 134 appearances for Sweden, including friendlies and exhibition matches, between 1937 and 1954.\nAndersson retired from hockey at the end of 1958, at age 40, due to a fracture. He was the head coach of Hammarby between 1960 and 1962.\nFootball.\nIn 1937, at age 19, Andersson debuted in the senior football team of Hammarby IF. Up until 1951, Andersson made 231 league appearances for Hammarby, mostly in the Swedish second tier Division 2, scoring 40 goals, playing as a midfielder.\nIn 1939–40, Hammarby competed for one season in Allsvenskan, the domestic top league, with Andersson playing 13 of 22 fixtures, but was relegated immediately.\nHe was the player-manager of Hammarby for one season in 1950–51 together with Folke Adamsson, after which he decided to retire from football.\nBandy.\nAndersson was also a prominent bandy player for Hammarby IF between 1932 and 1947. He was a member of the Swedish national team and won a total of seven caps for his country. As well as in ice hockey, Andersson is a recipient of the honorary award Stora Grabbars Märke in bandy, an award that is handed out by the Swedish Bandy Association.\nPersonal life.\nHe was the younger brother of Stig Emanuel Andersson, who also was a celebrated sportsman. His nephew Börje Andersson also played hockey and made one season with Hammarby IF in 1968–69."

Due to questions about the level of his competition, Williams did not receive heavy publicity or recruiting attention in high school. \nCollege career.\nWilliams committed to Maryland on October 21, 2008.\nFreshman.\nWilliams started 31 games as a freshman for the 2009–10 Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team. He was an All-ACC rookie team selection. Williams finished second in rebounding in the ACC. Maryland coach Gary Williams complimented Williams' growth as a player as the season progressed.\nSophomore.\nBefore his sophomore season, Williams was named to the preseason watch list for the Wooden Award and Naismith Award watchlists. In a January 22, 2011 victory over Clemson, Williams recorded his thirteenth straight Double-double, which set a Maryland record. He broke a streak previously held by Len Elmore. He was picked to the Third Team All-America by Fox Sports.\nAfter the season, Williams submitted his name to the NBA draft. Initially, he did not sign with an agent, which left open the possibility of staying in college. He later hired an agent, which precluded a return to collegiate basketball.\nProfessional career.\nOn June 23, 2011, the New Jersey Nets drafted Williams with the 36th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. During the 2011 NBA lockout, he agreed to play for the Polish team Zastal Zielona Góra.

Later that month, Williams was recalled by the Nets.\nOn July 11, 2012, the Nets traded Williams, Johan Petro, Jordan Farmar, Anthony Morrow, and Deshawn Stevenson to the Atlanta Hawks for Joe Johnson. The Hawks requested waivers on Williams on September 17, 2012.\nOn August 28, 2013, he signed a one-year deal with Bilbao Basket. However, on September 8, he parted ways with the club."

The Australian Police team played two games against Argentina. The first was a 40-4 win for the Australian Police, with a crowd of 87 people attending. The second game was a 60–6 win for the Australian Police with a crowd attendance of 71.\nThe sport then remained dormant in the country for over 10 years before being revived in 2016 amidst a number of other South and Central American nations taking up the sport. Argentina saw its first domestic activity for a decade in November 2016 when it hosted the Primer Torneo Sudamericano de Rugby League, a slightly modified 9-a-side tournament in Miramar involving the national teams of Argentina and Chile, as well as a number of select sides from around the region which were bolstered by the Latin Heat organization. The final of the event was between the Argentinian and Chilean national teams, with Argentina winning 16-0.\nIn 2017, with great effort from the players and coaching staff, Argentina traveled to Chile by bus, to be in the inaugural Latinoamericano Championship. This was the first time that a Latin American championship was played with 13 players a side, three referees and full RLIF tournament rules. This event gave Argentina their first chance to earn World Ranking points and debut in the International Rankings. Argentina's first match of the tournament was a 36-6 win over Colombia. This win earned a spot in the Final against Chile with Argentina losing 32-12 to a team sporting a number of heritage players from Australia. The Argentinian team for the tournament was wholly made up of players from development and social leagues and no heritage players.\n2018 saw Argentina playing in the Confederação Brasileira de Rugby League Festival in Sao Paulo, beating Colombia 28-16 before losing to Brazil in the final by 22-20 despite leading 14-20 at one point.\nIn March 2024, Argentina was granted Observer Member status by the International Rugby League.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad selected for 2018 South American Rugby League Cup;"

He has won 124 caps for New Zealand (the All Blacks) and is their most-capped back.\nSmith played for New Zealand Maori in 2010, and was first selected for the All Blacks in 2012.

His last test match was the world cup final against South Africa on the 28th of October 2023.\nProvincial rugby.\nSmith made his debut for Manawatu in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup at the age of 19, making several substitute appearances for the Turbos. This included the historic 25–24 win over Canterbury in Round 1 and the 38–38 draw with Waikato in Round 3.\nFor the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, Smith established himself as the first-choice half-back for Manawatu, starting all 13 games over the course of the season and scoring his first representative try. He continued as the starter in the 2010 ITM Cup, and established himself as one of the top half-backs in the competition and earning a Super Rugby contract.\nIn the 2011 ITM Cup, Smith continued to improve and had a successful season, scoring five tries helping the improved Manawatu squad which reached the Championship final.\nSuper Rugby.\nSmith was included in the Blues wider training group for the 2010 Super 14 season, but did not see any game action for the Auckland-based side.\nFor the 2011 Super Rugby season, Smith signed for the Highlanders, coached by Jamie Joseph, who had previously coached Smith with New Zealand Māori. Smith had a successful debut season, beating out Sean Romans for the job as backup to starting half-back (and All Black) Jimmy Cowan, and made 12 appearances including 3 starts.\nInternational career.\nOn the back of his strong performances for Manawatu, Smith, of Ngāti Kahungunu descent, was selected to New Zealand Māori for their 2010 Centenary Series. He came on as a substitute against the New Zealand Barbarians after Chris Smylie suffered a fractured cheekbone, and started in the squad's historic victories over Ireland and England.\nOn the back of a successful Highlanders season Smith made his All Blacks debut on 9 June 2012, .\nBy the time of the 2013 season Smith had become the first choice halfback for the national team.\nSmith has been selected for every New Zealand squad since 2013, including the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad where he started in all the knockout games. Smith became the leader of the All Blacks' haka in 2016, following the retirement of Keven Mealamu and Liam Messam's decision to swap to New Zealand's rugby 7s squad, first leading the Haka against Wales at Eden Park.\nSmith played his 50th international test match in the final test against Wales, during the 2016 tour, alongside lock Brodie Retallick, with whom he debuted. Smith lost his place as the All Blacks' Haka leader later in the season due to off-field controversy, as well as strong competition for a starting place, from TJ Perenara. Smith was caught meeting a woman for sexual intercourse at an airport before getting on a flight for All Black duty. Smith was in a relationship at the time, to the woman that would be his future wife. Smith was retained as a regular starter into the 2017 season, when he started in all three tests against the touring British &amp; Irish Lions.\nSmith became the most-capped scrum-half in New Zealand's history in the 2018 season, breaking Justin Marshall's long-standing record on 17 November 2018. Despite the ongoing competition for his starting place through TJ Perenara, Smith was chosen to start against Ireland. Smith, during his record-breaking performance, failed to perform well, with the All Blacks losing 9-16. In March 2021 it was announced by New Zealand Rugby that Smith had signed a new contract with the All Blacks, the Highlanders and Manawatu that will see him stay in New Zealand until 2023.\nIn August 7, 2021 in a game at Eden Park, Auckland against the Wallabies Smith became the tenth All Black to register 100 tests and the first of Maori descent.\nIn 2023 Aaron Smith announced he had signed to play at Japanese club Toyota Verblitz after his international retirement. \nLeading of the haka.\nSmith has been the haka leader in 35 tests. 21 times he led the Ka Mate version of the haka as well as 14 times the newer Kapa o Pango haka.\nHonours.\nNew Zealand\nHighlanders"

        "text": "Michael McCarthy (born 27 November 1981) is an English-born retired Irish professional rugby union. He played his club rugby for the Irish provincial team Leinster Rugby in the Pro14, having joined from rival Irish team Connacht in 2013. He played in the second row and as a flanker.\nEarly life.\nMcCarthy was born and raised in England. He was educated at Sedbergh School.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nMcCarthy started his professional career playing for Premiership club London Wasps in the 2001–02 season. He made a single substitute appearance for the team in that year's Premiership against Sale Sharks, and did not play in any European games. The following season he made an increased number of appearances, playing three times in the 2002–03 Premiership as Wasps won the title. He also made two appearances in the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup, playing both first round ties against Overmarch Parma, including making his first start away to the Italians on 12 October 2002, in a tournament Wasps also went on to win, for a domestic and European double.\nConnacht.\nMcCarthy joined the Irish side Connacht in 2003. He made his debut from the bench in a Celtic League match away against Welsh side Cardiff Blues on 13 September. McCarthy played 16 times in total in the 2003–04 Celtic League, scoring two tries. He also made eight appearances in the European Challenge Cup as Connacht made it to the semi-finals, where they were narrowly beaten by eventual winners Harlequins over two legs. McCarthy left Connacht after one season, returning to English rugby with the Newcastle Falcons.\nNewcastle Falcons.\nMcCarthy made his debut for the Newcastle Falcons on 5 September 2004 against Worcester Warriors, scoring a try as the Falcons won 30–9. He made a total of 21 appearances in the 2004–05 Premiership and scored two tries. That season he helped the team reach the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup, starting all of the group games and scoring a try against the Newport Gwent Dragons. He also played in the quarter-final itself against Stade Français at Parc des Princes, as Newcastle were beaten 48–8 by the eventual runners-up.\nIn the following season's Premiership, McCarthy played 19 games, and scored three tries as Newcastle finished 7th in the league. After having been in the Heineken Cup the previous season, Newcastle dropped back into the European Challenge Cup. McCarthy played in four of their six group games, scoring three tries in a match with Italian side L'Aquila. In the following round the Falcons faced McCarthy's old side Connacht, and he scored a try in a 23–3 victory at Kingston Park. Newcastle went through to the semi-finals, where McCarthy played in a narrow defeat to London Irish, by a final score of 27–22. McCarthy was named the supporters' player of the season in 2006.\nMcCarthy played only nine games for Newcastle in the 2006–07 Premiership, but scored a try against the Sale Sharks. He also played five times in the Challenge Cup, scoring a try against Petrarca Padova, as Newcastle qualified for the quarter-finals. McCarthy did not feature in the quarter-final loss to Clermont. McCarthy left the Falcons in 2007, having played for the side 74 times.\nReturn to Connacht.\nMcCarthy rejoined Connacht at the beginning of the 2007–08 season. He played in 14 games for the team in the 2007–08 Celtic League. McCarthy also started in all 6 of Connacht's group games in the 2007–08 European Challenge Cup, which included two matches against his former side Newcastle. The 2008–09 saw him make fewer appearances in both competitions, playing in just nine of Connacht's 2008–09 Celtic League matches and four of their Challenge Cup games.\nIn the following season, McCarthy made a total 23 appearances for the team, including starting all of Connacht's matches in the Challenge Cup, as they made it to the semi-finals. The team faced a Toulon team featuring the English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, a former Newcastle teammate of McCarthy's. Toulon won 19–12 in Galway, with Wilkinson kicking 14 of the French club's points. The following season saw McCarthy start in every one of Connacht's 22 2010–11 Celtic League, and appear in all six of the team's Challenge Cup games, starting only one of these games on the bench, though Connacht failed to make it past the pool stages. He earned his 100th cap for Connacht that season, against Bayonne in the Challenge Cup on 15 January 2011.\nThe 2011–12 season saw Connacht qualify for the Heineken Cup for the first time. McCarthy started every one of Connacht's games, including the team's first ever win in the competition, in the home game against Harlequins. He also started 19 of Connacht's games in the Pro 12, the new name for the Celtic League. The following season saw McCarthy play 13 games in the 2012–13 Pro 12, scoring a single try. Connacht also played in the Heineken Cup, this time winning three of their six games, with McCarthy again an ever present. This was McCarthy's last season with the province however, as it had been announced in December 2012 that McCarthy would join rival Irish province Leinster at the end of the season. He left Connacht having made 134 appearances in his second spell with the team, and 160 appearances overall.\nLeinster.\nMcCarthy joined Leinster ahead of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut against Scarlets on 6 September 2013 in the Pro 12. He made his European debut for the side in October that year against the Ospreys, and went on to start all six of Leinster's pool games in the 2013–14 Heineken Cup.\nRC Narbonne.\nOn 6 March 2017, McCarthy signed a two-year contract with French club RC Narbonne in the Pro D2 ahead of the 2017–18 season.\nOn 17 May 2017, McCarthy confirmed that he would not be joining Narbonne and has been forced to retire due to an elbow injury.\nInternational career.\nIn his early career McCarthy was part of the English under-age set-up, but later switched his allegiance to Ireland. In January 2011, McCarthy received his first call up for Ireland as part of the squad for the 2011 Six Nations Championship. He was the only uncapped player named in the squad, but did not earn any caps in the tournament. In August that year, however, McCarthy made his Ireland debut in a Rugby World Cup warm-up game against Scotland at Murrayfield.\nMcCarthy was again part of the Ireland squad for the 2012 Six Nations. He was a late replacement for Donncha O'Callaghan in the 32–14 win over Scotland on 10 March. McCarthy again replaced O'Callaghan from the bench in the 30–9 defeat to England, seven days later.\nMcCarthy was called up for the 2012 November internationals. McCarthy played in each game, starting both full tests that Ireland played. He partnered Donnacha Ryan in the second row in the match against South Africa on 10 November, as well as the game with Argentina on 24 November. Two months later he was called up to the 2013 Six Nations squad. This championship saw McCarthy start four of Ireland's five games, missing the Scotland game through injury."

One of his sons, Lieutenant David Walton Fell, Royal Army Medical Corps, died of wounds in North Africa on 13 November 1942.\nFell was also a keen yachtsman, a passion developed in his youth at Nelson. Fell died at his home at Church Street North, Colchester, on 19 April 1953, aged 75.\nRugby union career.\nFell was a noted sportsperson, playing in his college's 1st XI and 1st XV (1894–1896).

Commentators from the time noted that he was a fast runner and good on attack, but lacked defensive ability.\nHis interest in rugby continued after he retired as a player, being one of the founders and first President of the Colchester Football Rugby Club from 1925 to 1939 and again from 1946 to 1949. The club was in recess over the war years.\nMedical career.\nFell followed his uncle, Walter Fell, into medicine. He studied at the University of Otago and then the University of Edinburgh where he graduated MB and ChB in 1902, proceeding to the MD in 1906. He won the Muir Cup in 1900 and was a double blue that same year. \nIn 1905 he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians and held house appointments at the Royal Infirmary, the City Fever Hospital and the Corstorphine Convalescent Hospital in Edinburgh. He relinquished this position in 1907 and settled in general practice at Colchester in 1907.

The Knights are a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American), and their current head coach is Johnny Dawkins, who is in his third year with the team.

Clark did not amass a single losing season during his 14-year career, and led the Knights to the Division II Final Four in 1978. His son, Bo Clark, holds the UCF records for career points (2,886) and points in a game (70). UCF has advanced to the NCAA tournament 4 times (94, 96, 04, 05), all under coach Kirk Speraw. The Knights were the 2005 Atlantic Sun Conference regular season and tournament champions, their last season in the league.\nOn December 1, 2010, the Knights upset the #16 Florida Gators 57–54, for the biggest win in program history, and giving the Knights their first victory over a top 20 opponent as well as their first victory over the Gators. Following a 10–0 start to the 2010–11 season under first year coach Donnie Jones, the Knights were nationally ranked for the first time in program history. At the time, UCF was one of nine unbeaten teams, and one of only four schools to be ranked in the BCS standings and the AP men's basketball poll.

They have previously been nicknamed the \"Orcas\" but in 2010 adopted the \"Titans\" nickname. The district was previously known as \"Nelson/Marlborough\".\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nNelson held one of the first New Zealand rugby league competitions in 1910 and the region produced four New Zealand representatives between 1910 and 1911; Charles James, Pat Hannigan, Dave Mason and Bert Feary. In many parts of New Zealand, rugby league went into recess with the outbreak of World War I.\nIn 1991 Nelson, who were coached by former Kiwi Kevin Dixon, played a three match series against Marlborough, winning the first 30-20 before losing the second 24-32 and drawing the third match 26-all.\nTasman district.\nA Nelson-Marlborough side first played as an independent district in 1977, who played Otago, Southland, West Coast, Canterbury etc but it was not until the 1997 season that the Tasman name was adopted.

        "title": "Dan Bailey (American football)",
        "text": "Dan Bailey (born January 26, 1988) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker in the National Football League (NFL). Bailey grew up in the Oklahoma City area and played college football for the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Following the 2011 NFL draft, Bailey signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent. He spent seven years in Dallas, where he became the franchise's all-time leader in field goals made. He played for the Minnesota Vikings from 2018 to 2020.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Oklahoma City, Bailey grew up in Mustang, Oklahoma, and attended Southwest Covenant School where he was an all-state, all-conference kicker and a first-team all-city punter (as selected by \"The Oklahoman\"), while playing eight-man football.\nAs a senior, Bailey had 51 touchbacks in 61 kickoffs. He holds the high school state records for longest field goal (50 yards), most field goals in a season (seven) and career (14). He was also an individual state champion golfer. Bailey graduated from Southwest Covenant and was named valedictorian of the class of 2007.\nCollege career.\nBailey originally accepted to walk on at University of Arkansas, in order to receive an academic scholarship that would cover his tuition. After losing the competition for the starting kicker job, he was approached by head coach Houston Nutt and told that he would have to pay his own way, so he wouldn't count toward the team's scholarship limit. Forced to leave the school, he spent one year out of college before walking on at Oklahoma State University.\nAs a true freshman in 2007, Bailey made 20-of-20 extra point kicks but only two-of-four field goals. Bailey made field goals from 27 and 28-yards and missed two attempts beyond 40-yards.\nUntil the 2008 Holiday Bowl, Bailey made 10 consecutive field goals in his second year (2008). With a 78.9% field goal conversion rate (15-for-19) on the season, he was second in the Big 12 Conference in field goal percentage. He made a career-long 45-yarder in the 2008 Holiday Bowl, a 42–31 loss to Oregon.\nBailey made 46-of-46 extra point attempts and 13-of-18 field goals in 2009 as a junior. In the October 17 game, a 33–17 win over Missouri, he made 4-of-4 field goals, including a career-long 51-yarder.\nIn 2010, Bailey made 24-of-28 field goals and 65-of-66 extra points. He won the Lou Groza Award for the nation's top kicker following the season. He earned the Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Year award. Oklahoma State won the December 2010 Alamo Bowl 36–10 over Arizona, and Bailey made three of three field goals in that game: from 40, 50, and 44-yards.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2011 season.\nBailey was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent following the 2011 NFL draft on July 25. At one point during training camp, he had to compete with three other place kickers who included David Buehler, Shayne Graham and Dave Rayner. Bailey was named the team's kicker at the end of the preseason, with Buehler remaining on the roster as the kickoff specialist.\nIn the second game of the regular season, against the San Francisco 49ers, after missing a chip shot attempt in the first quarter, he made a 48-yard field goal to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner from 19 yards.\nIn Week 3, an 18–16 win over the Washington Redskins, Bailey tied a rookie record by converting six field goals (accounting for all of Dallas' points). This was the first time since 2001 that the Cowboys won a game without scoring a touchdown and the sixth in club history. He became the third rookie in NFL history to make six field goals in a game, following in the footsteps of Garo Yepremian, who converted six-of-eight attempts on November 13, 1966, for the Detroit Lions, and Jeff Reed, who made all six tries on December 1, 2002, for the Pittsburgh Steelers. This performance earned him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors.\nOn November 20 (Week 11), Bailey kicked his second game-winning field goal, a 39-yard kick in overtime to help the Cowboys beat the Redskins 27–24.\nBailey missed a potential game-winning 49-yard field goal during the December 4 (Week 13) game against the Arizona Cardinals. With the game tied 13–13, with six seconds left in the fourth quarter, Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett called a time-out before the snap, but Bailey's kick was good. Following the time-out, Bailey kicked the field goal short and to the left, leaving many Cowboys fans frustrated, convinced Garrett had just iced his own kicker. In overtime, the Cardinals won 19–13 on a touchdown by LaRod Stephens-Howling.\nOn December 11 (Week 14), however, in a game against the New York Giants with the Cowboys trailing 37–34, Bailey's first attempt at a game-tying 47-yard field goal was interrupted when Giants coach Tom Coughlin called a time-out, effectively icing the kicker. Bailey's first kicked ball did go through the uprights. However, Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul blocked Bailey's kick after the Giants' timeout.\nBailey completed one of the best kicking seasons in franchise and league history by a rookie, making 32-of-37 (86.5%) field goals, second-highest kicking percentage for a rookie, setting a Cowboys rookie record for most field goals made in a game (6), tying Chris Boniol for the second-most consecutive field goals made (26) in club history, and was named to the Pro Football Writers Association All-Rookie team.\n2012 season.\nBailey converted three field goals from distances of 32, 26, and 22-yards in Week 3 (September 23), a 16–10 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His last field goal in the game put Dallas up 16–7, a two-possession lead with 2:47 left. Dallas lost the Week 6 (October 14) game 31–29 to the Baltimore Ravens after Bailey missed a last-second, 51-yard field goal. With 32 seconds left, Tony Romo completed a four-yard touchdown pass to Dez Bryant, but because the following two-point conversion failed, Bailey had to make an onside kick. Dallas recovered the kick, but his 51-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right with six seconds remaining.\nThe following game (Week 7, October 21) against the Carolina Panthers, Bailey kicked 28 and 38-yard field goals within the final four minutes in Dallas' 19–14 victory. In the Week 11 (November 18) 23–20 overtime win over the Cleveland Browns, he made the game tying 32-yard field goal with two seconds left in regulation and the winning 38-yard field goal in overtime.\nAfter trailing the Cincinnati Bengals 19–10 with 6:35 left, Dallas beat Cincinnati 20–19 in Week 14 (December 9). The fourth quarter comeback consisted of a touchdown pass by Romo and a last-second 40-yard field goal by Bailey.\nIn the Week 15 game on December 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bailey hit a game-winning 21-yard field goal following a 36-yard interception return by Brandon Carr. In overtime, the Cowboys won 27–24. This win kept the Cowboys' postseason hopes alive.\nBailey finished the 2012 season converting all 37 extra point attempts and 29 of 31 field goal attempts.\n2013 season.\nBailey set the franchise record for most field goals over 50 yards for a single season (6) and a career (11). In the 2013 season, Bailey converted all 47 extra point attempts and 28 of 30 field goal attempts.\n2014 season.\nOn January 23, Bailey and the Cowboys agreed on a new seven-year contract. His new contract was reported to be worth $22.5 million with a $4 million signing bonus and a total of $6.6 million in guaranteed money.\nOn September 21, Bailey set a franchise record with his 28th consecutive field goal, making a 40-yard attempt in the third quarter against the St. Louis Rams.\nOn October 5, he missed a potential game-winning 53-yard field goal against the Houston Texans at the end of regulation, breaking a franchise record streak of 30 consecutive makes dating back to the previous season. Bailey kicked the game-winning 49-yard field goal in overtime.\nOn October 12, Bailey became the most-accurate kicker in NFL history with a 42-yard made field goal in the second quarter of the Cowboys' 30–23 eventual win over the Seattle Seahawks. He has since dropped to twelfth on the all time list, on which the top six players are all currently active. He converted all 56 extra point attempts and 25 of 29 field goal attempts in the 2014 season.\n2015 season.\nBailey moved into second place in franchise history with 182 career extra points, passing Mike Clark after making three against the New York Giants in the season opener.\nOn December 7, he made four of four field goals, including a game-winning 54-yard field goal with seconds remaining, to lift the Cowboys to a 19–16 win over the Washington Redskins in Week 13 on \"Monday Night Football\". This performance earned him his second NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award.\nBailey was selected to his first career Pro Bowl in December, after making a career-high 93.8% of his field goal attempts, including being perfect (19-for-19) from 39-yards or closer. After the NFL decided to move back the extra point distance from the two-yard line to the 15-yard line, he responded by making a perfect mark of 25-of-25.\n2016 season.\nIn the 2016 season opener, Bailey made four field goals in the 20–19 loss to the New York Giants. He connected on field goals of 54 and 56-yards. On October 16, he made three field goals against the Green Bay Packers. He recorded his 23rd career game with three or more field goals made, which is the most in team history. On December 18, he kicked six field goals against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, making four and missing two. These misses marked the second occasion of his career that he had missed two attempts in a game; the previous occasion had been in 2011. In the 2016 season, Bailey converted all 16 extra point attempts and 27 of 32 field goal attempts.\n2017 season.\nBailey recorded his 28th career game of three or more made field goals by converting all four attempts in the season-opening 19–3 victory over the New York Giants on \"NBC Sunday Night Football\". The following week, he tied his career long with a 56-yard field goal in a 42–17 loss to the Denver Broncos. Week 3, versus the Arizona Cardinals, marked just the 10th game in Bailey's career in which he did not attempt a field goal. In week 7, he injured his right groin against the San Francisco 49ers.\nHe returned to play on the Thanksgiving game against the Los Angeles Chargers, but would struggle in the following weeks. Against the New York Giants he missed two field goals and one extra point in a 30–10 win. Against the Seattle Seahawks, in a game the Cowboys needed to win to keep their playoff aspirations alive, he made a 51-yard field goal after hitting the left upright and missed two additional field goals, which could have helped the team stay closer in an ultimately season-ending 21–12 loss. In the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, he missed one extra point and one field goal in a 6–0 win.\nBefore his injury, Bailey had been the most accurate kicker in NFL history among players with at least 100 attempts, but fell behind Justin Tucker. He converted 15-of-20 field goals (75%) and 26-of-28 extra point attempts (92.9%) during the season.\n2018 season.\nAlthough Bailey was coming off his worst season, his September 1 release by the Cowboys was nonetheless considered a surprise move, after the team decided to keep Canadian Football League journeyman Brett Maher, who had a solid preseason (including a 57-yard field goal) yet had never kicked in an NFL regular-season game. Bailey had made his only attempt in the preseason (a 35-yard field goal).\nThe team saved $3.4 million against the salary cap with the move. He left the Cowboys as the second-most-accurate kicker in NFL history (88.2%). Bailey also holds the Cowboys' record for most consecutive extra points made (275), most consecutive field goals made (30) and career field goals (186).\nMinnesota Vikings.\n2018 season.\nOn September 17, 2018, the Minnesota Vikings signed Bailey to replace rookie Daniel Carlson, after Carlson missed three field goals in against the Green Bay Packers. Bailey would go on to have another poor season, converting just 21 of 28 field goal attempts (75%), including only 5 of 11 attempts (45.4%) from 40 yards or more – this reduced productivity matched the previous year, as his percentage of overall field goals made was exactly the same.\n2019 season.\nOn March 19, 2019, Bailey re-signed with the Vikings. He struggled during the preseason, forcing the Vikings to trade a fifth round draft choice to the Baltimore Ravens in exchange for kicker Kaare Vedvik. Bailey would end up winning the kicking competition and Vedvik was released on August 31.\nIn Week 5, against the New York Giants, Bailey converted all four field goals and both extra points, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 8, against the Washington Redskins, he made four field goals and an extra point in the 19–9 win en route to another NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award. In Week 15, Bailey converted all four field goal attempts and three of four extra point attempts against the Los Angeles Chargers in the 39–10 victory. He earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for the third time in the 2015 season.\nBailey had a rebound season, re-establishing himself as a notable placekicker, converting 27 of 29 field goals (93.1%), although he had a career-low average in extra points, making 40 of 44 attempts (90.9%).\n2020 season.\nOn March 23, 2020, Bailey re-signed with the Vikings on a three-year, $10 million contract. However, he struggled mightily during the season, going just 15 of 22 on field goals for a career low 68.1%, and just 37 of 43 on extra points for a career low 86%. He was better hitting field goals inside 40 yards, making 9 of 10 (90%). He was released from the Vikings on March 9, 2021."

        "title": "American Football (1999 album)",
        "text": "American Football, also known retrospectively as LP1, is the debut studio album by American Midwest emo band of the same name, released on September 14, 1999, through Polyvinyl. It was recorded shortly after the band released their debut self-titled EP through Polyvinyl in October 1998. The group, consisting of vocalist/guitarist Mike Kinsella, guitarist Steve Holmes, and drummer Steve Lamos, recorded their debut album at Private Studios in Urbana, Illinois, with production from Brendan Gamble.\n\"American Football\" was positively received by critics and US college radio stations, but the band split up soon after its release. The album has since received further critical acclaim and attained cult status and is today considered one of the most important math rock and Midwest emo records of the 1990s. A deluxe edition was released by Polyvinyl in May 2014 shortly after American Football announced their reunion, the demand for which crashed the label's website, and peaked at number 68 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. A month later, a music video was released for the song \"Never Meant\", directed by Chris Strong, who created the cover artwork for \"American Football\".\nBackground.\nFrontman Mike Kinsella previously played in Chicago-based bands Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc alongside his brother Tim. Mike played drums for both bands. In 1997 Kinsella started The One Up Downstairs, whose line-up consisted of Allen Johnson on bass, Steve Lamos on drums, David Johnson on guitar, and Kinsella himself on vocals. The One Up Downstairs recorded three songs that were planned for a 7\" vinyl release by Polyvinyl. However, the band broke up before it was pressed, thus the record was shelved. Shortly afterwards, Lamos was jamming with guitarist Steve Holmes, who was Kinsella's college roommate. Kinsella thought he \"could add something\", resulting in the trio forming American Football. The band got their name from a poster that Lamos' girlfriend had spotted. The poster read, \"Come see American Football, the most overpaid athletes in the world.\"\nThe first time the group met it was \"pretty casual\", and their \"[musical] ideas were noodly and meandering\", according to Kinsella, who \"started putting some notes to them.\" The trio was based in Champaign, Illinois, while Kinsella was attending the University of Illinois. American Football was initially a side project, not intending to become a full-time commitment, as Holmes comments, due to them \"always half-assing things\". The first song the group wrote together was the instrumental \"Five Silent Miles\". At the time they were listening to Steve Reich, attempting to work out interplay between two guitars. The band released a 3-track self-titled EP in October 1998 which included \"Five Silent Miles\".\nComposition and recording.\nKinsella used American Football in an attempt to revive the more rock-oriented sound of Joan of Arc's earlier material. The album is a stripped-back approach to later-day Joan of Arc, resulting in an emocore-sounding album, which also mixed with indie rock and math rock. At the time, Kinsella liked The Cure, The Smiths and \"super sad shit.\" Holmes and Kinsella were also into punk and hardcore music, while Lamos was into jazz. The band concentrated on interaction between the two guitars, basing their timing on musical cues. According to Lamos the song titles were made up a couple of hours \"before we finished the artwork.\" Lamos also mentioned that the band simply referred to the material as \"the B song or the C-sharp song.\" Each song is in a different tuning. Kinsella had a journal that he used lyrics from, though they were written \"from years before that, so it was just like, 'Yeah, that’ll work.'.\" After writing the lyrics and melodies, Kinsella would \"just screech...them out.\" While practicing the material, they didn't have a PA system and thus Holmes and Lamos did not know the lyrics until the group did live performances.\n\"American Football\" was made \"literally in the last four days\" before two-thirds of the band had to move back home, according to Kinsella. The album was recorded in May 1999 at Private Studios in Urbana, Illinois on a TASCAM 85 16B analog tape recorder, and was produced by Brendan Gamble. Gamble previously produced the band's self-titled EP. Not all of the material was in a finished state by the time the band went to record and they agreed to simply \"finish [writing] these songs in the studio and put out the record.\" The group did not have a bass player and decided to thicken the sound by doubling the guitar tracks. In addition to their usual instruments, each member provided further instrumentation: Holmes played the Wurlitzer while Lamos played trumpet, and Kinsella played bass. The album was mastered by Jonathan Pines at Private Studios in July 1999.\nPhotography.\nThe house on the artwork, located on 704 W. High St in Urbana, Illinois, is within walking distance of the University of Illinois. Photography was done by Chris Strong and was designed by Strong and Suraiya Nathani. None of the band members lived in the house; according to Kinsella, \"it was friends of friends\" who lived in the house when they went to college. Joe Goggins, writing for \"The Line of Best Fit\", wrote that \"Like all the best cover shots,\" the photo symbolizes \"the music it prefaces in such an intangible, elusive way\". Also noting that the album \"\"sounds\" like it could only have been made in small-town America,\" and that the cover art \"\"looks\" as if it could only really have been taken in similar surroundings.\" The house became a landmark for emo music fans, who often visit the house to take photos. Music journalist Sean Neumann, who documented the history of the house for \"Vice\", noted that fans have carved markings into the sidewalk in front of the home where Strong took the original photograph. The house would later take a leading position in the band's reunion, and the interior of the house later used for the cover of their eponymous second album. Kinsella revealed that the repeated references to the house was due to the fact it was one of the few images related to the band.\nOn May 5, 2023, American Football revealed that they, Polyvinyl, Chris Strong, Atiba Jefferson and Open House Contemporary had collectively purchased the house, \"in an effort to preserve its place and legacy within the community that built it.\"\nRelease.\n\"American Football\" was released on Polyvinyl Record Co. on September 14, 1999. According to a contemporary in the \"CMJ New Music Report\", the album performed well at college radio stations, perhaps due to Kinsella's musical past. Despite its minor success, the band broke up due to the members no longer living in the same city and their college courses coming to an end. Kinsella has since stated that the band knew when they were recording the album that they were going to break up. Kinsella also said that they \"never had any ambitious goals. [W]e weren't kids who wanted to...tour all summer.\" Kinsella and Holmes both moved to Chicago and remained in contact at first. Meanwhile, Lamos moved to Colorado, later becoming a professor. Kinsella wanted to form a new group where he had full creative control, and formed the Owen project, while Holmes and Lamos later played together with The Geese. In 2004 Kinsella recorded an acoustic version of \"Never Meant\" for a split release between Owen and Rutabega. Also that year, the \"American Football\" album was pressed on vinyl for the first time and released on Polyvinyl.\nIn a 2019 interview with \"Noisey\", Polyvinyl co-founder Matt Lundford described the album's subsequent sales figures and influence in the years following its release as \"a constant climb upwards.\" Lunford recalled that \"American Football\" \"just kept organically being discovered by people, and then inspiring people and inspiring bands, and then being rediscovered.\"\nReissue and touring.\nIn April 2014, American Football announced they were reuniting for live performances. Holmes said the group realised that \"the time was ripe for three middle aged dudes to play some old songs about teenage feelings, and stand around tuning guitars for a long time.\" Polyvinyl released a deluxe edition of two discs containing various demos and live tracks with expanded packaging on May 20. Demand for the re-release had crashed Polyvinyl's website. The reissue came about when Holmes found cassette tapes of demos and showed them to Polyvinyl. Polyvinyl, who first teased a possible release back in 2012, asked if the band wanted to do anything with the tapes. The group were initially unaware of the album's anniversary. One of the live recordings was \"The 7's\"; it was one of the first songs the band ever wrote and was used to close their live performances. The song was \"one of the more interesting things\" the band ever wrote, according to Holmes and showcases the band's interest in different time signatures.\nOn June 5, 2014, a music video was released for \"Never Meant\". Directed by Chris Strong, the video was filmed inside and around the house that features on the album cover artwork. The video was set in Urbana, Illinois, around 1999. Strong revealed that the storyline was \"about a brief relationship occurring between two characters at the end of their college experience\". Strong had other people portray the band. American Football, with the addition of Kinsella's cousin Nate playing bass, played a surprise show in August in Chicago. They then followed this up with playing a festival in September and three nights at New York's Webster Hall. Further dates running into December were also played. In December, a live video was released for \"Never Meant\", filmed in October at New York's Webster Hall. The band played their first ever UK shows in May 2015.\nReception.\n\"American Football\", with the help of word-of-mouth, gained cult status since its release. AllMusic reviewer Fred Thomas stated that \"Every song here manages to sound meticulously constructed without diminishing the easy, often dreamlike feel of the album. The record is defined by a sense of possibility and youthful discovery, and stands out not just as an anomalistic emo-jazz hybrid but as a lasting, iconic statement in the often blurry history of independent music\".\n\"Stereogum\" listed \"Never Meant\" as one of \"30 Essential Songs From The Golden Era Of Emo\" and \"The Summer Ends\" as one of \"30 Essential Post-Rock Songs\". \"NME\" listed the album as one of \"20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test Of Time\". \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the album at No. 6 on their list of the 40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time. \"Never Meant\" was named the greatest emo song of all time by \"Vulture\".\nThe reissue charted at number 68 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, number 5 on the Catalog Albums chart and number 22 on the Tastemaker Albums chart. The reissue was ranked at number 1 on \"Paste\" magazine's \"Five Recent Reissues Worth Owning\" list.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written and composed by American Football.\nPersonnel.\nAdapted from the liner notes.\nAmerican Football\nTechnical personnel"

Beginning in February 2007, the team went 0-20-3 and Fenton was benched, finally returning to the starting position in February 2009 as a senior and helping AIC win.\nOn December 16, 2010, the graduate student, head of hockey game operations and community relations and hockey coach at Manhattanville College, he was signed for one game as an emergency backup goaltender for the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL) after the team's normal backup, Ilya Bryzgalov, became ill and could not play. Fenton was getting a haircut when he received a phone call asking him to suit up; he initially believed the call to be a prank. His assigned uniform number was 35, but he used his old college mask with number 30."

        "title": "Efficiency (basketball)",
        "text": "In professional basketball, the most commonly used statistical benchmark for comparing the overall value of players is called efficiency. It is a composite basketball statistic that is derived from basic individual statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and shot attempts. In theory, efficiency accounts for both a player's offensive contributions (points and assists) and their defensive contributions (steals and blocks), but it is generally thought that efficiency ratings favor offense-oriented players over those who specialize in defense, as defense is difficult to quantify with currently tabulated statistics.\nNBA.\nEFF.\nThe NBA publishes online all of the basic basketball statistics recorded officially by the league. Individual player efficiency is expressed there by a stat referred to as 'efficiency' and abbreviated EFF. It is derived by a simple formula:\nThe formula was created by Kansas City sports reporter and statistician Martin Manley.\nDPR.\nDPR (short for Defensive Player Rating) is a stat that shows the Defensive prowess of a player showing their in game ability and defensive impact to their team by using a per game formula that equates for the amount of time spent on the court and taking into account position competition pace and era as well as other factors. This is the formula:\n( (Player spg+ Player bpg) / team minutes played )-( times blown by * Pace of Players Era ) * Total Average of Possessions + ( Players DRTG * Team Pace ) / Total number of years played\nPER.\nThe most commonly used alternative to the EFF is the player efficiency rating developed by ESPN basketball statistician John Hollinger. It is denoted as PER, and is derived by a very complex calculation designed to compensate for different teams' varying style of play, among other factors. PER scores do not differ markedly from EFF scores, but player rankings will not be the same in both systems.\nA PER of 15 is considered average across the entire league (not true of EFF), and serves as a simple benchmark against which any player may be quickly compared to indicate his approximate net worth to an NBA franchise. Teams intending to compete for the championship typically seek to enlist at least two star players with high efficiency ratings above the low twenties.\nA PER of 30 over a span of more than a few games is considered exceptionally high. According to the modified PER formula used at Basketball-Reference.com, the highest PER ever achieved over an entire single season in the NBA was 32.85 by Nikola Jokić in 2021–22. Wilt Chamberlain held the distinction of being the only player with a PER over 30 over an entire single season for 2½ decades, after having a PER of 31.84 in 1962–63. No other player surpassed 30 until Michael Jordan in 1987–88 with a PER of 31.71. Since then, Jordan repeated the accomplishment three more times, and the milestone has also since been eclipsed by David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal (three times), Tracy McGrady, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James (four times), Anthony Davis (twice), Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo (three times), Nikola Jokić (four times) and Joel Embiid (four times). No PER statistics are available pre-1951–52 as the 'minutes played' statistic was first recorded during that season.\nIn the 2021–22 NBA season, three players achieved this feat : Nikola Jokić (32.85), Giannis Antetokounmpo (32.05) and Joel Embiid (31.16). Jokić broke Chamberlain's record of 32.08, kept for 60 years.\nPlayer efficiency rating NBA records:\nEuroLeague and EuroCup.\nThe EuroLeague, its second-tier level competition, the EuroCup, and several European national domestic leagues, use a different type of formula to determine the ratings and efficiency of players, called the performance index rating (PIR):"

        "text": "Cricket in the Cayman Islands is an established sport. The Cayman Islands playing season runs from January to July. There are 20 cricket clubs in the Cayman Islands.\nHistory.\nBeing a British overseas territory for many centuries, it can be assumed that cricket was played in the early 1800s, as it was in the West Indies. It first became organised in the Cayman Islands from 1940 and was contested between the districts of West Bay and George Town. By the 1970 the game became structured and more organised, starting with 5 teams and the construction of the Smith Road Oval. The rapid growth of the economy of the Cayman Islands saw many expatriates move to the islands, with them came many people from cricketing nations who helped to fuel a growth in the sport on the islands.\nIn 1997, the Cayman Islands were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. In 2000 they made their debut in international cricket in the Americas Cricket Cup, where they finished 4th and gained their first international victory over Argentina. In the same year the Cayman Islands became the first Affiliate to play List A cricket when they took part in the 2000/01 Red Strip Bowl competition. In 2002, they gained Associate membership of the International Cricket Council. By 2005 they were taking part in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, where the Cayman Islands made their debut in first-class cricket against Bermuda and later against Canada. The team lost both matches heavily and has not appeared in first-class cricket since.\nSince then the Cayman Islands have dropped rapidly down the cricketing pyramid of the World Cricket League and will now take part in the 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Five.\nGoverning body.\nCayman Islands Cricket Association is the official governing body of cricket in the Cayman Islands. Its current headquarters is in Grand Cayman. Cayman Islands Cricket Association is the Cayman Islands representative at the International Cricket Council.\nDomestic competitions.\nMen's domestic cricket in the Cayman Islands is split into 2 divisions: Clico Cayman Division 1 and Clico Cayman Division 2. Matches are played in one-day and Twenty20 formats. The islands also have 3 women's cricket clubs.\nDomestic teams.\nListed below are the current 7 most senior men's cricket clubs that make up the Clico Cayman Division 1, the highest level of domestic cricket in the Cayman Islands:\nGrounds.\nThere are currently plans to develop four further cricket grounds in the Cayman Islands. By the end of 2009 a new pavilion had been constructed at the Jimmy Powell Oval.\nNational team.\nThe Cayman Islands national cricket team formed in 2000. They have played at first-class (in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup) List A (in the 2000–01 Red Stripe Bowl), and Twenty20 level (in the Stanford 20/20), as well as in the World Cricket League. A national women's team also exists, but has played only one international tournament (in 2012)."

There are at least 10 cricket clubs and 2 turf pitches in Chile.\nHistory.\nCricket is first recorded as having been played in Chile at Valparaíso in 1829 between the crew of two Royal Navy vessels. The countries oldest cricket club, Valparaíso Cricket Club was formed in 1860 and hosted regular matches throughout the 19th and early 20th century between the clubs of Concepción and the Prince of Wales Country Club. These teams mostly contained British expatriates. In 1893, Chile played its first international match against Argentina, a fixture in which it took the Argentine team 3 days to cross the Andes to reach Santiago to fulfill the fixture. The exodus of British expatriates in the post war years led to a rapid decline in the sport in Chile.\nFrom the 1960s onward, the game was just about kept alive by the few expatriates that remained.\nIn 2001, Chile were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. They made their debut in an ICC event in the 2006 Americas Championship Division Three.

        "title": "County Cricket Council",
        "text": "The County Cricket Council was a short lived body intended to regulate county cricket in England. It existed from 1887 to 1890.\nThe council was the brain-child of Lord Harris. In November 1886 he had sent a letter to the County Secretaries asking the question as to whether the existing two year qualification rule should be reduced to one year. Under this rule players who changed counties generally had to serve a two-year residence qualification in their new county during which they were unable to play inter-county matches for either county. The proposal was defeated at the annual Secretary's meeting in December 1886, but at the same meeting it was agreed that a committee be set up to consider the rules of county cricket generally. At a meeting in July 1887, at which the report of the committee was considered, it was agreed that a County Cricket Council be formed. It was further agreed that the existing committee frame the by-laws of the new Council.\nThe first meeting on the council was on 5 December 1887 at which Lord Harris was elected chairman. Nothing specific was agreed at this meeting but at a further meeting on 8 February 1888 a change to the hours of play was agreed, as was a proposal regarding a change in the lbw law. Since the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) decided the laws this was no more than a suggestion. A proposal abolishing boundaries in favour of all hits run out was defeated.\nAt the December 1888 meeting a number of proposals relating to the qualification rules were considered but were not carried.\nAt the December 1889 meeting a proposal by Durham regarding the classification of the counties and a system of promotion and relegation was considered. A committee was set up to consider the issues. The committee proposed three tiers of counties; the existing 8 first class counties, 8 second-class counties and a further 8 third-class counties. It proposed a system of promotion and relegation involving the bottom team of one division playing the top team in the lower division. They would play each other home and away in the following season, the results determining whether the two changed places. Any change would take place in the following season, promotion would therefore take two years.\nThese proposals were considered at the fourth annual meeting of the Council in December 1890. They were not well received. Eventually a vote was taken on whether The Cricket Council itself should be suspended sine die. The motion was passed on the casting vote of the chairman, Mr M.J. Ellison, and The Cricket Council effectively ceased to exist. \"This utterly unexpected result fairly took those present by surprise, and they dispersed hurriedly - a most undignified ending to what we are compelled to describe as a most unbusinesslike meeting.\"\nOn the following day, 9 December 1890, the county secretaries met to decide the fixtures for 1891. Since the council had collapsed and no proposal had been passed the counties arranged their fixtures on the old basis of arranging \"home and home\" matches against whichever counties they wished. \"The most noticeable feature ... is the encouragement given to Somersetshire by the chief county clubs. Middlesex played the western shire last summer, but Kent, Surrey, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Lancashire will next summer test the merits of the eleven, which showed such good all round cricket, under Mr. H.T. Hewett's command, last year.\" By arranging these 12 matches against first-class counties Somerset became a de facto first-class county without any proposal or vote to that effect."

        "text": "Between 1993 and 2020 professional darts had two rival bodies which staged tournaments and had separate pools of players, the British Darts Organisation (BDO) and the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Both staged its own world championship. In practice, players had to choose which organisation to represent, but many switched between the two, which often caused controversy. \nThis situation arose following an acrimonious split in the early 1990s between the leading players and the BDO. Darts had boomed in popularity during the 1980s, with as many as 23 televised events in 1983. However, by the end of the decade this had fallen to just one. This, combined with general disillusionment at the BDO's management of the sport, prompted 16 top players to break away and form their own body. Four years of legal action followed, culminating in the 1997 Tomlin order, which confirmed the existence of both bodies, and established that players were free choose which one to play for.\nThis list documents the players who made the decision to switch from one organisation to the other. In general more players switched from the BDO to the PDC than vice versa, attracted by the greater prize money and better competition offered by the PDC. The BDO folded in 2020, but many of their events were subsequently revived by the World Darts Federation, so the split in darts remains.\nWorld Darts Council foundation.\nThe sixteen darts defectors who formed the WDC were as follows:\nSince then, many darts players have left the BDO to join the PDC, although some players rejoined the BDO either from finding it difficult on the PDC circuit or lack of sponsorship. The PDC had new talent of their own. However some players left them to join the BDO."

The game's title refers to the \"hand of God\" goal scored by Diego Maradona against England at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nGameplay.\nWhile the game is ostensibly a football simulation video game, it differs from other football games in that the player only ever controls the goalkeeper: instead of playing a full match, the player is presented with a number of preset scenarios (such as a standard attack, or a set piece like a corner kick or penalty kick) where the player is expected to save the shot on goal - to do this, the player can move freely within the six yard box, and jump or dive sideways. Once the shot is saved - or the goal is conceded - the play stops and the game goes on to the next scenario.\nThe game features three game modes centered around the core mechanic: \nThe player must pick one of sixteen teams of the Football League First Division, although no player names or team colours are featured.\nThe Commodore 64 version has some extra sound effects and some limited digitized speech.\nReception.\nAllGame gave the game a score of 2.5/5 stars. Writing for Zzap!64, Julian Rignall judged the game as \"vastly overpriced and not really worth buying\", noting that while the core gameplay was fun, the repetitive nature didn't provide enough replay value."

        "title": "Meigle Cricket Club",
        "text": "Meigle Cricket Club is a cricket club in Meigle, Perthshire, Scotland.\nEstablished in 1876, it has won the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union, of which it was a founder member in 1929, on eight occasions 2022, 2019, 2014, 2001, 1998, 1980, 1961 and 1954. The club was second to Brechin in the inaugural season.\nThe 1st XI played in the Cricket Scotland Eastern Premier League in 2021 and the club 2nd and 3rd XI play in the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union lower divisions. The Union is one of three regional feeder leagues to the Cricket Scotland League set up. The club has long running rivalry with Freuchie Cricket Club from Fife from many years competing in the Scottish section of the National Village Cup which the club has won ten times, the first year of the Village Cup in 1972 and the most recent success was 2022 in a 5 wicket win over Falkland to make it three titles in a row. From the mid nineties to the late noughties the club were deemed ineligible for the competition. Meigle became eligible again in 2011 and in 2013 lost the Scottish final to Dumfries-shire side Kirkwood.\nThe club play at Victory Park which has a slight slope, though the other park in the Village, Belmont Park has also hosted cricket in the past. In 2001 the club, captained by Peter J. Drummond who later captained Forfarshire in the Scottish National Cricket League, played in the annual Play-Off to enter the Scottish National Cricket League but lost to Border League champions Penicuik. The 1st XI has also won the main Twenty20 cup for the North District, the Three Counties Cup (originally Forfarshire, Perthshire &amp; Aberdeenshire) on six occasions 1951, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1998 and 2000 and have been runners up nine times, the last final appearance being in 2018\nThe 2001 undefeated league winning team are known as 'the invincibles', but the greatest team in the club's history is regarded by many to be the 1980 treble winning team. A short lived league cup 'The 3 D Sports Premier Trophy' was played for in 1999 and Meigle reached the final, but suffered a batting collapse and lost out to Gordonians at Guthrie Park, Brechin. Meigle had won their section with 100% record in a group with Dundee HSFP, Brechin and Cupar (Fife). The club have played in the Scottish Cup in six seasons, often qualifying by winning the Strathmore Union, or finishing in a high position.\nThe Meigle 2nd XI has won a 2nd XI title on five occasions; 1932, 1958, 1959, 1984 and 2018. The 2nd XI has won the Two Counties Cup on three occasions 1985, 1987 and 2000. The Strathmore Union allowed the Perthshire League to join it in 2004.\nThe club's greatest ever player is WB Scott, better known as Bill Scott. In 1997, in a match versus Arbroath United he became the first batsman to amass 10,000 league runs. He is also often referred to as 'the best amateur batsman never to have played for Scotland', he finished with over 13,000 runs in the Union top flight.\nRepresentative honours.\nThe village has produced three full Scotland men's internationals: Gordon Drummond, J.R. (Ralph) Laing and JGB (Gordon) Laing. Ralph was also president of the Scottish Cricket Union, now rebranded as Cricket Scotland, in 1992. Gordon Drummond was captain of Scotland from mid 2009 to early 2013. Ryan Watson, a former club professional in the late 1990s, has also played and captained Scotland after qualifying through residency in 2002 as he is originally from Harare and was raised in South Africa. Two of the successful 2001 team also played representative cricket. Peter J Drummond played for Scotland U19 in 1998 as well as for East Coast Crusaders regional team, as it was called at that time and Iain M Stewart played for Scottish Universities in 2004 whilst playing for another club. Many players have represented the Strathmore Union select XI and its successor the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Union select XI such as Sandy Reid, JR Laing, Alan Pattullo, Nicol Whitelaw and Bill Scott (Senior)in the 1960s. Peter CJ Drummond and Bill Scott (Junior) in the 1980s and Denis Christie, Gordon Drummond, Peter J Drummond, Iain M Stewart, Callum Leese and Alasdair Gilmour appeared for the XI at various points from the 1998 through to 2012. Alan Neave and Matthew Farmer represented the select in 2015.\n Neil Kirk, while a Northern CC and Perthshire CCC player, represented Scotland U16, before becoming a productive run scorer at the top of the order for Meigle. Tom Duff played for the British Army and Scotland U17 in his younger days, before becoming a main stay of the Meigle middle order.\nFreddie Cox played for Scotland U15 in 2008, touring South Africa and playing in the U15 ICC Europe Championship. Cox scored his first career century for Scotland U15 in South Africa in 2008. Another revered Meigle player was Brian Reid. Brian was a highly skilled wicket keeper and handy batsman who played for Meigle in the 50's and 60's. His talents took him down south where he represented Sussex in seasons 1960 and 1961. \nJamie Morrison played for the Scottish Students in a twenty20 match in June 2012, the national student representative team that was formerly called Scottish Universities up until the end of 2011.\nThe club has also produced one full women's international cap player, Annette Drummond."

He previously played nine games in the Czech Extraliga with HC České Budějovice before coming to North America to play two WHL seasons with the Chilliwack Bruins. He was selected by the New York Rangers in the fifth round, 127th overall, of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, and joined the Calgary Flames organization via trade in 2011. In 2014, he was traded by the Flames for a brief stint with the Edmonton Oilers.\nPlaying career.\nHorák began his professional career with his hometown team HC České Budějovice of the Czech Extraliga, appearing in one game with the club in 2007–08 and eight more in 2008–09. He was selected by the New York Rangers in the fifth round, 127th overall, at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Additionally, Horák was selected by the Western Hockey League's (WHL) Chilliwack Bruins with the eighth overall pick in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) import draft. Though he had little knowledge of English, Horák moved to Canada to join the Bruins for the 2009–10 WHL season.\nIn his first season in Chilliwack, Horák scored 21 goals and 47 points. He improved to 26 goals and 78 points in 2010–11. Additionally, he represented the Czech Republic at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he had one goal and one assist in six games. He returned to the team for the 2011 tournament, recording one assist in five games in that tournament.\nHorák signed a contract with the New York Rangers on May 6, 2011. However, before he played a game with the NHL team, he was traded to the Calgary Flames on June 1, along with two draft picks, in exchange for defenceman Tim Erixon. The Flames discovered Horák while scouting his teammate, and their own draft pick, Ryan Howse. The team realized that Howse, a 50-goal scorer in 2010–11, had become far less effective when Horák suffered an injury.\nInitially expected to join the Flames' minor league affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), to begin the 2011–12 season, Horák exceeded the team's expectations and earned a spot with the Flames. He made his NHL debut and scored his first point, an assist, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 8, 2011. He scored his first NHL goal on October 26 against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Colorado Avalanche.\nOn November 8, 2013, Horák was traded to the Edmonton Oilers alongside goaltender prospect Laurent Brossoit in exchange for Ladislav Šmíd and minor league goalie Olivier Roy. He was subsequently reassigned by the Oilers to their AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons.\nWith his NHL rights still owned by the Oilers, Horák opted to return to Europe in signing a one-year contract with Russian club Vityaz Podolsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on May 12, 2014.\nHorák played two seasons in the Swedish Hockey League with the Växjö Lakers before opting to return to his native Czech Republic as a free agent. On 13 May 2020, he secured a one-year contract with HC Sparta Praha of the ELH, in which he had not played since the 2008–09 season.\nPersonal life.\nHis father, Roman Horák, also played hockey in European elite leagues for 14 seasons."

White. the 1891 league members were the Albany Senators, Buffalo Bisons, Lebanon Cedars, New Haven Nutmegs, Providence Clamdiggers, Rochester Hop Bitters, Syracuse Stars and Troy Trojans.\nIn 1909, the Eastern Association played for eleven days before folding under league president Jim Paige. The 1909 league comprised Amsterdam, Gloversville, Johnstown, Kingston Colonials, Middletown Orange Blossoms, Newburgh Colts, Poughkeepsie Students and Schenectady.\nThe 1913 Eastern Association was an eight-team league that featured the Bridgeport Crossmen, Hartford Senators, Holyoke Papermakers, Meriden Hopes, New Haven White Wings, New London Planters, Pittsfield Electrics, Springfield Ponies and Waterbury Contenders. The league president was Baseball Hall of Fame member Jim O'Rourke. The Holyoke Papermakers moved to Meriden on July 11, 1913.\nIn their final season of play, the 1914 Eastern Association was an eight-team league, as Jim O'Rourke continued as president. The 1914 Eastern Association comprised the Bridgeport Crossmen, Hartford Senators, New Britain Sinks, New Haven White Wings, New London Planters, Pittsfield Electrics, Springfield Ponies and Waterbury Contenders.\nStandings &amp; statistics.\n1891 Eastern Association.\nschedule\n Providence disbanded August 13; New Haven disbanded August 14; Syracuse &amp; Rochester disbanded August 25.\n1909 Eastern Association.\n Poughkeepsie and Schenectady disbanded June 1The league folded after eleven days on June 6.\n1913 Eastern Association.\nschedule\n Holyoke (24–52) moved to Meriden July 11.\n1914 Eastern Association.\nschedule"

        "title": "Cycle Messenger World Championships",
        "text": "The Cycle Messenger World Championships, or CMWCs, are an annual urban cycling competition whereby cycle messengers and cycling enthusiasts showcase their skills in an array of events, many of which simulate everyday tasks for a cycle messenger. Each year, the CMWCs are held in a different city around the world, with each host city designing its own unique course. The highlight of the CMWCs is the main race in which cyclists are given manifests and must pickup and deliver items to various locations around the host city as quickly and efficiently as possible. The total number of pickups and deliveries, or \"drop offs\" is unknown to the messengers before the race, but has been known to reach up to 100 stops and usually takes between 3–4 hours to complete. The cyclist who completes all of the assigned deliveries in the least amount of time wins the race. In addition to the main race there are also several side events which have become increasingly popular over the past few years. These events change yearly depending on the discretion of the host city but usually include backward circles, bike polo, bunnyhop, cargo race, longest skid, sprints, and trackstand.\nHistory.\nThe idea for the \"Cycle Messenger World Championships\", or \"Cycle Messenger Championships\" (CMCs) as it was initially called, was first conceived in 1992 by Achim Beier and his assistant, Stefan Klessman. Both worked for \"messenger\" Berlin, a Berlin-based messenger service, and were inspired to have a gathering of the world's bicycle messengers after talking with co-worker and ex-Washington D.C. bicycle messenger Michael \"Ozone\" Odom. Beier then took a trip to New York City where he visited Washington Square Park and talked with local bicycle messengers including James \"The General\" Moore about the proposed idea. The idea was received well by the local messengers and thus Beier and Klessman began planning the logistics of the first Cycle Messenger Championships.\nSince no competition of this type had ever taken place, there were many challenges to overcome before the first CMC be completed. Most notably, the host city, Berlin, needed to approve the proposal of such an event. This, in itself, was an enormous task since many streets had to be shut down for an entire weekend, the duration of the event, including \"Straße des 17. Juni\", the main thoroughfare for East-West traffic through Berlin, and the area around Brandenburg Gate. In the end, the city of Berlin approved the event with only minor changes to Beier's requests and in 1993 the first Cycle Messenger Championships took place. In all, around 500 messengers participated in the inaugural event.\nThough the 1993 CMC was declared a success, it lost a substantial amount of money. As a result, Beier and Klessman decided to transfer ownership of the event to a sports marketing company which had expressed interest in organizing it. Beier and Klessman stayed with the project, acting as consultants, to ensure that the competition retained its authenticity.\nThe marketing company, though based in Berlin, had a partner in London and thus it was decided that the 1994 CMWC would be located there. Unfortunately though, months before the scheduled date of the CMWC the marketing company pulled its sponsorship of the event and left Beier and Klessman alone on the project.\nAfter much deliberation, it was decided that the 1994 CMWC would still take place in London, though now it would be organized solely by cycle messengers. Against all odds, the event took place and attracted around 500 participants. Once again, the CMWC was deemed a success.\nWith the sting of the marketing company's withdrawal still fresh, several cycle messengers at the 1994 event decided to form a committee dedicated to the successful realization of the CMWC. Largely self-appointed and without any real power the committee floundered. The need for such an organization, however, was being realized by more and more cyclists.\nThe 1995 CMWC took place in Toronto, and in 1996 it was hosted in San Francisco. It was here that the \"International Federation of Bike Messengers Association\", or IFBMA, was created for the purpose of guaranteeing that the CMWC would take place each year. This committee, unlike the previous one, was open to all who wished to attend and thus had the potential of being a legitimate organization.\nCycle Messenger World Championships.\nSince the inception of the IFBMA the CMWCs have taken place each year in different locations around the world. The following is a list of host cities along with the year they hosted the CMWCs and the champions from each year. \nCategories.\nFrom the very first CMWC, the main race had two gender categories that participants could compete in, Men and Women.\nAt the 2017 championship in Montreal, the name of the women's category was changed to the more inclusive \"WTNB\", which meant that the category was open to women, trans people, and non-binary people. \nThe year after, at the 2018 championship in Riga, the WTNB category was again renamed to WTF while the men's category was renamed \"Open\" allowing people of any gender to compete in this category. \nAt the same championship, thanks to the work of the Star Bike Messenger Association (formerly the Women's Bike Messenger Association), official guidelines about gender categories at CMWC's were voted in as an amendment to the IFBMA by-laws. This meant that all future CMWC's must have two categories named Open and WTNB.\nIn 2022 at the championship in New York City the organizers chose to divide the WTNB category into two separate categories named \"WT\", which was open for women and trans people and \"NB\", which was only open for non-binary people.\nEvents.\nMain Race.\nThe main race is designed to simulate the normal workday of a cycle messenger. At the start of the race, depending on what format is used, each messenger is given a manifest or a number of packages with the location of pick-ups and drop-offs of packages throughout the closed course. The course is composed of numbered or named checkpoints spread throughout a closed course which has been anywhere from a few kilometers to 10 kilometers or more in total track distance. Participants usually must traverse the length &amp; breadth of the course many times to complete the event. The messengers seek to quickly and efficiently plan their routes in order to pick up and deliver each package in a timely manner. Several different systems have been used, most of these involve manifests, some involve multiple manifests. The total number of manifests and deliveries is unknown to the messengers before the start of the race but has been known to reach as high as 100 pick-ups and drop-offs. The field of cyclists is narrowed down after each manifest in some forms of this event but in others no elimination process is used and results are tallied for the entire field. The event usually takes between 3 and 4 hours to complete.\nCargo Race.\nThis side event requires cyclists to transport oversized objects from one point to another. Typical objects chosen for delivery range from beer kegs to boxes. Hay bales, pallets and lengths of lumber are also used in the challenge. Cyclists are encouraged to come up with creative ways of transporting such irregularly shaped objects while still using a bicycle. Many competitors prefer to use panniers and trailers, while some even use specially designed bicycles for the event.\nSprints.\nThe sprints are a shorter distance race, usually ranging from 200–300 meters in length, on a closed course with the cyclist crossing the finish line first declared the winner. Elimination rounds are utilized to determine the winner, usually 5-10 participants race each heat.\nTrack stand.\nThe track stand competition is an event in which cyclists try to maintain a stationary position for as long as possible while on a bicycle. All cyclists start off with both hands and feet on the bike in the traditional trackstand position. As the competition progresses, cyclists are instructed to remove specific limbs from the bicycle. The order which cyclists remove their limbs from the bicycle usually starts with taking off one hand, then both hands, one foot, then both feet. The cyclist who remains balanced in an upright and stationary position the longest is declared the winner.\nSkids.\nThis competition consists of cyclists attempting to create the longest skid. Quite possibly one of the most dangerous events other than the main race, competitors sprint toward a starting line then lock up their back wheel to initiate the skid. Competitors must then balance themselves over their handlebars to create as little friction as possible between the rear stationary wheel and the ground while still steering their bicycle. Each cyclist is given two attempts to skid as far as possible. The record for the longest skid at the CMWC is set around 500 feet. It is not necessary to actually leave a \"skid mark\" and competitors are allowed to move their pedals slightly as well as to cause the rear wheel to leave the ground while trying to pivot their weight forward in order to decease friction between the road surface and rear wheel. An Exhibition event, this skill has no application in the actual function of a bicycle messenger.\nBackward Circles.\nLike the Skids, this event has no correlation in simulating the ordinary workday of a cycle messenger. This competition requires cyclists to pedal backwards in consistent and consecutive circles. The cyclist who can complete the most consecutive backward circles is declared the winner.\nBunny hop.\nThis event has been described as the high jump of cycling. Designed to simulate the need for avoiding obstacles during a messenger's workday, contestants must use their bikes to jump over a bar of increasing height. Contestants unable to clear the bar after two attempts at a particular height are eliminated from the competition. The last contestant remaining is declared the winner. The current CMWC record for this event is 1.27 meters set by Marlon Prather at the 1998 CMWC in Washington D.C., USA. Since the late 1990s a notable rise in popularity of the fixed gear bicycle has caused this event to decline as few participants are able to bunnyhop their fixed gear bicycles over any object of much more than 10 to 20 centimeters.\nBike polo.\nHardcourt bike polo follows the same general guidelines as hockey only this event is played using bikes. This event has no direct correlation to any particular bicycle messenger skill beyond bike control but was introduced for the 2003 CMWC in Seattle as an exhibition event. 2008 CMWC in Toronto saw the sport officially introduced as a number of bicycle messengers enjoy playing the game. Bicycle messengers are credited for much of the games hype and expansion around the globe. The 2008 tournament drew over 100 participants on 35 teams and lasted throughout entirety of the event. It was the first large and international bike polo tourney in history, presented as the first ever \"World Bike Polo Championships.\" Only a portion of the participants were bicycle messengers, the rest were polo players drawn to the tournament for its potential size due to its sponsorship by the CMWC 2008. The tournament's results were not included as CMWC results. Teams consisting of three cyclists used mallets to pass a ball and score as many goals as possible. Teams usually compete on a concrete court of varying sizes.\nLa Ocho.\nThis event is not considered a portion of the CMWC but was attempted on one occasion at a CMWC event in Guatemala, but the event was never realized.\nThis figure-8 track was designed by architect Dieter Janssen especially for the 2010 CMWC at Panajachel, Guatemala. The 200 meter course consisted of an Euler spiral loop built from rammed-earth with banked curves and a heavy timber over-under bridge intersection in the middle. The geometry was idealized for a 65 km/h speed, though its range could support a minimum of 12.8 km/h and a maximum of 140.9 km/h based on an average rider's weight, the expected frictional force and a maximum inclination angle of 45 degrees. \nUnfortunately, the track was destroyed by rain before the event took place. The race was held on level ground with no bridge. Lines drawn on the surface indicated where the track might have been. In construction it never resembled the design provided by the architect, heavy timber abandoned for 4x4 &amp; 2x4 stud frame construction. Banked turns were never achieved.\nReception.\nThe CMWCs have been well received by the local populations of several host cities while others consider the event a nuisance. For instance, the 2007 CMWCs in Dublin, Ireland, were pushed to the outer limits of the city after the local population protested the event. On the other hand, the 2002 CMWCs held in Copenhagen, Denmark, were welcomed by the city and competitors were even treated to a free breakfast and free beer courtesy of the mayor."

The New Zealand national rugby league team drew the series 1.5-1.5 against Great Britain and also defeated Wales and France.\nBackground.\nThis was the Kiwis first tour of Great Britain since the 2000 World Cup, the Kangaroos having toured Great Britain the previous year.\nThe original squad named in September included Nathan Cayless, Craig Smith and Tevita Vaikona who all later had to withdraw from the final squad.\nBefore the tour started the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, held an official reception for the team at the Beehive. It was the first New Zealand rugby league tour to receive an official farewell from a Prime Minister in Parliament.\nThe tour was opened against Hull F.C. at The Boulevard, the same ground had hosted the first Test matched played by the 1907 New Zealand team. This match was the last international played at the ground, while the 1907 team had played in the first.\nMotu Tony broke his hand in the match against England A and was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Steve Clark refereed all three Test matches against Great Britain.\nFormer Kiwis player Sean Hoppe, who had not represented his country since 1999, was given the honour of captaining St Helens R.F.C. in a tour match against the Kiwis. The match was meant to be his last before retirement however he was later called into the touring squad due to injuries and his final two matches were test matches against Great Britain and France. Hoppe was called up over Lesley Vainikolo who was also considered as a replacement after injuries to several backs including Motu Tony and Clinton Toopi.\nIn the end Great Britain tied the series, taking the inaugural Baskerville Shield as hosts. The third test match was Great Britain's first win over New Zealand since 1993.\nSquad.\nKiwis captain Nathan Cayless withdrew due to suspension and was replaced by Andrew Lomu while Willie Talau required surgery and was unavailable. After the Australia Test both Lomu and Matt Utai were withdrawn by their clubs for off-season surgery. On arriving in England, English based players Craig Smith and Tevita Vaikona were ruled out due to injury. Later Motu Tony and Robbie Paul were sidelined with injuries and in France Richard Swain left to sign a deal with the Broncos and Stephen Kearney flew home due to a family illness.\nClinton Toopi broke his hand in a scuffle with Nigel Vagana during a team drinking session after the second test. Freeman and team management initially tried to cover up the incident, claiming the injury occurred during the match, before media found out and had a field day.\nFixtures.\nThe New Zealand side played five test matches while on their European tour and one test in New Zealand before leaving.\nBaskerville Shield.\nAfter 30 New Zealand vs England / Great Britain test series since 1907, the Baskerville Shield was inaugurated for series between New Zealand and England / Great Britain. The shield is named in honour of Albert Henry Baskerville who organised New Zealand's first ever tour of Great Britain in 1907.\nVenues.\nThe three Baskerville Shield tests took place at the following venues.\n1st Test.\nHenry Fa'afili scored three tries in the 30–16 first test win over Great Britain at Ewood Park, the first Kiwis hat-trick against the Lions in 97 matches dating back to 1907. His tries all came in the second half as the Kiwis rallied from a 10–6 halftime deficit to win comfortably.\nAftermath.\nNew Zealand halfback Stacey Jones won the George Smith Medal as player of the series against Great Britain.\nThe tour was Freeman's last as head coach. In 2003 Daniel Anderson was named as the new Kiwis coach."

Swimming is one of five aquatic disciplines at the championships.\nQualifying criteria.\nIn January 2010, the FINA Bureau approved the swimming qualification system for the 2011 World Aquatics Championships. This represented the first time that a qualification system (including time standards) was used for the swimming portion of the world championships. Times had to be swum at a FINA approved competition/meet between March 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011. The qualification meets included continental championships in 2010 and 2011 (e.g. European Championships, Asian Games, Pan American Games); and international competitions approved by FINA in advance. All meets for the qualification were swam in 50 meters course.\nThe qualifying system for individual events was similar to what is employed for the Olympics. Historically, there has been a limit of 2 swimmers per country per individual event, and one relay team per country per relay event. This limitation remains; however, if a country wished to have more than one male and one female swimmer in up to 2 events each, then an athlete(s) had to meet one of two standards:\nEvents.\nThe swimming competition featured races in a long course (50 m) pool in 40 events (20 for males, 20 for females; 17 individual events and 3 relays for each gender).\nThe evening session schedule for the 2011 World Aquatics Championships is shown below.\nNote: prelims/semifinals/finals will be swum in events 200 m and shorter; prelims/finals in events 400 m or longer. For prelims/semifinals/finals events, prelims and semis will be held on the same day, with finals being the evening of the following day. For the 400 m events and the 800 m relays, prelims and finals are the same day. For the individual 800 m and 1500 m races, prelims are in the morning of one day, with finals in the evening of the next day. Preliminary sessions began at 9:00 a.m.; finals at 6:00 p.m.\nWorld records.\nThe following world records were established during the competition:"

        "text": "The 2010–11 Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team represented the University of Colorado in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Head coach Tad Boyle was in his first season at Colorado. The Buffaloes competed in the Big 12 Conference and played their home games at the Coors Events Center. This was the Buffaloes' last season in the Big 12, as they moved to the Pac-12 Conference in 2011–12.\nPreseason.\nThe Buffaloes are in their final season in the Big 12, as they will be moving to the Pac-12 in 2011–12. They finished the previous season with a record of 15–16 and 6–10 in Big 12 Conference play. Of those 16 losses, seven were by six points or less. Additionally, all five starters return from that team.\nIn the Big 12 preseason coaches' poll, the Buffaloes were picked to finish ninth. Cory Higgins was named the Preseason All-Conference First Team, while Alec Burks was an honorable mention. Both were also named to the 50-man preseason Wooden Award watchlist. Additionally, Burks was on the 50-man preseason Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist. Gary Parrish picked them eighth in the Big 12, and said that he \"won't be shocked if they ride the Higgins-Burks tandem into the top half of the league and make the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2003.\" Jason King of Rivals.com named the Buffaloes the sixth-best team in conference, adding, \"Don't be surprised if long-suffering Colorado sneaks into the NCAA tournament.\"\n2010–11 Schedule and results.\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| 2011 Big 12 men's basketball tournament\n!colspan=9| 2011 NIT\nSeason.\nPreconference season.\nThe Buffaloes defeated in-state rivals Colorado State 93–80 in overtime, behind Alec Burks' 25 points.

This was the Buffaloes' first win over a top ten team since defeating No. 3 Texas in 2003. Cory Higgins had 18 points and a career-tying 10 rebounds. The Buffaloes had a 12-point halftime lead and never let Missouri get closer than seven in the second half.\nPost-season.\nThe Buffs were selected as the No. 1 seed for the 2011 NIT Tournament."

        "text": "The Alabama Crimson Tide golf teams represent the University of Alabama located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Crimson Tide currently has two of the best teams in the country with the men and women consistently ranked inside the top 5 by \"Golfweek\".\nHistory.\nMen.\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide men's golf program has a rich history that dates back to the program's inception in 1952. That first season saw Crimson Tide golfer Bobby Hill capture the SEC Individual Championship. Michael Thompson (2008), Justin Thomas (2012), and Bobby Wyatt are the only other Crimson Tide golfers to win the SEC Individual Championship. The Crimson Tide have won five SEC Tournament Championships (1979, 2008, 2012–2014); appeared in 27 NCAA Tournaments and advanced to the finals 12 times; and have had 13 players garner 21 All-America honors.\nJay Seawell, the 2008 &amp; 2012 SEC Coach of the Year, arrived in 2002 and has steadily taken the Tide to some of its greatest heights in program history. Entering his 21st year at the Capstone, Seawell has established Alabama as one of the elite programs in collegiate golf. The Tide has been routinely ranked in the top 15 in the country while leading Alabama to 15 NCAA Tournaments appearances and four berths in the NCAA Championships. Under Seawell's guidance in 2008, Alabama captured its first SEC Championship since 1979 and its first SEC medalist – Michael Thompson – since Bobby Hill in 1952. Over the past eight years, the Crimson Tide has garnered seven All-America honors by five players, had eight All-Region selections and 15 All-SEC honors, including 9 first-team choices. Bud Cauley, an All-American his three years at Alabama (2009–2011), was named the SEC Freshman of the Year in 2009 and was a finalist for the Ben Hogan Award. Thompson was also a finalist in 2008. In 2011, Cory Whitsett was named SEC Freshman of the Year and First-Team All-SEC. The 2012 team made it to the final match at the NCAA Championships before losing on the final hole and finishing second. Freshman Justin Thomas was also named the SEC Freshman of the Year and the SEC Player of the Year for the 2012 season. In 2013 the team repeated as SEC Champions and for the second straight season made it to the final match at the NCAA Championships, where they defeated Illinois 4-1 to win the program's first NCAA National Championship. In 2014 the Tide once again won the SEC Championship, with Bobby Wyatt becoming just the fourth Crimson Tide golfer to win a SEC Individual Championship. The Tide would go on compete in their third consecutive NCAA finals match and repeated as NCAA national champions by defeating Oklahoma State 4–1.\nWomen.\nAlabama first had a women's golf team in 1974, but has reached heights of success over the past five years never seen in the program's history. Since his arrival in 2006, Mic Potter has built Alabama into a national contender. The Tide has advanced to the NCAA Championships in each of Potter's eight seasons after the Tide had qualified for the NCAA Women's Golf Championship just once in the program's history before his arrival. In 2010, Alabama won the SEC Women's Golf Championship and posted a then school-best third-place finish at the NCAA Championships. In 2011, the Crimson Tide won its first NCAA Regional title in school history, and qualified for the 2011 NCAA Golf Championship at the Traditions Club in Bryan, Texas, where they finished tied for 8th.\nIn 2012, the Tide won their first-ever NCAA Championship, when senior Brooke Pancake made a par on the final hole to clinch the title, winning with a score of 1,171 strokes (19-over-par) over four rounds at the Vanderbilt Legends Course in Franklin, Tennessee. The championship was the first for the University of Alabama in a sport other than football or gymnastics. The Crimson Tide continued their success in 2013 where they won the SEC Championship as a team while Stephanie Meadow won the individual title.\nIn 1941, Eleanor Dudley won the women's individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS) — which later evolved into the current NCAA women's golf championship). In 2015, Emma Talley won the NCAA Individual Championship.\nTour professionals.\nMen.\nThe Crimson Tide has had numerous great players that have come through the program over the years. One of the best known is Jerry Pate, who has competed in the Walker Cup, garnered All-American honors, captured the U.S. Amateur, won the U.S. Open, was named PGA Rookie of the Year, and went on to enjoy a successful career on the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour. Pate also designed Alabama's current home course, Ol' Colony. Another successful alum is 2017 PGA Championship winner, 2017 FedEx Cup Champion, 2021 Players Championship winner, and 2022 PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas. As of July 2023, Thomas has won 15 times on the PGA Tour. Besides his 2 Major Championships, FedEx Cup, and Players Championship, other highlights include the 2018 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, the Dell Technologies Championship (a FedEx Cup playoff event), and the 2020 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational.\nOther players that played with the Tide include Trey Mullinax, Steve Lowery, Bud Cauley, Spike McRoy, Jason Bohn, Dicky Pride, David Kirkpatrick, Mårten Olander, Michael Thompson, Davis Riley, and Lee Hodges. Olander captured the 1993 Ben Hogan Award. Besides Jerry Pate, the only other Alabama Crimson Tide golfer thought to earn first team All-America honors is David Kirkpatrick.\nWomen.\nCheyenne Knight has the lone victory for former Tide players on the LPGA Tour. Other LPGA Tour players include Kathleen Ekey, Sofia Grönberg-Whitmore (who won three times on the Ladies European Tour), Camilla Lennarth (one LET win), Stephanie Meadow, Brooke Pancake, Leslie Spalding, and Emma Talley. The Tide has some success on the LPGA developmental Epson Tour, with 13 all-time members and four total wins.\nOl' Colony Golf Complex.\nThe Crimson Tide golf team's home course is Ol' Colony, located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The course, which opened in 2000, was designed by former Crimson Tide golfer Jerry Pate. The course is a 7,544-yard par 72, which includes the state-of-the-art Jerry Pate Practice Center dedicated to the Crimson Tide golf teams."

He became a Southern Baptist minister.\nEarly life.\nMann was born in Carthage, Mississippi, to parents Annie Mann Gray and Jim Banks, Jr. and was a very active member in his Baptist church while growing up. Mann attended South Leake High School where he was noted for both his athletic and academic abilities – he graduated as his class's salutatorian and was named a top five basketball player in the state of Mississippi.\nBasketball career.\nCommunity college.\nMann was awarded a scholarship to play basketball at East Central Community College. During his two-year career he averaged approximately 21 points and 12 rebounds per game. Mann then signed a full athletic scholarship to play his remaining two seasons of NCAA eligibility at Mississippi Valley State University.\nLater in life, Mann would also get inducted into ECCC's Academic and Athletic Halls of Fame.\nMississippi Valley State.\nDuring the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons, Mann's two at MVSU, he appeared in 56 total games while averaging 19.3 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. During his senior season he guided the Delta Devils to a school record 22–7 record, a share of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) regular season title, the SWAC Tournament championship and MVSU's third-ever berth into the NCAA Division I Tournament. He averaged 21.7 points and 13.6 rebounds per game that season, and his rebounding ability was good enough to lead Division I. Mann was also named the SWAC Player of the Year and was the first player from MVSU to earn that honor.\nLater life.\nIn June 1996, one month after graduating \"magna cum laude\", the Golden State Warriors selected him as the 11th pick in the second round (40th overall) in the NBA draft. Between the NBA Draft and the first days of the Warriors' training camp, Mann's desire to play basketball faded away. He felt that he had a higher calling in life, which was working with children as a Baptist minister. On October 31, the day before the Warriors were set to open their season against the Los Angeles Clippers, Mann told the organization that he did not want to play professional basketball and that it would be unfair to both himself and the team to keep going.\nGolden State released him, and Mann was no longer an NBA player. He sacrificed, minimally, the $220,000 rookie salary along with the glamour of an NBA lifestyle to pursue his calling."

He most recently played for Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He played five seasons in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) for the Hannover Scorpions and Hamburg Freezers between 2009 and 2014 before moving over to North America. Internationally, Wolf has represented Germany at both the junior and senior levels.\nPlaying career.\nWolf's first full season of professional hockey was the 2007–08 season. He appeared in 46 games for ETC Crimmitschau in the 2nd Bundesliga, the second level of German hockey. Following a 9-point season, Wolf returned to ETC Crimmitschau for the 2008–09 season, where he scored 8 points and recorded 120 penalty minutes in 36 games. Wolf was a member of the German national junior team at the 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He scored one goal in the tournament against Canada, and recorded 53 penalty minutes in six games.\nIn 2009–10, Wolf moved up to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) and joined the Hannover Scorpions. He played two seasons with Hannover before moving to the Hamburg Freezers in 2011. He earned a place on Hamburg's top line and enjoyed a dramatic increase in his offensive production; Wolf scored 35 points in 46 games in 2011–12 after recording only 6 in 51 games the year before. He also led the DEL with 167 penalty minutes. The National Hockey League's (NHL) Toronto Maple Leafs offered Wolf a try-out at their 2012 summer camp but he failed to stick with the team.\nWolf returned to Hamburg for the 2012–13 season, scoring a career-high 17 goals and adding 19 assists. He improved to 40 points the following season and again led the DEL in penalties with 152 minutes. Wolf also played with the German national team in that country's failed attempt to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Following the 2013–14 DEL season, Wolf left Germany intending to try to make the NHL. He signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Calgary Flames. The Flames assigned him to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Adirondack Flames to begin the 2014–15 season. He scored 12 goals and added nine assists in his first 35 games with Adirondack before earning his first recall to Calgary on 26 Jan. 2015. Wolf made his NHL debut on 31 Jan., a 4–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers. He suffered a laceration to this thigh during the game and missed the next three games due to the injury.\nWolf turned down offers to remain in North America and returned to Germany for the 2015-16 season, again signing with the Hamburg Freezers. Following the 2015-16 campaign, he was traded to fellow DEL side Adler Mannheim in exchange for Martin Buchwieser. Wolf signed a seven-year deal with the Adler organization.\nPersonal life.\nWolf is a second-generation hockey player. His father, Manfred, was born in Canada but played professionally in Germany and twice represented West Germany at the Winter Olympics."

Two fixtures were played that season. The first was against Middlesex which turned out to be an easy win for Surrey. However, their confidence was put into check when they were soundly beaten by Yorkshire. Another match with Middlesex was played at Old Deer Park on 6 December 1880 with the result of each fifteen scoring one goal, in what was described as a ″splendidly-contested game″.\nCounty side.\nHonours.\nCounty Championship finals (2 wins);\nCounty Championship Shield finals (4 wins);\nCounty Championship Plate finals (1 win);\nNotable players for the County side.\nMany notable players have represented Surrey.

        "text": "Ian Williams (born August 31, 1989) is a former American football nose tackle of the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He played college football at Notre Dame.\nEarly years.\nWilliams grew up in Altamonte Springs, Florida, and attended Lyman High School, where he played football for coach Bill Caughell. In his junior year, Ian was responsible for 83 tackles, 23 tackles for loss (TFL), 12 hurries, 4 forced fumbles, 2 sacks, 4 fumble recoveries and 4 passes broken up, as the Greyhounds won their third straight 5A district title and beat Melbourne High School (Melbourne, Florida) for Lyman’s first Florida playoff win in school history. Williams continued his dominance from the defensive tackle position in 2006, recording over 40 tackles, 18 TFL, and 12 sacks. He was recognized as the 120th rated prep player nationally on ESPN 150's listing and 30th on the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" list of top 50 Florida prospects.\nWilliams was heavily recruited, receiving scholarship offers from Notre Dame as well as most of the top southern programs in the country, including by Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Before her death in 1995, Ian's maternal grandmother, Lily May Green, had told Ian's mother Natalie Williams that her grandson would one day play for the University of Notre Dame. Not wanting to influence his decision, Natalie waited until after Ian signed with Notre Dame to tell her son of his grandmother's prescient forecast.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nRecruited to play nose tackle in then-defensive coordinator Corwin Brown's 3–4 system, Williams played in all 12 games his freshman year, starting two. He totaled 45 tackles, 19 solo stops, 1.5 TFL on the year and was named a Freshman All-American. His 45 tackles were the third most for any freshman defensive lineman in Notre Dame history. He ranked sixth on the team in tackles and was the only player ranked in the top 12 in tackles on the team who did not start at least four games.\nSophomore year.\nWilliams appeared in all 13 games for the Irish, making 7 starts. He had 40 total tackles including 2 TFL, in addition to a pass break up. Williams anchored the defense against Pittsburgh amassing 6 tackles and 2 TFL. He recorded 7 tackles against Navy, 8 against Syracuse, and 3 tackles and a pass break up against the USC Trojans.\nJunior year.\nThe Irish made a switch to the 4-3 defense under Jon Tenuta. Williams shifted from a 3–4 nose tackle to a 4–3 defensive tackle. Williams played in all 12 games, starting 8. He recorded 39 tackles, 6 TFL, a pass breakup and his first career interception.\nSenior year.\nNew Irish defensive coordinator, Bob Diaco, switched the defense back to a 3–4 scheme. Williams thrived in a return to his natural position at nose tackle, anchoring the middle of the Irish defensive front and recording 37 tackles, 2 sacks and an interception in 7.5 games. Williams suffered an MCL sprain against Navy on October 23, 2010. The injury did not require surgery, but it did force Williams to miss the last four games of his senior season. Prior to the injury, he was one of only two players to appear in every game of his four-year Notre Dame career (Kerry Neal is the other). Williams returned to practice in early December healthy enough to play for Notre Dame in the Hyundai Sun Bowl against the Miami Hurricanes on December 31, 2010.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nWilliams was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent following the 2011 NFL Draft on July 25, 2011.\nOn March 11, 2013, Williams signed a two-year contract extension with the 49ers.\nOn September 15, 2013, Williams broke his left ankle in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was subsequently placed on injured reserve, effectively ending his season.\nOn September 9, 2015, Williams was named a defensive team captain by head coach Jim Tomsula.\nWilliams originally signed a five-year $27.5 million contract with the 49ers on March 9, 2016. However, on March 21, 2016, the deal was reduced to one–year, $3 million after Williams failed his physical following ankle surgery.\nOn October 27, 2016, Williams was released with an injury settlement."

The team plays its home games at Bush Field in New Haven, Connecticut. The Bulldogs are coached by Brian Hamm.\nHistory.\nThe Yale Bulldogs Baseball program was founded in 1868 as a team to compete with Harvard baseball. Yale played its first baseball game on September 30, 1865 against Wesleyan College; Yale won 30 to 12. On July 23, 1868, Yale played its first championship game as an invitational against Harvard University, in which it lost 25–17. On June 5, 1869, Harvard visited Brooklyn and defeated Yale 41–24. Harvard would continue to dominate Yale in the Ivy League baseball conference, but Yale won two games in 1874.\nIn 1928, Yale Field was built to house the Yale baseball program. Yale's first game in their new stadium was played in 1928 against the Eastern League New Haven Professionals. The first pitch was thrown by Mayor Tower of New Haven. The result of the game was a 12–0 shutout by the road team.\nMajor leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow (Oakland A's and Boston Red Sox) and catcher Ryan Lavarnway (Boston Red Sox/Los Angeles Dodgers), among others, played baseball for the Bulldogs. Breslow led the Ivy League with a 2.56 ERA in 2002. Lavarnway led the NCAA in batting average (.467) and slugging percentage (.873) in 2007, set the Ivy League hitting-streak record (25), and through 2010 held the Ivy League record in career home runs (33). In August 2012, Breslow and Lavarnway, playing for the Red Sox, became the first Yale grads to be Major League teammates since 1949, and the first All-Yale battery in the major leagues since 1883. In September 2016 the two were again battery-mates, this time playing for Team Israel in the qualifiers for the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\nMajor League Baseball.\nBob Davis pitched for Yale and then pitched in Major League Baseball in 1958 and 1960. Yale has had 35 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965."

Some notable games included the first round game between Miami and Virginia. The Cavaliers held a 10-point lead with 42 seconds left, but the Hurricanes scored 10 straight points at the end of regulation to send the game to overtime, where Miami eventually won. In the quarterfinal game between Florida State and Virginia Tech, the Hokies' Erick Green hit a shot to put Virginia Tech up 1 with 4.7 seconds left. Derwin Kitchen then hit what appeared to be the game-winning shot for the Seminoles, but the shot was waved off after review, and Virginia Tech advanced.\nFor the first time in 10 years, Duke and North Carolina played each other in the championship game. The top-seeded Tar Heels had come back from double-digit deficits in their victories against Miami and Clemson. Duke started strong as well, scoring the first 8 points and taking a 14-point lead at halftime. However, Duke did not relinquish their lead in the second half, as North Carolina never got closer than 9. Duke won, 75-58, to give the Blue Devils their 19th ACC championship, the most in ACC history. This title also tied Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski with former UNC coach Dean Smith for the most ACC championships, each having won 13.\nTicket policy.\nThe ACC implemented a new ticket policy in hopes to sell out more of the Greensboro Coliseum's approximately 23,000 seats. In previous years, each school was allotted an equal number of ticket books for distribution. This left large numbers of tickets unsold as some schools, such as Boston College, Miami, and Florida State, do not have large numbers of fans who make the trip to Greensboro for the tournament. In response, the ACC issued more ticket books to schools who traditionally sold the majority of their ticket books.\nSeeding.\nTeams are seeded based on the final regular season standings, with ties broken under an ACC policy.\nAwards and honors.\nTournament MVP&lt;br&gt;\nNolan Smith, Duke\nAll-Tournament Team\nFirst Team&lt;br&gt;\nNolan Smith, Duke&lt;br&gt;\nKyle Singler, Duke&lt;br&gt;\nHarrison Barnes, North Carolina&lt;br&gt;\nTyler Zeller, North Carolina&lt;br&gt;\nDemontez Stitt, Clemson\nSecond Team&lt;br&gt;\nMiles Plumlee, Duke&lt;br&gt;\nSeth Curry, Duke&lt;br&gt;\nJohn Henson, North Carolina&lt;br&gt;\nKendall Marshall, North Carolina&lt;br&gt;\nMalcolm Delaney, Virginia Tech"

        "text": "Glyn Davies (24 August 1927 – 7 November 1976) was a Welsh international rugby union fly-half who played club rugby for a large selection of clubs but most notably for Pontypridd and Cambridge University. He won eleven international caps for Wales including a win over the touring 1947 Australia team. Described as a mercurial outside half, Davies was notable for his sidestep and ability to change pace and direction with ease.\nHe was the brother-in-law of Welsh opera singer Sir Geraint Evans.\nRugby career.\nDavies first played rugby as a schoolboy for Pontypridd Grammar School. After the end of the Second World War, while still a schoolboy he represented a Welsh team in two Victory internationals. Davies played his early club rugby for local team Cilfynydd RFC and sporadically he played for other more notable teams, playing his first game of four for Cardiff in the 1945/46 season. He joined Pontypridd where his natural ability was polished by endless training sessions under the tutorship of groundsman Dick Coates. It was while with Pontypridd that Davies was first called to the Wales national squad. His first cap was against Scotland in the 1947 Five Nations Championship, partnered at fly half with Haydn Tanner. Wales were comfortable winners, but the next game Davies was replaced by Billy Cleaver and Davies failed to be reselected for the rest of the campaign. In December 1947 Davies was chosen for his second Welsh international game, a 6–0 victory over the touring Australian team, this time partnered with Handel Greville.\nWhen Davies matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge he gained a place in the Cambridge University rugby team, and won three 'Blues' by playing in the Varsity matches between 1948 and 1950. 1948 also saw Davies play the entirety of the Five Nations Championship, linking again with Tanner in all four matches. During the 1948/49 season Davies was selected to play for touring invitational team the Barbarians. 1949 saw Davies play in three of the Five Nations Championship matches, yet again in partnership with Tanner. The 1949 encounter against England is recognisied as one of his finest displays. During the match, he took advantage of Tanner's trade mark long passes to cut through the English defence to set up two tries for Les Williams. Davies was replaced by Cleaver in the Ireland encounter of 1949, and the next season the Welsh selectors decided to adopt Cleaver and Rex Willis at the half back positions.\nAlthough not selected for Wales in 1950, Davies was made captain of the Cambridge University team that season, and led the team to a win over Oxford University at that year's Varsity Match. Neither team showed much quality in their play, though it is reported that Davies' 'erratic brilliance' was seldom offered full scope by his partner or his forwards.\nIn 1951, Davies played eleven games for Newport, entering the team as a short term replacement for regular Newport fly-half Roy Burnett, who was forced to withdraw from the team after an injury. 1951 was also the final year of Davies' international career. Called into the Wales squad for the two opening matches of the 1951 Five Nations Championship, and partnered by Willis, he was replaced by Cliff Morgan and never represented Wales again. In the 1950s Davies turned out for Clifton and Bristol and played county rugby for Gloucestershire.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Dolly Vardens was a recurring name used for a number of baseball teams throughout the United States in the early decades of baseball (1860s-1880s). Most were white, male squads, though there was an all-female, African-American team from Chester PA, assembled by barber-turned-sports entrepreneur John Lang in the 1880s.\nAccording to 19th century reports, in May 1883 in Chester's Lamokin Woods, a team of Black female players led by shortstop Ella Harris played\nagainst an unnamed team in a contest that was considered \"a failure.\"\nApparently, there were two different semi-professional Dolly Varden teams, and one of them played a third club known as \"Captain Jinks\" in a game declared a draw after 15 innings. A newspaper report of the game included a long description about the opening coin toss plus a \"lengthy discussion about a player getting a thorn stuck in her foot after chasing a foul ball into the woods, but not a ton of attention was paid to the quality of play.\"\nOverall, these teams of Black women players were considered to be only a novelty, rather than a competitive organization, who played for the entertainment of spectators. (MLB official historian John Thorn notes, \"Lang’s Dolly Vardens, created in the 1880s, are sometimes confused with several Philadelphia-area all-male clubs bearing that name as early as 1867.\")\nThe name was taken from a character in the 1841 novel \"Barnaby Rudge\", by Charles Dickens. Dolly Varden is also the name of a Hell's Kitchen, NYC restaurant as well as the moniker of the last passenger train locomotive to run up Manhattan's West Side."

The Finnish Ice Hockey Association organizes both the national women's program and the three levels of domestic women's leagues in Finland.\nHistory.\nThe first women's hockey teams were founded in Finland in the early 1970s but it took many years for women's ice hockey to gain enough popularity and participation to warrant the creation of a national league. In 1978, the first \"lipstick tournament\" was held, creating an informal national women's championship, though records of the competition outcomes are not available.\nIn 1982 the Naisten SM-sarja was founded as the first elite women's national league in Finland. The first season was played in two divisions of five teams each (10 teams total) and the first playoffs were held in Tampere on March 12 and 13, 1983. Since its founding, the number of teams per season has ranged from 8 to 13. In 2017, the Naisten SM-sarja was renamed Naisten Liiga and in 2018 the number of teams was expanded to the league's original number of 10.\nThe Finland women's national team entered international competition in the 1988-1989 season, quickly claiming its first gold at the 1989 IIHF European Women Championships. The team has remained successful since its emergence on the international stage, medalling in three Olympics and 13 Women's World Championships. Most recently, Finland took silver at the 2019 Women's World Championship after a controversial loss in the finals to the United States.\nDevelopmental leagues.\nThe number of young women in the junior level increased slowly, from 500 players at the beginning to approximately 2000 today. The growth rate was not satisfactory, so the Finnish Ice Hockey Association decided to invest in development of women's ice hockey by supporting leagues. The number of teams considerably increased: there are now 12 teams in the Women's 1st Division, is Naisten Mestis (second level after the Naisten Liiga).\nTournaments.\nThe following IIHF tournaments were hosted in Finland."

        "title": "David Shaw (American football)",
        "text": "David Lorenzo Shaw (born July 31, 1972) is an American football coach. He served as head coach of the Stanford Cardinal football team from 2011 to 2022. Shaw was the team's offensive coordinator for the entire tenure of his predecessor, head coach Jim Harbaugh, from 2007 to 2010. Previously, Shaw was a four-year letter winner as a wide receiver for the Cardinal from 1991 to 1994, where he was coached by Dennis Green and Bill Walsh. Prior to returning to Stanford as offensive coordinator, Shaw was Harbaugh's passing game coordinator at the University of San Diego and an assistant coach in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders, and Baltimore Ravens. Shaw resigned as the Stanford head coach on November 27, 2022.\nEarly life and playing career.\nShaw was born in San Diego, California and moved with his family around the country following his father Willie's career as an NFL coach. Shaw played high school football at Rochester Adams High School in Rochester Hills, Michigan while his father coached for the Detroit Lions.\nIn 1989, Willie accepted a coaching job at Stanford University and the family moved back to the Bay Area where David ultimately graduated from James Logan High School in Union City, California.\nHe went on to attend Stanford University, where he played college football as a wide receiver under head coaches Dennis Green and Bill Walsh. In his college career from 1991 to 1994, Shaw caught 57 passes for 664 yards and five touchdowns. Shaw was also on the Stanford men's basketball and track teams before earning a B.A. in sociology in 1995.\nNFL assistant coach.\nHis coaching career began at Western Washington University in 1995. In 1997, Shaw began a nine-year run as an NFL assistant coach with stints for the Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders, and Baltimore Ravens.\nAs the Raiders' quality control from 1998 to 2000 and quarterbacks coach in 2001, the team won two consecutive AFC West titles and completed a 10–6 regular season.\nShaw was the quarterbacks coach for the Baltimore Ravens from 2002 to 2004 and wide receivers coach for the Ravens from 2002 to 2005, with the 2003 team finishing with a 10–6 regular season mark and winning the AFC North. In 2005, Shaw coached wide receivers Derrick Mason to a Ravens record of 86 receptions and 1,073 receiving yards (the third-highest Baltimore record) and Mark Clayton to a Ravens rookie record of 44 receptions for 471 yards.\nCollege assistant coach.\nIn 2006, Shaw left the NFL for the University of San Diego to join head coach Jim Harbaugh's staff as passing game coordinator. The 11–1 Toreros' offense led the NCAA Division I-AA in many statistical categories, including passing offense (293.3 ypg), total offense (494.25 ypg), and scoring offense (42.83 ppg).\nWhen Harbaugh was hired as head coach of Shaw's alma mater, Stanford, in 2007, he brought Shaw as offensive coordinator. During his years as an assistant coach, Shaw also coached the Cardinal wide receivers and running backs.\nShaw's unit performed successfully during his years as coordinator, led by 2010 Heisman Trophy runner-up Andrew Luck. They scored at least 40 points in 11 different games with Shaw as offensive coordinator, including 10 times in the 2009 and 2010 seasons. The Cardinal achieved a school-record 461 points in 2009 and broke the record again the following season with 524 points.\nDespite the graduation of 2009 Heisman Trophy runner-up Toby Gerhart, during Stanford's 2010 season when Shaw took over as running backs coach, the Cardinal running game was second in the conference and 17th in the nation with an average of 213.77 yards and a total of 2,779 yards, Stanford's second-highest rushing total ever.\nStanford head coach.\nIn January 2011, Shaw was promoted to head coach after Harbaugh left to become head coach of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers over numerous other offers, including a hefty salary with the Miami Dolphins. Shaw is the first Stanford alumnus to serve as head football coach since Paul Wiggin, who coached Stanford from 1980 to 1983.\nIn his first three seasons, Shaw led the team to three consecutive BCS bowl games, including two Rose Bowls. Shaw led the team to a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin. The team returned to the Rose Bowl again the following year in the 2013 season, but lost a heart-breaker to Michigan State.\nAfter a rebuilding season in 2014, the 2015 season saw Shaw lead Stanford to its third Pac-12 championship in four years, and consequently, its third Rose Bowl in four years, which the team won 45–16 over the Iowa Hawkeyes. With the 2015 conference title, Shaw became the first Stanford coach in 80 years to win three conference titles and only the third ever in program history (after Tiny Thornhill from 1933 to 1935 and Pop Warner in 1924, 1926, and 1927). With the Rose Bowl victory over Iowa, Shaw became only the second Stanford coach to win two Rose Bowls (after John Ralston who won the 1971 and 1972 Rose Bowls). That victory also resulted in Stanford being ranked #3 in the final Coaches Poll, their highest final ranking in the history of that poll. They were similarly ranked #3 in the final AP Poll, their highest final ranking in 75 years, following the 1940 national championship season.\nWith a win over Cal in the 2017 Big Game at Stanford Stadium, Shaw set a new Stanford record for most wins by a football head coach (72 wins), breaking the record previously held by Pop Warner (71 wins from 1924 to 1932). After going undefeated in the Big Game in Shaw's first eight seasons, Stanford lost the 2019, 2021 and 2022 Big Games at Stanford Stadium to bring Shaw's record to 9–3 against Cal.\nAfter two consecutive 3–9 seasons, Shaw resigned as head coach, effective immediately, on November 27, 2022, just over an hour after Stanford's last game of the 2022 season.\nPersonal life.\nShaw and his wife, Kori, have three children.\nHis father, Willie, was a Stanford assistant coach under Jack Christiansen from 1974 to 1976 and Dennis Green from 1989 to 1991, and an NFL assistant coach with the Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers, and St. Louis Rams. Willie Shaw was a finalist for Stanford's head football coach position in 1992 that eventually went to Bill Walsh."

        "title": "List of outdoor ice hockey games",
        "text": "Playing hockey games outdoors—in soccer, football and baseball stadiums—is an increasingly popular trend for junior, college, professional and international competitions in the 21st century. The popularity of outdoor games has resulted in attendance records in several leagues, and the current world record total of 104,173 was set at The Big Chill at the Big House, a December 2010 National Collegiate Athletic Association game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.\nWhile other indoor sports such as basketball have been able to use outdoor tennis courts and even aircraft carriers for outdoor games, this is rarely possible in ice hockey because a regulation rink is generally much wider and longer than the playing surface available in either of those venues. Ice hockey, however, has been played at Stade Roland Garros, the venue of the French Open in tennis. Staging a Vysshaya liga game on the Russian aircraft carrier \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" has been considered as well. To compensate for the varying weather conditions at outdoor ice hockey games, the teams may switch sides after each half of a period.\nHistory.\nIn the early history of hockey, games were played outdoors on rivers, lakes, and other naturally occurring ice surfaces. The first indoor game, held in 1875, was a novelty at the time, and after that the game moved inside. While the first Olympic hockey tournament, held in 1920, was played indoors, games at the first Winter Olympics in 1924 were the first of several such tournaments to be played outdoors. Games at the World Championships were occasionally played outdoors, including the 1957 gold medal game between the Soviet Union and Sweden at the Lenin Stadium in Moscow. The attendance at that game was approximately 55,000, a number that stood as a record for more than 40 years. In 1954, the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL) played an exhibition game on an outdoor ice surface against the inmates of Michigan's Marquette Branch Prison.\nWhile the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings played an NHL exhibition game in 1991 outside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the modern trend for outdoor competition began in 2001. That year, Michigan State University and the University of Michigan played to a 3–3 tie in an outdoor game known as the Cold War before 74,554 fans. The game was held at Michigan State's Spartan Stadium, with the hockey rink set up in the middle of the football field.\nThe NHL's first regular season outdoor game ensued: the 2003 Heritage Classic, hosted by the Edmonton Oilers, who lost by a 4–3 score to the Montreal Canadiens. Though the game was played in frigid temperatures that went as low as , it drew over 57,000 fans and was hailed as a success. The league followed it up in 2008 when it inaugurated the NHL Winter Classic as an annual event to be held on New Year's Day. The 2008 NHL Winter Classic, held in Buffalo, set an NHL attendance record of 71,217. The 2014 NHL Winter Classic, held at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, set a new NHL attendance record of 105,491. In 2011, for the first time the NHL hosted two outdoor games, the Winter Classic in Pittsburgh, and the Heritage Classic in Calgary.\nOutdoor games have been held by many leagues around the world. The Swiss league's SCL Tigers hosted SC Bern in an outdoor game to celebrate the 100th Tigers–Bern Derby in 2007. In 2009, Swedish clubs Frölunda HC and Färjestads BK played a game at Ullevi. The game broke the former European league-game record for attendance at that time with a crowd of 31,144 (beaten in February 2011 when Jokerit and HIFK played in front of 36,644 spectators). The game also broke the Swedish record crowd of 23,192, set in the same stadium in 1962. The current world record for attendance at a hockey game was set in December 2010, in an NCAA game between the same two teams that participated in the Cold War. In this game, Michigan hosted Michigan State in an event known as The Big Chill at the Big House. The game had an announced attendance of 113,411 spectators, but \"Guinness World Records\" certified the attendance as 104,173 based on tickets scanned. The record had previously been set at the opening game of the 2010 IIHF World Championship, in which the hosting Germans defeated the United States 2–1 before a then-record 77,803 fans. Although the game was held at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, it was not technically an outdoor game, as the stadium's retractable roof was closed due to International Ice Hockey Federation regulations. In 2010, Färjestad and Frölunda again played an outdoor game against each other, this time in Karlstad. 15,274 spectators saw Färjestad win the game 5–2.\nPopularity.\nOutdoor games have proven to be immensely popular with fans. For the 2003 Heritage Classic, the NHL received over 900,000 requests from all over the world for a chance to buy one of the 57,167 tickets available. CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada\" telecast of the game drew 2.7 million viewers, a record for a regular season game for the half-century old television program. In the United States, the Winter Classics have been a ratings winner; 4.56 million people watched the 2011 Winter Classic, and the game led to a ratings win for NBC in the coveted 18–49 age group despite the fact that poor weather forced the NHL to move the start time of the game back several hours on less than a day's notice. It became the most watched NHL regular season game in the last 36 years. The games have been credited as causing increased interest in hockey in the United States. In Russia, the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) hosted its first All-Star Game in 2009 in Moscow's Red Square. The league used the location to promote the KHL amidst the global financial crisis.\nGames.\n\"Though games have been held outdoors since the sport's earliest days, this list contains only those held since the 2001 Cold War popularized the trend of holding outdoor games as events.\""

        "text": "The Ligue de Baseball Majeur du Québec (LBMQ) is a senior (over 21) amateur baseball league in the Canadian province of Quebec. It is the highest level of non-professional baseball in the province of Quebec.\nHistory.\nThe league is the result of the 2002 amalgamation of several men's senior elite level baseball teams in the province of Quebec. The league from Montreal, the \"Ligue de Baseball Senior de Montréal\", merged with those of the Quebec City and Trois-Rivières areas. There were originally ten teams, five from the Montreal area, four from Quebec City and one from Trois-Rivières. A year later, the senior-level league teams from the Estrie and Bas-Saint-Laurent leagues joined bringing the total up to 15. In 2009, the league became the sole senior elite baseball league in Quebec when the \"Ligue de Baseball Senior Majeur du Québec\" folded, and its four teams joined the LBEQ.\nIn 2004, the LBSEQ became the first in Quebec to use wooden baseball bats exclusively. Other competitive levels of play in Quebec have since followed suit (senior, junior and midget).\nIn its seven years of existence, the LBSEQ has represented Quebec in the Baseball Canada Senior Men's Championship each year and has earned four medals. These were a bronze in 2002, a gold in 2003, a bronze in 2004 and a silver in 2008.\nThe LBSEQ a well traveled league has also participated in various tournaments outside of Quebec. In 2008, they played in the 4 Nations Cup in Liège against professional teams from Belgium and England. In 2009, the LBSEQ participated in a tournament in Rouen, France hosted by the local team the Huskies, along with teams from Germany, the USA and the French national team. In 2008, the league participated in and won the Vintage Base Ball World Series in Massachusetts. It competed against the Intercounty Baseball League of Ontario in the 2010 New Era All-Star Classic.\nIn 2013, with the league's growing caliber and reputation, the league's leaders made the decision to rename it the Ligue de baseball majeur du Québec (LBMQ)."

A total of 665 athletes representing 30 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 27 events across 8 disciplines during the Games.\nThe Olympic program was adjusted from that of the 1956 Winter Olympics omitting bobsleigh and adding a sport new to Olympic competition, biathlon. The sport of military patrol, similar to biathlon, had previously been a medal sport in 1924 and a demonstration sport in 1928, 1936 and 1948. The removal of bobsleigh from the Olympic program was by necessity; the site for the 1960 Games lacked a bobsleigh track and the funds were not available to build one. Despite only five nations confirming their intention to take part, the removal of the event from the program garnered international criticism. Both men and women competed at the 1960 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and speed skating.\nA total of 131 athletes won medals at the 1960 Games. The Soviet Union was awarded the most medals, with its athletes winning seven gold medals, five silver, and nine bronze, for a total of 21 medals overall. The United States placed second in medal count, with a total of 10 medals, and Germany placed third, with eight medals overall. Of the 30 NOCs competing in the 1960 Games, 14 won at least one medal, with 10 of these winning at least one gold medal. There was an unofficial bronze medal awarded to Theron Bailie, USA, for the development of the digital clock used for the first time in downhill skiing.\nThe Scandinavian countries attained considerable success in cross-country skiing, with the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish teams winning 12 of the available 18 medals and the remaining six medals being won by the Soviet Union. Finnish cross-country skier Veikko Hakulinen won the most medals, with three – bronze from the men's 15 kilometres event, silver from the men's 50 kilometres event, and gold from the men's 4 × 10 kilometres relay.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals during the 1960 Winter Olympics are listed below."

A total of 1,095 athletes representing 36 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Games in 34 events across 10 disciplines.\nThe Olympic program was adjusted from that of the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics with the return of bobsleigh and luge after the sports had been skipped due to the lack of facilities for them in Squaw Valley. Unlike the preceding Games, a demonstration sport, ice stock sport, was incorporated into the 1964 Olympic program. This was the second and most recent occasion on which this sport (a German variant of curling), had been played as a demonstration sport at the Winter Olympics; the first appearance was at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Both men and women participated in the 1964 Games, with twelve women's events incorporated into the program.\nThe Soviet Union won the most medals; its athletes collected a total of 25, 11 of which were gold. Norway placed second, with 15 medals, and host nation Austria placed third, with 12 medals. Of the 36 competing NOCs, 14 won at least one medal, with 11 of these winning at least one gold. The 1964 Games were marred by the deaths of two competitors during training – the British luge competitor Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and the Australian alpine skier Ross Milne.\nThe Scandinavian nations Sweden, Norway and Finland, as well as the Soviet Union, repeated their dominance of the 1960 cross-country skiing medal tally in 1964 – together, they won all of the medals attainable for this sport. Similarly, Germany had great success at the luge competition, with the United Team of Germany winning five of the available nine medals. Two participants representing Great Britain placed first in the two-man bobsleigh event, earning that nation its first Winter Olympics gold medal in 12 years. Lidiya Skoblikova, a speed skater representing the Soviet Union, earned the most medals at the 1964 Games, winning gold in all four of the women's events in her sport. This achievement made Skoblikova the first Winter Olympian to win four individual gold medals in one edition of the Games.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals during the 1964 Winter Olympics are listed below."

It fields a representative side that competes in the Army Navy Match, although a side representing the Royal Navy predates the formation of the union by at least twenty-eight years. The RNRU also has had a number of international players within its representative squads in all forms of the game. In 2011 the RNRU produced its first women's international as well as providing the captain of England VIIs.\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of service-based clubs existed but found it hard to gain support from service players, because it was considered necessary to turn out for civilian clubs to get first-class games. However, in 1902 the United Services Recreation Ground began to give financial support to the United Services Portsmouth Rugby Football Club to stimulate interest. The club quickly began performing strongly and gained an excellent reputation and equally strong fixture list. The appeal that had been sent out to all naval players to support Service clubs had worked and a definite movement had been made to induce all officers in the Navy to give up playing for civilian clubs. In November 1907 the press were invited to a luncheon where the formation of the Royal Navy Rugby Union was announced Upon formation the Royal Navy Rugby Union contained many players of international standard. In his book Rugby Football (and how to play it) WJA Davies makes reference to the same point made by Marshall and Tosswill and also makes reference to the formation of the Royal Navy Rugby Union in 1906 however, this chapter contains a number of inaccuracies and it is believed by many that WJA Davies chose the date from the season when the first capped Army Navy match was played, 1906/07. This may have been the source of subsequent confusion as the Royal Navy Rugby Union continued to advertise their formation as 1906 and there were a number of anniversary events over the years, particularly in 2006 when they celebrated their 'centenary' which included a match against the Barbarians FC. A second cause of confusion may have been that the match in February 1907 was a capped game but these caps were awarded retrospectively by the Royal Navy Rugby Union following a meeting held by the Royal Navy Rugby Union in August 1910. In 2006 a project was undertaken to investigate the History of Navy Rugby and this project uncovered the original minutes as well as various press reports detailing the formation of the Union. The project also had access to private correspondence from the time. In March 2018 the RNRU Executive Committee acknowledged that the evidence pointed to a formation date of November 1907 but decided that despite this they would still use 1906 \nThe highlight of the RNRU season is the annual Army Navy Match held at Twickenham. The first of these matches took place in 1878 at the Kennington Oval, but it was not until 1907 that the match became an annual fixture as part of the Inter-Service Competition. In 1919, an Inter-Service Championship was arranged by the Army Rugby Union, which included Service teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as a Royal Air Force Rugby Union team and a British Army team playing under the name 'Mother Country'. The Mother Country and New Zealand Army reached the final at Twickenham, with New Zealand winning the encounter to lift the King's Cup. In 1920 the Army Navy competition was expanded to include the Royal Air Force.\nAside from the Army-Navy match and the Inter Service Championship the various Navy Representative teams (1st XV, U23, Women and Veterans) play in a number of competitions during the season in both the fifteen and seven aside games. There are three knockout cups run exclusively for the ships of the Fleet (this sentence is no longer valid as the ships no longer play for the max, midi or mini ships cups. These cup competitions were stopped in the early '90s ) and in the middle of December there is the final of the RNRU Knockout Cup, open to all Establishments, Ships and Royal Marine Units. The Inverdale Trophy (formerly the Blakeney Cup) is named after a past Life Member of the Royal Navy Rugby Union Surg Capt Inverdale RN. It is competed for annually by the five Commands of the Fleet Air Arm, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Royal Marines and Scotland. The competition has enjoyed many formats and is currently competed for over a week for the right to be called RNRU Command Champions and the opportunity to represent the RNRU at an overseas tournament.\nThe RNRU is a Constituent Body of the Rugby Football Union and in honouring its role in the evolution of the game in England it has as a mission statement: \"To promote, develop, administer and finance rugby football in the Royal Navy throughout the world in support of the Rugby Football Union\". This is achieved by financing coaching seminars and courses; administrating the game, and officiating the games through the provision of referees and touch judges.\nSenior XV Cup Competitions.\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union Senior XV players annually for five cups as well as playing in the triennial Commonwealth Navies Rugby Cup. The longest cup competition is the annual Army Navy match which is held at Twickenham. The Unions first played each other in 1907. The Royal Navy has played the Royal Air Force annually since 1920 which is also the year that the Inter Service Competition was inaugurated. The Royal Navy annually play the Irish Defence Forces and have done since 2002. The final annual cup match is against the French Navy, the Marine Nationale. The first match was played in 2005 and since 2011 the Royal Navy Rugby Union have awarded caps for this fixture.\nThe Commonwealth Navies Rugby Cup is a triennial competition that was first played in 1997 where it was held in the UK. Since then it has been played in Australia (twice), New Zealand and also South Africa. The Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy have competed in every competition. The Royal New Zealand Navy missed the 2018 competition. The South African Navy competed in 2006. The Royal Navy won the first 6 tournaments with the loss of only one match, to the Royal New Zealand Navy in the 2006 competition. In 2014 the Royal New Zealand Navy were crowned champions on home soil following a 37–10 win over the Royal Navy and a 26-5 win over their Australian counterparts. The last time the competition was played was in 2018 when it was reduced to a single match between the hosts, Royal Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy, which the RN won.\nWomen's rugby.\nThe RNRU does field a women's rugby side although in the women’s Inter-Service competition that was introduced in 2003 the Army have been the dominant side winning every title from 2003-2018. In 2019 the RAF Women won the title for the first time.\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union started awarding caps from 2011 for the Women's XV with a qualification of six Inter Service matches since 2008, the first player to be awarded a cap under this qualification rule was Vic Percival and at the same match Sophie Roseman, Emma Swinton, Sarah Simms, Sophy Hinds and Pam Williams-Wilson qualified for their first cap.. In 2014 the qualifying criteria were altered and the Women were to be awarded their first cap after four Inter Service matches. The four matches had to be since 2009 and to include an appearance in IS2014 or later. This criterion left a couple of players in the hinterland between the old and the new criteria. After the 2014 match v the Royal Air Force Stacey Hargrave became the first to win her cap under the new criteria. The 2015 match against the Marine National Feminines was the first occasion that this game was considered a capped match. At the Annual General Meeting held in November 2017 the criteria were changed for a second time and the award of the Women's cap was brought in to alignment with the men's game. i.e. if you played in a capped game you received a cap without the requirement for any previous matches played. Like the previous change the amendment was not back dated.\nThe RN(W) players compete for the Roger Sherratt Trophy which is awarded to the member of the Royal Navy Women's Rugby Union Squad who is deemed to be the most valuable player of the season. This player will have shown strong leadership qualities both on and off the field, have provided a positive influence on the Squad and have displayed the attitude and bearing that epitomises the values of the Royal Navy Women Rugby Union Team.\nCaps and Colours.\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union first awarded caps for players of its Senior XV in their matches against the British Army. When the Royal Air Force formed the Inter Services competition in 1920 the Royal Navy Rugby Union also awarded caps for these matches. At the 2010 Annual General Meeting it was decided to award caps to the Senior XV's match against the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, and also for members of the Royal Navy Rugby Union's Women's team for their matches against the British Army and Royal Air Force.\nThe Royal Navy Rugby Union also award colours to members of their Referee Society on the first occasion that they either referee or are an assistant referee at a match involving the Senior XVs during the Inter Service competition.\nNotable former players.\nScotland internationalists.\nThe following former RNRU players have represented Scotland at full international level.\nEngland internationalists.\nThe following former RNRU players have represented England at full international level.\nWales internationalists.\nThe following former RNRU player has represented Wales at full international level."

The regular season featured 24 teams from 13 countries.\nThis season marked the first time since 2001–02 season that a qualifying round was used to determine the last two teams for the regular season. The qualifying round started on September 29, 2009, while the regular season of the Euroleague started on October 15, 2010. The season ended with the Euroleague Final Four, which was hosted at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, France, with the final on May 9, 2010.\nFormat.\nFor the first time in the modern Euroleague era, a preliminary stage was used to determine the last two teams in the regular season. 8 teams competed in qualification rounds, of which the 2 winners advanced to the regular season stage. Those teams joined 22 teams that had qualified directly to the regular season stage.\nAllocation.\nA maximum of three teams could qualify from any one country through their league position. However, 14 clubs held Euroleague Basketball A-linceces, which gave them automatic spots in the Euroleague Regular Season until 2011–12, regardless of their domestic league finish. These licenses were granted via a formula that considers each team's performance in its domestic league and the Euroleague, the television revenues Euroleague Basketball collects from its home country and the team's home attendance.\nThe rest of the field was filled with teams that qualified through their performance in their respective national leagues and wild card invitations.\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round (TH: Euroleague title holders):\nQualifying rounds.\nFirst preliminary round.\nGames were played on September 29 and October 2. Winners advanced to the second preliminary round, while losers parachuted into the Eurocup.\nSecond preliminary round.\nGame 1 of each match was played on October 6. Game 2 of the Benetton Treviso-Entente Orléanaise match was played on October 9, and Game 2 of Maroussi-Alba Berlin was played on October 11. The winners of each match advanced to the Regular Season, with the losers parachuting into the Eurocup.\nRegular season.\nThe Regular Season began on October 15, 2009 and concluded on January 14, 2010.\nIf teams were level on record at the end of the Regular Season, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:\nTop 16.\nThe survivors from the Regular Season advanced to the Top 16, where they were drawn into four groups of four teams each, playing home-and-home from January 27 through March 11. The draw was held at Euroleague headquarters in Barcelona, starting at 13:00 CET on January 18, and was streamed live on the official Euroleague site.\nQuarterfinals.\nTeam 1 hosted Games 1 and 2, plus Game 5 if necessary.

        "title": "Tennis on NBC",
        "text": "Tennis on NBC is the \"de facto\" branding used for broadcasts of major professional tennis tournaments that are produced by NBC Sports, the sports division of the NBC television network in the United States. The network has broadcast tennis events since 1955.\nThe network's tennis coverage normally airs during the afternoon; however for several weeks in the summer, its Sunday coverage during the morning hours of Grand Slam tennis tournaments may start as early as 8:00 a.m., resulting in the pre-emption of regular programming on that day (such as the political talk show \"Meet the Press\").\nOverview.\nNBC's relationship with tennis dates as far back as August 9, 1939. While at the amateur Eastern Grass Court Championships, in Rye, New York, NBC broadcast the first ever televised tennis match. NBC made history again at the 1955 Davis Cup, where they televised the first tennis match (United States vs. Australia) in color.\nUS Nationals coverage.\nNBC broadcast the US Nationals as early as 1952 and up until 1964. Bud Palmer, Jack Kramer, Lindsey Nelson, Don Budge, Bill Stern and Bill Talbert were among the commentators during this period.\nWimbledon coverage.\nNBC broadcast The Championships, Wimbledon beginning 1969. Americans had made a tradition of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\" specials during the tournament on weekends, in which live coverage (which under the guidance of then-NBC Sports executive producer Don Ohlmeyer and associate producer Bob Basche, began in 1979 for the men's rounds and in 1982 for the women) started early in the morning (as the Eastern Time Zone in the United States is five hours behind the United Kingdom) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from Bud Collins, whose tennis acumen and patterned trousers are well known to tennis fans in the United States. Collins was fired by NBC in 2007, but was promptly hired by ESPN, which holds the Wimbledon cable rights. For many years, NBC's primary host was Dick Enberg, who called his 28th and final Wimbledon in 2011.\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of \"Today\" at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the Eastern Time Zone and using tape-delay in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in 2009, ESPN2's coverage of the Tommy Haas-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous Ivo Karlović-Roger Federer quarterfinal in full.\nThe 2011 tournament marked the 43rd and final year of NBC's coverage. NBC issued a statement saying it had been outbid for the rights to future broadcasts, and beginning with the 2012 tournament, all live coverage moved exclusively to ESPN. Wimbledon became the second tennis Grand Slam event (after the Australian Open) to air live coverage in the United States exclusively on pay television, although replays of the tournament finals have aired on broadcast network ABC. Live Wimbledon matches have since returned to broadcast television with ABC televising middle weekend matches since 2022.\nFrench Open coverage.\nNBC's coverage of the French Open began in 1975. Other than a three-year stint for the tournament on CBS, NBC has remained the U.S. broadcast television home of the French Open since 1983. The network shows weekend morning early-round matches in the afternoon on tape-delay; however, if a match is still being played, it will televise the match live. NBC's current deal for the tournament does not allow ESPN2 or Tennis Channel to show NBC's tape-delayed matches. NBC also tape-delays the men's semifinal, broadcasting it in the late morning on the same day, however it broadcasts both finals live.\nOn August 5, 2012, NBC announced it had extended its broadcast agreement through 2024. Under the terms of this new deal, NBC would broadcast an additional ten hours of live coverage, including matches on Memorial Day and the women's semifinals. With the United States Tennis Association (USTA) agreeing to an eleven-year deal with ESPN for exclusive broadcast rights to the US Open, the French Open will be the only tennis tournament on American network television.\nOlympic Games coverage.\nIn 2004 and 2006, Bravo carried overnight and morning coverage of the Olympic Games from NBC Sports. In 2008, the channel did not carry any coverage, as NBCUniversal had acquired Oxygen, allowing Bravo to continue to carry its regular entertainment programming schedule during NBC's coverage of the Games. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, NBC Sports announced that Bravo would serve as the home of Olympic tennis events, providing 56 hours of coverage.\nOn-screen graphics.\nNBC Sports first switched to digital on-screen graphics in 1995, although in a very limited, text-based form. A modernized graphics package for the telecasts rolled out in 1999, based around translucent black rectangles, with beveled gold bars at the top and bottom, with blue accents for most sports (green for golf, purple for Wimbledon, and orange for the tennis French Open). Scoring bugs were still not a permanent feature, as they disappeared during plays until 2005, when the network introduced horizontal scorebars for its coverage of college football and hockey, which did not match the other graphics. The graphics, which still did not have any animation, were modified in 2002 to feature rounded edges, and the translucent color was changed from black to the color of the accents, which also replaced gold as the border color."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Jacques Kallis",
        "text": "Jacques Kallis is a South African cricketer who plays as an all-rounder. He has been described as \"the greatest cricketer ever\", and is considered one of the best all-rounders of all time, along with Sir Garfield Sobers. He has scored 45 centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test cricket, the most by any South African, and 17 centuries in One Day International (ODI) matches. He leads all South African batsmen in runs in both Test and ODI cricket.\nKallis made his Test debut against England in December 1995. He scored his maiden Test century just over two years later, in his seventh Test match, making 101 against Australia. In the 2003–04 series against the West Indies, Kallis scored a century in each of the four Test matches, becoming the first cricketer to pass 100 in every match of a series lasting more than three Tests. His feat also marked the first time a South African player scored centuries in four consecutive Test matches, a run he extended in his next match, scoring 150 not out against New Zealand, to become the second player, after Sir Donald Bradman, to pass 100 in five consecutive Tests. Kallis passed Gary Kirsten as South Africa's leading run-scorer in Test cricket when he reached his 22nd century during the 2004–05 tour of the West Indies. His achievements during the 2004–05 and 2005 cricket seasons, during which time he scored six Test centuries, resulted in him being named as Test Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In October 2007 he became the fourth South African to reach 100 in both innings of a Test match when he did so against Pakistan. He scored a century in each of the following three Tests, tallying five centuries in four Test matches. In doing so, he joined Bradman, Matthew Hayden and Ken Barrington as one of just four players to have scored centuries in four consecutive Test matches on two occasions. Kallis scored his first double century in Test cricket in December 2010, scoring an unbeaten 201 in the first Test against India. Prior to his double century, Kallis had been the only player in the top 15 Test run-scorers not to have reached 200. Later during the same series, Kallis struck centuries in both innings of a match for the second time in his career, becoming the first South African to achieve the feat on two occasions. He reached his second double century, and his highest score, in 2012 against Sri Lanka, making 224.\nIn ODI cricket, Kallis scored his maiden century in January 1998, totalling 111 against New Zealand. He reached his highest total in ODIs against the West Indies in February 2004, scoring 139. He generally scores at slower than one run per delivery, but does score more quickly on occasions on which he reaches a century, averaging 90.24 runs per hundred balls, rather than 72.77 when he scores less than 100. His highest strike-rate when scoring a century was 117.43, achieved when he scored 128 not out against the Netherlands during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He is the only South African to have scored over 10,000 runs in ODI cricket, while his 17 ODI centuries rank him second behind the 21 scored by Herschelle Gibbs among his countrymen."

The Swedish women's national team played its first games in April 1987, during the 1987 Women's World Tournament in Ontario, Canada.\nThe first, unofficial National Championship was played in 1985. Three unofficial championships were held, in 1984–85, 1985–86, and 1986–87. The championships were played with round-robin tournament structure. Nacka HK won the National Championship title in all three seasons.\nThe Swedish Ice Hockey Association (SIF) established the first, official Swedish Championship for the 1987–88 season. Division 1 served as the qualifying league for the Swedish Championship. This league had a variable number of teams distributed into some small regional leagues, followed by a national playoff.\nDuring the 2007–08 season, the best Division 1 teams qualified for a new league, the Riksserien (‘National Series’), which became the top-tier league. Division 1 became the second level of women's hockey in Sweden. The Riksserien comprised eight teams. Each team would face the seven opposing teams in four games, two at home and two away. The top two teams at the end of the regular season would qualify for the semi-finals. The teams classified in third to sixth place would each play a three-game playoff qualifying series. In the semifinals, the match for the third place and final depend on a simple match. The teams ranked seventh and eighth at the end of the regular season would face the top two from Division 1 in a promotion/relegation series to remain in the Swedish Women's Hockey League or be relegated Division 1\nThe Riksserien was reorganized and rebranded as the Svenska damhockeyligan (SDHL, ) prior to the 2016–17 season. The change was meant to increase public interest and sponsorship of the teams by branding the league in the style of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) and to encourage SHL teams to promote their sister teams.\nSwedish Championship.\nResults.\nNotes: \nTournaments.\nThe following are IIHF tournaments that were hosted in Sweden."

Uruguay beat Chile 1–0, achieving their 13th Copa América title.\nBackground.\nUruguay had eliminated Argentina (reigning World Champion by then) based in their good defense and tactical order. As former defender and Olympic champion José Nasazzi stated, \"We make the first 10 fouls of the match and then we win playing fair\", that phrase synthesized the Uruguayan rough style of play to prevail psychologically over the rival since the first minute of the match.\nUnder that premise, defensive players Obdulio Trasante and José Perdomo applied that rough tactics during the first minutes, carrying the Argentine side to that style of play, confusing their rival. Once the first objective was fulfilled, Uruguay started to play fair, keeping the possession of the ball until the match ended.\nThe match.\nIn the decisive match played at Estadio Monumental of Buenos Aires, Chile played dirty, committing a great amount of fouls, with Enzo Francescoli as one of their main victims. Because of that rough style of playing, defender Eduardo Gómez was sent off by Brazilian referee Romualdo Arpi Filho with before the 15 minutes of the match.\nNevertheless, Francascoli would be also sent off after fouling rival Fernando Astengo. Uruguay won the final through the highlighted performances of Alfonso Domínguez (who controlled the movements of Ivo Basay, Chile's most notable forward), and central midfielder José Perdomo, who played both, defensive and offensive positions."

        "title": "Futures Collegiate Baseball League",
        "text": "The Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) is an eight-team collegiate summer baseball league. It has four franchises in Massachusetts, two in Connecticut, and one each in New Hampshire and Vermont.\nFormat.\nThe Futures League is a wood-bat league. Its regular season schedule calls for 64 games per team as of 2023 (32 home and 32 away games).\nFCBL ballplayers are unpaid collegiate athletes who join the league to gain experience and exposure to Major League Baseball scouts. The FCBL mission is to prepare young men for the rigors of playing professional baseball.\nUnique rules.\nThe league accepts players who were on college baseball rosters during the preceding spring season, as well as players who have signed a commitment to play college baseball in the upcoming school year. In 2018, teams were allowed to carry up to five \"commits\". At least 15 of the 30 players on a roster must have a local connection, either residing in New England or affiliated with a college in New England.\nSince 2017, regular-season games that are tied after regulation and remain tied after one extra inning are decided by a \"Home Run Derby\", a coach-pitched home-run hitting contest. In each round, the visitors compete, followed by the home team. A team's score in a round is the number of home runs it hits before making a certain number of \"outs\" (defined as any ball hit in fair territory that is not a home run). In the first round, teams can use up to three hitters and are allowed 10 \"outs\". If the teams hit the same number of home runs, a second round is played that allows five \"outs\". If still tied, a third round gives the batters three \"outs\".\nSince 2023, the top 4 teams in \"points percentage\" make the playoffs. Points (the numerator) are two points for each game won plus 1 point for each loss by Home Run Derby. (Compare overtime losses in the National Hockey League points system.) The denominator is the number of games played, which compensates when weather prevents a team from playing its complete schedule.\nThe original FCBL Home Run Derby was a race against the clock, in which the three rounds comprised 3, 2, and then 1 minute.\nHistory.\nThe Futures League was co-developed by:\nThe Carminucci Sports Group sought to place an NECBL franchise on the island of Martha's Vineyard, and the Spinners hoped to do the same in Nashua, New Hampshire. The NECBL declined to expand, so the organizations formed a separate league. The FCBL aimed to use professional baseball operators with proven histories. Most FCBL venues are former professional ballparks (marked with an asterisk in the table below).\n2011 season.\nThe league started play in the 2011 season. Martha's Vineyard, Nashua, Seacoast, and Torrington were the charter franchises. The championship paired the top two franchises in a best-of-three series. Nashua (27–16) won the regular season and defeated Torrington (25–17) for the championship.\n2012 season.\nFor the 2012 season, the FCBL expanded from four to nine teams. The league expanded into the Leominster/Fitchburg, Massachusetts area with the addition of the Wachusett Dirt Dawgs. In addition, the FCBL induced the North Shore and Old Orchard Beach franchises to jump from the NECBL, as well as the Pittsfield and Brockton franchises of the professional, independent Can-Am League to convert to the collegiate format. The Pittsfield franchise was acquired by majority owner Marvin Goldklang and the Goldklang Group, which owns and operates four other minor-league baseball teams.\nAn all-star game was played, pitting selected players from the four charter teams against the five new teams.\nThe post-season was also revamped to involve four of the nine teams. The winners of two best-of-three division series (#4 plays #1, #3 plays #2) competed in a best-of-three championship series. Nashua repeated as FCBL Champion.\n2013 season.\nThe 2013 season was played with the same nine franchises as in 2012. The playoffs were expanded to include the top six teams of the nine. The teams finishing first and second got a first-round bye, with the remaining playoff teams to play a new initial round consisting of a single game.\nEarlier, a league press release had mentioned that \"The FCBL is planning and negotiating with other locations for further expansion in the 2013 season.\" Speculation had centered on Worcester, Massachusetts, where the Worcester Tornadoes had lost its affiliation with the Can-Am League. A Tornadoes creditor, John Creedon Jr., was in discussions with the College of the Holy Cross to secure a lease for Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field.\nThe all-star game was structured as Massachusetts versus \"New England\" (the four non-Massachusetts teams).\nThe regular season was extended by two days (to August 9 and 10) in view of the season's many rain-outs. The games scheduled for these days sometimes were not against opponents that were due to complete a rained-out game. The one-game play-in games occurred on the afternoon of August 11—not at the site of the higher-seeded team, but at the site of the winner's opponent in the next round, which began the same evening. This next round, a best-of-three series, was slated for alternating sites, though in neither case was the third game necessary. The final round reverted to the prior year's rule, in which the higher-seeded team (in this case, Martha's Vineyard) had the option of hosting the first game or any remaining games. Martha's Vineyard elected to open the series in Nashua, on August 14, and won the series at home the next day.\n2014 season.\nFor the 2014 season the league split into an East and West division of five teams each. The All-Star Game assembled teams comprising the best players of each division; on July 24, the West beat the East, 4–1. The regular season expanded to 56 games, with each team playing 28 home games and 28 road games. No team actually played 56 games, as rain-outs occurring late in the season were not made up. The 2014 FCBL playoffs were conducted as in 2013, except that the rules gave the winner of each division the bye in round one, and guaranteed that, of the next four teams with the best overall records, the higher-seeded team would host the one-game play-in.\nOn September 20, 2013, John Creedon Jr., who prior to the 2013 season had discussed bringing baseball back to the city of Worcester, announced that he would indeed operate the league's tenth franchise at Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field starting in 2014, and unveiled the Bravehearts on December 2, 2013.\nThe two division winners, Worcester (West) and Martha's Vineyard (East), won their semifinal series and met in the best-of-three final series. Worcester swept the series to become the 2014 champions.\n2015 season.\nFor 2015, the Old Orchard Beach franchise was replaced by the Bristol Blues. The Nashua franchise was moved from the West Division to the East Division to maintain both divisions at five teams. The playoffs were further expanded to include eight of the ten teams in post-season play. The first two playoff rounds consisted of a single elimination game, in two days reducing the playoff field from eight teams to two. The East was the stronger division; the new Bristol team (33–23), which won the West Division, had a worse record than three of the teams in the East. Bristol faced the Worcester Bravehearts (26–30) in the final series; last year's champion had flirted with elimination for much of the season, but came on strong in the final weeks of the regular season to finish second in the West. The higher-seeded Bristol elected that the series begin in Worcester, where Worcester won. In the games played at Bristol, Bristol won Game 2, but Worcester won the deciding game, on August 16, to repeat as FCBL champions.\n2016 season.\nIn November 2015, the league announced that the playoff format would revert to that of 2014, with six of ten teams making the post-season. The Seacoast Mavericks had the first winning season in its six-year history, but lost the semifinal series to Nashua in three games. Worcester returned to the finals, but Nashua won that series, defeating Worcester first at home and then in Worcester.\nA visit by Bristol to North Shore on July 27 was suspended at 7 minutes after midnight, tied 4-4 after 17 innings. It was completed on August 4, North Shore scoring the winning run on a sacrifice fly in the 21st inning. The game was the longest FCBL game ever, taking a total of 6:04 to play. It disrupted the scheduling of both pitching staffs and led the league to announce a rules change the next year.\n2017 season.\nOn December 20, 2016, the Futures League published a 2017 schedule for a nine-team league not including the Titans. The following month, the league announced a point system, similar to that used by the National Hockey League (NHL), to decide playoff seedings. For games decided without the need for a Home Run Derby (see below), the winning team would receive two points. For games requiring a Home Run Derby, both teams would receive one point, with a team winning a derby receiving an additional point. Near the end of the regular season, the league clarified that the basis for seeding teams in the playoffs would actually be \"point percentage\": the ratio of actual points to potential points (total potential points being twice the number of games played). The clarification was necessary because the clubs had had different numbers of games cancelled by bad weather. The interpretation eventually helped Worcester qualify for the post-season at the expense of Martha's Vineyard.\nAll six games of the play-in and semifinal rounds were won by the lower-seeded team. This set up a final series between fifth-seeded Nashua and sixth-seeded Worcester, a repeat of the 2016 finals. Defending champion Nashua Silver Knights won one game away and at home against the Worcester Bravehearts to repeat as champions.\nIntroduction of the Home Run Derby.\nOn January 27, 2017, the league announced that regular-season games tied after 10 innings would be decided by a home-run hitting contest. The league stated that the purpose of this rule was to protect pitchers' arms and encourage college coaches to recommend the league to their pitchers.\nThe first use of the Home Run Derby was June 7, when the visiting Martha's Vineyard Sharks tied the Wachusett Dirt Dawgs, 13–13, after 10 innings. In the first (three-minute) round of the Home Run Derby, the Sharks hit a total of 5 home runs out of Doyle Field, using both their time-outs to substitute batters at each one-minute interval. The Dirt Dawgs used Zack Tower, who had not played in the regulation game. He hit 5 home runs in 70 seconds, at which point the Dirt Dawgs used their first time-out. Tower remained at bat and hit the deciding home run shortly after.\nIn the 238 games played in the 2017 regular season, a total of 10 used the Home Run Derby. There were no tie games. In 7-inning games of doubleheaders, the Home Run Derby was used if the teams were tied after 8 innings.\n2018 season.\nAfter the 2017 season, the Seacoast Mavericks declined to remain at Leary Field in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 2018 as it envisioned a sports complex in Dover, New Hampshire. The Wachusett Dirt Dawgs said that the city commission controlling the grounds declined to renew the operating agreement as \"(The DPW) felt we weren't cleaning up after ourselves as well as we should\". Both clubs paid their 2018 dues, anticipating a return to the league in 2019.\nThe league allowed teams to carry up to 5 \"commits\" (high-school graduates intending to play college baseball in the coming year). The league retained the Home Run Derby, but dropped the provision for tie games and standings based on a point system. The league also kept the 2017 format in which the top 6 teams made the playoffs (the lower-seeded four entering a one-game play-in), though this was now 6-of-7 rather than 6-of-9. In each three-game playoff series, the higher-seeded team was no longer given an option but was scheduled to host Game 1, and Game 3 if necessary.\nA scoreless tie between Bristol and Nashua on June 7 was settled with the first Home Run Derby that had ever gone past the first (three-minute) round into the second (two-minute) round. Bristol's Connor Nolan hit three home runs in each round to out-hit Nashua, 6–5, and to give Bristol the victory by an official score of 1–0. Two other Derbies were tied after one round and went to the second round.\nIn the playoffs, top-seeded Martha's Vineyard and Worcester eventually became the finalists. When a weather-delayed final series resulted in a deciding Game 3 on Martha's Vineyard on August 13, which was called after being tied 1–1 in the first inning, Martha's Vineyard and Worcester were declared co-champions.\n2019 season.\nIn the 2018 off-season, Commissioner Chris Hall announced his resignation. The league selected Joe Paolucci to replace him. The FCBL announced a new ownership group in Westfield, Massachusetts, but the move was countered as the Martha's Vineyard Sharks switched to the NECBL. The Futures League claimed this move would require either a two-thirds \"hardship\" vote of other franchises or payment of an exit fee, and sued to block the switch. The Sharks countersued, saying the league bylaws were never signed. The conflict delayed into 2019 the release of schedules by both leagues. On January 19, the NECBL announced the Sharks' entry into that league (replacing a team that folded and maintaining the NECBL at 13 teams). The FCBL announced its schedule on January 24, again with 7 franchises, 6 of them qualifying for the playoffs. On February 20, the league announced that the new seventh team would be called the Westfield Starfires.\nJohn Creedon Jr., the owner of the Worcester Bravehearts, bought the Nashua Silver Knights from Drew Weber and from the others to which Weber had sold a minority interest.\nThe Westfield franchise trailed the other six during the regular season, suggesting its elimination from the playoffs—sometimes losing so many games as to give all six other franchises a .500 winning average or better. This was the case at the end of the regular season, Westfield finishing at 15–41. The other teams had relative parity, and first place changed hands frequently. Brockton and Bristol avoided the play-in round, but Worcester survived that round, won the semifinal series against Brockton, and swept the final series against Bristol to win the title.\nThe rules for locating the semifinal series apparently were changed via conference call to give the lower-seeded club the right to host the second game, but were changed back for the finals to give the higher-seeded club the choice of hosting the first game or all remaining games. In addition, Worcester's semifinal series was delayed for one day based on its lack of access to Fitton Field on August 7.\n2020 season.\nChanges for 2020 were announced on October 28, 2019. The Bristol Blues left the FCBL and joined the NECBL. The New Britain Bees, which formerly played in the Atlantic League, took the Blues' place as the seventh team. The 2020 season was to be played in two halves, with the first-half champion, second-half champion, and the two teams with next best won-lost records overall, advancing to the playoffs. The Home Run Derby to break ties continued for a fourth year, but lasting only a single, three-minute round.\nAdditional changes were forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The NECBL and the Cape Cod League did not play at all, and the start of the FCBL's 2020 season was delayed. On June 22, the league announced a 39-game schedule to be played by six teams, without the Pittsfield Suns. Teams would play as a single division with a single, best-of-3 playoff series between the top two teams.\nBased on \"reopening guidelines\" of the governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, the league played an unbalanced schedule continuing further into August than ever before. Opening Day was July 2 in Connecticut and New Hampshire and July 7 for the four Massachusetts clubs. Mondays were league-wide off days but were available to make up games that had been rained out.\nThe playoffs were August 20 through 22, between the Worcester Bravehearts (23-15) and the Nashua Silver Knights (23-16). Worcester had played its home games at Doyle Field in Leominster, but the entire final series was played at Nashua, Worcester playing as the home team in games 1 and 3 due to its higher seed. Worcester won the first game but lost the second and third games, giving Nashua its fifth championship.\n2021 season.\nFor 2021, the Futures League added the Vermont Lake Monsters in Burlington, Vermont, formerly of the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. Chris English, the owner of the Brockton Rox, is the leader of the Lake Monsters' ownership group. The North Shore Navigators returned to the New England Collegiate Baseball League for 2021. The Norwich Sea Unicorns, also from the defunct New York-Penn League, joined the Futures League in 2021, bringing the league back up to eight teams. Vermont would go on to win the 2021 Futures League Championship Series.\n2022 season.\nIn 2022, the Futures League remained at eight teams. For the third consecutive year, select Futures League games were broadcast on regional cable sports channel NESN. The Brockton Rox hosted five sons of former Major League players, including the sons of Boston Red Sox legends David Ortiz, Pedro Martinez, and Manny Ramirez.\nThe 2022 season saw the Vermont Lake Monsters win the regular season title for the second year in a row. New Britain, Nashua, and Westfield rounded out the four-team playoff field. The Nashua Silver Knights defeated the Vermont Lake Monsters in three games to win their sixth Futures League championship.\nNashua would lose the first game at Centennial Field by a score of 12-0, but rebounded to win Game 2 at Holman Stadium, 6-5 on a walk-off, and the deciding Game 3 in Burlington, 6-5.\n2024 season.\nThe league announced that Pittsfield would not play the 2024 season because of safety issues at Wahconah Park. A league-operated team will play the Pittsfield schedule (road games only). This decision reduced the regular season from 64 to about 56 games. \nLeague officers.\nJoe Paolucci is the commissioner of the FCBL, succeeding Chris Hall, who served from 2011 through 2018. John Creedon, Jr., the owner of the Worcester Bravehearts and Nashua Silver Knights, is chairman of the league's board of directors."

        "title": "Afghanistan women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Afghanistan women's national cricket team was the team that represented the country of Afghanistan in international women's cricket matches. The team was first established in 2010, but played only a single tournament amidst opposition from Islamists opposed to women's sport. An attempt at revival was made in 2020 when the Afghanistan Cricket Board awarded central contracts to 25 players. However, the team was disbanded following the 2021 Taliban offensive and capture of Kabul in accordance with the Taliban's ban on women's sport.\nHistory.\n2010–2014.\nThe team was first formed in 2010, but disbanded in 2014. Although the team never played representative cricket in ICC competition, it had been scheduled to take part in the 2011 ACC Women's Twenty20 Championship in Kuwait, which ran from 17 to 25 February. The team was forced to withdraw from the tournament before travelling to Kuwait due to elements in Afghanistan opposing women's participation in sport.\nIn 2012, the team participated in a 6 team tournament in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, and became Champion by winning four matches and tying one.\n2020–August 2021.\nIn November 2020, the Afghanistan Cricket Board awarded central contracts to twenty-five players, in their bid to form a national team to take part in ICC tournaments. In October 2020, ACB organised skills and fitness camp as well as the national team trial camp at the Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground for the players who were selected from the talent pool.\nIn April 2021, the ICC awarded permanent Test and One Day International (ODI) status to all full member women's teams.\nAugust 2021–present.\nConcerns regarding the safety of the Afghan women cricketers and development of women's cricket in Afghanistan were raised following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the 15 August 2021 Fall of Kabul.\n, three of the Afghan women's cricket team, Roya Samim and her two sisters, were in exile in Canada. Samim said that the team members remaining in Afghanistan were afraid of the Taliban. She stated that the International Cricket Council (ICC) had failed to respond to emails calling for help from team members seeking evacuation from Afghanistan, and that the Afghan Cricket Board (ACB) had given no help except to say \"Wait\". The ICC said that it was not aware of having received emails asking for help and that it was closely monitoring the situation. According to \"The Guardian\", the ICC was keeping in contact with the ACB in order to avoid acting unilaterally. An ACB spokesperson stated that the Taliban appeared to support the continuation of men's cricket.\nOne of the team members was threatened by the Taliban after the fall of Kabul with being killed \"if [she tried] to play cricket again\". Another team member, in exile , stated that the ICC \"never help[ed]\" the women's cricket team, \"always disappoint[ed]\" the team, and only communicated with the ACB rather than contacting the women's team directly. Several of the team members expressed their expectations and hopes for the women's team to reorganise.\nHamid Shinwari, chief executive officer of the ACB, stated in early September 2021 that he expected the Afghan women's cricket team \"to be stopped\". The Taliban also said that Afghan women would be barred from playing sport.\nHowever, Afghanistan Cricket Board's CEO Lutfullah Stanikzai clarified later in an Al Jazeera interview that women will be allowed to play cricket and that they would not be stopped.\nAs of April 2023, most of the squad had re-united in Australia."

        "text": "The Coupe de France () an ice hockey competition in France. It is the premier knockout cup organized by the French Ice Hockey Federation.\nFormula.\nParticipation is mandatory for the three highest tiers of the French men's hockey pyramid, and voluntary for members of the fourth tier, which may require the staging of a preliminary round for select teams in some years. Teams from the country's top tier, the Ligue Magnus, enter in the second round. When teams from different tiers are drawn against one another, the lower-tier team will automatically be designated as the host side (except for the final, which is played at a predetermined venue). For the first two rounds, which predominantly involve semi-professional and amateur organizations, teams are drawn from regional groups. Thereafter, draws are entirely random.\nFinal venue.\nIn early decades, the competition's format changed frequently and the final was not held at a regular venue. In 2005, Méribel Olympic Ice Rink, known for hosting the hockey tournament during the 1992 Winter Olympics, was appointed as the host venue. Following two seasons there, Federation president Luc Tardif decided to move the event to Palais ominisport de Paris-Bercy (today Accor Arena), while Méribel became host to the final of a newly created secondary cup, the Coupe de la Ligue ('League Cup'). The choice of the capital's largest and most famous indoor arena turned out to be an unexpected success, providing the French game with a marquee event and significantly increasing the Coupe de France's prestige.&lt;br&gt;\nTrophy.\nFor the 2001–02 edition, when it was decided to make the event a regular fixture, a permanent trophy was inaugurated. Of classic shape, it was made of blue porcelain with golden accents. In the 2006 off-season, it took the name of influential Canadian-born player and coach , who had recently died. In 2022, the original trophy, which had proven very susceptible to damage, was replaced by a new one made of metal, and chosen from three possible designs via a fan vote."

        "text": "The Coupe de la Ligue () was a French ice hockey competition which took place between the 2006–07 and 2015–16 seasons. It was the league cup for Ligue Magnus clubs, and served as the country's secondary cup competition after the Coupe de France.\nHistory.\nBy 2006, France's top tier, the Ligue Magnus, included a few surviving teams from the defunct Ligue Élite (1997–2002), a failed professional circuit that played both mid-week and weekend games, while the majority of its members were former participants in the semi-professional Nationale 1 (second tier), who had been enticed to form a new league with their larger peers, partly based on the promise that the fledgling loop would—at least in the beginning—keep the cheaper, weekend-based schedule they used to operate on.\nAs such, the Ligue Magnus initially represented a drop in intensity, which the French Ice Hockey Federation was intent on remedying without alienating its more budget-conscious constituents. This led to a transitional period, where the governing body kept regular season games at a relative minimum (26) to preserve the semi-professional model demanded by some clubs, while adding potential cup and playoff games to provide more competitive and revenue opportunities to those who wanted them. The creation of the Coupe de la Ligue was such an initiative.\nIn 2016, French federation president Luc Tardif announced that, despite the continued reluctance of some structurally or financially challenged clubs, he would enact the long-delayed switch of the regular season to a 44-game, three-game-a-week schedule, which was needed to keep in touch with accepted international standards. As part of the move, the Coupe de la Ligue was phased out.\nFormula.\nFor its first two seasons, the Coupe de la Ligue consisted of home-and-home series decided on aggregate score for each round except the final, which consisted of a single game played on neutral ice. From the third to the tenth and final season, the competition started with a round robin phase, where teams were split into four regional groups of four teams each and played each other twice, once at home and once away. The two best teams from each group qualified for the knockout phase, with quarterfinals and semifinals consisting of home-and-home series decided on aggregate score, and the final consisting of a single game played on neutral ice.\nFor each of the ten seasons, the final was hosted at Méribel Olympic Ice Rink, which hosted the Coupe de France final before 2007, when it moved to Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\nThe Coupe de la Ligue featured 16 participants. As the Ligue Magnus had 14 clubs at the time, two external teams were included. They were originally the two highest ranked second-tier (now called Division 1) teams based on the previous season's rankings. From the 2010–11 season, one of the two second-tier teams was replaced by the French under 20 national team, as preparation for December's World Junior Championships. However, it was barred from advancing to the elimination phase."

Cars can accelerate by up to 60 mph (three spaces) per turn in increments of 20 mph. Corners have speed limits beyond which a car will spin off; excessive braking to avoid this will incur tyre wear and/or brake wear determined by rolling the dice and reading the result against a \"Speed Reduction chart\" printed on the board.\nWhen either tyre or brake wear becomes excessive acceleration and deceleration are limited until the car visits the pits to reset the gauges. On doing so a Pit card must be drawn to obtain either a small advantage or a small disadvantage.\nPlaying a Tactic card at the start of ones turn will provide a small advantage e.g. a speed boost. Five are dealt to each player at the start of the game.\nWhen a car crosses the chequered line having completed the agreed number of laps it is finished. Play continues until the last player in the round has had their turn. The winner is the car furthest beyond the finish line.\nVariations.\nWith few players or more than one game set it is possible to play using teams of cars.\nStrategy.\nStrategy primarily involves:\nRecognition.\nAn original copy of the game is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, a prominent art and design museum in London. The museum describes the game by saying \"It was a success when released in 1962, and was released in various international editions throughout the next two decades.\"\nThe British broadsheet newspaper the \"Daily Telegraph\" carried an online motoring-section article in 2004 noting that \"In the 1970s, many a wet Saturday afternoon could happily be spent in your living room, ... Waddington's Formula 1 – the prince of all board games – on the floor.\" and the following year the same column mentioned it as a recommended retro purchase.\nReviews by board-game enthusiasts and special-interest sites include:\nThe game continued to be bought and sold online in 2015."

The tournament was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation, which titled it the Amateur World Series from the 1938 tournament through the 1986 AWS. Panama were first-time hosts (beating out bids from Chinese Taipei and Venezuela), with games held in four cities, from October 1 to 15.\nThe Netherlands defeated Cuba in the final, winning its first title, and only the second ever for a European team, after Great Britain's win of the inaugural 1938 AWS.\nThere were 16 participating countries, split into two groups for Round 1, with the first four of each group qualifying for an amalgamated Round 2, which determined the single-game matchups for the finals. Games were played in the Panamanian cities of Aguadulce, Chitré, Panama City and Santiago de Veraguas. The final two medals games were held in Panama City.\nThis was the final BWC tournament, which was replaced in 2015 by the quadrennial WBSC Premier12.\nTeams.\nSixteen teams qualified for the tournament, placing high enough in regional tournaments that doubled as qualifying tournaments for the event or by automatic qualification by hosting the tournament.\nFormat.\nThe 16 participating teams were divided into two round robin pools, the top four of each pool advancing to the second round, in which each qualified team played each of the qualified teams from the other pool. The top two teams in the standings after the second round then qualified for the championship final.\nTie-breaking rules.\nStandings were determined by the win–loss records over all games played within a pool. In case of a tie, the order of the teams tied was determined by, in this sequence, (a) the win–loss record of the games played among the tied teams (=head-to-head HTH), (b) the highest difference between the ratios of runs scored per offensive innings and runs allowed per defensive innings (=Team's Quality Balance TQB), (c) the highest difference between the ratios of earned runs scored per offensive innings and earned runs allowed per defensive innings (ERTQB), (d) the highest batting average in the games played among the tied teams, (e) a coin flip.\nVenues.\nPanama City was the primary city for the event, and also the host of Group 1, while Aguadulce, Coclé; Santiago de Veraguas; and Chitré, Herrera Province were host to Group 2.\nConditions.\nThe tournament was marred by inclement weather, causing a number of rainout games that had to be made up, increasing the pressure on the tournament schedule. In the end, eleven of the sixteen second-round games needed to be played within two days, requiring teams to play doubleheaders of games shortened to seven innings, and the bronze medal game in the final round had to be canceled to allow the final to be played.\nAwards.\nThe IBAF announced the following awards at the completion of the tournament."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Nemzeti Bajnokság I was the sixtieth edition of the top level championship in the Hungarian team handball for women. The regular season started on 2 September 2010 with a clash between UKSE Szekszárd and defending champions Győri ETO KC, and ended on 27 March 2011, also including Győr, this time as hosts against Újbuda TC. The postseason began on 7 April 2011 and was concluded on 21 May 2011 with the final round classification groups. Győri Audi ETO KC went on to win all of their playoff matches and took their fourth consecutive title and eighth overall.\nOverview.\nTeams.\nA total of twelve teams will contest the league, including nine sides from the 2009–10 Nemzeti Bajnokság I and three promoted teams from the 2009–10 Nemzeti Bajnokság I/B. Although officially only two clubs got relegated, ASA-Consolis Hódmezővásárhelyi NKC went close to bankruptcy and were unable to meet demands to enter the new season. All their players could and have moved away freely, and so did some quality youth prospects as well. In this situation the board adjudged there is not a long-term perspective to run the club and decided not to enter the championship and to cease the club. Since then, the handball in Hódmezővásárhely is represented by grassroot team Hódmezővásárhelyi Leány Kézilabda Club.\nAfter the decision of pulling out, the Hungarian Handball Federation asked UKSE Szekszárd, the third-best team in the NB I/B last season (the second team of Győri Audi ETO KC finished ahead of them, but according to the rules they can not play in the same division as their parent team), whether they have the financial background and are able to join the league. They met all the criteria and replaced Hódmezővásárhelyi NKC not long before the new season began.\nOther two dropped teams, Kiskunhalas NKSE-Bravotel and Hunnia KSK had an everyday fight for the survive, and it stamped their performances: both of them achieved only a single win during the regular season and were unable to improve in the postseason thus fallen out hopeless.\nBeside the unexpected promotion of UKSE Szekszárd the two winners of NB I/B have climbed into the top division: ÉTV-Érdi VSE from the Western Group with an impressive 25-1-0 balance and Bugyi SE-Újbuda from the Eastern Group. The latter one moved from Bugyi to Budaörs and later to Újbuda, changing their name simply to Újbuda TC for the new season.\nLast year's league champions Győri ETO KC and silver medallists DVSC-Korvex compete in the 2010–11 EHF Champions League, while Budapest Bank-Békéscsabai Előre NKSE alongside SYMA Váci NKSE enter the 2010–11 EHF Cup. Despite lost to Győr in the Hungarian Cup final, Ferencvárosi TC advanced to the 2010–11 EHF Cup Winners' Cup as ETO already secured a Champions League spot.\nSponsorship changes.\nFive out of the twelve NBI teams have signed new name sponsorship deals for the new season. Just after the end of the 2009–2010 season, on 2 June 2010, Váci NKSE club director András Németh announced in a press conference, that from the next year the team will compete under the name SYMA Váci NKSE after their new sponsor. Mobile phone distributor RightPhone, which have been under contract with Ferencváros last year, have agreed a one-year deal with Alcoa FKC thus changing club name to Alcoa FKC RightPhone. Budapest Bank, patronizing the Hungarian handball since years, have tightened the relationship with Békéscsaba and became their main financial supporter. Dunaújváros, which have faced the threat of dissolution two years ago, secured a one-year deal with Regale Klímatechnika Kft., altering their name to Dunaúvárosi Regale Klíma.\nFrom 2 October 2010 Ferencváros were known as FTC-Jógazdabank by signing a contract with Jógazda Szövetkezeti Takarékpénztár. The financial company stated, that their long-term plan is to \"make Ferencváros a dominant team both in domestic and international level.\" However, it came like a bolt from the blue, when on 3 January 2011, just two months after the sponsoring contract was signed, the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority reported that they have revoked the license of the bank and simultaneously have initiated the liquidation process. As board president Zsolt Ákos Jeney revealed, by losing their name sponsor they count with a loss of a staggering 25 percent of their planned budget. He added also, that the management immediately held talks with other sponsors, which ensured them of their support and even backed the idea to increase their financial contribution in the future.\nMeanwhile, the club management was also looking for a new sponsor, which they found in a relatively short time: Ferencvárosi TC have called a press conference for 3 February 2011, where they announced Rail Cargo Hungaria Zrt. as their new naming sponsor. Imre Kovács, CEO of the rail logistics company, have stated that social responsibility is an integral part their policy and they are ready to support the development of valuable communities with financial injections. Under the terms of agreement, the club has been renamed to FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria.\nSiófok KC, that already began to prepare for the next season, agreed a sponsorship contract with Galerius Wellness and Spa Center on 5 May 2011. As a result, the team wear the name of the bath and compete under the name Siófok KC-Galerius Fürdő until 31 December 2011.\nPostseason.\nClassification round 9–12.\nTeams finished in bottom four positions after the regular season enter the classification round for 9–12 places, where a double round-robin system is used. In addition, they are given bonus points depending on their final ranking in the league phase of the championship. Érd, which took the ninth spot, were given four points, tenth placed Siófok were awarded three, Újbuda TC took two points while last placed UKSE Szekszárd got one point. Clubs with the two lowest combined points get relegated.\nTable.\nAdditional points that were awarded after the final positions in the regular season are indicated in bonus points column.\nClassification round 5–8.\nSimilarly to the classification round of 9–12, the teams play twice against each other, on a home and on an away leg. Furthermore, they are rewarded with bonus points that are added to the points they win in the postseason and their combined total points decide the final ranking.\nTable.\nAdditional points that were awarded after the final positions in the regular season are indicated in the bonus points column.\nChampionship playoff.\nGyőri Audi ETO KC were proved invincible in the regular season once again and thus deservedly took the top spot of the championship playoff, having been drawn together with SYMA Váci NKSE, that finished in fourth position. Meanwhile, FTC-Rail Cargo Hungaria secured the second place after a hard-fought final day victory over Vác, which was just enough to end the regular season one point ahead of DVSC-Korvex, against them they begin the playoff campaign, where a best-of-three knockout is used. If a match ends with a draw, instead of playing extra time halves, the winner is decided by penalty shootout."

The competition took place for the first time in New Zealand, the third time on Oceanian soil after Australia staged the 1981 and 1993 editions. A total of 52 matches were played in seven host cities.\nDuring the first meeting of the local organising committee in January 2013, provisional dates of 19 June to 11 July were given towards hosting of games, with a final decision on stadiums and cities originally meant to be taken in February 2013. Two more postponements then followed.\nFrance, the 2013 champions, were unable to defend their title as they failed to reach the final round of the UEFA qualifying tournament. In doing so, they became the fourth consecutive incumbent title holder to fail to qualify for the subsequent tournament.\nSerbia won the final against Brazil 2–1, becoming the first team representing the country to win a FIFA competition title since their independence from Yugoslavia and the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro. Yugoslavia previously won the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship.\nHost selection.\nFour FIFA member associations officially submitted their bids to host the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup by the deadline of 11 February 2011. On 3 March 2011, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held for the first time in New Zealand. This is the third FIFA competition staged in this country, after the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.\nVenues.\nAuckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington and Whangarei were the 7 cities chosen to host the competition.\nBefore the stadium announcements were made, Dunedin City council suggested in January 2013, that it would not bid to host matches at Forsyth Barr Stadium (also known as Otago Stadium) unless the costs (an estimated $1m) could be lowered. The stadium hosted seven matches there, the last of which being a Round of 16 game.\nQualified teams.\nIn addition to host nation New Zealand, 23 nations qualified from six separate continental competitions.\nDraw and schedule.\nThe final draw was held on 10 February 2015, 17:30 local time, at the SkyCity Grand, Auckland. For the draw, the 24 teams were divided into four seeding pots:\nAs a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage. As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place on 23 March 2015 in Dakar, Senegal, at the tournament's conclusion to determine the groups where the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed CAF teams would play in, to ensure there was no manipulation of games in the qualifying tournament ensuring fairness to all qualified teams.\nThe schedule of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 21 referees, 6 support referees, and 42 assistant referees were selected for the tournament.\nSquads.\nThe 24 squads were officially announced by FIFA on 21 May 2015. Each participating national association had to submit a final list of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) at least 10 days before the tournament started. These players were shortlisted from a provisional list of 35 players, including a minimum of four goalkeepers. All players must have been born on or after 1 January 1995. If a player listed in the final squad suffered a serious injury up until 24 hours before the kick-off of his team's first match, he could be replaced by a player from the provisional list with the approval of FIFA's medical and organising committees.\nIn July 2015, it was reported that the New Zealand squad had included an ineligible player, South African Deklan Wynne not having completed the requisite period of residence in New Zealand.\nGroup stage.\nThe winners and runners-up of each group and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16. The rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows:\nAll times are local, New Zealand Standard Time ().\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best ranked third-placed teams also advanced to the round of 16. They were paired with the winners of groups A, B, C and D, according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of regular time (two periods of 45 minutes), extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. In the case of the third place match, as it was played just before the final, extra time was skipped and a penalty shoot-out took place if necessary.\nThe third-placed teams which advanced to the round of 16 were placed with the winners of groups A, B, C and D according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award.\nGoalscorers.\nWith five goals, Viktor Kovalenko and Bence Mervó are the top scorers in the tournament. In total, 154 goals were scored by 100 different players, with six of them credited as own goals.\nOrganization.\nEmblem and mascot.\nThe official emblem of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013. The official mascot, a black sheep named Wooliam, was unveiled on 30 November 2014.\nTicketing.\nPrior to being released for 'General sale' on 13 June 2014, registered footballers in New Zealand were given 'priority treatment' by allowing them the option to buy tickets from two months earlier.\nIn the first three months of tickets going on sale to residents, an estimated 25,000 were sold."

Mullen has played both forward and defense throughout his career. He is the son of Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Mullen.\nEarly life.\nPatrick was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Linda and Joe Mullen. He has two older brothers and a younger sister. Their father is a Hockey Hall of Fame forward. He graduated as an honor roll student from Upper St. Clair High School in Pittsburgh.\nPlaying career.\nMullen played junior ice hockey for the Sioux Falls Stampede in the United States Hockey League (USHL) during the 2004–05 season. He registered 37 points in 60 games, fourth on the team; he also led the Stampede in plus-minus with a +11 rating. After the season, Mullen chose to attend the University of Denver (DU) in part for the coaches and the city of Denver.\nPrior to his first season with the Pioneers, Mullen was named Preseason Player to Watch by \"College Hockey News\". He scored his first career goal in a 4–2 win against the Air Force Academy, helping DU to their first win of the year. He finished the year with 7 goals and 17 points in 37 games, tying for sixth on the team for goals and points. The following season, he recorded four multi-point games, though he only managed to duplicate the 17 points recorded in his freshman season. Mullen spent most of the season on forward, but also played four games as a defenseman. He missed the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) playoffs after contracting mononucleosis. Following the conclusion of the season, Mullen was named to the All-WCHA Academic Team.\nIn the 2007–08 season, Mullen began the year playing defense. Though he did spend some time at forward, Mullen led all DU defenders in scoring by season's end. In back-to-back games leading up to the WCHA playoffs, Mullen received two 10-minute misconduct penalties. As a result, head coach George Gwozdecky suspended Mullen for the first game of the playoffs. Mullen returned from his suspension the following game and helped the Pioneers to an eventual WCHA tournament win. In his senior season, Mullen set career highs in assists and points while leading Denver in blocked shots. At the conclusion of the year, he was again named to the All-WCHA Academic Team and was awarded the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award. \nUndrafted out of college, Mullen signed a two-year entry-level free agent contract with the Los Angeles Kings on 3 April 2009. Playing with the Kings farm team the Manchester Monarchs, Mullen recorded his first professional point, an assist, in his first game, a 6–3 victory over the Albany River Rats. His first professional goal came almost two months later in a 4–2 win against the Springfield Falcons. After playing 36 games for the Monarchs, Mullen was sent down to their ECHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign. After playing only one game for the Reign, he was recalled by Manchester. He finished the year playing 8 more games for the Monarchs bring his total to 44 and recorded 4 goals and 10 points in his first professional season. In the playoffs Mullen played two games without recording a point. In his second season Mullen received more responsibilities after being added to the Monarchs power play unit, and while he played mostly on defense, he did see some ice time at forward. With the changes he doubled his production to 20 points in 67 games. During the off-season Mullen was re-signed by the Kings to a one-year contract. In his third season he again double his point production registering 41 points in 69 games. He also played in 4 playoff games for the Monarchs registering a goal and three points.\nFollowing the completion of his contract Mullen left the Kings organization as a free agent and signed with the Vancouver Canucks. Due to the depth on defense on Vancouver Mullen was not expected to make the Canucks out of training camp. With the 2012–13 lockout approaching Mullen was assigned to the Canuck's American Hockey League affiliate, the Chicago Wolves. In his second game with the Wolves Mullen suffered an injury to his left shoulder. The injury required surgery which ended his season. Despite his limited playing time in Chicago the Canucks re-signed Mullen to a one-year contract in the off-season.\nOn 4 March 2014, Mullen was traded by the Canucks to the Ottawa Senators organization for Jeff Costello.\nIn the 2015–16 season, his third within the Senators' organization, Mullen was traded by Ottawa to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Conor Allen on 14 January 2016.\nAt the conclusion of the season and out of contract with the Predators, Mullen as a free agent left North America and accepted an initial try-out contract with Latvian club, Dinamo Riga of the KHL on 27 July 2016. He saw the ice in 39 KHL games, tallying four goals and eight assists, before parting ways with Dinamo on 13 December 2016. On 2 February 2017, having agreed to return to the AHL with the Binghamton Senators, Mullen was claimed off waivers by the Rochester Americans and played out the remainder of the 2016–17 season in collecting 14 points in 27 games.\nAs a free agent, Mullen opted to return abroad in agreeing to a two-year contract with Swedish outfit, Linköpings HC of the SHL on 10 July 2017. On 15 February 2018, he left Sweden for German DEL side Adler Mannheim, joining the team on loan for the remainder of the 2017–18 campaign.\nIn August 2019, Mullen moved to British EIHL side Belfast Giants. Mullen left Belfast in 2020. He rejoined the Giants in March 2022 as injury cover."

        "text": "Joe Emerson Spencer (August 15, 1923 – October 24, 1996) was an American football tackle and coach who played in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and the National Football League (NFL). He is often mistaken for the notorious advertising sales rep, Joe Spencer. He was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948 and the Cleveland Browns in 1949 before playing two seasons with the Green Bay Packers.\nSpencer grew up in Oklahoma and attended Oklahoma State. He played football there in 1942 before spending three years in the U.S. Army during World War II. He returned to finish his college career in 1946, and the following year was selected to play in the annual East-West college all-star game. After graduating, Spencer signed with the Dodgers in the AAFC, playing there for one year. He then joined the Browns, who won the AAFC championship in 1949. He retired after two more years with the NFL's Packers.\nSpencer started a coaching career in 1953 as an assistant at Austin College. He became the school's head coach between 1955 and 1960. He then took a job as the offensive line coach for the Houston Oilers, who won the American Football League championship in 1961. He later served as an assistant coach with a variety of other AFL and NFL teams, including a 1968 New York Jets team that won Super Bowl III. Spencer died of cancer in 1996. He is a member of Austin College's athletics hall of fame, and the school named its coaching lifetime achievement award after him.\nEarly life and college.\nSpencer was born in Cleveland County, Oklahoma and attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City. After graduating, he enrolled at Oklahoma State University and played on the school's football team starting in 1942. After his first season, however, Spencer left Oklahoma to serve in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was in the Army's 2nd Armored Division and was the player-coach of its football team, which won the European service championship in 1945.\nAfter the war, Spencer returned to Oklahoma State for the 1946 and 1947 seasons. In 1947, he was chosen to play on the West team in the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. Spencer had been selected by the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League in the 1945 draft, but he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference after graduating in 1948.\nProfessional career.\nSpencer played as a tackle both on offense and defense for the Dodgers in 1948, when the team finished with a 2–12 win–loss record. As the Dodgers struggled on the field, the team also struggled financially and was forced to merge with the New York Yankees after the season. That left a number of former Brooklyn players available for other AAFC teams, and the Cleveland Browns signed Spencer.\nSpencer played for the Browns during the 1949 season, when the team finished with a 9–1–2 win–loss–tie record and won the AAFC championship. He was then traded to the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, where he played for two seasons and was the defensive captain before retiring due to an injury.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from football, Spencer launched a coaching career. His first job was as an assistant coach at Austin College in Texas starting in 1953. He was promoted to head football coach in 1955, and held that position through the 1960 season.\nSpencer was hired as an assistant coach for the Houston Oilers in the American Football League (AFL) in 1961. The Oilers, who were coached by fellow former Browns tackle Lou Rymkus when he joined, won the AFL championship that year. The team finished with an 11–3 record the following season, but lost the championship game to the Dallas Texans. Spencer stayed with the Oilers until 1965.\nSpencer moved to a coaching job with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League in 1966 and 1967. He was then hired in 1968 as the offensive line coach for the AFL's New York Jets, who were led by Weeb Ewbank, one of Spencer's coaches when he played in Cleveland. Led by quarterback Joe Namath, the Jets finished the 1968 regular season with an 11–3 record and beat the heavily favored Baltimore Colts to win Super Bowl III. Spencer stayed with the Jets through the 1970 season.\nSpencer became the offensive line coach for the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals in 1971 before taking a similar role in 1972 at the University of Kansas. He coached at Kansas under Don Fambrough through the 1973 season. Spencer's next stop was as an assistant for the World Football League's Chicago Fire in 1974. The Fire disbanded after the season, however, and Spencer got a job as an assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he coached for six years. He then took a job as an offensive line coach for the New Orleans Saints in 1981. The Saints hired Carl Mauck in 1982 to work with Spencer coaching the linemen, and the following year Spencer was moved to quality control coach. He stayed in that role through the 1985 season.\nLater life and death.\nSpencer and his wife, Betty Jo, had two children. He died of cancer in 1996. In 1997, Austin College established the Coach Joe Spencer Award for Meritorious Service and Lifetime Achievement in Coaching in his honor. The award is given to Austin College alumni and staff who have distinguished athletic coaching careers. Spencer was also inducted into the Austin College Athletic Hall of Honor in 1969."

Mark Rakita of the Soviet Union lost only to Pawłowski in the final pool, forcing another bout to break the tie between them for gold and silver; that barrage bout was decided by a single point as Pawłowski beat Rakita 5–4.\nPawłowski and Pézsa were the sixth and seventh men to win multiple medals in the individual men's sabre. Pawłowski's gold medal was Poland's first in the event, tying the nation with Cuba, France, Greece, and Italy for second-most all-time, behind Hungary's 11.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Six of the eight quarterfinalists from 1964 returned: gold medalist Tibor Pézsa of Hungary, silver medalist Claude Arabo of France, bronze medalist Umar Mavlikhanov of the Soviet Union, fifth-place finisher Emil Ochyra of Poland, sixth-place finisher Marcel Parent of France, and seventh-place finisher Walter Kostner of the United Team of Germany (now competing for West Germany). \nThe only time that Hungary had competed in the men's sabre event and not won the gold medal was 1900 (Hungarians placed fourth and fifth that Games). Hungary had not competed in the event in 1896 or 1904. Beginning in 1908, the Hungarians were unbeatable. Coming into the 1968 Games, Hungary had won 9 straight gold medals and 11 of the past 12—missing the gold medal only in 1920 when the nation was not invited to the Games following World War I. Pézsa, defending Olympic champion and 1967 world championship bronze medalist, was the nation's strongest hope of keeping that streak alive, but he faced stiff competition. Jerzy Pawłowski of Poland had taken the Olympic bronze medal in 1956, won the world championship in 1957, placed sixth at the 1960 Olympics, finished in the top 16 at the 1964 Olympics, won the world championship again in 1965 and 1966, and finished second in the world championship in 1967. Mark Rakita of the Soviet Union was the reigning world champion, winning over Pawłowski and Pézsa.\nWest Germany, competing separately for the first time, made its debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 14th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 St. Louis Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1968 tournament continued to use a mix of pool play and knockout rounds, but with substantial changes from 1964. The first two rounds were round-robin pool play, followed by a knockout round, finishing with another pool for the final. Early-round barrages were eliminated and the knockout round was a modified double elimination round."

        "title": "Basketball winning streaks",
        "text": "This is a list of notable winning streaks in basketball.\nEarly competitions.\nEdmonton Grads.\nThe Grads were a semi-professional women's basketball team from Canada from 1915 to 1940. They had a lifetime winning percentage of 95% and had several winning streaks of dozens of games each including every game they played at the 1924 Paris Olympics (where basketball was a demonstration sport).\nFIBA.\nThe United States men's national basketball team had a 58-game winning streak from the 1992 Olympic Games to the 2002 FIBA World Championship.\nNCAA streaks.\nOn January 19, 1974, the UCLA Bruins lost a basketball game to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, 71–70. It ended a streak of 88 consecutive victories, which coincidentally began after losing to Notre Dame exactly three years earlier on January 19, 1971. The streak encompassed 88 games, an NCAA division I basketball record eclipsing the 60 game streak of San Francisco in 1956. The streak is still an active Division I men's basketball streak, but the Division I basketball streak was matched when the University of Connecticut women's basketball team won a game against Ohio State on December 19, 2010, and the old record was eclipsed when the team won their 89th consecutive victory against Florida State on December 21, 2010. UConn's streak ended at 90 games, after losing to Stanford, who was the last team to beat UConn before the start of the streak. That was the longest winning streak in Division I College Basketball history for seven years, until UConn surpassed it after they won their 91st straight game. UConn's 2nd winning streak ended at 111 straight after losing to Mississippi State on March 31, 2017, in the semi-finals of the NCAA tournament 66–64 in overtime.\nSan Francisco – men's basketball – 60 games.\nIn 1950, Phil Woolpert, a high school coach at the time, took over as head basketball coach of the San Francisco Dons when Pete Newell left to coach Michigan State University. The school had no gym, and arranged for practices at a nearby high school. The team went 44–48 in its first four seasons, and was not expected to be very good in the 1954–1955 season.\nThe team started off the season with three wins, then lost to UCLA 47–40. They would go on to win 60 consecutive games, including two national championships, and the first undefeated seasons in NCAA basketball history. Two of the players on the squad for the first 55 games of the streak, Bill Russell and K.C. Jones, became stars for the Boston Celtics.\nAfter winning their second national championship in 1956, Russell and Jones graduated. The team then won five more games. Before the streak officially ended, they lost a game, when they took on the US Olympic team. Both Russell and Jones were on the Olympic team. The streak ended officially on December 17, 1956, when Illinois beat San Francisco 62–33.\nUCLA streak – men's basketball – 88 games.\nWhen the 1970–71 basketball season started, the reigning national champion was UCLA, having won its sixth championship in the spring. They started the season with a five-game winning streak from the previous season, and would win their next thirteen games, reaching a winning streak of 18 games. In addition to the consecutive wins streak, the UCLA team had won 49 consecutive games against non-conference opponents.\nHowever, on January 23, 1971, UCLA played Notre Dame at Notre Dame. Austin Carr scored 46 points, leading the Irish to an 89–82 victory. Six days later, UCLA would win their next game against Santa Barbara, the start of the new win streak. The following game was against their local rival USC, who was undefeated at the time, and ranked number two in polls, one position ahead of UCLA at number three. UCLA won the contest 64–60, and would go on to win the rest of the games that season, winning their fifth consecutive National Championship (seventh overall) and pushing their winning streak to 15 games. There was little attention to the streak at the time. The existing NCAA Division I basketball record was 60 games, and UCLA itself had had longer streaks in its history, winning 47 consecutive games during Lew Alcindor's time. In addition, the media attention was more focused on the NBA-ABA bidding wars, as the professional leagues were attempting to entice college players to join the professional ranks.\nInterest in the streak grew late in the 1971–72 season, when it reached 40 games. The media reports of the games began including the streak count in the headline about this time. By the end of the season, the UCLA team had won another national championship and stretched the streak to 45 games. In the following season, Coach John Wooden acknowledged the streak, but tried to downplay it. According to Bruins guard Greg Lee, \"Tonight, Coach Wooden did mention our long win streak, but told us not to think about it. Speaking for the team, I know I'm not thinking about it. I don't worry about losing when I go to bed.\"\nSan Francisco, the holders of the record at the time, had chances to end the streak, but they lost twice, accounting for wins 58 and 73. After UCLA tied the 60-game NCAA Division I record, the following game was against Notre Dame. The Irish lost by 19. Win number 75 was the National Championship of the 1972–73 season. Immediately after the game, rather than staying to celebrate, junior Bill Walton headed to a meeting with Sam Gilbert to discuss a possible offer from the Philadelphia 76ers for a reported $2 million. However, Walton returned for his senior year.\nIn the 1973–74 season, UCLA had a close call against Maryland, but ended up winning by a single point for win number 77. They won number 79 against North Carolina State by 18 points, although they would later lose to the eventual national champions in the NCAA semifinals, the first team other than UCLA to win the national title since 1966.\nOn January 19, 1974, UCLA played Notre Dame after beating Iowa 66–44 for its 88th consecutive victory. UCLA had beaten Notre Dame during the streak, although the streak started after a Notre Dame win in 1971. Digger Phelps, the 32-year-old coach of Notre Dame, decided to change his game plan from his previous strategy. The strategy largely worked. Although Walton hit 12 of 14 shots, the UCLA team was not often able to lob the ball into Walton. Even during the game, the eventual outcome was far from obvious. The Bruins outplayed the Irish in the opening minutes, building a 17-point lead. The Bruins held a 70–59 lead with under four minutes to go in the game, but the Irish ended the game on a 12–0 run, winning 71–70, and ending the longest NCAA Division I men's basketball streak at 88 games.\nUConn streak – women's basketball – 70 games.\nIn March 2001, UConn had won their second national championship a year earlier, and was headed to the NCAA tournament as a number 1 seed. They had only lost two games during the regular season, once to Tennessee, and once to Notre Dame, each of whom were number one seeds in the tournament. However, the UConn squad had lost Svetlana Abrosimova, an All-American who would be drafted seventh in the WNBA draft, to a season-ending foot injury. They also lost the 2000 Sports Illustrated Player of the Year, Shea Ralph, to a season-ending knee injury during the Big East tournament final. The depleted UConn squad won their first four games to advance to the Final Four in St. Louis. Their opening game was against Notre Dame, a team they had lost to in the regular season, but had beaten to win the Big East Championship game. The UConn team had a twelve-point lead going into halftime of the semi-final game, but fell behind in the second half, and lost to the eventual National Champion. That would be the last game they would lose until 2003.\nUConn started the 2001–02 season with two relatively easy wins, beating Fairfield on November 9, 2001, 93–50, and two days, later, beating FIU 91–47. Next up was perennial power North Carolina, but the Huskies prevailed 94–74. In December, they beat Oklahoma 86–72, the closest game of the season to that point. The next challenge was Tennessee in January 2002, but UConn won 86–72. UConn continued to win throughout the season, ending the regular season with a record of 30–0.\nThey won the rest of the Big East Conference matches easily, and entered the NCAA tournament as a number 1 seed. The semi-final game was against a two seed, Tennessee, but the game was not close, with UConn winning 79–56. The national championship game was against Oklahoma. The game was close until the final seconds, with UConn winning its third national championship, completing its second undefeated season, and finishing the year with a 39–0 record.\nThe 2002–03 season opened with a win over Wright State 85–39. After beating North Carolina State, UConn traveled to Hawai'i, where they would meet their prior year National Championship opponent in the final of the Rainbow Wahine Classic. UConn would again prevail, winning 73–60 for their 44th consecutive win. The biggest challenge to the streak would come in the 51st game, a home game against Tennessee. The game would go into overtime, with UConn prevailing by a single point 63–62. The following game against Rutgers would also be close, but UConn won 67–62.\nUConn played a strong Duke squad at Cameron Indoor Stadium on February 1, 2003, but managed to win 77–65. They finished up the regular season without a loss, and reached the Big East Tournament with a 68-game winning streak. They won their first two games in the Big East Tournament easily, then faced Villanova, a team they had beaten in January by twenty points, 58–38. This game would turn out much differently, with Villanova achieving an upset, knocking the UConn team out of the Big East Tournament, and ending the NCAA women's basketball win streak at 70 games.\nUConn streak – women's basketball – 90 games.\nThe loss before the streak begins.\nThe 2007–08 season started with a lot of promise. UConn faced fourth-ranked Stanford in the Virgin Islands, but won 66–54. The team would reach the end of the regular season with only a single loss, at Rutgers 73–71, then won the rematch at home 66–46. However, the team lost two starters to injury, Kalana Greene and Mel Thomas. UConn won the first four games of the NCAA tournament, but then faced a rematch with Stanford, who won the semifinal game 82–73. That would prove to be the last loss for some time.\n2008–09 season (wins 39-0).\nUConn opened the season against Georgia Tech, a team unranked in the pre-season. The game was tied at the half; UConn went on to win by eleven. The fifth game of the season was against Oklahoma, a team ranked number 4 in the polls. Characterized as a \"significant test\" by ESPN's Graham Hays, Connecticut would win easily by 28 points, 106–78.\nAfter winning their first 17 games, Connecticut faced the number two ranked team in the nation North Carolina, also 17–0 for the season. UConn was ranked number one, but had just lost starter Caroline Doty to a season-ending knee injury in the prior game. Despite the loss of Doty, the game did not turn out to be the close game anticipated. UConn reached a double-digit lead early in the game, extended to a 46-30 halftime lead, and finished with a 30-point victory, 88–58. All five starters, including Lorin Dixon in her first start of the season, would each score in double digits, led by Renee Montgomery with 21.\nDuring the rest of the regular season, only Notre Dame and Rutgers played UConn to within ten points, with each team losing by exactly 10. The team entered the Big East tournament with a 30–0 record.\nNeither of the first two rounds of the Big East tournament were close, with UConn defeating South Florida by 37 points, and Villanova by 30 points. The final was expected to be a contest, because Louisville had a record of 29–4 and was ranked seventh in the nation. However, with eight minutes to go in the game, UConn's Maya Moore had scored 28 points, while the Cardinals had only 27. UConn went on to win 75–36.\nConnecticut won the first four games of the NCAA tournament easily. That set up a rematch with Stanford, the last team to beat UConn. This time the UConn team prevailed, winning with a score of 83–64. The national championship game was between UConn and Louisville, a team UConn had beaten in both the regular season and the Big East Championship game. Connecticut won the third meeting as well, 76–54, winning their sixth national championship and completing their third undefeated season.\n2009–10 season (wins 39-0).\nThe Connecticut team opened the year ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll, following a 39–0 record leading to a national championship in the prior season. In both cases, the polling results were unanimous. UConn graduated three seniors, Renee Montgomery, Tahirah Williams and Cassie Kerns, but only Montgomery was a regular starter. The team added one freshman, Kelly Faris, and Caroline Doty returned to the line-up after missing most of the prior season due to injury.\nDespite working toward their 40th consecutive win, the focus in the early part of the season was not on the streak, but on other accomplishments. In the opening game against Northeastern, Tina Charles scored her 1000th career rebound. In the same game, Kalana Greene scored her 1000th career point. After winning their ninth game of the season, and extending their streak to 48 games, UConn faced Stanford at home. Both teams were undefeated, and were ranked first and second in the polls. Stanford's last loss was to UConn in 2009, and UConn's last loss was to Stanford in 2008. For the first time this season, UConn trailed at halftime. However, in the second half, the Huskies moved out to a large lead and ended up winning by 12 points.\nAfter winning its next six games, UConn faced Notre Dame on January 16. The game was notable because it was the first ever ESPN \"College GameDay\" held before a women's basketball game. Both teams were undefeated; UConn at 16–0, ranked number one in the country and Notre Dame had a record of 15–0, with a number three ranking. However, the game would not be close. UConn led at halftime 42–19, and won 70–46.\nUConn went on to win the rest of their regular season games, ending the regular season with a record of 30–0, and extending their overall streak to 69, just one game shy of the NCAA Division I women's basketball record of 70, established by UConn in 2003. UConn won the regular season Big East title, so they had a double bye into the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. Their first game would never be close, with UConn leading at the half 44–17, and ended with a 77–41 victory. UConn's Tina Charles would tie her career high with 34 points, while Maya Moore would score the 2000th point of her career, ending the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds and 7 assists. The win would be UConn's 70th consecutive win, tying the record for the longest winning streak in the history of NCAA Division I women's college basketball, set by the Huskies in 2003.\nThe Big East Tournament semi-final game was against Notre Dame, the third match up between the two teams this season. UConn won 59–44, to set a new NCAA women's basketball winning streak record at 71 games. However, the team was focused on upcoming games and \"didn't even celebrate\". UConn would go on to win the Big East title match against West Virginia 60–32.\nUConn entered the NCAA tournament as a number one seed. Their first-round game was against Southern—UConn won 95–39. The second-round game was against Temple, coached by Tonya Cardoza, who had been an assistant at UConn for 14 years. This was the first meeting of the two teams since Cardoza took over the position. UConn limited the use of the starting team, but still won 90–36. UConn then beat Iowa State 74–36 and Florida State 90–50 to advance to the Final Four.\nThe national championship game was between Stanford and UConn. Stanford would go to halftime with a 20–12 lead. The 12 points scored by UConn was the lowest first-half total in the history of Connecticut basketball.\nMaya Moore led the team after the half, scoring 11 of the team's first 17 points, including the basket that put Connecticut back into the lead, this time for good. Moore would end up with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for the Final Four. Connecticut would go on to win 53–47, ending their streak of double-digit victories, but winning their 78th consecutive game, resulting in their seventh National Championship, their second consecutive undefeated season and their fourth overall undefeated season.\n2010–11 season (wins 36-2).\nUConn opened the 2010–11 season with a win over Holy Cross, 117–37. The next game was against Baylor, the number 2 ranked team in the country. Baylor jumped to an early lead 8–3, but UConn came back, and held an eight-point lead at the half 35–27. Although UConn hit a three pointer in the opening seconds of the second half to extend the lead to double digits, Baylor responded with a 29–10 run to take an eight-point lead 56–48 with about seven minutes to go. Bria Hartley scored eight of her nine points in the last four minutes of the game to help UConn hold on for a 65–64 victory.\nUConn's next opponent was Georgia Tech, the team involved in the first game of the streak. The win by UConn was the 81st consecutive, tying Washington University, a Division III team, for the longest streak in NCAA women's basketball. UConn hosted the World Vision Classic over Thanksgiving. In the first of the three games, UConn easily beat Howard 86–25, to set the new record consecutive win streak for NCAA women's basketball at 82 games. UConn then went on to beat the other two opponents in the Classic, Lehigh and LSU and then extended the streak to 87 games with wins over South Florida, Sacred Heart and Marquette.\nThe following game was the Maggie Dixon Classic, held at Madison Square Garden. Two of the four teams playing in the double-header were top-ranked UConn and 10th-ranked Ohio State. UConn won the game 81–50 to tie the NCAA basketball consecutive wins streak held by UCLA.\nOn Tuesday, December 21, 2010, UConn hosted Florida State in Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. Maya Moore scored a career-high 41 points, but the emphasis was not on individual stats. The game represented the 89th consecutive victory, the longest winning streak in NCAA basketball history.\nThe streak reached 90 games with a win over Pacific, but ended in with a 71–59 loss to Stanford at Maples Pavilion on December 30, 2010.\nUCLA and Notre Dame player reactions.\nBill Walton – \"They play with great sense of team, great purpose, phenomenal execution of fundamentals, relentless attack\", he said. \"It is what every team should aspire to, regardless of the sport.\"\nDwight Clay, the Notre Dame player who hit the winning shot to end the UCLA streak: \"Well, I think it's great. It's great for women's basketball and it's great for sports in general ... But, you know, what Connecticut has done, you know, I don't believe you can separate that. Eight-eight games is 88 games. That's a hell of a treat.\"\nUConn streak – women's basketball – 111 games (all games), 126 games (regular season).\nBeginning after their loss to Stanford in the fall of 2014, the Huskies went on two winning streaks of over 100 games—one of 111 in all games, and the other of 126 in regular-season games only. The 111-game streak included two national championships. During this streak, UConn made history by being the first team in NCAA Division I women's basketball to win four consecutive championships.\nOver the course of the 111-game streak, only three games were won by fewer than 10 points. The first was at No. 12 Florida State on November 14, 2016, where UConn won 78–76. The second game was at No. 4 Maryland in front of a sold-out crowd on December 29, 2016, where UConn won 87–81. The third was at conference foe Tulane on February 18, 2017, with UConn winning 63–60. Of their wins, 31 were against ranked teams. UConn defeated South Carolina 66–55 on February 13, 2017, at home, to record their 100th straight win.\nThe all-games streak ended at 111 wins on March 31, 2017, following a last-second 66–64 OT loss to Mississippi State in the semifinals of the 2017 NCAA women's tournament. The regular-season winning streak, however, was not affected, reaching 100 games on January 9, 2018, in an 80–44 Huskies blowout of UCF. That streak would not end until January 3, 2019, when UConn lost 68–57 at Baylor. This game not only ended UConn's 126-game regular-season winning streak, but was also the Huskies' first double-digit loss since a 13-point loss to Notre Dame in 2012.\nMen's D-I conference champion streaks.\nIf not for a 1-point loss to San Francisco in 2012, Gonzaga would have a streak of 23 consecutive WCC regular-season titles (including ties).\nKansas' streak and Gonzaga's current streak both include ties for first place. The Big 12 and West Coast Conference do not use tiebreakers to determine regular-season conference champions, only using them to determine the top seed in their conference tournaments.\nMen's D-I home court streaks.\nThe eight longest home court winning streaks in D-I men's basketball:\nWomen's D-I home court streaks.\nThe six longest home court winning streaks in D-I women's basketball have all involved the University of Connecticut (UConn), with three achieved by UConn and the others ended by a Huskies' win.\nOn December 29, 2003, UConn faced NC State with a chance to step into the history books. The Huskies had won 68 consecutive home games. The NCAA record for consecutive home victories was held by the Tennessee Lady Vols, set in 1996, and ended by the UConn Huskies. UConn beat the Wolfpack easily, 87–53, to tie the record at 69 games.\nFive days later, UConn faced Duke, with a chance to take over sole possession of the home court win streak. However, Duke was ranked fourth in the nation, so the outcome was far from certain. UConn unveiled new silver uniforms for the game, and at the end of the first half, the record seemed in sight. UConn led the game 35–18, almost doubling the score of the Blue Devils. However, the Huskies hit on 56% of their free throws, and Alana Beard scored 21 to get Duke back into the game. Jessica Foley hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to win the game for Duke, 68–67, and end the quest to extend the longest homecourt winning streak.\nIn 2012, UConn had a home winning streak of its own. After eclipsing the prior records of 69 games, the Huskies had gone on to win 99 in a row. They attempted to extend the record to 100 consecutive games against unranked conference foe St. John's. UConn had not lost a game to an unranked team at home, a stretch covering 19 years and 261 games. However, the Red Storm won 57–56 to end the home court winning streak at 99. With that streak ended, the nation's longest active home court winning streak was held by Stanford, at 76 games.\nOn December 29, 2012, UConn defeated Stanford at the Cardinal's home court to end Stanford's 82-game winning streak at home.\nIn 2014, Baylor tied Tennessee and UConn for the third place for home consecutive victories with their 69th win. In the bid to win their 70th game, they faced UConn. The two senior starters on the Baylor team, Odyssey Sims, the nation's scoring leader, and Makenzie Robertson, daughter of head coach Kim Mulkey, had never lost a game at the Ferrell Center. The game was reasonably close late in the second half, but UConn went on to win by eleven points, 66–55 to end Baylor's home court win streak.\nThe current longest home winning streak is held by Baylor, at 47 games as of January 10, 2020. On that date, the Lady Bears ended the previous longest active home winning streak by defeating UConn, preventing the Huskies from tying their record 99-game streak.\nMen's D-II road game streak.\nThe NCAA does not list a record for consecutive road wins in its Division II men's record book.\nMen's D-III road game streak.\nThe NCAA does not list a record for consecutive road wins in its Division III men's record book.\nU Sports.\nUniversity of Winnipeg Wesmen streak – women's basketball – 88 games.\nThe Lady Wesmen would go on to a record 118–1 in the span from 1992 to 1995, including 3 CIS (now U Sports) national basketball championships and beating several NCAA Women's Division I programs in North American tournaments.\nAAU basketball.\nWayland Baptist – women's basketball – 131 games.\nThe Wayland Baptist University Flying Queens women's basketball team was one of the predominant women's basketball team in the 1950s. In 1954, they began a winning streak that would reach 131 games, and included four consecutive AAU National Championships.\nHigh school basketball.\nBoys' basketball.\nThe Fredericton High School (Fredericton, New Brunswick) junior boys' basketball team won 207 consecutive games between 2006 and 2012, including five Provincial championships. The team was coached by Gary Young.\nPalmer High School, located in Palmer, a town of 270 in northwest Iowa, has the 5th longest winning streak in the country. Palmer's 103-game win streak from 1986 to 1989, is still the Iowa high school record, and ranks as the fifth-longest in the United States.\nAll of the games were coached by Hall of Fame Coach Alden Skinner, who had a career record of 380 wins against 108 losses for a winning percentage of 77.9%.\nThe streak included State Championships in 1986 (26–0), 1987 (26–0), and 1988 (27–0).\nIt started with the beginning of 1985–86 season and ended in the State semifinals in 1989 with a 60–56 loss to eventual State Champion Keota. Palmer came back to win the consolation game. In those years, Palmer was one of the smallest high schools in the state of Iowa, with just 17 boys in the four grades of high school in 1988.\nTwo members of that team, Troy Skinner and Brian Pearson, both 1988 graduates, are members of the IHSAA Basketball Players Hall of Fame, and played at the University of Iowa, and Iowa State University respectively. One team also had a long winning streak in the upper peninsula of Michigan. A small town called Powers, and the North Central High School Jets, coached by Adam Mercier.\nGirls' basketball.\nThe Baskin High School women's basketball team holds the record for longest winning streak in organized sports. The Lady Rams won 218 consecutive games from 1948 to 1953—a span of six years. Once the streak was broken, another 71 game streak continued. In the span of ten years, the Lady Rams led by Hall of Fame coach, Edna \"Tiny\" Tarbutton, would go 315 and 2 with 9 state titles and an average winning margin of more than 30 points. In 1993, Tarbutton was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame located in Natchitoches.\nNBA streaks.\nLos Angeles Lakers – 33 games.\nThe 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers won 33 consecutive games without a loss, the longest undefeated streak in NBA history.\nThis streak was challenged by the 2012–2013 Miami Heat, who won 27 games in a row before losing to the Chicago Bulls, and by the 2015–2016 Golden State Warriors' 28-game win streak (including 4 from the previous season), which ended with a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

        "text": "Golf on USA is the umbrella title for USA Network's coverage of the PGA Tour and other golf events. in the United States. USA Network's own coverage of the PGA Tour ended after the 2006 season. USA also covered the early rounds of The Masters Tournament from 1982 until 2007. The network also carried the Ryder Cup Matches regularly from 1989 until 2006, as well as overflow coverage in 2010.\nBeginning in 2022, USA returned to golf coverage, airing NBC's early round coverage of The Open Championship, U.S. Open, and their women's counterparts, replacing Golf Channel. In 2023, the Ryder Cup, one of the original golf events on USA, would also be added to the schedule.\nCoverage overview.\nUSA was also, separately, the cable home of the Masters Tournament from 1982 to 2007. USA's sister network, Universal HD, broadcast The Masters in high-definition (one of the first golf tournaments to ever hold that distinction).\nThe Masters Tournament.\nThe USA Network began first and second round Masters coverage in 1982, which was also produced by the CBS production team. This was the first ever cable coverage for one of the golf majors. Initially, the USA Network provided Thursday and Friday coverage for 2 hours live each day along with a prime time replay. In 1995, USA expanded the Thursday/Friday coverage to 2.5 hours each day. In 2003 and 2004, both CBS and USA televised the Masters commercial-free. In 2005, USA increased the Thursday/Friday coverage to 3 hours.\nOther events covered by USA.\nThe Shark Shootout, which began in 1989 as the RMCC Invitational, was originally broadcast in the United States by the USA Network and CBS, with USA broadcasting the first round on a tape-delayed basis, and CBS handling the second round live. Not all the country saw the final round live, as CBS' commitment to the NFL only allowed part of the country to see the round as it takes place, with the rest of the U.S. seeing the event beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. In 2007, the event was moved to December, and was broadcast live by both Golf Channel and NBC.\nThe end of USA's coverage.\nIn early 2006, it was announced that USA was outbid by Golf Channel for its early-round PGA Tour rights, with USA's final season being 2006. NBC/Universal, parent company of USA Network, traded away the network's Friday Ryder Cup coverage through 2012 to ESPN for the rights to sign Al Michaels. However, USA did renew its Masters contract for an additional year. USA would televise the 2007 Masters before being outbid by ESPN for future coverage. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities.\nThe Ryder Cup contract, which stipulated cable coverage air on USA, was still controlled by NBC even after it granted ESPN the rights to Friday cable coverage (normally the only day of the event covered on cable). However, in 2010, rain on Friday pushed the singles matches to Monday, necessitating that they air on cable. With NBC having granted only Friday rights to ESPN, the singles matches aired on USA. Four months later, NBC merged with Golf Channel, making Golf Channel NBC's primary cable outlet for golf.\nReturn.\nIn November 2021, it was announced that early-round coverage of the Open Championship, U.S. Open, and their women's counterparts, would move to USA Network beginning in 2022. In 2023, the Ryder Cup was also added to USA’s schedule."
